1048420,5,6305596247,"i never would have thought that they would release the 20th anniversary edition of Piranha, but they did! and it's GREAT!
if you thought you were safe in the water by swimming in rivers, think again! Piranha's might be near you.
they actually did a very good, two thumbs up job on cleaning and sharpening up the movie for your DVD viewing pleasure.
when shown on TBS, it tends to be very blurry, but WOW, they really did an excellent job in sharpening the image and quality of the this all time cult classic.
i haven't seen all of the special features, but it has plenty.
for those who grew up in the late 70s or early 80s and liked cheesy horror films, or grew up to the films shown on TBS, then Piranha is your film!!!",1065052800,3,720,4.262773722627737

1048423,5,6305596247,"A classic B-movie with Nikki Newman in it (Melody Thomas Scott). She looked wonderful as usual wearing her cute cut jean shorts & sweet shoulder-exposed ruffled halter top. 1978 when Nikki was how old? The minute she stepped on the summer camp scene in the beginning, I knew it was her & prayed they wouldn't kill her off.  She had many lines & all of them were with her natural-born flare & her cute facial & lips expressions. Blond, young and as sweet as the day Victor Newman met her as a stripper. But she wasn't stripping here, she was an innocent camp supervisor and played it super well. Her first part was small, and I was pleasantly surprised later when she appeared again & again. Screaming with everyone but of course like Nikki, she's so concerned about everyone she barely has time to save herself. If you're a Y& R fan like me & love to see the characters in the show, on other movies when they were younger, then I think you'll love this one. Enjoy it.",1045526400,2,967,4.402234636871508

I don't see why it's an 18 over here it's not that gory I've seen far worse.

1048425,3,6305596247,"Yes, I know John Sayles wrote this, and there ARE some good moments both in the action and characterization areas, but in the end, I'm afraid ""Piranha"" isn't a very good film. Way too many opportunities are missed that could have resulted in good scenes and interesting situations-- and, no, I'm not just talking about the goofy camp counselor interrupting his two nubile young employees just as they were about to disrobe for an impromptu midnight swim! But I'm recommending this DVD for two reasons: 1) Though the movie isn't very good, it certainly isn't boring, and 2) Joe Dante & Jon Davison's commentary track is terrific, loaded with anecdotes and inside information about Roger Corman's world of low-budget film making. This is yet another DVD (see also ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" and ""Humanoids From The Deep"") where the movie itself is one of the smaller attractions of a very entertaining disc!",1007424000,8,904,4.953947368421052

1048427,4,6305596247,"Joe Dante's Piranha is a very humorous spoof and a fine homage to Steven  Spielberg's classic Jaws. Though plagued with poor acting from Bradford  Dillman, Heather Menzies, and Keenan Wynn, this is definitely not the type  of film that you would ever take seriously. The inside film jokes and  cinema references add a lot of intelligent spice to the film's proceedings,  but it is the cheesy yet effective special effects by Phil Tippett  (Robocop) that make Piranha a must see for mosnter movie buffs. Watch out  for the obviously fake piranha as they make a spectacular bloddy debacle of  a children's summer camp. The DVD edition of Piranha has many elaborate  features including a Joe Dante commenty, a making-of-documentary, film  bloppers, and other theatrical trailers of Corman films. P.S. Joe Dante  would later go on to direct such horror classics as The Howling and  Gremlins.",959644800,25,887,5.041379310344827

1048594,4,6305596247,"PIRANHA THE SPECIAL EDITION turned into a fun ride circa 1978.  Not only was it great to see the theatrical version for the first time the Bonus features offer plenty of tidbits from movie commentary (Director Joe Dante and Producer Jon Davison) to bloopers, a home movie (with commentary) and The Making of PIRANHA doc with a boatload (heh) of interviews from cast and crew.
Director Joe Dante pulls no punches by stating it was no secret ...""we were making a ""ripoff"" of Jaws..."" and it shows in very first scene of movie when star Heather Menzies is playing a ""Jaws"" video game.
John Sayles (just a year away from penning very good The Lady In Red for Roger Corman too..) wrote PIRANHA with tongue nicely in cheek, sometimes asked to add a scene while on set in Texas himself.  He also has small acting role as soldier.
Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) took the part as Doctor Roark replacing Eric Braeden who refused to take role after seeing what film crew did to USC's Olympic swimming pool (made to look like underwater lake...).  ""I can't go in that water...""  He told Director Joe Dante.  USC had to drain and ""blast"" the pool before it could be used again...!  Something actually grew in there, Dante added.
Dick Miller is a blatant ripoff of Murray Hamilton's ""mayor"" character in JAWs.  All that was missing from Dick Miller's wardrobe was the cheesy anchors on his suit coat.
Pino Donaggio as composer for a movie of this NON-magnitude was a major coup.
I found it interesting PIRANHA  was actually released same time as JAWS 2.
This is B-movie entertainment that was well made (only $660,000...):  What you cannot necessarily see from the speedy Piranha attacks is certainly made-up for with those ""swarming, ravaging, sound effects.""  Vicious.  And don't worry bloody too, as was the demand of Corman.
Easy, gory 4 star rating with subtle, in-movie-joke humor.",1486944000,,1890,4.7846153846153845

Spielberg called it ""the best of the Jaws ripoffs"". It's always fun to spot the random character actors that show up in these low budget films.

1048698,5,6305596247,"just watched the not-quite-brilliant but clever and entertaining piranha (1978) for the millionth time.

i really, really love piranha. bradford dillman and heather menzies are adorable; i mean, how could a young, hot blonde not find a middle-aged drunkard recluse irresistible? but they work, balancing each other out with equitable displays of ingenuity and compassion. and it's always nice to hang out with joe dante regulars kevin mccarthy and dick smith, plus the gorgeous and icy barbara steele shows up, not to mention script-writer john sayles and eating raouel director paul bartel.

the piranha attack scenes are examples of spare brilliance, cut so quickly with just he right sound effects to not only be realistic, but also maddeningly effective, making every bite hurt. as with any corman produced flick, the makers of piranha knew how to stretch a dollar, but also how to hide its' cheapness. the location scouts really did their jobs, cuz between the woodland cabins, the cool military research installation, aquaworld or whatever it's called, and especially the flooded sewage plant, piranha looks bigger than it is because they found cool a$$ places to shoot it. these are skilled filmmakers at work. joe dante is ever the under-appreciated director, and piranha is just a symphony of smart b-movie beauty. joe always delivers great pacing packed with loving nods to fifties b-movies and old cartoons. rob bottin contributes spirited make-up effects, and we even get some stop-motion courtesy of phil tippett.

piranha aint jaws, but there's certainly nothing wrong with it it.  vastly superior to alexander aja's remake (and the 1995 tv movie travesty), the piranha is this film are working their way down a river, towards the ocean and unstoppable aquatic domination, not just stuck in a lake in super land-locked arizona.  more entertaining and smarter.",1437264000,,1873,5.250836120401337

1048776,4,6305596247,"Piranha, one of the first JAWS ripoff's made by Roger corman's company New world pictures
Piranha was filmed about 2 years after JAWS was released in cinemas
Piranha more of a suspense thriller than an actual Horror
but not a bad Jaws ripoff in terms of Joe Dante's first Directing Debut which is pretty Good Directing Debut
Joe Dante's brings lots of suspense to the scenes that's for sure
plus some Great Acting performances
by Kevin McCarthy, Bradford Dillman who had played the Police chief in Clint eastwood's The Enforcer 1 year earlier
Dick miller, Barbara steele, Heather menzies also give Great performances
also some Good special effects by special effects artist Rob Bottin who created the Piranha fish
and i mean only some good effects cause the technology was not that Great back in the 70's
especially with creature effects, some of the Piranha scenes do look ridiculous, not scary.
it's a matter of opinion really

Shout factory have now released the film on DVD & BLU-RAY with all new special features
Making of Piranha retrospective featurette only goes for 20mins, should've gone for maybe 30mins
new interviews with mainly the production crew & only few of the actors from the film
 Director Joe Dante, Producer Jon Davison, executive producer Roger corman
special effects creature artist Phil tippet & other crew members that were involved in making the film
Actors Dick miller, Belinda balaski are interviewed, Actress Melody anderson is interviewed to only for 2mins thou
Barbara steele & Bradford Dillman are not interviewed for some reason maybe they declined
Kevin McCarthy died back in 2010 he was 96
and Heather menzies who was Bradford Dillman's co-star in the film
she left the business over 20 years ago so of course Heather is not interviewed
there's also some behind the scenes footage in B/W mainly of the special effects crew
working on the Piranha fish, only goes for 9mins
there is no Audio thou Joe Dante & Jon Davison do a commentary over the footage
there's also some added scenes that were inserted back into the TV broadcast version,
about 10mins of added scenes only Digital remastered in 1:78:1 ratio
there's also some Bloopers & some outtakes aswell
there's also a new feature length Audio commentary by Joe Dante & Producer Jon Davison
the commentary is very informative & worth listening to
Joe & Jon just give retrospect comments about the film & the casting & the Piranha fish
there's also Behind the scenes Photo Gallery from Phil tippets personal collection
Theatrical trailer, TV spots & radio spots of course

both formats by shout factory were released the same year 2010 with the exact same special features
the only difference is the picture quality & the sound quality actually
the DVD release is only Digital remastered transfer in 1:78:1 ratio
which i used to have, but i've sold it and bought the blu-ray version instead
the blu-ray version has a new High Definition transfer in 1:78:1 ratio which is big difference in quality
much sharper & clearer picture than the dvd version in my opinion anyway
unfortunately cannot say the same for the sound quality which is only a average LC stereo mix
a new 5.1 Master audio mix would've been better for sure
a new 5.1 mix should have been given for the blu-ray version, ridiculous

as i said both formats have the exact same special features
except the dvd has a Digital remaster transfer
the blu-ray version has a new High definition transfer, massive difference in picture quality
so up to you what you Decide
about 4 stars for this blu-ray version based on lots of new extras & an excellent HD transfer",1427932800,2,3607,4.85064935064935

1048847,4,6305596247,"Pirhana holds up quite well over time compared to many other creature attack films from its era, and even ones made in the decades after. This one adds to the fun that it is deliberately made to parody the highly successful film Jaws that was released earlier in the 70's, with the same sort of opening scene, naked teens go swimming and don't make it back out the water, footage of kids splashing around on inflatable equipment from underneath looking up at their feet. A deliberate attempt to stop any news of the bloodthirsty fish being out there so as not to affect potential tourists to the newly built resort (well maybe that was Jaws II).  We don't get to see much of the Piranhas like we didn't see Bruce much in Jaws, so the front parts of fish ramming back and forth into a body part with red colouring the water works quite well.  Oddly though we do get to see some weird walking fish type character in the government lab that never comes into contact with the human characters or really does anything.  You can clearly tell that creature has been added after filming was done.  It doesn't really add anything to the film other than giving you as a modern day viewer the thought, well that's sort of like the Gremlins characters in a film made later by the same guy.

The storyline as you would expect is pretty weak at times (some spoilers follow).  Somehow the main two actors who are stupid enough to drain a pool full of piranhas into the river ignoring the warnings of the employee and instead deciding to beat the crap out of him when he trying to stop them pulling the lever, can build a really great raft with the trees they cut down all being the same length, free of branches and so on.  Later on you wonder why doesn't he just turn on the siren instead of risking a head on when he can't get around the ""sunday driver."" You've also got an old man fishing who after the first nip keeps both legs dangling in the water until they are stripped of flesh down to the bone, ignoring the natural reflex of moving a limb away from pain. Piranha also relies on soldiers getting distracted and letting their guard down seemingly having never seen a pair of breasts before and a very dim-witted overweight sheriff who enters a cell under a similar I'm a helpless woman pretence.

The two main characters also aren't that likeable so you really don't care for them.  The guy is constantly swigging from a flask and the woman's disdain for the fact she is on someone else's property, wether it was the guy she made drive her to what he thought was an abandoned facility, then to break in further when it is obvious it is actually still operational was annoying, as with both of their lack of remorse or taking ownership of the fact they released these human flesh stripping fish into the environment, even going so far as to blame the beaten employee for it.  It's frustrating watching at times and has its faults but overall is worth at least viewing once and is better than a lot of similar films of the 70's and 80's.",1419984000,,3029,4.431654676258993

1048849,5,6305596247,"I recall seeing this one on cable TV back in the '80s. Definitely one of the cult classics of the mid to late 1970s craze of ""animals going crazy"" theme going on: Grizzly, Day of the Animals, Frogs, Food of the Gods, Swarm, Squirm, Kingdom of the Spiders, Empire of the Ants. Seeing the success of JAWS in 1975, Roger Corman set out to ride the ""wave"" so to speak of success. I would have to say it definitely was an original, no one had done a horror movie about Pirahna before. Sharks, well he was beaten to the punch. Actress Heather Menzies (The Sound of Music), is seen playing the JAWS video game in the scenes after the opening title.  Roger Corman did want to shelf this movie because he thought the budget was going too high, but later reconsidered.

Joe Dante directs and does audio commentary as well and talks quite extensively on how this came to be what is now considered a cult classic by many.
The Blu-ray comes with a reversible graphics cover, (which is what I believe all should have) and a nice booklet inside talking about the movie. Although not restored, it does look good for the age of the movie print that they used. To me, it's an improvement over the previous DVD version that was not Widescreen.

The Blu-ray itself is quite good for a 35 year old plus feature and it doesn't disappoint with all the extras. The menu design is great with watery effects like bubbles and music in the background. The Title ""Piranha"" is in Red, of course, with moving, wavy letters.

After not hearing from them, Maggie Mckeown (Heather Menzies) is hired to find them, and while searching for them she runs into an old lush by the name of Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman). They come upon an old Army test site and after investigating the place, they learn that the teens were in fact there. Maggie then makes a decision that would soon spell disaster for a host of innocent people. -summary

Following the success of Stephen Spielberg's Jaws in 1975, that depicted a great white shark running around chomping people away, many film makers would come up with their own tales of nature gone wild; from grizzly bears to killer whales. Everyone would try to get in on the action, but I can only recall two movies that would creep pass the realm of mediocrity; Enzo Castellari's 1980 Great White aka The Last Shark, and Joe Dante's 1978 Piranha. Although these would go on to be pretty entertaining movies, they would not be on the same level as Jaws, simply because they lacked that true horror element concerning the tension build up of the approaching shark. My memory on The Last Shark is pretty vague, but I can tell you that Piranha doesn't really capture that feel. However, Dante's decision to provide the viewer with some nifty gore effects, high speed chomping action, and hilarious sound effects kind of makes up for that lack of tension. Piranha is definitely one of the more fun horror movies once it finally hits second gear.

The first half of the movie is pretty slow, and for me, really does have some boring moments that always comes close to putting me to sleep. For some reason, I was never too attached to the characters. I found them passable at best but not annoying. I never really cared for the reason behind Grogan's drinking habit at all. In which, Dante, did choose to dig into his past in order to help with the character development. I was more interested in the back-story surrounding the killer fish actually, and how they were mutated to survive in different water climates. I think this added some depth to the story.

The plot becomes interesting once the couple learns that the killer carp have two all you can eat buffets to choose from; one being a summer camp of children and another is a tourist resort before they decide to hit the ocean. It becomes a race against time in hopes of preventing the inevitable. Two aspects of the movie I really enjoyed was the lack of romance, and how Dante decided to keep things simple. Few things annoy me more than a couple finding time for some casual sex, or a big kiss before preventing the apocalypse. The pacing is done rather well and once the film hits the second half, all hell breaks loose and it's lunch time after that.

These fish are seriously no joke; when they really get the chance to eat their victims, they eat them all. They attack without remorse and this results in some very good scenes. The amount of gore is actually surprising, and the special effects watching the fish munching on feet is pretty good. The film has aged pretty well to me. I thought the acting was solid across the board, but Dillman delivered the best performance I think.

I won't give specific details on the ending, so I'll just say I liked how it finished. Overall, Piranha is one of the better nature gone wild films. Some folks may be put off by the gore, and up to this day still I will never understand why someone would watch a horror movie and complain about gore; but anyway, this is something that serious horror fans and B-movie lovers can get into.

Pros: Nice gore effects, 2nd half

Cons: Some boring moments in 1st half",1412640000,,3789,4.563235294117647

1048904,4,6305596247,"Something I realized last night while watching Piranha... it's just not as scary as it was when I was a child. I remember watching Piranha and thinking ""Oh My God. You're not safe in the rivers or the oceans. If it's not giant sharks it's flesh eating fish"". That terrified me.

Don't get me wrong. Piranha is still awesome and a cult classic. This is the first time I viewed Piranha since I was a child. I did it because I want to see the original before they release the remake on DVD this month.

One thing that got me laughing was the noise the Piranha made when attacking. That shrill little mini-lawnmower sound. I laughed so hard.

What I loved was the fact that nothing was taboo. They went after and attacked small children. Awesome. Most horror or cult classics don't go there. Piranha did. Kids swimming in the lake... who cares? Send the Piranha in and let 'em feast.

Thank goodness it's all in fun.

What really gets me is seeing a Piranha in real life. They say that Piranha are NOTHING like the movies portray them as. There is only one type of Piranha that can do the damage like in the movies... the Red-Bellied Piranha.

Mostly real piranha eat what they can from fish to dead animals floating in the water and rarely attack humans... kinda like the Great White Sharks being compared to Jaws.

So Piranha seem to have the same fear factor as a Great White Shark does. All because of the movies. There is a small chance of being hurt by Piranha or a Great White Shark. However, the likeliness of this happening is slim.

The plot is a little far fetched considering there are no piranha's in the US, they do exist in South America and other Countries. I do believe the movie would have been better if the location was in the Amazon, but considering the goof this movie made it. This is one fish movie that didn't flop out to dry land.

1048913,4,6305596247,"Classic Jaws rip-off from Roger Corman is a lot of fun mostly because it playfully acknowledges its inspiration yet, becomes its own movie and is all the more entertaining for it. The story revolves around a school of genetically altered piranha in a remote mountain military research station. When they claim the lives of two teens, the investigator searching for them, Maggie (Heather Menzies) and her reluctant, alcoholic mountain guide, Paul (Bradford Dillman) accidentally free the ferocious fish into the local river and are now frantically trying to stop them before they reach a summer camp and a water theme park. Piranha is gory and campy but, not without some tense sequences too as when the carnivorous fish attack the summer camp filled with kids. The cast has fun but, treats their roles just serious enough to make it work and that allows the audience to buy into it just enough to have a good time. Directed with equal parts humor and horror by Joe Dante (who went on to direct The Howling and Gremlins) from a witty script by Howling scribe John Sayles, Piranha transcends its rip-off status to become a classic in its own right. Also stars Kevin McCarthy as the scientist who created them, Barbara Steele, Keenan Wynn and Corman regulars Paul Bartel, as a grumpy camp counselor and Dick Miller, as a shady theme park owner. Another Corman flick filled with talents who would go on to their own fame and fortune.",1397174400,4,1429,4.813008130081301
1048955,5,6305596247,"If Roger Corman is involved with a movie you'll get you're fair share of the three B's of B Movies: Babes, Boobs and Blood!! Piranha doesn't disappoint in any department; they even threw in a lot of Booty just to 'round' things out!

It's the 70's, so we have a woman over-compensating to fit into a male dominated field of employment, Private Investigator or Skip-tracer.  Shes brash, pushy and fails to think ahead, but she's cute and perky and has great 70's hair.  She is looking for a young couple (we don't know why), but, alas, they have already fallen victim to the deadly hoard.  They broke a cardinal rule, NEVER, I mean NEVER break into a Super Secret Government Project, especially one with really old, rusty signs but perfectly maintained containment pools. Another cardinal rule is dashed as they decide to go 'skinny-dipping', a serious no-no if you want to survive a B movie.  Okay, so the long and short is, the Piranha escape when the perky PI decides to purge the pools to look for the bodies of the recently deceased.

The rest of the movie is chasing the hungry fish down river always arriving after the hoard chews through the area.  They are heading towards the Summer Camp where innocent children play and swim in the river, and, GASP, the hero's daughter is spending the summer, but she's probably okay because she's afraid of the river.

Okay, so what I'm trying to say is, Piranha is a whole lot of fun if you don't take it or yourself too seriously.  This is for sure a 'cult classic' and the price is just right!!

1048960,4,6305596247,"Joe Dante's good for those B greats that keep dishing out the fun through the years. The suburbs had gremlins, the woods were overcrowded with werewolves, and now we're in the peaceful, tranquil mountains where the lovely waters are filled with flesh craving, blood frenzied piranha. Kind of limits where to my spend my vacation next year.

The story begins simply enough. A teenage couple sneaks off into a barbed wire area to and decides to jump into a pool. I know how they must feel - when in the mood, I'm sure the most enticing place would happen to be something that's sealed like Fort Knox. Unknown to them, of course, the water is filled with scientifically altered, genetically engineered piranha. After the bodies are inevitably munched and disappear, investigator Maggie McKeown drains the pool, releasing the fish into the river. Of course she doesn't know she did this - yet. She ventures nearby to question hermit, leave me the hell alone, Paul Grogan. While on a raft, they run into piranha chomped bodies, including an old man whose legs have been chewed to bits. Eventually their discoveries lead them to realize the fish aren't going to stop anytime soon, and that they really need to screw their thinking caps on tight to get out of this mess.

Piranha is a spoof of Jaws and never claims to be something different. It was made for 600,000 but earned 30 million - definitely a big paycheck there. Fun and with a good pace, Dante does some great directing with piranha POV shots and such, but weaknesses are present as this was his first job. The piranha look pretty cheesy but oh well - lack of budget has to show somewhere, it's usually in the effects.

The cool 'bird' noise they make when they flock together for a kill is amusing, and the acting it a bit weak but characters are rounded out enough to be interesting - especially the poor dog. Scream queen Barbara Steele even makes a guest appearance at the end. Overall the body count is relatively high, deaths are a bit corny but great to watch, and these are some mean ass fish. What could be much better? The ending is more on the predictable side (what else could someone come up with?) but suspense was high when they were on the mission and for this I give more kudos to Dante.

Without much more to say on the film (after all, the depth of it doesn't run as deeply as the river), it's spoofy, it's fun, entertaining, imaginative enough, and definitely worth a rent or buy.",1379635200,,2455,4.572727272727272

Always the joker, Dante keeps his tongue placed firmly in cheek all throughout this silly play on JAWS. In PIRANHA, the vacationers at the Lost River Resort are attacked by a mutant strain of carnivorous fish that are mistakenly unleashed from a secret research facility up river! The sly humor that makes its way into the film keeps the mood high in spite of the terrible violence that is unfolding all around. As fake as the rubber fish may look, the quick cuts used during their fevered feeding frenzies conceal their cheap designs behind a crimson shroud. From the opening scene, the river runs red as the piranha mow down everything in their path, but nothing can compare to the bloody feast that awaits them at the river's end (save for Alex Aja's ridiculous remake). Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies do their best to keep a straight face as they run around warning people of the fishy menace, while Corman favorites Dick Miller and Paul Bartel pop in with a pair of amusing cameos along with the late Kevin McCarthy, who hams it up as the kooky geneticist that is responsible for all of the madness. Of the many JAWS imitators that surfaced in the late 70s, PIRANHA is easily the most enjoyable, and offers a surprising amount of staying power now thirty years since its initial release!

1049031,5,6305596247,"Piranha is the best example I have seen of precisely how to do a rip off. It may sound like an oxymoron to call a rip off impressive, but this is what accurately describes Piranha. Today, we have the Asylum, a direct-to-DVD company which gives us so-called ""mockbusters"" that completely lack the heart and fun of a film like this. Instead, those are merely dull ""just-going-through-the-motions-to-make-a-small-amount-of-money"" displays of ineptitude.

There are several things to strongly commend this movie for, like the fact that the lead characters are likable so that you care what happens to them (unlike in some horror films), the way it is very self-aware and has small tributes to Jaws, the campy sound effect of the school of fish, the excessive amounts of blood that is shown in a comic manner, and how it is genuinely comedic and yet not a pure spoof in the way that films like Scary Movie are. Basically, the film comes just close enough to Jaws to be an obvious attempt to cash in on its success, and yet also stays just far away enough from Jaws that one isn't bored by a repetition of the same story all over again.

I also feel that this film did something well that I don't typically see in creature feature films. And that is that it maintained a good balance between the screen time that the piranha attacks had, and that the background story about the people and the origin of the problem had. I say ""piranha attacks"" because admittedly, the fish themselves are hardly shown close-up at all, but it didn't really feel as if I was missing anything by not seeing very much of their fins. Usually, the scenes involving the creature itself are short as well as far and few in between, while I am bored with all the meaningless dialog (a good example of this is ""Demon of Paradise"" where I was thinking ""When do I get to see the monster?""). But in this movie I did not have that disappointment.

As a matter of fact, the scenes where the human characters are talking actually interested me and had me curious what would happen next. It is very rare for me to enjoy these types of scenes.

See this movie if you like B movies, by all means. However, if you aren't a fan of that type of cinema, Piranha probably won't convert you. We all have different tastes. I know people who simply don't enjoy a schlocky low budget B movie, even if it's great at being what it is. As for me though, I'll take this little exploitation film over Jaws, because it's just more fun.

There may be a slight hiccup regarding one of the lead actors, but otherwise, the film unfolds in almost textbook fashion, as a school of deadly genetically engineered flesh eating fish, is released into the waters of a river.  The highlights of the film are probably the feeding frenzies that occur when the piranha attack at a water park, and a kid's summer camp.

Piranha features legendary filmmaker Roger Corman (Death Race 2000, Not Of This Earth) as producer, Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) as director, and John Sayles (Men With Guns, The Howling) as screenwriter.  Special effects were rather limited back in 1978, but the film is still highly effective using rubber fish, gallons of fake blood, an intense whining sound when the fish are swarming, and lots of agitated water, in the piranha attack scenes.  The image quality isn't always that good, but this new anamorphic widescreen version may be the best the film has looked on DVD and Blu-ray.

The story begins with two young people being attacked and killed by something, while taking a dip in a pool at a restricted facility.  The disappearance brings investigator Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) to Lost River Lake to try and locate them.  She enlists Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) to act as her guide, and while investigating the same restricted facility, McKeown accidentally releases the piranha from the pool into the adjoining river.  The pair encounters Doctor Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy), who eventually informs them that he was conducting genetic research on the piranha for the military.

The fish soon begin feeding, killing people on their way downstream, heading toward a camp where Grogan's daughter is staying.  By this time the army has become involved, taking control of the situation, commanded by Colonel Waxman (Bruce Gordon) and with Dr. Mengers (horror queen Barbara Steele) as an advisor.  Waxman tries to restrict the activities of Grogan and McKeown, by keeping them in the local jail, but they get away and try to and prevent a disaster at the camp.  Unfortunately they are too late, as the piranha attack a group of young children.  After munching on the kids, the swam moves on to the water park where the real bloodbath takes place.

Paul and Maggie take a small boat to a refinery, where Grogan has to turn a submerged valve, to release toxins that will kill the piranha, before they can reach the ocean.  Grogan pulls up far away, and has to swim a long distance.  He manages to hold his breath for a remarkable period of time (3+ minutes), as the carnivorous fish attack.  There are some good views of the little chompers ripping into his flesh.  Grogan completes his mission, but is left bleeding and in shock, as the film closes ambiguously, with the piranha assumed to have all been killed.

The special effects and gore in Piranha may not be particularly impressive, when compared to the CGI piranha in the 2010 remake, or modern films featuring CGI and other special effects.  It is however an example of how effective the imagination can be, when combined with some rudimentary effects and tricks.  The film does go for the jugular, showing little kids screaming in churning red waters.

Bradford Dillman was great playing a by the book cop in The Enforcer (1976), but he seems less appropriate as a heroic man of action.  While he is mostly serviceable here, bringing experience to the role, Dillman just seems a curious choice.  His character Grogan, getting romantically involved with the much younger Maggie, seems pointless since what happens is very brief, not explicit, and not developed any further.

Heather Menzies Ulrich was a good casting choice, a beauty with decent acting skills, her career at the time was doing very well, starring with Gregory Harrison in the TV version of Logan's Run.  If you can imagine Menzies co-starring with someone like her real life husband Robert Urich, or Gregory Harrison, this might have been a very different movie.  With veteran actors Kevin McCarthy and Keenan Wynn making only brief appearances, Dillman and Menzies do manage to carry the film.

There is a decent set of bonus materials, including a commentary by director Joe Dante and producer Jon Davidson that while quite light and humorous, is still rather informative.  Some tidbits of interest discussed include how the piranha attack scenes were filmed, what Dante learned shooting with a low budget film on a tight schedule, and how a body double was used for Heather Menzies' nude scene.",1300492800,,4716,4.963104325699746
1049090,4,6305596247,"If you're gonna rip off Jaws, might as well do with with some flair, eh?  Since Jaws was basically Corman on a budget anyhow, why not?
It's one of the more fun ""nature strikes back"" films of the 70s, and the key to this is Joe Dante.  Unlike most films of this type, Dante(and screenwriter John Sayles)knew better than to try and be 100% serious about all this.  I don't think this movie would be half the classic it is if tried to mimic the suspenseful tone of Jaws.
Once again, Corman makes ten dollars look like a hundred.  The film is obviously low budget, but it looks very professional, and more expensive than it actually was.  The piranha carnage is exceptionally well done, shown in very quick and frantic cuts, not giving you time to really identify anything as looking fake.
Performances are good across the board, especially the all too brief one by the late Kevin McCarthy(who sadly passed away recently).  I don't know what it is about Bradford Dillman, but I've always liked him since I first saw him in Escape From The Planet of the Apes.  I never thought the guy had a humorous bone in his body, but he manages to get a few chuckles out of me in this.
Like most of the recent Corman output, there's a short documentary featuring Corman, FX artist Chris Walas, Joe Dante, Dick Miller, and Dante regular Belinda Balaski.
Piranha is schlock.  You and I know it's schlock, Dante knows it's schlock, Corman knows it's schlock, and your mother knows it's schlock.
But it's such fun and enjoyable schlock.",1295136000,,1515,4.564575645756458
1049091,4,6305596247,"This is the best ""Jaws"" inspired/horror creature comedy of the mid 70's to the early 80's next to ""Alligator!"" Joe Dante (Director of ""The Howling"" and ""Gremlins"") has taken something that has been done since 1976's Grizzly and turned it into a cult following... plus this is one of the very few creature features of the mid 70's to the early 80's that has been remade with a big budget by it's side! I also mad a music video on ""You Tube"" titled ""Piranha Movie(s) Video Tribute Using a Song by Uncle Dog Food"" and I bet any fan of Piranha movies knows what song I am talking about!

Plot: Killer mutant piranha have been unleashed into the nations waterways by two unknowing citizens one who is the town drunk (Played excellently by Bradford Dillman) and the other a woman (Played amazingly by Heather Menzies-Urich) who is looking for two college kids who they find out have been devoured by the powerful piranha and so will a lot of other people who don't know of the dangers below this calm lake.... the doctor (Played Superbly by Kevin McCarthy), the town drunk and the skip-tracing company woman must find a way to kill the unstoppable hungry piranha from attacking the camp, the brand spankin' new lake side resort and it must all be done before they reach the ocean!

Review: I absolutely adore and appreciate that Bruce (Steven Spielberg's Lawyer whom which Steven named the infamous shark after) decided to drop charges against this film mainly because Steven Spielberg enjoyed and felt comfortable watching this rip off and he had high praise for it (Unlike other films such as ""Great White"" (1982) which still to the date this review was written hasn't been released on a suitable DVD and was yanked from theaters on its opening weekend for copyright issues!) This film astounded me as much as it appalled me... I do believe that Children in Peril are one of the cheapest and most insufficient effects in horror/thriller/sci-fi flicks that can be used! But this one doesn't just have Children in Peril; it has children actually being eaten piece by piece in some of the most gnarly special effects in a killer fish film of the 70's I've seen in a long time which really raises the bar into the MPAA rating... Jaws was an Acceptation for ""PG"" but Piranha went all out and got itself a solid ""R""! The Story was basic but the characters and dialogue had such a great blend that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a fake horror/comedy type creature feature that packs some seriously needed bite... Jaws was just an appetizer for those hardcore gorehounds and Piranha was the whole meal.... The special effects were good in the lab scene but after that it was obvious that the fish were being pulled up and down on a stick and the camera just taking quick shots of them munching on flesh! Now when I see that I think of Alien (1979) in which the creature (when it has the chance) uses its second mouth to impale its victims yet the shots are done very quickly so either it doesn't show the fake head or the fake mouth! Piranha has great atmosphere to it to... it felt like a water park scenery mixed with a little bit of backwoods action to add a great blend of superb genius! I do believe however that the score was the best thing about this movie (Which cost $15,000 to make on its $660,000 budget) because without that and the sound of the piranhas they wouldn't have made the film work so I am overly proud of Roger Corman and Joe Dante's creepy creation!

Acting: Bradford Dillman (Whom also played in ""The Swarm"" That same year) plays a character much different than that of ""The Swarm"" he's gone from mayor to a town drunk and he does a great job portraying both roles. Heather Menzies also created a lively and risky character, one that isn't as afraid as she is determined to get the job done (She played in a snake movie called ""SSSSSSS"" 5 years earlier and yes there are seven S letters) Kevin McCarthy does a splendid job creating a character who although is crazy is very passionate about people's lives and he regrets creating the fish in the end! All the rest of the cast are good in there own way.... I have to give due credit to the side-characters that were being attacked by the piranhas in the end... I do believe that the kids to adults acted very realistically as if something under the murky water was nipping at them! It had very well put together actors for short!

Gore: Kids getting chewed (*SPOILER ALERET* but none get killed ""in the camp scene the only person who dies in that scene is one of the camp councilors *END SPOILER*), lots of bloody nibbling, there are a few scenes with very bloody corpses and there is also a lot of bloody wounds in towards the end! It wasn't over all gory but violent-in-concept, most definitely and that's what I believe scored it the ""R"" rating, that and the T/A!

Bottom Line: The DVD/Blu Ray is definitely worth a buy for the special features, film, and picture quality... I haven't seen this much special features on a low budget 70's creature feature movie's release in a long time! The film is a treasure for the ages and it has amazingly well put together actors and a great script that they can work with! The main problem I had with this movie was the special effects, I felt the action scenes were somewhat dull and the death of the piranha was cool at best but unoriginal and uncreative at worst... I do appreciate the scene when they are about to *HINT* supposedly *END HINT* kill the piranha because of the intense build up to see if the person was going to be able to or not... if you watch this awesome movie you'll know what I mean!

Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for intense sequences of violent animal attacks, some grisly images, nudity, and brief drug use

Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10
For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4 (I would give it four and a half but sadly the site won't let me rate it that way)",1290038400,,5912,4.478664192949907

Co-starring Kennan Wynn, this New World Pictures and Roger Corman produced cult Science Fiction horror comedy is the debut of well loved genre director Joe Dante whom have been working with New World for a long time and gets his debut along with Robocop and Starship Troopers producer Jon Davison. Since ""Jaws"" was a huge massive success and was once the highest grossing movie in film history before ""Star Wars"", there has been many imitators such as ""Tentacles"", ""Squirm"" etc. but the best ""Jaws"" imitation was definitely this. Why it works? because the scripting is witty and the direction is well made with good pacing, the special creature effects are done by Rob Bottin who had an early career here before working with Dante again on ""The Howling"" and ""Twilight Zone The Movie"". It's a true genre favorite for many years that earned a good fortune at the box-office and fair reviews, i always loved this movie since i was a kid and it spawned a sequel made none other than James Cameron himself including 2 remakes with the later one being the only cool one while the TV remake just stunk.

This Blu-Ray offers a very nice picture despite a few grains in some scenes but the audio is very great too. There are plenty of terrific extras like audio commentary by Dante and company, behind the scenes footage, bloopers and outtakes, additional scenes from Network television version, radio spots, TV spots, Trailers to this movie and other New World movies on Shout Factory, photo gallery and poster-and-still gallery.

This blu-ray release does the movie justice. Solid transfer (in original widescreen), good sound, and nice extras. For the price, it's definitely a bargain.

The film has become the stuff legends are made of. Not only did it launch the career of a noteworthy director (as did its sequel) but it also spawned two separate remakes, with the latest being what looks like this summer's biggest guilty pleasure film. But before all that was the little film that could, an unlikely b-movie underdog that does its job surprisingly well. Because of this movie, you will believe that fish on sticks can be threatening.

Before he would go on to become a big name in the horror genre in the 1980's, director Joe Dante (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gremlins/dp/B000P0J0A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gremlins</a>"") let loose on this shoe-string budget b-flick. Although the film has little style, it gets by with a strong sense of humor and its oddball assortment of characters. Heather Menzies plays Maggie, a video game obsessed insurance investigator who is thrust into the arms of Bob Vila look-alike Paul (Bradford Dillman) -- a bitter drunk with a dry sense of humor -- when she sets to the wilderness in search of a missing couple. The two inadvertently stumble upon a military experiment, letting loose a school of blood-thirsty fish into the local lake where a delicious feast of fat tourists and innocent children awaits them.

Although sorely dated, ""Piranha"" is not without its charm. A young Rob Bottin provides some surprisingly decent special effects and make-up, while Dante keeps the pace of the film moving effectively, especially in its ridiculous final act, which just so happens to feature an explosion so random it probably keeps Michael Bay up at night in fits of jealous rage.

While ""Piranha"" never reached the status of ""Jaws"" it did provide B-movie fans with enough blood and gore to satisfy them and it quickly became a classic in its own right.

Far up into the hillside in an abandoned Army testing facility long after the Vietnam War, a lone scientist named Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) continues his genetic research on a school of mutant killer piranha. Nobody knows of the scientist's existence or the mutant piranha until some hikers go missing and a rookie detective named Maggie (Heather Menzies) stumbles across their gear at the abandoned facility. Maggie believes that the hikers stopped there so she enlists the help of an unlikely hero in the form of town drunk Paul Grogan, played by veteran character actor Bradford Dillman to help her search for them.

After Maggie foolishly drains the military containment pool in an effort to find the missing hikers, the two of them quickly discover the facilities deadly secret and it becomes a race against time to save the unsuspecting residents down river, including a kid's summer camp and the waterfront amusement park of Lost River Lake. Can Maggie and Grogan reach the summer camp and amusement park in time to save everyone? Can they stop the Piranha from reaching the ocean? Is there anything that can kill the Piranha? You'll have to buy your own copy to find out.

1049217,4,6305596247,"Joe Dante and Roger Corman went all out in taking advantage of the Jaws craze with this bit of B film madness and gore.

The hunt for two backpackers leads a detective and a drunken mountain man to a deserted Army post where weird experiments have taken place.  A bit of stop motion animation was fun to see, as little creatures are scurrying or cooing at who these humans are.  This is never expanded on and that's too bad.  I would have liked to see what happened to these animals when the adventure began.

Well, our dynamic duo stupidly let the piranhas loose into the river system by draining the basin where they were housed.  And double dummy scientist comes out of nowhere and wrestles with them with murder in his eyes.  If he explained that draining the basin would let dangerous fish loose, then they would have stopped and calmly explained their situation.  But then we would not have much of a movie!

Per the commentary, Roger Corman would check the rushes and say, ""More blood.  More blood!""  And boy did he get it!

The little fish have big teeth and the editing is done in such a way that the sticks holding them and the underwater crew are not noticed.  It is a bit cheesy but interesting how they did all that with such a low budget and tight schedule.

Be impressed with the blooper reel, Roger Corman's and Dante's interviews and trailers and ads for more of his crazy B Film madness.  Plenty of semi-nudity, lots of blood and gore.  What else could you ask for?  Dante went on with Gremlins, several other stars to soap opera greatness.

What makes this dvd a five star release is the amount of effort that Shout! Factory has put into it. While major studios release films with nary an insert or a special feature, Shout! has provided ""Making Of..."" featurettes, bloopers and gag reels, commentary tracks, tv spots, trailers w/commentary, poster galleries etc. They even provide a nice, informative booklet and reversable dvd artwork. I must say my favorite so far is the salacious reversable cover art for Humanoids From The Deep, another fine film.
For fans of Roger Corman, I believe 'Piranha' and 'Humanoids' is essential viewing. Piranha's director Joe Dante would later do films such as The Howling and Matinee, classics in their own right. Piranha is a violent, bloody exploitation film with liberal doses of humour that swims comfortably next to Orca, The Killer Whale when it comes to Jaws knock-offs and is heads and fins above other dreck like Barracuda and Up From The Depths!

They're all fun, but they both have their problems, just like Piranha.

Set in the rivers and surrounding area of Lost Lake, Piranha starts with two unhappy campers. Lost, they take a trail up into an old military facility that is seemingly abandoned.  They decide to go swimming, but as soon as they hit the water something...eats them. So Maggie McKeown, a lady whose job is to locate missing people is called in, and she and Paul Grogan, the local drunk, set out to the base where the two campers where last seen. That's when they accidently set them loose...A school of man-eating, intelligent, genetically-altered, voracious Piranha are heading downstream...toward a local summer camp and a just-opened resort.

The acting was surprisingly good, much better than other films of the time. Heather Menzies (Maggie) and Bradford Dillman (Paul) put effort into their characters, distinguishing this movie from other `70's horror films. (Except for Jaws, of course.)

But there's a lot more to the movie, and it's not just a horror film; at times it morphs into a comedy, with the characters cracking one-liners and saying the most ridiculous of lines. (""Horror, terror, death. Film at eleven."" Or: ""It's the fish sir. They're eating the guests."")

Yet Piranha, even though its plot sound's simple at first, leaves a lot of questions unanswered in the end. When our main characters are in the military base, just before they let the fish out, I would like to know just what the scientist was doing with fish. Weird creatures are being held in that laboratory, and one of them even gets out, wandering around and watching the characters. But then it disappears, and we never see it again.

And towards the end of the movie, how did the Piranha get so fast? (*Spoilers*) They reached the ocean in no time. The radio announcer was still telling what happened at the resort, and they were already there, at some unknown beach.

The park was once the oldest and most popular west of the Mississippi until more thrilling theme parks were born with roller coasters, etc. The resort used to have mermaids and scuba divers put on shows along with a swimming pig. Some couples were even married at the park in underwater ceremonies housed in the submarine theatre, the ""aqua arena"" that gave the resort its name.

The gondola rides are gone now but glass-bottom boat rides are still there. The university bought the park in 1994 to use as a preserve and study water and environmental resource issues by founding the Texas Rivers Institute. The area in which it was filmed (on the San Marcos River) is the most consistently inhabited region in all of North America, with archeological records showing a continuous presence for more than 12,000 years straight. Piranha is not the only film shot in San Marcos, a cozy college town in-between Austin and San Antonio, as the films The Getaway and The Ringer serve as other examples.

Viewers will get nostalgic to see the old Aquarena Springs and a time when San Marcos was small and even more laid back and uncorrupted by corporate chains. If you like silly, tongue in cheek flicks on a shoe string budget, you'll like Piranha.

1049338,3,6305596247,"Somehow this B horror movie manages to be entirely ridiculous, and yet still entertain. Piranha walks the thin line between intentionally campy and seriously trying to scare. And it does so better than most horror films. I think the grainy films of the 70's just work better for horror. When everything's crisp you actually have to have good acting, good script, and good effects.

This film has a mediocre amount of all three of those. The piranha (genetically altered by the government, MUTANT piranha, I mean) are never really seen clearly, so their realism isn't that big a deal. The plot revolves around some campers that go missing and a woman sent to find them. She somehow immediately decides they must have disappeared at the old abandoned military facility and breaks through the locked gate to get in. Then she decides to drain their pool to see if the bodies are there, unknowingly releasing mutant piranhas into a quiet Texas river.

What ensues is one of the sillier horror/action(?) escapades ever on the screen. The two heros travel down the river on a makeshift raft to warn everyone of the piranhas and make sure that the dam doesn't get opened, releasing the piranha on to a children's summer camp.

Of course, the piranha know when anyone is in the river at any point throughout and will be there to nibble them apart in a matter of seconds. Anyway, the film never bores and the gore is pretty believable. It's also got the gratuitous breast flashing expected in early horror movies, and the open ending.

The best part of the DVD is the blooper reel. If I had my way, every movie would have a blooper reel. This one is especially good, because they're from the 70's. How many blooper reels are 30 years old?",1168387200,3,1728,4.6743421052631575

Running Time:  94 minutes

Rated R for violence, gore, language, and nudity.

Piranha"" is a very engaging and often gross film, filled with tongue-in-cheek humor and very rich on cult aspects. Joe Dante's directing is sublime and John Sayles' screenplay (""Alligator"", ""The Howling"") terrifically blends black parody with genuine chills and exciting action. The story is well set in a remote Texas area where the mad scientist Robert Hoak (good supportive role by Kevin McCarthy) is still working on a new secret weapon to use in the Vietnam War, even though it's already over. 'Operation Razorteeth' revolves on artificially bred piranhas that are able to survive in cold saltwater and they reproduce at a dazzling speed. When the perky investigator Maggie (Heather Menzies) and the estranged drunk Paul (Bradford Dillman) accidentally allow these finned flesh-eaters to escape in the local river, it's up to themselves again to save the nearby tourist attractions from the ravenous little monsters. That's certainly not an easy thing to achieve, considering the fact there are many corrupt politicians, businessmen and army commanders who attempt to cover the whole thing up.

""Piranha"" is yet another fine example to demonstrate that the 70's were the most outrageous years for horror cinema. The witty script generally steals wholesale from Spielberg's ""Jaws"", but it's unscrupulous enough to add social mockery and even clean images of innocent children getting slaughtered.  Throw in some extra sleaze, camp, absurd characters and stylish music and you've got yourself one of the very rare true American exploitation movies.  Like it's pretty much the trademark of director Joe Dante (""The Howling"", ""Gremlins""), he stuffs his film with cinematic in-jokes and endless references towards other genre classics. The nasty little fishes devour their human victims in gruesome ways and what's left over isn't exactly pretty to look at. Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies do well as the leads, but its supporting cast in particular that is worth naming. The ""Roger Corman"" regulars Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Bartel shine as the hypocrite and greedy Texans, but the casting choice that is the most appealing is Barbara Steele as the female scientist Dr. Menders.  The pace of the film is good, and while the script shows some holes, the plot usually lasts out. It gets a bit hectic towards the end and Dante would have been better served with less carnage and more tension to give the movie a better finale. The effects are pretty much non-existent, as the movie just uses cuts of fish swimming and a bit of fake blood for most of it's shocks. Still, this is a very fun movie and one that people who enjoy a good time will enjoy.",1136678400,,2915,5.154661016949152
1049341,4,6305596247,"Where would we be without the venerable Roger Corman? Lovers of B-movie madness would likely have a lot more time on their hands to read books, interact with family, or take part in generally otherwise fulfilling life experiences had old Rog chosen a different career path. Fortunately, or unfortunately as the case may be, Corman sat out in Hollywood for three or four decades making low budget exploitation films. He also tried to cash in on every movie fad in modern cinema. And I do mean EVERY fad. You see, Roger had a dream to take an idea and make a profitable picture out of it that would entertain the masses. The problem was that someone else invariably had the idea first. Thus Lucas's ""Star Wars"" allowed Corman to unleash ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" on an unsuspecting public. Car chase movies saw Roger replying with ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""Eat My Dust."" I could go on and on. There wasn't anything Corman couldn't do with someone else's idea. Perhaps the best example is ""Piranha,"" a 1978 ripoff of Spielberg's ""Jaws."" This film made our man a lot of money, which allowed him to make even more spectacular ripoffs for years to come.

The flick starts with a couple of kids breaking into some sort of rundown fish hatchery for an evening swim. Something in the water kills them. End of movie. Seriously, something rather nasty does do away with the two idiots. We then see an insurance investigator by the name of Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies on loan from Julie Andrews) heading out to discover what happened to these two dolts. She rather quickly hooks up with an embittered alcoholic with a penchant for flannel named Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman channeling Grizzly Adams) who lives in a cabin down by the river. Somehow or other Maggie convinces Paul to head over to the fish hatchery with her. Sure enough they discover that something sinister has been going on there under the aegis of Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy). How do we know this? Because there's lots of nasty looking scientific stuff lying around all over the place. Anyway, Hoak eventually lets our two heroes in on a little secret: the government paid him a bunch of money to create a breed of piranha as part of some weapons program. Personally, I'm for anything that keeps communists out of our swimming pools, lakes, and rivers.

While all this nonsense goes on we know the piranha have escaped from the hatchery (thanks Maggie and Paul!) and are preparing a full-scale assault on the human race. A few locals fall prey first, but the real threat is the summer camp and an aquatic park downriver. Just to ratchet up the emotional element of the film a bit, we also learn that Paul's daughter is currently attending the camp. Oh dear! It's a race against time as Paul and Maggie set out with the twitchy Dr. Hoak in tow to stop the madness. As for the folks at the camp and the park, they haven't a clue as to what's about to happen. The only concern at the camp is the fascistic machinations of Mr. Dumont (Paul Bartel), a guy who takes great joy in ordering kids into the water and snooping on the foxy female counselors. At the water park, the owner plans on making a bundle on opening day and couldn't care less if a battleship full of exposed nuclear waste sailed into harbor. You can pretty much guess what happens in the last part of the film. Screaming, blood in the water, and a lot of out of shape Americans in unflattering bathing suits thrashing around on the beach in agonies. Fun!

I don't know whether to laugh or cry with this one, folks. Lots of people adore this film, and I probably would to if I'd seen it as a wee lad. I didn't, and I'm not that impressed. The swarms of piranha zipping through the water look so like the pieces of plastic they are that it's tough not to snicker. It's even worse when we see them up close chattering away on an exposed leg or belly. We're definitely looking at cheesefest central on a buck and a half budget here. At the same time, I did find a lot to like about the film. Seeing veteran horror babe Barbara Steele popping up from time to time as a government scientist named Dr. Mengers was a nice surprise, although she's largely wasted in the role. Kevin McCarthy plays frazzled well, and the script requires him to morph into a sniveling wimp for most of his screen time. Heck, we even see Richard Deacon (Mel from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"") in a small role as Maggie's boss. Can't beat that. The talent behind the camera is moderately impressive too considering the budget. Joe Dante directed this flick, and John Sayles wrote the script. Both men went on to greater success, Dante with ""Gremlins"" and Sayles with ""Eight Men Out,"" ""The Howling,"" and several other mainstream movies.

Extras on the disc include a commentary track, extra footage, bloopers, and a few other odds and ends. Corman apparently took this film, or at least a similar concept, to television in the mid-1990s. If so, I haven't seen that version and thus cannot make a comparison. If the remake, or retread, or whatever it is looks and sounds like this movie, more laughs await us. Corman continues to churn out pap at an alarming rate, and has even recently inked a deal with Disney that will release his entire catalogue on DVD and keep it in circulation until the sun burns out. I've dogged on Corman quite a bit, but I do appreciate his films. If nothing else they are entertaining, and this one definitely works most of the time.",1128729600,18,5453,4.566905005107253

Dante, directed The Howling, and Gremlins, both films have so many hidden tributes to other films I can't count them all. Now back to this film, based on the unprecedented success of Jaws, sooner or later ripoffs come. But this isn't a ripoff, characters differ hugely, unlike Grizzly(read my review), and humor is splattered throughout, where Jaws was in the whole, intensely serious.

It's highlighted by numerous peripheral cuties with the alluring Belinda Balaski (from ""The Howling"") and Melody Thomas Scott (from ""The Young and the Restless"") featured in fairly prominent roles.

You could really sit down with a few friends over some beers and have a good laugh at this.  Although, the fact that children get nibbled on is somewhat foul play in my opinion.  Any head to head caparison with the Jaws movies is unnecessary.  For one thing, this movie does not take itself anywhere near as seriously as Jaws.  The production values are much lower and the budget was obviously far more constrained.  However the acting is spirited and key actor Branford Dillman is a poor man's Burt Reynolds on steroids - escaping from small town cops and turning on a ""dukes of hazard"" style driving display.  This is all good fun and looking at many of today's movies there should be more of it.  The movie has plenty of shots of half eaten people and bodyparts flashing past the lens, but nothing substantial enough to be considered high on gore.  The suspense has been all but removed with the passage of time and you tend to look forward to the next attack as a highlight of the movie anyway.  Nudity consists of a pair of breasts in the opening scene so nothing to get too excited about on that front either.

1049427,3,6305596247,"Piranha (Joe Dante, 1978)

Okay, so here are three names for you.

Roger Corman, legendary producer of bad low-budget horror movies.

John Sayles, America's best-loved unknown scriptwriter.

Joe Dante, director of some of the best-loved films of the 1980s.

What do these three people have in common? Piranha.

Corman was, of course, already a household name in 1978, having already produced well over a hundred films by that time (he has since tripled that number), including Death Race 2000 (starring a then up-and-coming young actor named Sylvester Stallone), Caged Heat (which sparked the women-in-prison exploitation genre), and Dementia 13 (for which he conscripted a young director named Francis Ford Coppola, giving him his first directorial credit). Sayles was selling his first screenplay, and Dante was directing his third film. Both were still a few years away from gaining the stardom they found in the eighties (Sayles went on to something akin to stardom after rewriting this script for Alligator, and Dante achieved megastar status when he teamed up with Sayles and Corman-- this time, as an actor-- again for The Howling).

Do you really need a plot synopsis? Maggie McKeown (Heather Minzies, best known for The Sound of Music) is a skip tracer sent to look for a couple of teenagers who've disappeared. While looking for them, she hooks up with Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman, just off The Swarm), and the two of them discover an abandoned government base where Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy, still going strong at almost ninety years old; he most recently appeared in Looney Tunes: Back in Action) has been genetically mutating a school of piranha, whom Maggie accidentally lets out into the nearby river. Complications, as they say, ensue.

To sit here and call Piranha great cinema would utterly destroy what little cred, if any, I've managed to gain during my reviewing career. It's an awful movie, with the trademark Corman special effects (the swarming piranha are depicted by what look like cardboard cutouts), terrible acting, and a plot that's held together with spit, chewing gum, and every monster movie clich known to mankind. Absolutely horrid. That said, you can't help but love it. Much of the film's cult quality comes from watching veteran actors turn in horrid performances (there's even a urn by the legendary Barbara Steele as a government scientist struggling to cover the story up). Sayles' script is often hysterical, as many of his early scripts were, and Date's direction is the essence of frenetic. This is bad cinema the way bad cinema is supposed to be. It's Jaws on a really bad acid trip. See it and marvel at how engaging truly stupid cinema can be. *** ",1112572800,,2697,5.0291479820627805

1049430,4,6305596247,"This is a silly, fun, extravagant rubber fish nibbling on campers type movie produced by the legend himself, Roger Corman (actually he is credited as an executive producer) and directed by Joe Dante. Of course the entire movie is nothing but an underfunded version of ""Jaws"" for the tropical fish enthusiast, and as such has every major subplot you would expect. My favorite is the attempt to close down the resort where the fish were headed and the chaos that ensues (particularly relishing the line ""The piranhas are eating the guests, sir"" spoken by a dutiful underling.)

The film stars Bradford Dillman (who?) and cute Heather Menzies who you may have caught in ""The Sound of Music"" (!) with special and amusing guest appearances by Keenan Wynn, Paul Bartel, and Barbara Steele. The acting isn't bad given the level of the script, but I do find the whole scenario in which Dillman and Menzies are thrown together (was it fate?) a bit ridiculous, and I find the resolution of their relationship at the end of the film unfulfilling: it's like the director ran out of film and just tacked ""The End"" on the last frame.

The plot is fairly entertaining in the silly, eye-rolling way of Corman films: crazy scientist with mutant fish (evil Army programs and toxic waste plays a part, of course), a very contrived release of said fish into a stream which cohabitates with a major Arkansas summer camp and resort. Lots of rubber fish take up the rest of the movie, creating pandemonium wherever they go. (I wonder if this was the future home of the ""Whitewater"" development.)

Interestingly for a DVD like this, it has a lot of extras. It has the original trailer, cast biographies, preview attractions, and a ""Making of Piranha"" feature, in which the fish look even sillier than in the film itself, and finally a short of bloopers.

Sure it's a rip-off of ""Jaws"", sure it's stupid, sure the fish look ludicrous, but that's where the fun starts: it's a Corman picture, after all. Sit back and enjoy. Not the cream of the B-movie crop, but mindlessly enjoyable, nonetheless. I recommend it to B-movie fans with a score of four stars.",1097366400,2,2129,4.745945945945946
1049431,4,6305596247,"As far as 80's horror sci-fi, I can't recommend much better.  This movie has a pretty predictable, though well paced plot left over from the 50's, updated for the 80's.  Scientist creates a species of super piranha, funded by the military, and they escape into a North American river system.  The special effects range from okay (the underwater scenes of the school of piranha moving by) to the exquisitely grotesque (close-ups of the piranha feasting on human flesh while victims scream and flail hopelessly).  It is at times an edge of the seat thriller.  This early film of Joe Dante (The Howling and Gremlins and Gremlins 2) is cut and paced perfectly for the scares and thrill ride it offers.  Bradford Dillman makes a strong, believable hero, and Heather Menzies a tough and resourceful leading lady.  There are some wonderful appearances by Roger Corman favorites Barbara Steele and Dick Miller, and a standout performance by Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) as the ""mad scientist"" who has a heart in the end.

The Special Features includes a commentary by director Joe Dante and producer Jon Davison.  I was not sure how to take their comments, as at times they seemed humble and appreciative of the experience, and at other times seemed embarrassed by this early B-grade production.  And yet, it all seems pretty laid-back and fun, and in the end they both seemd to appreciate what they had accomplished.  I found myself laughing outloud at the circumstances they found themselves in while trying to put this complicated production together, both novices in movie-making.  In any case, I love the movie, and I'm very glad they made it.  If your hesitant to buy the dvd because you think of it as an obvious rip-off of ""Jaws"", you are absolutely correct; it was.  However, the film is also a homage to ""Jaws"" as is evident right from the first scene, when leading lady Heather Menzies is playing an early primitive computer game called, what else, ""Jaws"".

1049433,4,6305596247,"Jaws (1975) frightened a whole generation of people out of the water.  Why?  Because of the very real elements within the film, being that there are sharks in the oceans, and occasionally they do attack people.  Do they ever get as large as the one in the film?  Possibly...regardless, the fear was real enough...fast forward to 1978...prolific B movie director/producer Roger Corman, in an effort to capitalize on the immense popularity of the film Jaws, released Piranha, directed by Joe Dante (Gremlins, Innerspace, The `burbs) and written by John Sayles (The Howling, Wild Thing), which, while didn't elicit the response anywhere near that of the film it borrows from, still provides us with a great deal of entertainment (genetically altered super fish just didn't come across with the same level of realism as a giant man-eating shark).
The film stars Branford Dillman, who, along with his extensive television credits, appeared in scores of films like Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) and The Swarm (1978), to name a couple.  Also starring is Heather Menzies, who appeared in films like The Sound of Music (1965), SSSSSSS (1973), along with various television shows throughout the 70's.  Rounding out the cast are Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Paul Bartel, Barbara Steele (Caged Heat and Shivers), Melody Thomas Scott, and character actors Dick Miller and Keenan Wynn.
The film opens at night with two victims, er...I mean backpackers in a hilly area (somewhere in Texas, as we find out later), who happen to come across a seemingly deserted facility surrounded by a large fence, and signage stating `Military Testing Facility' and `Keep Out' (it seemed pretty clear to me, as I could read it, but these two knuckleheads completely missed it, bringing to mind the old adage, `if it was a snake, it would have bit you').  Anyway, lunkhead number one and lunkhead number two, looking for a place to camp for the night, decide this looks promising, and make their way past the fence to find a large, in-ground cement pool.  Do you think it contains piranha?  And do you also think said piranha are hungry?  I do, on both counts, especially given that it's the title of the film.  Anyway, they decide to go swimming and quickly discover the pool contains more than water.  We also learn the facility isn't entirely deserted...
Apparently someone cares about these two now missing backpackers, enough so to hire private investigator Maggie McKeown (Menzies) to look for them.  While initiating her search in the general area, she find a shack occupied by Paul Grogan (Dillman), a divorced, reclusive, mass alcohol consuming (every five minutes he's swilling from a canteen, but never actually seems to get drunk) outdoorsman type, who she basically enlists to aid her, despite his protests, in her search.  They find the deserted military facility, which was once some sort of breeding farm for fish, and decide to drain the large pool in hopes of finding clues.  As they throw the switch, they get attacked by a wily old man (his name is Dr. Robert Hoak, played by McCarthy) as he freaks out learning that the fish have been released into the river system.  The manage to subdue him, and he speaks of his experiments, specifically his genetic experiments for the military in creating a super breed of piranha, meant for use during the Vietnam conflict, but since the war ended, the program was terminated, but apparently no one told Dr. Hoak.  So now the highly aggressive and carnivorous super fish are in the local river system.  And they're hungry...and breeding...
For a B movie, this tends to one of the better ones I've seen.  Even here you can see that Dante has talent in directing, despite what I am sure was probably an extremely tight shooting schedule (Corman always kept this aspect tight).  Sayles provides a better than average script for this type of outing, and the actors present enjoyable performances.  I do tire of the whole `government and/or big business conspiracy' clich that is so often used in films of any type to move the plot along, as it tends to indicate a lack of imagination (just look at some Steven Segal movies, specifically On Deadly Ground (1994) and The Patriot (1998), for a couple of examples).  I especially liked the scenes with Keenan Wynn speaking of how much the river gives him, and also the scenes with Dick Miller, who plays the sleazy real estate agent and proprietor of Aquarena, an entertainment water park that recently opened along the river.  He's got one of the more memorable scenes in the film when his assistant approaches him about piranha in the waters, and he asks, ""What about the godd@mn piranha?!"", to which the assistant replies, ""The piranha...they're EATING the guests, sir"".  Paul Bartel also makes a great appearance as an uptight director of a summer camp located on the river (do you think a big part of their program involves swimming?).  The special effects are quite good (no CGI work here) and there is a good helping of blood and underwater scenes with the fish tearing flesh off hapless victims.
Presented here is an excellent looking full screen print (Dante claims this is the original aspect ratio of the film, but the titles appear to be in wide screen format).  Special features here are copious, including a commentary track by director Dante and producer Jon Davidson, original theatrical trailer, a blooper reel, a short `Making of' documentary, cast biographies, a reproduction of the original Theatrical Marketing Guide, an eight page booklet titled `The History of Roger Corman, and trailers for some of Corman's other films including Grand Theft Auto (1977) and Humanoids from the Deep (1980), among others.  If I learned anything from Piranha, it's that if you are warn authorities about mutant piranha loose in a populated waterway, you're better off crying toxic waste, as they not apt to believe the piranha thing.

1049434,4,6305596247,"As a kid growing up on all the classic monster films on TV, this low-budget Roger Corman creature feature was always one of my favorites. As a teenage video collector in the 90's, I found this to be nearly impossible to find on VHS. Now as an adult in my early 20's, I own not only the video but have recently picked up the DVD and what a trip down memory lane, this ""special edition"" was for me.
""Piranha"" is Corman's answer to ""Jaws"", a bad genre film that takes joy in being a bad genre film. When a private investigator goes looking for two missing kids at an old army test, she unwittingly releases a school of mutated killer piranha into the town's river system. With the help of a local mountain man, the two try to warn everyone from the military to a local resort. As is always the case in these films, the military has another agenda and they don't want the truth revealed.
Over the years, ""Piranha"" has earned a reputation as a true cult classic. With a great script from John Sayles, an amazing musical score from Pino Donaggio, and tremendous performances from underrated actors like Dick Miller, Keenan Wynn, Paul Bartel, and horror legend Barbara Steele, ""Piranha"" is the ultimate ""nature goes wrong"" B-movie.
My only real complaint about this DVD is that it is presented in a full-frame format (though the opening credits are finally presented in widescreen as the other way cuts the names pretty badly). Well, that and the fact that they didn't include any of the added footage from the original network TV version. Those complaints aside, it is good to hear director Joe Dante (who went on to direct ""Gremlins"") and producer Jon Davison reminisicing on the filming of this movie. Not to mention, the added value of seeing lots of never-before-seen footage from the making of the film. If you loved this movie growing up or are just a fan of the classic ""creature feature"" titles, this is a must-have.",1076112000,5,1918,4.611111111111111
1049435,4,6305596247,"First I read the book.  Then I saw the video.  Now I have the DVD.  Why?  Because this is an above average B-movie.
A military lab is the home of deadly and intelligent piranha.  But when a tracker releases them into the Lost River, the waters run red.
Downstream from the river are an old man, a dam, a summer camp, a new resort and the ocean.  The hungry fish are making their through each of these and if they reach the end they can terrorize the country.
One of the nice things about this film is the way people show remorse when their bad decisions/greed/arrogance lead to death by fish.  This is true except for the hero who released the fish in the first place.  I could really see the military spinning the ball into her court and making her take the blame for the whole fiasco (but it doesn't happen, she just goes about her way).
The other problem involves geography.  The new dam has created Lost River Lake, said to be the site of the resort.  But the resort is downstream from the lake (which looks no wider than the river) and there is another stream that bypasses the dam but doesn't have an increased flow from the now deeper river.
While I think the hero should have shown some acknowledgment of her part in the horror, her involvement is eclipsed by the evil Barbara Steele.  With more obvious villains to hate many viewers miss the true culprit.
Fun and well done.  Even the effects are pretty good.  You may not look at rivers the same way again.",1075420800,,1466,4.365313653136531

7891715,4,6305596247,"It has been a long time since I saw this movie on TV (naturally, the opening swim shot was cut) and much longer since it first came out.  The opening scene is a homage to Jaws.  There are a lot of extras on this DVD, but you still know you are watching a low budget B-movie.  There are mismatches with the audio, and a couple of glitches.  But then, it was not as if this film was preserved for posterity once it was made, so one has to be thankful they got what they got.  The audio commentary will make it clear just what low budget means in trying to make a film. One of my memories of this movie were the sounds they used to indicate the swarming piranhas, and there is a lot of attacking, which is what the movie goer paid money to see.  Often B-movies are simply duds.  But Piranha is a home run.  It is a lot of fun to watch.

I am not going to go into the plot or the acting, as others can do that.  It simply is a lot of movie for the money they had available.  And they made it fun to watch.  There is a reason this film is considered a classic.

When this movie was released, there was a newspaper strike on the East Coast, so there are actually few written reviews of the movie when it came out.",1519948800,,1207,3.95850622406639
