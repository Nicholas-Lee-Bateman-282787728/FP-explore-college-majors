Good:
Her instruction is fresh and truly excellent for improving yoga postures.
The asanas (poses) which comprise her routines are also out-of-the ordinary.
The voice over is clear (tho' with some accent) and sufficiently loud.
Between routines there is a nice pause with natural scenery and music...about 3 minutes each.
Not so great:
Visibility to her poses is compromised by the angle of take, the poor lighting on the set (she's under a canopy with bright sunshine behind) and the video editor faded the corners for a groovy effect...but not so great for instruction as visibility to her poses is compromised!
the 3rd and final routine consists of down dog between each and every pose as transition, which I find tiring. Sometimes down dog makes an EXCELLENT transition...but here it seems unimaginative.
The 3rd routine also has some poses which are beyond intermediate, in my opinion. And, she doesn't provide any eases into the pose, any mods, nor does she name the pose so one could look it up, and get a bit of extra 'how to' online.

Overall, a strong B from me - a finicky reviewer.",1407542400,2,1204,4.760765550239235
