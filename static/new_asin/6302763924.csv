The ending was reshot because of some odd PC concerns of that period in time (I won't say what, you can check out the IMDB website to read about it).

509697,2,6302763924,"The Mole People, 1956 film

It begins with a talk by a Professor about the exploration of a subterranean world. Are there beings there? He says the movie is a fable about society.

The story starts in Asia. Explorers find a stone tablet with cuneiform writing, at least 5,000 years old. Is there a curse on anyone who removes it? There is an earthquake! A young boy found an item high in the hills. It tells about an ancient people who lived on a mountain top. The explorers will go there. They climb on snow and ice to the plateau. There is wind and storm at night. There is danger from an avalanche! They take refuge in a cave, then see a stone arm! They find the ruins of a Sumerian temple. Where are the other buildings? They find a stone arm. Then the ground opens up and a man falls into this hole! Others climb down to follow him. Its warmer inside. I found him! Then rocks fall, are they trapped? They find tunnels and buildings. The explorers lay down for a rest. [No sentry?] Suddenly creatures put a hood on their heads and take them away! They find skeletons.

Two armed men appear and lead them away to an assembly. The king sentences them to death! But they escape, a light drives away their captors. They find other creatures! Their light makes them appear as messengers from Ishtar. They learn about their culture and population control! The High Priest wants these messengers followed to learn the secret of the light. The mole people are harshly treated and forced to work for their masters. There is a dance by a lightly clad woman for entertainment. Then three women disrobe as they step into a fiery room! Afterwards their charred remains are carried away! The explorers are attacked, the High Priest gets their light! But the mole people enter the palace and attack the nobles! Sunlight drives them all away. Its deadly to the underground creatures. The two explorers and that blonde escape to the real world. But shaking ground causes an accident. Adel does not survive.

This is a slow-moving drama. It shows a society where a few profit from dominating the many in the lower classes. What if they revolt? Can their society continue to exist? What would replace it? Its funny to think of an ancient Sumerian people from thousands of years ago that speaks modern American English! Living underground should result in a lack of vitamin D and result in medical problems. Can humans exist on a diet of mushrooms? Not to my knowledge. Maybe a lack of essential nutrients?

In the world of intelligence a mole is an enemy agent planted deep underground who acts as a spy but may only be active sporadically. Was that arrowhead used for StarTrek?",1449964800,,2663,4.597894736842106

Archaeologist Dr. Roger Bentley (John Agar) and his colleagues find evidence of a dynasty that fell off the face of the earth. The amount of expedition to discover what they can of this lost civilization on the top of the mountain. They may find more than they bargained for.

This is not one of William Alland's (producer) best films and John Agar tried to keep a straight face. The writer was Lazlo Gorog.
Make-up by Bud Westmore; he was a big dude in the industry of the time. He did 559 movies, many of which you would be surprised.

509783,4,6302763924,"Some of the great sci-fi tackles contemporary or other relevant topics.  ""The Mole People"" may not be fantastic sci-fi but it is a solid B&W that will leave indelible memories with the viewer such as when the mole men are whipped and shriek and shrink back from their masters and sink into the sands of the subterranean earth and the lost in time civilization that the main character's party discovers and must escape before it falls to its ultimate destruction.  A stalwart of 1950s sci-fi, John Agar stars in this actioner and, with the help of the mole people as they turn more menacing, escapes with the surviving members of his party and frees a female slave (I think) from an oppressive ancient sun-worshipping civilization that still sacrifices its female members to appease their god.  There is some subtext about slaves and societal castes that can be good fodder for conversations; is okay to treat and abuse people in a way that benefits you because they're different (the mole men here are readily identifiable with any slave caste, including America's ugly history with African men and women); is it okay to sacrifice people because they may keep you alive?  This actioner has its own ideas about these topics and it's not going to be overly serious about them because that is not its concern but the subtext lends a lot of weight to what would otherwise be a fairly typical sci-fi yarn.

For me?  This movie left its marks and will always be beloved.  You can get this movie, along with a slew of other fine sci-fi (mostly monster) fare, at a great price by purchasing ""The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection"" right here on Amazon for about $35.

509785,4,6302763924,"The tape was in okay condition, the outside cover a little worn. The tape played well,however, and my husband and I enjoyed the old ""sci-fi"" movie!",1325462400,,147,4.6923076923076925
509786,4,6302763924,"One of the advantages of being an old fart is that you can look at old movies with an unjaudiced eye. You can appreciate them for what they were/are instead of getting overly concerned about whether or not the special effects are ""believable"" or whether you can see the zippers in the monster's costume or whether the acting is Oscar worthy or not. In short, you can just watch the movie and have a good time. I've always had a good time with the old movies from the 1950's, and one of the flicks I've enjoyed consistently is THE MOLE PEOPLE.

Now possibly one of the reasons I got an extra kick out of the movie was that it was the first horror film I saw after learning about the Catholic Church's list of condemned films.  MOLE PEOPLE was on that list, and even though our family wasn't comprised of very many practicing Catholics, it did give the film a certain special appeal. You know what I mean? I just had to see whatever it was they didn't want me to see!

Of course since I was only about 9 at the time I wasn't expecting anything in particular so I wasn't disappointed. A little mystified maybe, but not disappointed. It had everything I could ask for: archaeologists hunting for lost peoples, weird looking monsters who knew the value of friendship, a lost civilzation that worshipped a strange God (which might have been what had the Church freaked out in retrospect), and the inevitable earthquake that screws everything up.

Frank Baxter, who hosted a well-known educational tv series, does the film's intro to give the story some added creedence. Hugh Beaumont (from LEAVE IT TO BEAVER) stars as an archaeologist, John Agar is our square jawed leading man, Alan Napier is the High Priest of the lost civilzation the explorers discover, and Cynthia Nixon is the cursed girl with whom Agar falls in love.

Yes sir, a perfect movie going experience then and now. What a shame the MST3K people will never be able to appreciate it.",1213315200,20,1943,4.587896253602305
509852,4,6302763924,"I love these old monster films and I know my rating is higher than the film deserves.

509853,2,6302763924,"The Mole People is one of those old sci-fi/horror movies that are fun to watch because of their ineptitude. MST3K did a good job with this particular roll of film when they were on the air. A group of archaeologists accidentally discover a race of people living underground. These people can't stand the light and when they see the scientist's flashlight they believe them to be Gods because they carry light in their cylinder. Only the high priest believes them to be mortal and he spends the movie trying to prove it to his king. The humans try to find a way out of the Mole People kingdom and cause a rebellion among a group of creatures they have enslaved to do their labor. It's all done very badly and with no action or suspense whatsoever. The script is stretched tight to make a full movie out of a twenty minute plot. The Mole People is not a well made movie, but can be fun to watch nonetheless.",1168992000,2,905,4.392857142857143
509854,4,6302763924,"I love it when I hear the ""culture set"" say they saw films like this on MSTK3000, because that means they never really watched it for the entertainment value it originally had.  When I was a kid I caught this on the Saturday Afternoon Movie, and I was enraptured.  An ancient civilization of albino fanatics worshipping Ishtar, and it was frankly frightening to a nine year old boy - Mole People that dragged the heros into the ground and killed with long sharp clawed hands, human sacrifices, dark frightening caverns under the earth, and giant dead cities.  Yes, the science is hokey - and at times the production crew got the historical facts dead wrong - but John Agar is a solid sci-fi hero and it was nice to see Hugh Beumont in a role other than Leave It To Beaver, and the rest of the cast does a very good job of keeping the story moving (Alan Napier is great as the evil head of the religious sect). For a B picture, the special effects were well done. There is a constant feeling of gloom and impending doom - or at least as much as Holliwood allowed in their 50's sci-fi movies. And it's interesting to note that the rumor is the original ending was supposed to be a happy ending, until the studio apparently was afraid that Adal and Roger living happily ever after would be considered inter-racial marriage.  Too bad.  I wish they'd release it with the happy ending, because every time I watch this movie I want a happy ending.  I've introduced this film to my ten year old daughter, and like myself all that time ago, she was facinated by the adventure story.

I for one am glad this has been release on DVD finally (in Universal's The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection box set), as it's one of my favorite movies from a time period when you could still believe in a civilization lost beneath the crust of the earth.  For the MSTK3000 crowd, if you want a really well-made, frightening sci-fi movie made today about the same subject, go see ""Descent"".  It's the modern, darker version of ""The Mole People"", and it will satisfy your darker needs.  But as a dad, I'm hoping my daughter won't feel the need to see a movie like that for a long time.",1158969600,10,2160,4.445569620253164
509855,4,6302763924,"If this movie isn't on DVD, what a shame!  Freaking Bela Legosi's Devil Bat is on DVD and that's a FAR worse film than this.

Before the actual start of The Mole People, a bald English professor tells us about myths, legends, and theories involving what may lie underneath the surface of the globe.  Not one of them is even close to being plausible.

After the opening credits we find out the movie takes place in Asia.  That's helpful.  We see John Agar, Hugh Beaumont, and an old guy who's always in the way go on an archaeological expedition up a darn high mountain.  Of course, a few expendable extras tags along, and one of them falls down a deep hole when the mountain's summit is reached.  The whole expedition climbs down the hole in a lengthy rope descending scene, and the extra is found dead of course.  Another extra makes the mistake of hammering a peg in the wrong place during the decent, and gets killed in an avalanche, which traps John Agar's and crew hundreds of feet below the surface.  Man, two extras killed in 15 minutes.  What a downer.

At this point, the movie really gets going.  A pale-skinned race of people capture the Agar crew.  Why, these must be the mole people!!  Actually, they're not.  Instead, they're the people who have enslaved the mole people, and they whip the poor ugly mole-folk day and night.

The movie's science gets pretty bad here, and we find out that the pale-skinned albinos have a tan person born among them every now and then.  John Agar falls in love with the tan chick, because she's hot of course.  Hugh Beaumont and the rest of the clue seem to accept this.

Agar's crew manages to avoid getting killed by the albinos with the clever use of a god-like flashlight, and a few of the mole people are freed in the process.

In the end, the old guy dies, Agar's girlfriend dies, the albinos die, and the mole people die.  Man.  Makes you think doesn't it?

The MST3K version of this movie is unbeatable.  Funniest thing ever.  However, the movie on its own is silly enough to provide a few good laughs, so don't feel bad if you can't find a way to see the MST3K version.  I highly recommend that everybody see this movie in some form or fashion at least once.  It accidentally addresses some interesting cultural issues as it goes through its approximately 90 minute flop around.  It also has some human sacrifice scenes and plenty of mole-whipping if you're into that.

I particularly like the mole peoples' costumes.  They're not very scary, and almost cute in an ugly sort of way.",1157932800,5,2537,4.522026431718062
