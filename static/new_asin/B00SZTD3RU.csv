6998296,4,B00SZTD3RU,"Ok, its not typical, but it is worth the watch.  The concept is Anime, Vice City and Sin City, the story line is very Sin City and Animation is closer to a video game than a real cartoon.  It is very bloody and fast paced.  If I could sum it up it's like a Mickey Splane  pulp fiction thing.",1426204800,,291,3.8813559322033897
6998297,1,B00SZTD3RU,"I had a problem getting past the racist elements. Boogie said, ""I belong to the largest racist community, the one that hates the poor"", problem with this statement is that every character portrayed as poor was black characters drawn in the typical stereotype way (big lips). If you are into that type of thing this movie is for you. However, if you are not into racist cinema, don't offend yourself by being an audience to this racist mess.",1426118400,4,440,4.653846153846154
6998298,2,B00SZTD3RU,"It's basically every American action film you've seen through foreign filter. The dubbing isn't very good, the story is thin, and a lot the jokes don't work so well. With just a little polish this could be a good farce, as it stands this has all the feel of a student film or amateur film circuit project.",1426032000,,305,4.368421052631579
6998299,2,B00SZTD3RU,"Trope-ridden, Google-translated, flash animated attempt at film noir via Looney Tunes and Sam Peckinpah--and not in a way that could be described as good.  In all fairness I'm not sure how much of the script was lost in translation (the movie was originally made in Argentina,) being dubbed into English without the apparent participation of anyone who speaks the latter with a high level of fluency did it no favors.  The movie is overly long, and reeks like a student film (which it could very well be) knockoff of Sin City without being as interesting.

Of the many cheesy movies available via Amazon, this one was very much unworthy of my time.",1425254400,3,648,4.767857142857143

6998305,1,B00SZTD3RU,"This movie has the animation going for it but that is about it. The first thing I noticed was that English voice actors are definitely not native American English speakers, which makes it hard to get into the story. But that is nothing compared to the fact that I noticed a distinct racism after Boogie abused two separate black street children, both characterized by the same juvenile voice, oversized lips and an exaggerated navet. The first of these children, Boogie offers a paying gig and then tells the boy to kick open a door leading to a room of bad guys, which leads to the boy's death, to which Boogie makes a quip about why he bothers trying to find employment for the needy. The second time a boy with with these characteristics makes an appearance, he approaches asking for a free hamburger and Boogie sticks a mustard squeeze bottle in his mouth and squeezes, following it with a line about something to the effect that they don't deserve to exist.  I stopped watching this movie because of this.",1514332800,,1010,4.64245810055866

6998308,1,B00SZTD3RU,"I don't normally bother reviewing films, but I made an exception. I love old 80s and 90s action movies and this seemed like it might but similar to Sin City. Sadly this was just flagrantly crude and openly misogynistic, which is a critique I'm sure has been leveled against many action movies, but this was on a different order of magnitude as it strode in a self-conscious sort of way to offer something more. As a cultural commentary, it highlights and brings out all the antisocial and misogynist elements of masculine, but as far as I can tell it doesn't do much more than glorify them. I gave it a half hour and gave up after I didn't find any of the promised irony. Terrible humans being terrible humans is not ironic.",1507766400,,724,4.492424242424242

6998313,2,B00SZTD3RU,"I clicked play, despite all the warnings about racism and so on, so I'm not accounting for any of that.

I gave this 12 minutes, a solid 16.4% of the run-time.  Or, I guess I gave up at 12 minutes.  Take it however you like...

This is flat out terrible, but also somewhat hard to explain.  I found some redeeming qualities to the landscape presentation, but the rest of the art seemed like it couldn't be arsed-  the cigarette floating in midair kept getting me.  If you aren't instantly enraged by the stuff that set off most of the other reviewers, I can promise that even if you keep going, Boogie's tempo is slow, monotonous, and lacking direction.  The voice acting is all read straight toned, possibly on a significant number of downers.  Don't expect to understand why anything happens, at least for the first 12 minutes.

Maybe you'll have better luck, but instead, maybe go watch some paint dry.  It'll be more exciting.",1503187200,5,930,4.609756097560975
6998314,1,B00SZTD3RU,I only got two minutes in.  Extremely racist and offensive.  I'm not a stranger to edgy or weird.  This was unacceptable to me.,1499126400,3,127,4.434782608695652
6998315,1,B00SZTD3RU,"So first my visceral emotional reaction:
NO NO NO...Gross and terrible!!!!!
There is something SERIOUSLY is wrong with anyone involved in the making of this ""movie""
It is a floating turd that should not be viewed by anyone; and if I cold gouge out the part of my brain that contained the memories of this idiocy, I gladly would.

Now to an explanation of why I feel that way...
Hack writing, Hack, animation, awful voice over work... they could pretty much not have done worse on any front.
I found the child murder scene particularly awful.
This movie is not funny; it IS racist and misogynistic.....and not in a lambasting feminism, sexuality, racial stereotypes and society kind of way; but in a horrible gross Deep South KuKluxClan Rapist kinda way.
To boot, it's just plain bad.
Despite it's very obvious effort to be cool,edgy and provocative; it just comes off as Boring but still offensive and kinda sad  (like a child repeating a racist epitaph).
It is without merit, even as an example of what not to do or what racism looks like and how theses attitudes affect society at large.
The posted positive reviews are clearly fraudulent reviews to boost ratings, purchase, and views or  they're written by an out and out sociopaths and pathological narcissist.
Either way... shame on the person who wrote this and produced this crap and I'm kinda annoyed with Amazon for allowing such absolutely awful content that lacks any redeeming qualities.
I feel bad for anyone who had to share the experience of watching this movie.
If you haven't viewed yet... Please do yourself a favor, take my advice and watch pretty much anything else....",1498521600,5,1639,4.825622775800712

6998452,5,B00SZTD3RU,"If you are over 18 and love strange violent cartoons you will like Boogie. It's that simple.
This is a terrible movie about a jaded husk of a man who behaves horribly and almost makes me re-think my anti-capital punishment stance.  But as a dark nihilistic cartoon it just works-Boogie is the bad guy that takes out worse guys, except in Boogie's case he just really doesn't care who he takes out and is happy to lure street youth to a quick death or a glass-eyed patron to a beating that keeps a team of surgeons occupied for hours. The terrible voice-over work also works on this stark and dismal plane of hyper-violence as art and the mish-mash of animation styles serves to illuminate how prevalent these terrible tropes are within modern pop offerings.
DECIDEDLY NOT family friendly, not for children, or people who excessively worry about children-but in every other regard a true classic that can be watched over and over again. To call the treatment of female characters misogynist doesn't go far enough by half-or a third or even a 10 millionth.  There are no real people here to try to treat well. Caricatures of failed homunculi occupy the screen just to die with hardly any purpose or edification. And then in the rain of misanthropy a drop or a millisecond of sentimentality-at least enough in order to snuff the life of the guy dying from a sucking chest wound-just wasting a bullet on a kindness for a forgone conclusion.
With all the foregoing in mind it is just demented fun. It doesn't bother trying to be shocing, it just merrily murders long through remarkably able and clean animation through a sophisticated plot of will the heartless mercenary side with one useless waste of human life or another angle of anthropomorphous sewer-surprisingly the will-he-or-won't he that hovers over the third reel is utterly at odds with the chaotic wave of destruction we can only know as Boogie.",1463270400,11,1904,4.78419452887538
6998453,1,B00SZTD3RU,"its bad. I really am just baffled and confused about this movie. If movies are a way for us to explore the realization of integrity between our inner selves and the world, then this must have been created by an individual who has a profoundly poor grasp of humanity, himself, and just reality in general.

But,
I don't know... some people liked it. Some people gave it 5 stars. it wasn't all bad, was it? I just don't know what to think. For this to exist, and to have any success at all is just making me question how much I even understand about the world and people in it.

Maybe its a really good movie and the genius behind it is that by the end of it I realized maybe I too was a ""lost and battered woman"" attracted to the ""boogie"" of cinematic wholeness. Holding on to my need for the movie to take a turn for the better, to see it through until a time when reality might finally match my deranged beliefs about the paradigm of our relationship, finally validating the self loathing which defines my continued pattern of self destructive relationship. In the end, it truly could only go two ways: 1 complete denial and loss of freedom in which my family and friends watch in horror and disbelief as I desperately defend my abuser (the movie) and my identity is forever consumed by the falsehood of ""his"" quality. Or, 2 a spiral of escalating trauma and despair, concealed by guilt and denial, which at last is miraculously ended by a final climax in which the viewer is forced into a life changing decision between an experience which no longer has even a shred of hope or pleasure, and another unknown world in which I may someday be able to experience joy and peace at the expense of deep vulnerability and the loss of my previously treasured yet no longer viable pattern of behavior.

I think.. maybe I just need to take a break from men, I mean... movies, for awhile. I'm going to go sit in the dark now.",1463184000,2,1915,4.3887323943661976

6998581,2,B00SZTD3RU,"I'm sure that there are people out there who would adore this movie, but I'm not sure I'd want to know them.  The animation, while stylized, was seriously lacking in some fundamental ways, including gross abuse of perspective and gratuitous use of live images shoehorned into areas where they add no visual value.  Overall, the vibe that comes across is not one of stylized animated action movie, but angry art school project dragged out to 90min.

Why, you might ask, have I started this review with so much focus on the art?  Simple.  The story makes no attempt to stand up on its own.  All characters in the story are wholly unlikable, and make a concerted effort to prevent your forming any sort of connection with them.  Some might say that this was done to make a statement, or even draw a political allegory about materialism and the cheapening of life.  The problem with this argument, is that it's better communicated when you wouldn't rather have all the characters die in a fire 10min in.

Please note that I have given this movie 2 stars, not because it deserves the second one (it doesn't), but because I couldn't be bothered to make it past the first 20 minutes.  For all I know, the movie could flash scene to something awesome at 21min in and completely redeem itself.

8700000,5,B00SZTD3RU,"so id say its a good four star. haveta counter some of that random extreme negativity from others. it is dark. bloody. and racist. oh.. and sexist. and HILARIOUS in a dark vindictive kind of way.not as good as the comic (what film ever is), but pretty decent entertainment. i actually skipped the beginning before i realized i had read the comic years ago. so, maybe the first bit is bad. but it was def a god entertaining saturday night flick. do NOT watch with children. or Women. def more sexist than racist",1523750400,,510,4.494623655913978
8700001,5,B00SZTD3RU,"But I couldn't stop watching. I would expect most people to be extremely offend by this material, which oddly enough was part of my fascination with it. What puzzles me the most is how I can end up liking and rooting for a character that is evil in almost every way. I'm going to have to think deeply about just why I enjoyed this movie... the animation was quality, cinematography, directing, voice overs, pacing, everything was well done. You may not like the material but if you know anything about production quality, you have to admit it's well done.",1521417600,,555,4.616161616161616
8700002,1,B00SZTD3RU,"Really wish I would have checked the reviews first. Bad animation, bad voiceovers... and just plain racist. I struggled to get through the lame intro, but once I got passed that the theme of this crap started to unfold very quickly. Kind of surprised amazon would include this in their prime video. If I could give this no stars, I would.",1521331200,,338,4.557377049180328
8700003,1,B00SZTD3RU,"I rarely read reviews before I watch a movie. That was a mistake for this film.
This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a decade.
 Dialogue was terrible, voice overs were awful, and the animation was like a 13 year old did it.
The only redeeming quality of this movie is the background art was nice. I hope they got to do some other movie that wasn't garbage.
 I made it a full 8 minutes into the movie before I couldn't stand it anymore and had to turn it off.
 I just hope the producers don't receive any money for my watching that 8 minutes. In fact I feel that they should have to pay me for watching that much of it. This is a truly awful film. I wish there was a way to give negative star ratings. Id give it minus 5 stars.",1520726400,,741,3.9266666666666667
