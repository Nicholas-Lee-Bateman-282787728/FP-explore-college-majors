8064939,3,B0009PS2FG,"I am not sure if this problem is across the board, but my collection
featured an electronic sound problem on the episode ""The Big Pair"".
The sound is way out of sink. It is pretty hilarious though, as
little Beverly Washburn opens her mouth and Ben Alexander's voice comes out. LOL

8064941,3,B0009PS2FG,"I purchased this despite previous disasterous experiences with titles produced by Madacy. This one was a pleasant surprise: although the video quality ranged from fair to poor (which was expected), there are at least a couple of real gems in this collection.  The sole reason I decided to purchase this is the fact that it includes an adaptation of one of the ""Dragnet"" radio series' best, most dramatic episodes, "".22 Rifle for Christmas.""  This is almost as good as the original radio episode - it's really a punch to the solar plexus.  Another winner is ""The Big Cast"" (Madacy does strike again here, though - they have juxtaposed this episode with ""The Big Little Jesus"" on the menu page.  If you click on one episode, you will get the other).  ""The Big Cast"" is, literally, a three man play in which Friday and his partner coax and cajoal a confession from a young (and wonderful) Lee Marvin.  ""The Big Boys"" features a very young Leonard Nimoy.  Here is a list of the episodes (another warning: these are not presented in chronological order and there is a lot of crossover with other collections):

The Big Cast

The Big Hands

The Big Phone Call

The Big Trunk

The Big Little Jesus

The Big War

The Big Frame

The Big Frank

The Big False Make

The Big Break

The Big Betty

The Big Bar
