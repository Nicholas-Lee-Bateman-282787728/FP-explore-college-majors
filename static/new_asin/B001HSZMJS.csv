8326498,2,B001HSZMJS,"I bought both the video and the book. I thought if I got the book I definitly would need the video, as an already certified large animal massage practictioner I could have saved my money and skipped the dvd. It offers little more info than the book does. I had hoped that the video would go into more detail than the book and it is very general just as the book. This dvd is great if you have had little or no experience doing body work sessions on horses as it does do a good job explaining how to do an opening and and a closing. It doesn't however do a great job explaining the level of pressure or quickness in your hands to use. The main horse used on the video is extremely wiggly and a very distracting example, plus he doesn't show what true great releases look like because he is so wiggly. If you need a strong visual buy this video, but otherwise skip it and just get the book - it does an ample job as an introduction, but does miss details, for example it shows points on a meridian but doesn't say what they are for. I like the book very much and have used it a lot and it is well worth the money for a place to start. Acupressure on horses works fantastic, but there is another ""master"" of technique out there I would reccomend to buy his dvd instead.",1266969600,10,1266,4.129554655870446
