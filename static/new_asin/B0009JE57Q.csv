2294608,2,B0009JE57Q,"I don't think the writing or the timing of the jokes was great in this movie, but Michelle Trachtenberg does a wonderful job with her role.  I think the message the movie sends is that girls need positive female role models to encourage them to be strong, independent, and go for their dreams.  I liked the fact that both the moms were working and not freting over their husbands not being around.  I liked that the love story beween Michelle's charecter and that guy wasn't the focus of the movie, her ice skating career was the main focus!",1111536000,10,541,4.5
2294609,4,B0009JE57Q,"Both my daughter and I skate (seriously but not terribly seriously) so I probably have a slightly different perspective from the public at large..but here goes. This is a movie about two moms with regets about the path they each failed to follow and want a second chance at their dreams through their daughters. And each of the daughters accommodate them to a point. The story gets interesting when their paths intersect and the brainy physics star daughter wants to pursue skating glory while the other wishes to give up success in skating for academic pursuits. If you knew nothing about skating you could follow the laughs and pathos through to  the happy conclusion and probably only note with mild amusement the unreality of the academic daughter's  proclaimed poverty despite a rather beautifully appointed house complete with skating pond. On that level I enjoyed the movie and my daughter (7.5 years) thought it was ""the best"". However I do feel compelled to comment on the unreality of the portrayal of the skating world. Skating moms generally are a pretty altruistic bunch, volunteering loads of hours to skating clubs which provide kids the opportunity to learn and perform and, yes, compete. There's a lot of camaraderie and friendship among the moms and the kids and I have found everyone to be really supportive of each other. The idea that a mother or coach would threaten to call the police because someone was making a digital recording of their skater's triple whatever is nothing short of ludicrous. The incidence of ""head games"" or ""dirty tricks"" certainly does not occur with the frequency suggested in the movie and personally I have never seen or heard of it. My second issue is the silly suggestion that anyone could progress in the sport with the speed of the heroine. Ok, this is at the crux of the story and one has to suspend belief for this one, but just so you know, it generally takes at least 7-10 years of nearly daily practice (and ""raw talent"") to be doing good triples. Even if you also have studied physics.  My final issue is aesthetic. If you watch skating up close at a competition or exhibition, it looks so beautiful it really takes your breath away. The jumps and spins look amazing and often the choreography is such an extension of the music, that the artistry just transports the viewer. Not so in this movie. They are so busy editing the skating shots to make sure you can't tell when they're put in a ""skating double"" that the beauty of the skating experience is largely lost. Also I supect some digital enhancement of the speed of the spins--they just didn't look right-but that's a minor point. For a formula story about two moms and two daughters, Disney has done a decent job of giving a little extra in the character development department and there are enough laughs and pathos to make it well worth a trip to the theatre. But please believe that there is very little about skating in the movie which bears any resemblance to reality.",1111276800,4,2989,4.733205374280231

I am really curious about who her body double is?? And who they found to play skaters/be skaters in the movie. I know they were looking for girls with at least up to double axels that weren't ""serious"" skaters. Plus Michelle Kwan is in this movie!! Extra star for no tara lipinski!!

2294630,4,B0009JE57Q,"My granddaughters love this movie...one of them became a competitive figure skater, partly because of watching this movie. It has very good characterizations and themes and the actors do a very good job. However, there are a few quite ludicrous aspects. Most particularly, now that I know the world of figure skating, is the scene where Casey, along with the other members of the ""Snowplow Sam"" class do a recital where they ""qualify"" for various levels of USFS (U. S. Figure Skating). Casey qualifies as a junior competitor by doing one double jump and a couple of spins during the recital. One of the younger girls qualifies as novice by skating around in a circle with the other young kids. This is an enormous misrepresentation of the tremendous amount of work it actually takes to get to those levels. There are 8 levels in USFS, pre-preliminary, preliminary, pre-juvenile, juvenile, intermediate, novice, junior and senior, senior being the level that is shown on TV at national and international competitions, including the Olympics. At each level, the skater has to practice for weeks to months to learn the complicated moves that will allow them to pass the Moves in the Field test at that level. Then they must perform a program with certain spins and jumps for each level, spins and jumps that also take months to years to learn. Each level is more difficult than the one before. And they are progressive...you have to pass pre-preliminary moves in the field in order to take the pre-preliminary freestyle test. Then you have to pass the preliminary moves in the field test in order to take the preliminary freestyle test, etc. Each test takes months to learn and practice before they can be passed. And they also require extensive coaching by a private coach. My granddaughter has been skating for 6 years and is at the intermediate level, the fifth level, working on her novice moves in the field. So you can see how ridiculous it is that a 6-year-old in the movie passes novice level by skating around in a circle in a recital. The USFS testing is always done with one skater alone on the ice, being judged by three qualified judges. Each judge gives that skater marks for each element performed and scores them overall with a pass or a retry. If you don't pass, you have to practice again for weeks to months and pay for another test session before you can advance. In addition, each test has to be scheduled and paid for separately. And no recital ever has judges that can qualify the skaters for any USFS level. Obviously this is a Hollywood production and liberties are taken. It would be boring and slow down the pace of the movie to show all that. But showing years of work and increasingly difficult jumps, spins, tests telescoped into one recital is just wrong. I say all this to say that my granddaughter was greatly misled by watching this movie and had to learn the hard way what a huge amount of hard labor and commitment (and money) is involved in becoming a competitive figure skater and moving up the levels. Just FYI",1484265600,2,3046,4.705992509363296

2294640,5,B0009JE57Q,"I guess I'll always associate Michelle Trachtenberg best with her little sister role from Buffy. After that, it's probably Ice Princess that strikes a chord. She's really good as high school physics phenom Casey Carlyle. It's a 2005 Disney movie that is formulaic in plot but still very much watchable because of the performances and that same plot that refuses to stick to stereotypes. And that's what's called a dichotomy.

In Millbrook, Connecticut, Casey and her mom (Joan Cusack) had forever long dreamed of placing Casey in a prestigious college, and, specifically, Harvard. Having garnered eleven straight A+ grades in her science exams, Casey is advised by her teacher to come up with an original project so as to snag a physics scholarship. Now, our girl likes to mess around skating on that patchy ice pond by her house. One day, as she watches a figure skating competition on the telly, a wild notion pops into her head: Why not come up with an exact aerodynamic formula to assess and improve a figure skater's technique? There's her science project.

Casey gets permission to videotape, for research, the skaters in the local rink, most of whom are figure skaters training for an upcoming competition, some of whom are her school mates. I can mention that Casey's conclusion is that ""the kinetic energy in the jump equals half the skater's mass times velocity squared minus-"" and then her bemused best friend cuts her off to tell her that her video presentation comes off dry and clinical, that Casey needs to inject personal flavor, some passion. So it makes sense - doesn't it? - that Casey then begins to seriously take to the ice, herself now a subject. She's taking beginner's lessons. And as she goes on, is it that big a surprise that she falls in love with the sport?

Yep, it's an underdog sports story that delivers familiar beats. We get that slew of obligatory moments, none more clichd than the distraught athlete gazing up at the stands and seeing her estranged mom rooting her on. There's the hypercompetitive coach and the pushy parents and the gloating adversary. The actors who play the two main grown-ups are grand in this one. Joan Cusack is Casey's mom, a teacher of feminist lit at the local college and someone who herself never attended university and so is driven to get her academic badass of a daughter into a reputable college. Predictably, Casey's new passion doesn't exactly enthuse mom. She tells Casey, figure skaters have maybe eight years of professional competitiveness, and a few more tacked on touring with the All-Star Has-Beens on Ice. And her point: ""There's no shelf life on your mind."" Kim Cattrall is just as good as Casey's sort of skating mentor, Tina. But Kim's character is flawed and shady in ways that an actress could sink her teeth into. Tina Harwood was once an Olympic figure skating hopeful until a disqualification at Sarajevo - and the resulting banning - years ago put the skids on her dream. Tina operates the rink in which Casey does her research and later skates. Tina also coaches her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere). But she coaches like a martinet, and there's Gen chafing under her mom's iron fist.

Gen, she's my second favorite character, after Casey. The movie opens and we observe Gen being dismissive towards our shy science nerd, and we right away designate her as THE popular mean girl. I love that the movie goes against the grain regarding her arc. I would say Gen gets even more character development than Casey, and it's a rewarding journey as Gen rises above her label, as Gen wistfully opens up to Casey: ""I hate to train all the time. I'd love to have a real life, like you."" And as Gen finally calls out her mom: ""I'm fed up with being a dunce in math class because I don't have time to do the homework."" And maybe that's what I liked best about this movie, even more than Casey's triumphant sports moments. It has substance, some real things to say. I dig the personal interactions between Casey and Gen, between the moms and their daughters, and also the thorny interplay between the two moms. The dialogue comes off real and thoughtful and and sometimes hurtfully blunt. It sparks debate regarding sports and academia, tiger moms, and securing an education versus pursuing an outlandish dream.

Trachtenberg does everything right. She makes Casey such a rootable figure. It helps that the script treats her with respect. Casey is vulnerable and plucky. She's brainy and kind and poised yet doesn't know she's pretty. She loves her mom dearly but her newfound passion for something other than academia compels her to lie to her mom as she sneaks off to train. I am a manly man, yet I confess I used to watch figure skating - you can blame the scandal with Nancy Kerrigan and what's her face for drawing me in back in the '90s. I can say that Trachtenberg looks a natural on ice, although I'm pretty sure she wasn't the one performing those triple jumps. But the illusion convinces. The Cutting Edge will always be my favorite movie about figure skating. But Ice Princess is up there, as well.

For those deep into the sport, Brian Boitano and Michelle Kwan cameo as television commentators.

Also, Nikki the Jumping Shrimp is pretty awesome.

Not too many movies about figure skating. Here are the ones I'd seen and recommend:

It was well done and a good story line.  I also loved the Heroes series so I had to see it for that reason as well.. I could not go wrong..  You will enjoy it if you like those ""girl wants to be something other then she is and accidentally finds she's much better at something else.""  type movies",1434672000,,434,3.7888888888888888

2294693,4,B0009JE57Q,"No, Ice Princess was never a movie on my must see immediately list, but I always had it in the back of my mind as a movie I was interested in seeing.  After all, I am a fan of star Michelle Trachtenberg.  And, as much as Im not a sports fan, I am a sucker for the underdog sports story.  A lazy day and the movie on TV gave me a chance to watch it, and I enjoyed it.

Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a high school junior.  Shes super smart thanks to her mom Joan (Joan Cusack) pushing her.  But shes also obsessed with figure skating.  When shes given an assignment to create a physics project that could lead to a scholarship, she decides to do it on the physics involved in figure skating.

The more time she spends at the rink, the more Casey loves figure skating.  She even takes a job at the concession stand so she can start taking some classes herself and uses herself in her project.  And the more she does it, the more she finds she has a real talent for it.  Can she develop her skills enough to actually compete?

In some ways, this movie follows the typical sports movie formula, and the ending is fairly easy to see coming a ways away.  And yet in other ways, it is very different.  Part of that is because figure skating is an individual sport, and that is reflected in much of the story.  Casey is often on her own figuring out how she will pay for her lessons or convince her mom that this is a good thing.  Also, a character I had pegged as a Caseys main rival turned out to more friend then foe, although they had their moments.  Both of these were refreshing changes that I wasn't expecting.

Of course, I felt some of those relationships changed too much too quickly.  I understand the dramatic things they were trying to do, but it sometimes the transitions in her relationships felt too abrupt.  Still, I found that I was happy at the end by how things were wrapped up.

The actresses involved were coached on figure skating, and they did an amazing job with that aspect of things.  Okay, so Im sure that film editing helped, but I did believe what I saw on the screen.

Ive got no complaints in the acting department, either.  In fact, I was a bit surprised at some of the names involved, including Kim Cattrall and a pre-Heroes Hayden Panettiere.  They all did their best and made us believe their characters.

You could also describe Ice Princess as a sports movie for girls and be accurate.  Theyll certainly enjoy it the most.  Its an entertaining film that manages to rise above the normal to be entertaining.",1432684800,,2538,4.342553191489362

The same genre of movie as Lindsey Lohan's ""Mean Girls"", but the execution is so much more positive. Michelle Trachtenberg (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Hayden Pannettiere (Heroes, Nashville) are great semi-rivals who are really in different worlds but those come together when physics meets skating. Kim Cattrall (Sex in the City) and Joan Cusack are very enjoyable as protective mothers with very different instincts about feminism and playing to win. Their confrontation is one of the highlights of the film, which is also about setbacks and dusting yourself off and trying again.

2294836,4,B0009JE57Q,"Very sweet movie! The main character is respectful, driven, and charming. Overall, she and her mother, and the girl whom she eventually becomes friends with, are all driven by a sense of right and of being fair. Some of the other mothers, girls, and coaches exhibit cheating and some mild bullying, but there is redemption for the major case of this through the girls' drive to do the right thing. Main character Casey does forsake Harvard and her mother's dream for ice skating (her own dream), but in her reasons for doing so, she doesn't trivialize school and education, and she does emphasize art and finding what she in particular is passionate about. There is a teeny bit of sweet teen romance, involving a few kisses, but all the characters concerned are high school seniors, and Casey and her boy show care and kindness more than affection toward each other, so I would say it's alright for even younger girls. The mom-and-daughter drama is dramatically tense but never creates a climate of total disrespect from the children. All in all, I think this nicely captures what it can be like to be a late-teen, trying to discover what you really want to do in life, and I think that it nicely shows how you can follow a talent or a passion at any age, and be the better for having done it.",1385856000,2,1293,4.577586206896552
2294837,4,B0009JE57Q,"My daughter loves this movie.  She has autism and seems to identify with the awkward feelings of the girl throughout the movie.  It is humorous and clean.  While the idea of the girl turning Harvard down and the skater turning pro so soon is ridiculous, the aspects of the way that the individuals and relationships are transformed rings of some truth and is probably beneficial for young people who can be so intimidated by not fitting in and the false notion that it will always be that way.",1384905600,,493,4.579545454545454

Making yourself happy with who you are while still striving to make the best of yourself is a great message for coming-of-age and grade-school tweens who will realize that being smart and athletic are not mutually exclusive.  Defying the narrow columns that young adult life sorts kids into is a great idea.  I appreciated the main actress and her down-to-earth, positive, and mature perspective on her goals and challenges.

But after seeing it, I've only begun to remember the ridiculousness in disney movies, but even the Princess Diary wasn't as ridiculous.
first of, I don't care HOW TALENTED YOU ARE, a few months training CAN NOT, and I repeat CAN. NOT. make you master the triple jumps, in fact, they take a LIFETIME of ANY figure skater to master, this I find soley annoying. 2. any figure skating fan who watches figure skating constantly can see that Michell T just can't skate well, I mean, 'course she's good for someone who isn't a renouned figure skater, but even when she skates you can see her body is very tense and hard, not someone who has ""natural talent"" and graceful movements, the star of the show is the jumping shrimp, and alot of the other skaters who are obvious real skaters, not some actor who tries to skate but did her best, and got silver, gosh I have a big hard time believing that, and Michell Kwon too, you can feel the anger and annoyance in her voice. But what do they make up for that? yeah, she MAGICALLY did the triple jumps, I think this movie'll make any figure skater/figure skater fan really angry
Other than that would be the annoying disney formula: OF COURSE parents can never understand their kids, OF COURSE skating is more glamorous than school, and OF COURSE the science geeks don't have a life and they dress geek-ish. And yeah, one more thing: of course it's either Harvard or skating, GOD knows you can't do both!!! YEAH RIGHT, if she really won silver at such competition it won't matter, Harvard would LET her in non-the-less, and lots of athelets are honor students.
and what else? yeah, the physics, like tucking yourself in DECREASES the moment of inertia, NOT increase, common writer, DO some research at least!!! And everything else she talked about are simple Newtonian laws and equations, nothing impressive or advance as the book she's sleeping on in class- which is an AP physics book- I took the class, I know
they've only done two things right: 1. the blond girl isn't evil- THANK GOD! 2. she won silver with her fall- at least that's less fake, along with everything else...

2294932,4,B0009JE57Q,"""Ice princess"" is one of those blockbuster movies you cannot help but love. It certainly doesn't give you lots of food for thought, but it is entertaining, has good music, and at the end makes you feel happy you watched it. This movie will appeal mainly to young girls, but also to those adults that have nothing against Disney movies if they are well done.

The main character is Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg), the classical ""A"" student with not too many friends and a strict mother (Joan Cusack) that encourages her to study more and more, so she can earn a scholarship and go on studying. The problem is that to earn the scholarship she wants, Casey will have to find a project in which she can put a little of herself. Even though choosing what to do seems difficult at first, Casey realizes that she can combine her love for ice skating with physics, using physics to improve the skills of talented ice-skaters. In order to work on her project Casey will have to spend some more time on the ice rink, a place where she will discover an incredible talent she didn't know about, friends waiting to be discovered, and maybe even love. However, Casey will also have to make some choices, for example what and who she wants to be.

All in all, I can say that I loved ""Ice princess"". It was no more and no less than what I expected, a charming movie that provides good entertainment for children and teens, and allows adults to forget about everyday problems for almost 2 hours. Of course, recommended  :)

Plot: Casey is a 'nerdy' physics 'geek' in highschool who works hard at school (and is good at it) and shares her mom's dream of going to Harvard. When a physics scholarship comes up to help her get into Harvard, she decides to apply the laws of physics to figure skating. But her scientific interest turns into a personal passion which takes her, her mom, the local skate-rink owner/FS has-been, said woman's daughter and son and all of Casey's guts to chase her dreams.

Well? It's good. I mean it. The characters are not one-dimensional, they're real (though there are sterotyped fanatic parents--they're done in a fresh way). Best of all, there is no shallow, catty teen-girl drama. Instead everybody gets challenged, changed and redeemed... and then finally teary-eyed. Even you.

2294936,4,B0009JE57Q,"Michelle Trachtenberg is so irresistibly charming in `Ice Princess,' Disney's fairy tale that you might forget the incredible plot and a few cliches of the film. The film's main story, as some critics say rightly (and harshly), lacks originality, but the characters, especially the supporting ones, have surprisingly complex personalities.

The film begins unpromisingly with shaky and unsure direction. Brainy high-school girl Casey wants to win a scholarship, so she makes scientific researches on the physics of the skaters. For Casey is no stranger to the skills of skating (as we are shown in the opening), living in a small town of Connecticut. But Casey, as it turns out, has talent as figure skater. And by now, you already know Casey's real dream is not going to Harvard.

The film gets better as it goes on, introducing Casey's competitors including Gen (Hayden Panettiere), and Gen's manipulative mother (Kim Cattrall). Though Joan Cusack playing Casey's nervous mother gets top-billed in the credit, it is Michelle Trachtenberg and her charming heroine who grabs the interest of the viewers from the beginning to the end, whether you are a teenager or a thirty-something adult like me.

You might remember a similar romance `The Cutting Edge' (1992) in which figure skating plays a significant role in the film, and the actors have to be convincing as skaters. In 'Ice Princess' there is a love interest, handsome Zamboni driving Trevor Blumas, but his role is not very effective, looking as if an obligatory one. Still the crisp figure skating scenes of `Ice Princess' are entertaining, and the skaters look authentic enough to me, figure skating being one of the merits of `Ice Princess,' but some say (perhaps unnecessarily) that in the real world of sports the competitors cannot (or are not allowed to) do such programs. Is it so? I don't know, but I enjoyed watching them and that's what matter most, isn't that?

Like the same Disney's `Princess Diaries,' it is a modern fairy tale on screen, which fares unexpectedly better thanks to the leading lady's charms that come so naturally from lively Michelle Trachtenberg. And I liked 'Jumping Shrimp' too.",1139961600,,2171,5.072829131652661
2294937,4,B0009JE57Q,"Most teen flicks especially in the Lindsay Lohan- type genre I find silly and full of fluff. But this film definitely stands out strong than any Lohan film ever has. This film actually has a great storyline with some talented actors. I watched it late one night when nothing else was on and found myself drawn into the story almost immediately.

One reason why is because I do really enjoy ice skating, I find it a very artistic and beautiful sport and this movie did a good job of highlighting this sport. I know some people assume ice skating is nothing amazing, nothing you have to work too hard for and the young actresses in this film show well how hard you truly have to work and how much stress it is altogether, just like any other sport. So I really appreciated this movie for showing that for I do indeed have great respect for ice skaters and admire their talent.

The storyline from the beginning is interesting and is pretty rock- solid- a brainy girl all set for college but has a natural talent for ice skating and through possibly Fate she starts realizing how good she really is, and how happy she is when she skates. So she trains hard for ice skating, fleshing out her already natural talent, but unfortunately starting to ruin her chances for getting into the college of her choice because of all the time she puts into skating. Her mother is against skating, not having much respect for it because she feels skaters don't have much of a future and not very admirable. Overall the plot does not fall apart anywhere in the movie and even grows stronger with an ending that is not cliche thank goodness.

I give it a good solid four stars. I really enjoyed watching this film and applaud the strength of the cast members and the very theme of the story. It's an inspirational teenage drama that I give two thumbs up, something I hardly ever do for movies in this type of category.",1139616000,,1898,4.479768786127168
2294938,4,B0009JE57Q,"What do I think of when someone says ""Disney!""? Hmmm...kiddy films, girly stuff, princess(groan, we don't need more of that!), dreams come true and...cheesy?

Yep, all of the things above are in Ice Princess, with some fresh twists. With the ""mean rival"" changed to ""nice rival"", and add ""with hard work"" after ""dreams come true"". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it's an improvement.

The cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they're to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies.

The acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle's acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere's acting is also good, but it's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and ""Mary-Sue""ish. ""Mary-Sue""ish would mean that she's almost perfect. She's smart, good at sports and extremely popular also. It is very unfair, because on the page I'm writing this review on, it says ""Ice Princess (Widescreen Edition)~JOAN CUSACK. I know she and Kim Catrall or the ones with fame, and don't mistake me, the acting IS good, but Casey and Gen completely steals the stage, and in the place of Joan Cusack, it should be the names of those two.

The soundtrack is wonderful, especially Reachin' for Heaven and No One. Delicious songs! And Reachin' for Heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the 78th Oscar Nominations List. Good luck!",1138492800,,2029,4.72316384180791

2294940,4,B0009JE57Q,".... i think you'll love Ice Princess too. I think the writers were inspired by the 1979 movie, as this has some similiar moments, but without all that tragedy!!!!

There are some refreshing things about  this movie, also.

They are..

*that the physics ""nerd"" ( and main protagonist) didn't actually fit the stereotype of movie nerds. She was normal, other than being determined and brilliant.

*The Miss Popular was not the usual movie stereotype either. She was a kind, beautiful person who was a loyal friend.

*Unlike Ice Castles, to name one, this movie brought-it-home that skating professionally isn't always that much fun. ANd that it is alot of hard work. That it isn't enough to like it and be graceful, it has to be a deep passion. It actually made me think that I prefer a normal life.

To the plot, Casey, a physics genius, discovers a talent and love for figure skating but hides her new hobby and dream from her strict (and strange) mother.

Theres another asterix I forgot to mention.

*This movie never feels rushed. Plenty of time was put into each scene, so we could really see how Casey's interests and priorities switched from physics and Harvard, to skating.

The skating was nothing on Ice Castles (yet how could it be?Lynn-Holly Johnston is the best skater I've ever seen)and it really wasn't THAT spectacular. It was definitely not Michelle Trachenburg that was skating. No surprise there because she is an actress and not a skater. It was good skating but it wasn't world class. Not that I would know. But it didn't take my breath away, or anything like that.

The story, however, I found to be very enjoyable and nice.

Plot. Though she longs to become a gracefull figure skater Casey Carlyle has always done what her mother wants her to do. When Casey is offered a collage tuition to go to Harvard she has to take a test and the test has to be personal. So casey ends up trying to do mathametics on Figure skating and to make it more personal she does the test on herself too. Casey ends up impressing the Figure Skating Coach and joins the classes to get more exprince. But when casey puts her foot down to her mother and does what her heart tells her anything is possible.

The age of cable has seen just about every sport targeted from bowling and dirt biking to bubble-gum blowing.  But Ice Princess is at least a step above most of these and is definitely worth watching.

This is a story of a science geek trying to get into Harvard.  She has been planning it for years and has a chance at a scholarship if she can come up with a suitable physics projects.  Then, while watching figure skating on television she gets the idea to analyze the physics of the sport.  Soon she is deep in the world of young figures skaters and clashing with the local queen bee.  Sounds typical, but it isn't.  The queen bee is not the standard role and each of their mothers plays significantly in the plot.

Soon our hero is trying to make the project more personal by applying her findings to herself and other skaters.  It is then she discovers how much she really enjoys skating.  This allows for more hurdles and plot complications as well as some original plot moves.  Competitions are entered and families are revealed and dealt with.  There are a few cameos of famous skaters (one of the few stereotypes actually allowed in this film).  Ultimately the viewer is left at the end of the file realizing that they wouldn't mind watching it again.

While the movie is packed with drama it does help if you like watching figure skating as there is a lot of it even though it doesn't manage to overshadow the story.  Check it out.",1133136000,,1586,4.451388888888889

She has an harvard interview and cant decide what to chose figure skating or harvard. Watch the film and find out.

This filmI would recommend to all ages and sexes beacuse it is haert warming and makes you feel good inside and may even make you cry. I watched this film and since Im a dancer and everyhting I thought I would get the soundtrack cd and it was great so I would recommend you to get both!

2294950,4,B0009JE57Q,"Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is an intelligent high school junior who excels in physics and dreams of going to Harvard, by way of a physics scholarship, introduced to her by her teacher. To be eligible for this scholarship, Casey must come up with a `personal' science project. After watching the 1996 Olympics, Casey decides to do her project on the aerodynamic formula of figure skaters, specifically three junior level champions, Gen Hardwood, one of the more popular girls in her school, Nikki Fletcher, and Tiffany Mason.

After deciding that her project still lacked that `personal touch', Casey enrolls in a `Summer Sand plow' ice skating class, made up of mostly six-year-olds and coached by Gen's mom, Tina Hardwood. After displaying impressive raw talent, she decides to perform in the recital, where the judges give her a Junior Level pass, meaning that she could be on the same level as Nikki, Tiff, and Gen.

Even though Tina told her she would never be able to compete, Casey has her heart set on going to regionals. After dozens of practices, fights with her mom, and her after school job, Casey finally gets the chance to prove she can excel somewhere else, besides a lecture hall.

Ice Princess was not as bad as I expected. True, some parts were undoubtedly corny, but it was a nice story that I would recommend to anyone who likes happy endings.",1129939200,3,1373,4.858974358974359
2294951,4,B0009JE57Q,"When I tell you that this is the story of a brainy but shy girl who dreams of being a champion figure skater and that she meets up with a demanding anything-to-win coach and a cute guy who drives the Zamboni machine, you may think that there won't be any surprises. But there are, and they're all nice ones.

First is the characters, who rise above the level of the usual bland interchangeable stick figures for movies of this kind. Michelle Trachtenberg brings a nice shy spirit to Casey, the aspiring scientist/skater, and she has able support from the always-engaging Joan Cusack as her mother and the nicely flinty Kim Cattrall as the coach. But the nicest surprise is that after a spate of ""mean girl"" movies, this one gives us a character who competes with Casey but is honest, loyal, and supportive.

This is a story of a girl with a dream, but it is also the story of two mothers with dreams for their daughters, both based on dreams of their own that did not come true.

Casey's mother wants her daughter to become a brilliant scholar. She also wants Casey to dress in sensible (dowdy and middle-aged) clothes. She does not like the ""twinkie little outfits"" that figure skaters wear and admits that ""no matter how old the rest of us get, we will still always hate the prom queen.""

Tina (Cattrall) was once a figure skating champion who made a mistake that cost her a chance at an Olympic gold medal. She wants her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere) to get the gold medal she could not have. And when Gen tells her that she wants more than skating in her life, she does not listen. Both mothers have to learn that their daughters are entitled to their own dreams. The daughters have to learn that, too.

The story had an assist from The Princess Diaries author Meg Cabot, which may be why it feels like it should be called ""Ice Princess Diaries."" But the formula is nicely played out, with sincerity and sweetness enough to inspire the young viewers to come up with some dreams of their own.

Families who enjoy this movie may also enjoy The Princess Diaries, like this film, based on a book by Meg Cabot. Older viewers will enjoy some other ice skating movies like The Cutting Edge, Ice Castles and the movies starring real-life Olympic gold medalist Sonja Henie. This story has a lot in common with the classic children's book, ""Skating Shoes,"" part of the ""Shoes"" series by Noel Streatfeild, well worth reading aloud at bedtime. Families may also enjoy seeing Trachtenberg in Harriet the Spy, Cusack in School of Rock, and Panettiere in Remember the Titans and A Bug's Life, as the voice of an ant princess named Dot.",1129766400,,2627,4.578723404255319
2294952,2,B0009JE57Q,"For a long while I wanted to watch this movie, expecting it to be a fully realized story about dreams and the work required to reach those dreams.  In reality, this movie is little more than fluff and pudding.

The relationship between Casey, Tina, and Tina's daughter are all a bit contrived.  First, Tina's daughter (forgot her name) and Casey are on opposite ends of the social spectrum; one is popular, one is a geek.  Suddenly, and seemingly JUST because Casey becomes a skater, they are the best of friends.  There is no real story behind that, it just happens.  Bad writing.

Then you have Tina's mom.  For awhile you get the sense that Tina's mom is more interested in Casey's ability than in her own daughter.  This movie seriously gives off that impression, and the daughter's reaction to how Tina responds to Casey is seriously in favor of this view - until of course, Tina suddenly (ie: without any storyline warnings) decides her daughter's skating is more important than Casey's.  Um, yeah.  Act like it the whole movie, please.

Then Casey and her mom.  All you get from Casey's mom is a brief glimpse at someone who has little knowledge of anything other than Harvard dreams and what she THINKS she knows about womens rights.  There is really very little understanding between the two, and Casey's decision making seriously leaves a lot to be desired.  Harvard or skating?  On the brink of blowing away the Harvard interviewer with absolute brilliance, the ONLY thing she can tell her mother about skating?  ""I'm good!""  Well sheesh, getting into Harvard requires someone to be REALLY good at something, no?

Then you've got the relationship between the four skaters.  It was made seemingly apparant at the beginning of the movie that the first three share ice time, and we were only introduced to ONE coach (Tina).  So something is seriously missing.  Either you need separate ice times for each skater, two more coaches, or show how all the skaters HAVE the one coach.  Aside from Casey and Tina's daughter, the other two girls never act like they even HAVE a coach - and if they do, that it's not Tina.  They even drive to competitions together...

How about the 'standoff' between Casey and her mom, IF you can call it that.  Casey just says she wishes her mom would watch, oh please whinewhine please watch!  You know what?  It worked!  No wonder there's so many messed up children in the world.

And after Tina mentions the high price of skating, the only thing we are treated to is Casey-the-hot-dog-vendor.  Plus, it seems she becomes an 'average' student now.  Well, I don't know about you, but if I was going to try to give some half-clue to kids about dreams, I WOULD NOT show that they can't go hand-in-hand with school.  Do you even know how many athletes are acing their honors classes?  Why drain a science 'geek' with 'natural' science ability to mere average just because she's working/skating?

The soundtrack is a mixed bag, too.  Some songs are good (No One Else is quite nice), and some songs are just plain bad.  Most of the time the music fits, but sometimes it just doesn't.

The actual ice skating...  there's one redeeming quality here, and that's the 'jumping shrimp'.  Truly, the skating is ameteurish for all skaters - what do you expect - but the 'jumping shrimp' at least skates with the same brightness that made Dominique Moceanu and Carly Patterson so brilliant to watch in gymnastics.

This movie is fine for people who don't care about missing plot points or a thin plot hiding behind even thinner subplots, but for the more mature viewer watch something else.  And if there are any adults that want to watch a REAL 'figure skating dream' movie, go watch The Cutting Edge.",1128124800,3,3724,4.710077519379845

Kim is a perfect choice for Tina the former skate star, having the athletic physique and the beauty that one associates with ice goddesses such as Michelle Kwan, who makes a delightful cameo as a commentator.

I was already a Michelle Trachtenberg fan from her days as Sarah Michelle Gellar's younger sister in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and she is absolutely perfect for the role of Casey.

Rated G, this movie is for everyone with no cursing, no skin, no double entendres, sex or violence. Brainy Casey, in an effort to get a physics scholarship, undertakes a project to study how physics controls a figure skater's elements. She quickly figures out the effect on jump mechanics and puts into practice to become a championship skater herself. Farfetched? Yeah, a bit, but it's reasonable enough for an audience and even real skaters to buy into, and the film teaches valuable lessons about the virtues of education, good sportsmanship, and ethics as well.

1988 Olympic gold medalist and two-time Olympic medalist (silver, 1998 and bronze, 2002) Michelle Kwan make charming cameos as themselves turned ESPN commentators. The skating itself is top-notch. Highly recommend this movie to any age.",1126483200,,1028,5.224242424242425

A decent, if cliche ridden film good for little kids.  My daughters loved it.

But----and this is a big but give it three stars for pounding the kids with the message that you cannot be a star athlete (figure skater) and a good student.  That you cannot attend an elite college and be a champion - you MUST give up you brain for brawn.

Apparently the producer and director have never heard of two-time Olympic figure skating champion and five time world champion Dick Button, or Olympic medalists including Paul Wylie, two-time Olympic champion Tenley Albright, John Mischa Petkovich, or earlier Olympic champions like Hugh Graham, Franklin Nelson or back in 1920 - Nathaniel Niles.  What do they all have in common?  All Harvard graduates who went on to professional skating careers, as well as law school, medical school etc. etc.

A horrible message to send kids - particularly when Harvard's connection to figure skating is so well known that this element of the plot line seems almost a calculated deceit.",1126137600,,1481,4.864541832669323
2294959,4,B0009JE57Q,"Casey Carlyle, (played by the talented and engaging Michelle Trachtenberg), is a gifted high school junior who excels in physics and dreams of continuing her education at Harvard after graduation. Her teacher proposes that she compete for a coveted science scholarship, and asks her come up with an original idea for her summer project which reflects her as a well-rounded individual. He wants Casey to impress the Ivy Leaguers and the scholarship board. Casey can certainly use the money. She lives with her mother, (Joan Cusack), a feminist university professor who grew up in a time when women had far fewer opportunities, academically and professionally, than they do today, especially in math and science. The Carlyles have limited finances, and tuition at Harvard is not cheap!

Casey also loves to skate, and one of her favorite activities is to figure skate on a small pond, near her home, that freezes-over each winter. She comes up with an idea for her science project while thinking about the sport. She will demonstrate how laws of kinetic energy apply to figure skating. While videotaping athletes at the local rink, Casey comes into contact with former Olympic hopeful, Tina Harwood, (Kim Cattrall), who now instructs youngsters who have dreams of becoming gold medal champions. Harwood is also a ""skating mom,"" who pushes her daughter endlessly and ruthlessly to dedicate her life to the sport. Gen Harwood, (Hayden Panettiere), one of the school's most popular girls, likes skating, but is nowhere near as dedicated or as ambitious as Tina would like her to be.

Meanwhile, Casey believes that the ""personal touch"" her physics teacher talked about, is missing from her project, so she takes to the ice herself. She enters Harwood's beginners' class and after demonstrating raw talent, Tina agrees to coach her. Casey convinces her appalled mom, who thinks skating costumes, ""the twinkly little outfits,"" are demeaning to women, that her efforts are for the good of science. Oh, and Teddy Harwood, (Trevor Blumas), Tina's handsome Zamboni driving son, begins to take more of an interest in the new skater also. The two make a cool couple, and the material is fine for preadolescent audiences.

I found ""Ice Princess"" to be a refreshingly intelligent film that everyone in the family can enjoy. Its emphasizes that girls can do well in science and math, and that a young women can be extremely smart and still be graceful and attractive - there are no dork stereotypes here. The movie also depicts the hardships athletes go through in order to compete at high levels - not just in rigorous physical training, but in sacrifice of personal time, social activities, special and limited diet, and the high cost in dollars of most sports, with equipment, coaching, costumes/uniforms, etc.

The pushy parent syndrome is also depicted, and NOT prettily. I don't know which is worse, those folks who sacrifice to allow their kids to compete athletically, and then lay on the guilt to push the teens to the max, or the intellectual feminist tofu-eating mom who has her daughter's life mapped out for her, living it vicariously. Fortunately, Joan Cusack has the humor and lightness of touch to pull off her role without being too unlikable. And Kim Cattrall does very well as the ex-diva, flinty-eyed skating coach, although I can still spot sly Samantha from ""Sex in the City"" in the G-rated twinkle in her eyes.

I love to watch figure skating so was easily induced to watch ""Ice Princess,"" (not my usual film fare), with a friend's daughter. Olympians Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano make cameo appearances here as sports commentators, and top notch skaters double for the actresses with the more difficult jumps and routines. I was most impressed by lead Michelle Trachtenberg, who had no professional skating experience before she began filming. Apparently, she spent months in intense training sessions learning to figure skate. Some of her fellow competitors, like the punk skater and ""the Jumping Shrimp,"" (Kirsten Olson), are stand-outs.

Author Meg Cabot, (""Princess Diaries""), co-wrote the intelligent screenplay with Hadley Davis. British director Tim Fywell  was drawn to the underlying theme of ""a girl's empowerment."" He stated, ""This story is about the way that teens need to discover their own dreams, not their parent's dreams or the dreams they think they are supposed to have."" Sounds good to me.

2294960,4,B0009JE57Q,"In the year 2001, Hollywood was looking at the very serious possibility of having all of the actors, directors, and writers being on strike at the same time. In preparation of this possibility studio heads started greenlighting every project that they could so that they would have plenty of episodes and projects under wrap if they needed them. As things turned out, the strikes never happened. However, other than a brief slowdown for a couple months following September 11, 2001, the industry doesn't seem to have let up on the amount of garbage that is still being churned out. Before the strike-churning began, only about 1/3rd of the movies a person watched were worthwhile. Nowadays, a person is lucky if 1/5th of the movies they see are worth mentioning again to other people. As a result, whole new sub-genres of movies have developed over the past four years. Instead of just romantic comedies, there are teen romantic comedies, romantic comedies for adults, romantic comedies starring animals, etc. Another such sub-genre that has developed over the past few years is teen chick flicks.

Teen chick flicks are basically chick flicks that star teenage girls (or actors pretending to be teenage girls) and only appeal to a pre-teen age/early teen age female audience. The majority of teen chick flicks aren't worth the film used to make the movie, not to mention all the hidden messages these movies contain that have a negative impact upon a young lady's self image, e.g. ""Only if you dress like a Hollywood starlet will you then be able to attract a boyfriend worthy of your beauty.""

When I first heard about ICE PRINCESS, I thought to myself, ""Oh great, another terrible teen chick flick."" When I saw that it was from Disney, it made it that much worse. However, after having been presuaded to watch the film, I can say that ICE PRINCESS is not the typical teen chick flick and is much better than I ever expected it to be.

The movie weaves a tale around the fictional character of Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg), a female high school science whiz from the northeastern U.S. who likes to figure skate in her spare time. Casey has the opportunity to win a full ride physics scholarship to the college of her dreams: Harvard. However, as part of the application procedure, Casey has to create a physics project that both demonstrates scientific principles and applies them to a real life situation. It takes Casey awhile to figure out what she is going to do, but after watching some classmates practice in a local rink, she gets a brilliant idea and begins working on a computer program that can help figure skaters become better skaters. Of course, (just like all those crazy mad scientists in old sci-fi movies) in order to make sure the program truly works, she has to test it out on herself. In doing so, Casey unleashes a long heart-felt desire to skate within herself and soon finds herself questioning everything she thought she has always knew.

ICE PRINCESS is a Disney movie and it is mostly a teen chick flick, so the plot is kind of predictable. At the same time, the movie doesn't take the usual twists. That is probably what I found most unusual about the film. Though it is full of hope and promise, the movie makes it a point to illustrate that life isn't always fair and that we can't always have everything we want (or think we want). It also points out some of the nasty things about starting out in professional sports (e.g. the expense, the time committment, etc.) that many sports movies never even infer, let alone mention.

Though the movie will probably be most enjoyed by young girls, the film does have some appeal to adults. The movie has some really fine acting, especially considering the type of film it is. Kim Cattrall plays Tina Hardwood (you've got to love those puns) the very demanding, yet very talented skating coach who becomes a mentor to Casey. Trachtenberg does a great job in her first motion picture starring role. The actors in other secondary roles do a nice job, too. However, the person really to watch in this movie is Joan Cusack (the Cusack siblings are quite talented, but in my opinion Joan is a better actor than brother John). Cusack plays Casey's hard-working, feminist single mom. In the hands of a less talented performer, Casey's mom would have seemed bitter and envious, but with Cusack in the part, the audience feels sympathetic for her, even when she is being most smothering.

ICE PRINCESS is rated G. Therefore, there is no foul language, sexual references, or violence. It's a movie that young girls will surely enjoy. However, adults might enjoy the movie, too, if they give it a chance.

The DVD version of the film includes a couple of music videos, a commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening scene. The music videos aren't too bad too watch a feature some possible future teeny-bopper stars. Most of the deleted scenes don't add much to the plot, but the alternative opening provides the audience with a deeper understanding into Casey's life.",1125014400,,5046,4.786452353616533
2294961,5,B0009JE57Q,"""The most amazing thing about ICE PRINCESS is that it's about a girl that everyone can connect with, someone going through an experience most people go through at some point in their lives, but in a really magical way."" ~ Michelle Trachtenberg

Ice Princess is a warm family story with a chilly start and a romantic conclusion. Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) seems to be fighting on all fronts and also must endure a heightened level of teenage angst while competing against her peers. Trapped in the cocoon of expectations, Casey struggles to live her dream and makes life-changing decisions. Should she attend college or reach for her newfound love: Ice Skating.

Ever since I watched Michelle Trachtenberg dancing in the Buffy Musical, I have wondered about her dancing talents and how her natural elegance would be portrayed in future movies.

When Michelle started this movie, she had no professional experience skating and the most impressive part of this movie is that she spent months and months in intense training sessions, learning to figure skate. She trained for five hours a day, five days a week. Skating doubles performed the more challenging maneuvers, while she was able to do a significant amount of the skating and this is quite impressive.

I could relate to people discouraging me from ice skating and one of the last songs I remember being played at my childhood ice rink in Africa was ""Another One Bites The Dust."" While my dreams of dancing and skating bit the dust at an early age, Casey Carlyle can't be beat, stands up to the cheat and does more than stand on her own two feet and declares her Ice Princess dream.

2294962,4,B0009JE57Q,"Michelle Trachtenberg turns in a wonderful performance as Casey Carlyle.  She's two parts Physics whiz and one part dreamer.  When she decides to find a formula that explains how ice skaters manage to pull off some of their stunts, Casey finds herself wanting to participate on the ice.

First she joins up with some little kids, but after a little encouragement from the judge's panel, she decides to pursue her dream of becoming a skater and sloughs off her mother's dream of her going to Harvard.  Her mother, played well by Joan Cusack, wants her daughter to have everything that she never did.  She doesn't, however, want her to waste her time on ice skating.  Kim Cattrall proves that she can play more than a ""Sex In The City"" floozy by turning in a solid performance as Trachtenberg's ill-willed coach.

The rest of the cast is very strong, from Cattrall's daughter and son to the ""Jumping Shrimp,"" everyone does well.  The on-ice action is well executed.  The plot is sugary sweet, but Trachtenberg handles the saccharin well here, and I didn't grow tired of watching it.

This is an excellent family film.  It's one of a couple of Disney live-action flicks that have impressed me as of late, the other being ""Sky High.""  The language is minimal and there is no violence at all.  It's a good story of a dreamer being pulled in one direction by a well-meaning parent and tugged in the other direction by a desire to be in the spotlight.  Overall, a very good film and one for the whole clan.

Highly recommended to those with kids of all ages and anyone who enjoys a good movie about working hard to realize your dreams.",1124323200,,1628,4.604166666666667
2294963,4,B0009JE57Q,"This is a good movie for young people to watch as it teaches them that you can change your mind about the order of your goals' passions, and that you can make dreams come true if you want them badly enough.  Michelle Trachtenberg gives a very good and likable performance as Casey Carlisle, a high school senior who is well on her way to being a physics major when she reaches college.  In order to get a scholarship, she not only devises a project that scientifically nails figure skating moves, but decides to take part in the sport herself to prove her thesis more credibly.  What happens instead is that she discovers she has a real talent for skating and decides to embark in some serious competing.

As an adult, it's a nice family movie, but you will recognize that Disney has a knack for putting out cookie cutter teen flicks with different themes.  A young person won't realize this because the skating is quite good, and the storyline is never boring.  Kim Cattral is worthy as the coach who sometimes genuinely deserves to be hated, but respectably knows her stuff, and Joan Cusack is simply wonderful as Casey's protective, pushy, but admirably feisty mother.  Then again, I have never seen a movie where Joan's appearance was ever a bad thing.  The costumes are very pretty, the routines wonderfully choreographed.  The film is a bit unrealistic, but it makes its point quite clear about going for what you want, and that is entertaining enough.  I will give them props for not letting her win a gold medal at the end, yet allowing her to keep competing with silver, so that it tells the viewer that hard work is often a reward in itself.  I didn't LOVE Ice Princess, but I enjoyed it, and it is worth seeing at least a few times.  It's simply good entertainment with a nice storyline and lesson, and there's definitely nothing wrong with that.",1124323200,,1857,4.6109422492401215

2294965,4,B0009JE57Q,"ICE PRINCESS is not the kind of movie to which this reviewer is usually attracted - the trappings indicate that we are in for a happy-wappy, sterilized, PG, Disney candybox. But, surprise!,  here is a film that is  better than its package.  Writers Meg Cabot and Hadley Davis have combined the sport of ice skating with the drama of teenage angst and come up with a credible tale of a 'science geek' discovering her talent and following her dream of figure skating.

Director Tim Fywell knows his way around the ice rink and the halls and lockers of high school kids and his preparation for the film is apparent.  Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a fine student who is encouraged by her physics professor to find a project that incorporates her personality along with physics that will assist her in gaining a scholarship to Harvard.  Casey's mother (Joan Cusack) is a pragmatist, a schoolteacher who wants Casey to succeed beyond the mother's status.  Casey loves to skate on their home pond, but one day happens into a private skating rink class owned by one-time star skater Tina (Kim Cattrall), a place where Tina relentlessly drives her daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere) toward winning prizes.  Tina's son Teddy (Trevor Blumas - a much underused handsome actor) is always around to keep the ice surfaces smooth with his machine.

Casey observes the brilliance of fine skating, thinks of a way to analyze moves on her computer that will diagnose aerodynamic physics aspects of skating, and once that is perfected, and she is able to aid the skaters with her scientific knowledge, she personalizes her theories. Before long has won a place along with the other aspiring skaters.  She encounters resistance from her mother, encouragement from Tina, and friendship from Gen and her fellow skaters as well as the eye of Teddy!  When Casey has her Harvard interview, she admits that her real love is for skating, not physics, and commits to pursuing that love full time.  The rest is predictable: all's well that end's well.

What sets this little film apart is the quality of acting from Trachtenberg, Cattrall, Cusack and Blumas: they create characters about whom we care.  The skating is fun to watch, and the 'sitting in the bleachers rooting for the good guys' feeling is refreshing.  This is not a great film but certainly one of the best of this genre.  It is most definitely a 'feel good' popcorn movie!  Grady Harp, August 05",1123891200,3,2432,4.849878934624697

This movie has a couple of my favorite actresses: Joan Cusack who we see EVERYWHERE and love, Kim Cattrall from Sex and the city (and of course Mannequin,lol), Michelle Trachtenberg who also played Buffy's sister Dawn in Buffy: The Series. This movie tells the story of a self proclaimed ""science geek"" who accidentally finds her calling as a figure skater. Will she turn down Harvard for the Olympics? Watch and see.",1123718400,,459,4.822784810126582
2294977,5,B0009JE57Q,"This is a surprisingly good film that completely exceeds the normal expectations placed upon the kind of product usually produced for the target audience. It is also quite intelligent and does not pander or insult or exploit the intelligence of young kids (or adults) the way some do, such as THE PRINCESS DIARIES II. The latter is a kind of wish fulfillment fantasy, almost pornography for little girls, while THE ICE PRINCESS would seem to be heading into the same direction, but stops to become something more.

Michelle Trachtenberg, who most of us know as Dawn from BUFFY (a controversial character, disliked by many, though I confess that I enjoyed her very much), does a great job in the lead role. In BUFFY she often seemed to be a bit too tightly wound in her role, a bit too intense. She seems more relaxed here, and she seems comfortable taking the central role. She plays Casey Carlyle, a young physics whiz whose feminist (in a good way) mother is pushing her to limits intellectually. When her high school physics teacher urges her to compete for a physics scholarship by taking on an additional project, she decides to study the physics of jumps in ice-skating. She begins studying the skaters at a local competitive ice-skating rink, and the mastery of theory makes her want to put it into practice. Much of what follows is predictable. Casey proves to be a natural at skating, and suddenly her desire grows to make her want to be as good a skater as she can be. Michelle is very convincing in these sequences. Anyone who saw her in BUFFY, especially in the famous musical episode, where she forewent singing to perform a surprising capable dance number, knows that she has a natural dancer's build, with long legs and ever longer arms. She seems incapable of an awkward pose. I know there are all kinds of vagaries attached to billing in Hollywood films, but by any standard it is bizarre that Michelle Trachtenberg was third billed in this film after the far less important Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall.

The competitive skating sections of the film are far more convincing than usual in such films. Partly this is because actual competitive skaters are used in almost all of the skating roles. And while they certainly used a stunt double for Michelle Trachtenberg's more challenging bits, there are enough moments where you can tell she is clearly doing her own skating to do her considerable credit.

The movie is not just about ice skating, but about the way that parents often impose their expectations onto their children, and the struggle that takes place before parents allow them to formulate their own dreams. This comes out not just in Casey's feminist and academic mother resisting Casey's wanting to fulfill her potential as a skater instead of a physicist, but in Kim Cattrall's character forcing her daughter into becoming a skater just as she was. Ironically, by the end of the film both mothers reluctantly allow their daughters to follow their own paths.

A pet peeve: academic inaccuracy. You don't ""blow off Harvard"" in the interview process. In fact, interviews with colleges play a minimal role in the acceptance process. In fact, being a competitive skater with good grades would dramatically increase your chances of getting into any good school. The best schools do not want one-dimensional academic grinds, but almost insist on well-rounded students with wide-ranging interests. OK, off my soapbox.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good movie, but I especially encourage parents to gently encourage their kids to see this exceptional movie in lieu of awful pieces of materialistic wish fulfillment pornography like THE PRINCESS DIARIES II.",1123545600,,3696,4.916666666666667

Michelle Trachtenburg proves she can carry a film, because she's the reason why I enjoyed the fulm so much. Her characters passion, excitement, love, and determination made me root for her. Kim Cattrall was great as the tough coach, and the always enjoyable Joan Cusack was great as Casey's mom. The film takes a nice little turn into grown up drama, but not so much that it loses it's kid appeal. Honestly I was shocked I loved this movie.

2294980,2,B0009JE57Q,"Disney and family films are two things that go hand in hand. We can always count on the company Walt founded to produce some good, quality entertainment each year and it often releases a few full- length movies each season with a family- oriented theme. ""Ice Princess"" is a film made for kids and while it isn't necessarily a bad movie, it certainly doesn't measure up to some of Disney's better works.

The main problem I have with this movie is its total simplicity. The plot is basic and predictable: A girl daydreams about becoming a star ice skater; fantasizes as she watches other skaters; determines to go for her dream; encounters some resistance from parents; and finally achieves her dream in the end. You already know what will happen after the first fifteen minutes.

Because this film is aimed at the 12 and under child market (female more than male) it doesn't have much substance. There are no twists to the plot, no major crises, no huge conflicts or barriers to overcome, etc. Even the main character's mother offers very little resistance to her daughter's choice for a new career. She wants her little girl to become an academic scholar at Harvard, but changes her mind very fast. It's a little unrealistic and it makes for a dull motion picture.

Kim Cattrall plays the coach in this movie and I found her to be quite good and believable. This is a very different role for Cattrall who is best known for her stint as television's sultry Samantha Jones. But Catrrall alone cannot save this movie. It is recommended only for those with young daughters in the home. Everyone else will find bland and forgettable.",1123200000,3,1629,4.708771929824562

2294994,5,B0009JE57Q,"Michelle Trachtenberg turns in an amazing performance as Casey Carlyle, the math and science geek turned adorable skating champion.  In fact, she just about carried the whole film on her shoulders as I didn't really see anyone in this film get past the after-school-special acting grade.

I really liked the script for this movie.  It was believable, fun to watch unfold on screen, and different from anything that I had seen before.  I currently have teenage daughters who are both trying to decide what they are going to do after high school, so I can relate to the stress Casey's mother must have felt when Casey made a dramatic change in her plans.

This movie does a good job of dealing with the stress we all feel in life; which passion will we follow, and is it the right passion?  This movie also addresses the pressure put upon child athletes by their coaches and parents - while it can be healthy at times it can also be very destructive.  Casey's mom wants a better life for her daughter, as most moms do, but she also loves her daughter enough to - in the end - let her make the decision that will forever change her life.

I saw this movie as an example of how parents try and guide their children as best they can, but it is eventually up to the children to make decisions based on experience and their own character.

As I stated earlier, Trachtenberg carried the acting in this film.  Her facial expression, dialogue delivery, and bearing were well beyond her years.  She has that ""it"" factor that all of Hollywood is after.  I plan on purchasing this DVD very soon.  I think it is one that people will want to watch every few years.

This is a good movie that I recommend.

2294998,4,B0009JE57Q,"This is a delightful, wholesome film that is tailored for a general audience and should provide fun for the whole family. It is a coming of age story of a teenage girl, who is engaging in some self-discovery that may change her life.

Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a somewhat shy, geeky girl, who  lives in a rural area with her mother, Joan Carlyle (Joan Cusack).  Her mother, a professor at a local backwater college,  feeling that she herself did not always make the best choices when she was younger, pushes Casey hard to excel academically, envisioning Harvard on her daughter's college horizon. Casey is an outstanding student, as she is an extremely bright girl, and is, in fact, a physics whiz. She also loves to figure skate on the pond in her back yard, but as her mother stresses academics over athletics, this is just an enjoyable pastime for Casey.

Then, her high school science teacher tells her that she stands a good chance to get a scholarship to pursue physics at the college level. The scholarship requires that she develop a physic project, and the teacher counsels Casey to ground the project in something for which she has a passion. Casey decides that she will have her physics project revolve around the dynamics of figure skating. This project, which is actually quite interesting, will consume Casey's senior year in high school.

Casey gets herself over to the local skating rink run by figure skating Coach Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall). There, Coach Harwood rules her skaters, one of whom is her own daughter, Gen (Hayden Panettiere), and a fellow classmate of Casey, with an iron hand. As Casey becomes more involved in the world of figure skating, she decides that  her project would benefit from some first hand experience. So, she, too, sets foot on the ice, not just as an observer but as a participant. What she discovers along the way, about herself, as well as about others, helps her to be true to herself and to make a decision that brings her happiness.

This is a well-acted film with excellent production values.  Michelle Trachtenberg is a delight in the main role, infusing her character with intelligence, decency, and a certain innocence that makes the viewer take to her character immediately.  Joan Cusak, looking remarkably aged, is good in the role of Casey's mother, a highly intelligent, articulate woman who seeks to have her daughter experience the academic and economic success that she herself was unable to attain.

Kim Cattrall, however, is a standout in the role of the coach whose own dreams of figure skating glory were shattered years earlier, and who now looks to her daughter, Gen, to make those shattered dreams a reality for own self, although Gen may have other ideas. Hayden Panettiere is excellent in the role of Gen, the beautiful girl who just wants to be able to live her life as other teenage girls do, rather than figure skate competitively.

Trevor Blumas is well cast in the role of Teddy Harwood, who runs the Zamboni machine at the skating rink and functions as a wholesome love interest for Casey. Kirsten Olsen is quite funny in the role of red-headed Nikki, a petite, very competitive skater known as the ""Flying Shrimp"" for her prowess on the ice. Julianna Cannarozzo is also very funny in the role of  punky looking and cynical  Zoe Bloch, another competetive figure skater. Both Nikki and Zoe are amusing to watch, whenever they are on screen. For some added interest, Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano make cameo appearances. Those who like figure skating will especially enjoy this film.

The film provides a peek at the world of figure skating and the lengths to which some people will go to succeed in that competitive world. While some of the film may not be realistic, one should just chalk it up to artistic license. The film also delivers a message to both children and parents. For the children, the message seems to be that they must discover something in life that they are passionate about and follow their heart. For parents, the message seems to be that children must follow their dreams and not that of the parents. Sounds like good advice to me!

The DVD is a high quality production that provides crystal clear audio and visuals. It has a number of bonus features. Among those features is an alternate opening scene that I thought was quite good, as well as a number of deleted scenes. The DVD also contains two  music videos, ""Reach"" by Caleigh Peters and ""No One"" by Aly and A.J., which all viewers should enjoy.  There is also an excellent and lively commentary by its four young actors, Michelle Trachtenberg, Hayden Panettiere, Kirsten Olsen, and Trevor Blumas. Their commentary adds to one's enjoyment of the film the second time around.  It is a commentary that kids can also enjoy.",1121731200,23,4798,4.800970873786408
2294999,4,B0009JE57Q,"Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a science geek.  There is no simpler way to say it.  She is an excellent student who gets straight A's and her physics teacher believes that she has the chance to gain a major physics scholarship.  To make the most of this chance she needs to spend the summer before her senior year of high school working on a project which demonstrates a practical application of physics and her teacher suggests that she ""makes it personal"".  Casey may be a science geek, but the earliest scenes of the movie show Casey gracefully skating on a pond near her home.  Inspiration for her physics project hits while watching a skating competition on television with a friend.  Casey realizes there has to be a mathematical formula for the jumps and spins performed by a skater and this can be used to help improve the form of a skater.

Casey goes to the Harwood Skate Center run by Tina Harwood (Kim Cattrall) a former world class skater.  After a brief bump in the road, Casey is allowed to film Tina's skaters and work on her science project.  After Casey thinks she has her work figured out she goes to the rink with a friend to film her practical application.  She attempts to land a jump and amazingly enough, she does, and with perfect form.  Casey begins taking lessons from Tina and starts focusing more on skating than on her studies.  It becomes something of an obsession, much to the dismay of her mother Joan (Joan Cusack), who is much more into intellectual pursuits and is something of a feminist.  Casey, however, is starting to pursue her dream of seeing how far she can go in figure skating.

Much of this movie is fairly standard stuff.  Whatever obstacles are placed in Casey's way will be overcome with some pluck and perseverance.  There is a boy to impress.  Casey is something of the ""ugly duckling"" of her school because of her brains and how she starts babbling about science when gets nervous.  There are moments, particularly in the skating scenes, that we fully expect to see and we are not disappointed.  Somehow, though, there is enough charm and realism and good performances that ""Ice Princess"" works.  Michelle Trachtenberg does a very fine job as Casey and makes her a believable student as well as skater.  I'm sure a double is used, but very often it looks like Trachtenberg herself skating.  The movie also avoids several cliches by having a popular student (Hayden Pannettiere) who snubs Casey early on also be Tina's daughter and a skater.  But Gen befriends Casey when they finally have something in common and it turns out that Gen is a decent person and not the standard snob that I expected when the character was first introduced.

The DVD contains a series of deleted scenes which are pleasant enough, but do not add to our understanding of the characters or make the movie work better.  There are two music videos, and a commentary track featuring some of the kids who were in the movie.  As far as special features go, this is pretty standard and is probably worth watching just once.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by ""Ice Princess"".  I thought it was going to be horrible to watch and I was very wrong.  I am as far from the target audience as you can get (a 26 year old  male), but enjoyed the movie.  It's not great or deeply original, but it is very pleasant.  It is a true family film and I suspect that the teenage and pre-teen girls will love it.  Rated G, parents have nothing to worry about if they let their children watch ""Ice Princess"" unsupervised.

2295000,4,B0009JE57Q,"Girls will love this film.  How couldn't they what with the ice skating, romance, rooting for the under dog and mothers who don't understand their daughters?  What's really surprising is that other family members are equally likely to be enchanted by Ice Princess.

Why?  Well, Ice Princess is a very solid family film.  Sure the movie is predictable and it's yet another film where the heroine chooses the princess role over the more practical yet less glamorous role of professional independent yet it remains somehow compelling.  Most of the charm is courtesy of the talented Michelle Trachtenberg who is extremely likable.  But the rest of the cast pulls off their roles with aplomb as well.  Both Joan Cusack and Kim Cattral are convincing as a mothers who want the best for their daughters but go about it in the wrong ways.

Along with the winning performances, what makes this film stand out from it's peers is the writing.  We're given characters who do not play the typical roles.  The one we think is going to be the villain turns out to be a true friend, the good-hearted trainer turns out to have ulterior motives.  They're small deviations, but they make the conventions seem a bit more fresh.

Typically for a family film, the bonus features are mostly forgettable.  The cast commentary in particular should be avoided at all costs if you don't want to subject  yourself to endless squeals of joy and exclamations of ""Oh that's cool.""  A few of the deleted scenes (one in particular) shed some light on other directions the director was considering.  They are the most illuminating of the bonus features.

Bottom line:  If your family liked the recent Freaky Friday remake, you'll most likely enjoy Ice Princess as well.  Ice Princess is the kind of film Disney should be making more of.  Family films that convey a moral without talking down to the audience.",1121558400,,1874,4.8119122257053295
2295001,3,B0009JE57Q,"We had a chance of watching ""Ice Princess"" on DVD and found it to be an enjoyable family movie. The story was a bit predictable: a young school girl who's great at physics finds out her true passion lies in figure skating, while working through a Physics project to help her gain a scholarship to study in Harvard. She faces misunderstanding at multiple levels: her mom who has ""bigger plans for her""; the other skaters, who live to train, and their coach (played by Kim Cattrall, Amanda from ""Sex and the City""); and all the people she meets, whom she can't avoid to shy away with her physics 'mumbling'.

In spite of its predictability, it turns out to be a nice family movie that teaches a good lesson: to pursue one's own dreams, in spite of external pressures, is the one true road to happiness. As for the DVD, besides the movie, it offers a few deleted scenes, an alternate opening, a couple of music videos, an audio commentary and a French track.

2295012,5,B0009JE57Q,"It's amazing that the wonderfully brutal sport of hockey and the graceful sport of ice skating take place on the same surface - it took a while, but I've actually come to appreciate the sport of figure skating (well, women's figure skating, anyway).  Ice Princess, naturally enough, is all about figure skating - but it's really about so much more than that: pursuing a dream, doing what you love, having the courage to take chances and make big decisions, dealing with parental pressure at its best and worst, competing with honor, and basically just figuring out what you want and taking control of your own life - and, yes, it's also about Michelle Trachtenberg looking absolutely gorgeous.  Disney always puts out good films; Ice Princess is fairly predictable, but there's nothing wrong with a predictable story that inspires you and makes you feel good - and the film actually isn't quite as predictable as I thought it would be.

Michelle Trachtenberg plays Casey Carlyle, a science geek who loves skating out on the pond but is focused on winning a physics scholarship to Harvard.  The story doesn't really work the high school misfit angle very hard, but it's not really the focus of the movie, anyway.  Casey needs to come up with a personalized physics project to impress the Harvard recruiters, and so it is that she turns to ice skating with all of its angles, velocities, vectors, and mathematical implications as her ticket to achievement.  It's not enough to watch and study the skaters training under the local coach Tina Harwood (Crow T. Robot's favorite actress, Kim Cattrall), though; she begins taking skating lessons herself (surrounded by much younger, competitive little students) to put her theories to the test, and she discovers she has some real talent.  Before long, she's actually competing in sectionals - where she discovers just how cut-throat the figure skating profession can be.  Standing at the first major crossroads of her life, Casey has to choose whether she will give up skating and go out and get that Harvard scholarship or if she will make the sacrifices necessary in order to see just how far she can go in the sport.  Her mother and her coach complicate things.  Casey's mother Joan (Joan Cusack) has always dreamed of her daughter matriculating at Harvard and finding lifelong success by using her brilliant mind, and she can't understand why Casey would even think about putting her academic future in jeopardy by pursuing what she sees as an impossible dream.  Casey's coach, Tina, has always pushed her own daughter to succeed at figure skating, and she's rather ruthless about making that dream of hers come true - although it's really not what her daughter wants for herself.  Joan and Tina could not be more different - yet in time we see they are surprisingly alike in terms of pushing their own dreams onto their daughters.  It's a theme that any past, present, or future teenager knows well.  In the end, Casey takes charge of her own life, risking not only Harvard but her close relationship with her mother.  It may or may not be the best choice, but it is definitely the right choice for Casey.

The figure skating scenes are really well-done; a lot of the difficult moves are actually performed by doubles, but you'd never know it by watching the movie.  You would also never know that two of the actresses are really skaters with no previous acting experience.  The whole transformation of Casey from science geek novice on skates to medal-contending skater would never happen in the real world, nor would the actual competitions resemble those in the movie, but the film's story comes across as very believable.  There's also a sweet touch of light romance on the side.  It's a feel-good story that inspires you to pursue your own dreams, whatever they may be, and I enjoyed it immensely.

The DVD comes with some nice little extras.  First, you have a number of deleted scenes, including a different opening to the film - one of these deleted scenes is quite interesting, for it would have put a much different spin on concluding events.  Second, you have a couple of good music videos (Reach by Caleigh Peters and No One by Aly and A.J.) featuring plenty of shots from the film.  The whole soundtrack of the film is excellent, by the way.  Finally, you have an excellent commentary featuring four of the young actors.  Most film commentaries tend to be extremely boring and surprisingly uninformative, but the commentary here is full of details and insight on the making of the film and is really a lot of fun to listen to because of the passion and fun these young stars bring to the whole experience of making the film.  It would appear that Disney has done it again: Ice Princess is a wonderful film that is both fun and rewarding for viewers of all ages.",1121385600,63,4823,4.786489746682751
2295013,4,B0009JE57Q,"It is interesting that Michelle Trachtenberg's name is third and last before the title of ""Ice Princess"" given that she is the title character.  Joan Cusak and Kim Cattrall get to go before her.  But then it took three ""Superman"" movies for Christopher Reeves to get top billing as the title character, so the young actress can just show patience and hopefully will build on what she has done on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and this 2005 Disney family comedy and move up the cinematic food chain without becoming a tabloid target like Lindsey Lohan or Hillary Duff.

Casey Carlyle (Trachetenberg) is a math whiz who likes to skate on the pond outside her house to help clear her mind.  So when she has an opportunity to get a Physics scholarship it makes sense that she would come up with a project to work out the physics of figure skating.  Casey gets Tina Harwood (Cattrall) to let her videotape the practice session of three aspiring junior figure skaters: Tina's daughter Gen (Hayden Panettiere), Tiffany (Jocelyn Lai), and the Jumping Shrimp, Nikki (Kirsten Olson).  But Casey wants to get into not just the theory but the practice, and ends up taking skating lessons from Tina with the little kids.  Well, it turns out that her computer program, along with her innate abilities, put Casey in the same class as the big kids.  At that point, Casey decides that she would like to actually compete at one of the most expensive sports for teenage girls in this country.  Meanwhile, Casey's mom, Joan (Cusack), does not know what her daughter is up to, which is just as good because she would not approve.  Then there is Teddy Harwood (Trevor Blumas), who likes to watch Casey skate and would probably like to watch her do her math homework as well.

I liked the fact that ""Ice Princess"" makes it clear that, at least with regards to figure skating, you have to be smart as well as skilled, a point that I think can be extraoplated to other sports as well.  The movie also delivers on the skating sequences, which are key to the film.  We know that Trachtenberg is going to be doubled for the hard stuff (i.e., doubles and triples), but director Tim Fywell (""I Captured the Castle"") does a good job of weaving the two together.  Plus, Trachtenberg really brings the delicate look of a ballerina to her skating, so there is a definite sense of combining art and athleticism in Casey's performances on ice.  It was also nice to see that the character of Gen was not the backstabbing teammate that such roles usually become in sports movies like this one.  This ends up being a surprise given Gen's mom, who is willing to do something underhanded for the last qualifying spot at sectionals (as opposed to selling your soul for first place at regionals or nationals).  But this indicates that the triad of conflict here is between Casey and the two key adults in her life, her mom and Tina (which is also familiar ground in sports movies).

I just wish they had set up the competitions better.  Certainly after what happened at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City (and I am talking Sarah Hughes winning the gold medal, not the judging scandal in the pairs competition), we all know how dramatic skating competitions can be.  Michelle Kwan and Brian Boitano show up as commentators, so certainly they could have explained what Casey would need to do (or what she has done) and what it would mean for how she finishes in the competition.  There is some notion that Casey is doing things she should not be able to do, but most of this is communicated after the fact as opposed to setting up a level of expectation to help build anticipation.  Casey's goal is more personal than the other skaters in the competition, which explains why they movie forgets about the Zoe versus Nikki subplot during the final act, even though that is a pretty good context (ala Hughes) in which Casey can skate.  But I think you have a stronger movie is Casey puts herself in a position to win and we are told she has to do x, y and z to pull off the upset and then we watched her try to do it.  It works real well in the real world, and it could be equally as effective here.

Even though I think it could have been better, ""Ice Princess"" is a solid enough Disney example of family entertainment featuring the sport that always has the highest ratings at the Winter Olympics.  In terms of extras on this DVD there is a commentary track by Trachtenberg, Panettiere, Blumas, and Olson, that consists mostly of memories of making the movies (e.g., Blumas broke the zamboni a couple of times).  Trachtenberg has a few insights into the story being told (e.g., she says she wanted the scene where Casey confronts Tina), and I think she might have offered us more along those same lines if she was sitting around with grownups.  Olson is able to talk about what really happens in junior skating competitions, as opposed to what the script comes up with, which only underscores my argument above that letting us in on how the game is played would have enhanced the movie.  However, this will not really matter to the tween-age audience that is going to be watching this DVD.  There are also music videos for Caleigh Peters's ""Reach"" and Aly & A.J.'s ""No One,"" a few deleted scenes (including an alternative opening), and trailers for movies targeted as the same demographic group such as ""Valiant"" and the first of ""The Chronicles of Narina"" films, ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.""",1121385600,2,5463,4.607843137254902

2295016,3,B0009JE57Q,"Ever since the success of the Princess Diary movies, Disney has been making movies and TV shows using the similar formula:  gawkish and socially inept girl follows her dreams.  In this case, the princess part is because she is a wonderkind on the ice.

Add to this mix a healthy dose of the popular blonde girl who eventually comes to recognize that Math is important, too and the witchy trainer and the mother who wants her daughter to follow in her own footsteps instead of going in her own and you have another Disney live action hit.  I went to see this with a friend who loves math and the movie made her happy because it starred a girl who loved math as the hero.  This is true, but by the end we also have a girl who gives up her gift in math to pursue ice skating.

I think what annoys me about this film, though, is that it reduces the art, the skill and the years upon years of practice something like ice skating takes into a math formula.  The movie tries to rectify this by saying ""an equation can't make you pull it off flawlessly"" but then we have a girl who hasn't been practicing too much and by the end of the film she's going to start preparing for the Olympics?  That kind of cheapens men and women who have been practicing since they were two to get ready for the Olympics.

Anyway, I miss the old Disney movies that had imagination and creativity.  The new ones all seem to be rehashes of the same forumlaic plot.  Instead of remakes and the same plot dressed up as ""princess Diaries on ice"", I'd like to see original and creative ideas.",1119830400,4,1559,4.286689419795222
2295017,3,B0009JE57Q,"I expected this movie to be interesting; the previews, as always, were somewhat deceiving.  It WAS interesting--a girl follows her dream, wins in the end...pretty typical, but cute.  Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a believable protagonist with admirable spirit, but I found the movie to be sorely lacking when it came to the actual skating--the main theme of the movie.

I am not a skater, but I am certainly not naive enough about the art to believe that someone can go from an amateur to a professional in only a few months.  So it is with Michelle Trachtenberg's character, who begins skating lessons to enhance her physics project for a scholarship and ends up becoming a competitive skater.  It's just not realistic: any athlete, dancer, musician, writer, etc. can tell you that.  It takes years of practice to do what Casey Carlyle ends up doing at the end of this film.

However, this impossible accomplishment seems to be what gave the movie its glitter.  I mean, who wants a movie where the heroine practices for years and never ends up being spectacular?  It's just not what your average moviegoer is looking for.  I, on the other hand, like to err on the side of reality, but that's just me.

Overall, this movie was cute.  Michelle Trachtenberg is a good actress, and I hope to see more of her in the future.  Still, ""Ice Princess"" didn't truly stick the landing.",1117584000,4,1385,4.7447698744769875
2295018,3,B0009JE57Q,"""Ice Princess"" was not a commercial success despite generally favorable reviews and Disney's costly promotional campaign. The promotional poster is great but did not make much of a difference.

What went wrong? At its core ""Ice Princess"" is a modern remake of 1949's ""It Happens Every Spring"". In that film Ray Milland plays an underpaid college professor and long-suffering St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. He is in his college lab one day working on developing a wood preserving chemical when a baseball comes through the window and smashes all the lab equipment. The chemicals get mixed into a new compound that repels wood. When rubbed on a baseball it causes the ball to jump away from wooden bats. He realizes the possibilities and takes a leave of absence to pitch St. Louis to the World Series. Most of the entertainment comes from having someone who has spent his life in the academic world trying to fit in with the much cruder world of professional sports.

""Ice Princess"" makes the main character a high school science wizard, changes the gender, and moves the idea to a skating rink. It is here that it hits its first problem. The professor in ""It Happens Every Spring"" is only playing baseball to earn enough money to marry his sweetheart, he doesn't feel comfortable taking on that responsibility on his low teaching salary. One of the themes is the disparity in salary between the two professions. Throughout the film baseball is always just his ""temporary"" occupation until he returns to teaching, the film is appealing because he always retains his identity as a professor.

""Ice Princess"" derails because Casey becomes a figure skater in order to change her identity and realize her ""feminine potential"", although this is masked by an unconvincing  claim that she is pursuing her dream. Which is totally bogus, as someone has already commented: ""as you watch you think to yourself, wow she is pretty, smart, and she is not even trying, which in any other situation leads you to believe that she was better than the girls who are popular and stupid"".  Many viewers spend the movie hoping that she will keep her more likable identity as the smart outsider girl.

Plus the idea is overused, so much so that ""Not Another Teen Movie"" satirized the metamorphosis of the: ""Ugly Duckling Girl Who's Really a Babe Underneath"". The joke being that both Chyler Leigh's and Michelle Trachtenberg's ugly ducklings look at least as good as the babes they transform into.

The basic premise of ""It Happens Every Spring"" was credible and although it raised some ethical issues, it was highly amusing. The ""Ice Princess"" premise is not even remotely credible and the disconnect is compounded because the premise is more central to the story.

Finally, unlike ""It Happens Every Spring's"" almost exclusive focus on its main character, ""Ice Princess"" is at least one story too many as you have several mother-daughter subplots which are contrived, stale, and boring.

Perhaps most amazing about the low box office for ""Ice Princess"" is that it is significantly padded by Michelle Trachtenberg's huge male fan base. This means that even more of the movie's target audience is staying away than the attendance figures would indicate. Seeing Trachtenberg is almost reason enough to watch the film, she is much better in her physics student identity but her scenes with Hayden Panettiere and Kristen Olson are also good. Although a failure commercially, it was a good career move for Michelle and a great showcase for her beauty and growing acting skills.

2295019,1,B0009JE57Q,"The idea in this movie is that academic pursuits are undesirable.  Look at the cover art.  The Academic Casey is geeky and weird.  But the Ice Princess Casey is wonderful!  Get a grip, people, and do NOT allow your daughters to be taken in by this Barbie-world drivel.  The thought that a young woman with a gift for the sciences would toss that away for frilly dresses and ""Princess"" status should be absolutely condemned.  Women in the sciences are few and far between; a movie should be made showcasing those scientific talents and how she and other young women can succeed in those areas.

2295020,4,B0009JE57Q,"Yes, this is a formula movie aimed at teenage girls, much the way there are formula movies aimed at teenage boys. So be forewarned.

  Having said that, this one is much better than the average predictable ice skating movie. Yes, it has the young skater who has to overcome all sorts of hardships before she ""makes it"" as a winning skater. Yes, it has the mother who doesn't want her to keep skating and doesn't believe strongly enough in her daughter's talent. Yes, you can tell where it is going before it gets there...most of the time.

  But somehow it still held my attention. Here's what makes it work:

 1. Michelle Trachtenberg. A talented actress (who really shone in her small but crucial role in the Buffy series on television), she seems to have only gotten better as an actress over time. More importantly, she seems to understand the allure, glamour and aura that surrounds skating and her passion for the sport is believable. Without her fine performance, this movie would lose much of its zing.

 2. A decent script, even if it isn't highly original. It still tugs at the heart strings.

 3. A movie that works for those who never lost their love of ice skating. Plus the film portrays, for the most part, decent values and is inspirational, besides being a very watchable film.",1113177600,6,1294,4.651982378854625
2295021,4,B0009JE57Q,"I, for one, really enjoyed 'Ice Princess'. However, the movie isn't for everyone. This is more of a chick flick than anything else. It's a good way to relax and get that fairy tale ending. I think the problem is that people are expecting this to be an award-winning film, especially since it'sMichelle Trachtenberg's first major role. Now, I adore Michelle and think that she's a good actress. However, if you're expecting an award-winning movie, then don't see this.

This is good for people who like the 'Princess Diaries' series, you know that kind of thing. It's a bit cheesy and extremely fluffy romantic-wise. But come on, who the heck cares? I really liked it. I think they did a good job showing how hard it is to be a skater and the fact that most athletes don't have that long of a career. If you really have talent, and want this life style, then you have to work hard for it. The movie didn't gloss over how hard a lifestyle skating is. In fact, I was rather surprised by how much Gen'smom was into skating....Tina, the mom,really pushed her daughter into skating. I likedhow Tina wastrying to live vicariously through her daughter's life untill Gen said enough.

I decided to just see Ice Princess, thinking it would be nothing more than a joke and a re-creation of The Princess Diaires. While the two movies are similar in tone and overall sweetness, Ice Princess is a good, funny movie of it's own.

Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg-- Eurotrip) is a physics wiz. She has a real knack for it and is convinced by her teacher to go after a Harvard scholarship. All she has to do is do a physics experiment, one that will reflect her personality. As a pond skater, she decides to study how skaters do their jumps and actually figure a mathematical formula for them. Soon, she's tangled up at the local rink, filming other skaters and beginning to love skating more than she ever thought she could. Toss a cute guy into the mix, a feminist mother (Joan Cusack, who is so funny in this role) who doesn't agree with prancing around in those little outfits, and a bitter coach (Kim Cattrall), and you've got a fun movie to see with the girls on a Friday night.

All in all, I had fun seeing this movie, and I'm glad I used the movie pass to see this one. Whether it's Harvard or skating with ""Has-Beens on Ice"" (as Casey's mom says), a girl should just do what she truly wants and not what everyone else wants. Very cute, only mildly cheesy in some spots (the party scene is ridiculous and not needed at all in this movie!), check this one out!

2295026,4,B0009JE57Q,"`Ice Princess' is a story about a girl finding out her ambition in life and going after it.

The story is pretty simple. Casey (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a physics geek, and her professor asks her to do a project during the summer that could help her get into Harvard. She sees a figure skating competition on TV and tries to relate the movements to physics. So she starts video taping the figure skaters in her school, but that's not good enough. In order to really understand the concept, she decides to join the team. Later, she finds out that she has a passion for the sport. However, she becomes confused as to whether she should pursue a career by going to Harvard or figure skating.

Michelle Trachtenberg did a wonderful job in playing Casey. I don't know whether she knew skating or whether she learnt it for the movie, but she did a really good job on screen. Joan Cusack, Kim Cattrall and Hayden Panettiere did well for their roles as well. Trevor Blumas did ok, even though he hardly had a role in the movie.

I don't know why some people are writing negative comments on this movie. First of all, you KNOW that this is a Walt Disney movie, so it's supposed to be family-oriented. Secondly, you probably saw the trailer or heard a little about the movie before actually coming to the theatres to see it, so you know what to expect!

8061895,2,B0009JE57Q,"This movie seems to reunite everything I hate about the stereotypes of figure ice skating all in one package.

The protagonist is a 17 year old named Casey that ocassionally did ultra basic figure ice skating when she was a kid and dropped out of the sport. She's now 17 years old and decides to perform a simple enough homework report on the physics that governs the rotational force to perform figures. Little did she know, she applies the common knowledge of pulling her arms together during a Toe Loop (a figure that she apparently never learned to perform growing up) and somehow lands a solid Double.

She then finds the sport to be exciting and convinces a brash teacher rather brilliantly played by Joan Cusack to train her for fun. After the expected teenage romance with a hunky Zamboni driver and rivalry with Joan's talented daughter skater who hates Casey for no logical reason), Casey magically turns into a suberb Novice skater in just a few weeks and qualifies to the US National Championships.

Even if you never practiced this sport, you have to agree that the film is too dramatic, a cast of unappealing characters that hate each other with long stretches where nothing really happens with a super happy ending for all. Joan's character is both the most realistic character of the film and yet I couldn't understand why she accepted to train Casey who ends up being a threat to her talented daughter qualifying to the nationals. Many rinks have more than 1 coach that will focus on varying skill levels. I find it hard to believe Joan is the *only* teacher in town. It's a sad truth but coaches can and do have a preference towards accepting students based on the size of their wallets rather than skill level. It seems a bit far fetched that Casey easily convinces a coach that likely charges 100 USD for a 40 minute class to accept her so easily and then sticks around even when the coach ignores her over another much more advanced student.

Joan's acting was the highlight of the film, but the decision her character makes made me frown. The most realistic character was Joan's daughter who has managed to land a Double Axel and is apparently now a Junior but she hates the sport and wants to quit (but know her mother will freak out after investing so much time and money in her training). Had the daughter been the star character of the film, the movie would have made a whole lot of sense and been great.

Now, figure ice skating is an awesome sport, but there is an age limit to getting serious in it and reaching Senior level. Johnny Weir is one of the very few skaters that started getting serious at age 12 and reached the elite level. In my experience, male skaters with the right bone structure and height still have some leeway to get started fairly later in life whereas the singles is far less forgiving of later female bloomers. Doesn't mean that it is impossible for Tatiana Malinina reached her peak in her mid 20's but she had been into ballet whereas Casey didn't.

The exam to ""skipping"" to Novice in the film made me laugh. Sorry honey bunny, but the USFSA doesn't give participation trophies. You have to pass every exam in order whether you like it or not. You can pass more than 1 exam in the same test date but there is no way that someone can do 5 bunny hops and a Double Toe Loop and then be granted the Novice level patch. The movie infers that Casey magically passes the Novice level exam after a few weeks of practicing the sport and is already good to go for the Nationals. Nevermind you have to first pass the city competition and later on the regionals, let's just get to the finale!

The film does have some good moments but the focus of the film in my opinion should have been on Joan's daughter that wishes to quit the sport. As an already proven Junior skater, she would have given the dazzling jumps and coach/mother-drama we were awaiting and a still a great ending. She could have performed a fantastic reoutine at the nationals before she quits the sport to pursue other interests granting us the big show.",1514937600,,4068,4.5340599455040875
