This movie is an excellent piece of work, if  judged with that in mind.  The women are many and Hot, the situations are  funny and provocative, and the outfits are skimpy, revealing and  imaginative.  There are few movies in this genre that can top this one.  If  you are a fan, Don't hesitate to buy this flick!",953337600,18,486,4.482758620689655

7828044,3,6302622921,Start with the first Bikini Summer movie. It's the same movie only way better. You won't have to put up with some boring subplot about helping a couple of homeless people. That could have been a nice Disney movie but doesn't belong in Bikini Summer. And the first movie has more nudity - even a couple of full-frontal scenes. I think that gives an extra dimension to movies like this.,1222041600,5,384,4.5
7828045,3,6302622921,"this movie was good until the bob sagetish moral, meaning of life, message to the people or whatever u wanna call it came in the script.

it is like full house with nudity. if you're bored and wanna see some nudity, or girls from the early 90 in bikini. make your day.",1155427200,10,268,4.153846153846154

7828047,1,6302622921,"And it is chaotic, incomprehensible! Jessica Hahn, top billed is on display for about 90 seconds (you think she can act?) Everything else is chop suey, editing room out-jokes (the opposite of in-jokes), vapid, soft core, exploitation. This movie was made by people who know that a name in the news, and female nudity will separate a certain type (worldwide) from their cashola.",982972800,7,377,5.0
