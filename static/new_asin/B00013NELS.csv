8006211,4,B00013NELS,"Unlike many of the old TV shows Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis stand up well against todays shows.  I held off for two weeks before watching the episodes because I wanted to find a time when nothing better was on.  Once I popped them in my DVD I watched them all in one weekend.  The humor still made me laugh and the music still kept me spell bound.
As an added bonus, I noticed small glimpses of history, such as small hints of their fighting and Jerry's early fund raising for Muscular Dystrophy.
I only have one drawback to report.  These shows date back to before the time that TV camera angles changed every few seconds.  The skits sometimes seem to drag on about twice the length of modern skits.  This didn't bother me, but a person with pronounced ADHD might not sit through them as well.",1088467200,10,794,4.36734693877551
