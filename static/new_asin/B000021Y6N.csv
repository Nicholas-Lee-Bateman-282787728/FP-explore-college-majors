1248621,4,B000021Y6N,"I watched ""The Tender Trap"" as part of TMC's tribute to the late, great Debbie Reynolds.  It's a sweet little flick, but I found the performances of David Wayne and Celeste Holm superior to those of Reynolds and Frank Sinatra.  Debbie Reynolds was typecast as usual as the sweet ingenue, Sinatra as her selfish playboy boyfriend.  They do their best with their cardboard characters, but Wayne is much more sympathetic and interesting as the probably in a mid-life crisis and happily-married-but-bored vacationing friend.  He shows a heartfelt wisdom in the second half of the film that's moving and charming, and Celeste Holm equally so for the same reasons.

This is a good date-night or chick flick movie from Hollywood's golden era. Well worth a look.",1485907200,,754,5.0

Hard to say this film set women's rights back 100 years because it portrays a no nonsense woman who knows what she wants and won't settle for less. You do not see this type of behavior at ALL these days. Most women accept that men have a double standard and let them be treated like chattel. Maybe marriage, kids, and loving your husband is an antiquated goal in life but for some this film shows gumption.

I found the dialog witty and entertaining, the women most beautiful, and Frank's singing divine. I guess I am a big sucker for any project involving Debbie Reynolds, she is a mega talent. It all started when I first saw her in ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" and was mesmerized.

So even if you find this movie's message subservient, I found it uplifting and inspirational. Be strong with your aspirations and let those dogs lay sleeping. Whipit good DR!! haha",1447804800,,907,4.58641975308642

1248667,5,B000021Y6N,"I love this movie. I bought it for my mom, a Sinatra fan. I guess I'm a Sinatra fan because she played his albums all the time when I was little. Those Capitol albums from the 1950s were the best!

The Tender Trap stars Sinatra as Charlie, a music producer, who sings and has a swell bachelor pad. He has gorgeous women in and out, to walk his dog, bring him whitefish, cheese, sometimes just to neck. One of the girls is Sylvia, Celeste Holm, who plays in the NBC orchestra on live TV from Rockefeller Center. She is in love with Frank.
There's Julie, a young Debbie Reynolds, who wants to be in showbiz who auditions for Charlie's  show. She sings The Tender Trap, he tells her how to sing it better, sparks fly, they like each other.
Charlie's pal, Joe (played by the adorable David Wayne) comes to town saying he's left his wife back in the Midwest and wants to be a swinger like Charlie. When he meets Sylvia he's smitten.
There's the usual romantic comedy confusion, Charlie and Julie fight and make up. Joe tells Sylvia he loves her. It's old fashioned but it's got a great look and great actors.

1248710,4,B000021Y6N,"Happy Valentine's Day 2014!  Let's go back in time to explore love and marriage circa 1955 in ""The Tender Trap"", one of the first films to feature Frank Sinatra's swinging single persona.  This film is kind of an oddity, on the surface it's supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are some unsettling undercurrents.  The opening features a footloose and fancy free Frank Sinatra singing the very snappy and ingratiating title song by songwriters Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn.  He walks towards us framed against a background of puffy white clouds hung in an unlimited horizon of blue sky which I believe might signify the heavenly carefree bachelorhood he enjoys.

As the story unfolds, we're in the sleek Manhattan bachelor pad of Charlie Reader (Frank Sinatra) a successful 35 year old theatrical agent who seems to do quite well with the ladies.  He's introduced to the audience necking on his couch with the very attractive Poppy Matson (Lola Albright).  Their interlude is interrupted by the arrival of Joe's best friend since kindergarten Joe McCall (David Wayne) from Indianapolis.  Joe has been married for 11 years, and has 3 children.  Both his wife Ethel and he are unsettled and at a crossroads in their marriage.  With Ethel's blessing Joe is taking a sabbatical in New York City for several weeks staying with Charlie and taking care of some business with his company.  Both Ethel and he are hoping that absence will make the heart grow fonder and reinvigorate their life together.  Joe is astonished and envious at the parade of nubile females that seem to come and go at regular intervals in Charlie's apartment, besides Poppy prominently there are Jessica (Jarma Lewis), a Southern belle and Helen (Carolyn Jones) who walks Charlie's dog.  All three fuss and pamper Charlie in the hope of marrying him.  The one woman that catches Joe's eye is Charlie's ""special"" lady, Sylvia Crewes (Celeste Holm), a sophisticated, witty, elegant classical musician who also would like to land Charlie in the matrimonial net.  Despite Charlie's harem, he claims to admire Joe's marital state, while Joe is very tempted to trade places with Charlie.

At an audition for a Broadway musical Charlie, Joe and Sylvia meet Julie Gillis (Debbie Reynolds) a pretty 21 year old would be actress.  However Julie is not your usual show biz hopeful.  A theatrical career is only a stepping stone to kill time until Julie achieves her true goal, marriage within the next year.  She already has the date picked out to be at least engaged if not married by her parents' wedding anniversary, even though she hasn't even met the prospective groom as yet.  That doesn't deter her however, she firmly believes she will achieve her objective and single mindedly pursues it.  Charlie takes Julie out after her successful audition bringing along Joe and Sylvia.  As Julie reveals her future matrimonial plans, the trio are all appalled and bemused by her smug conviction she will succeed.  Oddly Charlie finds himself drawn to her and asks her to dinner, at first Julie rebuffs him since he doesn't fit her profile of a prospective husband.  Yet something changes Julie's mind and she pegs Charlie as her romantic prey and sets out to trap him.  She demands however that Charlie be exclusively hers, and he balks at the idea, even though he is falling in love with Julie. Concurrently, Joe and Sylvia start seeing each and start developing a close though not as yet romantic relationship.  Sylvia, though not as cold blooded in her approach and logic as Julie, also desires matrimony since she is nearing 33.  Since I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie, hopefully that's enough to tantalize and to find out what happens next.

""The Tender Trap"" is an apt title for this film and its skewed perspective of marriage.  Besides Julie and Sylvia,Poppy, Jessica & Helen,are aiming for the altar.  Yet the portrait of marriage presented in the movie is less than appealing for both men and women.  Joe doesn't seem very happy, & doesn't seem to miss his wife Ethel or their children.  Ethel admits to being ""restless and bored"" In a phone conversation with Joe, and as an antidote is looking to carpet their bathroom!  In the brief glimpse we have of Ethel in a family photo of Joe's, she's somber and matronly, and appears as if she is at least 10 years Joe's senior.  The double portrait of Julie's parents show two glum, resigned individuals, with Julie's mother dumpy and dowdy again looking like the elder of the two of them. At one point Joe says to Sylvia that there are worse things for a woman than being single, but when Sylvia puts him on the spot and says name three, he's silent.  Both seem to feel that a bad marriage for a woman will be better than no marriage at all, which of course is ludicrous.  This viewpoint  along with Julie's willingness to forsake a promising career in show business at the ripe old age of twenty two to rush pell-mell into marriage and motherhood will probably make today's woman wince.  At no point is it ever suggested that Julie and Sylvia might continue their careers after they say ""I do!""  It seems like it's an either or proposition, marriage or career, but not both.

While I have a soft spot for cinema ingnues in romantic comedies as a rule, Debbie Reynolds Julie Gillis is possibly the most exasperating, irritating example of this role in film history.  This is not really Ms. Reynolds fault but rather the way the character is written in the screenplay by Julius J. Epstein. Julie is arrogant, scheming, bossy, nosy, inconsiderate, prim and self-righteous.  It's next to impossible to feel any sympathy or empathy or to root for her happiness.  I found it difficult to fathom why Charlie would prefer her over the warm, delightful Sylvia.  Julie is pretty in a well-scrubbed way, but has minimal charm or depth.  With her preplanned life she's already decided on how many children and where they will live (Scarsdale, big surprise there!) the poor fella she captures is going to have a pretty dreary existence.  This is my least favorite performance by Debbie Reynolds; fortunately she would redeem herself the next year in an outstanding breakout dramatic performance in ""The Catered Affair"".

Sinatra's Charlie Reader is also a cypher, a little boy that never grew up.  He seems to like all the many women that want to capture him more for what they can do for him, i.e. more as mothers than as lovers.  Like Julie, he has a preconceived notion of what he would like in a spouse, an image curiously enough that is (so he says anyway) more like Sylvia than Julie.  Charlie admires marriage as something that is fine for his best buddy Joe, but something he's not ready for personally.  What finally pushes him towards an engagement is his insecurity at finding himself not able to get a date from his usually adoring coterie of ladies.  However if Julie and he tie the knot one can only shudder at the train wreck their marriage will be down the road.

The truly intriguing characters are the secondary couple Joe and Sylvia.  This could be because they are more mature and realistic than Charlie and Julie, or that their characters are better written.  It could also be that David Wayne and Celeste Holm are better actors.  This is the couple that I wound up rooting for to end up together, even though they probably won't.  Ms. Holm's Sylvia is beguiling, bright, and lovely with a wry sense of humor, no man in his right mind would choose the mechanical Julie over her.  With his trademark brush cut and low keyed demeanor, David Wayne's Joe has an ingratiating manliness as contrasted with the juvenile Charlie.

Lola Albright, Jarma Lewis and Carolyn Jones all have their amusing moments as Poppy, Jessica and Helen.  Charles Walters a skillful director of musicals such as ""Easter Parade"" and ""Lili"" among others does a nice job keeping the action moving.  There's a nice touch at the movie's end when Sinatra is joined by Reynolds, Holm and Wayne against the endless blue sky for a reprise of the title song, and a chance for the quartet to take a bow.

This is a curiosity piece, but is still enjoyable and diverting to watch.  However for the ladies it certainly will prove the adage you've come a long way baby!  As for the gents, thank your lucky stars that hopefully you haven't or won't wind up snagged in ""the tender trap"" with a predator like Julie!",1392336000,,8408,4.755172413793104

The other scene of him demonstrating how to sing the song while his co-star Debbie Reynolds watches, is also evidence of how great a singer and actor he was.

His old buddy (David Wayne) comes for a visit, having temporarily tired of married life, and has fun with one of Charlie's girls played by Celeste Holm. A young singer (Debbie Reynolds) catches Charlie's eye, but she's prim and proper and set on marriage.

Sinatra was a huge star and icon of all things hip and sexy in 1955. He's wonderful in the movie; unfortunately, the script isn't. Originally a play, the characters still politely take turns giving overly-witty speeches and it looks and sounds like a staged play (the stars even take a curtain call at the end). Holm and Wayne, as the second-tier stars and comic relief, reliably play their usual smart aleck characters but the act grows old fast. Reynolds, nearly half Sinatra's age, has the allure of a Brownie Scout; there's absolutely no chemistry between the two and their romance never rings true.

Fans of Sinatra will enjoy his cool and sensuous performance, but the story needed more music than the oft-sung title song and a more realistic script. It's dated and silly but still harmless 50's fun. 2.5 stars.",1320710400,2,1183,4.880597014925373

1248735,4,B000021Y6N,"Here's Frankie at the apex of his swingin' Fifties movie fame in THE TENDER TRAP (1955), a fun romantic comedy which pairs him with darling Debbie Reynolds and also boasts the strong comedic support of David Wayne and Celeste Holm.

New York talent agent Charlie Reader (Frank Sinatra) lives a charmed life.  His bachelor pad is serviced by an endless parade of beautiful girls (including Carolyn Jones, Lola Albright and Jarma Lewis) ready to cater to his every whim.  What more could a man want?  Certainly not marriage!  But his latest discovery, stage singer Julie Gillis (Debbie Reynolds) couldn't care less about her career if a wedding's not on the immediate horizon.  Whether he likes it or not, Charlie's about to be caught in the 'tender trap'...

While Sinatra and Reynolds were the top-billed stars of THE TENDER TRAP, the film is mercilessly stolen by David Wayne and Celeste Holm's snappy supporting performances.  Indeed, Holm made such an impression that she and Sinatra were reunited the following year in ""High Society"".  Debbie Reynolds' character of Julie might rankle female viewers in the modern age, but she gives a delightful performance--given the limitations of the script.  Frankie and David have some great scenes together and the whole affair breezes along in splendid fashion.  A fun title.

The DVD includes a featurette focusing on Sinatra's attempt to reinvent his movie persona in the 1950s, plus the trailer.

1248738,4,B000021Y6N,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sugary piece of 1950s nostalgia.

The boyish charm of the 1940s had mellowed, and Sinatra was looser, more comfortable in his own skin, and positively oozing a rakish charm. Oh he could be nice and respectable, but there was more of an edge to the man during this phase of his career that can be seen even in a lightweight vehicle such as this. The moment when Sinatra's character, Charlie, realizes that without Julie his swingin' single life amounts to absolutely nothing actually comes off rather poignantly. Debbie Reynolds plays Julie with aplomb - at this stage in Reynolds' career I don't think anyone could play an ingenue with such fierce tenacity better. The supporting actors are real gems. David Wayne plays Charlie's married best friend Joe, who after eleven years of marriage envies Charlie's carefree life - at first (in fact his character reminds me just a bit of the Tom Ewell character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seven-Year-Itch/dp/B000JF5TXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seven Year Itch</a>). The fabulous Celeste Holm plays (one of) Charlie's long-suffering girlfriends, Sylvia. Holm effortlessly dances between comic relief and bittersweet world-weariness - but her character gets a sweet payoff in the end!  The movie's biggest drawback is it's ""stagey"" feel. Based on a play, the film feels like you're basically watching a stage version, with the main set being Charlie's sprawling, fabulously retro apartment. One is definitely an observer and not as fully ""immersed"" in the world of the film as you could be if it was filmed differently. However, I think some of the timelessness of the relationship humor outweighs the staging of the film. Also, the title song gets about beaten to death, but thankfully it's endured as a classic and risen about the unnecessary multiple versions here.  As far as the DVD goes, the picture quality is crisp & clear and the colors are vibrant, and unlike most of the other DVDs in the Frank Sinatra Collection, this one includes a ""Frank in the Fifties"" featurette - it's about fifteen minutes or so in length, but it's a nice overview of this phase of Sinatra's career.

- Charlie: ""Thanks a lot.""
- Julie: ""But I can't have dinner with every nice, attractive man I meet. It's not part of my plan.""
- Charlie: ""How's that plan again?""
- Julie: ""My marriage plan.""

Frank Sinatra plays New York theater agent and swingin' bachelor Charlie Y. Reader, whose tryst with a hottie is interrupted by his sarcastic, longtime pal Joe from Indianapolis, who pays him a visit and then becomes a house guest (he'd just left his wife, Ethel, you see?). When Joe marvels at the series of beautiful dames Frank sees (""Where do all these tomatoes come from?""), Frank tells him, ""Sure, it's fun. But let's face it...I would be happy to trade this rat race for your set-up in two seconds."" Turns out Frank is weary of the fast lane and longs for domesticated bliss - if only he could find the right girl. One candidate seems to be Sylvia Crewes (Celeste Holm), a sexy, sophisticated fiddle-player.

But, then, in comes 21-year-old aspiring actress Julie Gillis (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Charlie is instantly attracted. But Julie is uptight, rigid and exacting, with definite, long-conceived plans for marriage. And, no, she doesn't at all buy what Charlie's selling. That is, until, he sings a song. Then, of course, she's butter.

So Charlie and Julie start keeping company, with Sylvia then being perenially stood up and Joe going out with her as Charlie's stand-in. Anyway, for Charlie and Julie, the usual events unfold, a bit of wooing followed by a big spat, leading up to a traumatized Charlie somehow proposing marriage to both Julie and Sylvia on the same night.

Oh, yes. Meanwhile, the still-married Joe has fallen hard for Sylvia. How ever do these wacky things happen?

Put me down as someone who finds THE TENDER TRAP a charming and enjoyable movie. It's a breezy, lightweight, metropolitan sex comedy, for all that it's material that would probably be PG rated today (this is very tame stuff compared to more contemporary films). I've always liked how this film started, with Ol' Blue Eyes as a tiny figure on the horizon, casually strolling towards the camera and singing the title song as only he can (""You see a pair of laughing eyes...""). MGM released THE TENDER TRAP in 1955, and it turned out to be one of the first films to revamp Frank's screen image from a perenially shy crooner who loved his love from afar to a hip ladies' man who doesn't waste time getting close to his dames.

The cast is very nice. We all know Frank Sinatra and what he brings to the table; he's so relaxed and cool that he makes me want to be a womanizing heel (and armed with Charlie Reader's favorite come-on line - ""You are the softest girl"" - how can I lose?). Frank gets a good sidekick in David Wayne, who's very good as the level-headed Joe McCall (even if Joe's going thru a mid-life crisis). Wayne drops his share of one-liners and even makes a serious bid for one of Frank's girls.

Pretty Debbie Reynolds was personally riding high around this time, about to marry warbler Eddie Fisher. As Julie, she really makes that prim and proper act work, while showing glimpses of a softer, more vulnerable side. But I couldn't help but root for Celeste Holm's character, who is pragmatic yet wistful, mature yet ever so sexy. Her Sylvia may be a suave and cosmopolitan career woman, but, deep down, she wants the same things that Julie wants, which is a family of her own. Her bittersweet speech to David Wayne (about the lean prospects of a woman of 33) may just have been the best acting moment in this movie. For those who may have pulled for Sylvia and Charlie to get together, no worries. They kind of do, even if it's in another film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Society/dp/B00008AOWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Society</a>). But even in this movie, Celeste ends up doing pretty well, successfully pulling off her own ""tender trap.""

For those expecting a bunch of songs, well, don't. THE TENDER TRAP is very much a comedy, and not a musical. But if you like the title song, then the good news is that it's reprised five times, with Frank doing the opening honors and then performing it again halfway thru (in the second version, his talent for phrasing really shines thru). Debbie does a breezy version and then, later, sings it with more feeling. And the four stars sing a brief rendition at the end. It's a good song, so no surprise that ""The Tender Trap"" would become a standard and a fixture in Frank's song repertoire.

I say, three and a half stars for THE TENDER TRAP. The sexual mores may be dated, and the jargon not so hip anymore, but the movie's still very much worth checking out. As a fan of Frank, I definitely feel that his presence elevates the picture, although the contributions of the other actors shouldn't be discounted.

You know, on second thought, I think I'll pass on that one pick-up line. I think only someone like Frank can pull off something as cheesy as ""You're the softest girl.""",1204848000,21,5183,4.74250832408435
1248752,4,B000021Y6N,"Set in the world of 1950s show business, THE TENDER TRAP tells the love story of Charlie Reader (Frank Sinatra), a 40-something bachelor theater agent and Julie Gillis (Debbie Reynolds), a 21 year-old ingenue who, six months after graduation, is cast in her first play.

To the naked eye, the main characters have nothing in common.  Charlie is a playboy with all the toys and playthings that come with life in 1950s Manhattan. His bachelor pad is well appointed for casual romance.  With an expansive view of the Brooklyn Bridge, a cozy sofa and a well-stocked bar, his apartment attracts what seems like a never-ending parade of gorgeous young starlets - much to the amusement of his married, hometown friend, Joe McCall (David Wayne), who is visiting during a rough time in his own marriage.

Julie, on the other hand, is determined to end her single life - precisely on the same calendar day her mother married at 22.  Completely uninterested in scrawny, aimless Charlie and signing the acting contract that will keep her working beyond March 12th when she plans to marry, Julie is not a ""sure thing"" to say the least.

What happens next is perhaps formulaic in the grand tradition of old Hollywood films.  Still TENDER TRAP is a terrific movie that I recommend highly to women looking for mindless entertainment.  Plus, in a supporting role, Celeste Holm does a great job playing the quintessential 33 year old Manhattan woman, who seems as real today, in the aftermath of ""Sex & the City,"" as she was 50 years ago.

As for the film itself, all you really need to know is that Sinatra is the New York bachelor, still playing the field into his thirties.  Reynolds is dead-set on getting married: she has a deadline picked out, among other things.  Sinatra goes after Reynolds.
While at first I found Reynolds' character to be over the top, the scene in which she's scouting out her future home decorations sold me.  She's eccentric, but once she finds her man she nestles right in.  Sinatra is right at home in the role, of course.
As to the plot, it does drag, but I think the only thing this film is guilty of is treating the issues it brings up with respect.  Naturally, it all comes to the climactic conflict, and I applaud The Tender Trap for not sweeping it out of the viewer's mind as cleanly as another light-hearted film might.  The characters are in a mess, and the innocent (or foolish) stand to get hurt.  The film takes the time to resolve each of their situations admirably.  It's not the swiftest wrap-up, but I think it pays off for the patient.

I'm afraid that, today, this movie will be misunderstood.  People will see it as another dumb Sinatra Swinging-Guy movie with a hep little tune thrown in.  You gotta read between the lines with this one:  consider the Debbie Reynolds character.  She says things like  ""A woman just isn't FULFILLED until she's married and has children, dontcha think?""  Her character has a promising career as a stage singer, but will throw it away toot-sweet just as soon as she can find herself a husband.  In fact, her single-minded, frenzied ambition for landing a hubby should send up the red flags for you.  The screenwriters, in their own frenzy of sarcasm, have created a terrifying figure in the chillingly perky frame of Miss Reynolds.  Jeepers, she even goes to some sort of Homemakers Convention, sizing up the appliances and furniture, husband-hunting in the weirdest way I've ever seen in a movie -- she has several men sit in a easy chair, trying to discern WHICH man best  ""fits in""  with the furniture she's fond of.  Uh, the message is pretty loud and clear!
Sinatra's buddy from Indianapolis, the not-coincidentally named Joe  (the typical American Shmo, 50's style), loves his wife of eleven years so much that he decides to shack up with Sinatra's Charlie for TWO WEEKS, to do . . . what?  Figure it out.  This Joe guy, played by David Wayne, is the probably the key to the whole picture, and is certainly contrasted with marriage-and-babies-crazy Debbie Reynolds.  We see the results of a good Fifties marriage:  Joe hides out, drinking and smoking like a maniac in his swinger-friend's sleazy apartment, whining about his wife's love of wall-to-wall carpeting and the cost of the kids'  braces.  He begins dating one of the swinger's girlfriends, Sylvia  (brilliantly played by Celeste Holm).  This Family Man proposes to Sylvia near the end of the picture  (she talks him out of it).  The hypocrite will return home to his wife in Indianapolis, who will never know how close her husband came to abandoning her.  Getting the idea?  Sylvia's another key character:  in a startling monologue directed at Joe, she talks about how a woman is washed up by the age of 33.  There are no available men left  (thanks to the emasculating Reynolds types who circle guys like a pride of sharks), and those who are available are nutcases working on their fifth divorce, 19-year-olds looking for Mamas, etc.  It's yet another depressing, scathing, indictment of what was going on culturally.
Another great scene is when Sinatra and Reynolds are alone at her parents'  apartment.  They turn on TV, and watch a bathing couple make out.  Panting, Ms. Reynolds switches off the set and opens what she hopes will be a dull art book, which turns out to contain sexy Raphaelite prints.  She slams the book closed, only to see a married couple make out from the apartment across the way.  Aroused, Sinatra puts the make on her, and she tells him that the other couple have the  ""right""  to do that, because of their state of grace as a married couple.  Predictably, the scene ends in a big fight, which is the only way these horribly repressed people can release all their pent-up hormones.
Invaluable as a study of 1950's attitudes toward sex and marriage, *The Tender Trap*  will surprise you.  It was the Good Old Days . . . and certain moviemakers were none too happy about it.  Fascinating.",986342400,19,3633,4.790322580645161

Hot Toasty Rag, September 15, 2017

Besides the title song, The Tender Trap doesnt have much going for it. Frank Sinatra plays a playboy bachelor, and David Wayne, a family man, envies his lifestyle. One day, David leaves his wife and children and decides hes going to live the life too. While he becomes infatuated with Franks current squeeze, Celeste Holme, Frank is left to play around with aspiring actress Debbie Reynolds. Only, Debbie is a very good girl; she won't take any love-em-and-leave-em behavior.

I was never a Debbie Reynolds fan; she always seemed enormously insincere and amateur. If the king of all bachelors is going to be hooked in by somebody, shed better be worth itand I have a hard time believing Debbie Reynolds is worth it. Its pretty dated, with lots of jokes about mens view of death by marriage, and won't really appeal to modern women.
