Excellent cast. We get the life in a boarding school.",1243814400,,294,5.104166666666667
8268830,5,B00188KD14,"I loved this movie! It is fun to watch. Emma Roberts, niece of Julia Roberts, does a wonderful job as the ""Wild Child"" main character. And as a double treat, Natasha Richardson, as the head mistress of a prestigious English boarding school, also does a superb job. This is the last movie Natasha Richardson acted in before her untimely death at the ski slopes. Definitely worth seeing. (May God rest your soul, dear Natasha! You were always a treat to watch, beit live theatre or DVD. Will always keep your husband and 2 sons in my prayers. The world is a better place having had you in it.)",1243382400,,591,4.481481481481482
