8313536,2,B001JQHT3A,"This DVD was advertised as a new one. One disk was misplaced in the box and was scratched.
The other dick was secure in the box, but it was scratched as well.
And I purchased the DVD as a new company sealed item.
Very disappointed.",1426204800,,231,4.155555555555556
8313537,2,B001JQHT3A,"I had hoped to learn some basic French, but this is definitely for people who already know quite a bit of it. I could see this being helpful as a refresher, but not for a beginner. I shall continue my search.",1355356800,2,208,4.097560975609756
8313538,1,B001JQHT3A,My one star comes from the fact that I was looking for something to help me with conversation but had the english subtitles that I could follow along to know what was happening in the conversations.  This is all in french with french subtitles.  Not very helpful for a person like me trying to relearn french.  This is more for a person who is some what already fluent in french and needs help with conversations.  Not a total waste but won't be able to use if for a while.,1296259200,7,473,4.280898876404494
8313539,4,B001JQHT3A,"This DVD apparently reproduces a popular educational television program created several years ago, judging by the cars, computers, and the money - they still use francs instead of Euros. It is not designed for children or true beginners. There are no basics in this DVD. Conversations begin with no grammar instruction, and the pace is fast. There was no booklet in the DVD case, and the website link was not helpful. There was no English-French Glossary as advertised on the box. All that said, this is a nice series of conversations, and an interesting virtual visit to Paris. This is good supplemental material for someone who wants to improve listening and reading skills. If you have been using Rosetta Stone, this would be an excellent choice as a supplement for functional life situations. Pair this video with other products that give grammar instruction.",1246492800,18,863,5.041958041958042
8313540,4,B001JQHT3A,When we lived in France Victor was broadcast on TV.  This series was a key part of our fairly successful effort to learn to communicate effectively in France.  We have ordered this first issue to review the basics but hope the more advanced lessons will soon become available.,1232582400,7,276,4.729166666666667
