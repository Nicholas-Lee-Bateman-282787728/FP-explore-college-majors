540155,4,6303039243,"this hal roach studios dvd release of 'second chorus' has to be the best restoration of this film so far.  not top of the line spectacular, but very, very good!!  on the back cover it says the dvd is ""mastered from original 35mm nitrate camera negative"", and indeed the images are clean and crisp, no spots, specs, or lines.  those who have seen the inferior prints of this film in the past will be pleasantly surprised.  it's well worth the money.

for me, astaire is hollywood royalty; a peerless dancer and entertainer.  all of astaire's body of work is great --- he never fails to deliver fresh, original interpretations of music through his singing and dancing.  his films should be in every dvd library, that's why THIS DVD EDITION is such a find.

and while the film itself is not a classic, it does have some wonderful moments, starting with the toe-tapping tune by the artie shaw orchestra that accompanies the opening credits.  this, along with  ""i ain't hep to that step but i'll dig it""  and  ""love of my life""  and the instrumental band music ... they're all upbeat, peppy tunes.  it's a shame there's not more of them, they're just great to listen to.

paulette goddard's sweet-tart personality also works well with astaire, and her one dance (a jitterbug!!) with astaire is well done and fun to watch.  again, we could use more dancing, even the great astaire has ONE solo dance number.  goddard herself was just reaching fullblown stardom at this time (1940).  burgess meredith, brilliant as always.  artie shaw, charles butterworth and the supporting cast, excellent.

with more music and dance numbers  (this film seems to have fewer numbers than your traditional musical), and perhaps better production values (paramount studios would do better by astaire in later films) this could have been a classic musical.  but even so, as it is , it's still well worth a look!!!!",1161561600,28,1888,4.798136645962733

540334,5,6303039243,"SECOND CHORUS [1940] [Blu-Ray + DVD] Transferred From an Original Fine Grain 35mm Print!

In only his second film after ending his legendary partnership with Ginger Rogers in 1939, that Fred Astaire returned to the screen in the frothy big band musical, `Second Chorus.' Fred Astaire described this effort as ""The worst film I ever made."" Fred Astaire admitted that he was attracted to the film by the opportunity to ""dance-conduct this real swingin' outfit.""

Excited about the opportunity to work with legendary big band leader Artie Shaw, Fred Astaire signed on for this romp co-starring Burgess Meredith and a winning Paulette Goddard. Shenanigans abound. Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith play friendly rivals musicians who purposely flunk their college courses in order to maintain lucrative jobs as college band leaders, but the real attraction, of course, lies in Fred Astaire's musical numbers.

With lyrics by legendary Johnny Mercer [""Dream"" and ""Moon River""] and music by both Hal Borne [Fred Astaire's rehearsal pianist] and Artie Shaw. Second Chorus received an Academy Award nominations for Best Song [""Would You Like to Be the Love of My Life?""] and Best Score. But it's the film's terrific final number, ""Poor Mr. Chisholm,"" that's the real award winner, especially with Fred Astaire whirling through a non-stop out sensational tap, while simultaneously conducting Artie Shaw's top of the line big-band, proof yet again of Fred Astaire's unquestioned status as the greatest dancer in Hollywood history.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: A notably lacklustre vehicle for Fred Astaire [Danny O'Neill], Paulette Goddard [Ellen Miller], and band leader Artie Shaw. `Second Chorus' [1940] was a Paramount release that's since fallen into public domain and released in this case by Hal Roach Studios. Fred Astaire and pal/rival Burgess Meredith [Hank Taylor] are unusually grating and there's a surprising dearth of singing and especially dancing. Having spent nearly a decade making films with Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire in 1940 was ready to try something new. ""At this point"" he wrote, ""I decided that one picture a year was all I should make. With so much preparation necessary, it was really all I could do to get even that much done....It took seven to eight months and sometimes more to complete one of my films. Each one seemed to get increasingly difficult. More dances and musical sequences crept into them as we went along, mainly because the audiences wanted it that way. Next on the slate for me was Second Chorus [1940].

Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith are overage college students and swing trumpeters Danny O'Neill and Hank Taylor, respectively, and that's the joke: they keep avoiding graduation so as to continue to rake in dough booking on-campus gigs. Still, it's a little hard to accept Fred Astaire was old enough in 1940 to be two college students.

When Danny O'Neill sees an old pal Stu [Frank Melton] turn up with pretty Ellen Miller [Paulette Goddard] under his arm, she instantly falls for Danny O'Neill, or so it seems. In one of the picture's few clever ideas, she passes under the table what he thinks is her phone number. Actually it's a summons to appear in court; she's a secretary for a collection agency.

With Hank Taylor equally enamoured of Ellen Miller, the troublesome pair instantly get her fired from her job so they can hire her on as their secretary manager. Later, when she's hired away by bandleader Artie Shaw, they create so many problems for her that she nearly loses that job, too. Part of the problem is that Danny O'Neill and Hank Taylor want a shot at joining Artie Shaw's band, but they're even more fiercely competitive over their careers than they are with Ellen Miller and only end up pissing off the bandleader. Ellen Miller eventually convinces rich and eccentric bottle cap magnate J. Lester Chisholm [Charles Butterworth] to finance a special concert headlined by Artie Shaw, but Danny O'Neill and Hank Taylor nearly wreck that, too.

In many of Fred Astaire's musicals, he tries to win the girl by essentially pestering her to death, wearing her down to the point of stalking her until she finally gives in and sees what a swell guy he is. This is taken to the next level in `Second Chorus.' Danny O'Neill and Hank Taylor are so insufferably juvenile, that by the end you want to slug 'em. Oblivious to Ellen Miller's position, they single-mindedly sabotage the other with no consideration of the consequences. Hank scribbles some off-key notes onto Danny O'Neill's sheet music, ruining his audition with Artie Shaw, while Danny O'Neill knocks Hank Taylor right off the bandstand in the middle of his performance. If all the musicians in Artie Shaw's band were anything like these two jokers, it's no wonder Artie Shaw retired so suddenly at the peak of his powers, turning his back on show business forever. In truth, `Second Chorus' was indeed Artie Shaw's last Hollywood film, partly because of his frustrations with director H.C. Potter. Potter kept arguing that Artie Shaw was playing his character all wrong until Shaw, in utter frustration, reportedly stormed off the set yelling, ""You idiot, I'm playing myself!""

Artie Shaw was riding high in 1940. He had had a huge hit in 1938 with ""Begin the Beguine"" and he and his band were in demand. His musical collaborator on the film was legendary lyricist Johnny Mercer. Among the songs Johnny Mercer and Artie Shaw would write for the film was `Love of My Life.' As John Mueller wrote in his book ""Astaire Dancing: The Musical Films of Fred Astaire"" according to Artie Shaw, they had agreed to do a song called ""Love of My Life."" They finished the song in about a day but waited three weeks to show it to the studio executives. As the experienced Johnny Mercer explained to the bewildered bandleader, ""If you bring a song right in, the movie people don't place any value on it.""

The grating characterisations would be less an issue if Fred Astaire had been allotted the number and size of musical numbers with which he had become accustomed. Instead, there's hardly any significant singing and dancing in the film at all. Fred Astaire and Paulette Goddard do a pretty good duet of the Borne-Mercer ""(I Ain't Hep To That Step But I'll) Dig It,"" but that's about it. The film is really more a vehicle for Artie Shaw, though in the film we see less of him than Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith pretending to play the trumpet (they're dubbed by Bobby Hackett and Billy Butterfield). In one scene Fred Astaire pretends to be Russian while singing Artie Shaw's ""Would You Like to Be the Love of My Life,"" but even here his voice is mostly dubbed by musical director and, as it turned out, real-life Soviet spy, Boris Morros. I guess Fred Astaire should consider himself lucky they didn't get someone else to do his dancing, too. Artie Shaw's okay in what amounts to the fourth lead; he's certainly a better actor than any of the other bandleaders of the time, including Glenn Miller who concurrently starred in several 20th Century Fox pictures. (One should try to catch The Fabulous Dorseys, if only for the hysterically awful acting of both Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey). Billy Butterworth gives the film it's only real charm.

Fred Astaire wouldn't place any value on Second Chorus and although he had kind words for the film in his autobiography, he also referred to it as the worst film he ever made. Part of the problem lay in the story, which was being rewritten even as it was being shot. The story of two battling trumpet players (played by Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith) was flimsy and only served to hold the film together in between musical numbers. Another problem, as Fred Astaire would discover, was that Paulette Goddard was not an experienced dancer. ""Paulette Goddard was a swell sport about the dance we did together. She had not done any dancing to speak of up to that point, except in the chorus some few years previously, as she told me. We worked hard on that little thing called ""Dig It"" and I thought it turned out fine. After the number was finished and she had seen it on film, she remarked, ""I know one thing, I loved it!"" Privately, he would say, ""She's a lovely girl, with a breath-taking figure, who couldn't dance and somehow resisted every attempt to break down her handicap."" Paulette Goddard later remembered, the number was shot all in one take ""just once, one Saturday morning...I'm glad it was all right for I couldn't have done it again!""

Paulette Goddard may not have enjoyed dancing with Fred Astaire, but she obviously enjoyed working with Burgess Meredith. While filming `Second Chorus' in 1940, Paulette Goddard was separated from her husband Charlie Chaplin. After her divorce she would then go onto marry Burgess Meredith in 1944.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `Second Chorus' is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Film Chest Inc. with an encoded 1080p transfer in an aspect ratio of 1.34:1. Film Chest continues to use some odd, potentially ambiguous, phrasing with regard to its Blu-ray releases. Emblazoned across the cover of Second Chorus is the statement ""transferred from an original fine grain 35mm print."" Do they mean a master positive? Then on the back we're offered another clue: ""scanned and restored from a 35mm fine grain into 2K (transfer sourced from nitrate),"" which would seem to point to a relatively lowly print and not any intermediate element (despite the emphasis on ""fine grain""), as should probably be expected of a public domain title. Film Chest has come in for some considerable vitriol from its fans. The clean-up work done here is quite remarkable, with only a few transitory scratches and a couple of hairs in the gate (some on stock establishing footage) remaining. This is a nice (maybe even a big) step in the right direction for Film Chest Inc. It can't be easy to source these titles very well, and often these niche labels are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they do nothing, the transfer ends up looking too shoddy for high definition consumers. If they do too much, they're accused of wiping the slate clean, so to speak. Making matters worse is the transfer, allegedly ""mastered from the original 35mm nitrate camera negative"" but so soft and with such weak blacks as to suggest that the 25-year-old transfer looks like it is dating back to the early days of VHS.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Yikes! Two steps forward, one pretty big step backward. What have they done to Fred Astaire's song? The Second Chorus' original mono track is presented via 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono, and while it's commendable that Film Chest Inc. has gone the mono track route with this release (they haven't always done that), some aspiring audio engineer has processed this track to within an inch of its life. This is of course is ironic, considering the criticism this label has come in for with regard to its processing of the visuals. But I am wondering if some of this is due to an attempt to create a fake stereo mix, with phasing between the channels, though I personally detected absolutely no stereo separation here. This same problem makes a lot of the dialogue sound overly boxy and over reverbed. The high end fares best here, which is at least good news for some of Artie Shaw's stratospheric clarinet work, but this is a real shame, especially since `Second Chorus' contains such fabulous music.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Tom Santopietro: This is a generally interesting and informative commentary, though Tom Santopietro has the odd habit of repeatedly introducing someone or something and then telling us ""I'll talk more about that later,"" very strange.

Theatrical Trailer [1940] [2:06] This is yet another faux trailer, something that Film Chest Inc. inexplicably does on a lot of their releases. What makes these so very, very odd trailers, unlike most films, are almost always in the public domain, so using the real trailer (even if it weren't restored) would seem to be pretty easy.

Original Movie Art Postcard

Finally, `Second Chorus' may not in fact be top tier Fred Astaire, but even second tier is usually head and shoulders (not to mention dancing feet) above the bulk of ""all singing, all dancing"" films that were such regular offerings back in the thirties and forties. Sadly, though, `Second Chorus' fell into the public domain and then into very bad disrepair, something even a lesser Fred Astaire effort like this didn't deserve. Film Chest has done a largely laudable visual restoration here, one that artfully balances a fairly aggressive scrubbing with an effort not to totally wipe the film of grain. Unfortunately, someone also tried to ""improve"" the audio and failed pretty miserably. The result is a mixed bag. Astaire lovers may well want to check this out; as it's certainly the nicest `Second Chorus' has looked for decades and despite it not being one of Fred Astaire's best musical escapades. Again, Fred Astaire regarded `Second Chorus' ""as the worst film of his career"" and he may just be right. It's not awful, but terribly misguided. Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith play irritating musicians that don't engender much sympathy, and Fred Astaire hardly gets to dance at all. Despite this I am still glad I have this in my Blu-ray Collection. Recommended!

I have been a collector of films, videos, and DVDs for a long time and I fail to remember when I have seen such a dismal attempt at restoring a film by choosing a second or third generation print that has already been mangled though a projector and probably stomped upon by a frustrated projectionist who had to rip the worn and torn film from the projector's gate.

The main reason I did not give it a five star is a personal preference - I am not too fond of folks 'doing the dirty trick behind one's back' which The two main guys do all thru the show. It does give for some good laughs/chuckles (I just don't like anyone doing that in life, movie script or no!) Yet as stated, gives comedy and it is the script for the story.

Since all of them had already scored quite considerable successes, with Astaire and Shaw in particular having achieve truly stellar heights, how they ended up participating in this very minor, not very adept piece of light moviemaking is a mystery.  If you love Fred Astaire and Artie Shaw, you will want to see it, and they (along with the others mentioned, and Charles Butterworth) do not completely fail to provided amusement, but you will be painfully embarrassed on their behalf to see them trapped in a project so far beneath their talents.

540421,1,6303039243,"Alpha Video is one of those companies that copies film-based movies directly to DVD with no digital remastering of either the video or audio. As a result, the video jumped at times and spots blinked across the screen. Most of the dialogue sounded like people talking inside a large tin can lined with acoustic insulation.

The plot and characters did not age very well. It may have been funny at one time, but having two friends, O'Neill and Taylor (played by Fred Astaire and Burgess Meredith, respectively) lying and conniving against each other for the motives of lust and greed made the entire movie disappointing. Even the one sympathetic character, Mr. Chisholm (played by Charles Butterworth) got drawn into this ""comic"" device when he decided to use his position as concert sponsor to force his unwanted musical abilities on Artie Shaw.

Paulette Goddard's character Ellen Miller did women a disservice by pretending to put her foot down when she had an opportunity to display common sense and tell the two ""friends"" she did not want to see them again, after they used her friendship to gain auditions with Shaw and then embarrassed her with their unprofessional antics onstage. Instead, she keeps letting them get her into trouble, almost causing Chisholm to return home with his sponsorship money by making him think Ellen was married to Taylor. They finally almost see the error of their ways and put their lying and conniving to good use by convincing Chisholm that their latest scam was all a misunderstanding and persuading him to recommit to the concert.

Adding to the disappointment is the fact that Astaire had only two dance numbers, one with Goddard (she's no Ginger Rogers) and a solo dance at the end of the movie.

It sort of comes out okay in the end, but the idea that a woman's love can make a bad guy turn good has resulted in many women choosing to remain in abusive and even lethal relationships. Sorry, but I don't find this to be a very valuable theatrical device anymore. At least ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" did not pretend to be other than what it was.

540423,4,6303039243,"""Second Chorus"" is not a widely known film, but it will probably be enjoyable to any fan of Fred Astaire. If you're not particularly fond of Astaire, you might want to pass on this one since seeing Astaire in action in an unusual role is the main attraction. The story is that Danny O'Neill (Fred Astaire) and Hank Taylor (Burgess Meredith) are leaders of a band. The two have been intentionally failing in college, because they like the atmosphere, and also because as long as they are officially students they can spend their time running the band and making a pretty good living at it. When Ellen Miller (Paulette Goddard) enters the picture, they both get greedy and want her attention for themselves. Thus they each double-cross the other and both wind up getting expelled from the university, thus ending their cozy arrangement with their band. They spend most of the rest of the film continuing to double-cross one another, this time over trying to get into Artie Shaw's band as well as trying to win over the affections of Ellen, who now works for Shaw. In the end, Danny and Hank patch things up and decide to work together, with good results coming from their teamwork.

The things that are not so great about this film are mainly the quality of the video, the less than great comic timing, and the tiresome scenes with J. Lester Chisholm, played by Charles Butterworth. Mr. Butterworth is no Edward Everett Horton, and as a less-than-adequate character actor you just want to shoo the guy off stage every time he turns up. Also, if you're watching this film to see lots of Astaire's wonderful dancing, you'll likely be somewhat disappointed. He does do some singing and dancing, but this film mainly shows off his comic abilities, of which the mischievous Astaire has plenty. This part would have been better if the comic timing of the script had been tighter, though.

As for the second feature, ""That's Dancing"" is a documentary made in 1985 along the same lines of ""That's Entertainment"". However, in my humble opinion ""That's Entertainment"" did it before and did it better. Actually, this documentary seems a bit drawn out and lacks the excitement of its predecessor. However, you do get to see some good shots of Astaire and others doing some pretty impressive dancing. Considering the low cost of this double feature, for the ardent Astaire fan it is probably worth it.",1175558400,2,2386,4.788834951456311

7835369,4,6303039243,"Plot-wise, the film may not be its best asset. I am aware that many plots during this period of musicals were silly, but this one tops them all. Why do I give this product a 4, and not less? HD Cinema Classics have done a top-notch job restoring this film in Blu-ray and DVD. I had seen this before in one of those cheap DVD releases from public domain. The quality of image and sound are as good as those done by Criterion or Kino of films from this period. In addition to this, it provides interesting commentary about this film and its major stars by an Astaire biographer. It only has subtitles in Spanish.

What makes this Fred Astaire movie distinct from others of this decade is that he has a dancing number with Paulette Goddard, he sings once to her while declaring his love for her, he does a short ""Russian dance,"" which is not up to what he usually does, and finally, he does what I consider one of the best solos in his career: tap-dancing as an orchestra leader with Artie Shaw's band. Ironically, it is one of the best finales for his many films. This is the part I enjoy the best. Moviewise it would be a 2 out of five.",1522540800,,1135,4.25462962962963

7835373,4,6303039243,"In later life, Fred Astaire claimed that Second Chorus was the worst film he ever made. However, no film in which Astaire dances can be wholly written off and there is still much to delight his fans in this frothy caper. Fred was no mean musician and song-writer himself and he welcomed the chance to work with Artie Shaw and his band, one of the leading outfits of the day. In the film, Shaw plays a fictionalised version of himself. Fred and Buster Meredith play Danny ONeill and Hank Taylor, two college non-graduates who keep flunking their exams in order to continue earning a living with the college band. They are, by turns, good friends who connive together and rivals who do the dirty on each other, either to gain a place with Shaws band or to win the heart of Paulette Goddard, who plays Ellen Miller, Shaws manager-cum-secretary.

When Shaw agrees to audition both men for a spot as trumpet-player, Danny and Hank jeopardise each others chances, due to the fact that Danny has told Hank that Ellen has agreed to marry him. In revenge, Hank alters the music for Dannys piece, resulting in a disharmonious cacophony, while Danny pulls Hanks chair off the back of the orchestra set. Ellen is embarrassed and disheartened by their behaviour and says she doesnt want to see either one again.

Hank takes a job at the race-track while Danny finds work with an inferior band in a Russian caf. Meanwhile, Ellen has struck up a platonic friendship with Mr Chisholm, a charming bumbler and would-be mandolin-player (played by Charles Butterworth) who just happens to take her to the caf where Danny is playing. On seeing Danny, Ellen realises she still has romantic feelings for him, while he believes that her friendship with Chisholm is something more. When Ellen persuades Chisholm to provide financial backing for Shaws upcoming concert, she discusses the details with him at her home. Danny and Hank turn up there on the same evening and each brags to the other about how well they are doing in their musical careers. This leads to one of Astaires best lines from the film: Ive just hooked up with a terrific European outfit. I never dreamed such things could be done to music. Upon seeing Chisholm, Danny and Hank leap to the wrong conclusion about his and Ellens friendship and come up with a ruse to scare Chisholm off. When Ellen tells them they have alienated Shaws backer, they make amends by confessing to Chisholm that they were trying to protect Ellen and convincing him to include one of Dannys compositions in Shaws concert. We now see one of the gems of Astaires acting career in his cajoling of Meredith to come clean to Butterworth, which he does in the style of a gangster, even down to putting his hand in his pocket as though he were fingering a pistol. James Cagney once remarked that Astaire had a little of the hoodlum in him and this vignette shows how great he might have been in the kind of role normally played by Cagney himself.

There is also a delightful little exchange when Danny plays his song for Chisholm and says: Why, thats the spirit of New Orleans. I can almost smell the delta. Hank remarks: I can smell the delta! To which Chisholm replies: I have a slight cold.

Having been placated by Hank and Danny, Chisholm agrees again to back the concert, which of course is a success. Hank and Danny get places with Shaws band and Astaire (who else?) ends up with Paulette. Unlike his films with Ginger Rogers, he does get to kiss the girl in the final frame.

The dance numbers can stand up with the best of anything Astaire did in his other films and the fact that Second Chorus slumped at the box-office and is not rated more highly today is not down to him. The first dance is Dig It, to music by Hal Borne, Astaires rehearsal pianist, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Although Goddard was not in Rogers league as a dancer, she deals with the number more than adequately and, as ever, Astaire tailors his style to the capabilities of his partner while relinquishing none of his expertise. There are some sprightly sideways skips, turns and joke sequences, plus some jitterbugging, before Astaire and Goddard twirl out of the rehearsal room in a move reminiscent of his exit with Ginger Rogers in Pick Yourself Up from Swing Time.

Astaire next performs a brief prisiadka routine at the Russian caf, showing both his physical and mental flexibility (in his willingness to tackle various form of dance).

The grand finale, which lives up to its billing, is where Astaire conducts Shaws band and dances at the same time. Of course, it is difficult to do both for the entire dance, although even when not using the baton, Astaire still endeavours to conduct by using different parts of his body. The sequence involves some enchanting spins, leaps, floor-slams and truly virtuosic tapping from this sultan of sprezzatura, before Astaire finishes the number by deftly catching his trumpet and executing yet more spins with trumpet in one hand and baton in the other.

Depending which version of the DVD you buy, you may also be able to see the routine to Me and the Ghost Upstairs, as far as I know the only time that Astaire and Hermes Pan were filmed dancing together (although its difficult to recognise Pan under the ghost costume). Its such a shame that it was cut from the final film, as its pure joy, with Pan and Astaire doing some humorous mime and close partnering, a brief, discreet Lindy Hop and a conga-type finale to a Latin beat.  The frustrating thing is that the version which includes this scene has one of the worst prints of the actual film, which could have been forgiven if it didn't have so many jumps and breaks in the middle of at least one of the dance sequences.  But if you're an Astaire aficionado, as am I, you may think it's worth buying two versions of the same film to get a decent print of the feature and a reasonable print of the deleted scene.",1440720000,5,5912,4.627264061010486
