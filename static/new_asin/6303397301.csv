8210194,4,6303397301,"I just got this video this week and the question that comes to my mind is could we have a similar show today on network TV?  My answer is no.  The second portion of the video had as its lineup the Lovin Spoonful, Sonny and  Cher and the Supremes.  There is no way that you can get today's Divas on  any show like that not to mention 3 big acts on one half-hour show!  As  for the content itself, what a flashback!  The only drawback is the  kinescoped second portion of the show.  Somehow the vocals get lost a  little.  However, if you are a music historian, start out with the 12  volume Hullabaloo set.  It is well worth it.",945043200,7,627,4.116666666666666
