7920110,5,B00004CPQR,"I have an old taped version of ""Harmful Intent"", a favorite movie of my wife and myself. Unfortunately, the tape I ordered was in the PAL format and I had to return it. But the old taped version I had (which I converted to DVD), though pretty rough, was still enjoyable. An anesthetist doctor gets accused and convicted of murdering a pregnant woman by giving a higher dose of Meridrin than he thought he was giving. He gets bail and then skips and the bailbondsman sends an overzealous bounty hunter (one of the enjoyable actors in the movie!) on his trail. Running from the pistol-packing bounty hunter, contrary advice from his lawyer and the law, he gets protection from an old friend's wife. It seems the old friend was accused of the same thing, and opting not to fight, he ended his own life. Our anesthetist peruses the man's notes and realizes the details are the same in both situations. He then goes to work to uncover the perpetrator as well as the reason for both events and in the process, nearly loses his life and his new romantic interest.",1252886400,,1056,4.563157894736842
