8193791,4,6300248615,Big fan of George from his solo career in '88 but also followed him during the end of the Wham days. This cassette is a collection of 5 videos during that time period and will appeal to those who grew up in the early part of that decade like me. It is not however a documentary of the the duo's last public concert in June 1986. I have seen snippets from the show here and there but never the entire act. I had hoped this VHS would fill in the gaps. That being said enjoy Michael and Ridgely in their exuberant youth and vitality and for their infectious pop sense. It will bring back a flood of memories!,1402185600,,605,4.135593220338983
