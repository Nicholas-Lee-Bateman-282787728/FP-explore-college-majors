The plot in a nutshell-a tax collector screws up during a collection run, and with nowhere to stay, decides he'll take his chances and stay in the deserted monastery on the outskirts of town. He meets a beautiful woman and a mad Taoist swordsman. When he discovers the woman is a ghost trapped by the Tree Demon he enlists the help of the Taoist in order to save her.
There are great performances from Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma-they both seemed to be born to play their roles.

Together with the help of the Taoist swordsman Yen, Ning must gather the courage to defeat the ancient demon in order to free his love forever! A CHINESE GHOST STORY is one of the finest pieces of Hong Kong horror cinema, and Tsui Hark's crowning achievement within the genre. At its heart is a beautiful tragedy between two torn lovers, but on the surface, A CHINESE GHOST STORY is an action-packed horror comedy that takes influence from both East and West, including Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD, Obayashi's HOUSE, and Hong Kong's own MR. VAMPIRE series. The shadowy temples and shrouded forests already set an eerie mood, but it is the superior cinematography that brings them to life as we follow the wolves and spirits that haunt the woods. Built upon these stunning locations are a number of incredible special effects, combining the high-flying acrobatics of the Chinese sword fighting film with flowing robes, mystical powers, and an enormous demon with a wicked tongue. For all of its style and visual grace, A CHINESE GHOST STORY is met with equally impressive performance by the entire cast. Leslie Cheung is playfully naive as Ning, who becomes easily enchanted by the beautiful Joey Wong as the ghost of Hsiao Tsing. A CHINESE GHOST STORY blends all of the most terrifying, exciting, and atmospheric elements of Hong Kong fantasy film making to produce one of the greatest unknown classics of the horror genre.

Romantic and creepy, action-packed and humorous, deeply haunting and cheerfully light-hearted, it somehow manages to blend these diverse genres and moods into a wonderfully convincing mix. Some of the scenes are just breathtakingly beautiful, too. And I don't want to go reading too much into what is clearly meant to be (and suceeds in being) good simple entertainment, but anyone interested in how Taoism and Buddhism (significantly, they aren't very distinct here) actually operate in the popular imagination could spend days analyzing this enjoyable film.

It must be admitted that (as others have noted here) the subtitles are about the worst I've ever seen. While the dialogue doesn't necessarily have a lot of nuance, and while the story moves along primarily through visual means (one could probably pretty much follow the story with no subtitles at all), still, some proofreading and perhaps some consultation with someone whose first language is English might have been a good idea.

961884,5,6305020876,"I originally saw this movie when it first hit the USA market.  No subtitles!  All the Malaysian male students that I worked with were in love with the female lead in this movie.  They kept talking about how graceful her hands were, they had never seen a woman so beautiful, so graceful who held herself so beautifully.  I know one student watched it over 20 times.  None of them spoke or read Chinese!

I, an American female, was so intrigued by their interest, I went and rented this movie.  I had such FUN!  watching the movie, and trying to figure out what was going on, I rented it over 10 times!  Needless to say, the female lead is incredibly graceful, I was touched by the innocence of the male lead part.  The male students were all invigorated by his innocence and good soul!  and yet he could attract the attention of such a beautiful ghost.

This movie NOW!  has come out with ENGLISH subtitles!  Half the fun of watching this movie is laughing over the subtitles.  I wish the other reviewers had a SENSE of HUMOR!  Get a life people!  This is a FUNNY movie!  it is low budget, without the billions of dollars on special effects.  It is touching because the characters are!  The story is funny, warm, scary and loving because of the acting!  characters!  and the good direction!

I find it sad that it is difficult now, to find movies with this type of fun, funny, supernatural good story telling style.

961885,4,6305020876,"A Chinese Ghost Story (Siu-Tung Ching, 1987)

A Chinese Ghost Story is the kind of movie that makes you wonder what it is the Hong Kong film guys are doing right that we're not. There's so much in here that Americans have repeatedly tried to do, and failed far more often than not. Here, it all works.

Ning Tsai-Shen (the late Leslie Cheung, fresh off his success in A Better Tomorrow) is a neophyte tax collector who's had a run of very bad luck. He asks where he can spend the night for no money, and is told about a haunted temple outside of town. After settling down, he's drawn to the sound of a lute, which is played by Nieh Hsiao-Tsing (Joey Wong, who also acted opposite Cheung in the recent Ashes Time). Of course, he falls in love with the girl, despite the warnings of Yen (Ma Wu of Iron Monkey II), a local hermit who's familiar with the haunted temple and the evils that reside there.

It sounds like a horror film, but it's not. In fact, it's a rather sweet, good-natured romantic comedy. (With zombies. See, Shaun of the Dead isn't the only one.) Tsai-Shen is a great bumbling hero, and the opening scene of him suffering misfortunes along the road into town is wonderfully done. Hundreds of American filmmakers could take a lesson from the combination of understatement and slapstick used in the opening sequence. (His oblivious search for his inkpad later in the film is another scene that stands way, way out from the crowd.) The everpresent martial arts sequences have a Three Stooges feel to them, but work better than Three Stooges routines ever did. With all this going on, most filmmakers on this side of the Pacific, assuming they could pull all that off, would let the effects become the movie and ignore the story. Not here, though to be fair the movie is a tad thin on plot. But then, it's a romantic comedy. How much plot do you need? Boy meets ghost, boy gets ghost, boy loses ghost, boy has to save ghost from eternal damnation. A tale as old as time.

One can't blame Siu-Tung Ching for this, but whoever does the subtitles at DirectMedia, Chinese Ghost Story's American distributor, really needs to go back to school. The subtitles in this movie are worse than anything I've ever seen from Tai Seng-- and that's saying something. Even though it's not the film's fault, I took off half a star simply because at times I had no earthly idea what was going on. (At other times, I didn't care, because the Engrish was so hysterical.)

Anyway, though, recommended. I strongly suggest seeing it with someone who speaks Cantonese so you can get an accurate translation of some scenes, though. *** ",1095984000,13,2622,4.568085106382979

The effects are natural and unique in this film. There is a transexual tree monster who rules the beautiful dead ghost, who has to be a vampire in order to survive in the ghost world. They are all living in a temple with a possible ghost or warrior, wasn't quite clear. The warrior stood for good and fought the evil. When a young man who is naive and doesn't realize the temple is haunted stumbles in and falls in love with the bewitched beautiful vampire ghost. He does not know she is dead yet and they have a lovely romance sequence. Soon he finds out she is a ghost and wants to help her escape her karma and be reborn again. With the sanskrit words and the help of the good warrior, they take on the tree monster and even go to hell to fight for the spirit of the beautiful ghost finally making there way back to the world. A shimmering image filled feat! Just like the haunted mansion you always wanted to see. Highly Highly Recommended. It has subtitles and they are sometimes hard to follow. This is a movie definately for art lovers and whoever else that is open to something new and different.

961887,4,6305020876,"I saw Chinese Ghosty Story II before Chinese Ghost Story, and there's a marked difference between the two. Unfortunately, there are several important plot points from the two movies that join them in a way that makes both better (including a song that takes on a whole new meaning when you realize it's sung by two different characters in each movie).
Chinese Ghost Story is not as wacky or enthralling as its sequel, with less special effects and a more uneven rhythm. The plot, in short, is about Ning Tsei-Shen, a tax collector, falling in love with a ghost, Nieh Hsiao-Tsing, who is kept by a, uh, ""tree hag."" The tree hag uses her to kill unwitting male mortals.
One particularly weird point is that the tree hag can transform into a gigantic tongue, which shoves itself down men's throats in Alien-esque fashion. Upon doing so, the victim's life force is sucked out. So in essence, the tree hag gives one serious French kiss.
I've since read elsewhere that Sam Raimi took inspiration from this film for Evil Dead, a connection I made on my own. The animated trees, the grasping tentacles, the perspective from the demon's point of view, and even the tree hag's shout that she'll ""swallow your chi!"" - yep, Sam saw this movie and loved it.
Ghost life is different than typical European ghost folklore. In Chinese Ghost Story, ghosts are more like faeries. They have lives, get married, argue, have relatives, etc. In this case, Nieh Hsiao-Tsing is torn by her role of luring men to their doom and her affection for the hapless tax collector. Worse, she is promised to some unspeakable evil guy in hell.
Our fearless protagonist stumbles into this plot because his tax records are rained on, thus leaving him without any means of getting paid for his hard work. Broke and desperate, Ning Tsei-Shen can only afford to stay in a haunted temple to stay out of the rain.
Chinese Ghost Story is like an Asian version of Romeo and Juliet, down to the help friar -- in this case, a crazy monk who happens to enjoy the presence of spirits more than living people. Although we don't get much perspective on Ning Tsei-Shen's life prior to the story, Nieh Hsiao-Tsing's back-story is fleshed out. She has sisters, all of whom were murdered and left without a proper burial ritual.
As ghosts, they serve a weird tree demon who is actually a man dressed in drag. This is an ongoing theme throughout both movies - demons always look like men, but dress and sound like women. It's strangely effective in making the demons seem immediately wrong, even in their supposedly mortal forms.
The struggle here is not to reunite the two lovers - that's understood to be an impossible task. Instead, it's a race to put Nieh Hsiao-Tsing to rest before she is married to the Unspeakable Evil. A final burial means the ghost also has a chance at being reincarnated as opposed to roaming the Earth or being married in hell. In comparison to the other two fates, reincarnation sounds a lot better.
Of course, things don't go that smoothly. Nieh Hsiao-Tsing is kidnapped, and the dynamic duo of bumbling tax collector and crotchety monk pursue her right into hell. The action propels itself along so quickly that things become confusing - I picked up a lot on second viewing because the characters shout or react so quickly to Hell, which is a murky place.
Between the three protagonists, they manage to defeat Hell's minions, an axe-wielding general, and the big bad himself.
Ning Tsei-Shen looks over his shoulder and his ghostly love is gone. Next we see him giving her a proper burial. Then Ning Tsei-Shen points - we can only assume at a rainbow in the distance that we see in the next scene - and the tax collector and the monk ride off into the distance.
POOF! The end.
To say the ending is jarring is an understatement. The director's style definitely matured in the second movie. This first movie is an excellent set up for the sequel, but on its own it seems like a pastiche of ideas and concepts that were never fully executed. A must-see if you want to fully enjoy Chinese Ghost Story II.",1079913600,6,4074,4.64404432132964

During the night Tsai-Shen meets Hsiao-Tsing with whom he falls in love with, but he is unaware that she is a ghost.  Chinese Ghost Story is a touching love story full of swashbuckling adventure and humor as Tsai-Shen ignorantly tumbles through an adventure with horrors around every corner.  However, the comedy is not as well balanced with the horror, since the comedy removes the suspense as it often is slap-stick humor.

961947,5,6305020876,"""A Chinese Ghost Story"", one of my favourite Chinese fantasy movies, is based on a short story, ""Nie Xiaoqian"", from a 17th century compilation of Chinese ghost stories called ""Strange Tales from Liaozhai"".  Joey Wong, one of the great beauties of Hong Kong cinema, is Nie Xiaoqian, a ghost who lures men to their deaths against her will.  Xiaoqian died young and her ashes were buried under an old tree by her father.  Unbeknownst to him, the tree, having lived for a thousand years, has been transformed into a bisexual demon who feeds on the ""qi"" (Chinese term which translates roughly as ""breath"" or ""life energy"") of men.  Holding Xiaoqian's ashes hostage so she could not be reincarnated, the demon forces Xiaoqian to capture young men for him/her.  (Note: the ancient Chinese believed in the Buddhist concept of the Wheel of Existence, where death is but a transition to the next level of existence, be it as a ghost, a demon, a god, or another human being.)  Leslie Cheung is Ning Chaichen, a poor scholar who spends a night at an abandoned temple near where Xiaoqian's ashes were buried.  Xiaoqian meets Chaichen, and realising that he is kind and good-hearted, spares him from the demon's clutches.  They soon fall in love, but with a conniving sister, a wicked foster mother/father and being very dead, can Xiaoqian find true happiness?  ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" was a big hit when it was released in the late 80s.  It spawned two sequels and numerous copycats.  Joey Wong gained immediate fame in Asia (Leslie Cheung was already famous) but was often typecast (typecasted?) in similar roles thereafter for years.  Likewise Wu Ma, who plays the sage who comes to Xiaoqian and Chaichen's rescue.  Joey Wong's ethereal beauty made her especially suitable for roles as the damsel (dead or alive) in distress.  Leslie Cheung is excellent in his role as the archetypal poor Chinese scholar who has to lodge in abandoned temples because he could not afford the inn.  The movie is full of grand Chinese imagery - the creepy abandoned buildings, the beautiful silk costumes, the intricate hairpieces (the demon's hairpiece is a wonder to behold, and much imitated in Chinese movies thereafter), sages, warriors, scholars, ghosts and, of course, the Diamond Sutra.  To enjoy the movie fully, be prepared to suspend disbelief and accept the wondrous - people who have read ancient Chinese classics like ""Strange Tales from Liaozhai"", ""Journey to the West"" or ""Creation of the Gods"" will know that the Chinese (ancient or modern) have always had a worldview that includes the unseen, the wondrous, and the impossible.  A further note of interest for Xena fans - the series finale of Xena: Warrior Princess borrowed heavily from the opening scenes of ""A Chinese Ghost Story"", right down to the bells worn around the ankles that summoned the evil Yodoshi.  If you loved that final episode of Xena, grab a copy of this movie and watch its inspiration.",1058313600,5,2947,4.907258064516129

There he meets a Taoist monk/master swordsman/ghost buster who is the only other human staying at the temple. He also meets a very beautiful young woman, Nieh Hsiao-Tsing, whom he falls in love with.

My Opinion:  At first I had a hard time with the poor English subtitles and strange story. But then I was pulled into the love story and began to understand what was going on. Some of the small things that happen in the beginning are a bit confusing but I think this is mostly due to the cultural differences and poor subtitles. I ended up liking the movie very much. It has horror, action, and romance all very well mixed up into an entertaining package. The special effects are quite good. The plot is very filled out as well. The Taoist monk is a very cool character and you can't help but fall in love with the maiden ghost Nieh Hsiao-Tsing.
DVD Quality:  Non anamorphic, no English language sound track, poor English subtitles
What You Should Do:  Rent it. Don't buy this edition, wait for a new version that has an anamorphic transfer. This movie is what I would consider a fairly hard core Hong Kong film. You need to be into this type of film to enjoy it. If you are into this genre you should definitely see it and also check out The Bride With The White Hair.",991699200,40,1595,4.4673539518900345

7882412,3,6305020876,"This is a fun Chinese Comedy/Romance, it's really not much of a horror movie even with the ghosts and demons in it. A tax collector is forced to stay in a haunted temple and gets into one situation after another, and then meets an attractive ghost and falls in love with her. There is a lot of the usual Chinese slapstick and some martial arts. But the main story is the romance between the ghost and the tax collector. Featuring the talents of Leslie Cheung and the attractive Joey Wang, it's hard to go wrong with this movie.",1455148800,,527,4.387755102040816

7882416,5,6305020876,"This movie has EVERYTHING going for it.
it's very old, the plot is simple but perfect

A simple everyday guy meets a beautiful girl, he learns she is a spirit destined to marry a demon lord and he go's to rescue her,
he finds a super powerful monk warrior and together they embark on a journey to kill demons and rescue the girl.

The Music, the Acting, the fight choreography are all perfect,
The movie is a blend of Horror, Drama and a Romantic comedy, it has everything from monsters and very sweet and romantic moments, to scary demons. and it has a lot of of funny moments as well.

All characters are just COOL, the Warriors, good and bed, the main hero, the tree demon, all great

This film takes me back to when movies were simple and beautiful and fun to watch, just pure joy.",1379980800,,785,4.319727891156463

Excellent example of the ghost story romance genre of HK movies.  The subtitles are fairly crummy, but not so much that you will be distracted from the story line.  Visually stunning -- worth it just to *look at*.  A must-see.",1376611200,5,363,4.454545454545454
