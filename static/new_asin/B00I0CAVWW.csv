6245876,5,B00I0CAVWW,"This movie will shock you! I was very surprise with the story line, it was like having 3 movies in one. Just when you think you know what's going on, another turn sends your brain into chaos. I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies but this one just took me by surprise. The plot, the character development, and the idea of living inside your head makes this movie a 5 star for a movie with virtually no budget. If you're into movies that keep you guessing up till the end, then this movie is the right one for you. You like indie movies, then please do yourself a favor and get this movie! You won't be disappointed.",1394755200,,621,4.183333333333334
6245877,5,B00I0CAVWW,"Emulation involves a college students movie simulation experience. The student, played by Tom Getty, agrees to play the part, but when he goes along with it, he finds himself set up for murder! The whole story line is so creative because a lot of the ideas in the film are about our culture and how we perceive real life. Low budget, an incredibly talented young producer, unprofessional actors and suspense in every scene- this movie will have you ""on the edge of your seat.""
""Emulation is mind-blowing film with a cool twist at the end. Buy it!!!",1394755200,3,548,4.65979381443299
6245878,5,B00I0CAVWW,"YOU'RE BEING WATCHED !!!
Sometimes you really get a feeling these days that you're being watched. ""EMULATION,"" really gives that feeling, and then turns it on your head. The Emulation corporation gives you the experience of ""living"" through your favorite movie. Really cool idea made into a neat indie-type movie. Reminded me of Christopher Nolan's ""Following,"" in how the plot messes with your perception and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. Brilliantly acted, superbly written infectiously entertaining!!! I can't wait to see what's next  from Tom Getty !",1393545600,2,570,5.333333333333333
6245879,4,B00I0CAVWW,"Great directing. Fast paced. Keeps your attention. Has a feel like the second Bourne movie but without the shaky cam. No lulls in the plot, so go to the bathroom before it starts.",1391731200,,179,4.454545454545454
6245910,5,B00I0CAVWW,"This movie was filled with action, suspense, and twists and turns until the very end. I read this movie had a budget of $500.00, which is incredible considering movies cost millions to make. It's like something you'd see in a Big Blockbuster movie, but has an independent vibe to it and was well edited. We watched it with our family and ended up watching it twice on the same day to really see the ""clues!""
This is a must-see movie, one you won't forget. It appeals to all ages and keeps your mind wandering and thinking where the plot is going. It stands right up with many action packed movies that have won awards and are popular today!

6245911,5,B00I0CAVWW,"This film was entertaining, thought provoking and surprising from the start! You immediately get to see, and relate to the lonely and bored with life main character, Noah. The film takes him through what was supposed to be an entertaining night using a new concept, to a fight for his life! For an independent film, the action shots are breath taking. I was on the edge of my seat until the very last scene wondering how it was going to end for this somewhat naive and sheltered character who was thrust in circumstances and craziness beyond his control. Noah learns the hard way that life and the movies, aren't always what they claim to be.",1395619200,,642,4.591304347826087
6245912,4,B00I0CAVWW,"10/10 would watch again. Buy it, watch it, then watch it again. Sit down, relax, and party with this movie. Do it!",1395619200,3,114,4.2272727272727275
6245913,5,B00I0CAVWW,"A clever plot accentuated with irrefutable director creativity, this film leaves the audience's mind absolutely blown. If it ever reaches theaters, no need to purchase a whole seat. You'll only need half of one as you'll be on the edge of it throughout the entire movie!",1395619200,2,270,4.891304347826087
6245914,5,B00I0CAVWW,"An amazing director, actor, and movie.  All of your hard work paid off! I look forward to seeing what you accomplish in the future:)",1395532800,,132,4.5
6245915,5,B00I0CAVWW,"Is your life real, is it staged? A fine job of making you paranoid, unsure of your surroundings.
Suspense and Action packed movie filmed in Pittsburgh PA.
Director Tom Getty, who also stars in his movie is a great storyteller.",1395446400,3,226,4.675
6245916,5,B00I0CAVWW,"Great 5-star movie, thoroughly enjoyed watching this! The idea and story are a great idea for a movie, and I was glad to see this film put together. Will watch again!",1395273600,3,166,4.387096774193548
6245917,5,B00I0CAVWW,"This movie is an amazing achievement. I read that the whole thing was shot with no budget, but that seems impossible, given the kind of action we see here. Budget or not, how did this young director get at least a HUNDRED police cars to converge at the site of the action? How many donuts would that have taken? Who else could do that--Scorsese, maybe? I'm not so sure. It's clear that Tom Getty is going places, both as a director and an actor. A lot of local color and slightly creepy characters. The guy playing the professor at the end cracked me up. I think I had him in college--perfect!",1395273600,6,593,4.351351351351352
6245918,5,B00I0CAVWW,"Simulating real life becomes reality, and a frightening one at that as Emulation sees Noah running for his life, and for his innocence.....while you stay on the edge of your seat.
Full of action and ever-changing situations, don't miss Emulation!",1395273600,2,246,5.175
6245919,5,B00I0CAVWW,"Getty makes the most of his budget with clever storytelling and interesting camera work. This is a fun action movie with some elements of ""1984"" meets ""Total Recall"" meets awesome fugitive film. Definitely re-watchable as you go back and try to pick out clues.  Also a bonus- appropriate for most kids (no sex or gore, just action!).",1395273600,,333,4.842105263157895

8637962,5,B00I0CAVWW,Strangest movie that I have seen and still liked. I thought at first that it was just another amateurish crap movie but I hung in long enough that the plot grabbed me. I am glad I stayed to watch it. What a brain twister.,1523318400,,221,4.045454545454546
8637963,2,B00I0CAVWW,The 5 star reviews are lies most likely written by friends of the kids in the film. Hard to take this film seriously in any way when all the actors are baby faced 20-25ish. Can't get in to believing FBI agents that look like they could high school seniors or my kids' friends. Gave up on it at the point where the main character has to escape the police building says where am i going to go and walks right past the giant freaking EXIT sign to instead try every other door down the hall and decide to pull the fire alarm instead without even checking the obvious exit.,1501891200,4,568,4.220183486238532

8637967,1,B00I0CAVWW,"Ridiculous story, bad acting, bad effects and all this movie leaves you with is a ""what the....."" thought. Spare yourself the pain.",1409184000,4,131,5.0
8637968,2,B00I0CAVWW,"In the interests of providing full information to others, I have to point out that this is basically a student film. I don't know if it was actually a student project, but it looks to be one. It's strange that most of the other reviewers, as of my posting, don't mention this. There haven't been very many reviewers so far, and perhaps they have a personal interest or connection with the film. I don't know, and I will let other viewers who see the film judge for themselves.

Judged properly as a student film, Emulation is pretty impressive. There are some interesting ideas here, and there is real artistry in some of the shots and camera work, especially on such a limited budget.

On the one hand I hate to give this film only two stars, but on the other hand I would be doing a disservice to others if I gave it more without pointing out that this is a student film and needs to be judged as such, especially since other reviewers have not so far made this clear.

So if you want to see a good student film, prepare to be impressed. But if you are expecting a movie that you might see in theaters, prepare to be disappointed. You have been warned.",1404000000,4,1154,4.333333333333333
8637969,1,B00I0CAVWW,"This one looks like a college film project.  The reviews got me hooked into this one regrettably.  This one is so low budget, amateur attempt without the funding to do the script any justice.  Actors were too young. Another what if life is a hallucination film. Unwatchable.",1397779200,6,274,4.787234042553192
