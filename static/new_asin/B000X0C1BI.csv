It starts with Yvan posing on a white backdrop (shirtless) in some jeans, then takes them off and shows his underwear, then poses around some plants and then gets naked, then poses on a small bed in black underwear. Then poses on a wooden wall in a open white dress shirt/dress pants. Then poses in nothing but a white button shirt. Then poses in blue jeans, then shows his underwear. Then poses in a speedo with a female model in a two-piece swimsuit. Then poses around some trees in long red underwear (with worker boots). Then he poses by a bathtub in white underwear, then poses in the bathtub with water/bubble bath. Then poses in 3 different underwear. Then naked on a wooden deck and a deck chair, and the video ends with him posing in blue jeans.

There's also a special feature on the video, a Slideshow with 99 pictures of Yvan Cournoyer from this video.

Some of the footage is from another video by Yvan Cournoyer called ""In My Element.""

This video is OK. Just another behind the scenes photoshoot, nothing else.",1288137600,5,1110,4.535
