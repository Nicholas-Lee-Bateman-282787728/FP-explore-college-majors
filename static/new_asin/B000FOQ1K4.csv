You expected technicolor pristine footage of Fats Waller ?  What makes this dvd unwatchable is that the screen shrinks down to a quarter of the size every 30 seconds or so , so you can read some crap that they have randomly put on the screen behind some odd animation . How's that for archival presentation ? Totally lame . Buy this footage elsewhere.",1440028800,,504,4.361702127659575
