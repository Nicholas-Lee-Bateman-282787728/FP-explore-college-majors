8295910,5,B001E181YG,This was a gift and is enjoyed by our whole family,1417651200,3,50,3.6363636363636362
8295911,2,B001E181YG,"The performances are not bad on this DVD, however it does dissapoint if you're seeking really traditional Irish music. Most of this sounds like 60s
Folk Rock. Where are some good Irish Tenors when you need them? All you have here is Rock musicians trying their best to strain out semi Irish tunes with a Rock beat.  Not horrible, but definitely not ""Gaelic"" spirit.",1332720000,2,365,4.703125
8295912,3,B001E181YG,"This concert is just O.K. for me. It is enjoyable but I already have a couple of songs on ""Greatest Irish Artists Gaelforce"". I prefer ""Absolutely Irish"" or my favorite ""Ragus"". dBahr",1255824000,4,183,4.75
8295913,5,B001E181YG,"Irish folk musician and producer assembles an eclectic but well suited group of musicians on this DVD, with major stars Morrison, Costello and Knopfler and more as well as less well known, but exceedingly talented, performers.

Two of the songs - Raglan Road and She Moved Through the Fair - were on the extraordinary Van Morrison and the Chieftains cd, which sets a very high bar for Mark Knopfler and Sinead O'Connor. O'Connor does a nice job; Knopfler's rendering is worthy though he fails to capture the anguish expressed in Van's wrenching version. There are fabulous Dance Tunes,  a marvelous St. Dominic's Preview, and several beautiful love songs. A very satisfying, varied, yet homogeneous, collection of performances, every one of them well worth repeated listens.",1226016000,6,774,5.184
