8608586,4,B009ZI5DGY,"I originally bought the DVD because I thought it had the full 45 minute reunion jam of the frantic four. It didn't, so I ended up downloading the four part get-together from You Tube. Instead of the full gig, we were only given highlights. It would have been nice to have a bonus disc with the full performance - Warts and all.

I had been a solid Quo fan from Piledriver in 1972 until the Original band finished around 1982. There was only a brief mention about the original keyboards guy (I think his name was Jess Jaworski - Something like that) - It would have been great to have had an interview from him (If he is still alive) - Things like this, die-hard Quo fans need to know, because they know everything else. The thing which really annoyed me was that there was absolutely no mention (Verbally or written) of early Keyboards player Roy Lynes. He obviously featured on the early Beat Club performances (Pictures of Matchstick Men etc) and was even still part of the early Boogie period of Quo (As can be seen on their BBC performance of 'Doin their thing' in 1970). I knew personally that Roy left for New Zealand (I am a Kiwi myself) but I never knew why he left, if he was sacked etc and I don't have a clue what he did since he left. I am actually going to google his name after this review and find out for myself out of interest. Pete Kircher, who replaced John Coghlan also gets no mention (All we see of him is his meeting of Prince Charles at the Princes Trust concert in 1982). Why was there no interview with him, and again, what happened to him after this line-up of Quo last played together at Live Aid. Virtually every member of Quo gets interviewed (The frantic four plus Rhino Edwards, Jeff Rich, Andy Bown Bob Young and Matt Letley. The only two missing are Lynnes and Kircher. I find that was such a shame. It would have been nice to have credits at the end to explain the reasons that they weren't interviewed. On Judas Priest's celebration of British Steel, there is absolutely no mention or credit  of the drummer at that time (i.e. Dave Holland), most probably because he was convicted and jailed for child sex offences after he left the band. There are plenty of interviews with fans and colleagues too including Paul Weller, Chris Tarrant, Joe Elliott etc. As much as I find Joe Elliott outspoken, I found his utterances to be spot on. However, I thought that Jeff Lynne came across as overdoing the praise, especially when Quo's music was on the wane. The DVD is filled with excerpts of Quo tracks from all periods of their career with no rare performances which is a shame, because I only found out TONIGHT by watching on You Tube that Quo performed 'Is it really me' from Beat Club in 1970. I watched every Beat Club show possible, and I was only aware that Quo played ' Spinning Wheel Blues' and 'April Spring Summers and Wednesdays'. I am just wondering if there are more unearthed Beat Club performances of the Quo from this period. Look what happened to all the performances of Rory Gallagher that were unearthed only around the time of the 'Ghost Blues' DVD. The Lost Broadcasts with Yes, Iron Butterfly etc are others. Is there a Lost Broadcast of Quo? As I say, it would have been nice to have seen more rare performances of Quo on this DVD. I remember seeing Status Quo in New Zealand in 1976. As part of the hype, they had a TV show called 'Gizago' hosted by an English guy called STu Dennison. On that show, they played the promo for Mystery Song, and they also played 'Don't waste my time' and 'Paper Plane' from the Marquee from 1972. These tracks can also be seen on You Tube. However, they also screened 'Roadhouse Blues' from the Marquee. I have never seen this track since, and I don't know of anyone who has also seen this. I have also been told by a guy in Ireland that he saw a TV clip of Quo doing Bye Bye Johnny  from the same Marquee show. Where are these clips? Does Mr Rossi or Mr Parfitt know that these clips exist? Overall, this DVD is compelling viewing. It was overly long, but unusually for me in this day and age, I watched it in its entirety without touching the remote. I lost interest in Quo after 'In the Army Now' but it was the reunion of Coghlan and Lancaster that tempted me to buy the DVD. It would have been nice to have seen the original line-up live in the flesh again but this DVD is a good substitute. What next? The logical thing is for an official release of one of the reunion shows. I will be first in line to buy that one

FOOTNOTE - I googled Roy Lynes and found out that he joined the band in 1964 and left the band in 1970  after he fell in love. He was supposed to be the quiet one. The strange thing is that Roy met up with the band when they toured New Zealand (That would have been in 1976 when I saw them, although they did play a festival with Black Sabbath a couple of years earlier) Wiki also reports that Lynes played onstage with Quo in Australia in 2000, and that he also played in Quo tribute band State Oz Quo. Rossi mentions in Wiki that Lynnes looked really happy. Why couldn't any of this be mentioned. If I was Roy Lynes, I would be really pissed off. He was in the band for 6 years and got absolutely no mention at all. I have since found out from another reviewer of this DVD that Pete Kircher had in fact refused to be interviewed. Probably due to him wanting to keep a dignified silence and avoid the sudden interest in re-recognition.",1366675200,,5445,4.329089128305583
8608587,3,B009ZI5DGY,"The movie is good, but could have been better. The bonus disc is for completists only, and I am a Quo fanatic! Three extra hours of fairly ordinary footage, and no mention of Roy Lynes, the original keyboard player, or any attempt to interview him. Some earlier obscure clips (Price Of Love, Make me Stay A Bit Longer) would have been good.",1360886400,,340,4.5
8608588,5,B009ZI5DGY,Every kid in Britain has some part of Status Quo embedded in their DNA. I absolutely loved many of their songs and this DVD does a great job of capturing their history as well as their music.,1360368000,,191,4.1891891891891895
