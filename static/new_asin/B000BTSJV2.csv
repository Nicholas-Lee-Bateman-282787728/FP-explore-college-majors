2441302,3,B000BTSJV2,I didn't read the title carefully...I am holding on to this DVD until I lose the weight I need.,1170288000,2,95,4.052631578947368
2441303,5,B000BTSJV2,"This pilates workout is the best pilates video I've come across so far. I've been doing Winsor Pilates for a couple years now, and Caban's Maintenance Pilates is a welcome contrast. Caban is very calm and soothing (unlike Winsor's peppy and rushed style). The motions are slow and deliberate, yet Caban goes through each exercise quite swiftly and fast enough for the non-beginner. This has become my regular pilates video, and Winsor Pilates does not compare to this in rigor or style. This video has marked the beginning of an improvement in my quality of life. I have increased mobility and flexibility, and my back and hip stiffness significantly decreases after I complete the workout everyday. What is different about this video is that when I'm doing the exercises, I'm not thinking, ""I can't wait for this to end."" I enjoy the full stretch of the each exercise, and I don't even get bored or unattentive during the +25 minutes of the video.

I don't think this particular workout would be suitable for beginners. Caban's explanations are great, but they are not thorough enough for the first-timer. The exercises can be difficult at times.",1168041600,86,1147,4.912371134020619
2441304,4,B000BTSJV2,I've tried several different Pilates dvds and this is my favourite one by far! Ana adds some challenging exercises and a little bit of cardio towards the end. I wouldn't use this is as my only means of exercise but it has helped me with my back and shoulder problems (typical stress spots).,1161648000,3,290,4.490566037735849
2441305,5,B000BTSJV2,"I have several pilates videos which I use regularly, and since I own one of Ana Caban's earlier videos, I decided to get it. The routine is fast-paced - not for beginners - and it's filled with new twists! Some of the exercises are challenging, but I am confident I will eventually master them.  The 15-minute bonus workout is good for when I don't have much time. I like Ana, she is a no-nonsense instructor and takes great care in producing quality workouts.",1152057600,12,460,4.542168674698795
2441306,5,B000BTSJV2,"Wow! Ana sure knows how to pack a wallop in just under 30 minutes!! Maintenance Pilates definitely takes the Pilates exercises to a whole new level! Some new moves I never seen before have been included in this workout, such as the crab (it'll take a while for me to master this move). Anyway,everything is included in this workout,leg work, arm work, including cardio (jumping jacks). In addition, Ana has also included a 15-minute bonus workout. This one has a fun move, like the rolling like a ball around the clock. I can't wait to practice this move. Ana, you are SO good!!

Another feature I noticed is that there is a langauge option in doing this work-either regular English or Spanish. I think that's an awesome thing to.",1138838400,35,730,4.658914728682171
2441307,3,B000BTSJV2,"This workout is not as good as I had hoped. The transitions are not smooth, and I feel I have spent a lot of time getting up or down, and getting into the pose. I have an old DVD ""Body target ABS"" from GAIAM, featuring Ana Caban and Rodney Yee. The 30 pilates workout by Ana in that DVD are about 70% same as this one, and I feel that one is much better done. It is much intenser, and integrated. I doubt this Maintenance DVD could be a good one for maintaining the weight loss. My heart rate did not increase at all, and whatever heat that might have been produced, quickly get lost during the transition. On the other, this workout has a few new poses that are interesting, and might be good to incorporate to other workouts.",1435622400,,727,4.2

2441313,4,B000BTSJV2,"This video has nearly the SAME exercises as Winsor Pilates Accelerated Body Sculpting by Mari Winsor.  So I wouldn't recommend this DVD if you already have Mari's.  mari's has slightly better explanations of proper form, but she has titles between each video, showing the name of the upcoming exercise.  That makes Mari's video last 55-60"", instead of this one, which runs 45"".  (I fast forward through the titles.)
I feel I wasted money on this.",1407628800,,446,4.906666666666666

2441316,3,B000BTSJV2,This DVD was okay.  I didn't really feel that my heart rate was elevated enough for weight loss.  It was easy to follow along and some of the ab exercises were extremely challenging.  I would have liked more variety.,1400457600,,216,4.487179487179487

2441318,4,B000BTSJV2,"It gets a little boring doing the same one every time.  Yes, i am getting stronger because i can do some of the moves easier now than when i first started, but need some variety!  I like Ana Caban, the instructor, she's calm and she explains the positions well.  maybe i'll buy another one of her dvd's.  they should make a compilation of Ana Caban pilates workouts on one dvd.",1382313600,,377,4.3428571428571425
2441319,4,B000BTSJV2,"This is a good workout to take it from a beginner level to intermediate. It's challenging and interesting without being nuts. It's not for beginners, and I don't really think it's modifiable for beginners either. Both the 30 and the 15 minute workouts are intense, complete workouts. But 30 minutes with a separate 15 minute bonus workout is NOT a 45 minute workout. I was hoping this was more like my slower, longer, more relaxing pilates DVDs when I ordered, but it's very different. I'm glad I got this, though, it'll be good for me to mix it up and try to take it to the next level. Feel like I should warn everyone to be careful with this one! I was afraid I was going to bust a gut! (Her peppy mannerisms and buzzwords are not my thing. That's the type of teacher I usually avoid, but it didn't end up bothering me so much.)",1379289600,2,830,4.326923076923077
2441320,4,B000BTSJV2,I like the pace of the video and it's fairly easy to follow. A few of the moves are difficult but with time I will be able to do them with no problem I'm sure.,1375142400,,159,3.5714285714285716
2441321,3,B000BTSJV2,"But I didn't like the dvd's layout. Long intro, didn't feel the workout was ordered or segmented as well as it could have been...and the instructor's voice really annoyed me...but great moves that will keep you fit.",1372377600,,215,4.837837837837838
2441322,4,B000BTSJV2,This video is a good workout for anyone with a basic familiarity with pilates.  The moves are challenging but realistic.  The pace is good with some verbal guidance from the instructor.,1372291200,,185,4.935483870967742

2441324,4,B000BTSJV2,"One note, it says its a 45 minute workout - its actually a 30 minute workout, then you get a 15 minute bonus section.
There is a break in continuity if you go from one section to another, and a sense that you've done enough as she wraps it all up after the 30 minutes. But its a good workout, a good pace as well.",1365465600,2,313,3.830769230769231
2441325,4,B000BTSJV2,"This is my second pilates DVD I have bought to do at home. I would consider myself at a beginner to intermediate level. She goes through the series at a good speed, it is not too fast for me. I like the bonus workout at the end. Together I get a great workout. I wish there were more of the leg exercises.",1359676800,2,305,3.935483870967742
2441326,4,B000BTSJV2,"This's a very good work-out DVD and a longer version of Ana's Pilates Abs Workout. Because it's longer, it offers a more complete body work-out instead of solely focusing on the abs like the other one (which is why the other one is deemed Abs Workout). The narration is also clear and helpful.

Although some movements are suitable for everyone, some are more challenging and seem to be for people who've had experience with pilates though they aren't necessarily of advanced level. Also, Ana seems to go through the movements rather quickly, and she sometimes sounds a little annoying in this DVD while trying to make the work-out session more relaxing (believe me, you'll need a complete focus to do pilates). But since it's more of a personal view, I still give the DVD a 4 stars.",1313971200,4,783,4.7153284671532845
2441327,2,B000BTSJV2,"I put myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

This workout was just too easy for me.  I got halfway thru then quit and switched to another dvd.  Granted, I could work on my form more for some challenging moves but since they barely do a few reps of each, you don't really get to work at it (or get a workout so I don't know how you will really achieve weight loss with this.)

I tend to like pilates more than yoga since I feel like I am actively getting the burn like keeping your leg up and and making circles in the air rather than just holding a tough pose.  I'm not sure if there were more intense moves later in the workout but 15-20 minutes of waiting to get a workout isn't a workout I want to do again and again.

I tend to not like voice-overs (although, theoretically, I get that it is easier and higher quality audio than having the instructor gasping for air) and this is no exception.  What is especially off-putting, tho, is the sing-song intonation that goes with uuuuuupp or steeeetch as you do the move (as though I were saying it to you clearly over the phone) with no music. It's just plain weird . . . and annoying . . . and boring overall without some kind of music with a strong beat.

If you're just looking for a beginners relaxation/stretching/flexibility/ workout then this might work for you.",1287360000,5,1325,4.314516129032258
2441328,5,B000BTSJV2,"I like the regular workout and the quick one even more.  The quick one is 20 minutes and nicely fast paced.
Would definitely recommend.",1284076800,,135,4.625
2441329,5,B000BTSJV2,A friend recommended the Gaiam pilates videos with Ana Caban. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase. Very challenging without being overwhelming. Ana's style is encouraging yet laid back... just perfect in my opinion:),1277769600,,224,5.818181818181818
2441330,5,B000BTSJV2,"I started doing pilates again in Nov. '09 for the first time in about three years. I started with Gaiam's Mari Winsor pilates dvds and really enjoyed them. After doing them for about 6 months, I was ready for a change. I was very pleased with this Pilates for Weight Loss DVD. I wasn't looking to lose any weight, just looking to change things up a bit. I enjoy this DVD bc I like Ana Caban's style of teaching and she has just the right amount of enthusiasm and prompting. She not overly enthusiastic and bubbly but she definitely won't put you to sleep. This video is more fast paced than Mari Winsor and I really like that. It's a nice way to challenge yourself if you've been doing pilates at a slower pace. I think Mari Winsor is great for beginners (but she can also be great if you're more advanced) bc she moves at a slower pace and I realized after doing this Ana Caban DVD, that Mari Winsor gives your muscles a lot more to time recover in between exercises. This DVD, on the other hand, keeps you moving almost the whole time and really challenges your muscles and your core. Bottom line, I love this DVD. It's a little shorter than I would like for a longer workout but I feel like she does a good job of targeting all your muscles.",1275609600,4,1244,4.27542372881356
2441331,3,B000BTSJV2,"I wish someone would have mentioned that this is the same workout as on 5 Day Fit Pilates, which I already own. It's a nice 30-minute workout, and the production values/scenery is high quality, but I'm very disappointed. I was hoping for a more intense workout, and more variety on the ""bonus"" workout, but it was not to be. Boo.",1274832000,8,329,4.5
2441332,4,B000BTSJV2,This video is great for people with a basic Pilates skill level.  It keeps you moving and challenges you to take your routine to the next level.,1274572800,,144,4.333333333333333
2441333,4,B000BTSJV2,"This is a great workout but only if you already know the principles of pilates. It goes at a fast pace without time for figuring out the positions. It assumes that you already have a decent pilates background and remember to tighten up.
Those who say that this was too easy obviously have no idea about pilates and how it works. If you fall in that category please start with beginner level so you can understand it better. Every move, every breath in pilates has a purpose, there are many nuances that cannot bee seen by untrained eye, like holding the midsection tight and still, not rocking your hips while doing leg work, sitting straight up, lengthening your limbs as far as possible, etc. If you really want to get all the benefits that pilates offers take a class or get a beginner DVD. This workout is for high intermediate level.
The overall workout was similar to another Ana Caban DVD - Pilates Intermediate Level. She uses a lot of the same moves in the same sequence but at a higher pace and with addition of a few more challenging moves.
Unlike the Intermediate Level DVD she was using a soundtrack and her voice was a bit annoying. The music on the other hand was very calming and relaxing.",1270512000,21,1205,4.506849315068493
2441334,5,B000BTSJV2,"I like Ana Caban's style of instruction.  Relaxed and honest while still encouraging and challenging you.  She seems like a real person, and I find it more difficult to follow a routine if I can't connect with the person leading it.  As a person practicing pilates at an intermediate level, I thought the material on this DVD was great and ended up buying it after months of hanging onto my Netflix copy.  Even as I move on to more advanced routines I still use this one regularly because it makes me feel great.  Highly recommended.",1245542400,,533,4.568421052631579
2441335,5,B000BTSJV2,"This was my first Ana Caban pilates DVD.  I have all of the Crunch series pilates DVDs with Ellen Barrett and the Body Wisdom pilates for weight loss DVD.  So, I was pretty familiar with pilates exercises when purchased Ana's.

Ana's narration style is more energetic than I was prepared for but this is a more vigorous pilates workout and the narration style works.

It is a very fast-paced workout and not for beginners.  It has taken me a few repetitions to keep time with Ana.  It is quite challenging and I really work up a sweat.

Beware that if you are working out on a hard wooden floor (like me) you will probably need more than just a sticky mat to cushion your bones.  I use a sticky mat and blanket.",1242518400,2,711,4.333333333333333
2441336,5,B000BTSJV2,"Love this DVD because it gets your heart rate up due to the pace.  I have been doing another pilates DVD for months so was already familiar with the exercises.  I wanted to get something new but love the results I have gotten with pilates.  I would consider myself and ""intermediate"" level person when it comes to pilates and this DVD is perfect.  Can't do all the exercises yet but with practice know I will get there.  I also like the length (about 30 min).",1232236800,6,459,4.352941176470588
2441337,4,B000BTSJV2,"I use this DVD on days I just want focused pilates ab work.  While it is a whole-body routine, I don't consider it one of those ""complete workouts"" like the ones where you will get some cardio, strength and cool-down all in one.  This one is calm and focused...I think of it more as a supplement to my fitness regimine but not a crucial part.  That is not to say that this DVD isn't difficult; you will definitely feel this one the next day. It's great for what it is but not meant to be a DVD for weight loss as the name would suggest. But get it if you want to have a really strong, flat stomach.
Bonus: there is a storter routine included that is only about 15 minutes and there is even an audio version of it to take with you anywhere...pretty convenient.",1230336000,26,759,4.184931506849315
2441338,5,B000BTSJV2,"I own all of Ana Caban's pilates DVDs and this one is my favorite.  It is a great workout for a person who is experienced in pilates.  She doesn't pause to explain each position in detail which gives the workout a more fluid movement.  Great ab workout.  Whether you work out at home often or save it for rainy days, this DVD is perfect to get your exercise in at home!",1225929600,3,369,4.154929577464789
2441339,5,B000BTSJV2,I loves pilates and have bought/borrow many pilates tapes/DVDs.  Ana Caban is my favorite.  I would recommend this product to someone with experience.,1223683200,,150,5.478260869565218
2441340,5,B000BTSJV2,This is a wonderful Pilates workout to add to your collection.  I started this program to help tone up after having my first baby.  All I can say is I feel great after finishing - Ana incorporates great stretching moves with a fast paced core workout.  I also appreciate that there is a 15 minute bonus workout for days when you don't have time for the full one.  I will often do the bonus workout as a way to stretch and cool down after a cardio workout.,1206835200,,455,4.195402298850575
2441341,5,B000BTSJV2,"I love Ana Cabn's videos - I have her Intermediate Mat Workout video, her Pilates Body Band Challenge video, and now this Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss. I felt that I was ready to move-on from the intermediate workout, so after reading the reviews on this page I went ahead and ordered the video. I was not disappointed - this workout is a challenge! She incorporates all of the exercises from her intermediate video, but at a much faster pace, and she also introduces a few new exercises (crab, snake, one-legged Pilates push-ups, etc.) that will definitely take me a while to feel comfortable with. By the end of her intermediate video I would ""glisten"", but at the end of this maintenance video, I was definitely beginning to sweat! My heart rate was up for almost the entire 30 minutes, and I felt energized after the workout.

If you're ready to move on from Ana's intermediate video, this is a great video to try. Like the others have said, you must be comfortable and familiar with all of the exercises and be able to follow a quick pace, because Ana goes quite quickly from one move to the next.

The ONLY thing I don't like about this video is that she is not narrating in real-time like she is in her intermediate video. This video has Ana on a wooden platform on the beach, without her assistant Tara, and she does a voice-over narration while you watch her perform the exercises. I think she does this because the pace is quicker and she can go faster without having to talk through the workout, but I just prefer a real-time narration. This is only a minor drawback for me, however. It's still a great video!

I'd highly recommend this - it's fun, energizing, challenging, and like all of Ana Cabn's videos, stays true to the Pilates principles.",1204848000,8,1764,4.575949367088608
2441342,5,B000BTSJV2,"I have a VHS Windsor pilates video that I've been doing over and over again for about 4 years now.  That's all I've known in pilates. It was kind of a beginners video.  I decided to step up my workout and got on amazon to see all of the reviews to find something new.  I decided on this DVD and I think it's wonderful.  It is a perfect match for me.  It definitely is challenging in some spots but some moves are soothing and feel good.  I love the quicker pace it goes at - no time to rest in between each move which keeps my heartrate up.  I think Ana does a wonderful job and the voice (is it hers?) is very pleasant and easy to follow as far as the counting and breathing.  The main exercise workout takes place on a beach on a platform with just the water being shown in the background.  It's very calming and nice.  It's a good workout and I definitely feel it after I've finished.  It's just hard enough for me that I will be working on some of these moves for awhile before I master them.  I walk a 4 mile route about 5 or 6 times a week and this DVD is what I am going to supplement my workouts with a few times a week.  I think it's going to be effective for me and I'm anxious to see the results.  I think what I like best about this DVD is the quick pace of the workout. If you know your basic pilates moves, the quick pace should be no problem.",1204070400,2,1357,3.9411764705882355

2441345,5,B000BTSJV2,"While this is a low impact workout, it is far from a day at the beach. Ana Caban leads you through a series of challenging Pilates exercises designed to boost your metabolism. While you are burning calories you are also developing lean muscles and testing your endurance.

The exercises move at a rapid pace so there is no time for a beginner to learn the exercises. This was created for anyone familiar with Pilates and especially anyone who has been through the ""Quick Start Pilates for Weight Loss"" workout. Ana Caban provides enough variety to make this routine interesting for intermediate to advanced students of Pilates.

There are many traditional exercises like the hundred, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, swan, teaser, spine stretch forward, roll-up, corkscrew, plank, open-leg rocker, scissors, seal, Ronde de Jambe and neck pull. She also includes some new exercises (crab and snake) to test your creativity.

2441346,5,B000BTSJV2,"After two years of consistently working out, I was starting to get bored with my usual handful of pilates and yoga DVDs. I received ""Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss"" this past Christmas, and look out! This is a pretty tough 30 minute routine. Ana is great at cue-ing, but does move quickly (so beware!). Even though I like to consider myself pretty fit, my muscles were shaking during some of the moves so I knew I was really working. It's tough, but I'm looking forward to working at it until I can look as smooth and fluid as Ana does when she performs the exercises.

As a side note, my mom (who has never done pilates before) tried doing this DVD with me and it was way too advanced for her. I loaned her my beginner DVDs to work with until she tries this one again.",1171411200,16,774,4.301369863013699
