8583972,5,B00COGQTH6,"These horror shorts from around the world are unbelievable in vision. The first, a French Swiss production, features classic images of the devil, a man pulling a giant fish from the water (which holds a baby), and a mythos of both beautiful and terrifying proportions. The short from South Korea, by Hoyoung Im, is fantastic, which features vampires, and the 70's short, Cafe, seems like a black and white dream, directly out of the period. There is also an amazing Denmark short where a box sits in a newly rented apartment that holds much more than ghosts. The Canadian short is gorgeous, and truly creepy, and The Table, from the U.S., is terrifying, even if you suspect what might happen in the end. Watch these for some incredible short films, all in one compilation.",1375142400,,772,4.768656716417911
