2962849,4,B000W6Q1G4,If your gonna get these movies than get this. It's cheaper than buying them both individually and it's literally the exact same disc.  I personally enjoy both these movies for their cheesy factors. I feel like they're both lacking special features though. Python only has outtakes and no making of which disappointed me. Lake placid at least showed some behind the scenes of the movie. I actually kind of hope they make another Python movie. I mean he'll they made 4 lake placid movies. The quality on the movies is standard for DVD. But I would really like a bluray release of these movies some day in the future.,1357776000,,614,4.63302752293578
2962850,3,B000W6Q1G4,"(5.3) LAKE PLACID (1999) - Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, Betty White

Stan Winston's special effects bring to life a monster lurking in the depths of a dark lake.
At the beginning of this story set in Maine, the sheriff (Gleeson) pulls a diver out of the water whose lower half is completely gone. The man is still alive when brought into the boat, but not for long.

The creature responsible for his death is a 30-foot-long crocodile that an old lady (White) who lives on the lake has been feeding for six years, first with bits of bread when it was a baby and now with whole cows! There's some scary moments and some silly ones, but the comedy misfires more than it works.

Lake Placid is in the end a fairly brief and only so-so horror film.

(3.5) PYTHON (TV-2000) - Frayne Rosanoff, Robert Englund, Casper Van Dien, Jenny McCarthy, Wil Wheaton, Ed Lauter

Phillip J. Roth, author and producer of this very minor film, has a few dozen other schlocky TV frighters on his resum&eacute;.
The comedy here is strictly unintentional. Bad acting, a predictable and poorly written script, plus a 40-foot long on-the-cheap CGI serpent make this an absolute chore to sit through. The main appeal is watching a number of familiar actors getting killed by a critter that sometimes wriggles fast as lightning but always chases human prey at much more deliberate speeds.

Not worth the time it takes to load on your DVD player.

2962851,4,B000W6Q1G4,"Lake Placid is a wonderful movie for anyone that enjoys low-budgeted science-fiction with 30 foot crocodiles. I hadn't seen Python before, so of course that was a treat as well. Poorly made but entertaining, Python is good for the 13 year old boy in all of us. I wouldn't spend the money just for Python, but if given the chance to watch it on syfy, I'd put the remote down. I've watched Lake Placid 10 times since I got it (it turns out, that the company I bought the movies from, had mis-posted for the product and ended up only sending me Python. They refunded my money though, I got to keep Python and I found Lake Placid for cheap at a grocery store). Bill Pullman is his usual charming self, and Bridget Fonda plays the perfect role as a snobby New Yorker and Betty White's off-color humor as well as dirty language - makes the cast a big success. Ignore that this is not a Peter Jackson film, or some spectacular masterpiece, and focus on the character roles the actors play and just enjoy some good old-fashioned crocodile horror.",1253836800,,1038,4.468421052631579
