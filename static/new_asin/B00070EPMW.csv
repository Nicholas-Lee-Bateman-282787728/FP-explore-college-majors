8358007,4,B00070EPMW,"I have seen Nicole Johnson live and was hoping to get more of the comedic flare from her video. The messages are very good- truth that makes you really reflect, but not exactly what I was looking for. I still enjoyed the video and am not regretting the purchase.",1332288000,,262,4.36734693877551
8358008,5,B00070EPMW,"Nicole Johnson has a gift from God.  She inspires in a way that very few can.  It is amazing that these are sketches written that she is performing.  If you didn't know it, you would think that she actually is the character that she is portraying.  I particularly love the ""Invisible Woman"" sketch.  This DVD is so inspiring. My entire family watches it with me.  There is humor perfectly interwoven with drama.  This should be seen by all.",1263254400,2,440,4.564102564102564
