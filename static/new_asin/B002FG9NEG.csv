This DVD has different kinds of new age music, but it's mostly seeing videos of water flowing, nature landscapes & then suddenly a man or a woman in a yoga pose outside & then back to the nature videos. You do not see them going in or out of the pose either. There is no narration which is not relaxing to be staring at nature for several minutes & suddenly you're suppose to be in a modified bow pose.",1393632000,2,475,4.118279569892473
