8013618,4,B0001KNHGI,the movie is fair would not real bad but enjoyable for some people it is just a movie that will rember after a while,1406332800,,116,3.875
8013619,1,B0001KNHGI,Had some good intrigue and plot twist but some of the acting left much to be desired. Bai Ling once again proves you never know if she will act or smile her way through a movie.,1273622400,,177,3.9444444444444446
8013620,4,B0001KNHGI,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  Chad Allen was great and clearly a very talented young man.  He's not only handsome but has great presence on screen.  Bai Ling was great as well.  This was the second movie I have seen her in.  The first was ""The Crow"" and she is not only beautiful but you never know what's going on behind her eyes.  She's a mystery woman who keeps you guessing to the end.

This movie may not be for everyone but if you enjoy a good independent movie with twists in the plot, this might be for you.",1260835200,3,518,4.12
8013621,3,B0001KNHGI,"I'd have given it two stars cause the movie was so boring and pointless, but Chad takes his shirt off just often enough to make the show interesting. That and the movie is so bad it's funny made me give it three stars. I'd go on more, but I'd more but I'd not want to ruin it for you.",1252713600,,284,3.830508474576271
8013622,2,B0001KNHGI,"Paris has two great things to look at : Bai Ling and good digital video photography. The rest of the film is a boring ripoff of True Romance. Leon (James Russo),a crooked cop, is mistakenly  shot  by his partner Jason (Chad Allan) during a drug deal gone bad. Jason is devastated by the possibility that he may have paralyzed his mentor. In a vulnerable mind frame he agrees to Leon's request that he take the money from the dealers and deliver it to a woman named Linda (Bai Ling). Jason comes to find out that she is a beautiful Asian woman that Leon was seeing some time ago. The search for Linda takes Jason to numerous brothels and massage parlors. He doesn't find her but at one of the strip clubs he gets a little information from a seasoned prostitute named Chantal (Karen Black). Chantal thinks she knows where Linda is hiding and after she discloses that information to Jason she gives him a warning. She tells him to be careful of Leon. She tells him that he is a violent and dangerous man who should be feared. This scene is a little odd since Black vamps it up while outfitted in such a tight corset that pushes her bust up. Her sinister laugh is creepy as well. Jason finally finds Linda in a Vegas casino. He tells her that Leon has been hurt bad and that he wanted her to  have the money. A little apprehensive Linda takes the money and leaves that night. The next morning Jason is ready to come back home since he thinks his mission is complete but when Linda knocks on his hotel door fearing for her life he realizes that his problems have only just begun. Both the mob and the police are after Jason and Linda and the two start running for their lives. As they hide out at cheap motels the two  begin to fall for each other.  They plan on using their ill gotten gains to buy a place in Paris where they hope to  live happily ever after. This film wasn't that exciting and the story was too similar to True Romance. There were also a few odd touches like the Karen Black scene but also a cameo from Ron Jeremy. The only decent acting comes from Bai Ling who also provides some brief nudity. Female viewers may appreciate Chad Allan's  looks since they won't be impressed by his acting. The film benefits from it's DV photography which makes it a little grittier and more authentic but otherwise it is a fairly predictable crime thriller.",1211068800,10,2355,4.387614678899083
8013623,5,B0001KNHGI,"An EXCELLENT film.  Similar to ""The Transporter,"" but grittier, and not as much action.  This film focuses on the Asian sex trade in America.  Many of the scenes were filmed with a digital camera, which adds a very real feel to it. Considered film noir, this drama suspense, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A classy romance also unfolds.  Both Chad Allen and Bai Ling do an excellent job.  Filmed mostly in Vegas and the Nevada dessert.",1083628800,17,441,4.518987341772152
