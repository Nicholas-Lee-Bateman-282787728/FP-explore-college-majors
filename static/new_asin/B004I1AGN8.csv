4381541,4,B004I1AGN8,"First of all, I should confess that I have been a DBT fan for over 10 years.  This is somewhat depressing to admit, because it means I'm getting old.

This film was most interesting to me because of the subject: DBT.  You can't go wrong here if even if you only have a passing interest in rock and alt-country music.

As far as music documentaries go, this film has its flaws.  Its not terribly original, or original at all really.  It follows a tried, chronological music-mentary formula.  It has annoying cliche moments, like various people talking about how ""special"" the band and protracted shots through a rainy car window of ""the South.""  Worst of all, there are recurring interviews with an obnoxious American Studies professor from Temple University (yes, Temple) who talks about how ""great and political"" the band is.  The American Studies professor is very hard to sit through, I'll admit.

All that said, the subject of the band carries the film: Hood, Cooley and Isbell especially.  An added bonus is some interviews with the artist Wes Freed, who I adore.  Now, to be fair, I'll confess that I have always found Patterson Hood to be a bit obnoxious and annoying.  This film confirmed that for me, but it also reaffirmed Patterson's considerable appeal as a frontman.  Patterson is that now turned-man hyper-active chubby kid who continues to be overly critical about everything around him and driven by a desire to be seen as smarter than other people.  Still, Patterson seems to have a good heart so I don't hold his considerable self esteem much against him.  My attitude towards him is like what you may have towards some friends you grew up with.  You see their flaws, but still appreciate them for who they are.  I certainly think DBT would never have existed without Patterson and his overly wordy/crafted songs and his boundless ambition/ego.  Kudos to him.

Cooley is an enigma.  This film does not change that status, at all.  Like always, Patterson hogs most of the camera time but you have to suspect, that is the way Cooley prefers it.  I really consider Cooley to be one of the great songwriters and musicians of our generation.  ""Love Like This,"" ""Panties in Your Purse,"" ""Space City,"" ""Birthday Boy"" and, of course, ""Women Without Whiskey"" are all timeless American classics.  Whenever a new DBT album comes out, I admit, I skip to the Cooley songs and listen to them first.  The guy is a master.  Genius.

This film is most interesting because it provides a flashback to when Jason Isbell was in the band.  Isbell, who is much younger than Cooley and Hood, is an incredible talent.  You will probably hear alot about how this film documents the breakup of DBT and Isbell, but that is not true.  Its largely absent from the majority of the film and only discussed towards the end.  You never get a real answer why he was kicked out either.  There is no footage of fights or differences or any such things a la Wilco, only occasional narratorial heresay to that effect.  With that in mind though, it is still great to see footage of DBT when Isbell was with the band.  Say what you will about DBT post-Isbell, I like many folks, still believe that their two best albums were ""Decoration Day"" and ""The Dirty South.""  Isbell played a huge role in both those records and penned arguably the two best DBT songs, ""Outfit"" and ""God Damned Lonely Love.""  ""God Damned Lonely Love"" is just about the perfect song, in my opinion.

So, to conclude, don't think I'm a hater.  I still buy all the DBT and Jason Isbell records.  I even bought and enjoyed DBT's recent collaboration with Bettye Lavette and Booker T (the Booker T collaboration, by the way, is fantastic).  I really enjoyed watching this film, in short, because I'm a fan.  I think fans will get a major kick out of it.  Casual listeners and music appreciators may have a passing interest.  The documentary crowd, you'll find issues with it, but hey, I think Patterson would appreciate that critical gaze.  ha.  Enjoy.",1301443200,7,3996,4.701298701298701
4381542,5,B004I1AGN8,"""Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts"" is a great song line. In the mid '70's, a young Martin Scorese threw The Band up the ""Rockumentary Pop Chart"" with his gold standard film, The Last Waltz. Film maker Barr Weissman does a similar job here, some 35 years later as Scorsese did for The Band. Barr had inside access to The Drive-By Truckers that no one had before him (or since for that matter) DBT liked and trusted Barr. And Barr trusted them. This is not a fanzine puff piece. This film gives great insight into what makes humans acting out life as musicians are really made of. There are tremendous universal truths here. Politics, race, romance..the hard stuff..handled gracefully and deftly through the truthful guidance of the lens in Mr. Weissman's hands and eyes. Do not buy this if you want to view a film about a rock band. This goes waaay beyond that level. Deeper into the Paul Simon song..""Boy in the Bubble"", Simon writes..""These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all""  Thanks Barr. ""The camera follows us in slo-mo"" indeed!",1300665600,4,1146,4.563106796116505

Thanks for all the good memories. My daughter AVA even loves you guys. Now I'm off to see Isbell tonight, this day couldn't get better!

4381544,5,B004I1AGN8,"This DVD chronicles the ups and downs of the band from beginning(circa 1990)through 2008 at the release of their first post-Isbell album release, Brighter Than Creations Dark.

The film gives insights behind the stories told in the songs and takes a look at where each member grew up. (Muscle Shoals, AL)

You get highlights of the history of Muscle Shoals music scene, everyone from the Rolling Stones to Little Richard to Bob Dylan recorded albums there.

The Drive-By Truckers are admittedly my favorite band and I try to get my hands on every piece of material they release so I will always lean towards wanting to speak positively of them, however this film goes beyond just being for loyal fans as myself and is just a good Rock N Roll story.

I recommend it to people who love rock or documentaries or even American history because there's a little bit of all of it in this DVD.",1299110400,5,885,4.617834394904459
4381545,4,B004I1AGN8,"As a Truckers fan there is no doubt you are going to love this.  Order it without question.  For me, I am an avid doc fan and really enjoy music docs, even when I never heard of the band.  Coming from the outside this does leave a little to be desired.  The insert that comes with the DVD has vocalist/guitarist Patterson Hood explaining this is not meant to be a ""Behind the Music"" tell all, which is important to note before you buy.  A majority of the doc explains Patterson's family roots in the music industry, shows Patterson with his family now, and has Patterson explaining what his songs are about.  The other members of the band aren't as open.  The Jason/Shonna divorce drama gets glossed over for instance.  You will get a good understanding of the band, but most people who are going to buy this know a large portion of it.",1298937600,7,836,4.4183006535947715
4381546,5,B004I1AGN8,"There have been a lot of band documentaries over the years, but this is simply one of the best. You feel like a fly on the wall watching the Truckers and their families and friends (as well as fans), tell their stories. Barr Weissman has done a fantastic job putting this all down on film. If you are a DBT fan, you won't hesitate a second to buy this. If you have even a remote interest in how a band gets some success and deals with it and creates its music, watch this documentary!",1297209600,17,484,4.159574468085107

4381588,5,B004I1AGN8,"This is a very good, very well presented, documentary, about the history & story, of the Southern, ""Rock"" &/or ""Americana"", Band - ""The Drive-By-Truckers"". This is truly a fairly lengthy, legetimate documentary as told by Patterson Hood himself, along with other band members, and Pat's Mom & Dad. During the documentary there are some samples of the band's live performances. This documentary is very interesting, it is not at all boring. This documentary covers the DBT's through about 2008. I love the way Patterson Hood, tells stories. His, and the other band members' story telling, legacies, continue, in this documentary, just like the stories, they tell,in their songs. This is a ""must-have"", for any DBT fan, and I am certainly a DBT fan.

I just read an article about this documentary dvd, in the current issue of ""American Songwriter"" Magazine, and they state, this documentary is ""like a picture & story"" of the DBT's up through about 2008. This covers back when band members, Jason Isabell & Shonna Tucker were married. They divorced, but the band survived. This dvd covers the whole story, about how the DBT's survived, hardships as well as triumpts.  I was hoping to find out more about the song ""18 Wheels of Love"", from their Austin City Limits DVD, but somehow that part got left out, however, there is more than enough other information to make up for this. The things that are covered, are covered very well, like Shonna's & Jason's marriage & divorce. Plus, I loved Patterson's great story about the ""Living Bubba"", with actual footage of the ""living Bubba"", performing, not long before his death.

This documentary, not only covers the band's story & history, but also, it includes a good, socio-economic, story & history, of the ""deep"" American South, and how it has changed.

Also, you get some great, previously unreleased, live performances, as bonus material.

If you like the DBTs, you'll love & enjoy this very good, documentary, along with the bonus, live performances. Thanks!!!!",1301788800,10,2010,5.005988023952096
