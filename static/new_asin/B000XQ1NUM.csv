A sci-fi thriller about an experiment gone awry, resulting in a murder mystery that veers between 1937 Los Angeles and the present day. An intelligent look at reality versus manipulated perception, where one is forced to question everything.

8229122,1,B000XQ1NUM,"I find the 1999 film, The Thirteenth Floor, to be a terrific sci fi yarn. However, if you order this film on DVD what you get instead is an indie film set in Mumbai.

Bait and switch - unintentional, I'm sure, but beware.",1417824000,,221,4.1395348837209305
8229123,1,B000XQ1NUM,"I ordered The Thirteenth Floor with Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol.  You sent me Thirteenth Floor, an IndieFlix, though they don't lay claim to it.  Neither does anyone else that I have been able to find.

When I received the original email from Amazon about my order I noticed the cover was different, it is red, but thought nothing of it as that does happen.  I wanted to make sure it was the right movie before I opened it so I could return it if it wasn't.  On the back the movie description says 2 people are stuck in an elevator and spend time talking. The movie I ordered is about a computer generated matrix that the creators of it learn to enter and do some mischief.  The folks in the hologram think they're real.

There is nothing on the Internet about a second movie with that title. Even IndieFlix say they have no movie with that title.  After two weeks I clicked on the movie listed in the original email from Amazon.  I was taken to Amazon where the same red cover was on view.  I scrolled down and read what the movie was about.  Two people are stuck in an elevator in Mumbai.  I scrolled down farther to the reviews.  They're about the movie I ordered.  Nothing to do with an elevator. Back to the top where I clicked on the red movie.  Another page comes up with a pic of the proper movie that I ordered.  Again I scroll down to read the description and it is correct - a Science Fiction story about people who think their world is real.  Down to the reviews - they're the same reviews for the other movie but they match this movie.

By now I'm convinced that there is only one movie and someone put the wrong cover on the DVD so I open it.  This is the worst movie I have ever tried to watch.  Two people stuck in an elevator all night talking about their mundane lives.
I hurried to Movies Unlimited to get a copy there, even though it was more expensive, but they are out of the regular DVDs.  You only have it as used.  And I am stuck with the joke of the year.  Which I actually paid for.",1415836800,4,2011,4.1796875
