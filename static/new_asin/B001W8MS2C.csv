8347225,4,B001W8MS2C,"THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS THE STAR POWER- ASIA ARGENTO AND WILLAM DEFOE. HE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER, NO MISTAKE. BUT ASIA IS FEATURED, BUT NOT LIKE SHE SHOULDA/COULDA BEEN. DONT WANNA RUIN ANYONES WATCHING OF THIS- LETS JUST SAY IT REVOLVES AROUND A STIP CLUB. AND ASIA IS SINGLED OUT TO DO A "" SPECIAL "" ROUTINE. THATS THE EXTENT OF HER PARTICIPATION. SHE SAYS VERY LITTLE ELSE. BUT THE STORY IS FAMILIAR. THE ENDING YOU KINDA SEE COMING. IN THE END, NOT A BAD SHOW, NOT WORTH THE $28 I SPENT. WAIT TILL IT DROPS BELOW $20 OR SO, AS IT INVARIABLY WILL.",1286409600,,565,4.2407407407407405
