7887643,5,6305319367,"As we remember from the last DVD, Ash and Misty are venturing through Viridian Forest.
Following the game, they should reach Pewter Town now, right.
Nah, not yet. Looks like we have to slow down a bit, or the show'll be over in 30 episodes.
So, they're still in Viridian Forest. Ash meets a pokemon trainer named Samurai (uh..), who want a fight after losing to Gary earlier. The fight turns out to be a bore-fest where Ash's and Samurai's Metapods harden a few dozen times. It ends with a bucnh of Beedrills kidnapping Metapod. Woo, finally rid of him. Now to get rid of Pikachu, and catch some good pokemon. Nah, Ash embarks on a rescue mission, but is attack by J&J who want Pikachu. They end up getting attacked by more Beedrills, while Metapod defend Ash. The experience evolves him into Butterfree, a pokemon even worse than Pikachu. Blah.
Well, Ash and Misty continue their journey, and reach Pewter City, where Ash decides to enter the Pokemon League. To enter, he has to travel between cities and towns, challenging the local pokemon master in a battle and win. This'll give him a badge to brag about. Get 8 badges, and you can enter the league. Ash challenges the local master, Brock, but is easily beaten. An old man named Flint, who turns out to be Brocks father, helps Ash super-charge Pikachu making him win. Almost. Ash gets the chanse to cheat, but turns it down. Brock hands him the badge anyway, and joins him on the journey. On the way to the next town, Cerulean, Ash and co journey through Mount Moon, where they meet a scientist named Seymour, and stop Jessie and James from stealing the mysterious Moon Stone from the Clefairies, a very rare species of pokemon. The stone is supposed to evolve pokemon into otherwise unattainable forms, making it very useful for Team Rocket. Ash and co don't succeed, however, and J&J get away with the stone. The Clefairies stop them with a bit help from Brock's Onix, use the Moon Stone to evlve, and beat up the Rocket agents. Turns out the stone was a bit more powerful than they thought.
So, what do we have here? 3 very good episodes, each deling with a different pokemon species. The first one cover the Weedle/Kakuna/Beedrill family, then we have Brock's pokemon, Geodude and Onix. And finally, Clefairy and Clefable.
Can't really say much else, cept that these are among the best episodes at this point in the series, and I recommend this DVD to all fans.",1058313600,5,2420,4.617169373549884

Also, Misty is still following Ash around for the money he owes her for the bike he distroyed.
