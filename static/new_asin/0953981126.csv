172292,5,0953981126,"John Cope does a first class job of teaching, step-by-step, the art of Didge playing.  Very clear and instructive.  He also informs us about the lore and culture of the Didgerigoo and shows us many examples of the instrument.  PVC, bamboo, and different woods are demonstrated at the beginning of the video.  It definitely helps in helping you pick your instrument. One can even practice the different techniques along with Mr. Cope by pausing the video.  It is fun and entertaining as well as instructive.  I highly recommend it.",1322438400,10,530,4.898876404494382

Not only do you receive a demonstration of several sounds and rhythms, but also a visual demonstration showing the actual lip and tongue movements prior to playing them through the instrument.",1285891200,15,257,4.976744186046512
172294,5,0953981126,"I have a collection of Didgeridoo instructional DVDs and CDs and I rate this as one of the best.  Most stop at beginner technics and possibly lead you into a basic rhythm or two, but this DVD takes you there and beyond.  The first five minutes of the presentation made me question if I was going to like it or not, but once the instructor began teaching, I was very pleased.  This is a very good purchase and I would highly recommend it.",1275782400,23,437,4.240963855421687

7793612,5,0953981126,"Helped out so much in play the didgeridoo! I purchased a didgeridoo at Guitar Center and couldn't play that much for that long. Now, not only can I play the didgeridoo, but now I can add the variations that make the instrument unique. I especially like the 5 Engine theory that he teaches. This instructional DVD will make your didgeridoo performing exceed beyond the beginning player.",1326672000,7,385,4.848484848484849
7793613,5,0953981126,I am very happy with this product. The instructor is very helpful from the first steps to the more difficult sounds and rythms. The material is taught at a pace that both progresses quickly but also allows you to pause and master one skill at a time. This is the first instructional tool I have used to learn the didgeridoo and it will probably also be the last.,1326499200,5,362,4.338235294117647
