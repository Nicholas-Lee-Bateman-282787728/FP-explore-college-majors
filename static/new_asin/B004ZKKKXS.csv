4509897,5,B004ZKKKXS,"I'm finally starting to enjoy the new incarnation of Garfield with it's CGI animation style. I only wish they would release a full season instead of six 11 minute episodes to one DVD, when the actually episodes that aired on TV were 22 minutes with two segments. I'm a Garfield fan and I still buy every DVD that comes out, at least the Spooky Tales was under ten dollars.

The episodes are:

Orange and Black

The Robot

It's a Cat World

Time Master

Virtualodeon

Mastermind

Bonus: Garfield Shorts

All the episodes on Spooky Tales are cute and kids will enjoy watching around Halloween!",1346976000,3,591,4.660194174757281

The latest DVD Spooky Tails will definitely get you in the Halloween Spirit.

The Garfield Show: Spooky Tail Synopsis:
Follow the witty and silly duo as they run into spooky trouble again! It's all fun and games for Garfield and Odie as they take a fun-filled trip on Halloween until Garfied is mistaken by a loose wild cat!
Includes other out-of-this-world adventures.

This DVD features 6 colorful, funny, adorable episodes of Garfield, Odie, John and the gang.

The Garfield Show: Spooky Tails will be released to buy on August 23rd. You can pre-order your copy today from Amazon for $11.99.

Our favorite is called The Robot, where Garfield and Odie work together to rid the house of a very special vacuum cleaner set on removing them. As some who likes watching cartoons 45, I can tell you this was a fun review. What I love the most about The Garfield Show is how colorful and truly funny it is.  We have watched this DVD three times since we received it and it is still funny.",1313452800,2,1154,4.524038461538462

8450106,5,B004ZKKKXS,"Want a Halloween treat? Then, grab your bags of trick-or-treating candy and join Garfield in this 4th DVD with superb CGI animation of ""The Garfield Show"".  Oh yes, Garfield's mouth actually moves as he talks throughout this epic series which brilliantly enhances his personality and character. Of course, all Garfield fans out there will agree that he is just too adorable.

In this DVD you will meet the real Catzilla as he breaks out from the zoo. Jon gets a new cleaning robot but it becomes too violent around Garfield, Odie and Jon. Garfield gets sucked into a ""parallel universe"". Garfield finds a pocket watch which stops time (sounds like a Twilight Zone episode). Garfield discovers a new 3D format TV channel (a Nickelodeon parody) and ends up in the television. Garfield gets a device that reads people's minds while the adventure begins at Vito's pizzeria with rioting aliens.

The 4th Volume of this stellar series is well worth the ride. So grab your copy before it slips into the Twilight Zone!",1391731200,3,1010,4.8604651162790695
