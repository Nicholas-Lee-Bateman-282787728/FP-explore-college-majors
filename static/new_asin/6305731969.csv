7894169,5,6305731969,"A Great movie series, This should be the standard for all erotica movie's. The quality and the movie content did not disappoint.  All 7 releases are well worth watching, but the best four are the first 3 (I,II,III) and Emmanuelle 7.",1494979200,,232,4.658536585365853

7894171,5,6305731969,"Monique Gabrielle, former penthouse pet, stars in this installment of the Emmanuelle saga as she is swept off to a Sheik's harem from her yacht. Found this film well done, and, even a little fun. It's a nice diversion. I can recommend it for just that reason.",1458259200,,259,4.531914893617022
7894172,5,6305731969,"This is for the memories.  Cinemax late at night, just a terrible story, but there is something about it.",1435795200,,105,4.526315789473684

7894175,1,6305731969,"Disappointing to say the least. Bad acting, sub-titles are not what the actors are saying, but then who cares... 'cause what the actors are saying isn't worth listening to. Save your money (and your time) and just purchase additional copies of the original and Emmanuelle 2 with Sylvia Kristel.",1349049600,,294,5.020408163265306
7894176,3,6305731969,"A bit old school and the plot sucks, got's nakedness abound in it if thats all you want, blah blah blah",1314748800,2,103,3.9523809523809526
7894177,3,6305731969,"the only thing that i liked about this film is the scene between the two women from the middle east behind the curtain that the Sheik ripped apart. a good 20-25 seconds of pure lesbian lust...before the camera pans back to the Sheik again! i'm appalled at how mainstream the film tries to be. for me, part of the Emmanuelle success was showcasing a woman with a sexual appetite no matter who it was from: man or woman. yet, with the Emmanuelles that followed in Kristel's footsteps, somewhere along the way the series became nothing but a sophomoric, naughty movie one might expect to find late at night on the USA Network back in the early '90s with Gilbert Gotfreid with zero titilation and sexual overtones...but heavy on bikini clad bimbos. Laura Gemser has been the ONLY other woman to successfully play this role...and her films are MORE explicit than Kristel's. Emmanuelle 5 came along in 1987 as just another skin flick...showing hardly any skin. the mood for me is always interrupted by the so-called 'hero' of the film who's trying to break Emmanuelle out of the Sheik's harem! if it were me, i'd re-record the lesbian scene on a blank tape and throw Emmanuelle 5 out the window.",1076544000,11,1189,4.69377990430622
7894178,4,6305731969,"the exotic locales and beautiful women accent the storyline. particularly impressive is the use of camera angles. for an erotic movie that actually has a plot, be sure to check this one out.",979948800,9,190,4.787878787878788
