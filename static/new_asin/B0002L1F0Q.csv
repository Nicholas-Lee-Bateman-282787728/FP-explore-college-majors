When I copied the demo projects to my computer.  None of them would run or even open in Visual Studio 2005 and none could be converted.  The email address on the DVD is a dead link.  I did a search and found his website.  I sent him an email to ask what the problem was, which he ignored.",1181260800,,525,4.252525252525253
8028772,3,B0002L1F0Q,"This is not the best production and the presentation is, as another reviewer put it, ""City College"".  But, it is what it is...an inexpensive DVD  training course that exposes you to all the basics.  Its exactly what I needed as an experienced VB developer to get into VB.NET database access.

If you are shallow and cannot look past the presentation for the content provided then this DVD is not for you.  If you can sift through the minor inconsistancies and meandering presentation style, which most of us do on a daily basis with users and business analysts, then snap this baby up.

It's like having a private leassons with your own personal expert. Rick Dobson's style of teaching is clear and simple. After you go through all the leasons you will be able to understand and use VB.NET and ADO.NET in real world applications. I have read more then a few books on this topic but when you have somebody speaking to you and explaining it like he is here... that's something different. I learned more from this DVD then from any other book. My favorite sections of this DVD are labs where you can test everything you learned.
Chapters
Every chapter begins with a few Power Point slides where Rick gives you some basic facts about what you'll learn. Then he explains everything you need to know and after that you go in a ""code mode"" where he explains everything you learned in code. He will guide you through the code and explain everything you need to know in order to build the aplication on your own.
Way to go DV Press! I'm expecting more titles in DVD format and as good as this one.",1078444800,8,1215,4.404444444444445

  This DVD is the single best source I have found for learning .Net-related technologies. Based on the quality of this DVD's content, I plan on purchasing several of DVPress's upcoming titles. After viewing this program, I realized that DVPress may be effectivly on their way to replacing the developer's racks of programming books with DVD cases!
  The DVD has been designed to serve both as a full-length course as well as a reference for later on. I would prefer to carry around ten DVDs than ten 500-page books! Rock on DVPress, your products will no doubt better my career as a developer for now and hopefully as a architect/project manager later on!
Sincerely,
Derek Comingore
