If you have ever read any of my other reviews you would know that I got this movie based on the fact that Kurupt is in it. With that being said, this film is not really all that great. I had high hopes going into this film based primarily on the cover; the girl on the front is amazingly hot. It turns out that same girl never even looks like that in the film; the cover makes her look like she is straight out of ""Sin City"". Unfortunately the film is never as good as that film, but I guess for an independent film it is ok.

Writers Myer Grovic and Brian Mazo did come up with a good concept; in fact the story line is really good. The story is about a couple that attempts to rob a bank after the girl gets cut off by daddy dearest. After that they high jack an ambulance to try to escape from the police. The first part did not get enough time to develop and seems like it comes to fast, the last part how ever is where the story gets really good. That is how ever where the film shows its other flaws, namely the lead actress.

Amanda Brooks is a stuck up prissy British rich girl who hates her mother, who is trying to take care of her. She at the same time loves her father who is just buying her love; he decides to make her grow up and rightfully cuts her off. She throws a temper tantrum and try's to act tough. It is when she acts like this that Amanda's performance is the weakest, especially when she is performing opposite of Kurupt. She try's really hard to act ""hood"" and ""street"" just because of who is in the ambulance with her. The performance was not only weak but that shows the weakness in the character, so why would anybody get behind an annoying character like that. Thomas Ian Nicholas is slightly less annoying in his role as her boyfriend who is just there for her money, but to his credit it is just his character that is bad, not his acting, when he is freaking out is hilarious. Malcolm McDowell and Faye Dunaway are great in their roles of her parents, both of which deliver really good performances. The guys that play the cops are great and really entreating, as were the two that played the ambulance doctors. Clint Howard is great as usual as the ambulance driver, and so was the guy who played the drug dealer. Last but not least is Kurupt, who as usual gives a great performance. He plays Joker a man who was just stabbed and is on his way to the hospital in the ambulance that the girl high jacks. Not only is he funny in this role but you will literally cheer for him and laugh at the same time when he puts Amanda's character in her place when he gets dropped off with his people. That was my favorite part of the entire film, especially after I witnessed the ending of this movie

Directors Gino Cabanas and Dick Fisher did a good enough job on this film, the only real problem with this film is Amanda Brooks's performance in most scenes. I can see why some people will like this movie, but at the same time I will also understand why some won't. Me personally, I think that the movie is good especially for an independent film. I think you will agree as well if you can get over some of the annoying parts of this film.",1216339200,4,3172,4.18657937806874
