8595476,5,B0018CWW2S,"Did I just die and go to heaven?  Or was I watching Agarradinhos, a DVD by Leila Pinheiro and Roberto Menescal?  It had to be the DVD -- heaven couldn't be that good.  In the intimacy of her studio in Rio, Leila and Roberto perform a fabulous collection of songs, most composed by him and a couple featuring lyrics written by her.  It's just the two of them, her on her piano, him on his guitar, both of them playing an understated they've-got-it-just-right accompaniment to her superb voice.  What class!  What talent!  And although the beauty of the Portuguese language is such that this American could thoroughly enjoy these songs without understanding a word, the optional subtitles reveal the sheer poesy of the songs they've chosen for this album.  If I had to sum up this album in a word, it would be exquisite.",1471219200,,818,4.631944444444445
