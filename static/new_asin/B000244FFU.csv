But there is a little sadness: as a foreign customer I would like to have subtitles, in fact I was so sure about subtitles. Now I'm a little sad. But it's simply a Musthave for Janeites.",1096416000,5,361,4.1571428571428575
2061173,5,B000244FFU,"Let's quickly ammend what the previous reviewer said!  First of all, this is an excellent DVD collection of excellent quality. The pictures are all crystal clear, the sound is striking, and the acting is fantastic.  BBC and Warner Brothers did a fabulous job of remastering these films from the 70's and 80's and I am thrilled I bought the whole set.  You can also buy each movie separately.  As for side B of certain movies, the disc specifically says right on it ""blank disc.""  This is because on some of them, the entire movie fits on the first side, thus side B is obviously unused.  If the previous reviewer actually watched the movies, they would see that nothing is missing, so let's hope they give their collection another try!  I for one am so glad I finally own these older, and more definitive version of Jane Austen's amazing works.  Enjoy it, as I have and will continue to do so!",1094169600,360,893,4.5375

2061231,3,B000244FFU,"I really liked this collection of movies, but a few of the DVDs had whole chapters that would not play. For instance, if a title was broken into seven chapters, chapters 1,2,5,6, and 7 would play but chapters 3 and 4 didn't seem to exist. Whenever I clicked those chapters the DVD would freeze and go back to the main menu, or as chapter 2 ended it skipped to chapter 5. This happened on several DVDs.

If you love Jane Austen stories, you would love this set. I have other versions of these stories, but it is fun to have different versions of something you love. These DVDs are a BBC mini series and are a little slower than some movies.  They do tend to end each story a little fast, but they are still good.

2061236,2,B000244FFU,"This is a big sigh for me. But, I understand why these were so disappointing. I am used to a 2017 mentality when it comes to the way the women in Austen novels are depicted onscreen. Some of the actors in these productions barely raised an eyebrow. No spirit. At the end of Mansfield Park, the moment you've been waiting for, the heroine and her true love take the dog for a walk out on the lawn. Passion anyone? Even just a sweet kiss? Nah. Let's walk the dog.
That's not to say there weren't some good performances here and there, but fed a diet of more recent productions, I was left hungry, hardly sated. Glad I watched them because I love Austen, but not thrilled. And, I wanted to be!",1489622400,,690,4.2748091603053435

2061279,1,B000244FFU,My one star is not for the actual PBS productions.  It is for the manufactured product.  This was supposed to be a replacement for the same thing I ordered several weeks ago that was defective.  The Emma and Mansfield Park DVDs in the original order were defective.  They froze and skipped big chunks.  I asked for a replacement which Amazon immediately sent out before they got my return.  This is the replacement and the same two DVDs were defective in the same areas.  There was obviously a problem in the manufacturing process for those two DVDs in the boxed set.  I am not going to return this set like I did the other one.  I am going to buy Emma and Mansfield Park separately and hope they are not defective.

They're an acquired taste but (with the exception of 1987's Northanger Abbey), these adaptations are faithful and well acted.

2061340,2,B000244FFU,"Sense & Sensibility:  One Star.  Unwatchable. Wooden acting, cardboard characters, painfully flat lighting, poor ""As The World Turns""-level camerawork and directing, but the thing that really kills this is the poor sound quality.  It sounds like a '70's cassette recorder used in a YMCA shower, from 15' away.  The rooms are ""hot"" with hard plaster walls, and the sound guy didn't know enough to put in acoustical curtains.  You cnq't mrka aouf zwah wrkdz.  It felt like one of those fever dreams where you know the characters are saying something important, but you can't understand it and it just goes on and on.  I would rather watch ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"".  Do yourself a favor and get the Colin Firth version of ""Pride and Prejudice"".

2061365,5,B000244FFU,"Though these BBC-TV series are not cinema quality, they are a collector's delight true to Austen and in crystal-clear beautifully articulated dialogue of more of Austen's original verbiage than usually performed, as well visual historical authenticity so perfectly reproduced that you feel transported in time. In order of my preferences:

1) SENSE & SENSIBILITY ~ truer to the novel than the later modernized version with Kate Winslet & Emma Samms, this is my FAVORITE RENDITION of S&S also thanks to the actress portraying the main character I am delighted also portrays:

2) PRIDE & PREJUDICE character Charlotte Collins memorably in this series, too, though in this version of P&P, Elizabeth Bennett is more comely than her amiable but supposed-to-be ""fairest of them all"" eldest sister Jane Bennett (still enjoyable since we see more of the most beautiful & lively, Lizzie), but all the other characters are marvelously cast & memorably developed.

3) EMMA's heroine is more sympatico & likeable than later mimic by American actress Gwyneth Paltrow, or even British Kate Beckinsale version; and this production is as animatedly enjoyable as it is true to the novel.  Usually I rate PERSUASION higher than EMMA, so it says a lot that in this set I like EMMA better.

4) PERSUASION ~ truer to the novel than other versions, but this heroine--though beautiful like American actress Jean Simmons, elegant, & an encouragement to senior romance like I've enjoyed in life and was ready to embrace this rendition--seems a bit too old, tired, & faded emphasized by the male romantic lead bringing more vitality & lightness to the part than  usual. This version is most realistic of the more natural & less sophisticated times, like the Thomas Hardy novel movie ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" with Julie Christie & Peter Finch, or the more recent ""Lost in Austen.""  I prefer the Amanda Root version of PERSUASTION, also on Amazon.

5) Though MANSFIELD PARK's lead actress is unengagingly homely & subservient, the others are all well cast & the production as well done as the other five in this tale a successor of Grimm's Fairy Tales' Cinderella and a forerunner to Charlotte & Anne Bronte and Charles Dickens.

6) NORTHANGER ABBEY is the only Jane Austen I can never like, made worse by this modernly British horror style barely cloaked in retro garb & settings, as well as the provokingly unattractive lead actress and her apparel & hairstyles. But the romantic male lead & his sister are a winning respite; and it offers some William Makepeace Thackery ""Vanity Fair"" quality & philosophizing on the times, making some classically thought-provoking points despite the noir setting.

It helps to know Jane Austen also wrote a satire of Ann Radcliffe's sensationalist gothic horror novels purchased by the same publisher but never printed lest it detract from Radcliffe popularity, helping me think Jane intended the Northanger novella along the same vein (pun intended).  While it exposes vulnerability & foolish susceptibility of the young, and residual cultural feudal mercenary use of females as chess piece assets aka chattel, this rendition goes too far for classic tastes, in its gratuitously bloody imagery and requiring empathy I don't share with the main character's pursuit of evil thrills foreshadowing our current world's descent from the influence of European/American Christian heights of civilization we love to experience through classic literature like Jane Austen's, which I don't consider this novella of that caliber, & unlike the rest of this well presented series, this DVD will be rarely viewed by me.",1423958400,12,3619,5.158703071672355

The top two for me are Mansfield and Emma, because they are more detailed and are well acted. S & S, P & P and Persuasion were not bad; they are at least an escape from this day of graphic, highly intense forms of so called entertainment. I detest this version of Northanger Abbey for the portrayal of her fantasies (embarrassing to me) and the scenes in the ""bath"" in Bath are just weird to me, like a depressing surreal moment; and frankly, I don't like some of the actors.

In conclusion, though they're not top notch quality in some aspects, I have found myself watching them many times and just letting them play in the background for a restful atmosphere.",1421712000,,755,4.510948905109489

Since I am a US. citizen, I must admit that most of the actors in this set of dvds were not known to me, however, I imagine most would be at least familiar, if not well-known to individuals who live in the UK.

If one is looking to add to their Jane Austen media library, this is a good set to purchase.  The set contains:

I think I have viewed most, if not all, of the movie adaptations of Austen's novels, and these remain my favourites -- although Colin Firth's Darcy beats out this one. All of these versions were done in the '70s, so they cannot be held to the standard -- digital, HD, etc. -- we've come to expect today. They did not have the technology back then, but what they have is a truer presentation and understanding of Austen's work. Odd hairstyles, bonnets, costuming and static camera angles should be only minor distractions.

The others do not suffer, either. I much prefer these multi-hour editions over the rushed, too modern movie versions (and of course over the horrendous old black and white ones that didn't even follow the correct story).

However, one learns that the BBC has a number of different versions of the Austen books out and they are not all created equal. This set with productions ranging from 1971 to 1987 is generally irritating and soap opera-ish because most of the scenes are shot live on a sound stage. The only one that we could actually watch to the end was Northanger Abbey which was mostly filmed on location and is the last made in the collection.

2061558,5,B000244FFU,"Jane Austen's superb novels of romance, comedy, and even mystery are a perpetual source of inspiration for TV and the movies.  This BBC collection features all six of her published novels, digitally remastered from television productions from the 1970's and 1980's.  Production values are quite good, with period settings and lots of location shooting in English country houses and gardens.  The actors may be unknown to present-day viewers, but the stories are generally well-cast and well-acted. The television mini-series format allows for a fairly complete presentation of each novel, with lengths ranging from 90 minutes for ""Northanger Abbey"" to over five hours for ""Mansfield Park.""

Among the highlights of the collection is an excellent rendition of ""Pride and Prejudice"", widely considered Austen's masterpiece.  A strong cast captures the rocky road to romance for the spirited young Lizzie Bennet and her would-be lover, the wealthy and prejudice Mr. Darcy.  ""Manfield Park"" may be the most challenging of Austen's novels, featuring a less-obvious heroine in a trial of moral strength.  The very effective versio here is the most faithful to the original novel this reviewer has seen.  This ""Emma"" clearly sets the tone for its multiple successors with its titular heroine's clueless efforts at matchmaking in a small English village.

BBC's ""Jane Austen Collection"" is very highly recommended to her fans as entertaining and quality productions of her novels.",1324857600,2,1472,5.4493392070484585

Even though they lack directorial presence, the actors in most of these stories are very persuasive as their characters, especially the supporting ones.  Northanger Abbey was the least pleasing; it was as corny as a high school production.  Pride & Prejudice was the best one because of the great cast; this is the one in which the supporting cast is better than all of the other versions I've seen, especially the mother.

Even as an original idea, completely divorced from Austin's novel, it was terrible.  Slave trade, debauchery, etc. -- pathetic.)  Emma, in my opinion, was the best of the bunch, one of the best Emma's actually that I've seen.

I did not like the latest ""Emma"" with Gweneth Paltrow. The whole thing was very poorly done.
The acting was not as good as the actors reputation would lead you to believe. The version
wth Kate Beckinsale was more on the target of the times, as well as the great sauciness
of the character. In the latest version Gweneth Paltrow sometimes seemed to be at a loss
as to what she was to say. The spritely sauciness was missing as well. Incidently I do like
the BBC DVDs. I like the fact that you can have subtitles on or off. Being somewhat hard
of hearing, I have the subtitles on most of the time.",1269734400,,686,4.2846153846153845
2061598,5,B000244FFU,"I recommend Jane Austen for a study of the virtues in a really delightful way. It's so easy to get into these stories and really care what happens to the characters that you hardly notice that you're being reminded of how true quality does not come from wealth, although happily, it doesn't necessarily exclude the wealthy. These are not tragic stories and true love and virtue seem to win in the end.

A true Jane Austen fan will read the books, watch the DVDs, and then watch other versions, to compare them and see which make the books come alive.  This version pleases me. I have enjoy and continue to enjoy each and every one.

There are other thoughtful reviews, so I'll just give my own short rundown. Read the other reviews for more details or, better still, experience them yourself and develop your own opinions.  :)

As a young girl, Pride and Prejudice was my favorite. A young person today might prefer Northanger Abbey, because it has a dark, almost scary atmosphere about it which is common today.

Emma is a boy falls in love with girl-next-door theme. She just skates from one social disaster of her own making to another, but all with the best intentions. She's just a little busybody, but a likable one.

The greatest thing just happened. I was trying to remember the details of Mansfield Park and realized that I'm just going to have to watch it again. Great excuse! I always want to watch them over and over, but time doesn't allow that. Now I have a reason. I've pulled it out to watch it again.",1268784000,,1517,4.534798534798535

I felt that this BBC collection would be an excellent companion to expand on those film versions and chance for me to see a production of Northhanger Abbey for the first time. Although for the most part well acted, and with some actors who have appeared in some of the movie versions I previously mentioned, the productions are limited to such a degree that they have the appearance of an american afternoon soap opera. Even the stories themselves, that seem so classic in a well made and directed film, come across more like soap opera dribble.  By making the comparison between these productions and the film versions previously mentioned, I did see and learn, from a viewers perspective, how important proper editing of these stories became.  For that lesson I did appreciate making the purchase.
My suggestion for anyone considering buying this collection is that you MUST BE deeply appreciative of the Jane Austen stories not to be let down by the limited production.",1265500800,4,1261,4.966824644549763

Although this version is probably truer to the novel I was very disappointed with Doran Godwin's protrayal.  I know it was filmed in 1972 but Ms. Godwin does not come close to looking as though she is 21 years of age more like 35.  Mr. Knightley was not at all appealing in this version.  The acting was just that acting, it did not feel natural at all...too theatrical.  I was looking forward to watching the entire collection and now am hestitant because if the version of Emma which is my favorite is so dull and such a disappointment, I am suspecting the others to be the same...sorry but this is just my opinion, I am glad that others found it so enjoyable so that they were not disappointed as I.",1265241600,,1111,4.547738693467337

My husband asked me about it before he ordered but I did not realize there were so many versions of these movies out there.  I was completely disappointed when I got these.  The first one I watched was defective.  It said it was continued on the other side but there was nothing on the other side, so that was a waste.  The second one was ok, but a grade B movie.

2061620,3,B000244FFU,"As you can tell from the other reviews this set is a mixed bag. I am going to discuss Emma, as I have just finished seeing it. Jane Austen thought that people would not care for her chief character, Emma, although she liked her. In this video you'll probably find that you don't like her. I did not. First let me say that with the exception of Emma, the casting is excellent. Harriet is perfect, Mr. Elton, Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston,all wonderful. Emma was not well cast, and as she is the chief character this is a drawback. The difficulty is that there are two sides to Emma. On the one hand she is a spoiled young woman who acts almost to spite Mr. Knightly (also well cast), and on the other during the story she matures, learns the errors she has been making and the consequences for herself and others of her blunders. She becomes less of a smirking school girl and more of a sensible woman. This transition does not really occur in this movie. The story calls for it, the plot moves of as if it happened, but the actress can't carry it off. She has the smirking, self-satisfied, attention grabbing Emma down to a T, but lacks the ability to present to us the chastened, more realistic and sober Emma that comes to be. On the other hand, what Emma are you going to watch:? This is a long production, and I will watch it again, which is more than I can say for some of the set.

Northanger Abbey came off fairly well, but it may be too shortened at the expense of some of the story. More later.",1259798400,,1497,4.27112676056338

2061622,5,B000244FFU,"This BBC boxset has extremely fine productions of all five titles. I happen to prefer them over all other versions. They are longer, truer to how Jane Austen wrote them, and I'm delighted to say they do not have modern themes tacked on just to make them (Yech!) relevant to today.

The 1995 P&P film, (with Jennifer Ehle & Colin Firth) deserves special mention because it is so very well liked by most everyone, even the professional movie critics!

ITV has produced later television versions which if nothing else at least have higher production values. Three of these are available in an ITV boxset (Emma, Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey). A forth from ITV (Persuasion) was released separately. All of these are very good, but I think not quite up to those in this BBC set. Yet a fifth (Pride and Prejudice) was a still later ITV television release. However the title is _Lost In Austen_ and (unlike the other four) it is greatly altered by being reset into modern times! The Hattie Morahan Sense and Sensitivity (latest BBC) might then make for a complete set for those requiring modern interpretations of Austen's classics. Note: The ITV Emma was produced earlier than their others (1997). And there was a recent Romola Garai version in 2009 (BBC).

But this set is the easy way to get all the titles and many consider them the best! And I would recommend the Republic of Pemberley forum for all things Jane Austen.

This version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is my favorite; yes, I like it even more than the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Elizabeth Garvie (Elizabeth Bennet) and David Rintoul (Mr. Darcy) epitomize the beloved characters from the print version of P&P. And... the rest of the casting is also much better. Mrs. Bennet may still be flighty, but is less cartoonish. And Lydia is still silly, but much more feminine, not so coarse. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, Miss Darcy, Mr. Bingley and his sisters, are all wonderfully portrayed.

Irene Richard, who plays Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte, in P&P, also appears in ""Sense and Sensibility"" as Elinor, with Tracey Childs as Marianne. They seem much more believable as the sisters, as well as more appropriate ages for the characters they play. Their relationship, which is really the key relationship in S&S, comes more to the foreground in this version, while their relationships with their respective lovers are less prominent, in keeping with Austen's work.

Emma, portrayed by Doran Godwin, is a more substantial Emma, a stronger character than we are accustomed to seeing her. For all her faults, she does have, as Mrs. Weston says a very good character, and that comes through more clearly in this version... every time Emma has to do something unpleasant... give Harriet more bad news, apologize to Miss Bates. Surprisingly, Mrs. Elton, though she still seems lacking in comprehension, is a bit more sympathethic. One gets the sense that her heart is in the right place, but it simply doesn't see things very clearly.

Mansfield Park may well be my favorite in this collection. Other versions I have seen in the theater and on television could not hold a candle to this one. I must attribute the quality to both the cast and the director, as well as a script that stays true to Austen's intentions (where others did not). Sylvestra Le Touzel plays Fanny, and she is an inspired choice. The rest of the cast is excellent, and I especially enjoyed the performances of Robert Burbage as Henry Crawford, and Jackie Smith-Wood as his sister, Mary Crawford. They walk the line between comedy and tragedy, as they spark the series of events that bring about the downfall of Maria and Julia, as well as their own dashed hopes for marriages that would elevate their own souls. Truly a must-see.

There were two works in the collectin that I had not yet seen, ""Persuasion,"" and ""Northanger Abbey."" I tried to watch ""Persuasion,"" but could not. That particular version was pretty awful. The theatrical version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind still stands as the definitive version in my mind, despite some omissions.

In the translation from Jane Austen novels to movies, many attempts have been made but most fall short and leave one feeling unsatisfied. The BBC obviously took great care and spent the money and time to do justice to the stories. I greatly enjoyed this series. Miss Austen's novels were written in a time of social upheaval, domestic strive, world war, foreign intrigues, and political turmoil as the feudal system breathed its last. The highly educated and well informed Miss Austen seldom alluded to these disruptive elements and chose for her subject, the soft feminine world of choreographed mating rituals of the drawing rooms. She had no need to place her novels in a historical context or explain the social rules to her readers. I am pleased that these BBC movies stayed true to the Austen stories and her sensibilities.

This Mansfield Park is the best I've seen. The BBC versions of Sense and Sensibility, Emma and Persuasion are in the top two or three. While I don't think the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle Pride and Prejudice can be equaled, the BBC version is close on its heels. This Northanger Abbey is a bit campy for my tastes, but it's fun and I am not going to say anything negative about it. Overall, these movies succeed because the directors don't try to rewrite Austen or include subject matter not in the originals.

I feel I got real value for my money and have no doubts that any Austen fan will feel the same.

The quality of the productions is excellent and, we feel, generally faithful to the novels. Watching with a small group makes it more fun and we have some spirited and thought-provoking talks about the heorines, the period, the mores of the times, etc. We are all very glad that I purchased this set.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I prefer another version of Sense & Sensibility : Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition) (1995) Starring: Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet Director: Ang Lee. I purchased it in conjunction with the set being reviewed & have found both versions still fun to watch.

The DVD was like a fast forward and eliminated the development of the characters. The one character, Isabella, was important, but she was portrayed as very cheesy and very briefly. She was the reason I bought the DVD. Not all of Jane Austen's maddening characters get their just due, but I was well satisfied with Isabella's.
The actors were mediocre but even though the DVD left out huge chunks and chopped the rest, what was left to view was like the novel. Until someone can make a decent video based on the book, I recommend reading the novel.

2061695,4,B000244FFU,"I have enjoyed watching this set I received as a gift.  The films seem to follow the books fairly closely with one glaring exception, the elimination of the character of Margaret Dashwood from Sense and Sensibility.  Something else about Sense and Sensibility bothered me, but I can't quite put a finger on it.  I just wasn't able to feel attached to the characters at all and didn't particularly care what was happening to them. I only ended up watching the first two episodes.

The other film I didn't like was Persuasion because the technical sound was horrible.  They seem to have misplaced the microphones when filming.  Some of the characters were overly loud, almost shouting, while others, seeming barely to murmur, I could barely hear.  The sound issue really spoiled the film for me, and I ended up only watching half of it because I didn't want to listen to overly loud voices just to catch what the soft spoken characters were saying.  What a way to get a headache.

I thought the rest of the films were well done.  I especially loved the interpretation of Northanger Abby.  I did get attached to those characters.  I thought Mansfield Park was well done as well.  While I like the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice best of all that have been made, I did like this version, especially the artwork preceding each episode which depicted the upcoming events.

I was very excited to receive this BBC collection as a gift.  What a disappointment!  Every film in this collection is the worst version of its respective novel that I have seen.  Perhaps I could have appreciated the greater faithfulness to the novels mentioned by many reviewers here if the films were not variously marked by either wooden acting or wild overacting, tragic miscasting and poor production values.  All these failings were terrible distractions and, for me, contributed to an almost total lack of emotional resonance. Faithfulness to the texts is of limited value if a film cannot draw you into the lives of the characters and the society they live in.

I gave the set to a local charity thrift store and so I am relieved to see that many here did enjoy the films. I hope whoever bought mine will enjoy them too.

2061725,4,B000244FFU,"I was fairly pleased with this collection of Jane Austen's works. However, I believe the Charles Dickens' collection: Volume 1 was better produced. While I enjoyed Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma, I thought Mansfield Park, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion were weak, boring, or too compressed, - leaving out much of the action.

I was able to purchase this collection for $35.00. However, at some stores (including many Borders bookstores) the collection would cost more than $35.00. I would not recommend purchasing the collection for any amount of money more than $35.00. This way, when two or three of the films fall short of your expectations, you still have three or four films that made the purchase worth your money.

If you are considering purchasing this set simply for Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion, I would advise purchasing them individually and buying the newer BBC version of Persuasion along with the Masterpiece Theatre version of Northanger Abbey.

The BBC production, which is not the same as the one recently broadcast by Masterpiece Theater, was a mere $36.47.  We have started with the two lesser known stories of Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park.  Northanger Abbey is a strange story of a teenage girl who is lost in her imagination of Gothic horror novels. Watching the video was like watching Alfred Hitchcock direct Jane Austin. Mansfield Park was a BBC series that lasted 6 episodes of 1 hour. The pacing is incredibly slow. My wife is bored to death. We are watching it to find out how it ends and to get our money's worth. We know the stories of the more famous books: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma.  We don't know Persuasion, and will watch that next.

I have to applaud the creators for not picking out handsome and gorgeous movie actors for this set, but real honest to god looking people.  It does take a while to get past how normal and often plain the actors look in this series, but after viewing a few I liked it.

I agree with another reviewer that one should not expect these to be anything like the A&E version/adaptations.  I enjoyed Emma and Mansfield Park, but Northanger Abbey was so bad I couldn't get thru it.

2061758,3,B000244FFU,"I think most Jane Austen fans will be disappointed in this set.  These are from the older BBC TV series ranging from 1972 to 1987. They all are presented in a stageplay format with low production values.

Positives:  All except Northanger Abbey are longer versions and contain more of the dialog from Jane Austens books (with the exception of Sense and Sensiblity, which ends rather abruptly and doesn't go into the romance of Marianne and the Captain).

Negatives: All of the newer versions have better production values, better acting, and better screen plays.

My recommendations are: If you want entertainment and good production quaility, buy the Hollywood versions and the Collin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice(1995), they are better.  Even the 2007 versions that are being presented on Masterpiece Theater 2008 are better than this set.  If you want an adaptation that is closer to the book, 4 of these adaptations are much closer and it is cheaper to buy them as a set. If you are a die hard Austen fan (like me)and have to own everything available buy the set.",1196380800,8,1075,4.841530054644808

2061761,4,B000244FFU,"This is an interesting collection of some of the earlier BBC Austen videos. I have always preferred these to the later versions, largely because they are truer (although most are not very true) to Austen's books.

I am at a loss to know why film and television makers should think that Austen has to be abridged and modernised to suit a modern audience - I would have thought that  most of Austen's readers both love and understand her language, wit and humour, in the context of her times. On several occasions, some of the emendations and omissions cause the meaning of the original to be lost.

Still, these are the best you can get, in my opinion.

That is, with one exception. I am not sure whether other versions of Northanger Abbey exist, but this one is awful. The twisting of the plot to make something more ""interesting"", coupled with the ghastly music, make for a poor experience - 2 stars.

As for the rest:

Pride and Prejudice - Elizabeth Garvie is the quintessential Elizabeth Bennet - none better to date. Some of Fay Weldon's adaptation is not very good, but overall I like this one a lot. Very true to Austen, although rather patchy as a work of art. Darcy is OK, Wickham and Colonel Fitzwilliam weak, Lady Catherine very disappointing. Mr Collins very good, although many of his subtleties lost. The Bennets over all good, although they needed a much more beautiful woman for Jane. I don't like any of the other versions - 4 stars.

Mansfield Park - I personally really like MP, although many don't. This series is really very good, and the performances for the characters Fanny, Edmund, Crawford, and *particularly* Mary Crawford are all excellent. Sir Thomas dull, Lady Bertram odd, Mrs Norris excellent to start but weakened as it went on. This was very true and the cutting/emendation satisfactory - 4.5 stars.

Sense and Sensibility - this is the best of a fairly poor bunch, in that it is fairly true to the book. I thoroughly disliked the Emma Thompson version. Elinor was well played, if a little stiffly. Marianne was well played. Mrs Dashwood stiff and dull, Colonel Brandon not bad, Sir John overplayed, the actor playing Willoughby did not fit the part or my imagination. I thought that Edward was well played, and Lucy very well played. Mrs Jennings not quite there - 3.5 stars.

Emma - again, this is the best of the crowd. I loathed the Paltrow version, and vaguely recall another (Clueless) which was a rework rather than an adaptation, and pretty boring. Both Emma and Miss Smith very well played. Miss Bates not annoying enough! Mr Woodhouse was well played, except he was too athletic when walking around. Too many introduced lines for him - must have been a demand of the actor. Mr Knightley was reasonable, and at his best in the ultimate scene, which I though well done. Frank Churchill was very well played, Jane quite good, but too ""piano"", as Admiral Croft would say. Other supporting parts reasonable - 4 stars

Persuasion - this is my favourite Austen novel, and, despite a large number of script gaffes and very poor direction/production (lord, why didn't they fix them - must have been VERY low budget), this captures the feel of the book well. Some poor changes, and glaring omissions, especially some of Anne's speeches. I though Anne was well played, and Captain Wentworth well played in a rather Shakespearean mode. Sir Walter well played but patchy, William not bad, Elizabeth wrong - she was given too many lines supporting other speakers. Crofts were poor, Mrs Clay and father OK. Mary was very well played (probably the pick here), as was Charles Musgrove. Other Musgroves ordinary - Mrs was wrong. Musgrove girls well played. The chief problem with this is that its production is terrible, and it looks very dated. Otherwise I enjoy this one - 4 stars for the actors, 1 star for the direction and production - call it 3.5 stars overall

If you prefer the early adaptations to the late, this is worth owning.",1195430400,11,3964,4.722141823444284

2061764,2,B000244FFU,"I own many versions of these Jane Austen classics and love them. This set was, however, almost too painful to watch! The acting was so over the top that it was not at all believable. Nothing but dogged determination made me watch to the conclusion of Pride and Prejudice. I waited the entire time to detect some emotion on the frozen face of Mr. Darcy to finally see it in the last few minutes crack into what was, I suppose, meant to be a smile. The 'heroine' in Northanger Abbey was a cup and saucer short of a full place setting. Emma was so-so. The best three were Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, in that order.

2061773,5,B000244FFU,"This BBC boxed set has all of Jane Austen's works in one collection. As always the BBC adaptations are one of the most faithful to the novels upon which they are based. The version of Pride & Prejudice was my favorite of the collection. The actress who portrays Ms Eliza Bennett plays her role with wit, charm, and a vulnerability that is juxtaposed against the actor who plays the proud, arrogant Mr Darcy. Persuasion is also well-made, and the story of love lost and found is told poignantly with good performances by the two leads. The version of Emma here is the most faithful I have comes across of other adaptations, but I did not like the lead actress' portrayal of Emma, she seemed too stuffy, and even cold [compared to Kate Beckinsale's and Gwyneth Paltrow's performances in other versions].  This version of Sense and Sensibility was also very true to the novel, but both the main leads appeared plain and washed out [I much preferred Emma Thompson's and Kate Winslet's performances in a different version]. Finally, the version of Northanger Abbey here was truly a departure from the other DVDs in this collection, and that is quite understandable given that Jane Austen did write it in the style of a Gothic romance [whilst still poking fun at the English upper class].

All in all, its a worthwhile collection for any Austen fan, and its good to watch them and compare the scenes to the ones in the books.",1175644800,37,1419,4.694779116465863

2061775,5,B000244FFU,"I mainly bought the collection to replace my video-tapes of P&P and Mansfield Pk. But I am happy to have them all. As for criticism that the stories feel like plays instead of film, I agree with that criticism for Persuasion and at times for Sense and Sensibility. Persuasion was almost unwatchable because of the stiff, awkward acting and artificially high voices and forced accents. I often felt that Anne was afraid to tip her head for fear her  wig would fall off!

But I kept the release dates in mind, and the newer movies were greatly improved. Besides, I appreciate being able to buy the whole collection for what I originally paid just for Pride and Prejudice on video tape!

I have always particularly loved P&P, and even the A&E version hasn't shaken that. I love them both equally well. They are just different in their style and purpose.

Pride and Predjudice: As mentioned, I like this version as much as the A&E version, but in different ways. My family has often remarked that we wish we could take characters from both versions and put them into one. We like the BB version Mr. Collins and Miss Bingly MUCH better, as well as Lydia and the mother. The Darcys, Mr. Binglys, Charlottes and Lady Catherines we like equally well in both versions. I did not care for the silly playfulness they kept having the A&E Lizzy doing, and Miss Bingly was not at all elegant (especially how she kept swinging her arms almost like a man), but I otherwise thought the A&E version was also well done. I liked the A&E scene of Darcy tracking down Mr. Wickam, but do agree with a previous review that it should not have been shown BEFORE it was all resolved, thereby giving away the surprise of it for Lizzy. It would have been much better to show it as Lizzy read Mrs. Gardner's explanation.

Mansfield Park: It's true that Fanny and Edward are both unbearably plain, almost ugly, and the story moves slowly. But it's still a good story that we enjoy re-watching occasionally. I just wish Jane Austin had allowed them to put on at least a dress rehersal of the play before the father came home.

Sense and Sensibility: My only two complaints with this version are Maryanne's fake-sounding English--a constant reminder that she was acting, not living the part--and Eleanor's inability to portray her own deep emotion realistically. Irene Richard was otherwise very suited to the part. Except for those two flaws, I thought the movie otherwise very good.

Emma: I enjoyed it more the second time I watched it. Emma's face and acting are a bit too much like a well-cinched corset, but she does tolerably well. This version does feel very much like a play at times, but what is wroing with watching a play? On the whole I enjoyed it.

Northanger Abbey: Enjoyable, and I like the heroine, but it leaves out so much from the book that makes the characters and plot far more believable.",1173744000,23,2878,4.629411764705883

My major gripe with the set is poor acting and casting.  Normally I don't think too much about the quality of acting or casting in a miniseries (or even movies) but in most of the DVDs here it was just too poor to ignore.  This is especially so with the actress who played Fanny Price in Mansfield Park.  It was an awful casting choice, same for the actress who played Anne Elliot in Persuasion.  Most series felt as if you were watching a play that had been recorded.  Some sets and costumes looked VERY dated. Sometimes it was hard to watch, only Emma did I find reasonably well done.  This Pride and Prejudice doesn't hold a candle to the production of 1995.

Persuasion has excellent acting, but the costumes and hairstyles are decidedly 60s dated (who ever wore bright green checkers in Austen's time?)

Unfortunately Sense and Sensibility is horrible- they took wide liberties with the script (it's barely recognizable in my opinion) and the characters are not very accurate.

2061804,1,B000244FFU,"I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan and I was ecstatic when I discovered this collection. My complaint...and it is a huge one...is that these films (All of them) are poor. I expected better from BBC. I don't mean the acting or the costumes but the actual filming. I couldn't get past it. It looked like someone recorded a high school play ""gorilla style."" There was bad lighting...you could hear the echo of the actors' footsteps on the stage which took away from the film. I don't know, but I couldn't help but think I got a bum deal. I love Jane Austen because when I read her books or watch them in film version, I always get swept away in the magic of it all. With these films, that didn't happen. If you want a quality version of Pride and Prejudice that sticks to the book, just buy the A&E version with Colin Firth. It's on sale for about twenty bucks and is PERFECT in every way! For the other movies...just read the books. Your imagination could probably come up with a better vision of what these movies should be like. If you're like me and just collect Jane Austen movies...then by all means, get this collection but remember it is NOT top notch.",1140998400,30,1150,4.3534883720930235

Yes, I was aware they were made for TV which is not the same as a real movie but these Austen BBC versions are almost ""theatrical"". I do not enjoy that.

2061809,3,B000244FFU,"I enjoy good movies based on classic novels.  But when making a movie, make a MOVIE.  The problem with these adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, is that they attempt to film the books.  If that's what you like - and apparently judging by the reviews of some others - these films could be just what you are looking for.  But I would just as soon read the books.

  If I want to watch a movie, I much prefer the Emma Thompson Sense and Sensibility, or the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma, to the films included in this package.  The new Pride and Prejudice with Kierra Knightly is hardly Jane Austen; it was more like Emily Bronte.  In fact, it was the best Wuthering Heights I ever saw.  Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable movie.

  I suggest seeing the more recent films, though I though the new Persuasion was dull, and the new Mansfield Park ridiculous.  Actually, the ones in this package are better than those.",1133308800,8,912,4.4817073170731705

2061811,5,B000244FFU,"In my opinion, these productions are the best visual versions of Jane Austen's novels -- by which I mean they are closest to the content of the novels themselves. This is due partly to their being four to five hours long, and therefore able to include almost all the characters and plot of the novels. But more importantly, these versions resisted the temptation to change the characters and plot to inject modern points of view -- a temptation that few of the recent spate of movie versions have been able to resist. In particular, these productions preserve Jane Austen's delicate sense of irony, which is such a large part of what makes the novels enjoyable. Everything in the productions contributes to their success: the superb acting, the costuming, and the locations. Translating a novel into a visual production can never be done perfectly, but these versions I believe come as close as is possible to providing a cinematographic experience similar to the literary experience of reading the novels.",1128038400,38,1006,4.994047619047619

2061814,4,B000244FFU,If you have read the Jane Austen books and really enjoy them then this seriers of DVDs can be enjoyable.

2061817,3,B000244FFU,"I am a Jane Austen fan, having read all the novels several times and was thrilled to buy the complete set of DVDs.  My favorite book is Pride and Prejudice so I watched this video first and was most disappointed in it out of all six (although it is by no means the worst).  Probably because I went in with the highest expectations.  The acting was good, although Mr. Darcy was a bit stiff.  The biggest letdown is that it ends so abruptly immediately after the long-awaited understanding is reached between Elizabeth and Darcy...just when I want even more detail even from the book (dare I criticize my favorite book), the movie fails to provide even that much depth.  This movie I give only 2/5 stars  You are much better served to purchase the famous A&E (Colin Firth) version.

Emma, I watched next and with lower expectations.  I was much fonder of this DVD.  The Mr. Knightley comes across more angry and condescending to Emma than I would prefer, but overall I give this one a 4/5 stars.

Sense and Sensibility is fairly true to the novel with the exception of the omision  of the youngest Dashwood sister, Margaret.  I really liked the Colonel Brandon character/actor.  I didn't personally find the Willoughby character all that attractive, making him easier to dislike.  My DVD skips in the pivotal scene of Marianne's first encounter with Willoughby in London and this was very disappointing... I don't know if Amazon will replace this yet or not.  All in all, this one I give a 3.5/5 stars.

Persuasion is my favorite movie from this set.  The acting was good, the ending very sweet.  Frederick was not how I pictured him in my mind but one can hardly blame BBC for that.  I give this one a 4.5/5

Mansfield Park stays fairly true to the novel except Fanny seems so stern and prudish that it did not seem plausible for Henry to fall in love with her.  The ending was also not very romantic making Edmund seem to choose Fanny almost only because he was so let down by Mary...I need romance if I'm going to root for cousins getting married!  This one is a 2/5 stars.

Lastly, Northanger Abbey. This one is only 90 minutes and that is plenty for it is horrible!  I didn't really like any of the characters even Catherine.  Very disappointing.  This one I give 1/5 stars.",1122940800,222,2277,4.54679802955665
2061818,2,B000244FFU,"I bought these movies because I'm an avid Jane Austen reader, and the majority of the reviews were so positive. So I made the investment - big mistake.

I've only watched Pride and Prejudice and Emma so far, and I don't mind the cinematogrophy; I got used to it after a while. But the acting and scripts are just awful!  The writers gave a great deal of Elizabeth Bennett's lines to other characters (which distorts the portrayal of the characters) and made up a good deal of the goofy dialog (which is probably only disappointing to those of us who have read the books several times).

The movies were poorly cast - all Bennett girls looked to be nearing forty, Mr. Bennet goes around grumpy and growling all the time (not at all the way he's portrayed in the books), and Mr. Darcy has virtually no personality at all.  The lady playing Emma was horrible - she had the same facial expression throughout the entire movie and is just scary-looking.

Bottom line: if you like Jane Austen's novels, or entertaining movies for that matter, watch the other versions of these movies.",1122768000,20,1077,4.617801047120419

2061822,5,B000244FFU,"These adaptions of Jane Austen's novels are so great. As most people have said, the cinematography leaves a lot to be desired but it was in the 70s and 80s and in England. Maybe things weren't so advanced then. The acting is above par. I haven't watched ""Persuasion"" or ""Sense and Sensibility"" yet but I plan to.

I will review the movies I have watched so far:

""Emma"": My favorite one of the movies so far. The actress who plays Emma - Doran Godwin - is simply charming! And Mr. Knightley's portrayor, although not the least bit handsome, is the perfect actor for the role. Its very clever and is very much like the book. There is no kiss between Emma and her beau which disappointed me but it is satisfying none of the less.

""Mansfield Park"" comes in a close second (I disagree with Fanny being called boring by the Amazon reviewers. She is a great character; just repressed. She is more polished and lady-like than most of the rich women in the movie.) I fell in love with Edmund and the actor who played him. He is a wonderful, wonderful character. Like ""Emma"" there was no kiss in this one, either. Boo hiss!

""Northanger Abbey"": The most spirited of the movies. My god was the actress who played Catherine fabulous and my favorite actress in the whole BBC Collection (along with Miss Godwin). I couldn't take my eyes of her and her love interest, Henry Tilney is played wonderfully by Peter Firth (I wonder if he is related to Mr. Colinm Firth???)There was a kiss at the end and it was a great one!

""Pride and Prejudice"": I had only gotten half way through this when my friend asked to borrow it and I lent it to her without finishing it (although I intend to). It is a nice adapation but the acting of the lead actor (David-Something) is much lacking in accomplishment. Darcy is supposed to be rigid and cold but he brings a new meaning to the words ""stiff as a board"". He looks like I imagined Mr. Darcy to look but I guess it is impossible to top Colin Firth. I thought the role of Elizabeth was well cast. And Mrs. Bennett is well-portrayed. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Mr. Collins. Hilarious. And the actress who plays Charlotte is delightful too.

Overall, so far, this is an amazing collection and I highly recommend it.",1108166400,32,2240,4.451219512195122

However, if you already enjoy them, then you're going to have a nice surprise when you get the DVDs.  The DVDs contain scenes not found on the videotapes.  We saw that for ourselves when we put on Pride and Prejudice which is one of our favorites.  In this case, there's 265 minutes in the DVD version, but only 229 in the videotape version.  That's a big difference!  Not only do you get more to enjoy, but the DVDs are going to last a lot longer than the videotapes.  The picture and sound are fine.

2061828,3,B000244FFU,"I enjoyed all of these movies, but they are all a bit more like watching a play than seeing a movie and could have done with quite a bit of editing to make them move along more quickly.
Emma is the best of this collection, just as good as the other two versions out there (one with Gwyeneth Paltrow and the other with Kate Beckensdale).  I really like all of them.  This Emma plays the part beautifully.
The Mansfield Park in this set is nice because it sticks so closely to the book and is less risque than the new version.
Northhanger Abbey will have to do until someone remakes it, enjoyable, but could be so much better.
You should know by now that there is a far superior version of Pride & Prejudice out there.  This one actually does a few things better, but just drags on and on.
Persuation is very well done here, but the lead character cast is too old for the part even though she does a great job, it is distracting to have a woman who appears 10 years older than the character she is supposed to be playing.  The other version of Persuasion (though the heroine is also a bit too old) is superior.
