8234183,1,B000YVB81K,There was something wrong with my Sabbath dvd when I stuck it in my dvd player. IT STINKS. The only thing worse than the zombi makeup is the the zombi like acting. Wait a minute. I just figured it out. This is a comedy. Where is the Oscar committee? This was funnier than Stripes.,1240012800,,280,4.203703703703703
8234184,2,B000YVB81K,"I saw the bad reviews,and i felt people we're alittle harsh on the movie,So i went on ahead and bought the movie,but no thier right,its pretty bad,acting everything,nobody seem to want to talk in the movie,well then i saw why,nobody can act,but i realize one didn't have a problem acting thats my dawg David Crawford from Dawn of the Dead,but even he couldn't save this movie,I thought the little creepy guys dress all in black we're kool,but other then that it was bad..

I bought lots of low budget movies,like deadlife,of the living dead,meat market zombie bloodbath
this 1 was the worst of all hands down
deadlife,bloodbath and meat market had the same problem,bad actors,pretty good action and gore and stuff but the acting destroyed these films
Of the living dead had good actors,but didn't have a very good film crew @ all,maybe if this movie could take those guys and put in the Sabbath,probably would of been alot better
William man come on get your actors into the movie,they look like they don't care,get them emotionally into the movie!

if you looking for a kool low-budget zombie movie,i would recommended Meat Market 1,2,or 3 its alot better then this
alot more women :)",1208908800,,1185,4.803921568627451
8234185,1,B000YVB81K,"WOW What can I say...?

1) ACTING: Usually, when it comes to low budget / no budget indies, I try to be lenient, but MAN! The quality of acting here was pretty low. The male lead seems to mumble through all his lines unless he's screaming or yelling at someone. The 2 baseball players are just terrible. I would have to say the best actor here was the actress that played the character of Geller, but that's really not saying a lot.

2) PRODUCTION: Here, I believe is the best part of the movie. I felt that the filming was good, scenes were well lit, and characters and action scenes were well focused. The music / soundtrack was effective in conveying a creepy, unnerving 'Silent Hill' type of background. That's about all I have that's good to say. The Grim Reaper was just another actor in a hooded robe with a scythe, the zombie make up was minimal at best, and a lot of the CG is iffy at best. The plot isn't necessarily bad, it's just that it never seemed to be fleshed out, and the viewer is left with many questions that go unanswered, such as 'Why is this happening?""

3) ZOMBIES: The zombies in this one pretty much the Romero Shamblers that we've all grown to love, but occassionally, a Snyder Runner would pop in. The zombie make up ( as mentioned above) was pretty minimal and consisted of white / grey faces with raccoon eyes and little to none facial applications.

4) THE CAUSE: No explanation is given, other than it is ""the end of days.""

5) NUDITY: None. (Not that it would've helped)

FINAL:
YOWSA! This was a pretty rough watch. I think this is one of the rare times where I have actually enjoyed the quality of the filming than anything else in a movie. For something to be so bad, but to look so nice was bizarre. The Director, William Victor Schotten, has done better things previously, and I was surprised to find this movie so disappointing. It's like he just stopped by for the paycheck. Sadly, I can not reccomend this one at all. Give 'Sabbath' a pass.

RATING:
1 out of 5",1206230400,5,2002,4.380053908355795
