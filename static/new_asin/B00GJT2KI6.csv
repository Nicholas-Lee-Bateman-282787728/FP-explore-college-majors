6080807,5,B00GJT2KI6,"Going by the historical reports that can be found, it would seem that MGM based its decision to drop either Deanna Durbin or Judy Garland on the screening of a 1936 Exhibitor's Reel featuring the two young girls which was produced before EVERY SUNDAY.

The Exhibitor's Reel has been lost in history, but Judy Garland may of made mention to it when she stated one time, ""I had a dirty face and an apple in my mouth, and she was the 'Princess of Transylvania' or some such crazy thing.""

The story goes that while Louis B. Mayer was away on a trip he instructed his people at MGM to ""drop the fat one."" They misunderstood and mistakenly let Deanna go.

When Mayer found out that Judy Garland was still at the studio and that Deanna was gone  he was very upset. That's just one of the reasons Mayer was never overly fond of Judy. He also preferred Deanna's classical singing over Judy's jazzy repertoire.

Soon after Deanna was released by MGM, Universal Studios gave her a contract on the 13th of June and cast her in the September production of THREE SMART GIRLS which became a major smash hit. An executive from MGM was overheard speaking about the two girls saying: ""Universal got Tiffany's and we're stuck with Woolworth's.""

To this day, Deanna Durbin is the only actress in motion picture history to have ten hits in a row. The first ten were both artistic and financial successes. All of that money rolling into Universal certainly bothered Louis B. Mayer.

Judy eventually became a star for MGM and brought in a lot of revenue. The biggest problem was that Louis B. Mayer treated his stars like family and Judy was always causing trouble.

Even Mickey Rooney was not a problem. Mickey was there, he knew what to do, and a lot of times covered-up for Judy. She cost MGM a lot of money with production costs going way overboard. That more than anything is what put Mayer against her.",1389657600,8,1887,4.545722713864307

8623912,5,B00GJT2KI6,"This is kind of a history of early to mid 1900's. Some of the 'shorts' are VERY good - like the one with Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin (Every Sunday). It was quite intereting to see Judy at the very start of her explosive career. But it was even more interesting to Deanna Durbin right before her big hit - 3 Smart Girls. For those who don't know for several years Deanna was a bigger star than Judy and then just 'walked away' from her career refusing to say exactly why for the rest of her life.

And then there were ones like the one with a very young Jack Benny, in The Rounder from 1930. It was only the third 'film' Benny appeared in. It wasn't really good as I felt the Benny was kind of stumbling around but it was still interesting to see him at the very start of his career.

But my favorite was 'It's in the Stars' from 1938. It involves some fraternity and sorority kids trying to decide between growing up and being young in love. For anyone who's attended college it's a must see - It's a real hoot!

I would rate this at least a 8.50 to 9.50 just for the historical value alone! VERY HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO AT LEAST WATCH ONCE!",1416873600,6,1141,4.177272727272728
8623913,5,B00GJT2KI6,"Disc One

Copy (1929) - Roscoe Karns, an actor usually thought of as a comedian, has an effective dramatic turn here as a sensation-seeking newspaper editor who has an epiphany when the hot story he's covering takes on a personal turn.

The Rounder (1930) - Jack Benny stars in this non-musical comedy as a drunken, sniveling young playboy who arranges a quickie marriage with Ethel (Dorothy Sebastian), a vengeful heiress abruptly jilted by her fiancee.

Gentlemen of Polish (1934) - Shaw & Lee, a slapstick comedy duo in the Laurel & Hardy mold, have their day in this short. Escaping the cops, they crash a fancy party where lavish musical numbers (taken from other films?) transpire.

Gypsy Night (1935) - This ""Colortone Musical"" follows two gypsy children who steal toys from the camp puppeteer's wagon, then have a horrific nightmare. Bizarre and wonderful.

Memories and Melodies (1935) - A fictionalized account of the twilight years in American songwriter Stephen Foster's life, shot in beautiful Technicolor with some enjoyably non-p.c. numbers.

Two Hearts in Wax Time (1935) - Another weird-ass Technicolor curiosity with a drunken department store custodian hallucinating that the store's mannequin-filled display windows have come to life. Includes a memorable bit with Captain Kidd, Fu Manchu, Bluebeard and Frankenstein's Monster.

Violets in Spring (1936) - Made with stylized camera angles and unusually daring montages, this zippy boy-meets-girl-in-the-city musical short served as a fine vehicle for up-and-coming actors Virginia Grey and George Murphy.

New Shoes (1936) - This ""Tabloid Musical"" has a winsome Arthur Lake (Dagwood from the Blondie films and TV show) as a young man at a shoe store who woos another customer in song - with the footwear joining in!

Swing Banditry (1936) - Georgie Stoll and His Orchestra maneuver themselves into the same elevator with a radio station manager they were desperate to audition for. Lots of lively numbers (including ""Sing Sing Sing"" with lyrics); eternally flustered comic actor Franklin Pangborn has a bit as a radio station employee.

No Place like Rome (1936) - This bit of ancient history musical comedy fluff predates A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum by a few decades. Frank Albertson plays a happy Roman bachelor who falls for a lovely slave girl, in a silly tale that uses stock footage from MGM's silent Ben Hur.

Annie Laurie (1936) - MGM starlet Ann Rutherford teams up with Dennis Morgan (billed as Stanley Morner) in this romantic fantasy of two young lovers caught in the middle of Scotland's battle for the throne in the 18th century.

Every Sunday (1936) - Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin's audition reel - contemplate whether Louis B. Mayer really said ""dump the fat one"" (Garland) after seeing this.

A Girl's Best Years (1936) - Musical with baritone John Warburton as a wealthy songwriter who hires lady reporter Sheila Terry to keep his lawsuit-happy ex-girlfriends at bay. Even by MGM standards, this is one handsomely produced short.

Disc Two

Dancing on the Ceiling (1937) - Another ""Tabloid Musical"" with some wild, Streamline Moderne-styled set pieces, highlighted with a number where a lustful dental patient gets gassed and dreams up a roomful of pretty upside-down dental assistants (you guessed it) dancing on the ceiling.

Bars and Stripes (1937) - More swing and youthful exuberance as a college jazz band (headed by handsome actor Dick Winslow) attempts to correct their lack of a suitable practice space by getting themselves thrown in jail. Whatever works, fellas.

Some Time Soon (1937) - In this ""Miniature Musical Comedy,"" a factory worker keeps pining away for her Prince Charming to rescue her, unaware that her co-worker is a nobleman in disguise. MGM seems to have set up Jean Chatburn and Gregory Gaye in this as an alternate Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.

The Little Maestro (1937) - Diminutive comic Jerry Bergen does a Chaplin-esque act as a mute hobo who pretends to be a talented violinist to gain a free meal at a swanky nightclub.

Song of Revolt (1937) - Coming off a bit like MGM's Passing Parade historical shorts, this one has actor Leon Ames (Meet Me in St. Louis) as the French songwriter who composed that country's national anthem, ""Les Marseillaise."" Ames' singing voice is dubbed and the French Revolution footage is borrowed from A Tale of Two Cities.

Carnival in Paris (1937) - Ann Rutherford returns in this charming romantic fantasy, playing a poor French waif who meets a friendly museum custodian (Henry Brandon) during carnival season in Paris. The attractiveness of the two leads bolster the forgettable music and dubbed singing.

The Canary Comes Across (1938) - As a prison warden's daughter who conducts the jail's glee club, Virginia Grey seems to be the sole plus on this silly, confusing story. Strong-voiced Erik Rhodes is Grey's love interest as a singing convict with an exact duplicate.

Snow Gets in Your Eyes (1938) - Enjoyable fluff set at a department store's indoor skiing competition; the singing Dandridge Sisters add some swing. This was the last MGM short for hard-working actress Virginia Grey, before appearing in features like Idiot's Delight and The Women.

The Magician's Daughter (1938) - Prolific character actor Frank Albertson plays a journalist attempting to uncover the secrets of a local magician, only to end up falling for the man's daughter (Eleanor Lynn).

It's in the Stars (1938) - College frolics with a fraternity and sorority reluctantly passing a measure to stop dating each other so their grades improve. Finding the notion preposterous, the school's Astronomy professor schemes a way to reunite the student body.

Streamlined Swing (1938) - Buster Keaton directed this brief showcase for The Original Sing Band, a talented group of black entertainers who could mimic various jazz instruments using their voices. Lively numbers in this brisk piece.

Men of Steel (1938) - Obscure singers Kenny Stevens and Doris Western get their time to shine in this peppy tale of washing machine factory workers putting on a show which moves on to the footlights of Broadway.

Once Over Lightly (1938) - Mustachioed comic Billy Gilbert stars in this broad satire of college life, with two fiercely competitive barber schools facing off in a heated competition.

Disc Three

A Dream of Love (1939) - Aging composer Franz Liszt (Ian Colin) recalls a great romance from his past after receiving an unexpected package. This historic two reeler was directed by James A. FitzPatrick (he of the Travel Talks shorts).

Somewhat Secret (1939) - The popular motif of Swing Versus Classical gets another go-round with this perky college musical. A prim lady principal declares her school a Jitterbug-free zone, not knowing that her professor boyfriend conducts a hot Swing band on the side.

Happily Buried (1939) - Comedian Benny Rubin plays an Indian Yogi in this strange tale of strife between competing waffle iron manufacturers - with lavish musical numbers (you can't make this stuff up).

Rhumba Rhythm (1939) - Another of MGM's excuses for music, mayhem and star cameos (look, it's Lana Turner!). Sally Payne and Mary Treen play star-struck girlfriends who sneak into Hollywood's fabulous La Conga nightclub.

Love on Tap (1939) - Director George Sidney (Annie Get Your Gun) guides this densely plotted drama with dance sequences, centered around an arrogant woman (Mary Howard) who keeps postponing the wedding to her patient fiancee (Truman Bradley). This one was filmed at the now-demolished Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.

Mendelssohn's Wedding March (1939) - A candy-colored account of the creation of Felix Mendelssohn's immortal ""Wedding March,"" it's another historically suspect musical short directed by James A. FitzPatrick (color me surprised that he did other stuff besides travelogues).

Heavenly Music (1943) - The sole Academy Award-winner on this set, this lightweight musical comedy concerns a Swing bandleader (Frederick Brady), who must pass judgment from a panel of history's most famous composers before getting accepted into the Pearly Gates.

Ode to Victory (1943) - MGM's self-promoting clip show and stirring wartime propaganda rolled into one, this patriotic short tells the history of America through songs both old (""Battle Hymn of the Republic"") and new (""Ode to Victory"").

Spreadin' the Jam (1945) - This lively, Swing music-filled short puts the well-worn ""Let's put on a show"" plot to good use as a rent-deprived young woman gets help from the other tenants in her apartment to convince the landlady to let her stay.

Musical Masterpieces (1946) - A singing couple (Carlos Ramirez and Lucille Norman) perform creatively staged renditions of classical pieces in this fun, lightweight piece - one of the few directing efforts from MGM's longtime Art Director Merrill Pye.
