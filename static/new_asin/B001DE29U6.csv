8326349,5,B001DE29U6,i loved it but very upset that it was cancelled lol.  i've been looking everywhere else but don't know why I didn't check Amazon first:).  i speak Spanish so the lack of subtitles I could care less about.  I'm just happy to have it on dvd so I can watch a million times if i feel like it lol,1394323200,,291,3.8983050847457625
8326350,2,B001DE29U6,"The series itself is great y chistoso, with lots of interesting situations y actrices buenisimas.  However, if you're looking for any subtitles, either English or Spanish, you won't find them here.  Quite a disappointment to release a DVD with ZERO subtitles.  It appears that other DVD versions do have subtitles [...]. Amazon needs to correct the description which claims the product is in ""English"" when in fact there is only Spanish audio and no subtitles.",1309824000,,460,5.1066666666666665
8326351,5,B001DE29U6,"Don't be fooled by the low price of this DVD set.  I, too, wasn't sure if this was the entire first season because the price is so low compared to the price it is sold for in Mexico (~US$40, which is what a series season normally costs.)  But I did buy it and it is the entire first season.  It comes with 4 DVDs each in its own case.  I highly recommend this series.  It has been compared to ""Sex and the City.""  It is somewhat similar in that it is about the lives of 5 women but it's different because some of these women are married, one is single, one divorced, and one is a single mother.  So, it is not just a Mexican remake of ""Sex and the City.""  The stories of these women are different and, in my opinion, more realistic. I think a lot of women of any nationality/race will relate more to the everyday lives of these characters more so than the characters from ""Sex and the City.""",1226966400,5,891,4.109826589595376
