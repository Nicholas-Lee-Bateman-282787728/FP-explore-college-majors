8520026,4,B007OY6ZI6,"Marine Recon is an excellent DVD set -- but it might not be what some expect. This documentary takes us on a journey with the Marines of Alpha Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. This feature takes place about 6 months after the main fighting in Fallujah. As a result, you won't see much gun-play and the one event were these guys do go in -- the camera isn't allowed. Sorry, Classified!

Most of this documentary series is about the misery of living in Post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. It's miserable! If the reporter seems like he's whining a lot, it's for a purpose. If the audience can't actually be there on the ground then we have only his words to describe what it's like. We see Marines on patrol in full combat gear and it seems pretty cool but they're doing this 'day in' and 'day out' in 115 degree heat and still expected to perform like Recon Marines. It's Miserable!!!! Most of their duties have been redirected to the form of street cop, something they were never trained for but they have to improvise, adapt and overcome. Boredom and Complacency become their biggest enemies while still trying to be effective in a war-zone.

It's an amazing documentary but not Hollywood amazing, more like real-life amazing.",1512950400,,1243,4.75

The reporter aka journalist on this is a total punk. He continously whines about how hot it is and goat dung in the rotar wash. Whiner. People live their lives there. Too rugged for you tea drinker?

Visit Antarctica for a doc and we can listen to you continously crying about the chilly weather.

Boo hoo.",1509667200,,351,4.453125
