8658399,5,B009K8XGO0,"This documentary is about Election Day 2008, from the point of view of voters across the country and people around the world who were electrified by Barack Obama's candidacy. It is, far and away, the best way to relive or reflect on the excitement of that day. The director edits together hundreds of clips provided by people from around the world, and dramatically stitches together a story that truly crescendos into goosebumps. Highly recommended for political junkies, documentary aficionados, and -- if I may -- the President himself, who could use the booster shot of enthusiasm that is 11/4/08.",1349568000,,601,5.08080808080808

In a system most people feel deep down is not entirely fair this was the culmination of a moment where something seemed to have broken through that. Perhaps a glitch, or the rare upside of long term probability, but it felt like after years of never expecting it to merit somehow swam its way towards the top, and we were all given a chance to help it with that last push to the surface. Many people felt as though, all of a sudden, they existed.
There was a keen insight here to anticipate the feelings of this day and record them. I found the result moving.",1349049600,,677,4.255813953488372
