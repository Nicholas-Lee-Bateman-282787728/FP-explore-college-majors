To say that this documentary is sad means say nothing.
To say that it is a commemoration without feast means say nothing.

It looks like Leopold Gruen made an attempt to build story about Dean Reed based on interviews of several people from Germany, Chile and the United States. He also used different documentary episodes. Thanks to pieces of songs presented in this movie we can think that he was singer of sad and march patriotic songs. However I remember he also sang songs in styles of Rock-n-roll and Country. They are attracted young people in the end of 70-s and beginning of 80-s of 20Th century. (It was my late teenager years. I lived in Kiev, Ukraine at that time. (Ukraine was a part of Soviet Union until the end of 1991.)) For a reason the movie ""Sing, Cowboy, Sing"" was mentioned as a comedy but why that episode was presented? Vaclav Neckar, a guy from Czechoslovakia who played Benjamin dressed like a woman was a really fun in that episode. I remember in this movie Dean Reed was really fun in some other episodes. Examples are, he was hugging a snake instead of woman being sleepy or he was flying through prison cell window.

In one episode a representative East German T.V. was talking to Dean Reed on phone.
He said before, ""He was arrested by the U.S. Authorities for taking part in a protest against the monopoly of agro-business companies."" and ""We now have the opportunity to speak to Dean Reed who is expecting my call in Buffalo.""
I don't think new spectators could understand what kind of a protest was. I knew from other sources it was a protest of farmers in state of Minnesota who are protesting the building of power lines across their land. And also Buffalo, Minnesota was not mentioned in this episode. (It was possible to confuse with Buffalo, New York)

Peter Boyles from DENVER'S TALK STATION said,""I don't think many people in our country appreciate people going to an enemy and singing songs.""
Did he mean Soviet Union was an enemy? And also I think a conflict between Dean Reed and him happened not just because of telling his personal opinion about Marxist governments. Dean tried completing his speech how he saw poverty in South American countries. However Peter interrupted him often. Dean noticed to Peter that he was talking as neo-Nazis when he loudly tried imposing mind about Marxist government responsibilities for starving people in those countries.
Early in this movie we can understand Peter Boyles had a habit interrupting callers, too.

The part of movie about preparation for making feature film ""Wounded Knee"" was not bad. However I would put song ""Wounded Knee In 73"" as soundtrack. It could make content of this part less sad than it was.

 However I can't say like this movie was pointless.

For myself I did learn about Lana, Russian-speaking lady, who cared about Dean's grave in Colorado. Therefore I was not only ex Soviet person in the United States who did not forget about Dean Reed. (I am Ukrainian guy and American citizen since 2004.)

And also I liked that an actor Armin Mueller-Stahl said, ""I think he actually tried to build bridges."" Although he does not say a direct word but from his further comment we could understand that he meant bridges between people from different countries and political systems. Therefore Dean Reed tried to build bridges of peace. It is no more Cold Wars between the United States of America and Soviet Union (Especially last one dissolved.)
However the world is missing him and needs people like he was even now.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this movie for people who start learn about
Dean Reed. (Instead I recommend ""American Rebel"" movie by Will Roberts.) However I recommend this movie to learn more information about him.",1264809600,2,3779,4.748475609756097
