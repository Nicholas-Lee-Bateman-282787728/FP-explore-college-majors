It will present stance work, interception of opponent attack, in highline and midline, basic knife defense, including many options involving these ranges. Punches and elbows should the opponent continue his attack, he will simply be met with more counters. I am now involved in the distance learning program because of this product. It's an excellent supplement to your existing art.  I return to this DVD and continue learning. Guru Plinck has many other DVDs available for purchase.",1491955200,2,526,5.188235294117647

8291953,4,B001D6OW2M,"I don't have experience in this system, so I found it good to work and learn a few basic concepts that would complement the combat ju-jutsu that I've learned. I love the fluidity of elbow use in this system. It does provide drills to help you work toward the coordination needed. At minimum, it enhances the awareness of the effect and use of elbows in close fighting. Recommend this video for your reference collection.",1365724800,3,420,4.6891891891891895
8291954,4,B001D6OW2M,I really enjoyed this video!  First off i received the video very quickly so that was good from the start.  If your one who loves silat then you will love this video.  Love the realistic training methods that he uses.  easy to follow along.  Something great for any martial artist to add to his/her bag of tricks and as i call it my gumbo!!!  Good Job,1348185600,,351,4.242424242424242
8291955,2,B001D6OW2M,I found this video just short of worthless. It gives you a basic idea of some of the moves in Pentjak Silat but nothing more.,1279584000,2,125,4.04
8291956,5,B001D6OW2M,"Definitely worth the money, this video concentrates on laws and principle by using techniques to demonstrate.

So if you want 'techniques' they are here, but more important are the laws (always true) and principle (highly useful but context dependent) which GUIDE the technique.

Much here to learn and practice.

So far, this is my favorite Silat video, and (at least) one of my favorite martial arts videos.

Excellent demonstrations, even better explanations.  Guru* Plinck is a REAL TEACHER and COACH.

He is of the Paul de Thouars lineage.

*Guru is (one of) the official titles in Silat for a teacher, much like Sensei in Japanese arts, so if you are new to Silat don't be put of by the title.",1216944000,7,699,4.775
