There were some laughs but not many and I had seen them all in the previews. The storyline isn't that interesting, the romance is dull, the comedy is boring. So really all-in-all, not a great film.",1252800000,,332,4.370967741935484
3941984,1,B002KLAL88,This Movie Blowsssssss. Don't Waste Your Money.  I went into the movies thinking this movie was going to be really funny.  I was really let down.  The low budget similiar movie Homo Erectus a.k.a. National Lampoon's The Stoned Age was much funnier.  In this movie jack black eats crap literally and Michael Cera drinks urine literally.  Jack Black jokes about banging his mom.  I laughed a couple of times but this movie is really bad it should have been way better save your money and watch it on cable if you must.  I would give this movie 0 stars out of 5 if I could.,1251590400,2,570,4.371428571428571
3941985,5,B002KLAL88,"This was an extremely funny movie and had great gags, hilarious references to Biblical history, and much more! Jack Black was incredibly funny as a lazy hunter named Zed, and Michael Cera plays his friend who is a gatherer named Oh. When Zed is caught eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he is banished from the tribe, but Oh decides to join him. They run into Cain and Able, meet Abraham, who is fixing to kill his son Isaac, stop Maya and Eema from becoming slaves, and much more! If you are a hardcore Christian, you may not like this movie, but it's all in good fun! I highly recommend YEAR ONE!!!",1250899200,3,617,4.327586206896552

Usually I really enjoy things that Jack Black and Michael Cera are in. I have only walked out of one movie in my whole life, this was it.
The script I'm fairly confident was written by a few 6th grade boys and the entire movie is a series of mediocre or just plain thoughtless dick jokes. Apparently this appeals to some. I prefer comedies with at least a shred of wit to them. After about an hour and 7,000 dick jokes I thought to myself. One more and I'm just gonna leave. Within 2 seconds there was another and I was outtie. May this movie burn in a garbage fire and be lost to the world forever is my prayer.",1508803200,,616,4.099173553719008

3942114,5,B002KLAL88,"Suspend the belief that cave men talk like yuppies and you will get a kick out of this film.
I laughed from the opening credits (full disclosure - Big Jack Black fan).
All the characters have their moments with funny dialogues, even ones with 1 minute on camera (witch doctor describes Black's problems with ""you really F#$% the pooch on this one""). This is one of those movies that is funnier the second time because of the many one liners from every member of the cast. Dialogue sounds like a Stand Up comedy routine at a club.
Jack and Michael Cera are great together and carry this movie to a 5 star comedy.

Nothing too funny with some Ewww moments... Some poop, fart jokes and just plain stupidity but not really funny.  If Austin Powers is too much for you (which I liked btw), this is not for you.  Even if you like slapstick funny and stupid moments (I'm a sucker for that too), you still might not like it.  If you like poop jokes, body parts and sexual innuendos then yes.. Watch it.

I don't understand the hate.unless people expected this to be a mixture of Tenacious D and Superbad, then I could see the disappointment, but that's not what this movie is all about.

This movie resonated with me because I also am a fan of history, and if you are versed in biblical history and ancient history, it hits on a lot of historical topics in very funny ways as the two characters kind of move forward through history as they transverse through their world.  If you think about the historical context then the jokes and situations are so much funnier.",1396224000,3,734,4.545454545454546

Just pick any other Jack Black performance and you will have a better time.",1388966400,,426,5.115942028985507
3942363,5,B002KLAL88,"Easily i'd say top ten. Though again, I tend to be bias. In the case of this being pre-history and one of my favorite topics, there is a lot. (most people do this but don't admit it. I.E. It's ""Not funny"" if they don't get the jokes)

Regardless, to quickly summarize this movie is fantastic until around 3/4 through it. The rest is actually not that interesting at all. And if I remember correctly, the ending was kind of weak.

In depth, It doesn't matter. Because I have had more laughs in that first 3/4 than I have had in almost any movie I have seen. If you get enough of the obvious and subtle references it is great. I absolutely love the theme that it's two English speaking, modern minded people, living in pre-history or ""biblical times"". The way almost all characters see things and communicate is really what makes this golden to me. It's a reflection of our own reactions when we for example first here that Judaism (and America) decided to whack off that quarter inch of foreskin on male penises.

Lastly, the problems are almost as if they ran out of jokes once they hit sodom. Most the writing feels very stretched to fill the void of time left. and there is about 1/4th the amount of good jokes as before. That and that even though the ending really speaks to the heart and I believe is a good theory of what the world should evolve to become (democratical and free), I feel the way they presented it/dialouged it out is very dry and doesn't hit as hard as it could've.

Overall this movie is nearing 9.5/10 with me, and is in my top 3. If I had to be honest it's one of the contenders for number 1. Though I never say anything is a 10/10 or a ""Number 1"".",1388102400,5,1673,4.301587301587301

Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) are a couple of primitive villagers who get kicked out and/or leave the village because Zed ate a golden apple from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was forbidden. The shaman said he had to leave or he'd bring bad luck to the whole village. Reluctantly, his friend Oh came along with him.

They soon meet two brothers, Cain and Abel, who are constantly arguing. I guess you know what happens to them. The fact that Zed and Oh meet with several characters out of Bible history does not in any way make this a Bible story. In fact, quite the reverse. Nor could it really be said to be blasphemy, in that it is so very obviously comic fiction.

Jack Black is in superb form (way better than in School of Rock), Michael Cera was an inspired choice to play his sidekick and the rest of the cast, including comedian David Cross and footballer turned actor Vinnie Jones play it just right. But the real revelation here is Oliver Platt, whose transformation into the ultra-gay High Priest is so complete I found myself googling which middle-aged British comedian had been cast in the role.
The reviewers below who compare `Year One' to `Life of Brian' need their heads examined. They are totally different genres and don't even play out in the same time period for christ's sake! Year One is closer to the 60s British comedy tradition of the `Carry On...' vein - high-camp, gentle satire that the whole family can enjoy. In fact, at the risk of sounding pretentious, Year One is a rare example of the successful marriage of American and British comedy styles.
Importantly, the whole thing gels. The chemistry between Black and Cara keeps the momentum of the movie from getting dull, and only occasionally do things falter.

3942431,5,B002KLAL88,"The first thing that all these 1 star reviews tells me, is that a large portion of our population has become mind-numb to the subtleties and nuances of comedic brilliance. Perhaps they just prefer loud HD boom-booms, realistic CGI bang-bangs, and pointless choppy action with overblown special effects? Who knows?

The movie begins by taking us into a hunter/gatherer village where we meet Black and Cera's characters, Zed and Oh. The chemistry between the two is immediate and within minutes the movie has you smiling. After Zed wreaks a little havoc and eats of the tree of knowledge, he is sent away from the village, Oh joining him somewhat reluctantly. After leaving, their village is raided and the village, including the love interests of the duo, are taken captive. What ensues is Zed and Oh on a hilarious, distracted and mishap filled quest to save them, meeting great characters along the way, such as Adam, Cain (played by David Cross) and Abel, Abraham and Isaac and a most delightful and entertaining high priest (played by Oliver Platt).

But Year One is without a doubt a fantastic comedy. Jack Black and Michael Cera have a unique chemistry that works marvelously to deliver their lines with comedic brilliance that simply made this movie. I doubt any other duo would have pulled this off, and without Black and Cera, Year One would have probably been deserving of one star reviews. Add to the delightful comedy delivered through Black and Cera's excellent chemistry, an extremely entertaining David Cross, and you have comedy gold. Cross is often under-rated and overlooked in his roles, but his addition as the character Cain, was perfect. As well as Cross' supporting role, we have Oliver Platt playing the flamboyant high priest with such genius and charisma, he easily competes with Cera in stealing some very funny scenes. Platt's role was incredible and I couldn't imagine anyone playing it better.

Some may complain that Jack Black was too Jack Black, and Michael Cera was too Michael Cera; but that's what makes us like them. We fell for their own unique quirky acting styles, and to ask for different in a comedic, satirical adventure movie like this is nonsense. Do I want to see Cera be more like Vin Diesel? Of course not. Would we like to see Black be more Dinero-esque? Not at all. We like Black and Cera precisely because they are Black and Cera, and this seems to have been lost on many reviewers. And the criticisms leveled against this film in regard to depth and historical accuracy are simply puerile. This is a light, relax-and-enjoy-it, type of comedy - not a deep search of soul with a few well placed laughs. And historical accuracy? Really? You can't exactly be ""historically accurate"" about events, such as Abraham/Isaac, Cain/Abel, Sodom, tree of knowledge, etc., which never happened. Mythology is always open to licentia poetica, and often makes for entertaining interpretations of classic legends. Such silly criticisms are likely just visceral responses from those who simply dislike Black and/or Cera, or from those who find such playful, light comedies to be ""beneath"" them. For me, I'm hoping very much to see Black and Cera return for 'Year Two.' But the myopic reviews of alleged ""film critics"" may have squashed any hope of a sure to be fantastic sequel.

If you are a fan of comedy films which don't ask you to search your soul, ponder pretentious issues, or question paradigms, but rather draw you toward a relaxing break where you can simply sit back, enjoy the absurd, and laugh at both slapstick and nuanced humor, then check the film out. But if you think a little too much of yourself, and don't quite understand full spectrum of comedy, then you may be a little too narrow-minded and reserved to appreciate the wonderful comedy of this film.

Perhaps I'm just happy with the fact that Jack Black maintains his normal character compared to his other comedy roles and blends it with Michael Cera's typical character.  I recall how hilarious Michael was in Arrested Development, and I believe his performance here is quite similar. Now, like I said I'm no Jack Black fan, but taking his style and combining it with Michael Cera's really worked for me.

The storyline itself (along with the source of humor) is extremely whacky, focusing on long long ago during the Biblical times (hence the name of the film) and basically making a mockery of the entire time period. I can see how some people would be offended I suppose, but for me, I'm not the least bit offended.

In fact, the storyline is so outrageous that it's best to just treat the entire film as nothing more than a cheap comedy. That's all it really is anyway. Throw in some slapstick humor, and well, that just about sums it up.

I just happened to find many of the segments absolutely hysterical. The two brothers beating the crap out of each other out in the field with the one rock-wielding brother not knowing when to stop, to the scene involving a potential ""private part snipping"", to the first time the two warriors experience what it's like to ride on wheels (which might honestly have some accuracy to it, you know).

3942450,3,B002KLAL88,"Warning if you believe the old testament word for word, do not see this movie as it will undoubtedly offend you!

This is just another case of a comedian (Jack Black) doing a movie based mostly on slapstick/childish humor without a real storyline.

If the movie was to mock the history of humankind represented in the old testament, it spent most of the time just mishmashing parts of the bible into a nonsensical stand up comedy. While this might work in an SNL skit, it should not be dragged out into a 100 minute long movie.

short synopsis, the movie begins with the beginning of humankind (biblical timeline) where one cavemen (played by Jack Black) eats the forbidden fruit to obtain godlike knowledge & his sidekick ""O"" (played by Michael Cera) is compelled to follow him throughout most of the movie.

Kicked out (of I guess paradise) by their tribe for having eaten the forbidden fruit, the two cavemen venture forth into the unknown stumbling from one biblical storyline to the next.

There seemed little purpose in this movie except the use of satire on parts of the old testament. While I do not think the humor is that bad, I agree with most that it is not great either and without a real storyline to go by, the movie lacks any purpose or motive for one to watch it.

Compare this to Monty Python's ""The Life of Brian"" and you may understand why  a storyline is so desperately needed.

Unlike ""The Life of Brian"", ""Year One"" jumps from one story to the next and there is no real purpose to their adventures except at the end when it is indicated that no one person is chosen by God to lead/follow any particular belief/ritual, but that all are chosen by God to make her/his own decision as to what is right or wrong. Pretty weak and a bit of a copout if you are trying to make a point in a movie.

Oh well, I do not hate it because I saw it on cable, but if I had to pay for it in a movie theater, I could understand those who gave it one or two stars.",1293580800,,1966,4.320652173913044

It is also filled with the ridiculous, such as when one of the heroes is chained upside down in prison and pees, and the urine flows down over his head, or when he saves a virgin from being a sacrifice by having sex with her.

 The story begins when one of two foolish cave men friends eats the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and thinks that he has suddenly and miraculously become smart. But the other inhabitants of the cave men village exile him for his sin, and he discovers the use of fire when he accidentally burns down the village. His friend joins him in the exile. They decide to go to the end of the earth and see the phenomenon.

 They run into Cain and Abel on the other side of the mountain and see the former kill the later. They drive in a cart, which has wheels, a new invention they had never seen before, and become seasick in the slow ox-pulled cart. There is a slow moving ox-cart chase when Cain's father chases him because of the murder. The two cave men encounter Abraham and stop him from sacrificing his son Isaac. When Abraham tells them that he heard from God that he needs to cut people's foreskin, they escape to the city of joy, Sodom. There they learn that it hasn't rained for a long time.

Well, to me, the film is not as terrible as critics led me to think, with some funny moments here and there, though I must admit the film just mildly funny, compared with the brilliant and ingenious Bill Murray comedy.

The film follows the misadventures of Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera), two prehistoric misfits who are forced to leave their community when Zed a failed hunter eats a forbidden fruit. After some ""comedic"" episodes that are based on Old Testament (Abel and Cain, for instance), Zed and Oh learn that the girls they wanted to date Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple) are kidnapped and sold as slaves, so they head for the city of Sodom to rescue them.

I know the film is not meant for Oscar. I know the unlikely duo of Zed and Oh is supposed to be silly and vulgar. What disappointed me most is that for all its silliness and vulgarity, the film is very tame. Instead of seeking inspiration for comedy in its biblical setting, the film plays it safe, relying on one-liners and toilet jokes. Michael Cera covered in his own urine?

The comic gags seem to miss the mark more times than not or are petty and juvenile. Michael Cera pretty much acts exactly like he does in every other movie he's been in (see Juno, Superbad, etc). Jack Black has been able to actually ""act"" in certain films, and get into various characters and still give his own personality to a role (School of Rock comes to mind), but this one he kind of just mails in and plays what he knows best, being overbearingly obnoxious without any restraint.

After Jack Black's character is banished from the village after eating from the Tree of Knowledge, he and Michael Cera stumble around as cavemen during prehistoric times and encounter several religious figures and events (Cain, Abel, Abraham). There is an attempt to satirize and lampoon these events, such as Cain killing Abel, but the humor doesn't really work and seems a little awkward or just not funny.

As one reviewer noted, it is amazing that someone could mess up a comedy about two cavemen wandering around, but they've found a way to do it. Watch the trailer, and leave it at that.

3942486,3,B002KLAL88,"This movie was humerous and engaging and on blu ray it looks great. One thing that surprised me is the unrated version is not very risque as I thought it would be either. This movie is actually a good family comedy in which Two mountain tribesmen travel down to the plains of canaan circa 3,000 b.c. or so. Which is hardly 'year one' as far as civilization goes, it's much older than that. It has many biblical characters and musings about old testament  religion and a trip to Sodom of the plains.
 The movie isn't a laughfest really but it's not a terrible A movie by any means the two lead characters are decent guys who the audience can relate to and that helps.  This movie is of course over the top with Abraham existing the same time as Adam and Eve , plus Cain and Abel , which is out of sequence with the old testament. I can't say that this is the type of comedy like the ""mask' or 'there's something about mary"" , ""the producers""  or the 'ghostbusters"" even. The last one was a brainchild of Harold Ramis too, it's more laid back I think. I think people often want those type of comedies and don't give alot of other types a chance.  However this is no 'school of rock' and it is closer to 'wholly moses""  which was more slapsticky than this one. Comedy is a hard gig and with this one you get a high budget flick with great sets and very good actors who make a decent movie.
The extras on this one are many with lots of deleted scenes and a alternate ending even.",1266796800,,1475,4.2313167259786475

Did you like that humor? It was kinda funny the first time but after the 10th time it had only become geometrically less funny? Well if you do, then buy a ticket to Year One, because that's the formula here. You get the same type of humor over and over and over again. The actors all do the style of humor they have done several times before, but this time they really seem to just stumble through the motions. So it's like watching a movie with Zombie Jack Black and Zombie Michael Cera and Zombie David Gross shambling through their routines. Maybe the gags were funnier on paper or maybe the actors were all really tired when they were improving, but most of the humor falls flat. Little kids might like the gross out humor, but they will have a hard time sitting still through all the long, boring parts. The plot, Black and Cera are loser hunter-gatherers who get kicked out of their tribe and decide to rescue their would-be girlfriends from slavers, isn't bad for a zany comedy. I think Hope and Crosby could have pulled a ""Road"" movie out of it. And I would like to see Jack Black and Michael Cera star in another movie together again, because they do seem to have some comedy chemistry, believe it or not. I'd just like their next movie to be actually, consistently funny.

The story line is paper-thin, but there are a lot of funny ""bits"" along the way. Oliver Platt does a great, over-the-top performance as the High Priest; Olivia Wilde is stunning as the Princess, and there are numerous amusing appearance by various comic actors.

3942498,2,B002KLAL88,"If you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE with any regularity...you know that it's mostly an exercise in frustration. Usually there are a few really funny moments surrounded by 90% completely half-baked material that evokes more a feeling of embarrassment for the actors than laughter. And at the end of the 90 minute show, the feeling you're left with is ""well, THAT wasn't worth the trouble.""

YEAR ONE is much like that. There are a few pretty funny bits, surrounded by a lot of painfully unfunny stuff. Even worse, I believe it is the movie that has finally convinced me that Jack Black has worn out his welcome. (And Michael Cera isn't far behind...big sigh!)

Black reached his ""height"" for me with SCHOOL OF ROCK (although I liked him in ORANGE COUNTY a lot too). The movie was perfect for his skills...a manic, over-the-top rock `n' roller with a soft heart. He was immensely likeable and his energy and love of rock shone through. Since that time, his comedies have had ever decreasing returns. NACHO LIBRE only worked to the extent that you had good feelings for Black. He worked so hard, you could practically see the flop-sweat...as though the sheer force of his personality would make the film funny. BE KIND REWIND, though in some ways delightfully quirky, didn't work in the end due in large part to Black's brash tone not suiting the more laid-back nature of the film. Even in the wonderful TROPIC THUNDER, Black's performance was the least satisfactory. And all this marginal work has slowly chipped away my goodwill, until with YEAR ONE, Black exhausted it.

Black plays a ""cave man"" who is a lousy hunter and yet feels the burning certainty that something greater awaits him. When he is caught eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good & Evil...he is banished from the tribe. Michael Cera is a gatherer (all other gatherers are women) who pines for Black's attractive younger sister...but is essentially meek and nerdy...not at all suitable for a tribe of cave men. He joins Black on his journey, and as they travel through land, they also seem to travel forward in time. They find themselves in ""biblical"" times, where they meet Cain & Abel (David Cross & Paul Rudd) and then eventually land in the city of Sodom...where Black finally finds a chance to aim for the greatness that has eluded him, when several members of his old tribe suddenly turn up as slaves (think 10,000 B.C., if by chance you endured THAT lousy movie.)

So the movie is a satire of cave man movies, but more particularly of Biblical epics and the bible itself. It is not particularly mean-spirited...so the humor isn't very pointed, and the film, at least, doesn't seem ""anti-religious"" in particular.

For me, the best bits included Hank Azaria as a slightly crazed Abraham, a prophet eager to carry out God's desire for his people to be circumcised. His delivery is a combination of someone like Omar Sharif and a televangelist. Other cute bits include Cera's efforts to become a living statue, Oliver Platt's outrageously ridiculous turn as the high priest of Sodom and...well, that's about it.

The cast, on paper, was promising. Michael Cera, who built up what I thought was a lifetime of good will with his hilarious work on ""Arrested Development"" and in JUNO here demonstrates that too much of a good thing really is too much. His stock character was perfect for SUPERBAD, but lost some of its luster with NICK & NORAH and in YEAR ONE...most of his goodwill is gone. While he was certainly funnier than Black...it was also painfully obvious that he was pretty much coasting by simply borrowing from his familiar mannerisms and delivery. It's essential that he find something to do in the future that shakes this up, even a little bit. David Cross (also beloved from ""Arrested..."") plays the fratricidal Abel and he manages to do absolutely nothing funny. He's trying very hard, but all his bits play like the sketches that come at the VERY end of SNL, when they're just trying to fill 5 minutes before they can wave goodbye. And Paul Rudd is Cain. We know Cain won't last as long as Abel...and his scene is very short indeed. And it's a good thing, because Cain is also not remotely funny and when the end comes for Rudd, I could only imagine how relieved he must have been to be able to get out of costume and head home.

This has all been directed by Harold Ramis...but I use the term loosely. Very little skill is shown. The pace and tone of the film are all over the place. He does very little with his camera work to hide the tiny budget he was working with. And the jokes are clumsy. It feels like some of Mel Brooks' later work...the comic style that once felt fresh has become old and tired. Ramis was once a great director (and can still be a funny performer...loved him in KNOCKED UP), but YEAR ONE is not a proud moment. Judd Apatow has his name marginally attached to this film...I wish he'd had the power or foresight to just pull the plug.

In 1975, YEAR ONE might have gotten by as an inferior but tonally related companion to YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Now it just plays like a very long, very tired, stylistically anachronistic TV sketch.",1261958400,,5142,4.6677704194260485

I have watched other Amazon Video on Demand HD TV shows, so, I know it is capable of HD, but this was not it.

As to the movie itself, it was pretty lame. And it wasn't due to the video quality. Normally, when in the mood, I can laugh heartily at a funny Jack Black role, or an Apatow production.

I mean, when you eat a handful of BBQ chips they are great, but when you are eating one after another they start to taste a bit weird and not so appetizing.

With Black we got to see something different back in 2005 and it was great but then he went right back into his typecast characters and hasn't let up yet. Even when voice acting in kids movies he give a similar performance.

3942527,5,B002KLAL88,"I seem to find myself in the minority here, but I actually liked ""Year One"".  Having seen it in the theater, I thought it was a fairly fun and light-hearted experience all around.  The humor is perhaps not as broad as some prefer-but myself, I sort of enjoyed the subtleties.  These type of films usually benefit from a second or even third viewing if you give them a chance.

In ""Year One"", Jack Black plays his part adequately but seems to yield the majority of the spotlight to his on-screen cohort Michael Cera.  Michael Cera is the real star of ""Year One"" and Black seems to know it-taking a step back for the younger comedic actor to really shine.  Cera's comedic delivery is dry and spot-on for his character ""Oh"" and he plays the part with real charismatic charm.  In short, it is Cera's film, not Black's-and I wouldn't have had it any other way.

When it comes down to it, Year One is just a harmless little diversionary film which doesn't take itself too seriously and nor should you.  I personally thought it had a lot of wit and charm.  Perhaps it just didn't strike the majority of audiences in the same way.  That's too bad too because personally, I found this film far more entertaining than some of the summer's bloated special effects films.

3942528,1,B002KLAL88,"Yeah, those are my sentiments exactly.  The thing was, I knew this was going to be one of those `gotta be in the right mood' kind of slapstick comedies in the vein of nearly everything else Jack Black has done, which means it is going to be colorful if you get my drift; the thing is, I never really expected this.  The film is colorful all right, maybe too much so.

With one off-color joke after another (stuff I wouldn't even want a teenager to hear) and a slew of suggestive innuendo, `Year One' is NOT a film for the whole family.  Listen, I'm not a zealot for wholesome entertainment or anything like that, but when this kind of material serves absolutely no purpose (they aren't even funny half the time, just rather awkward and gross) then it's better off left on the cutting room floor.

It kind of reminds me of the demise of Adam Sandler.

So Zed is a failed hunter who is more a laughing stock to his tribe than anything else.  Oh is his only friend; a dorky gatherer who lusts after Zed's sister Eema.  When Zed eats of the forbidden fruit he is expelled and Oh follows him (sort of by necessity).  The rest of the tribe ends up forced into slavery, including Eema and Maya, the girl who Zed is crushing over, and so they decide to concoct a plan to rescue them; but they are stupid (at least Zed is) and so he pretty much fails a lot before getting it right.

Michael Cera is funny.  I know that a lot of people kind of hate him now that he is everywhere, but he is really funny.  His delivery just makes everything he says hit just right, and if it weren't for him I would have turned off the movie.  In fact, even with him I came awfully close to turning it off a few times, it was that grating on my nerves.

And I really wanted this to be funny...

Jack Black is really an acquired taste, a taste that I have yet to fully acquire I guess.  I like him sometimes, but most times he's just obnoxious.  Parts of this film he nails, the rest he falls flat on his face.  Oliver Platt is ridiculous here, but he manages to make me laugh a few times (when he tried to curse that one guy I laughed), but for the most part he's a clichd stereotype that is more disgusting and uncomfortable than anything else.  Juno Temple and June Diane Raphael and especially Olivia Wilde are merely here for eye candy, and they serve their purpose.

Oh, and did I mention that this is one of the most sacrilegious films I've ever seen.  I mean, I understand humor and I understand religious interpretation but this film mocks scripture so much I was stunned...

I loathe David Cross here.

I'd skip this one unless you are such a die hard fan of Black (why would anyone be?) that you HAVE to see it.

None of the events depicted in this movie took place in the year one; for starters, the opening scenes depict a prehistoric existence of hunting, gathering, and living in huts, suggesting a movie that's set thousands of years before the year one.  Are Zed and Oh supposed to be walking through time portals after they're exiled from their village?  That would explain how they amble through Biblical and historical events from completely different time periods.  I'm all for respectfully tinkering with certain aspects of history to make characters or a story more relevant to a modern viewer, but completely changing entire characters or storylines?  Lilith is supposed to be Adam's lesbian daughter instead of his apocryphal first wife?  Abraham is having everyone circumcised after the Akedah (near-sacrifice of Isaac) instead of when Isaac was only 8 days old?  Roman characters are romping through Sodom and Gomorrah and the Middle Eastern desert?  I was half-expecting them to stumble upon Noah building his ark after leaving Sodom, at the rate they were going!

I might have been able to somewhat ignore all of the liberties taken with actual history and Biblical characters if the story itself had actually been interesting and the jokes had been funny.  But the attempts at humor are geared towards 12 year olds, like Zed eating feces, Oh having urine dripping into his mouth and nose, Oh having to rub hot oil on the gross hairy chest of a high priest who looks like an overweight hairy version of Boy George, circumcision jokes, male virgin jokes, eunuch jokes, flatulence jokes, and Zed and Oh vomiting after Cain takes them for a ride in a cart with wheels.  Most of the funny moments take place in the first section of the movie, in the hunting and gathering society.  I love slapstick comedy, but this went beyond lowbrow but funny humor to just plain vulgar and tasteless.  The plot itself was pretty thin and stupid, Zed and Oh trying to get their love interests Maya and Eema out of slavery so they can all escape together.  Maybe it would've been more interesting if there hadn't been so much gross-out humor that most people don't find side-splittingly hilarious past elementary school, and if it hadn't wandered all over the place in terms of historical events and eras.

I'm glad we only rented this one, and for once I agree with the one-star review my boyfriend gave the product.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  It's not even at the level of a guilty pleasure.",1256688000,4,3116,4.799625468164794

Jack Black should sent to an island where he there is no media for him to produce anything. The guy has made nothing worth watching execpt The Jackel where he makes that gun and gets blown up by Bruce Willis. Second of all nothing against Homosexuals but I think Cera is ... just by the way he acts all his movies are about him debating where he should or should not hook up with girls. Ok overall this superbad minus Seth and other ... replaced with a moron (jack black) in The times of the bible... over ='s a waste of a dollar even to rent at a movie machine. so stay away this is not even worth it at all,1256688000,6,754,3.9671052631578947
3942533,4,B002KLAL88,"I've read a couple of critical reviews of this movie and can't help but laugh at the disdain for this movie.  I don't see how people expected greatness and depth out of a movie with Jack Black set in prehistoric and biblical times.  I mean could they not see that by looking at the cover with a clean shaven, doe eyed Cera cast as a caveman?  You want comedic depth, go watch ""Best in Show"" or ""Arrested Development"".  You want silly and mindless toilet humor, then watch this.

I didn't go into this movie expecting an Oscar worthy movie or ground breaking performance, in fact nobody should.  This movie is obviously intended for you to shut your brain down and let go for a couple of hours.  I really enjoyed this movie and love Black in these type of roles.  Cera plays the same role as he did in ""Superbad"" which isn't a bad thing since he's perfect as the shy awkward guy.  You get that this movie is going in a whole different direction from the on-set of the movie when the cavemen speak with current day dialogue.  It's right at that point where you're either sticking with it or bailing because even the most novice move watcher knows that this isn't ""History of the World"".  If you like stuff from the Apatow troupe then this movie might be up your alley.  If you don't get the Apatow reference then you obviously won't get this movie.",1256515200,23,1346,4.4048582995951415
3942534,4,B002KLAL88,"I was expecting a very overblown performance out of Jack Black. He is kind of the Chris Farley of this generation, however, he managed to reign in his schtick a bit and came up with a pretty decent act.

The most shocking thing about the movie was the initial caveman setting and expecting grunts and unintelligible words, maybe with captions. However, the moment the cast started speaking, it was apparent this was not going to be either historically accurate, or even a far stretch in that direction.

What really makes this movie is the dialogue, which is far out of the historical setting. And, going from cavemen to bible history within a long hike shows that this is strictly for laughs, and not any sort of technical accuracy.

Oliver Platt is outrageous as the high priest of Sodom and Xander Berkley is great as the king. David Cross is unrecognizable with his beard, and the one I most easily recognized was Horatio Sanz. I'm glad to see him working.

Olivia Wilde is absolutely hot here, as well as Jack's love interest.

I watched the unrated version and the only place I saw a big shocker was the bear dung scene. If you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Overall, this was a fun movie I could see watching again, just to catch more of the goofy dialogue. Recommended.",1256515200,2,1295,4.608695652173913
3942535,3,B002KLAL88,"My wife and I enjoy watching DVDs late at night and I, more often or not, allow her the choice of viewing. She picks up new DVDs from the bins of our local warehouse store. Our latest viewing was ""Year One."" We had the choice of watching either the theatrical or unrated editions and we opted for the latter.

It's a dim-witted story of two guys getting kicked out of prehistoric tribe and wandering until they find civilization. The people they run into are a melange of early biblical characters. It's supposed to be a comedy, of course, and it's mildly humorous from here to there, with a certain amount of slapstick, low-brow puns and sight gags. OK, it's not much as a story, but I found it mildly amusing. In a lot of places, it just couldn't hold my attention, however. I'm sure the reliance on biblical religious characters and making jokes out of them is going to offend a lot of people. So be it. I was not offended and, without it, the story would simply have been moronic. Actually, even with them the story was moronic, but, relax, it's a comedy.

Year One provided a humorous interlude at the end of a busy day. That was it's purpose. I don't want a deep thinking, spell binder just before I go to bed. I often judge DVDs by asking whether I would ever view this disc the second time. After all, we paid for it and it becomes a part of our little DVD library. Well, the answer is no.

Cera's dead pan delivery is also very funny and that caveman wig....is priceless.

This film is going to appeal to fans of the two stars and probably not too many others.

3942539,3,B002KLAL88,"Year One, isn't as bad as most reviewers would like you to think. The movie is pretty simple. Its about two primitive men, played by Black and Cera, who are kicked out of thier village leaving behind the two women they love and on the way to find a new place to settle they realize that thier old village was taken over and all the people they left behind are now slaves. They meet Cain and Abel, Abraham and Isaac, eventually ending up in the ciy of Sodom where thier friends are servants for the king. Its full of biblical references, jokes about circumcision, sacrifice, and of course the city of sodom itself. Its not the funniest, cleverest movie out there but its funny nevertheless. I myself laughed a ton, but I also have read the bible and get the humor.

Jack Black does his usual wide eyed, blutoesque behavior while Cera does his usual low key sarcasm and mumbling. Is it old? a bit, does it work here? Absolutely. Its worth a rent, maybe not to buy unless you are huge fans of Harold Ramis, Jack Black, or Michael Cera.

Black and Cera play Zed and Oh respectively, two pre-historic losers in the Biblical era, getting in all sorts of mischief that frequently involves genital and fart jokes.  Along the way we see familiar comedic faces and Judd Apatow vets like David Cross, Paul Rudd, Hank Azaria, Bill Hader, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse; to go along with Vinnie Jones, Oliver Platt, Black's Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass, the ridiculously hot Olivia Wilde, and even Ramis himself.  As a whole, Year One delivers a decent enough amount of laughs to warrant it worth viewing, but there isn't anything here that you haven't seen here plenty of times before, and seen done better either.

3942553,4,B002KLAL88,"I just wanted to write a short review from my little world.

I saw this movie when it came out and laughed my butt off in the theatre.  I bought the poster from the theatre, too... heh.  I understand that the roles were typical for Jack Black & Michael Cera, but I haven't seen either one of them in many movies, so I can't say if this is true.  Standing by itself, though, without having seen (many if any) other performances, the movie is a solid YES in my book.

I am a massive Harold Ramis fan - more of his philosophy than his movies - but the movies, certainly a close second.  If I'm having a ""what's the point?"" kind of day, I just love to pop in a Harold Ramis commentary to listen to while I'm puttering around ... they're the BEST for making me feel so much better - he's just that inspiring.  When I found out that a new Harold Ramis movie was coming out, I was perhaps overly excited for it - and especially in anticipating the DVD commentary.  In a previous movie, ""Bedazzled,"" there were two commentary tracks, which was fabulous.  I wish they'd done that for this movie.  They have Harold Ramis, Jack Black, and Michael Cera together in this one.  The actors are really on a different wavelength from the director, and the result was an extremely disappointing commentary.  If I remember correctly, it went something like this for the duration of the movie:

Michael Cera: Hahaha! [Repeats line] That was a funny line.
Jack Black: Oh, yeah!  Funny.  [Repeats line]
Harold Ramis:  ... Heh heh heh.
Jack Black: Oh boy!  Funny!  Oh... I made up some other jokes like [alt joke]
Michael Cera:  Hehehe.  That was hard.  That was uncomfortable.  [Repeats more lines]
Harold Ramis: ... Yeah, you were funny there.

In parts of the movie, it was honestly hard to tell the difference between the actual soundtrack and the commentary - it was pretty much the same, with a few Harold Ramis giggles thrown in.  All I came away with was that they used the same cougar that was in Talladega Nights, and it was kinda lazy.

It's enough to make you cry.",1255564800,,2053,4.439678284182306
3942554,3,B002KLAL88,"In June 2009, a new comedy film starring Jack Black (""King Kong"", ""Be Kind Rewind"", ""Tropic Thunder"") and Michael Cera (""Juno"", ""Superbad"", ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"") was released in theaters with a large tie-in with the NBA Finals and also featured a commercial aired on Super Bowl XLIII.

The film which was directed and and a screenplay co-written by Harold Ramis (""Ghostbusters"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Stripes"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Meatballs"") and ""The Office"" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg.  The film would be produced by Judd Apatow (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""Pineapple Express"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up""), cinematography by Alar Kivilo (""The Lake House"", ""The Lookout"", ""The Ice Harvest"") and music by Theodore Shapiro (""Marley & Me"", ""Tropic Thunder"", ""Semi-Pro"").

The Blu-ray release includes both the standard theatrical version and the unrated version of the film which has three more minutes of extra footage.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Year One"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and the quality provides excellent detail.  From the detail of the sand in the desert, mountains in the region, trees in the village, detail on the clothing, you name it... the picture quality for ""Year One"" is solid, not reference but still a very good looking film.  Good trace of grain and no DNR (Digital Noise Reduction).

As for the audio, the audio is presented with an English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack with a Spanish 5.1 soundtrack as well.  The Blu-ray features one of the few films that were released from Sony that uses a DTS-HD MA soundtrack instead of Dolby TrueHD.  For a comedy film, audio is satisfactory.  Dialogue is clean and understandable.  For the most part, the film is front and center channel driven but the crack of thunder can be heard quite nicely throughout the channels.  But it's too bad the alternate ending was not used because that is where the majority of the action is featured in the film.  But overall, the lossless audio is fine.

Subtitles are featured in English, French, English SDH, Portuguese and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Year One"" is one of those films that Apatow or even Happy Madison film fans will enjoy.  In other words, films that are comedy-driven, not meant to be taken seriously and for the most part, films that many people tend to see as moronic, idiotic and pushing the button.

For ""Year One"", I will say that for an Apatow-produced film, it was not one of the best films and truthfully, I was surprised this was written by Harold Ramis because it is definitely one of his weakest written films to date.  The funny has its humorous moments and as expected, both Black and Cera are a good pairing.  It's just that the screenplay felt a bit mediocre.

The biggest surprise when watching this Blu-ray is that included is an alternate ending that features more action and although a bit more dark, it was a pretty good ending that of course, people who knows the tragic story of Sodom will understand why the alternate ending was appropriate.  The fact that they spent so much for that ending scene and didn't use it, is quite a surprise and sure, it was bleaker and humorous but I think those action sequences of destruction would have been more entertaining for viewers.  I just felt that the ending Ramis did choose keep, was to saccharine and to easy going.  In the commentary, Ramis said he chose the Obama versus the George W. Bush version.  But personally, for those familiar with the Sodom and Gomorrah storyline expect nothing but destruction of the city of Sodom in someway.

But overall, for those who did enjoy this film will enjoy the fact that the Blu-ray does come with a lot of special features and that the picture quality is pretty solid.  And again, you get both the unrated and theatrical version of the films.  If anything, despite the film's shortcomings, the Blu-ray release for this film is packed with features, Sony really utilizing some of the BD-Live capabilities for this release.  So, if you did enjoy this film, you'll more than likely enjoy this Blu-ray release.",1255564800,,6098,4.8935546875
3942555,2,B002KLAL88,"Year One is written and directed by Harold Ramis and produced by Judd Apatow. These are two men that know comedy, yet this movie has very few laughs. It could have been a funny spoof of films like 10,000 BC and Apocalypto but instead it's pretty boring and forgettable.

  An early scene where Jack Black teaches Cera how to pick up women by hitting them in the head with a club was clver. But sadly that's the one scene I remember being funny. Cavemen picking up women with pick-up lines of today only got small chuckles from me. Many of the other jokes are just tasteless and dumb kind of stuff that you'd expect from the Wayans.

We even went to the midnight showing, because we were all free to do so.

So, here's the skinny: this movie is terrible. The movie had some really tired jokes, such as how hunters were 'cooler' than gatherers. Even the jokes regarding the Bible were stale.

If you go into ""Year One"" looking for Black and Cera to reprise their standard movie roles such as the ones I described you won't be disappointed. Black's weird/stoned facial gestures, Cera's  awkwardness, and Beavis and Butthead-esque jokes comprise the bulk of this movie's humor.

Simply put-I was just in the background in several different scenes. From the ""stoning"" scene to the ""villge"" scene, I'm in the background doing whatever. Now, coming from someone that was on set several different times I can tell you I was HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED in this film. Shooting the movie was far more humorous that the movie itself. I typically like Jack Black's dry wit but something went very wrong in the story line here. Don't get me wrong; Black, Cera, Cook, etc. were friendly & nice. But that's really the only positive thing I can say about this movie. 2 stars were given simply because of the ""star factor""",1254787200,3,811,4.5793103448275865
3942578,4,B002KLAL88,very funny movie alot of slapstick comedy and religious puns if your really unfamilar i mean completely without any idea of the bible then you may not get a few of the jokes but none the less very funny,1254441600,,202,4.205128205128205
3942579,3,B002KLAL88,"This movie appeared much more funny from previews, but seeing it in theaters just did not live up to the hype. As I mentioned in my title it is mostly Jack Black, acting as Jack Black (Loud, Outlandish, Stupid) and Michael Cera acting as his characters usually would (Awkward, shy, quiet) but in a biblical setting.

The movie begins in a small village with Black and Cera as friends. Black is a hunter and Cera is a gatherer. After eating from the tree of knowledge, Black is excommunicated from the village and Cera decides to follow, while the other members of the village are taken prisoner including Cera's love interest.

The story continues leading the characters to several biblical events that are quite entertaining such as meeting Abraham, Cain and Able, Sodom, and many other events. Black and Cera continue on their quest finally liberating the village from their enslavement and capture and Cera becomes a more confident individual and gains the attention of his love interest.

Overall the action is predictable and some of the moments in the movie miss their mark but with a few one liners and some interesting biblical references this movie is pretty good once or twice.",1253750400,26,1187,4.866336633663367
3942580,1,B002KLAL88,"A hunter and gather in the first year of life are kicked out of their village and wander around in biblical times. This film is aboslutely awful! First of all, the events they spoof did not take place in the first year of life. All of them were way after that. It's a stupid comedy, so no one would actually expect any historical accuracy anyways, but the humor is stupid anyways. It tries to appeal to the immature teen audience, but I don't see how any of them could even like it. It failed miserably at the box office. It hits all the gross-outs it possibly can, except for vomit. Michael Cera peeing on himself and Jack Black eating poo just isn't funny. This is a film where I truly want the two hours of my life I spent watching thi back!",1253318400,5,744,4.246478873239437
3942581,1,B002KLAL88,"Great Idea gone horribly wrong.  I wasted money seeing this awful punishment bestowed on my beloved actors.  All the actors in this movie are misused and embarrassed. The movie tries to clutch onto it's only crutch: Gross laughs.  Lets watch Jack Black eat feces and it will be funny.  Michael Cera will rub a man down with oil and people with love it.  NO!  It's absolutely immature and  dissapointing to see directors try to feed us cheap ""laughs"" I cannot laugh to.  There's not a funny prehistoric bone in this film, it's all undone script.  Why didn't they improv?  I know they didn't because they can all find something funnier to say than these mistakes of sentences.  I was extremely sad to see that all of this talent could come crashing down.  They put a huge whole into my collection of these actors' fine work.  I felt like I saw the horrible sequel to Date Movie with the whole movie hinting at how you just wasted your money.  The movie moves along like a toddler on crack, and I was upset to see no plot holes filled or anything explained.  The actors regret this film, and I feel sorry for them.  They were on a winning streak and now they all have dents in their record.  Harold Ramis is getting old and he needs to re-evaluate what's funny.  I thought we've matured to sensible dialogue, some we've seen in Superbad and the other Seth Rogen comedies, but this is just immature garbage.  Say something smart.  Be funny.  Don't just sell me empty jokes.

Don't waste your time.",1252886400,6,1493,4.51310861423221
