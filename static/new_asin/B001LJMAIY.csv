I had to fast forward through most of this one.  Unfortunately the director of this dvd thought  people would be interested in what these guys have to say.  I couldn't care less.  I just want to see the movement.  Like every cool thing in the world people would rather talk about it than do it.  The world needs more Parkour and more videos documenting it.  Next time more action less lip service. Too bad cause all the athletes are talented.  Hearing them blabber about it only stole from the beauty of their skills.  Also, get a few songs.  The same damn song plays through the whole movie!  Nice try.....to bad tryin' is cryin'.  This vid is like a move that could've been epic ,but bails hard in the end.",1241481600,3,839,4.427631578947368
8318239,3,B001LJMAIY,"Although it does have some freestyle parkour in the video, most of it is listening to the guys talk about what parkour ""means"" to them and what each others strengths are. When I purchased the video I had a preconceived notion that it would be a lot more footage of moves and jumps, so I was a bit disappointed. If your into listening into the deeper thoughts of guys who are starting and revolutionizing the sport within the U.S. then I recommend the DVD. But, if your into the cool stuff you see on the internet, then I would just stick to youtube. Just my opinion.",1241395200,8,566,4.349056603773585
8318240,5,B001LJMAIY,More Parkour and Free Running than I have ever seen before! Interesting interviews give insight to the new sport and the differences in the two. Beautiful HD film.,1229558400,3,163,4.857142857142857
8318241,5,B001LJMAIY,"Best Parkour and Free Running video ever! Extra features Rock! I can't believe the Hoover Dam handstand. Cirque du Soleil, Springs' flip over a car, natural Parkour in Red Rock Canyon, and great new music from Grace Over Diamonds make for a great film. NoSole, King, Springs, Sunset and the rest have unbelievable talent.  This is a must-see!",1229472000,3,342,4.896551724137931
