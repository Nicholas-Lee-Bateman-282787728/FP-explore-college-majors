5957742,5,B00EZ228NQ,"This is one as a keeper (not for 50 dollars though) By the title you would think it was on par with Highschool Dxd or MM! but far from it. This story the main character is at a point in a teens life where he needs some direction. The lead girl looks to be autistic but in reality is a major shut in and never was ""taught"" how life works. The teacher who is also the RA (Resident Advisor) seems to be useless but actually shows up and says what needs to be said in always the correct time without being intrusive she actually makes the kids more responsable and to learn their life lessons. The other characters welp to put it plainly they are not so much as ""problem"" kids as they are highly artistic and people at that level don't look at things the same way as mundane people would. In a nut shell there really is no ""fan service"" as this is NOT what this one is about at all but it really hits you when you get to the end to see how everyone develops and matures and learn from oneanother. BTW this is just the first season you have to watch the second one too belive me youll want to after this season",1386720000,9,1105,4.073394495412844
5957743,4,B00EZ228NQ,"This is a grea anime with beautiful visuals and style. The voice acting is top notch and the story is heart warming.

The only two flaws I can give this release are the fact that:

A) There is no dub. This is one unforgivable flaw since Sentai Filmworks has been doing rather well with this recently, dubbing a large number of both great A anime's, and mediocre crap that should have not had a penny thrown into any more than subbing them. I don't get why they choose to not dub this one.

and

B) The price, $49.99 (or $59.98 if you're unfortunate enough to be at a place asking for the full retail asking prince) for a standard release Blu-Ray DVD with only 12 episodes on it + the typical bonus stuff we're use to (Extended promo's, clean op/ed, trailers for other sentai licensed anime's), are you joking? That's highway robbery if you ask me. I'm not blaming amazon for the pricing, this is all on Sentai Filmworks for wanting $60 for a standard retail release. That price, for something that has no dubbing should be reserved for a special edition boxset that has a lot of extra's, NOT a standard blu-ray release... or at least make it a blu-ray DVD combo pack for that price.

In conclusion, Sentai Filmworks... it looks like you've been taking notes from both Capcom, and Aniplex of America... and that's not a good thing. If you want to take notes from anyone look at Funimation. I won't be buying this unless I see it for a mega discount, since it's a sub only, I'll just continue watching it off Crunchyroll since it's legal on that site.",1386633600,3,1549,4.459363957597173
5957744,5,B00EZ228NQ,"The animation is top-notch with some very interesting directorial decisions and art concepts. Great characters, each with well developed personalities without going into the heavy-handed, overwrought drama typical in many anime with so much character development. I know people are disappointed that it is subtitled, but I believe SUBS are the only way to watch anime. I want to hear the voices that the creators heard and the emotions that come through so perfectly in the original language, even though I don't understand a word of it. I can't stand the cognitive dissonance that happens with DUBS. No matter your view on SUBS vs. DUBS, you will not be disappointed by this anime. One of the funniest, most beautiful, kind, and thoughtful shows ever. ENJOY!",1381968000,12,759,5.08
5957745,5,B00EZ228NQ,"Pet Girl of Sakurasou is an amazing anime. Amazingly animated, characters are developed and well realized, and the story is paced well enough with some good drama and humor through out.

The only problem I would see with this release is no dubs. The show is something I felt was one of the funnier anime I have seen and was a rare treat because the humor was not the type that is common place in japanese anime. The humor had a lot of word play, comedic timing, clever witty responses,and reactionary humor. So how would it help if it had dubs? There are a lot of moments in the show where multiple characters are talking, whether because one isn't listening, some other people are having a conversations in the foreground/ background, or because a character won't stop talking even during a response. This made it very common that I would miss jokes since the humor in this show is VERY fast and clever and they would over lap with other dialogue. This would not be an issue if the jokes were parsed out enough that it would give the viewer time to read everyone's dialogue but the humor of the show is very ingrained in fast humor that fires off multiple times from multiple characters at the same time. Although that kind of humor sounds cluttered it works REALLY well and would make it much easier to intake if I wasn't reading 2 to 3 pieces of dialogue at the same time.

Still the show is great and don't take it as though the show has an issue. The show is perfect the way it is and so is the humor. Just a missed opportunity to make it better. One of the few times where dubs would have actually helped the work. Though the release is lacking dubs I won't mark the show down for it since the show is good enough on it's own.

It is very uncommon for an anime to almost completely base it's humor on witty clever responses and expert comedic timing rather than just rest on anime guy yells and runs around like an idiot then gets a bloody nose then gets slapped or beaten with embarrassing moments. As for the drama, it is some of the better stuff I have seen. Not many times can an anime suddenly make your heart sink into your stomach by it uttering a single sentence. An anime definitely worth checking out.",1379116800,15,2217,4.36319612590799
5957746,5,B00EZ228NQ,"this is truly a work of art in my eyes, I even compare this show to clannad, I will not be purchasing this, but if the studio were to make a dubbed, i would certainly buy it without a second thought.",1379116800,,199,3.8780487804878048
5957747,5,B00EZ228NQ,"This show was amazing, the characters and story lines were top notch and the animation is beautiful. The story and character interactions are the main selling point in this show and I Pray they make another season, The ONLY downfall of this show is that it is SUB only thus far with NO DUB! That is literally the only flaw, I don't usually watch a lot of subbed anime but I'm glad I made an exception for this show and if you see it you will too.",1379030400,5,446,4.137931034482759
8610531,5,B00EZ228NQ,"The anime itself is perfect. i would legitimately give it a 10/10. The Art and animation are beautiful, the characters develop really well and have a lot of depth to them, and it ranges from being happy-go-lucky to being serious and emotional, so you get the best of both worlds. i cannot recommend it enough.

HOWEVER, this release is not for everyone. it doesn't include an english dub, so unless you're a HUGE fan of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojou, i'd highly recommend just watching it on Hulu or Crunchyroll",1424995200,,509,4.655555555555556
8610532,5,B00EZ228NQ,"Pet Girl has become one of my favorite anime in recent memory. It is extremely funny with likeable characters and the animation/art is nothing short of fantastic! The colors, especially, really stand out--bright, vivid, and in-your-face.

A quick synopsis:

After taking in an abandoned cat, Sorata Kanda is exiled to Sakurasou (literally ""Sakura Hall"") of Suimei High School of the Arts. There, he meets a number of interesting classmates...even one that needs a full-time owner!? Enter Mashiro Shiina, whom recently transferred from England. She has always been somewhat removed from society and therefore lacks the necessary skills to take care of her day-to-day necessities--like even picking out her own clothes! Sorata is tasked with ""Mashiro Duty"" and looks after Mashiro throughout the anime.

I was sold on this premise, and, suffice to say, I was as far from disappointed as I could possibly be. The only thing that might put distance between some customers is the amount of fan-service. There's quite a bit as, well... Since Mashiro needs Sorata to, literally, do everything for her. There are many awkward and cute situations that are very funny. Particularly, the Japanese voice actors are SUPERB with their range of expressions and reactions (oh, this anime is not dubbed in English~~~).

Not everything is fun and games, though. Despite it's premise, there are very intricate moments of complex feelings. Each character has a certain goal they are trying to work towards, and there's a constant struggle between working hard and accepting failure while living along side individuals with raw talent. ""Being in such close proximity makes it hard to express these feelings"" (or something like that). By the end, there are actually very good, and important, lessons about having deep friendships and loving one another.

And lastly, I'll comment about one of the things that struck me most: The soundtrack. I don't know if I've ever been more in love with the number of ambient, atmoshperic background pieces that play during exactly the right moments. To give you an idea, I've learned two of these BGMs by ear on the piano and am working on a third one. In some of the scenes, with the art and colors, it's almost surreal.

To wrap things up, I would definitely recommend this anime if you like funny, cute, and a little bit of fan-service. There is a bit of romance... But the protagonists' in particular doesn't really move anywhere (the series of light novels is still ongoing). The more or less serious bits of romance interspersed throughout the 24 episodes is satisfying enough for me, and each of the characters really experience a growth.

Could there be a chance of a second season...? Maybe. The novels are almost finished, and overall great ending that it has could be expanded upon, or it could be left exactly how it is. Either way, you shouldn't be disappointed when it's over (unless you're like me and just want more!).

I hope this helps you in your decision about purchasing ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou"". :)",1406764800,7,3038,4.978303747534516

8610534,4,B00EZ228NQ,"By now, you've already read the other reviewers and probably already have a fairly good idea as to whether or not you would be interested in the Pet Girl of Sakurasou. So, instead of giving my opinion of the anime itself, I'll just give some facts about the actual purchase.

As has been brought up before, there is no dubbed version of the anime at this time. While I personally do not care one way or the other, this fact may turn you off from watching the anime depending on personal preferences. What I believe is much more relevant is the price, which I believe is kind of on the expensive side for only being 12 episodes. If you're not a die-hard fan of the anime to begin with, I would recommend waiting until the anime is bundled with the second season before purchasing it.

I give the Pet Girl of Sakurasou 4 out of 5 stars due to the high quality of the animation, story, and comedic romance bits. It loses a star thanks to a combination of price and lack of features, but otherwise should be picked up whenever you feel the price is right.",1397433600,2,1051,4.32994923857868

8610539,3,B00EZ228NQ,"If you're a fan of subs and hate dubs, then you will love this.

If, like me, you're looking for the English dub version of the anime, you may be disappointed.  This is a Blu-Ray version with the Crunchyroll subtitles.  Great if you just want to watch it offline or support the series, not so much if you were expecting English audio or any sort of extras.

Having said that, Pet Girl of Sakurasou is a masterpiece, and absolutely worth watching.  I still have the second half of the series on pre-order, and if an English dub is ever released, believe that not only will I be buying that, but I'll be giving it a 5-star rating.",1391558400,3,628,4.333333333333333
8610540,3,B00EZ228NQ,"First note, I bought this from right stuff for a much lower price that aside lets get into why I'm giving this such a low rating.

By now I'm sure you've seen numerous other reviews that were thumbed down because they primarily harp on how there is no dub. Well, let me explain this from my perspective and maybe some people will come to an understanding as to why we feel the way we do about it.

First off I watched the first airing of Sakurasou on Crunchyroll in late 2012. I loved the show which is the reason I was so quick to press buy however, this season seems to be one where companies are either lazy or experimenting with their audience. Recently, Funimation released OniAi which was also on my buy list however, right after I pressed the buy button I saw that it was Sub only. Granted the price was right however, a sub only show? Well, upon further research it was clear that funimation could not dub every show they have and thus the less popular ones needed a way to generate more revenue with less cost to the company. The answer was Sub only shows, now I don't mind buying a sub only show, especially if I really like the show (this is why I kept my order of OniAi after finding this out) but for me personally I don't mind waiting a year or two after a show releases to get a wholesome dub with the original audio on the disk.

So as you can tell I sucked it up and went with it, well today in the mail I got Sakurasou and you have to keep in mind this show aired fall of 2012 and was relatively popular in japan. In regards to the streaming numbers I cant tell you but that aside, this product, for it NOT to have a dub and be charged full price is either A) lazy or B) one of the most clever scams I've ever seen. As you know Blu Rays are not region locked like DVDs not to mention US Blu Rays of japanese anime are significantly cheaper than their Japanese counter parts, this means people from all over the world opt to import the US version which usually has both languages and switchable subs. Now what does that mean here?

Sentai.... they released a product a year after the fact without any kind of serious work to it, the show was simulcast on numerous websites, in HD, so subtitles and HD were already a given, they simply took a product and put very little effort into all the little things, like the main menu, or the extras, or anything that goes beyond the initial simulcast. Now lets throw in the import export deal into this, essentially anybody who speaks native Japanese can have half the series for less than the cost of VOLUME 1 (80.00 USD (EP 1-3)) as a Japanese Export/Local Purchase, thus why would anyone buy this product straight from japan when Sentai's is essentially the Japanese product with English subtitles THAT CAN BE TURNED ON OR OFF and its cheaper?

How about this lets use the Movie Ted, Imagine if in america Ted cost you 25 dollars on Blu Ray, now you go online and you find Ted as a Japanese Export for 5 dollars. The audio is still in English, still in Blu Ray, and you can turn the subs on and off. Did you not just buy the american version of Ted for 20 dollars off?

For me, I feel scammed, almost to the point where I won't even bother buying part 2. I don't know what Sentai was going at with this but to me there is no reason this show should not have had an english dub included. Now, I don't know what happened when they were negotiating this deal out, between sentai and the original distributor, but one thing seems to indicate that the original distributor stands to lose in this deal more than anything else, this didn't end up like the persona 4 fiasco with the blu ray only having the english dub, that situation makes some sense this one leads me to believe that Sentai wanted to cash in on this show and its a absolute shame, the show deserves so much better treatment, its actually enjoyable.

but its ok its not like Sentai's going to come back a year or two later and rerelease it WITH AN ENGLISH DUB.......

at this moment in time theres no chance I'll be duped into buying this product twice.

For those of you who prefer to listen to it subbed thats cool but let me ask you this, if you could have the show with one language for $60 dollars OR you could have the same show with two languages on the disk for $60 dollars which one has more value?",1390780800,2,4327,4.247873633049818
