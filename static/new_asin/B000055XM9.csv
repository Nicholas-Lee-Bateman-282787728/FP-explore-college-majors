7931155,4,B000055XM9,"'Marty' in a dirty movie.  Ernest Borgnine had been a favorite actor of mine since I saw him on TV in the movie ""MARTY"", when I read that he had done an 'adult' film, I couldn't wait to see it.  when I finally did see it, I wasn't disappointed, but I remember reading an article given by another of my favorite personalities, where the statement was made, that after awhile, parts for Hollywood actors and actresses dried up, so they went to Europe and appeared in 'adult' films.
""Live by Appointment"" was just such a film.  And Ernest Borgnine was great.",1424822400,,555,4.475247524752476
