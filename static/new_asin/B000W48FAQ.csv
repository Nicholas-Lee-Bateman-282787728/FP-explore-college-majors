8221163,5,B000W48FAQ,"This is an excellent DVD, but apparently not available anymore except from people who bought it years ago. It's Dr. Fuhrman in a lecture and question and answer session given in California years ago, and he's in his usual good form of making it clear what the real Science of Nutrition shows is good for you to eat and what it not good, and why!

The book referred to by people in other reviews, which they have said you should read instead of viewing this is: Eat To Live, which is now out in its second edition, and which went to # 1 on the New York Times Bestseller List in 2011 when it came out. His diet which is usually referred to as the Eat To Live diet (named after the book) is the healthiest diet on Earth, and the original edition had about 1,500 references in it with over 1,000 of them being from peer-reviewed scientific journals, the best possible sources of proven facts. This book (Eat To Live, which is available here on Amazon) is the most scientific source of accurate dietary information available to the lay person, and has more science backing than any other diet ever written about. Most diet books have hundreds or even 1,000 LESS references, esp. scientific references to try to prove what they say it true. Most other diet/lifestyle books are based on a person or doctor coming up with a wacked out theory of their own, then they go look for articles that verify or prove them right. This is not the approach of science. Dr. Fuhrman used a scientific approach, namely, he started with a blank slate back in the 1970's when he wanted to optimize his ability to win in the Olympics, and he wanted to do it in a healthy way, not using steroids and performance boosters that would later damage his health. He read literally tens of thousands of articles since then and has come up with a theory that is based on science and facts, rather than on his personal opinion.

His theory now is basically that foods were designed by nature or evolution or God (depending on your beliefs about that) to perfectly provide us with exactly what our bodies need for optimal health, if only we eat the right ones (which means usually Not processed foods). This DVD and his book go into detail about which ones are the best and he encourages us to eat ""nutrient dense foods,"" which are those with more micronutrients per calorie and which enable our bodies to reverse coronary artery disease, reverse most autoimmune conditions, and prevent most cancers.",1373673600,3,2463,4.570135746606335
8221164,3,B000W48FAQ,"We bought the DVD for $1.95 at a used bookstore. We immediately bought the book which contains a lot more information. The book is a must read for anyone wanting to eat healthy. If the DVD was $9.95, we would have bought several for friends, who would have then bought books. Not a wise marketing decision in my opinion.",1337126400,,320,4.440677966101695
8221165,4,B000W48FAQ,"If you like to read.. the book is great!! If you're not a fan of reading, this DVD is a great backup.  Joel Fuhrman has a great information that everyone should hear, for a healthier longer life, to enjoy family and friends :)",1238630400,13,226,4.255813953488372
8221166,2,B000W48FAQ,"I was so jazzed when I saw this at my library.  I though wow what a treat.  If you want to fall a sleep that is.  I was disappointed, but greatful that I did not pay $$.  The information is valid, the delivery well, not everyone is a gifted teacher.  Or it just takes practice.  Get the book, skip the DVD.  This DVD should be included w/ the book, not something you pay extra for.  I have not read the book, but it probably useful, especially to beginners of good food sense.",1236729600,10,476,4.0978260869565215
