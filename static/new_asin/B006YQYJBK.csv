8506531,1,B006YQYJBK,"This DVD was not made for viewing in the U.S.  I apparently did not see the small print which stated this fact.  The shipping company indicated they would take the product back and refund my purchase price, but only at great expense to themselves.  They also let it be known that they would have no further dealings with me, even though I was very congenial in my emails with them.
So now I'm stuck with a DVD which does not play on my current DVD player.  I will only be able to play it if I purchase an ""all regions"" player.",1346630400,,526,4.178217821782178
