7883262,3,6305121699,"This sillier than usual sword and sandal outing features Jayne Mansfield in a dual role, as a good queen and an evil queen.  Her husband, Mickey Hargitay, is Hercules.

 The usual kinky fun here abounds, as the plot once again involves Hercules falling under the spell of a beautiful but evil woman, and breaking free from her clinging clutches.  Mickey Hargitay is a worse than average Hercules, but all Jayne Mansfield has to do is show up in the peplum standard-issue clinging gown to make this picture worth watching.",984873600,,521,4.820224719101123
