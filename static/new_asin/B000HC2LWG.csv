8138511,4,B000HC2LWG,"We bought this DVD for information on the Maya. It has some information, but much time and attention are given to imagery. Could be more fact-filled.",1488240000,,149,4.769230769230769
8138512,5,B000HC2LWG,This DVD is great.  Jaguars are represented by their spiritual meaning to the different cultures that inhabited central America.,1406851200,,128,5.7368421052631575
8138513,2,B000HC2LWG,"Some nice pictures, but no real information. In 196 minutes, you'd think they could put some real information in there about the Maya ruins, as in their locations, their history, the meanings of the writings, the kings who reigned, etc, but no, just generalities and some pictures, and darned few of those that were very interesting, mostly long blurry transitions with mysterious or pseudo-dramatic music.

I'm planning a trip to Central America and I have to say that this thing was no help at all.",1342483200,2,500,4.882352941176471
8138514,4,B000HC2LWG,"This is a LIFESAVER!

I taped the Aztecs segment off PBS in 1997 and the tape finally started going bad this year in my World History class. The kids always really like this one b/c it's history and nature, so it's more like a Discovery Channel video than a straight-up history video.

It's awesome!",1293148800,,299,4.518518518518518
8138515,5,B000HC2LWG,"This is a beautifully filmed piece on three early Central American cultures, lovely photography, good information in an attractive format.  If you have kids who love animals, get this!  Great intro to regional history.",1229817600,,218,5.382352941176471
8138516,2,B000HC2LWG,"Misleading information, I bought this for the Jaguar title and picture and it is about Mayan Culture, not about jaguars at all. I am extremely disappointed. The information about mayan culture it is ok.",1216944000,4,202,4.970588235294118
8138517,3,B000HC2LWG,THE TITLE AND COVER PHOTO ARE TERRIBLY MIS-LEADING. THIS DVD IS 3+ HOURS ABOUT INCA AND AZTEC AND PRIMITIVE PEOPLES AND THEIR HABITAT...WITH A MINUTE OR TWO OF JAGUAR FOOTAGE THROWN IN. LET ME SAY- ITS VERY IMFORMATIVE AND PROBABLY A GOOD CHOICE TO SHOW CHILDREN TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE AREA AND ITS HISTORY AND PEOPLES. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ANIMAL AT ALL. I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED GIVING THIS 1 STAR- AS I CONSIDER IT A COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION OF THE PICTURE ON THE FRONT AND THE TITLE...BUT THE INFO AND THE OVERALL EDUCATION YOU GET ISNT THAT BAD.,1170460800,22,557,4.58
