8149257,3,B000J5309Y,The cartoons did not hold my six old son's attention.  The animation was fair.  The story line was great.  My recommendation would be for an older child to see for a history lesson.,1340668800,,181,4.424242424242424
8149258,5,B000J5309Y,"First I must let you know that I'm reviewing the Animated Hero Classics series as a whole. The entire collection presents historical figures in a smart and entertaining way, and doesn't pull punches.  Although the NEST website seemed very bible-oriented, the Galileo DVD, for example, was very open about how terribly the church treated Galileo.  And I must mention the music - the theme song was absolutely beautiful.  My almost-seven-year-old son sat through the credits three times just to listen to the music with me.

I'm not sure what the age range for these videos is geared to, but my twin six-year-old-boys love the movies and are, for the most part, willing and able to follow the content.  As with any situation, it helps to stop and discuss certain parts during the movie, but this helps them get more out of the video the next time they watch it.  I can't speak highly enough about these videos; they are truly fantastic. Our favorites are George Washington and Galileo.  Try borrowing one at your local library first, that's how I discovered them!",1292976000,,1061,4.828729281767956
