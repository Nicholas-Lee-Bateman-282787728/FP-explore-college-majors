2171118,5,B000679MJ2,"A series of films designated and designed to be the most disgusting and gruesome films ever made.  And trust this horror fan, they are.  At most times you can honestly see how fake some of the gore is, but at some other times you question why you are watching the sensless maiming and torture of that young girl in the first film.  The production values are completely void of professionalism thus adding to the facade the film is creating.  You are supposed to be watching ""real"" film footage.

This was the film that Charlie Sheen saw and phoned the authorities about thinking it was indeed a real snuff film a few years back.  The stories are void of plots and story structure, but if you are watching these then you know fully well you are not here to watch a deeply involving film about relationships and the sort, rather you are watching these to gross yourself out and to see utter horrors in no ways film has captured until now.

This film series has been banned for sometime in America and other countries as well, I agree with the other reviewer here, get it now before it is discovered and is attempted to be banned.  Next, let's hope Battle Royale is released region 1 so everyone can enjoy the glorious film that is Battle Royale.",1113177600,4,1243,4.493333333333333
2171119,4,B000679MJ2,"Listen up, people: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS UNLESS YOU ARE HIGHLY TOLERANT OF GORE AND REVOLTING IMAGERY. IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN OR THE EASILY OFFENDED, AND EVEN THOSE WHO THINK THEY LIKE THIS SORT OF THING MAY HAVE TROUBLE WATCHING IT. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I submit for your approval the notorious series of Japanese splatter films that is so far beyond the pale that it was actually investigated by several governments. The GUINEA PIG films are, at their best, both disturbing and humorous, and a unique cinematic (videomatic?) experience for those who are game. If this means you, my advice is to hurry up and buy the GUINEA PIG box before some Congressman decides that it should be banned!",1107388800,17,735,4.705426356589148
8039560,5,B000679MJ2,"This is a Gem. I was so chuffed when this arrived. Its so rare to get. The films are so gory and amazing, if you love Japanese horror and gore then defiantly buy this box set. The Limited Edition you get the poster and the T-shirt. But unfortunately the T-shirt was a large and i'm a small so that was downside. but the films are good.",1407369600,,335,4.090909090909091
8039561,5,B000679MJ2,These films consist of nothing other than the most bizarre and repulsive films one can watch with the except of a few others.,1307059200,,125,4.478260869565218
8039562,4,B000679MJ2,"I came across this in Japan in the mid 80's and was taken in immediately by the seemingly real and psychological shock value. If you want to feel uncomfortable while watching A gore fest then this is for you. Some stories are just Gorey and a couple look real enough to make you have Nightmares. ""Twisted"" could be the one word that depicts this the best.",1284681600,,355,4.393939393939394
8039563,3,B000679MJ2,"i thought id seen it all, everything people like Lucio Fulci, Deodato, D'Amato, Miike, and so on had to offer, after watching these, im done.",1204588800,,141,4.68
8039564,2,B000679MJ2,"I really liked the film Flower of Flesh and Blood it has the best special effects on a gore movie, also the snuff vision version on the dvd is an experience. The other movies are interesting, Mermaid in a Manhole is good, but he others are funnier than I expected them to be. The box set is pricey and hard to find, great extras, but try to watch them first before purchasing the set.",1192838400,2,384,4.202702702702703
8039565,5,B000679MJ2,"When the Guinea Pig films came out in Japan in the 1980s, they were big direct-to-video smash hits in Japan, and in 1991, Charlie Sheen mistook FOFAB for a snuff film. Now, They are released.

In this classy four disc set, you get all 6 films (Devil's Experiment, Flower Of Flesh And Blood, He Never Dies!, Mermaid In A Manhole, Android Of Notre Dame, Devil Doctor Woman) plus the ""Making Of Guinea Pig"" documentary (very worth watching) and the ""Slaughter Special"" (on the DVD named ""Guinea Pig's Greatest Moments""), a compilation of all the cool clips from the series. On the FOFAB disc, you even get Hidehi Hino's original FLOWER OF FLESH AND BLOOD manga, and it is very much like the movie. You even get a couple interviews with Hino-san himself.

This is a great box set for splatter fans. If you love gore, buy it!

PS. I found an easter egg on the FOFAB DVD! select ""Flower Of Flesh And Blood"" On the DVD menu, then once the menu with the lips appears, press down to highlight a tiny splatter, then press enter...then sit back and enjoy FOFAB in ""snuff vision""!",1161043200,3,1068,4.523316062176166
8039566,2,B000679MJ2,"I cant beleve I done it again. I spent my money on anothe movie because of the reviews. Well first of I don't know what all these other people are talking about, the whole set was a bore. Yes there was gore and a few moments that were ok. But for the most part it was a waste of mone. I had rather watch PEE-WEE than this crap. ***********DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY*********",1156982400,5,369,4.138888888888889
8039567,5,B000679MJ2,"Needles to say this series of films is very graphic and extreme, although entertaining in a morbid way of its own. The effects are realistic and extrodinary for being older films and the ambience really makes for an unnerving movie expierience. If you like extreme, then buy this, you will not be dissapointed.",1153353600,3,310,4.867924528301887
8039568,5,B000679MJ2,"I bought this New from Amazon for $80.00 and felt it was worth every penny. There are no other DVDs like these 4. Each DVD is very different. I could not watch more than one at a time...too intense. You are NOT a True fan of Horror/Cult films unless you see the Guinea Pig Set. This would never have been made in the USA. I read some of the other reviews.  There are also Zombies, Talking Heads, Weird Genitals, talking Poop, etc.  The makeup and special effects are far better than any of the ""Living Dead"" George Romero films. The Japanese element is a definite plus and gives it some comic relief and the Extras and behind the scenes footage shows that the actors/actresses had alot of fun doing these Films. Plotwise these are at least as good as 3/4 of the Masters of Horrors Showtime Series. Buy it before it becomes unavailiable or the USA Bans these DVDs!",1140393600,9,863,4.421383647798742
8039569,5,B000679MJ2,"This is one of those movies that, if you describe to your friends, they'll either say kick-ass, pop-it-in! Or take out their cell and dial 911. Either way, they'll most likely run away screaming. Personaly I didn't think they were as violent as people make them out to be, but one thing is certain, this sure as s*** aint gumby. In fact the only possible way you could connect these with something along the lines of gumby, is how the titles essentially tell you exactly whats going to happen, ""trapped on the moon"" means gumby's gonna be on the moon this episode, and ""Flower of flesh and blood"" means someones gonna die. These movies are all only 40-50 some minutes long, but they are basicly gaurenteed to make you cringe. These films have been frequently banned and frowned upon, and even hailed as genius over the past 15 years, some people have even been sued for owning copies of these on vhs. Here's a basic run down on the movies in the set:

""Devil Doctor Woman"": by far the most comedic of the films, and also the tamest, based on a woman who heads the underground surgical movement in Japan, the whole movie is based around the various strange and humorous deseases which she must cure...for good. It begins with a family of people with the same desease, I would tell you what it is, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. a pretty cool movie over all, and a nice intro to the series if you don't want to go in full force with ""flesh and blood"" but I think the zombi part dragged on a little.

""Android of Notre Dame"": the make up in this isn't quite as impressive as some of the other films, but the monolouges in the beggining and end are brilliant. The plot involves a scientist who is intent on discovering the missing link to life, and a cure for death, so that his sister may survive her deadly heart desease, he begins by experimentiing on animals, but when he recieves a mysterious phone call from a man named Kato, he is forced to use less ""humane"" methods.

""Mermaid in a manhole"": a painter who is still grief stricken by the loss of his wife searches for inspiration in a sewer, which was once a beautiful river he played in as a child. And one day he sees a mermaid which he has met in the river when he was younger, and has since both haunted and inspired him, but he soon discovers that she is injured and diseased. Soon after, his neighbors become worried after seeing strange things outside his apartment.

""He Never Dies"": Another example of the title telling all. This story follows a depressed man, fed up with pushing papers in his office, he decides to stop going to work. After running low on ideas on what to do, he begins fiddling with a pocketknife and eventually slits his wrist[this is where one of my favorite movie lines comes in""oh my god I just slit my wrist!"" he quickly notices the blood stop flowing, confused, he decides to cut deeper,and deep, and deeper. he soon recognizes that he is ""the man who cannot die"" and decides to have a little fun with that fact. the sitcom-esque ending is brilliantly erreverent.

""Devil's Experiment"": I'm pretty sure this is the one Charlie Sheen called the feds after seeing. also I heard of a man in Japan who re-enacted some of the scenes in this, only on real people. I think they could have given it a more realistic feel by not useing so many different camera angles. This film was marketed as being an actual home recorded film which was supposedly intended to test the breaking points of one woman as three men hit her, kicked her, and from there on, I don't want to ruin anything for you. The real haunting features in this film are

1.)the fact that every sequence continues longer and longer until you just want to scream for the poor woman.

and 2.) the shot of the woman unconcious hanging in the net in the forest is probably the most disturbing image in the whole series.

""Flower of Flesh and Blood"": This is it. This is the one You've heard so much about. A Japanese Manga writer[I think his name was Hideshi Hino] recieved a unmarked parcel in the mail, the contents? 1 8mm film, 54 still photos, and a 19 page letter of explanation saying that a horrible crime had been commited in a very secret place. The man watched the film and saw a woman being tortured in a horrible and violent way. he quickly handed the contents of the letter to the police and, haunted by what he saw, he decided to make a semi-documentary/re-make of what was on the film he recieved. Hailed world wide as the most horrendous movie ever made, ""Flower"" is one of the most intense shock-cinema films of all time.",1117411200,40,4588,4.440617577197149
