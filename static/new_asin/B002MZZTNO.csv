3953231,4,B002MZZTNO,"Glad I found this.  Took me back decades.  Fun to watch.  As a movie, its pretty cheesy...but hey, what do you expect??  Suspend reality or any expectations and enjoy the ride.  Life is short.",1359763200,2,192,4.529411764705882
3953232,5,B002MZZTNO,"I last saw this movie when I was little kid I cried when giant robot died I would always watch the movie when it came on T.V.I really like the film I wanted to buy the film back then but I could never find it. I first saw the movie in the late 60,s or early70,s I recommend this movie to other sci-fi enthusiast",1300406400,5,311,3.875
3953233,2,B002MZZTNO,"Okay, I don't know if this is an illegal copy or not.  I suppose it depends on if the film is in public domain or not.

Regardless, this was recorded using a Panasonic DVD recorder (I recognize the menu).  I assume it's been copied from an old VHS copy.

It's watchable, but the quality is comparable to an old, overused VHS tape.",1270339200,9,330,4.274193548387097
3953234,1,B002MZZTNO,"Wow. I wasn't expecting high quality (it is a DVD-R after all), but this is awful!
If I'm paying for a movie, why do I have to see a little ""S C"" on the screen. During the opening, the letters ""S C"" appear on the lower right of the screen. Even worse, the letters reappear and stay on the screen for a good part of the movie. These letters are not exactly out of the way either--at times they are actually over the actors themselves. The ""S C"" stands for Sinister Cinema I guess. I'll be sure not to buy any of their products again. Also, the picture shakes vertically at times and is quite bad overall.

I assume most people interested in this movie saw it when they were younger and have fond memories of it. It is the story of ""Giant Robot"" and Johnny Sokko, the boy who controls him by speaking into a watch. Even if you're desperate to see this again, look for a better quality version.",1257120000,21,891,4.2105263157894735
3953235,4,B002MZZTNO,ok I'm a kid again when I watch these my kids are like whatever...so its an adult thing I guess,1445472000,,95,3.8
3953236,1,B002MZZTNO,Picture quality and color was terrible!,1444867200,,39,5.666666666666667
3953237,5,B002MZZTNO,Johnny's greatest hits.....too funny,1436486400,,36,8.25
3953238,4,B002MZZTNO,"The quality was better than I expected.  From the reviews I thought it was a complete waste to buy.  But, I was pleasantly surprised.",1427932800,2,133,4.5
3953239,1,B002MZZTNO,"This is a DVD-R not even a real DVD. I intend to ask Amazon if this is even a legal copy, Will be returning. My guess is that it is a bootleg copy and I am amazed that Amazon is selling these. If you are expecting a quality copy don't bother with this. We should expect better from Amazon.",1404345600,,289,3.9152542372881354
3953240,5,B002MZZTNO,A childhood movie that I don't mind the fact that it was cheezy.  Movie quality was not bad considering it was 1970's on DVD! Sweet!,1399334400,,132,4.28
3953241,1,B002MZZTNO,"Ok, short and sweet, HORRIBLE VHS to DVD-R copy and on top of this mess the movie is tagged throughout with ""SC"" for Sinister Cinema. What's wrong with you sinister cinema? I wouldn't lay claim to this LOUSY copy at all, even a free copy is to much. Your production of this classic flick is a slap in the face. I will never buy another production from you EVER.",1399248000,2,361,4.246376811594203
3953242,2,B002MZZTNO,"If you grew up watching this movie over and over on channel 5 in the Los Angeles area - this will take you back.

However, the video/audio quality is so bad.  The audio is a couple of seconds behind the audio - annoying.

If you can get your copy from a different source - do it.  This one was not good quality.",1397692800,3,311,3.967741935483871
3953243,3,B002MZZTNO,"It looks like a bootleg in the beginning but I enjoyed the movie very much.
Go Giant Robot you are tall.",1385683200,,104,4.0
3953244,5,B002MZZTNO,"The first time I saw this movie was back around 1976. It played for 5 nights in a row on channel 5 KTLA.
I loved it then and still do. We called him ""Giant Robot""",1377216000,,162,3.657142857142857
8374453,5,B002MZZTNO,Love this movie as a kid. Still love it thanks for sending it so quickly.,1528329600,,73,3.933333333333333
8374454,5,B002MZZTNO,Great movie!!! I remember watching this as a kid in the 1970's!!! Enjoyed it again 40yrs later!!!,1522022400,,97,4.764705882352941
8374455,5,B002MZZTNO,Thank you.,1497916800,,10,4.5
8374456,3,B002MZZTNO,"Good movie.  I just think the quality wasn't all that great.  It's amazing what software can do to restore old film.  They should've used it on such a cult classic such as this one.  I've seen old 1930's movies restored to such clarity and the sound is amazing.  But, I understand that sometimes it depends on what material is available.  But, still, they could've worked a little harder to make this one a great presentation.",1497052800,,426,4.613333333333333
8374457,4,B002MZZTNO,"Not the best quality, but very nice to own a copy... finally! I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Voyage Into Space. The video is grainy, but I already knew it would be that way after having read comments by others before my purchase.",1489104000,,243,4.191489361702128
8374458,2,B002MZZTNO,"I am so disappointed by the quality of the video. There is no way this was mastered from any of the original film or video tape. Whomever mastered this for digital should be tossed out. Truly awful work.
When I was a little kid, we always looked forward to when this movie would come around. It is pure campy Japanese Sci-Fi. The story is not bad but if you keep a really good sense of humor about Japanese Sci-Fi, you will enjoy this movie. I just wish the quality of the digital master was even reasonably good.",1485820800,,513,4.298969072164948
8374459,4,B002MZZTNO,I watch this show on Comet TV so I was happy to see the movie. Campy fun!,1485388800,,73,3.3529411764705883
8374460,5,B002MZZTNO,I use to watch this movie as a kid even though tis a copy its still good,1471824000,,72,3.2941176470588234
8374461,5,B002MZZTNO,"Yes, the picture quality is less than perfect, but a pristine print of this rare film does not exist. Voyage Into Space is cheesy fun, and Sinister Cinema is to be praised for preserving it. Know going in: This film contains giant rubber monsters who smash toy tanks, secret agencies with names like Unicorn and Gargoyle, an evil space alien named Emperor Guillotine and a giant robot controlled by a boy who communicates with it through a Dick Tracy like wristwatch. And that's just for starters. This film ain't Citizen Kane, nor does it pretend to be. It's for fans of weird, obscure, but mostly cheesy movies.",1465257600,3,613,4.738317757009346
