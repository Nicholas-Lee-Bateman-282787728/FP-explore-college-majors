8265687,5,B0017CW5QC,Brain donors is awesome.  If you Like marx brothers movies you will like this.  Critical condition is ok.  It's Richard prior so there are some funny parts.  Not his best work though.,1401062400,,183,4.625
8265688,5,B0017CW5QC,"To be honest, I bought this movie only for Brain Donors.  It was worth the money, If you like zany, Three Stooges-type, and Marx Brothers-type comedy, I highly recommend it.  You'll laugh yourself crazy!",1387065600,,203,4.9411764705882355
8265689,5,B0017CW5QC,I enjoyed this comedy immensely. The cast was superb in their comedic portrayals reminiscent of the Marx Brothers. I recommend it.,1344816000,,130,5.238095238095238

For all the time I have had this movie, I still have not watched Critical Condition! I guess it's an ok movie, though I bought the disc for Brain Donors anyway. This double feature was cheaper at the time than the DVD of just Brain Donors, so I ordered this instead.
Brain Donors stars in the lead roles John Turturro, Mel Smith, and Bob Nelson. Turturro is probably best known today for his roles in the three Transformers movies.

There is literally an ambulance chasing lawyer named Flakfizer (John Turturro) and is called upon by his client Lillian Ogelthorpe to help settle affairs with her estate after he husband dies.  To arrive at Lillian's house after being summoned he meets and shares a cab with Lillian's employee Jacques (Bob Nelson).  The cab driver Rocco (Mel Smith), whom later becomes an employee of Flakfizer's along with Jacques arrive at the Oglethorpe estate and the craziness ensues.  Much to the dismay of another attorney also employed by Lillian Ogelthorpe, Edmund Lazlo (John Savident) Lillian hires Flakfizer to run a Ballet Company along with Lazlo.

Lazlo is a serious, business minded lawyer as compared to Flakfizer that cannot do anything without either acting outrageous or concocting some type of scheme.  Flakfizer is unsuccessful in his attempts to attract the ballet dancer ""The Great Volare"" (George De La Pena) to the new ballet company, instead pursuing a lesser known dancer.  Lazlo however is successful at hiring Volare and the reactions and schemes and silliness goes to another hilarious level.  The movie is more and more outrageously funny as it goes along, never making any attempts at any kind of a meaningful plot.

I really loved how the movie was a journey, a discovery, an experience of the situations all of the characters found themselves in....and it was fun to watch.  One other great thing I loved about the movie is that I forgot I was actually watching a movie and I felt I was seeing a story unfold.

The ending scenes are full of slapstick, silliness and also a satisfaction that even though you had no idea how it was going to end - it works out like you knew it would.  That's my take....don't want to say too much about it...in case you have not seen it just yet.  To see Falkfizer going up against Lazlo and all the silliness that is following.....it's great!  I wish there could have been a sequel.....this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!

The line ....""A likely story""..... is my favorite. You have to see the movie to appreciate it. While the movie may be about a ballet company, this movie is far from artistic.  It is more of a silly, slapstick kind of movie that just happens to have elements of Ballet in the movie.",1313712000,,2718,4.688421052631579
8265691,3,B0017CW5QC,"I will say this is an interesting paring.  The films aren't that great but I wouldn't categorize it as uninteresting.  I would say neither film is a failure but both fall short of their intended mark.  ""Brain Donors"" is a make-no-bones-about-it homage to the Marx Brothers that doesn't live up to it's lofty intentions.  Director Dennis Dugan gets the nuts and bolts of the Fab Three down pat but fails to capture the essence and the spirit that make the Marx Brothers timeless.  John Turturro, however, aquits himself well by suggesting Groucho in his performance but there's enough original riffs to separate him from the Master.  Bob Nelson and Mel Smith are another story.  Their performances are lifeless.  Harpo and Chico, they wish.  They would be more at home aspiring to be Zeppo and Gummo.  I viewed ""Critical Condition"" with a little bit of malaise.  Richard Pryor was such an extremely talented guy but Hollywood didn't know what to do with him.  He does a nice turn here balancing the comic and dramatic elements of the script.  Alas, it's the same script that lets him down.  The film doesn't know whether it's a raucous comedy or heavy hospital drama.  Since these elements awkwardly comingle we are left with an unsatisfied feeling.",1302998400,,1248,4.848341232227488
8265692,5,B0017CW5QC,"I will admit I only got this 2pack DVD because of Brain Donors.

I used to see the VHS all the time in my local Blockbuster and finaly decided to look it up on Wikipedia, found out it was (loosely) based on a Marx Brothers movie, checked some clips out on YouTube and was soled.

The Zucker Brothers are perfect for the Marx Bros. style of comedy and they pull off updating it VERY well.
IMO even though it's PG I think it is too adult at times for a ""Marx Bros."" film.
Still I wish they would have made more films with this cast.

John Turturro Pulls of the Groucho-esque attitude brilliantly, his line delivery and timing are right on par.
Mel Smith and Bob Nelson where great in the rolls of Chico and Harpo (respectively).
Bob Nelson does talk, but not that much. He is a good physical comedian for the roll.

All in all if you like the Marx Brothers get this film.

Oh about Critical Condition... it's rated R and I don't plan on watching it.",1297036800,,947,4.238888888888889
8265693,5,B0017CW5QC,"I only purchased this b/c it was cheaper to buy the double feature than it was just to buy ""Brain Donors.""  Brian Donors was $40 just by itself.  I guess that means that Critical Condition is actually worth negative dollars?  If you love the Marx Bros, you will love Brain Donors!  What a great movie!",1295654400,,301,4.418181818181818
8265694,5,B0017CW5QC,"This one is a classic.  The three actors will have you laughing constantly.  You can tell that they had fun making this movie.

As for critical condition, not so great.  I chuckled a few times but it was all just based off of one joke really.",1276646400,,242,4.195652173913044
8265695,1,B0017CW5QC,"The movie?  I have no idea what the movie is like.  The company, IMPORT CD's, sent me the wrong movie.  I never watched the movie.  I did not open it.  I sent the WRONG movie back to the address that they listed.  I have NOT been refunded my original money.  Not happy with IMPORT CD's. Don't plan on ordering from them again, ever.
