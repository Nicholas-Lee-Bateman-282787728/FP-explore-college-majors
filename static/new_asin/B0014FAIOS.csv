Aside from that, interesting plot, some daring effects without CGI (that will make you jump abit toward the end). Over all not the worse movie I have seen, it is worth it, to poke fun at and for the gore fest at the end. I must say, not too much gore and no clothes completely taken off (which is rare in modern horror, which is not bad either) perfect mix not to little, not to much.

I would only suggest as rental only, but at least watch it once, and only if you have a horror film craving. (this is not movie watching at it's best). But will satisfy a horror fans taste

This was a guilty pleasure, I don't watch too much horror anymore, I like mainly the horror involving creatures and the supernatural.

This movie is mainly for those who want a fun campy, semi gore fest.

3131567,3,B0014FAIOS,"2008's ""Grizzly Park"" piqued my interest because I liked the trailer (see it on IMDb) and it was shot near the Mt. Rogers region in SW Virginia & NE Tennessee (Marion, VA, and Backbone Rock Recreation Area, TN), which is one of the places I vacationed last summer.

THE PLOT: Eight delinquent youths from the city are assigned community service at Grizzly Park, CA, chaperoned by no-nonsense Ranger Bob. What they don't know is that there's an escaped killer on the loose, as well as a killer grizzly!

The movie starts out great with a quote of 2 Kings 2:23-25, which refers to the occasion where a bunch of youths jeered the prophet Elisha and his baldness. When he couldn't take it any more, Elisha cursed them and two bears came out of the forest, mauling 42 kids. The following opening credits sequence is creative and well done, the music too. At this point I was wondering if I may have stumbled upon a hidden gem, like ""Sasquatch Mountain"" and (much less so) ""Flu Birds,"" entertaining Grade-B creature-features that shoot for more depth than the norm (see my review of each). From there, however, the film derails into serious C-Grade territory with bad dialogue, a mildly campy approach, lousy pacing and no suspense. Fortunately the film makes up for it in the last act, the final 30 minutes or so, which is a killer grizzly gorefest, but you have to slog through a semi-uneventful first hour to get there.

Despite the negative comments there are a handful of positive points:

- Gorgeous late Summer/early Fall locations in SW Virginia & NE Tennessee; although the story takes place in California.
- A good cast of women: a brunette, a blond, a Hispanic and an Asian. The brunette, Bebe (Emily Foxler), struck me as a likable character who unlocked my compassion and favor despite being a seemingly total airhead (until the end, that is, which ruined it; you'll know what I mean when you see it). The Hispanic girl, Lola (Zulay Henao), is the real beauty here and the viewer is treated to some quality eyecandy.
- One white dude, Scab (Randy Wayne), turns out to be slightly likable, even though he's supposedly a hardcore ""white power"" rascist. His indoctrination is shattered, however, when he discovers himself falling for the Hispanic Lola, which gives indication that he's actually a very smart young man. This leads to a beautiful and touching scene between the two. I wasn't expecting this in a Grade-C campy gorefest.
- There's no CGI. The bear is real, except for a couple parts where there's a human stand-in.
- Like I said, the last act features some hardcore gore, like one of the girls being bit in half with her entrails laying loose, heads getting bit in half, etc. I don't watch these types of movies for the gore, but some like it. The only thing is, although the gore is very extreme in the last 25 minutes I didn't find it shocking or scary at all; in fact, sometimes I just busted out laughing, but that's mainly because of the campy tone more than anything. In other words, since the filmmakers deliver the goods in a semi-serious this-is-all-a-joke manner I couldn't very well take the shocks & gore serious. Yet this doesn't mean it's not entertaining.
- The old campfire classic ""I Met a Bear"" is utilized a couple times during the movie and fully during the end credits, performed here by Twin Sisters .

For those who argue that the murderer subplot seemed totally pointless: It's more than just a red herring and ties into the media's theory for the so-called murders revealed at the end, a doofy bear costume being a chief piece of evidence.

The dvd features a handful of ""making of"" extras with cast and crew, including the 1300 lb. bear, Brody; each one is only a few minutes in length. You'll marvel at how close the trainer and other crewmembers get to the bear. I'm glad each segment is short because I only prefer the gist of it; I don't care to see a friggin' movie on the making of the movie, if you know what I mean; unless of course it's something like ""Apocalypse Now.""

BOTTOM LINE: Despite being a semi-campy Grade-C film with a fairly uneventful first hour and some bad writing, pacing, etc., ""Grizzly Park"" possesses a curious 'cult' ambiance highlighted by a great opening credits sequence (big deal, huh?) and a violently gorey climax. I like the women (Lola!), the real bear, no CGI, the campfire classic ""I Met a Bear"" and the gorgeous Eastern locations, plus there's at least one touching, nigh reverent romantic scene, no kidding.

Part of me wants to rate this 4/5 Stars since, in many ways, ""Grizzly Park"" delivers the goods, but I'd feel too guilty because this isn't really a good movie. It's equal parts boring, dumb, eccentric, fun, inept, impressive and fascinating. A guilty pleasure that will likely develop a small cult following who'll openly admit it's not good, but like it anyway (sort of).

3131572,1,B0014FAIOS,"Grizzly Park (Tom Skull, 2008)

First time writer-director Tom Skull somehow managed to convince some very high-powered folks to back this dog (or should I say bear?) of a movie, which aims to combine a slasher flick and a nature-gone-wild flick and comes up with something that takes the worst bits of each and combines them into an unwatchable stew of incoherence and stupidity that you'd have to be a masochist to watch all the way through. I know. I'm a masochist.

In Grizzly Park, we have a bunch of juvenile delinquents and a few cops to herd them, along with a park ranger and a killer grizzly, all in a secluded place. Do I need to tell you anything more about the plot here?

It wouldn't be too bad if there were a decent script, some good acting, decent pacing, or even a really awesome special effect or two. (Okay, I lie. There is one really, really awesome special effect that shows up almost at the end of the movie.) The movie contains none of this. The pacing is the film's worst feature; to oversimplify things a bit, nothing happens for seventy of the movie's ninety minutes, and then all the sudden, wham, killer grizzly attack. But right behind it is the script. There's some attempt at trying to get to know these characters, and I guess Skull should be given some points for that, but once we get to where there's supposed to be tension, the script falls apart entirely. To call it incoherent would be doing a grave injustice to drunken madmen everywhere. As for the acting, well, I may have seen worse in a movie recently, but I can't remember where. And this is a movie where most of the actors should just need to stand around and scream and look pretty.

I am not a fan of this type of movie, but watched it and was impressed with the bear and the fact that no CGI had to be used in its scenes. Personally, I'd rather see the real thing than something someone dreamed up on a computer.

Good, clean fun - I know it's not something that many teenagers do, but they should give it a try!",1221004800,3,863,4.070588235294117

8255491,5,B0014FAIOS,"The movie Grizzly Park,wow I thought I could always figure out a movie. But this one. Is incredible...A bunch of kids in trouble with there self's.and in life in general...Is sent to this ranger place in the woods to do community service...To talk about there troubles. To get better..And to get therapy..Turns out they are a killer Grizzly Bear on the loose as well in the woods...That kills everybody...And the one in charge the one who runs the place. Turns out to be 1 with the killer bear...They are some gross bloody scenes..And very Gory as well. The Bear looks like the same bear that was on Grizzly Adams...As Gentle Ben. The movie is good.low cussing,some sexual content as well....For my part they could have left the cussing,and the nudity out....",1439164800,,759,4.801526717557252
8255492,5,B0014FAIOS,"The reason i give this film 5 stars is because the scenery is so spectacular & beautiful. Set in the woods a group of kids are being sent to this reform program for youth offenders & downright mischiefous teens. At the same time they're is a prisoner that breaks out of a prison and is on the run. The con kills a forrest ranger and uses his clothes and van to infiltrate this
 forrest compound to hide out. Little does he know that ranger
Bob is an elite ranger who is set to take a bunch of offenders out to hopefully learn from the experience and grow up a bit,but not even ranger Bob is who he seems to be. The forrest ranger tells them that there are wolves and bears out to gorge for the time being so they are nice and full before hibernation. The kids claim to know what they are doing and they run off the trails and run astray through the park. The kids get caught up in traps,eaten by wolves and eventually eaten by a bear. They get left alone when ranger Bob runs off to find out where 2 of the youths disappear too,leaving them alone to be eaten by the bear. The convict gets eaten as well and this 1 kid gets the bright idea to bring a bear costume to scare the girls. The twist is at the end,when the murders are blamed on the serial killer convict who escaped and ""used the bear outfit to kill"" yet ranger Bob is left with the bear,the 1 bear that has been doing the eating. Ranger Bob is the  guy who pretty much acts as the shepard guiding them along the way to the path of cleanliness. The guy is giving them a chance to straighten out or be eaten by his best buddy the big bear. Since their are no bears in the park supposedly,the deaths were all ruled as murders by the escaped con. This movie has such beautiful scenary and a very cool story with great twists. A great animal based horror movie. I am not big on animal horror movies because they usually suck with bad acting and CGI but not here this has a real live bear that is inches away from the actors. The actual bear handler is the con(in real life,not the script) Beautiful scenary and beautiful girls and a killer,bloody good film. Definitely worth the watch,a must own for horror fans.",1427760000,,2168,4.209134615384615
8255493,5,B0014FAIOS,So happy to have found this!  A+++,1415404800,,34,3.857142857142857
8255494,4,B0014FAIOS,"I like this movie because the bad teens who are in the forrest to serve sentences for their gross and horrendous misbehavior are punished further than the law had in mind. The teens are all good looking, are from all stations in life, and seem to be lacking conscienses. The best part of this movie is the last 10 minutes when ... I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. SciFi channel airs this movie or you can buy it here. You'll like the theme song and the story twist. This movie isn't for everyone, but I like it.",1364860800,3,534,4.194174757281553
8255495,3,B0014FAIOS,Okay so I watched this on Netflix the horror really only starts the last 10 mins and on top of the the effects are kinda bad and the movie woulda been better if it was just the kids messing around. So why 3 stars because it had a really good start then it becam stupid when the bear came in to eat people but was it bad no the effects is what made it bad and I woulda liked it bette if it was just a movie bout why the kids were there it jus kinda worked better,1350086400,,461,3.7142857142857144
8255496,5,B0014FAIOS,"Great movie, I loved it. I noticed another comment that said ""bad special effects,"" that is incorrect. There are no special effects and that is just one of the beauties of this film. Great concept some of the acting could of been better, but then again it worked (juveniles) Also will there be a plot twist or will it end straight forward? Is it predictable, idk? Again, cool movie with a (traped in the woods and chased by a real beast) feel!",1349913600,,443,4.414634146341464
8255497,3,B0014FAIOS,"In my opinion, The movie is good, but it needs alot of work. I do get the story idea, but it doesn't make alot of sense. The Special effects, some of them are just not believeable. ""The Walking Dead"" had alot more believeable effects on their shows than ""Grizzly Park"". But there are some funny moments in this movie. I did like the twist and turns like the serial killer being there and the kids emotions toward each other, but it doesn't have the same feeling as movies like ""The Ruins"", and ""I Am Legend"".If they had changed the storyline just a little bit, maybe they would have a better rating.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly-Park/dp/B0014FAIOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly Park</a>&nbsp;So In Conclusion, This movie is good, but not great.

8255498,3,B0014FAIOS,"I don't think the critics get it. This is a dark comedy. Sometimes critics don't get dark comedies, and I think that is the case here because I found it fun to watch. A group of teenagers must go on a park cleanup to repay for their crimes ranging from computer hacking to manslaughter. Who would guess a murderer is posing as one of the park staff and killing off people. If that isn't bad enough there is a killer grizzly bear rampaging through the park. The cast does a pretty good job and their are a couple you should recognize. The writing and directing are good. The story is different and original. The special effects and the editing are fairly decent. At least rent it like I did, and if you enjoy dark comedies I think you will like it.
