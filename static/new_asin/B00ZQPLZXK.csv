7289043,5,B00ZQPLZXK,A good workout that is adaptable to participant's ability - and fun to boot!,1444953600,2,76,4.5
7289044,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Luv if,1442275200,,6,2.5
7289045,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"Fun, nontraditional workout. The workouts on this DVD are alot of fun. The kids and I can all do them together and they enjoy it as do I. It is a great workout plan for those that have a hard time standing long enough for a workout. There is a variety of dancing styles that are all transformed to being able to be done in the seat. I would highly recommend these to senior citizens, people with join problems, new or returning exercisers or anyone looking for a little variety to their workout!

*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1440374400,10,569,4.367924528301887
7289046,2,B00ZQPLZXK,"I was very disappointed in this DVD.  It does not have menu where you can choose to select a certain section of the video, and the list of tunes is so tiny that I cannot read them.  The woman on the video goes too fast for me.  About the only good thing I can say about this DVD workout is that the music was nice, and the disk was pretty.",1440115200,9,339,3.8142857142857145
7289047,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Did the exercise routine today & very much liked it. I did most of it standing up to increase the intensity. I love that it can be done standing or sitting & still get a nice workout. Increased my heart rate & got me moving around well. I liked learning the dance moves & steps. I enjoyed the music as well. I will be doing this workout again as I needed something different to do for a workout. I received the CD free in exchange for my unbiased review. Thanks for this fun CD!,1438473600,11,478,4.095744680851064
7289048,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"Fun low impact workout! Easy to follow along, great instruction from Gina and good choreography to get you moving. Will definitely recommend this DVD. Thank you for creating this type of workout!",1438128000,3,195,5.125
7289049,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"As someone who has Psoriatic Arthritis it is sometimes difficult to find an exercise regime that will not cause strain on joints. Which is detrimental for someone with autoimmune arthritis. Then I was introduced to Smile and Sway. It is a wonderful safe way for me to stay active and not worry about hurting myself.  Who would think that it could be so much fun?! The songs have you humming along. There is no way you could sit still lol. I was going to review the CD to see the moves before actually attempting them but it was so much fun I couldn't resist. Easy to learn I jumped right in and was able to follow along with ease. It felt great!  It's a must have. It really is a workout that is fun, easy and safe.  Its for ALL ages.  So grab your chair everyone!",1436918400,3,764,4.212328767123288
7289050,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"My grandmother LOVES this DVD! I am a nurse who takes care of my grandmother at home, and I am always looking for activities to inspire her to get up and move. I was a ballroom dancer for many years, and she has always enjoyed watching me on the sidelines. This DVD allowed her to participate and do some moves that she has watched me do for so many years. The instructor is full of fun energy, and the other participants are very inspiring. The moves are easy to follow, and my grandmother couldn't stop smiling. Definitely recommend this, would make a great gift for any grandparent.",1435622400,3,585,4.4766355140186915
7289051,4,B00ZQPLZXK,"Not recommended for all seniors as it requires average to above average flexibility.  I do the warm up and then select one or two dance sessions.  Once I am able to do these with relative ease, I will add more until I can do the entire DVD at one sitting.",1490572800,,255,4.08
7289052,3,B00ZQPLZXK,"As an Activity Director, I bought this DVD for my seniors. Although I thought it was fun to move to the music, everyone had a difficult time keeping up with it. I think this is geared for a slightly younger crowd.",1487635200,,213,4.219512195121951
7289053,5,B00ZQPLZXK,I love this upbeat sitting workout video. I have bad knees and needed to find something fun to do sitting down. The music and production itself is motivating. I am about 60 lbs over weight in my 50s and needed to move. I took a chance buying this and haven't been more pleased. I want to buy more from Gina but can't find any more of her dad's on amazon. Bring them On! I'll buy them for more variety.,1486512000,,401,4.0886075949367084

7289055,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"Outstanding DVD! The dance moves are easy to follow and a real workout for someone who has not exercised in a long time. I gave my Zumba dvds to my daughter and I am right at home with Smile & Sway. Fun and exercise are not normally in the same sentence for me but this DVD has changed that as I tango, cha cha, and paso doble myself into fitness. Keep up the good work.",1480809600,6,370,3.9466666666666668
7289056,5,B00ZQPLZXK,We started using it immediately,1476662400,,31,5.4
7289057,5,B00ZQPLZXK,This is a fun way to work out.  Just because you sit in a chair doesn't mean you don't get a full body workout.  I look forward to this workout and wish they had more like it,1475971200,,174,3.675675675675676
7289058,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Great idea for those who want to exercise but cannot do it the normal way.  Keeps from getting bored while you are exercising.  I would higly recommend!,1472083200,,152,4.592592592592593
7289059,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Love the exercise and the music.  Can either do it sitting or standing depending on one's health condition.,1471910400,,107,4.944444444444445

7289061,1,B00ZQPLZXK,doesn't make me smile - pretty awful actually - the music is louder than the instructor's voice - poorly done,1470787200,2,109,4.5
7289062,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Love this workout.  I have had to stay off one foot for 10 weeks and this has been amazing.  Wish she would do another one.  It is actually fun,1469318400,2,143,3.8620689655172415
7289063,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"I bought this for my husband as he cannot be on his feet long due to a medical condition.  He really enjoys doing it.  He said he likes the music, it's easy to follow , and that there is also a man on the DVD.  We would definitely purchase more of your DVD's (I also bought Dance that Walk- VERY FUN!).  When I see more of your DVD's like these 2- I will purchase them).",1466380800,3,370,3.8933333333333335

7289066,3,B00ZQPLZXK,"Although the music is great and our seniors may stay seated through it, most of the songs with accompanying hand movements were a little too fast and intricate for our seniors (most are in their 70's and 80's). We have been able to single out a few slower selections, but have not tried them as yet.",1463529600,,299,4.357142857142857
7289067,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"I'm so happy I bought this DVD! I wanted to try a safe and dynamic exercise video with my patients and Smile and Sway is just that! We tried it for the first time yesterday and found it to be fun, energizing, and surprisingly, a great seated workout. It reminded me of a seated Zumba routine and both the patients (adults), nursing students, and I felt the sweat while we had a seated dance party. Try it out!",1463270400,7,409,4.256410256410256

7289071,3,B00ZQPLZXK,I can't really rate this as it was not bought for my personal use.  Sorry.,1461196800,,74,3.933333333333333

7289078,4,B00ZQPLZXK,"Love the exercises and music. However, the quality of the DVD isn't very good. Most of the selections have a small defect which causes a short disruption of the exercise.",1446508800,10,170,4.7
7289079,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Bought this for my 84 year old mother. She likes it and I like doing it with her! It's fun and a good workout for her. She enjoys the music used.,1445904000,9,145,3.7096774193548385

8720658,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"I bought this for my mom who recently suffered a major stroke.  This video has been super helpful for her to do rehabilitating type of moves on her own.  She loved to dance, but unfortunately can barely stand now.  She loves this video because it contains dance moves she can do while seated in a chair.  The moves are simple enough for her to do, but is still a good work out and contains the type of movements she needs to work on to improve her coordination issues related to the stroke.",1532304000,,490,4.293478260869565
8720659,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Great exercise especially for those who are not mobile.,1520380800,,55,5.222222222222222
8720660,5,B00ZQPLZXK,"This exercise program is excellent for oldsters.  Gina has you moving all your joints, plus the music is really great.  There are 11 exercise tracks with different dance moves for each.  The tracks are just the right length--not too long and not too short--about enough time to follow each routine 3 times through.  There is also a track for a warm-up and a track for cool-down.  Her instructions are excellent and she never loses the count.  Also, she tells you how to modify the moves for beginners.  My only cavil:  the cool-down at the end is not wonderful--it should be longer with the stretches held for a few counts more.",1518048000,6,628,4.6454545454545455
8720661,5,B00ZQPLZXK,I love it. I couldn't help but smile throughout my workout! I want more.,1512604800,,72,4.214285714285714
8720662,5,B00ZQPLZXK,My senior exercise group loved this DVD. Laughed all the way through the workout.,1503014400,,81,4.857142857142857
8720663,5,B00ZQPLZXK,This is a perfect workout and Gina is such a caring person.  The music is wonderful and even though you are in a chair you still get a great aerobic workout.  Since I have been recovering from Achilles tendonitis for the past year I needed something that would not aggravate this.  This video really saved me!  I have tried others but this is perfect.  Please listen to the helpful instructions Gina gives and sit at the edge of your chair.  I have found that a pillow behind me when doing this helps me sit straight and is not a strain on my back.  Try it and see for yourself.  There is no other workout like it.  Please make another one soon!  Thank you for your smile Gina!,1502755200,5,677,4.25984251968504

8720666,5,B00ZQPLZXK,Love your DVD's wish there more.,1493078400,,32,4.5
8720667,4,B00ZQPLZXK,Great DVD. My biggest issue is wanting to find a program for people who would like to do these exercises at a slower pace. Even though I emphazise the fact that you do the exercises at a pace that suits them they still find that they need to keep up and because they can't they give up. I would love to hear of any updates  of programs for people without the ability to do the exervises at this level. Great for the elderly to exercise with fun and great music. Well done,1492473600,3,471,4.119565217391305
