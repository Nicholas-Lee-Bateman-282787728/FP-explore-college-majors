8461166,3,B002OPZ2UC,"Look, before we go too far here, let me be clear that this movie is pretty bad and most thoughtful people and fight fans won't enjoy it that much.  Then why did I give it three stars?  Because it's so bad that it's pretty fun in some ways.  Take the acting: it's fun to watch Rampage, Rush, Sugar, and The Dean of Mean try to act (actually, The Dean of Mean didn't do that bad a job truth be told, especially for this type of movie).  You get to see stellar fighters stretch well beyond their stellar capabilities.  I don't know but to me this makes them kinda more relatable.  Plus, actual actor Nick Mancuso (as one of the villains) overracts in a winking, nod-to-the-camera I-know-this-movie-is-poop type of way.  It's also always interesting to see how a movie is going to try and come up with a new way of getting the best of the best into death matches with each other.  In this one we have a syndicate of sorts who runs a televised betting service for the elite rich abducting the most famous fighters and forcing them to fight to the death or some loved one will perish.  Not original but decently executed.  There's some pretty graphic sexual content but I suspect that most people watching this will find that a plus.  So, there you have it.  A bad movie that still entertains.  Make sure the young UFC fans avoid though.",1333843200,2,1331,4.42798353909465
8461167,1,B002OPZ2UC,"I don't really care about the quality of the movie itself, I watched
it before and knew it is bad. But I thought I would get at least
a decent blu-ray video or sound quality. It looks and feels
like a dvd. Save your money and just buy the dvd the upscaling
of your blu-ray player will do the job!",1312675200,,296,3.95
8461168,1,B002OPZ2UC,"How can a movie with all these great UFC fighters stink so bad I'd rate it one star? The plot is stupid....a bad take on a much better movie with Stone  Cold Steve Austin ""The Condemned"" and the UFC guys are barely on screen..I mean blink and they are gone...what we have left is unknown hack actors with cheesy dialog and UGLY naked women...blech...and I bought the blu ray so I had to watch this mess in Hi-def....let me spare you the same waste of an hour and a half.",1294790400,4,470,4.222222222222222
8461169,3,B002OPZ2UC,THIS MOVIE IS WORTH A WATCH IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE UFC. THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE. IT IS KIND OF FUNNY TO SEE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE UFC STARS TRY ACTING. STORY IS KIND OF COOL IF THE ACTING WAS BETTER. IF I WAS IN THE RING WITH THIS HECTOR ECHAVARIA CLOWN HE WOULD TAKE A SERIOUS BEATDOWN.,1262476800,4,287,3.8
