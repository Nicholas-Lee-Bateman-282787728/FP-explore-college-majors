8506913,4,B006ZK66D4,I like Swiss air flights!!! The video was great and enjoyable!! I will watch it again and see the travel!!!,1395100800,,107,4.4
8506914,4,B006ZK66D4,"This is my first Just Planes DVD. I bought it because we'll be doing this flight over the summer (though in reverse), and I wanted a bit of background for the flight. As an aviation enthusiast, I found it most interesting; as an aviation scale modeller, I found the exterior shots, especially the pre-flight walkaround, to be most useful. As a future passenger, I wanted more of what happens in the main cabin, and a longer look at the work of the cabin crew. My daughter was less than impressed and was quickly bored with all the technical talk, though she really enjoyed the scenary shots. I will also admit to fast forwarding parts of the return flight...some of the technical sequences go on just too long.

Nevertheless, the crew are engaging, explain the technical stuff quite well (though it helps to have some knowledge already) and the video is well shot and edited.

I'd recommend this to the aviation enthusiast, but this is defintely not intended for the casual viewer! Perhaps Just Planes could consider making shorter DVDs that would be of interest to the more casual viewer, covering the work of the whole crew in greater detail, and more scenary shots, to market to travellers?",1358380800,,1193,4.758454106280193
8506915,4,B006ZK66D4,"Excelent video, very complete but need a multi cam option, needs some subtitles even in english because sometimes is very difficult to understand the comunications.",1342396800,,164,5.6
8506916,5,B006ZK66D4,"Incredible quality in the air.  Thorough explanations, excellent multiple camera shots, great scenery shots, great air to air shots, nice coverage of the flight crew in action.  San Francisco is orgeous from the air.  I still wish Just Planes would make separate chapters on takeoff and landing for the cockpit and the scenery, and this one gives us more scenery and less flying than typical Just Planes, but well worth the money!",1332028800,3,430,4.944444444444445
8506917,3,B006ZK66D4,"As with most Just Planes videos, this one is quite entertaining for the aviation enthusiast.  It is also nice seeing an Airbus cockpit up close.  Unfortunately, the sound quality of the video isn't the best - I had to turn up my volume quite high during some of the segments when the pilots told about the plane, only to have my ears blown out when the next segment started!  Other than that though, the video is quite nice.  The night flights are exceptionally beautiful.",1212019200,,472,4.583333333333333
