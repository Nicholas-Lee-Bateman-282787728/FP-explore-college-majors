1468229,3,B00005JLJP,"While Helena Carter is terrific in her role as Lady Jane (Queen Jane for 9 days), the movie as a whole falls short because it doesn't present the sequence of events convincingly.  The build-up to Lady Jane's crowning moment is rather lame and a little confusing, and the nine days of her ""reign"" are not documented well.  There's also too much of a love story, with her persistence in her faith more like a sideshow or afterthought.  Overall it's still an enjoyable experience, if it does frustrate the viewer a little.",1081814400,2,519,4.681318681318682
1468230,3,B00005JLJP,"It's a shame that the interesting and relatively untapped story of Lady Jane got this sugary sweet treatment.  It alternates between nubile pulp romance and engrossing costume drama.  So when it's good, it's very good...and when it's corny, it's ridiculous (even the score is over the top).  Excellent supporting cast.  DVD offers no compelling special features...it would have been nice to have some extra Tudor treat in there!",1077926400,3,428,5.25
1468231,4,B00005JLJP,"I loved this film for the great drama of a mere sixteen-year old being used for machinations of her family to ascend to the British throne. There is a scene where Lady Jane is punished (by spanking with a paddle or something) for disobedience; this is a harbinger of the ultimate tragedy for the hapless teenager. While the details of this historical drama are not precise, the tale is well-told and the costumes and scenery are magnificent. This is a good, riveting historical drama despite the liberties the screenwriters have taken.",1072569600,60,535,4.8901098901098905
1468232,5,B00005JLJP,"I too was a teenager when I first saw this movie, at the time I was really starting to fall in love with the Renaissance. (I ultimately studied Renaissance lit in college, and maybe this movie had a little bit to do with that!)
At my young age, I was of course drawn to the romantic part of the story--I was hopelessly enchanted with Cary Elwes, and I'm sure the blossoming romance between Guildford and Jane caused me a great many sighs. Okay, so it is a little fairy-taleish and not exactly true to history (I once read that it is uncertain whether or not their marriage was ever consummated) but it was awfully fun to watch.
Now that I'm older, however, I've noticed some other things that interest me more than the love story, like the political machinations of Northumberland and Jane's parents, and the stark portrayal of the treatment of women in that time period. Jane was vitally important to the plans of her parents, and yet they beat her nearly senseless for refusing to marry Guildford Dudley.
Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes are very believable in their roles--Jane seems otherworldly and disconnected from her feelings due to her obsession with learning; Guildford is a handsome rake who does actually have deep thoughts and ideas about things, contrary to what Jane thinks at first. Both roles were excellently played.",1066608000,28,1338,4.771551724137931
1468233,5,B00005JLJP,"From the first time I saw this movie nearly ten years ago, I was hooked.  To this day, I cannot watch it without crying!

I, too, saw this for the first time on TV and spent an entire summer obsessed with it, watching it over and over on the worn-out cassette I'd taped it on.  I love the costumes, the sets, and the music; Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful and Cary Elwes is great!  He's really an underappreciated actor, I think.  I realize that parts of the story are inaccurate, but as a whole it is very entertaining and well done, and will give you a good idea of life in 16th-century England.  I'm so glad this is finally on DVD!",1057017600,5,661,4.256

1468368,1,B00005JLJP,"I was quite shocked to discover the nudity inside the supposed depiction of the martyr, listed within Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Had the programme left out those details, and other scenes that do not accurately reflect the life of this Queen and Martyr, it would have been better. There are some good scenes though: the beginning and the ending. She did not like the hunting parties. She did ask where the block was and what to do. The other details show, if one did not know better, this person was not a Christian Martyr. I would not recommend it for home-school students to view. . . So, after getting through this programme, I wondered if the Martyr was upright and really written in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. . .she is. This could have been a lot better and kept closer to the life of this martyred queen. Had I known this contained nude scenes I would not have bothered to purchase it at all!

1468501,4,B00005JLJP,"Tremendously enjoyable movie based on the tragic story of a studious 16 year old girl, forced into marriage, and shortly thereafter to seize the throne, by her ambitious family - a move that ended in her beheading.
I was motivated to watch this after visiting Lady Jane's childhood home, and after reading her biography. The film didn't square too well with the latter - Helena Bonham Carter (brilliant in this role) portrays Jane as an increasingly immature and lovestruck teen. She, under the tutelage of husband Guildford, begins to see how the poor are ill-treated, and upon her coronation starts boldly making grand plans to improve their lot. I'm not sure about any of that... Or about the romance...
However watch it with an awareness that it's not entirely historically accurate, and it's certainly tremendously well-acted and brings this episode of history to life.",1403136000,,874,5.076388888888889

1468600,4,B00005JLJP,"""Lady Jane"" tells the story of one of British histories tragic figures, Lady Jane Grey, who was forced onto the throne by her manipulative parents and the father of her husband John Dudley.  Lady Jane was only queen of England for 9 days, but her story was a good one.  The movie takes some liberties with the love of Jane and Guildford Dudley, but it does capture Jane's will and her faith, as well as her strength in the face of death.

Great performances are given by young Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes.  While this movie is not as flashy as more recent portrayals of the Tudor error (as seen in Elizabeth, The Tudors, and Shakespeare in Love) the movie has a lot of heart and accurately captures the trials of being a woman, even a royal one, in Tudor England.  If you're a fan of the period this movie will not disappoint you.",1231459200,,838,4.380645161290323
1468601,5,B00005JLJP,"Well, we all more or less know the story of Henry VIII and his reign.  Most of it is attributed to his many wives and his effort to separate England from the Catholic Church.  But once King (Henry VIII and his son Edward) died, court had to deal with counry that is divided by church, religion and potential fight on who will inherit the throne.  Lady Jane was Henry's nice, daughter of his siter Frances.  Young and well educated, she is an idealist who is being used for political purposes by the court advisors and her own parents.  Without being groomed for power and reign, she is ill equipped to lead the country that is in trouble politically, economically and spiritually.  Newly married, she is deeply influenced by her husband and her own strong will.  It does not take long before Mary, her cousin and Henry's daughter with his marriage with Catherine of Aragon of Spain takes action to regain her crown and her birthright to reign Englad, Ireland and France.  With the help of the Spanish Army, Mary reclaims her throne and eventually executes her cousin Lady Jane, pretender to the throne.  Young Helena Bonham Carter gives wonderful performance of a young woman (Lady Jane) from aristocratic family, ill prepared for the duties her family laid out for her in unprecedented political coup that lasted only 9 days and took lives of most of her family, including her father and her husband.",1231113600,3,1401,4.732510288065844
1468602,4,B00005JLJP,"""Lady Jane"" is a really enjoyable film; it features very bravo performances by the two leads as well as good work by Patrick Stewart as the Machiavellian father.  The costumes are good, and the film does a very good job showing that people of this period really did consider controversies of religious dogma to be life or death matters for which people did indeed die. The love story between Jane Grey and her husband makes for a better story, but it is apparently bad history as in fact Jane was completely at the mercy of her father and forced in to what was, in reality, a loveless political marriage.

Nor were Jane and her husband the rebellious social reformers that the film depicts.  Once again, this makes for a better story but is not true to history.  No matter.  This is an enjoyable film that captures the flavor of a tumultuous period in history during which time most Europeans lived in poverty without hope or liberty.  Recommended for its entertainment value if not its fidelity to historical accuracy.",1230422400,7,1019,4.696629213483146

1468606,4,B00005JLJP,"Lady Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) has grown up around royalty, but she secludes herself from her family and reads. Her family takes it upon themselves to conjure up power for their daughter and for themselves. They arrange a marriage for her to the wayward son of a Duke, Guilford Dudley (Cary Elwes). When the sick king dies, it is arranged that Jane will become queen because of her Protestant faith. History has shown that religion is always grounds for conflict, and this instance is no different. To make matters worse, Jane and her husband begin disobeying the wishes of their court and work to make the poor happier.

This historical film has a beautiful love story, even if it isn't accurate. The relationship between Jane and Guilford is shown as it develops so it seems realistic and is all the more emotional when the lovers are separated. True, I could have done without some of the swelling music and the sunset close-up, but in spite of these overused gimmicks, the romance turned out very well.

1468691,2,B00005JLJP,"I was excited to see this movie but ultimately disappointed, mostly with the fact that it was turned so much into a love story between Jane and Guilford, when historically there was no love lost between them. I can understand feeling that the love story was needed to give the story some substance, but I think that idea is proven wrong when you read Alison Weir's superb new historical novel ""Innocent Traitor"", which, as far as I know, is far more accurate, and I couldn't put it down. It tells Jane's story from the time of her birth and truly illustrates the treachery and manipulativeness of her parents. And it makes it quite clear that Jane and Guilford were NOT in love.

To see the two of them falling for each other was boring to me-the politics of the succession are far more interesting, and to be honest after Bonham Carter's indifferent performance I really didn't care about Jane's happiness. And for someone who didn't want to be queen, she sure seems to be enjoying ordering people around in this movie. Bonham Carter didn't do it for me here and she does not do it for me as a much too old Anne Boleyn in the 2003 HBO series-she came off quite indifferent there too. Perhaps she just is not meant to play characters from this time period.

I hope they adapt Weir's novel into something, because the story really is fascinating, but it is not well executed here. (No pun intended).",1201737600,8,1398,4.5436507936507935

""Well, it would help if you promised not to steal my throne again!""

While such direlogue is thankfully in the minority, Lady Jane is still a film that some of its makers still seem to pretend doesn't exist: a very undistinguished debut for Helena Bonham Carter that she never talks about and enough of a financial disaster for director Trevor Nunn to later claim that his 1996 version of Twelfth Night was his screen directorial debut. Made during the British film industry's dark days of the mid-80s in a failed attempt to recapture the audience for the likes of Anne of the Thousand Days and A Man For All Seasons, it was one of only two films made by Paramount's much-hyped British production arm before they shut up shop (the Ralph Fiennes-Juliette Binoche Wuthering Heights was the other). It may have opened to even more public indifference than Elizabeth: The Golden Age but it's rather better than you might expect even if it is never quite good enough.

Lady Jane Grey's brief nine day reign as queen of England had been given a much-fictionalised screen treatment before in 1936's Tudor Rose, but this version had some (almost entirely unrealised) aspirations towards historical accuracy even if it does turn Jane and her wastrel husband Guildford Dudley (a name that sounds more like a bicycle race than a possible king) into doomed lovers when they hated each other all the way to the executioners' block. Both were very much puppets of their parents' ambitions: the dying young King Edward's protector Lord Dudley wanted to ensure the elevation of his own family from commoners to nobility to royalty under the guise of ensuring the succession of a Protestant monarch to protect the fledging Reformed Church, and the social-climbing Suffolks rather liked the idea of becoming royalty (though it was actually Jane's mother who had precedence in the line of succession) while their offspring had no say in the matter even if it was to cost them their lives. The film is at its best in showing the conflict between a young generation that had embraced the then-excitement and new ideas of a religion rejecting Rome and without arcane ritual and an older generation that had either profited handsomely from the dissolution of the monasteries or had suffered grievously and wanted to restore the old religion and with it the old status quo, although it never makes the obvious link between Jane's ferocious religious fanaticism and the unhappy, unloved childhood that appears to have driven her towards it in much the same way that the ostracised Queen Mary was drawn to her fanatical Catholicism.

Unfortunately, Nunn's direction is even more of a major problem than a watered-down script. He's fine when people are talking, even if they're walking at the same time, yet any more complicated form of action seems completely beyond him. And in this case action doesn't just apply to a pub brawl that's shot like badly blocked and under-rehearsed 50s television but scenes like Lady Jane throwing a fit in a room and knocking the silverware on the floor while supporting players very, very slowly try not to catch up with her and stop her: the camera is in the wrong place, the timing wildly misjudged, the actors' movements horribly unconvincing. They're the kind of mistakes you'd expect from an amateur movie maker's first efforts, not someone with a decent budget and a cinematographer with as much experience as Douglas Slocombe to advise him, and they make you half-glad that the modest budget didn't stretch to filming the story's offscreen battles. He also gives away his theatre background by framing many shots as if for the proscenium arch, never really embracing the possibilities and freedom of the movie camera.

Nor does he get the most out of some of the cast. Old pros like John Wood, Michael Hordern, Jane Lapatoire and Joss Ackland are fine (though most of the older actors have little, if anything, to do), as are Warren Saire as the dying young King Edward and, for the most part, Cary Elwes as young Dudley, but Bonham Carter's performance is particularly problematic. Looking even younger than her character's 16 years and nothing like the freckle-faced redhead of history, her performance is often awkward and fairly consistently unlikeable, making Jane less a tragic figure and more of a petulant Catholic-baiting little madam who got what was coming to her, a Tudor Wednesday Addams rather than a Tudor Rose. At times she looks less like a lost soul than a panicking inexperienced actress deliberately cast adrift without being told what she's supposed to do, desperately looking to the sidelines for help that's not forthcoming, all too often leaving you feeling sorry for the actress but nothing for the character. To be fair it seems to be more a problem of direction and it's not hard to guess which scenes were shot first from her awkwardness, although she visibly gains confidence as the film progresses.

Yet it's not all bad. It does show what a disastrous queen she would have made, although the film does give the impression that Jane and Guilford were a pair of hippie libertarians - indeed, with its Romeo and Juliet love story and bucolic romantic montage sequence you almost get the impression that this was intended as a Franco Zeffirelli film a la Brother Sun, Sister Moon. Bonham Carter's brief scenes with Hordern's Dr Feckenham where they pit their faiths against each other are the best in the picture and it's a pity there aren't more of them in David Edgar's screenplay, while the end is touching despite being almost as clumsily staged as the real execution (it's a tastefully bloodless affair here, though, quite unlike the reports of the real thing: one observer was moved to note that he couldn't believe so much blood could come from such a small body). Stephen Oliver's excellent score is good enough to make it a genuine shame that he never got to write any more, adding him to that list of talented British composers like Marc Wilkinson and Raymond Leppard who never got the breaks their gifts deserved. At the end of the day it's a watchable enough period piece for a Sunday afternoon, but one that probably plays better on TV than it did on the big screen.

The widescreen 1.85:1 DVD transfer is acceptable, though the stereo track impresses more. The only extra is a decent black and white stills gallery.",1197763200,8,6543,4.863677130044843
1468693,5,B00005JLJP,"After THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY V111 and before any of the ""ELIZABETH's"",( and the upcoming ELIZABETH:THE GOLDEN AGE with Cate Blanchett), PLEASE... stop and  a take an earth-shattering look at LADY JANE with Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes. This is one sumptuous film from acting right down to the magnificent and stirring Stephen Oliver Soundtrack. The story of Lady Jane Grey helps fill in the period of time and the players in the English Religious ""bloodbath"" that occurred between the time Henry V111 dies and before his first daughter ,Catholic Mary Stuart a.k.a. ""Bloody Mary"" ascends the thrown and before Protestant Elizabeth becomes Queen of England.
The story of Lady Jane Grey is truly the saddest IMO of them all. Intelligent,well read and fifteen,Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) becomes the unwilling pawn of her parents and others to keep a Protestant on the throne. She is forced to marry Guilford Dudley (Cary Elwes),another reluctant young pawn in order to secure the English Throne. Jane Grey's parents were known to be awful towards her, and Sara Kestleman as Frances Grey is as cruel and sadistic as a mother could be. The screenplay is quite direct and accessible and the characters are well delineated
in order to keep a very central story moving along. Historically, the only real liberties are in the creation and assumption of what transpires in the lives of these two in the very brief nine days where they are on top of the world,as it were. If the love story is fabricated....who cares...it's a good one done by two wonderful young actors of their generation!!!For nine brief days, Jane ruled England. Did she ever really want to? Historians and the director,Trevor Nunn resounding say NO;but like most players in that time,many lost their heads either willingly or unwillingly either in pursuing or fleeing the crown! The rest of this film is downright accurate and quite compelling.
Of all the ""English monarch films"" I put LADY JANE at the ""head"" (or should I say ""headless""!) top of the list. Anyone who follows the topic of the Catholic-Protestant ""throne trade-off years"" will love this one. This is a film to watch many times for its fine acting,cinematography,and  educational value. Chances are.....you will cry because history is quite unfair to innocent people!",1191974400,3,2299,5.015706806282722
1468694,3,B00005JLJP,"Lady Jane is a movie that has outstanding visual presentation (the costumes and cinematography).  Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes are well cast as Lady Jane and Guilford Dudley.  There is able support from Patrick Stewart and John Abbott.  However, this movie is more idealized than accurate.

Lady Jane is little more than an avatar for 1960s idealism in this film.  Having public schools, 20th Century style welfare programs were probably not on her agenda.  This is what detracted from the film.

The actor playing John Dudley was a good portrayal.  He really didn't care about the Protestant vs. Catholic conflict.  He wanted to maintain the Dudley family fortunes.

A very educated and pious Protestant woman, Jane Grey, who became the Nine Day Queen, was forced into a brutish conflict, which ended terribly. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is enchanting. The movie was shot wonderfully; yet. I think the romance with Cary Elwes (also known from the Princess Bride) helped counter the darkness of the struggle.

Warren Saire as Edward VI and Michael Hordern as Feckenham provide excellent sympathetic performances.

Jane Lapotaire as Mary Tudor, John Wood as Northumberland and Sara Kestelman as Frances Grey play well their parts of their nasty characters.

While I appreciate the story you have to be in a certain mindset to watch this. It is very tragic and shows a certain side of human existance that many don't want to see. The good girls and guys many times get done in by the bad girls and guys. You should see this at least once.

1468774,4,B00005JLJP,"Lady Jane Grey, niece to Henry VIII, was appointed to the throne due to the corrupt machinations of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. Her cousin, King Edward VI of England was a mere boy of 15 when he deeded the throne to her by deeming his sisters bastards (and thus severing the throne from the Catholic side of the family and ensuring that Henry's reformation would continue). Mary, Edward's sister, wouldn't sit still for this and she sought to overtake the throne upon Edward's death. Northumberland led the troops in an ill fated attempt to repel Mary. She regained the throne after only 9 days of rule by her cousin Jane Grey and her young husband, Guilford Dudley (an arranged marriage at the bequest of Northumberland and Jane's parents). Jane Grey and Guilford were subsequently executed for treason and heresy.

All of these points come out in the film ""Lady Jane"". However, the film is geared to being a romance and as such, the historical facts get a bit muddied along the way.

The acting is quite fine - indeed. Helena Bonham Carter, as Jane Grey, kicked off her ""costume drama"" career with this film. Cary Elwes, with only a couple of films under his belt (Another Country), as Guilford, strikes a handsome, roguish pose and delivers a finely controlled and believable performance. The rest of the cast is made up of fine British actors who are more than capable of carrying their own weight. The sets, costumes and script are fantastic!

This is a film I purchased for my meager DVD film library. It's one I tend to revisit from time to time.

It was a little slow at times, and I'll admit to finding it a few minutes too long, but, overall, I rather liked it. Naturally, I was quite disappointed to learn afterwards that the romance between Jane and Guilford was wholly fabricated. Some may complain that it ruins the film, but I disagree. I felt it was a welcome addition, as it added humanity and beauty to a bleak, tragic story, making it easier to relate to. I actually found the romance plausible, though not terribly likely. But I am a romantic, not a realist.

1468776,4,B00005JLJP,"History, so it seems, does not make good stuff for movies, so moviemakers tend to add bits of their own invention to make it all palatable to the moviegoing audience. In the case of poor little Jane Grey, one might just wish that her desperate and short life would at least have offered the comfort of such a passionate marriage as she gets here - which, alas, it didn't. Played out as a pawn in an elaborate succession ploy cooked up by her father-in-law, Jane was forced to marry a dispicable man, became queen for 9 days, and then, thanks to an inconceivably stupid eleventh hour rebellion by her father, went to the block with a calm dignity belying her mere 16 years. This movie has the gist of it, and makes for over two hours of good, solid entertainment. As costume drama goes, it is caught somewhere halfway between Errol Flynn and the BBC Virgin Queen. Sets and costumes are sumptuous if not quite historically correct (dresses, for instance, did not have all-round bodices, but were assembled from lots of bits and pieces pinned to the undergarments). Clearly, costumes were chosen for their dramatic effect, and as such work very well. Splendid Queen Mary in her red dress looks almost like Disney's witch Malificent, and the all white winter hunting party is very stylish indeed (though Star Trek reminiscenses are inevitable when Patrick Stewart appears in his stylized Tudor garments).

The acting is altogether quite good, with Bonham Carter, unsurprisingly, taking the laurels. Elwes does all he can with the heavily romanticized version of Guildford Dudley on offer in this script. It is hardly his fault that the rapid transformation from dissolute drunkard and whoremonger into ardent lover and idealistic defender of the poor does not come across as quite believable (he does better with the drunkard than with the idealist, by the way). Sara Kestelman is excellent as Jane's cruel and selfisch mother, and John Wood even better as the sinister, scheming Northumberland. Warren Saire deserves mention too, for his sympathetic and moving portrayal of the doomed King Edward VI. Jane Lapotaire brings subtlety to Queen Mary's character, and succeeds in making it felt that this queen isn't up for a very happy reign either.

This is a quiet movie, with a slow pace, that is carried by the believable chemistry between the two leads. It communicates a strong sense of the cruelty of those days, when death and disgrace were always lurking around the corner and individual fates counted for nothing. It does not eschew the clich&eacute;, to which it occassionally succumbs in rather silly ways (e.g., Jane muses on her impending death and a flock of birds flies by). The music is horribly bombastic and at times quite misplaced. Yet none of this results in serious damage, and the end, featuring a minute reconstruction of Jane's execution, may well leave you a little shaken; - the image of the blindfolded young girl desperatly groping for the block, is quite unsettling. In all, a worthwhile and interesting movie.",1140220800,16,3034,4.935420743639922

1468858,5,B00005JLJP,"First a bit of history:

The world of the Tudors and their friends, hangers-on and rivals from the time of Lancaster/York conflict, reads like a soap opera, and indeed it was a time of intrigue, deception, jockeying for position and occasional outright evil behaviour. The executioner's task at the Tower was never wanting for more; the Tudors, Seymours, Brandons, Dudleys and other such families were intertwined in the political, religious and dynastic machinations of the time, and sometimes this late medieval machinery caught up the people as it would grind along.

Lady Jane Grey was not born to be queen. This does not make her unique among monarchs in British history; when the current queen Elizabeth was born, it seemed very remote that she should ever advance to be monarch. Indeed, even the great Henry VIII wasn't the heir apparent when born; his brother Arthur was Prince of Wales -- Henry married his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon, and the successive sequence of wives and offspring commenced from there. Lady Jane Grey was born of none of these wives, nor even from Henry directly, but rather through one of his younger siblings, Mary, one-time queen of France.

Lady Jane Grey was a mere teenager when she came to power, such as it was. A precocious and intellectual child, she still lacked the political savvy of the Privy Council and other chief executors and leaders from Henry and Edward's reigns; she was the not-always-willing but not-unwilling pawn of her family's ambitions -- at one time thought to be a possible wife for the king Edward, her family jumped at the chance of settling the crown directly on her head, under the ostensible purpose of preserving a Protestant succession.

Ultimately, the venture was doomed to failure, for as much as the royal and parliamentary authorities like to believe they rule England, ultimately it has been the people en masse, and those whom they do not support do not last long. The common folk, still largely Catholic in leaning, also understood royal succession in simple terms -- Mary Tudor was the next in line for the throne, so they supported her (largely they would support Elizabeth, a moderate Protestant, for the same reason five years later). Lady Jane fell victim again to the problems of politics; Mary Tudor, once queen, was inclined to be lenient until it was felt that Jane's presence continued to be a rallying point for Protestant dissidents.

Jane Grey was queen for nine short days, during a period of great turmoil.

Here endeth the lesson.  And much of the similarity with the film.

This film is historical romance, which makes it necessary to fudge the facts a bit.  We are introduced to the scheming people around the ailing teen-aged king Edward; John Dudley (played admirably by John Wood) as Duke of Northumberland tries to ensure the Protestant succession through ruling out Mary, but also tries to secure his own hegemony by ruling out the independent Elizabeth.  Lady Jane could be controlled, or so promised her mother, Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk (played by Sara Kestelman).  Patrick Stewart plays Lady Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, but his role here is rather understated.

Truly the best performance in the film is that of Helena Bonham-Carter, in one of her early roles (fresh from the Merchant-Ivory production, 'A Room with a View').  She plays the intelligent but not always swift-on-the-uptake Lady Jane, competent in academic subjects, scrupulously moral, and history's plaything.  Whether all of these descriptors were true of the actual Lady Jane, we cannot know.  What we do know is that Lady Jane in fact despised her arranged husband Guildford Dudley, younger son of the manipulative Duke of Northumberland.  However, for purposes of the film, this is a romance, rocky at the start, but nonetheless a love affair that blossoms quickly - well, it would have to, given the time frame.  Cary Elwes, in his first major role, performs well as the companion to the unlikely and unwilling queen.

Elwes and Bonham-Carter have good chemistry together on the screen for the most part.  Bonham-Carter's other primary relationship is brief but substantial in the form of an intellectual attachment to the kindly Dr. Feckenham, a Catholic clergyman who is willing to engage in the theological discussion with a Protestant; Michael Horden gives a memorable performance as the intercessor between the Greys and Mary Tudor.

The cinematography is very good, stunning in a few points.  Costumes and sets are well done, and music overlay is worthwhile.

The story progresses through an abbreviated presentation of King Edward's illness, leading to the necessity  for succession.  The various intrigues and issues are collapsed into a few, primarily dominated by Northumberland; the ambassador of Spain and his dealings with Queen Mary also factor into the plot.  The impoverishment of the people, and the lack of popularity the ruling class had at the time is shown; the Protestant Reformations in England were not popular movements at the start.

As history dictates, both the younger Dudley and Lady Jane, nine-day queen, lose their heads over the affair.  We are given a glimpse of the historical reality that Lady Jane's mother was in fact 'rehabilitated' into the court of Queen Mary, but her husband Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, is killed for his involvement in an uprising against Queen Mary.

Setting aside the historical inaccuracies, this is a good film, well produced and well acted, and does serve to highlight some of the major historical themes of the time.  Perhaps it will inspire the viewer to read more and learn the actual events of the time, one of the more colourful in royal history.",1110931200,6,5716,5.019047619047619

I was actually unfamiliar of Jane Grey's story and it was *after*, that I started buying books about it and started to understand.

It would've been sooooo interesting though, if Jane were alive and kept queen...

And the importance of religion, etc..Gosh, Really! To be made queen, knowing how wrong it feels, and that you are punished because of it! It's one of the reasons I got so emotional, it's the situation she was in, it was literally beyond her control, unloved by her parents, abused, etc.

Helena Bonham Carter plays a credible role as the young queen-to-be who is manipulated by the intrigues of her parents and others into assuming the throne. Cary Elwes plays a perhaps less convincing role as Guilford of Northumberland, a Don Giovanni type bachelor who is not in a hurry to get married for political reasons.

The story seems to keep up its mood of historical drama until the prince and princess are united; it then almost desintegrates into a childish a fairy tale fantasy that is completely at odds with the drama. Prince and princess begin looking at the other with puppy eyes and dreaming silly things they would do. In short, the characters decend into a type of gibberish dialogue that can't possibly reflect the attitudes of those days. Fortunately,the tragic elements of history come to save the day and take Lady Jane Grey to the block.

1468863,5,B00005JLJP,"As is noted elsewhere, there is some artistic license taken with the actual story of Lady Jane Grey.  Most notably, Lady Jane and Guildford Dudley were not in love by any documents of the era, which renders the whole ""love story"" of this film invalid.
But as a simple period piece I really love this movie, and here's why:
1. Helena Bonham Carter gives a truly astonishing performance in her first movie.  This film began a string of ""period costume drama"" performances for the actress that have since been surplanted with modern roles such as ""Fight Club"" and ""Planet of the Apes"".  Her language - both spoken and simple gestures - are so expressive and she portrays a young woman who is well educated and full of passion.
2. The central conflict at the end of the film comes in her unwillingness to give up her religious beliefs.  She is a protestant and her cousin, Queen Mary, is a staunch Catholic. Mary wants to make up for a lifetime of slights and abuses given to her Mother, Catherine of Aragon, whom Henry VIII divorced when Mary was unable to bear a male heir to Henry.  The real Lady Jane was not only a protestant, but carried on correspondence with the great protestant minds of her day including John Calvin.  It is not often that any popular form of entertainment is made depicting a person willing to die for their religious beliefs.  I am not advocating protestantism, per se, only admiring this film's willingness to demonstrate a strong faith which doesn't involve religious fanaticism.
3. The real Guildford Dudley wasn't the love of Lady Jane, but Cary Elwes' performance here stands up well next to Bonham Carter's superlative one.  I suspect this role may have led to his being cast in ""The Princess Bride"".
Pretty much no extras on this DVD, but this is a truly fine film (albeit historically misleading), and it's not one of those $30 DVD's either.",1083801600,7,1874,4.674772036474164

7939567,5,B00005JLJP,"Although not an accurate historical account of Jane Grey's nine-day reign over England in July of 1553, this film takes that incident as a starting point to examine the use of power to positive ends, and how two completely different people can complement each other.  Helena Bonham Carter, in one of her earliest roles (and first starring role) plays Jane, presented as a deeply religious, bookish young girl whose sole interests are prayer and Biblical study.  Through the machinations of her father and other noblemen, the dying teenage King Edward VI names her as his successor.  She's forced into a marriage of convenience with Guildford Dudley, the son of the Duke of Northumberland, and a dissolute libertine whose main qualifications seem to be his ""controllability"" and his obvious incompatibility with Jane.

We soon learn that Guildford is not a dissipated burnout, but is genuinely frustrated with the limitations of the viciously cruel and stratified society he lives in, where the ruling class, of which he is a member, conspires to keep the common people in hopeless poverty.  When Jane, who has been sheltered from this truth her entire life, finally learns how her world is built on injustice, she understands that as queen she has no choice but to address this by ordering the breakup of the large noble estates and their redistribution to the peasantry.

If allowed to continue, this would have amounted to a Marxist revolution, only from the top down rather than the bottom up.  Instead, the revolution is aborted as the nobles take control.  If Jane had had her own Robespierre or Beria, to behead the nobility before they could behead her, the result might have been different.  In reality, of course, this never happened - Jane was not overthrown to prevent her from turning medieval England into an anarcho-communist worker's collective, but because the nobility switched their allegiance to Henry VIII's daughter Mary, who had a stronger claim to the throne.  Jane was declared a usurper and imprisoned, and executed after Wyatt's Protestant rebellion even though she was not involved in it.

The film takes liberties with the historical record to ask what would happen if a completely selfless leader decided to upend the class structure.  The depressing conclusion is that even this is impossible, and we are left with the same society we have now.",1495324800,,2374,5.043478260869565
