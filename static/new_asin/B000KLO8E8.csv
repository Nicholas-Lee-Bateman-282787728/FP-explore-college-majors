8174292,5,B000KLO8E8,This was an awesome year for team CSC at the Giro D'italia. When Basso taking the lead by the biggest time gap ever and Robbie Mcewen sprinting for stage wins it's packed with a ton of exciting footage. Milan bonus disc is worth a watch too....althought it wasn't anything compared to the Giro!,1180483200,,294,4.566037735849057
