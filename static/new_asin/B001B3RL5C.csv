8281797,3,B001B3RL5C,"not sure why it says ""Killer Canines"" above this & beneath the title 42nd Street Forever! Grindhouse Universe, but nontheless, I love trailer collections & this was good. I'm quite savvy with DVD & the players, etc, but as hard as I looked, there is NO commentary track anywhere on this DVD. If that's what you're looking forward to, DO NOT BUY! If it's the rare trailers you seek, then BUY IT!!",1431129600,,395,4.5
8281798,4,B001B3RL5C,"For some reason, this title is now out of print and commanding a ridiculous price, and before you purchase it you have to ask yourself, is it worth it??? The answer is no, no compilation of trailers is worth $25-30.00 - for chrissakes, they're just trailers! Few movies are worth this kind of cash. That said, is this worth what's asked for the first 3 volumes in this series? Hell yeah. This is at least as good as vol. 1 and 2, and they're fabulously trashy and kitschy, some of the most fun you can have with your clothes on for 2 hours. But it's somewhat misrepresented - not nearly all of these trailers are for sexploitation flix, so don't get your hopes up to that level of expectation unless you're ready for a big letdown. But I'm a big fan of trashy trailers, and if you are as well, this one delivers the goods adequately, so you'll definitely enjoy this sampler of sleazy, sinful 70's celluloid sewage - 42nd Street Forever!!!",1278806400,6,938,4.459302325581396
