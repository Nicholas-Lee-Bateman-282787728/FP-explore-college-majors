4000643,5,B002VPE1BQ,"I absolutely loved the movie! I believe that many are being to harsh on the movie. It was meant to be a lighthearted family movie and not to be taken that seriously. I thought the movie was an excellent reproduction of the tv series. I thought all of the actors did a good job expecially Noah Ringer. It was also a very well directed movie. In  my opinion, the movie was amazing with the special effects in 3D. Overall I thought it was a great success.",1278115200,12,452,4.255813953488372
4000644,1,B002VPE1BQ,"While not without a few cool moments, The Last Airbender really failed on all elements. The movie tried to fit the entire first season of the series into a 2-hr movie which made for a break-neck pace, but was oddly boring. It gave no time to flesh out the characters so the viewer has no reason to care. On top of that, I'm really unsure who to blame for the horrid acting. Most of the actors were newish so I can understand why they had a difficult time. However, if you've seen The Happening you know that M. Night Shyamalan has a history of giving poor direction to his actors so it's more than likely his fault.

Speaking of Mr. Shama-lama-ding-dong, he once again proved that he should not be allowed anywhere near a script. He absolutely OBLITERATED it! If you have not seen the series, you will most like have no FREAKING idea what the hell is going on. He makes the story that unintelligible. They have also turned it into a race war. The fire nation was Indian while all the other nations looked Caucasian. Not a huge deal but it was completely unnecessary. The only thing that shined through this piece of crap was the visuals. The bending was nice to look at, but they couldn't even get that right. They would do a martial arts ""dance"" for like 5 mins before anything (water, earth, fire or air) started to move. That's not how it's supposed to be.

If they have any hope of salvaging the movie series, they need to ditch Shyamalan. Let him go play with the murderous trees in his Village in the Water.",1278028800,18,1513,4.4
4000645,1,B002VPE1BQ,"How could M. Night mess this one up so bad???  The story, the character development, and everything is given and perfectly laid out already in the cartoon.  All he needed to do was bring it to the big screen with the visual life-like effects that were lacking in the TV series.  He didn't do it...  M. Night changed everything from the cartoon, even the pronunciation of the names! Why??  DO NOT GO SEE IT even if you have or haven't seen the series.  Spend your money and your time watching the cartoon. It is flawless unlike this seriously flawed movie.",1278028800,32,555,4.5
4000646,1,B002VPE1BQ,"This is a movie that might be fun to watch if you have nothing to do, live near a movie theater, and need a little special effects-style action. But if you are looking for a movie with relatable, developing characters, comprehensible plot, or decent 3-D effects, I would strongly suggest seeing another movie.

 The Good:

 -The special effects are pretty well done, especially the little details in the ladscapes.

 -There is decent action.

 The Bad:

 -The 3-D is terrible! During the previews before the movie started, things flew right off the screen and into your face. However, when this movie started anything that popped out only came about two inches off the screen. Through most of the movie I could take my glasses off and tell no difference. (Which I did.) Do not see this movie in 3-D. It costs more and just gets in the way.

 -The characters have practically no personality traits. I think throughout the whole movie only two characters have even one noticable trait that can seperate them from the other characters.
 Also, there is no character development. For example (spoilers) two characters see each other in one scene and talk for a minute and a half in another. Then the narrator says ""they are in love"". Then, when the girl dies, the audience is supposed to feel a deep sorrow for the boy who lost his love. But we didn't SEE them fall in love, did we? That makes it harder to connect with them.

 -The acting is hollow and there is no real emotion. Also, it is very easy to tell when the actors were performing in front of a blue screen, because they make forced reactions and seem to not really know what is is they are reacting to.

 -The plot is incredibly complicated. Although the characters (quite annoyingly) repeat plot points several times, they are adding nothing to the fact that nobody can understand what they are saying in the first place. I didn't understand what was going on until halfway into the movie.

 -There is almost no humor. The movie takes itself WAY too seriously. The landscapes are so bleak and the mood is so solemn that they suck the life out of the movie. Also, the humor from the cartoon is almost entirely gone.

 Overall, this is a very flawed movie with only a couple good qualities. I do not recommend seeing this movie but, if you do, don't expect much and please, please don't pay extra to see it in 3-D.",1278028800,20,2370,4.568720379146919
4000647,2,B002VPE1BQ,"I loved the show and this is the movie I've been looking forward to more than any other.  In the end, it is a huge disappointment but it did have some small redeeming qualities, but not enough of them.  I'll start with what I liked:

1) Sound Track.  I usually don't point this out, but I was actually digging on the sound track of the show, all except for one scene (the music built up but nothing happened on the screen).
2) Added plot elements.  They added a few plot elements, some I liked and some I didn't.  The one I liked was that the movie seemed to focus on building a balance throughout the world instead of, ""I'm the Avatar so I'm just going to destroy what gets in my way,"" like what the show seemed to say.  I liked it, it added a little bit of depth to the roll of the Avatar.
3) Special Effects.  I especially loved the special effects of the water and the fire.  The air and the earth bending effects sometimes came across as silly.

But there were too many negatives:

1) Too short.  The show was several hours long in the first book but this movie was less than two hours.  I think the movie would have been a lot more decent if Shyamalan had put more into character development, relationship building, and story.  Unfortunately, all he could cram into roughly 105 minutes where all the action scenes, which is not why Avatar was so beloved.  It wouldn't have cost him much more to add the character development and it is so unfortunate that he took a skip on it.
2) Added plot elements. So, Aang is not allowed to have a family since he is the Avatar.  What?  Why was this added into the movie?  In the show other Avatars were shown with family.  In fact, since he is the last airbender he really SHOULD create a family so that the Airbender Nomads can be re-formed.  Was this something that Shyamalan had planned on revisiting in the future?  For now, I just don't get it.
3) 3D.  I knew I wasn't going to like the 3D as soon as I had heard it was done post-production.  I should have followed my instinct and just caught the 2D version.  The 3D version is dark with very little life in the colors.  In fact, many scenes I removed the glasses just so I could enjoy the (blurry) scenes that were filmed.  If Shyamalan continues making this in 3D, I hope he shoots it in 3D instead of doing it afterward.
4) No character development and relationship building.  A real shame as this is what made the show so wonderful.  But Aang doesn't even seem to get along with Katara and Sokka.  In fact, if I hadn't seen the show, I think I would wonder why two kids where helping out the Avatar to begin with, or why the Avatar would even have them along.
5) Names.  I don't know why, but many of the names were re-pronounced for the movie, often times replacing hard vowels with soft ones.  Aang sounded more like Ung.  They didn't even say the word Avatar right.  Was this a copyright issue?  I can't figure out why this happened.
6) Poor editing.  This is a roller-coaster of a ride as locations and plot lines seemed to be thrown at us at 100 miles per hour.  This is not a compliment.  If I hadn't seen the show I know I wouldn't be able to keep up.  Again, transitions could have been helped along with the character and even plot building.

In the end, it is more bad than good.  It is a poorly executed movie and I expected more from Shyamalan.  If you where a fan of the show I'd suggest you wait until it comes out as a rental... a Netflix rental at that.  If you didn't watch the show I would avoid this movie like the plague.  In fact, do yourself a favor and watch the show.  The special effects weren't fantastic but everything else is FANTASTIC!

No matter what, I'd suggest skipping on the 3D version.  I wish I had.",1278028800,10,3740,4.256045519203414
4000648,5,B002VPE1BQ,"I am an adult and I don't know anything about the tv series. I went to see the movie for the special effects and I was not disappointed - they are beautiful!!! Particularly in 3D. The acting is good too, particularly the young Ang who is very compeling. The story also made sense. It didn't insult my inteligence nor jar my values. No huge philosophical issues (I was not looking for any). I am looking forward to the DVD release and the sequals. I hope they keep the same actors they worked very well. Does anyone know if this was filmed in New Zealand? I thought I recognized some minor characters as elves from LOTR.
p.s. I loved ""the sixth sense"" very much.",1277942400,9,661,4.382113821138211
4000649,3,B002VPE1BQ,"Ever since seeing ""The Sixth Sense,"" my nature has been to resist the films of M. Night Shyamalan. I have to admit that now. I'm aware of his technical skills and his ability to build tension, and yet something within me finds his work profoundly unappealing. I go in with an open mind, but then, minute by minute, it seems as if he's purposely trying to push me away with his unreasonably slow pacing, his amateurish dialogue, his bizarre character development, his ill-fitting sense of humor, and in some cases, his ridiculous plot twists. By the time I leave, a wall has gone up, and I feel cheated and angry. Many have felt the same way about ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening,"" but few agreed with me on ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs,"" and ""The Village."" The first even garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

Now we have ""The Last Airbender,"" a live-action 3-D adaptation of the Nickelodeon anime series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" Unfortunately, Shyamalan has proven he can alienate younger audiences just as easily as older ones. It's a children's film, and yet he didn't seem to have children in mind when making it; it's unmanageably plot-heavy, the dialogue is rife with incomprehensible exposition, the last minute 2-D to 3-D conversion is unimpressive, and worst of all, the characters are badly drawn - a mistake, I suspect, that was made worse with the casting of white actors in roles that were intended to be Asian and Inuit. There are a few enjoyable action sequences and moments of digital wizardry, but on the whole, I cannot envision anyone, kids least of all, making heads or tails of this film.

The premise is that, in an alternate reality, the world is divided into four elemental kingdoms: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each are people who can manipulate, or bend, the elements. The Fire Nation, having already overseen the genocide of the Air Nomads, is now waging war against the Earth Kingdom and the Water Tribes. From the Southern Water Tribe, we meet a teen waterbender named Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her brother, Sokka (Jackson Rathbone); while hunting, they crack open a gigantic sphere of ice, releasing little Aang (Noah Ringer), the sole surviving airbender who disappeared 100 years ago. As it turns out, he's also the Avatar, which is to say he's the only one with the ability to control all four elements. Apparently, he can go into meditative trances and have conversations with a dragon spirit, a skill that's never adequately explained apart from its obvious implications.

While well skilled in the art of airbending, Aang was never trained to bend water, earth, or fire. So begins his journey to the Northern Water Tribe, since, according to him, water training the natural progression from air training. He has to be careful; the Fire Nation is aware of his existence, and more than one person is pursuing him. Firstly, there's Fire Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis). Secondly, there's Ozai's exiled son, Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), who hopes to regain his honor by capturing Aang. Finally, there's Admiral Zhao (Aasif Mandvi), Zuko's main rival.

It seems basic enough, but the plot is deceptively weighty, mostly due to extremely long-winded explanations about various spirits, periods in history, peoples, places, and philosophies. Some are woven into unnecessary subplots. When Aang, Katara, and Sokka arrive in the Northern Water Tribe, for example, Sokka immediately falls in love a white-haired princess named Yue (Seychelle Gabriel); because so little time is spent on them, we can't invest in their relationship, nor can we absorb the details of her miraculous birth or her connection to the spirit of the moon. And then there's Zuko's uncle, Iroh (Shaun Toub), who really serves no purpose except to be an easy-going crutch for Zuko to lean on. He has his own troubled past, although it's alluded to so casually and briefly that one wonders why Shyamalan deemed it necessary.

What he seems to be doing is taking an entire series' worth of information and packing it into a single film. This isn't how it works; when it comes to a film adaptation, especially of a lengthy source, one must know exactly which story should be told and then proceed to remove the extraneous details. Yes, sacrifices would be made, but the simple fact is that movies generally require streamlines plots. There's no conceivable way audiences are going to take in everything ""The Last Airbender"" tells them. There's simply too much of it. Worse still, it's not told particularly well. If you doubt me, listen to the dialogue Shyamalan supplies Aang with. When he speaks, he sounds more like a modern-day kid than a revered figure of myth.

I don't want to write Shyamalan off as a bad filmmaker. He has disappointed me time and time again, but I can't help but feel that, somewhere deep down, he has what it takes to make a good movie. His previous films, even the ones I flat out hated, all had flashes of greatness. What he needs to finally realize is that successful films cannot be just about the craft; he must stop laboring over atmosphere and put some effort into actual storytelling. ""The Last Airbender,"" while stylistically and thematically different from his earlier efforts, is a burden to watch, an overstuffed and underdeveloped adventure fantasy that doesn't have any audience capable of following along in mind. Yet again, I have built up a wall, and its seeming less and less likely that I'll ever be able to knock it down.",1277942400,6,5494,4.895810955961332
4000650,3,B002VPE1BQ,"Critics have called the Last Airbender a bomb and I have seen many half star or no star reviews, but the movie isn't that bad. Noah Ringer is perfectly cast as Aang, the Avatar and last airbender, while the movie is visually stunning and Appa the flying Bison looks just like he does in the show.

  But the movie doesn't work too well due to the fact that it tries to fit a whole season of the Last Airbender in just an hour and 43 minute movie and that's counting the credits because it's more like an hour and 35 minute movie. The film is so fast paced that it counts on the unnecessary narration of Katara (Nicole Peltz) to explain what's going on half the time.

  The movie tries hard to be a faithful adaption of the show and in many ways it is, but mostly just look wise and story wise. The movie doesn't take enough time to make us care about the characters or even enough time to make us believe that Katara and Aang have formed a great bond. Plus Appa may look very impressive but he's wasted and under-used, we only get like 3 quick glimpses of him. While Aang doesn't make as big of deal about him as he does in the show. Here, he's nothing more than just transportation.

  I should also mention that a lot of the acting is pretty wooden. Noah Ringer as Aang and Shaun Toub as Prince Zuko's (Dev Patel) Uncle Iroh are the only ones that really shine. Cliff Curtis as Fire Lord Ozai and Aasif Mandvi as Commander Zhao seem like they have gone to M. Night Shyamalan acting school because they are as wooden as Shymalan is when he tries to act. They have way too much to do and way too many lines because they were really bad. While I never found Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) too threatening as Prince Zuko. Patel yells a lot and barks commands but I never really took him too seriously, but sadly compared to Curtis and Mandvi, his performance isn't that bad.

  In all, the Last Airbender still is a decent attempt to adapt a cartoon to the big screen, in fact it's one of the better attempts. But if there's more films by some miracle, whoever directs them needs to pace himself a lot better. Because the pace is so quick that it was hard to even get into the movie or even care about what happens. It's a shame because the movie looks great and Noah Ringer was at least well cast.",1277942400,7,2298,4.257471264367816
4000651,1,B002VPE1BQ,"Let me start this review off by saying that The Last Airbender was an embarassing piece of filmmaking. I could not see how the filmmakers saw the supposed finished product of this and thought it was okay to be released. I think M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director, but only in his element (no pun intended), which is obviously horror and contemporary science fiction. Going into the realm of fantasy and action was not an intelligent move for Shyamalan. I was strongly anticipating this film, and I was actually looking forward to see Shyamalan take on a completely new project, which I heard he was very passionate about. So, it had to be good, right? No way! The film was sloppy--an utter mess--the characters were extremely one-dimensional (I could care less for the fate of any of them). The only thing that got me through this film were some of the action sequences, which were, at times, impressive to behold, but they did not deliver quite as well as they should have. For one thing, there was always a set choreography in the art of bending, which was very aesthetically pleasing, but that never quite worked in tandem with the special effects. Another aspect of the film that butchered the overall aesthetic was the cinematography: it was never stable. I felt M. Night Shyamalan did not know what he wanted to do with the camera, or what he wanted to focus on. In other words, the camerawork was drab and quite awkward. For example, sometimes he'd have a long shot depicting two of the actors. He'd have one actor acting while the other literally blatantly seems to be waiting to deliver his lines. If the blocking is off, there are ways of concealing that. For example, instead of showing the two actors, show a close-up of the one communicating and then a close-up of the other actor responding. But no, Shyamalan was too fond of his long and medium shots without bothering to block secondary characters that were in the frame. Other shots were so close that when the lead would talk, his mouth would disappear under the frame. That is bad filmmaking. I felt Shyamalan was trying to apply some of the camerawork he used in films such as Unbreakable or Signs, but that kind of cinematography is too mundane for a child's fantasy film. Both Unbreakable and Signs were meant to embrace a sense of realism. The Last Airbender destroys the conventions of realism and it should be acknowledged and treated as such. For example, a director of photography such as Bruno Delbonel would have been able to treat this material like a work of art. If this film at least had good camerawork, I think that would have distracted me away from the daft plot, acting, and script discrepancies. I know Shyamalan wishes to make a series out of this, just like the show. I don't think he should give up on it, but I do think he should read a lot of the reviews for this film and try to enhance the story for the next installment. EIther he do that, or step down as director and become producer, and allow another person take the creative, artistic licenses with this material. Many have said this film marks the end of Shyamalan's career, and I say I definitely disagree. Many filmmakers hit rough patches in movie-making careers, and Shyamalan has hit one. I think he needs to return to the genre that has made him famous and begin casting A-list actors in his films again, because a lot of the reasons his latest films have been so bad is because of his casting decisions. He set the bar high with The Sixth Sense, and I think he can make a comeback. Hey, who knows, he might nail the sequel and regain his reputation again. Let's hope so.",1277942400,10,3636,4.58678955453149

4000740,1,B002VPE1BQ,So disgraceful.,1512950400,,15,7.0
4000741,1,B002VPE1BQ,"Wow, this movie is literal garbage. I hadn't seen it since I was around 12 years old. So a good solid 10 years went by. I recently rewatched the whole series again for the third time and couldn't resist in watching this. Somehow, I had some hope that I could see this differently. No. No. No. There are so many things fundamentally wrong with this adaptation that is embarrassing. It is obvious that NO ONE that was responsible for this film was an Avatar fan because I didn't see ONE THING that reminded me of the animated show.

Reasons why this movie sucks:
1. PRONUNCIATION. Ahng?! Awvatar?! So-ka?! Eroh?! HONESTLY WTF??! I don't give a flying f* that the director insists they say it in the traditional manner. Say it how the freaking show did!
2. Where was Sokka's humor and incredible intelligence when it comes to planning and tactics?!
3. Who is even Aang in this movie? There was not one single expression of his character. No compassion, peace, playfulness, humor etc.
4. Katara? No no. That girl was not even remotely CLOSE to the strong, independent, caring, and loving person from the show.
5. There was not a wise or humorous bone in Uncle Iroh's body.
6. Can we all just agree EVERY CHARACTER IN THIS MOVIE DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE CALLED A CHARACTER?! They might as well be sticks in the mud for all I care. Every character in the animated series was disrespected by this adaptation.
7. WHITE PEOPLE? Um, sorry not sorry but every character in the animated show is from some form of Asian decent. You couldn't even get that right?
8. The entire movie was disjointed and so many crucial moments were cut out. You cannot fit an avatar season into one movie. I don't care how much you try to convince me. There is far too much content.
9. Where is the flipping BENDING? Everyone is throwing punches and jabs instead of bending. What bender thinks ""I'm a fire bender but I'm not going to use it. Instead, I'm just going to punch people."" ALSO, can we just acknowledge that it took about 10 moves to perform one bending move?! I could easily run up and hit a bender right on the head while they perform one. single. move.
10. When was it a thing that fire benders have to have some source of fire in order to bend? NO. For the love of Iroh, NO.
11. Was Team Avatar even a thing? I think not. How many words did Katara, Aang, and Sokka say to each other? Little to none. They might as well be strangers.

I could probably go on for basically eternity but this movie doesn't deserve anymore of my time. This series is one of the greatest of all time. This movie could have been one of the greatest movies of all time. The content and creativity is all in the animated series yet they royally destroyed every sacred piece of it.

I hope some day that this story has another chance. I hope one day that someone who is a true fan will do this series justice by making another movie or even a well-developed TV show. For now, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS TRASH. Rewatch the series, watch Korra, or read the comics. This is a waste of your time.",1512432000,5,3047,4.398936170212766

Sokka is suppose to be the hilarious one and in this movie he was 100% serious the entire time. General Iro was suppose to be fat and funny which he was not. Sokka being hilarious in the cartoon is what made it hilarious as well as Aang being funny and a fun kid. and worse of all they pronounced the names wrong in the movie compared to the show.

There should have been at least 2 more movies to fall in line with the series while the avatar learned how to master earth and fire. Unfortunately on this movie too many critics ended any chance of seeing that reality. No movie to date has been able to follow cannon directly with books or animated series. That is the plight of converting story into live action. The actors were more than adequate considering most of them were minors. Watching this movie brought me right back to the animated series. It was refreshing to see a great story brought to reality. Too many people expect movies based on series to cover all the basis of the story line of the series. Unfortunately that is unrealistic since the time in a movie just does not allow for that level of detail. This has been proven in many movies based on books and series. If you want a good story with decent acting and great special effects designed to enhance the story telling, this movie will satisfy. Don't let anyone tell you something isn't good. Watch it.

4000978,5,B002VPE1BQ,"So I'm in the minority here but I quite enjoyed this movie!!!  I am a female in my late 30s and I started watching the cartoon from day one through all the chapters.  The series was fun to watch and I loved all the characters.  I see so many comments about how the movie missed so much info that was in the series so it only gets one star, but come on people!!!  I'm sorry but do you truly expect an entire season to be condensed into a 1.5 hrs movie and still tell EVERYTHING???  I thought the movie told the main points needed to not have a viewer wondering what was going on if they hadn't knowledge of the story beforehand.  The choreography of the moves of bending were beautiful to me...fluid martial arts, almost like a dance which was in the series..not the violent sharp moves of full fighting some seem to expect.  My 6 yr old nephew watched this with me tonight and he loved it as well.  This was his first experience of the Avatar and I am glad he enjoyed it.  So yes, I'm in the minority of opinions here but I say give it a chance.  But just be aware, there were suppose to be 4 movies total so the ending does leave a lot open to continue.  Since they aren't making the other 3, well you will have to finish the story via the cartoon series.",1491696000,,1256,4.127572016460905

The Bad:
- The acting is flat & awful... never have I seen such terrible acting, it's like they didn't even try. Actually I'm pretty sure they didn't try seeing as how Dev Patel was actually good in Slumdog.
- The script is unnatural & awkward. It's like a badly written fanfic... and not even the kind of bad fanfic that's so bad it's good. No, it's just bad.
- The action is limp, the choreography is uninspired. It's like the people who made this have never watched an actual martial arts movie?!
- The characters are unrecognizable from the original, both in appearance and personalities.
- WHY ARE ALL THE NAMES AND WORDS MISPRONOUNCED?!?!?! It's not like this is a book adaptation without official pronunciation. THERE ARE LITERALLY 61 EPISODES OF FULLY VOICED SHOW!!! There is NO EXCUSE on why any of the words should be mispronounced!!!
- Made me literally cringe at every scene

- Nothing

4001207,1,B002VPE1BQ,"""Show, don't tell"" is the first rule of storytelling. This movie is almost 100% tell, and that's the main reason it fails. Every character is a narrator; nobody speaks like a real person, they just narrate what's going on or deliver exposition. Because of this, any emotional resonance the movie attempts to create falls flat on its face. Thirteen year olds write fanfiction more gripping than this movie.

The cinematography is awkward. The fight choreography is a joke, and everything feels like a first take. The story attempts to take an entire season of a show-- 20 episodes each 25 minutes long-- and compress it into one movie. The pacing is so bad you can't tell whether it's supposed to be happening over weeks or a year or a single day. White people are cast in roles that should have been played by Asians.

I'm secondhand embarrassed for everyone involved in this movie. Imagine what you could have done with that money. Imagine what a competent director could have done with this IP. I hope M.

I went to see the premier when it came on the theater, and EVERYONE applauded at the end. And I m not talking about just kids, but adults as well. Unfortunately the critics didn't give it great review, but honestly, what do they know. The series was/is popular for a reason.
I hope they keep making ALL of the books from the tv series.",1471910400,,431,4.4

4001261,1,B002VPE1BQ,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  I've seen other MNS movies and loved them, and I had high hopes for this one.  I ADORE the original cartoon series.  I think it's one of the most beautiful and well-developed storylines ever created.  (I'm in my thirties.  I still watch it on a regular basis.)I was so excited for the live-action adaptation!

And then THIS happened.  This tragic mutation of what should have been a beautiful piece of cinema.  The dialogue was bad.  The actors' performances were stilted and unrelatable with ZERO chemistry.  (With the possible exception of Dev Patel.)  Some of the most important parts of the original were cut out, and the backstory on the Avatar and some of the other characters was explained unbelievably poorly.  I watched it with someone who hasn't seen the animated series and they were completely confused.  Heck, I've seen the series and I was confused!  I'm still not sure why the pronunciation of most of the names was changed, or why some of the personality traits were SO vastly different from the animated series!  (Sokka, for example.  One of my favorite characters In the original series.  He's funny, and smart, and brave, and inspiring.  His character in the live-action version is moody and boring.  Out of all the changes, this irritated me the most.)  The special effects could've been amazing, but they were just...meh.  Such a letdown for fans of the original.  Truly the worst film adaptation I have EVER seen.  (And that's saying something.)  So, so disappointed.  Save yourselves!  Give this one a pass.",1470873600,21,1575,4.867424242424242

4001299,1,B002VPE1BQ,"I score this at three stars just for the subject matter. Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the greatest modern epic fantasy stories. With deep likable characters and a stories that evolves and challenges you as it develops over 3 television seasons. This is not that story. This is the badly condensed mess cast with immature children hired straight out of some backwater high school and directed by everyones favorite flameout M Night Shamalamadingdong. This might actually be his worst movie, simply on the basis of how far he had to travel to mess it up this bad. The original animated show was a perfect storyboard of how to make a movie. There was virtually no room to mess it up. You had to work at messing it up. Just pointing your actors to the cartoon on TV and saying Do That! Would have given you The Lord of the Rings. Instead we got... this.

I have this one in my collection because I am obsessive about such things. Plus every now and then after watching the full TV show I pull this up just to compare the truly great with the truly awful. I warn you do not attempt to view this without protection. Preferably Vodka or Peyote. You have never seen kids acting this bad. Not even Jake Lloyd. And he ruined Star Wars. In theory this should be a great kids movie, but I suspect showing it to one could get you charged with felony child abuse.",1469145600,3,1356,4.402390438247012

8382337,1,B002VPE1BQ,"When the ""Korra"" series came out, I wrote a long review of Season 1, Episode 1 that broke everything down I felt was going on with it. It was on the critical side, and many readers called me out on it. After the series ended, bringing the franchise to its demise along with it, I stand by my original review with a few caveats.

One thing I would modify if I wrote a review on ""Korra"" again, being a die-hard AtLAB fan, was the modifying or cutting of cannon established by the original series, to make plot decisions they already had in the works make sense. In some ways, I felt like ""Korra"" was an attempt to remake someone else's brand by a new owner who thought they could do it better, bolder, and make more money. Inevitably, when they realized what they had done alienating original fans, the fanbase that made it what it became, they attempted to throw bones by giving minor cameos of previous favorites like Toph, Katara, Iroh, and even Ang on occasion, only to wipe out all possibility of a future ""Avatar"" show by obliterating the consciousness of all previous avatars for the sake of a plot device. Sadly, that did not work out so well and viewership plummeted until, finally, the show ended on an odd note.

Even so, if ""Korra"" had not ridden on the coat tails of AtLAB, it would have been a good stand-alone series. It had likable characters, some interesting storylines, drama, AND some pretty exciting bending.

Compared to M. Night Shyamalam's ""The Last Airbender"", ""Korra"" was high praise to the series, true genius.

""The Last Airbender"" is to Nickelodeon's ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" what a Taiwanese knock-off of the GO-BOTS is to the original ""Transformers"" cartoon series. There is nothing of the original in this film. Nothing. It has been said by many of reviewers, but I will break it down here:

1.) There was poor acting. Ang was a happy guy who enjoyed being a kid, even with awesome power. He did not get depressed and melancholy until Season 3 of the original series, but even then he did a LOT of goofball stuff. The portrayal here was bitter, lamenting, and sad-sack mopey the entire time. His was not the only exact opposite, however, as with Socka's silliness in the original offset by his attempts to appear more manly and warrior-like. He had a gift with strategy, and always had some sort of plan. That was his main contribution when the others in ""Team Avatar"" were bending. Socka in the movie had little silliness and no real leadership skill. Things just lucked out in their favor. All other characters we met were in some way, more or less dramatically, the direct opposite, physically AND in personality, of what they were in the original.

2.) Fundamental rules of bending, fire bending in particular, were changed to fit unnecessary criteria as if it was just a personal choice of the director. The problem is that when you have successful source material, it became that way for a reason. People liked it the way it was. If there is no reason to change it, it is a very good idea to leave it alone.

3.) Every Asian of Japanese and Chinese descent who saw this film should be protesting this movie's blatant shift in socio-ethnic culture, which was foundational to this world. No one believed that anyone in the original series was another race but Asian unless it was an anomaly, like the people who took over the Air Nomad temple. It would be like James Earl Jones playing Abraham Lincoln! I LOVE James Earl Jones, but he would not fit the role! It would be the same if Spike Lee directed this movie and made the entire cast African-American and set it IN AFRICA. It could have been a prequel to Black Panther (a great movie). That might have been interesting, and they might have given great performances, but it would STILL not have been ""Avatar: The Last Air Bender"". If it had been done by Michael Bay, and all the setting was placed in ancient Britain, all the characters cast as Caucasians, the entire world would accuse it of WHITEWASHING. Why is it ok if it is done by M.Night?

4.) The casting of ""The Last Airbender"" was bad. The actors were not horrible, but the parts they played were all wrong. Maybe that had to do as much with the script and which plot points they chose to take from the original, but so much of this film could and should have been done differently I am not sure the players had much latitude to get things right.

My family watches the original AtLAB and sticks to that. We do not overwatch it, but we generally pretend that nothing came after it and in some way it just lives on its own in some reality where things happened after that made more sense. Happy-go-lucky Ang does not end his journey in a grizzly murder when he is 20 perpetrated by a slick blood-bender with opposite blood-bender powers for the sake of Korra's transition to fame and glory, we don't go from 1400's feudal China complete with sword fighting and campfires to slamming into a 1945-95 version of the Earth Kingdom complete with television and movies, motor-cars, and GIANT ROBOTS, and all don't get ripped off royally by an egotist trying to hijack a series and insert his own ethnic background into the foundation, gut all fundamental elements and add quirky versions of his own just to satisfy some personal agenda.",1526169600,,5280,4.59660297239915
