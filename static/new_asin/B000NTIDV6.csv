8181232,3,B000NTIDV6,"If you like The Who, then you know they're at their best when preforming live. This video is no exception. Although it's in black and white, and the sound quality is less than perfect, it does contain some hard-to-find-live songs from the Quadrophenia album. This video is for the hard-core fan, so if your a novice or new comer, this probably isn't for you. Collectors beware, video and sound are marginal so don't expect DVD/CD quality, but it's a good addition to any fans Who collection. If the analog to disc tranfer were done better, it would have been a 5-star production, but 1973 recording techniques leave a lot to be desired, and there's only so much you can do with a computer!",1245456000,,689,4.609756097560975
