8105007,5,B000E3734O,"Great video and sound quality. Played on a standard DVD player with not problems at all.(not played on blue-ray or a computer) The description of the content on the back of the DVD is accurate, but cannot even express the splendor of what you see during the program. These estates are just as spectacular as any of the Newport or Gold Coast estates.",1413331200,,349,4.555555555555555
