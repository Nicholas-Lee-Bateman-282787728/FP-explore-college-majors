The story is great, and the action in this movie is too good. Also Janemba makes his appearance in this movie. Also Gogeta!! Goku's Super Saiyan 3 form too!!! This is one of my favorite DBZ movies.

2466695,5,B000CNGBVW,this was a great movie but gogeta isn't in the movie for more than 40 seconds that is th only bad thing this is a totally awesome movie for dbz fans of all kinds,1295308800,,161,3.764705882352941
2466696,1,B000CNGBVW,"OK, I am completely baffled by all the positive reviews on this. This has to be one of the worst DBZ movies. Ever. I won't rehash the story but focus on my major gripe: screentime. We all know that the ""cool"" part of anything DBZ is where Goku & Co hit some new power level. Now, we've seen Gogeta before, but never as a result of the fusion dance, so we'll consider that the ""new power level"" here. OK, out of 50 minutes, how much time to do you think is given to SSJ2 Gogeta? About 30 seconds. I'm dead serious about this. Pikon screaming insults at a big yellow bubble enveloping Grand Kai's palace gets more time than Gogeta. In fact, the failed fusion of Goku and Vegeta (Vekku) gets more time than SSJ3 Goku and Gogeta combined. If you like a fat, failed fusion running around farting, then this is for you. Otherwise, this is the worst ever. The first 25 minutes is devoted to a fast, silly development of the story. The last 20 minutes (aside from some solid SSJ3 action for a few minutes) are devoted to the build-up to Gogeta. The fusion happens (after 5 minutes of Vekku running around) and then Gogeta multi-punches the bad guy once, knees him, kicks him, shoots him with rainbow energy and then watches him dissolve. Then queue everyone else happy about how it turned out and roll credits. Just. Terrible. I honestly can't understand how this is 4.5 stars unless the mere presence of Gogeta automatically = 5 stars for most people. Avoid this one like the plague (and if you MUST see it, rent it for sure).

PS This only gets the single star because the SSJ3 action is solid (about 3 minutes). It's the most enjoyable part of the movie after the huge letdown that is Gogeta's blink-and-you-miss-it appearance. Otherwise, it'd be zero stars.",1279756800,2,1753,4.512578616352202
2466697,5,B000CNGBVW,"I got one of the steel books movies and the quality was pretty bad like the Season Sets are. So I got this because it wasn't color saturated and had missing grain like the Steel Cases were ( Basically it isn't Digitally Remastered, FUNimation didn't change anything ) And I have to say the quality is a little better then the Steel Cases. The movie is pretty good but is a little to short ( The Gogeta Vs Janemba fight Could have been longer ) So yea pick this up if you havn' t picked up the Steel Cases, its a great buy and cheap ( I didn't buy mine from Amazon.com I bought it from somebody for only 3 bucks ) Well that's all I have to say about this product.",1266796800,,662,4.0227272727272725
2466698,2,B000CNGBVW,"I just now watched this movie, after being a fan of the original Dragon Ball manga and the current Kai director's cut of the Z portion of the dragon ball storyline... most of the DBZ movies are at least slightly enjoyable... this one however is just a huge pile of WTF through and through with some decent Super Saiyan 3 action tossed in for the hell of it.

Continuity is a huge thing for me, and the question about when most of the DBZ movies could possibly take place on the timeline as always varies from movie to movie... this one just doesn't fit at all. There was no point in the original manga or DBZ series (even with filler time counted as canon) that Vegita and Goku could have been in hell at the same time and dead with Buu dead as well. After the fight with Kid Buu, Vegita and Goku are both alive... EVERYONE IS ALIVE!! This could have been easily been explained away by having everyone take part in the otherworld tournament and whatnot, but no, for some stupid f***ing reason the director decided to say, ""Screw continuity and making things make sense to fans, let's just make a bunch of cartoony political jokes about hitler and have a fat fusion between Goku and Vegita last longer than Gogeta's fight with Janemba.""

With all that in mind, I should just give this movie 1 star... but the whole film isn't bad, the concept is fairly solid... it just carries a ton of baggage in the continuity and gag department that does a better job of making FUN of the source material than paying homage to it.

I'm sorry to all you die hard DBZ fans, but this one is certainly one to avoid. If you want Gogeta action, buy Dragon Ball Z Tenkaichi Budokai 3 or Dragon Ball Raging Blast... they both hold the character in a slightly better light than this peice of trash.",1262649600,,1775,4.3890577507598785
2466699,5,B000CNGBVW,this was worth the purchase bcuz there were lotz of funny moments with goku nd python and goten. The fusion was great and the fightin were good2. All in all it was one of the good episodes!! i recommend this definitely,1189296000,,218,4.341463414634147

2466701,5,B000CNGBVW,"This movie is great, even though Vegeta didn't feel like ""Dancing like an idiot""  he came to his senses and agreed to help Goku battle Janemba and perform the fusion dance.  Plus with having both Gogeta & Gotenks in this movie that made it 10 times as much exciting.",1182556800,,266,4.408163265306122
2466702,5,B000CNGBVW,"I love this one. Maybe because it has gogeta in it or veku but its really good. I wish they had the fight with gogeta a little longer and showed more of his abilities. Other than that it was a really good movie, if only it was longer..",1179014400,,235,3.9166666666666665
2466703,5,B000CNGBVW,One of the greatest DBZ movies in a long time.  This movie has everything.  Even if you did not follow the whole DBZ show this film will deliver.  It's comical most of the time and it a hilarious messed up fusion technique between goku and vegeta. It's just great.,1168992000,,264,4.346938775510204
2466704,3,B000CNGBVW,"Well I'd have to say this installment of Dbz movie 12 is a bit hard to review. Theres only two things you can really decide with it. Either you love it, or you hate it. Basically it starts off in other world. You see Goku and Piikon, as you guessed it, in the finals of another other world tournemant. When all hell breaks loose at King Yamas palace due to a young worker, not paying attention, letting the spirit cleasning machine overflow causing one of the containers to erupt. As you guessed it, a new monster is formed! Thats all Im gonna get into about that with out giving it away.

Now theres a few good things and a few bad things I've found while watching this. I'd have to say one good thing is it does provide some bit of comic relief(Fat Gogeta mainly). Other than that theres not really much else that I found very exiciting about it. Its spread rather too fast for my taste. It also cuts around to differnt scenes at a very quick pace. If your not careful you might get lost on whats going on. The Final fight scene with Gogeta and Jenemba is over in a flash. Seriously, if you blink....you'll probably end up missing it. The way the cover shows it, you'd think you'll be seeing good longer portion of Gogeta. Really thats what it lacks. Don't let the cover fool you.

All in all, I wouldnt recomend watching this if your not a fan of the Dragon Ball Series. You probably won't like it all that much. If your a hardcore DBZ fan, you'd probably love this. It's a decent piece to pick up and add into your collection.",1168041600,,1530,4.290657439446367
2466705,4,B000CNGBVW,"Ok I rented the uncut and it was awsome!

 Basically its about I guy in the underworld whogot in-fused with evil energy thus creating Janemba! Goku and Vegeta make Super Gogeta and its totally radical! Buy it,rent it. Whatever just watch.",1165017600,2,238,4.780487804878049
2466706,4,B000CNGBVW,"This movie is basically about how a worker at the Other World Checkin station gets careless and accidentally releases an evil creature that was made by combinig all evil souls that went to hell. The creature possesses the boy and the boy turns into a yellow and very much Buu looking creature. Goku in the meantime fights against Pikkon in the Other World tournament and rush to the scene when they here the news. The creature has broken the barrier between the real world and spirit world and is allowing the dead to roam the real world. Goku and Pikkon are in the Other World and Vegeta joins the fight. He and Goku decide to fuse after The evil monster known as Janemba transforms from his ""Buu"" form to a much better looking form. They fuse and the first time, there is a surprise result as they fail to fuse correctly. Janemba is soon destroyed by Gogeta and the Z warriors save the world once more.

I thought this movie was funny and cool. When the dead come back, all the villains that the Z warriors defeated like Frieza, Recoome, Bojack, Zangya,etc. all gang on Gohan aka Great Saiyaman. Also, Trunks and Goten have a bit of fun with Hitler and his German army.(this was just hilarious as Hitler has never seen people who could transform like saiyans.) The fusion technique fails the first time Goku and Vegeata try it and a 5 minute funny scene happens as they get abused in a comical way. This movie is funny, sweet, cool, etc. It's just that all the movies in Dragonball Z are the same. Monster attacks, Z warriors suffer, Goku prevails.",1163894400,,1550,4.516014234875445
2466713,4,B000CNGBVW,"I am from Portugal and I have seen this movie a long time ago in the cinema,but in Dvd at home is really something...Handsome!",1151193600,,126,4.291666666666667
2466714,5,B000CNGBVW,"Yea like the title says, this movie does a good job of building up the intesity in the beginning of the movie. It also does a good job of keeping everybody in action instead of just sitting there and stating the obvious like always. There were two parts in the story that were a huge huge letdown though. When Frieza comes up and starts calling out Gohan, and Gohan kills him just like that. I was really looking forward to seeing a good and challenging fight between Frieza and Gohan and it would've definetaly been a good touch to the movie. The second letdown was the ending. So far, of all the DBZ movies I've seen they all end the same. The climax builds up and up and up and up, and im guessing it builds up too high because the enemy is always beaten by a single blow. We need a little barbaric violence here, i mean u know its a monkey...and monkyes don't hold back, TRUST ME. But all in all the movie is pretty good, so i would definetaly recommend this movie to any DBZ fan out there...ENJOY!",1149638400,,1002,4.2513089005235605
2466715,5,B000CNGBVW,"I've looked through the other reviews for this movie and I can't help but be disappointed. This movie owns. Since I watched the english-subtitled version two years before I've been dying to get my hands on this movie in english and even though there are a few script changes, I was thoroughly satisfied with the outcome. As for the Bojack thing. If you pay very close attention you will see most of the villans from the series and previous 11 movies fly up. Including the Ginyu force, cell, buu, Lord Slug in his basic form and his goons, Cooler in his basic form, and even Broly in his basic form(far right). If you like the movie in English, I recommend watching the Japanese version in English Subtitles. While you'll be laughing for the first ten minutes because of Goku's high japanese voice, the final attack scene is like a boost of NOS. Beginning with the quote ""I am not Goku, nor Vegeta, I am the instrument of your defeat.""",1146268800,4,934,4.5325443786982245
2466716,2,B000CNGBVW,"Okay, I admit that Gogeta is a cool character (I think Veggeto and SS4 Gogeta is better than SS2 Gogeta), but I think it might just be a rental movie. I don't want to give away the story but I will say this, Gogeta appears in this movie for about, oh lets say 3-5 minutes total. I watched this movie in Japanese on that youtube site and I was a little disappointed. I thought for some reason that this movie was never going to be released (mainly because of the fact that Hitler is in this movie but gets his butt kicked) but now I think I was better to not see it and just play one of the Budokai games as Gogeta and beat the crap out of the other characters with him.",1145318400,,669,4.0
2466717,4,B000CNGBVW,"Fusion Reborn is a pretty good Dragon Ball Z movie, mixing in plenty of action with some decent humor. The Plot revolves around the Otherworld Tournament part 2 in which Goku and Pikon are battling in the finals once more, but the match is interupted when an accident at the Checkin Station results in the creation of Janemba, a being of pure evil. Goku and Pikon go to battle the threat while the hoards of the dead attack the earth. On Earth Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Videl, and Mr. Satan battle the undead, while in Hell Goku turns to Super Sayin 3 to stop Janemba, when that fails he must resort to the most powerful technique, but is there any one to fuse with.

This is a solid action title, that will please the fans and is over all entertaining. Well worth watching.",1145232000,3,770,4.422535211267606
2466718,5,B000CNGBVW,This is probley the best of the Dragon Ball Z moives and here is why. This one has Non-stop action full of humor in between parts in the movie. The movie starts of with king yama working at the check in station when the ecto tanks over fill and creat a monster called Janempa a big fat monster who lets the dead walk free on erath. Meanwhile on earth Gohan Videl and Goten here the news and meet up with Trunks to fight the dead and end up meating Friza and his army (Which had a frog in it) of all the bad guys that the Z fighters had battled. How ever Friza and his army or dystroyed in secouds. In upper world Goku fights Janempa and it turns out that he is as strong has a super saying 3. After Janepa is deafeated he morphs into his secoud form Janemba which is stronger then a super saying 3. I am not going to give away the rest of the movie but this is defintilly a must buy for fans.,1145059200,,892,3.9611111111111112
2466719,5,B000CNGBVW,"It is a brilliant Dragonball Z movie!!It is about an industrial disaster has been unleashed in the Othere World as Goku and Pikkon are fighting. As a gargantuan monster and the Z Fighters are taking action! Janemba's arraival has thrown the dimensions into turmoil, leaving the door between worlds open so the dead are rising from the graves. To combat this evil, Goku must transform into a Super Saiyan 3, but not even becoming Super Saiyan 3 is enough to stop Janemba. Will Goku be able to stop Janemba buy the movie and find out it is well worth it!!",1145059200,,553,4.54
2466720,4,B000CNGBVW,"It's Dragonball Z at its finest. Goku and friends once again must save the world from some type of evil. For a 55 minute movie, it's what you'd expect from Dragonball Z, lotsa fighting and a little bit of slapstick and parody-type humor, with a little bit of plot, nothing more meaningful than that.

The action in this movie is solid for being 11 years old (released originally in 1995) and can still stand up against many other fighting animes and sequences out right now. The sequences and locales are sometimes quite imaginative... (who'd've thought fighting in a world of jelly belly beans would be so amusing?)

On the conversion. The video quality is crap and nowhere near polished... Funimation could've at least remastered the animation. Not sure how the quality was when they released it out in Japan... or if it was widescreen originally. Japanese language is as stated... mono. Japanese subtitles were surprisingly direct using those -kuns, -sans, and what not... it sounded accurate... but I'm no linguist. English dub I didn't check and will have no comment. I'm expecting the same amount of quality as their previous Dragonball Z dubs.

That's my 2 cents on it. One more Dragonball Z movie is left. Little Trunks gets his sword on that one. And it was a little darker compared to this sometimes light-hearted movie. Look forward to it. I will.",1143849600,,1358,4.844827586206897
2466721,4,B000CNGBVW,"this movie in my opinion was really good, it was good to see a gd dragonball z movie since the dissapointing bio broly movie which sucked....

It was good to see Super Saiyan 3 Goku again, fights were good, and the music suited the scenes well, and who can forget the mighty gogeta! the only thing i found bad bout this movie is you didn't get to see gogeta for that long jamenba and gogeta should have had a fight to the death but instead it ends so fast,

I recomend  this movie to any dragonball z fan u won't be dissapointed.... only got three words FU SION HA!!!!",1143763200,,568,4.192660550458716
2466722,4,B000CNGBVW,"It's tough to review movies because you don't want to give away too many details.  But at the same time, with Dragonball Z movies, they all seem to follow the same pattern (A *monster* comes or is formed, is dealt with, then powers up to a level beyond the heroes, but the heroes somehow band together and find a way to win, etc.) anyway.  This one to me was one of the best DBZ movies.  In a nutshell, the movie's about a mistake taking place in the underworld by a bit of a slacker that has dire consequences, bringing the dead back to life while combining loads of negative energy into one being named Janemba (or Janempa - can't remember which form was the fat one vs. the sleek one).  After the fat one is dealt with, the sleek one's more than a match for the powered up Goku and Vegeta sucker punches the villian to save his life, etc. etc. (you've seen it before).  This time, Fusion's the only thing that may be able to save the day.  It was interesting though - you even get to see Freiza & the Ginyu force come back to life in this one, along with another movie villain (albeit briefly... if you blink you miss it) - Bojack and some of his minions.

This movie lines up with the Buu saga and as such, some of the same concepts take place (Fusion, Saiyaman, etc.)  So you know what relative power the villain would have - although this one had a sort of teleportation power that was pretty neat, and that it would take a Fusion of Goku and Vegeta to stand a chance.  The action was pretty good and I really liked how unlike previous movies, this time the powered up villian didn't spend 50% of the movie beating up the heroes and Goku/Vegeta got a few shots in - leads more to the imagination - I liked that Goku did somewhat okay against the monster before the sword was deployed.

There were a few negatives though to the movie.  As for the movie, I wish they didn't worry so much about time, as they couldn't done a few more interesting things with Freiza coming back or Cell or whoever.  2, I like how funimation does voice-overs.  But in this movie in particular, they changed the dialogue a bit too much from the original japanese version.  You can tell in the end of the movie - the Japanese/American version had Trunks/Goten joking about completely different things.  And then at the end of Fusion, the dialogue between Goku/Vegeta, which wasn't fitting to Vegeta's personality.  Throughout the argument with Goku/Vegeta - the USA version took away from Vegeta's dejection, eliminating a pretty important piece of their relationship which would eventually close the series, let alone when Janempa's sword crumbled and why (which stems from that).  Finally, funimation did a pretty lousy job at distributing this to outlets.

Still, it's a good movie that I definitely recommend for any and all Dragonball Z fans - maybe the very best (not sure if there's another one left), and Funimation was smart to include the Japanese version.  Check it out!",1143590400,11,2963,4.525328330206379
2466723,5,B000CNGBVW,I have seen the orignal japanese version and this english version is so freakin sweeter than the japanese version expecially with the addition of the sweet rock music.

2466724,5,B000CNGBVW,"When I was in the eighth grade, I was obsessed with this DBZ movie, waiting for it to come out.  Now, it is!  Don't think this is going to be horrible.  This is probably one of the best DBZ movies they have ever made.

For you corny fans:

-They show Gojita messing up on his fusion.

-Janemba is the best villain besides Cell and Buu.

-Vegita cries.

-All villains escape from Hell!  Friza and Cell go down to earth.  It is the time when Videl, Trunks, and Goten were involved in DBZ.

I cannot wait for this movie to come out!  They might butcher the English dubbed version, but if you think about it, the DVD will come with the Japanese version as well.  You have a choice.  You won't be wasting your money.  The other one's weren't very good, but this one will be awesome.",1142640000,3,777,4.226027397260274

I have seen this movie in Japanese before, and it is AWSOME. I cannot belive this movie just looks so good! With the stunning computer grapics, which have never, EVER been seen in ANYTHING dragonball related, this is the best DBZ movie I have seen in my life!

2466727,4,B000CNGBVW,"Attention Dragon Ball fans!  After a couple of rather lame Broly sequels, boy are you in for a treat.  Everything I've heard about Fusion Reborn is good news.  Here's ten reasons why you should give FR a look:

1. Even though Hell opens up in this movie, Broly is nowhere in sight.  Thank goodness!

2. Frieza comes back to Earth, although at this point, Gohan is probably able to pound him back into Hell with his little finger.  Still, it's a reminder of the early days of DBZ when Frieza was actually scary.

3. Also emerging from the nether regions is another legendary villian, Adolf Hitler (no kidding!), complete with his zombie Third Reich army.

4. Goku's new best friend in the afterlife, Pikkon, comes to lend a hand in the big fight in the spirit world.

5. Leading the fight on Earth is Gohan, who makes his first movie appearance as Saiyaman.  Videl appears as Saiyagirl but doesn't do much except copy Gohan's weird poses.  Oh well.

6. More comic relief stuff from Goten and Trunks.  This time around, they fuse into Gotenks.

7. Still more comic relief stuff from Hercule, who actually does a pretty good job pounding Hitler's zombie army.

8. Which came first, Gogeta or Vegito?  If we're to believe this movie, it's the former.  Soon before Goku and Vegeta fused as Vegito to fight Buu on Earth, they fused as Gogeta in the spirit world to fight this movie's main villian.

9. Oh yeah, the main villian. His name is Janemba but he's a lot like Buu.  Well, O.K., he hatches from a washing machine (LOL) rather than an egg.  But like Buu, he starts out like a big, fat toddler and then turns scary.

10. Broly's not in this one...oops, I think I mentioned that!

Only one more DBZ movie to go, which will probably come out around Christmas 2006.  From what I hear, Movie 13 is great too.  One thing that happens is that Trunks gets his sword (the one he sliced Frieza in half with).",1138752000,3,1899,4.466472303206997
2466728,4,B000CNGBVW,"Let's face it, Dragon Ball GT and the DB/Z movies suck hard.  Yet some of them stick out.  Fusion Reborn! begins like any other Dragon Ball tale.  Everything is peaceful, than something bad happens, and the Goku finds himself fighting some unbeatable foe.  As the battle begins it's terrible as Pikkon and Goku fall.  The battle then becomes desperate and some heart warming scenes.

The artwork is amazing, it is the first of the DBZ movies to be computer animated.  Trust me, it shows.  Janemba is one unique character.  Like Majin Buu, he begins as a fat, childish character.  Also like Buu, when faced with a rivaled power he is forced to become even stronger.  In his 'demon' form he is just that.  Janemba teleports, and Toei takes advantage of the computer animation.  For just about every episode of DBZ, teleporting is just 3 long speed lines, for Janemba however, he deforms and reappears.  A certain Super Saiya-jin looks like an amped up version of Vegeeto.

The artwork is amazing with the exception of one scene.  At the end there is a short gag of the warriors on Earth fighting Hitler, yes Hitler the same exact one.  It is very humorous, they make Hitler what anybody would think of him.  He is loud, abnoxious, and down right annoying.

This movie is supposedly a remake of the Afterlife Tenkaichi Budokai, moved by about one saga due to the fact that Vegeta is there.  This is supposedly ATB because Pikkon and Goku don't know each other or how powerful the other one is.  Another confusing thing about this movie and the timeline, Gohan is on Earth.  Vegeta is in Hell, so Gohan should already be training in the Supreme Kai world.

Also, a group from a movie has a cameo.  And a famous DBZ vilian returns as well.  Anyone who loves the movies will enjoy this scene, and of course the series.",1135296000,6,1812,4.5875

8099599,4,B000CNGBVW,"An accident occurs at the soul check-in station in Other World which causes the dead to walk again. Chaos begins when the Earth is invaded by past enemies and threats such as Frieza and even Hitler. Goku and Pikkon whom are already dead, now living in Other World are sent to check things out; while on Earth, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks battle the undead. -summary

The Dragon Ball Z movies had become the living definition of money grabbers after the 7th movie. Many non fans would actually argue even before that. The movies were severely lacking in creativity and imagination, to where the writers found themselves either resorting to gimmicks or just playing copy and paste with stories. Therefore, I remember coming into this expecting the same thing, which was why I put it off for way over a year after its US release date. When I finally gave it a look; I was surprised with the solid effort as it did manage to work well with its key elements; the action, plot, and even the comedy held my attention to actually consider this a good movie.

The plot follows the same pattern as any DBZ movie; a threat shows up that could destroy the world or even the entire universe, and Goku must face this threat. This time around the culprit of mischief is a mutated being by the name of Janemba whom is completely responsible for the living and dead to collide. Goku engages him in battle which leads to quickly being pushed to his limits. I guess this movie will only be about as great or bad to you all depending on how well DBZ comedy and action jells with you.

The movie constantly flips between Goku's battle and his sons battle with the undead. The latter is completely comedy motivated all the way down to the visuals and it does work at times. I actually laughed a little during Frieza's return, plus the parody on Hitler down to some of his dialog, where he even admits that he should be recruiting these super strong blond guys. It's rare to find a DBZ movie where the comedy can make you do something other than groan. However, it's the serious fighting that will grab everyone's attention. It contains the usual Super Saiyan gimmicks plus Vegeta makes a very predictable appearance. The fighting is fun to watch, but again, the comedy has moments where it shines here as well concerning the Fusion technique.

Although I enjoyed the movie, I will admit that some of the scenes drag and I doubt this is due to multiple watches. I always felt this way about this movie, and even at 48 minutes I wanted it to end. The villain Janemba is the living definition of cookie-cutter, completely lacking any type of personality which is something that had been plaguing the DBZ movies for a very long time, probably after the Return of Cooler. All he does is just grunt and laugh, and that really isn't cool.

The visuals are much better here than in the TV series. The animation is a lot more crisp and vibrant. Although there is a heavy re-use of cels during some combat, there are moments of sharp blows and some type of action choreography. I liked the backgrounds this time too. The Other World where Goku and Janemba battle in has some pretty cool details, such as a rectangular shaped blood pond just floating in mid-air, and a forest made from sharp metallic needles. There are other elements indicating they are fighting in a different world, which is a good change of pace from the usual mountain and vegetation like areas. There is also a second, more manga like style during the comedic living and dead conflict. The designs at times are more cartoony with a darker outline here. I thought it was fine for the most part, but I probably wouldn't have been able to tolerate that had the movie been longer.

The voice acting for the English dub which is the only one I can tolerate, is fine for the most part except at times the dialog can feel awkward, as if the cast are just creating plot holes or something. It just sometimes feels strange. In any case, the usual Funimation suspects show up for the party, with Chris Sabat delivering a solid performance as usual playing Vegeta. Plus I will always admire Kara Edwards range playing both Goten (young boy) and Videl (teenage girl). I would have never noticed it was the same person if not for the credits. The BGM rock score works well with the action, but don't come into this expecting Cooler's Revenge or Broly: Legendary Super Saiyan.

Fusion Reborn is among the better DBZ titles. It actually tries to be a better movie and succeeds. Plus it can probably rope in new fans despite it not really fitting into main continuity. It appears to be taking place at some point during the Fusion Saga, but this is hard to buy into. In any case, if you're a fan of DBZ than check this out. If you're new and heavily interested in DBZ, I recommend starting with the TV series first season, then the Dead Zone movie only if possible. Others with no interest or knowledge, there is far better anime out there to invest your time in.

Pros:Clean visuals, action and comedy that has good moments

Cons:Has its weaker moments too, plus a cookie-cutter baddie",1450310400,,5107,4.566593886462882
