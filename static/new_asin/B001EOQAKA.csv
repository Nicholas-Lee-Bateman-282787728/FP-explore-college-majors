8299127,5,B001EOQAKA,"For the best audio and video quality with the original broadcast English subtitles, look for 'Studio: YA Entertainment' under Product Details. YA Entertainment (YAE) is the licensed US distributor for I Really Really Like You. YAE works from the original master recordings and hires professinal translators for their DVD releases. Each episode runs about 60 minutes. Volume 1 contains Episodes 1-18; Volume 2 contains Episodes 19-34. On a personal note, I have translated many Korean dramas, most recently Personal Taste and Dong Yi, but I Really Really Like You remains my favorite romantic comedy.  The first four episodes are slow, true, but after that the program never lags.  The supporting cast is rock-solid and the program is filled with wit, charm and a true sense of joy and romance.

YAE's subtitles are justifiably considered some of the best in the business.  Although the translators and technicians change from project to project, the quality remains consistent.  As always, YAE offers viewers the finest in Korean television, subtitled by a team of technicians and translators that know their business.
