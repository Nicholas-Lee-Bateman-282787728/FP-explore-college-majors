8693623,5,B00R0BF68S,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The reference to Sergio Leone was so tongue in cheek.  However, I am a huge Ranveer Singh fan.  I think it is worth watching just for the opening song and dance.  I highly recommend this film.",1446681600,,222,4.341463414634147
8693624,4,B00R0BF68S,I love Bollywood and I really liked the film. Govinda has a future as a goonda. He did not get enough dance time however. Ali Zafar was regulated to second place ans he really stole the show in many ways.,1424390400,,204,4.125
8693625,4,B00R0BF68S,"This movie probably won't be noted in film history. Or maybe it will. I don't know. I thought it was goofy, campy, and delicious. I have it for dinner every now-and-then.",1419638400,4,170,4.516129032258065
