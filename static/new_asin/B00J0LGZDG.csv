6308637,5,B00J0LGZDG,"excellent concert based on the ""Strange Highways"" tour.
Has less visual effects than other DIO DVD's and is more about the music.
well worth it for any DIO fan.",1401494400,,160,4.551724137931035
6308638,5,B00J0LGZDG,"I just got this and watched it, and damn I'm blown away by it. This has some of the heaviest music you will hear Dio play. On ""Dont' Talk to Strangers he shows he hasn't lost a thing, he shows his vocal ability in the light parts when the song first starts and at the end and then shows a dominating strong voice the rest of the song. Expect that throughout the show. The band are very energetic, amping it up a notch, and the song selection is excellent, with the expected favs from his career and some great versions of the songs from the Strange Highways cd. This is a great release, if you're a Dio fan you'll love it, if you're a heavy metal fan you'll love it. This belongs in your collection.",1401494400,,699,4.185185185185185
6308639,5,B00J0LGZDG,"A great concert from the Strange Highways era with Tracy G & Jeff Pilson. Very cell played and a must have for any DIO fan. The sound is stunning. It's a shame that the Blu-Ray was not shot in high def, but still this is a great show to remember RJD with.",1400889600,3,255,3.923076923076923
6308640,5,B00J0LGZDG,I've never gotten the complaints on Tracy G. on guitar. He does an awesome job. The band is definitely heavier here as the keyboards are kept to a bare minimum. I've seen a lot of Dio footage through out the years and this is definitely one of the best. Add it to your Dio collection now. You won't be sorry. I know I'm not. Thank you Wendy Dio.,1399939200,17,345,4.088235294117647
6308641,5,B00J0LGZDG,"It doesn't matter what era of his career or which band he played in, I'm always awestruck when I watch Ronnie James Dio perform.  This man was one the top few heavy metal performers to ever live, with both the stage presence and the voice to hold a crowd spellbound for every second of the show.  This concert came at an interesting time in his career to say the least.  Dio's drummer had been Vinny Appice for every one of his albums since Black Sabbath's ""Mob Rules"" until Appice left in 1989.  After Dio released ""Lock Up the Wolves"" without him, RJD ended up rejoining Black Sabbath for the ""Dehumanizer"" album....with Vinny Appice on drums!  When that didn't work out, he restarted the Dio band, again enlisting Vinny as his drummer, just as he had the first time he left Black Sabbath.  The re-re-reunited Dio and Appice teamed with Tracy G, Jeff Pilson, and Scott Warren to release ""Strange Highways,"" the album they were touring during this concert.  To appreciate this DVD, it would help to like ""Strange Highways,"" which provided six songs for the night's set list.  I think the songs all sound great; the band played a blistering set, with many other expected classics besides the six from ""Strange Highways.""  You know you're going to get ""Holy Diver,"" ""Heaven and Hell,"" ""Man on the Silver Mountain,"" ""The Last in Line,"" ""Rainbow in the Dark,"" and all those popular titles with a Dio concert, but to me, every show and every audience is unique, so I'll take any unreleased, quality performances of shows like this they want to put out.  This is not exactly bootleg footage here.  The look and sound on the DVD are excellent, the band was in top form, and the show is entirely worthwhile to have.  It's an awesome concert and another reminder that there will never be another RJD.",1399852800,27,1792,4.653968253968254

6308644,2,B00J0LGZDG,"Yes, it's possible for a Dio concert to get a bad review.  Here's the honest truth as to why:

1.  Dio is clearly getting tired at this point, or at the very lest visibly sick of having to tour with Tracy G, the guitarist who nearly ruined him.
2.  Tracy G.  This guy royally sucks as a guitarist, and my high school bands were better than anything this guy did for Dio.
3.  The sound quality is utterly horrible, and the bass guitar cannot be heard at all.
4.  Video quality is poor, like it was shot on a VHS camcorder.  And it probably was.
5.  ""Previously unreleased"" means ""Because it sucked, but since Dio's dead, maybe we can still make an extra buck"".
6.  Even 300lbs of hair to swing around doesn't make up for how ""garage band"" this band sounds.
7.  No stage show.  If you couldn't see the audience, you'd swear they were playing in a bar.",1472774400,3,849,4.2375
6308645,5,B00J0LGZDG,This was a great lineup for DIO. Scott Warren(Keyboards) Tracy G(Guitar) Jeff Pilson(Bass) Vinnie Appice(Drums) Ronnie James DIO(Vocals). This Blu-Ray has a special feature of the band offstage doing interviews before the show. It's definitely a must have for all DIO fans!!!,1458691200,,275,5.571428571428571

6308652,2,B00J0LGZDG,"Ronnie James (Padavona) ""Dio"" R.I.P.!!!  Is my All-Time Favorite Vocalist-Lyricist (for Heavy Metal Bands, and all bands for that matter) But in my Humble opinion: The Guitarist and the Bassist playing w/ this Incarnation of the Ultra-talented Musical Band Dio, pretty much decimate this Performance.  The vast majority of most-everyone else who rated this DVD seem to have Quite high opinions of it, however, unfortunately the Guitarist is as repulsive physically, as he is musically; at one point he gives the Audience attending the Concert '""The Finger"", undoubtedly attempting to mirror what he was Justifiably seeing from them, directed at him:  His ""industrial style"" is more suited to a non-Metal garage band than it is to be playing w/ the Greatest Vocalist in the History of Heavy Metal, and possibly all of Rock And Roll...  The Bassist is similarly untalented in comparison to the other Bassists with whom R.J.D. (R.I.P.!!!) played; this becomes evident when he attempts to do a solo, backed by the Outstandingly Talented Vinnie (original Dio Band) Drummer.  The 90's sucked for Heavy Metal, and Rock in General; the Bassist & Guitarist are a token of this (sad but true) fact!  Where, oh where, were Craig and Jimmy (R.I.P.!!!) when the Band so Desperately needed them!  This DVD used to be $3.99 for a reason...  Once Again, if only Jimmy (R.I.P.)  and Craig had been with The Band during this performance, it could have been as Golden as Ronnie's Amazing Pipes: Ronnie James acquits himself in Platinum fashion, As Always, on this DVD, but the guitarist and bassist are a cruel and demeaning distraction.  Sorry to be so very down on this Incarnation of The Band, but the Truth must be Told.",1430006400,,1705,4.950877192982456
6308653,3,B00J0LGZDG,"Really low quality picture, but the sound is pretty lame, too.  Good thing I got mine for less than five dollars.  I'd be very upset if I paid ten bucks or more for this.

RJD probably performed the best out of everybody on stage.",1429660800,,230,4.181818181818182
6308654,4,B00J0LGZDG,My favorite vocalist of all time captured Live. Superb concert.,1427414400,,63,5.4
6308655,5,B00J0LGZDG,"Dio in his prime. I like the heavier style and i like the fact that Tracy G did his own thing with the solos. It makes it a bit different which is refreshing on the songs i've heard many times over on other live DVD's. The six songs off the Strange Highways album also keep it interesting. I actually saw this tour in a club called ""The Ritz"" in Ybor city Tampa. It remains one of the best shows i've ever seen.",1427328000,,411,4.024390243902439
6308656,3,B00J0LGZDG,"Love DIO, just not this DVD.  Sound is lame.  Only for diehard fans.  Many more DVD's out there from Ronnie that are 10 times better.",1426550400,,133,4.24
6308657,3,B00J0LGZDG,"This concert was first recorded was recorded before the BluRay format existed, & the video shows that in the clairity of the video. I hoped that the video of the concert had been improved before it was transferred to BluRay. I didn't have any Dio in my concert DVD's, & hoped that the video had been upgraded from the original recording was the reason I purchased it.",1425859200,,367,4.492537313432836
6308658,5,B00J0LGZDG,"Tracy G (Guitar) seems to really polarise DIO fans. They either love or hate him. To my ears, he is the most original guitarist they had, and my Uncle was in a band (U.F.O) with Michael Schenker, so I know guitarists!

This DVD is a superb document of my personal favourite Line-up. The sound mix is excellent, and the repertoire is a well-balanced mix of classic Dio songs, Black Sabbath and Rainbow songs, and material from the 'Strange Highways' LP. Dio himself is in fine form, the man should have been on 'American Idol' showing the kids how to sing...never a 'Pitchy' moment is heard!
Highly Recommended.",1424908800,,610,4.700934579439252

6308660,4,B00J0LGZDG,"1993 Ronnie's voice was still as powerful as ever. Good job of mixing in songs from the Strange Highways cd along with the classics. Only problem with some songs like Children Of The Sea and Heaven And Hell was they were part of a medley and not played in their entirety. The last song on the dvd (Here's To You) skips at times.

The Strange Highways Album was special and I always wanted to see it performed, The Blu-ray is good however more of a letter box on screen, but my tv h-fill cured that. The audio is very good in stereo. I don't have 5.1 and prefer stereo anyways. I was glad it was not 5.1 stereo. Song list is good because it covers songs I have not herd Live before.

I saw him the year before (with Vinny on the BS Dehumanizer tour in Sacramento).but missed this tour. I quite like Tracy G as he puts his own style on all the familiar songs, even flipping the audience off during his awesome solo on 'Holy Diver' as if to say: ""Take that""! If you like Randy Rhoades you will like Tracy G as he has a similar sound! Along with Paice, Powell, Downey (Thin Lizzy) Vinny Appice inspires me to pick up my sticks such is the tasteful power he brings on the Kit! Love his drum fills and, try playing along to 'Hollywood Black' as he plays off beat patterns as well as on the beat...nice stuff! The energy of this show is incedible, Jeff Pilson does great backing vocals and reminds me of Cliff Burton as the 'Dandruff is flyin'!
Scott Warren is on keyboards but is never shown. I wish one of the cameramen would have got a shot of him in his hiding place! This lineup got lost in the times for whatever reason...i missed 'em on tour myself. I hope Wendy Dio finds a show from the following 'Angry Machines' Tour and releases it as well!

What makes this live set special is so many tracks from ""Strange Highways"" so some deep album cuts and not just the hits and is a single source concert where as ""Inferno Last In Live"" from the following album/tour came from multiple sources and relied too heavily on the hits in my opinion.
No frills/special effects just a band that is very hungry and taking no prisoners playing balls out classic heavy metal and some of Ronnie's heaviest material he ever did ""Give me a choice between pleasure and pain........I choose PAIN"" .\m/.RJD.\m/.",1401494400,4,750,4.364285714285714
