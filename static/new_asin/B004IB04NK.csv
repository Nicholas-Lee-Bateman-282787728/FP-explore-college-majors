4385614,5,B004IB04NK,"Dirty Mary/Crazy Larry is an incredible car film, to say the least. Peter Fonda controls himself so well as Larry, the driver, racing, trying to get the hell outta Dodge after robbing a store, and trying to raise money so he can get himself, and his mechanic into NASCAR, and do the good races, like the Indy 500, and others. Mary is his unexpected love interest, who just won't stop pestering him and his mechanic, who try time and again to get rid of her, but just cant. This film is hilarious, exciting, fun, over the top, and just a real good time. Forget the fact that it isn't ""art"" or whatever, cuz to me, it is, in its own way. It gets its job done, and it knows what it is, and it doesn't apologize for it, and its all real, too. No CGI, no nothing, real cars, real crashes, and real stunts.
  Race With The Devil is a very different, yet also incredibly cool movie. You gotta be a fan of seventies/eighties films to really ""get"" and enjoy these films, now I myself am sixteen, which should just go to show you don't have to be an old timer to enjoy these flicks. I really dug RWTD, it was fun, exciting, and actually WAS kinda scary, I'm a pretty big Warren Oats fan, especially after I saw Two-Lane Blacktop a couple years ago, and Peter Fonda is just wonderful. Especially as a second billed film, it was great. And the special feature documentary on RWTD is pretty cool, it's got Fonda in it talking about the production and what not. Anyway, if you dig old-school car films and horror films, check this one out, and for TEN dollars you really cant go wrong, a real treat, rich and exciting, like biting into a candy bar at the drive in, you'll feel like a kid again. :)",1310515200,34,1683,4.289308176100629

4385616,5,B004IB04NK,"It was *great* to have the opportunity to watch this old classic, thanks to Amazon. When it was released here in Brazil, I went to the cinema theatre 3 times, with different friends, in the same week! The last time I saw it, I was at the first row of chairs, and then, felt ""inside"" the cars during the runs. Amazing! The simple fact that I kept its English name (here, it was called ""Fuga Alucinada"") and both Peter Fonda and Susan George names as actors, may tell how much I liked it. Race With the Devil (here named ""Corrida contra o Demnio"") was less appealing, but I liked Warren Oates role. I also liked very much sharing the visions and opinions from Peter Fonda and Susan George in the ""making of"" the film, in the Bonus. I recommend them both, but beware both Sheriffs!, specially Vic Morrow, from Combat TV series.",1308268800,2,824,4.427631578947368
4385617,3,B004IB04NK,"Shout factory seriously need to get their #*@$ together. This is the second time I've received discs mislabled. Dirty Mary/crazy Larry and race with the devil are transposed. The others are Mystery Science Theatre releases;  Master Ninja 1 and 2 are mislablled and Project Moonbase and Sinbad are also transposed. So what the hell is going on with Shout... Bad day at the office... Coffee spilt on the lables What??? Myself and others spend good hard earned money on a product you deem to lable by tossing a coin. Start by checking quality control procceedures and then test the eyesight of those in the production proccess. This is either an example of incredibly low  standards of production or some socialogical experiment designed to piss off or confuse as many people as possible! In this day and age of accountability pay some respect to the people who pay your salary and get the damn thing right. If I wanted to spend money on a circus I'd buy a ticket!

4385618,5,B004IB04NK,"Just gotta say, have been a fan of DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY since seeing it as a kid at the drive-in. In fact, this is the movie that got me to like car chasing movies. But this isn't a movie review, this is the DVD review...and the two movies (split onto two discs-way to go Shout!) look as good as the original DVDs that were released some years ago...in fact, they look a little better in my opinion. Maybe has to do with layers being used, don't know if they are single or dual...but they each look better than the originals. Don't get me wrong, they are no Avatar quality by no means, but for their time and the low budget film stock used, they turned pretty good. And anamorphic widescreen always helps with resolution.
The special features look to be carried over from past transfers and the sound is nothing to write home about...but to get these two Peter Fonda classics in one package for around ten bucks, it's a steal!
Shout! is doing pretty good work on their releases and this is another good one!

Here it is two years later and Shout finally releases these on blu ray! And the blu ray is cheaper than the DVD I purchased a few years ago. And the blu rays blow away the DVDs. As much as I love Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry I am glad I double dipped. If you have the chance, grab this on blu ray. The format keeps proving to me that it is MUCH better than standard DVD (no matter how old the movie).",1306195200,26,1766,4.886666666666667

Peter Fonda stars in it as well.

So two great movies for a really good price.

what a great lady, check her out two years later in ""A Small Town In Texas"" which was directed by Jack Stewartt the
same guy who directed ""Race With The Devil"" and he makes a cameo appearance in both films!  These are both
great American Film making.  Simple but different and so American.  Peter Fonda cool and also see him in 1977's ""OutLaw Blues""

Peter fonda who plays Larry a thief & NASCAR race car driver looking to score quick cash
and British actress Susan George who plays an American Groupie Mary who takes ride with Larry
not bad American accent from British actress Susan George, susan tries who best to portray an American Groupie

Race with the Devil, where 2 old friends Roger & Frank played by Peter fonda & Warren oates
takes their wives played by Lara parker & Loretta swit & go on a road trip with there RV to Aspen Colorado from San Antonio Texas
on the way to Colorado Roger & Frank decide to take a short cut through Texas to cut the Drive shorter
they endup in Central Texas near Austin where they stay the night
while staying the night Roger and Frank witness a Satanic sacrifice across the river by looking through their Binoculars
they report the incident to the Local sheriff from the small town they're in
Frank & Roger later find out the whole towns population are Satan worshippers including the sheriff
and also find out that the 4 of them are targets for the towns next Satanic sacrifice.
very well Directed supernatural thriller with lots of Witchcraft in the story

2 low budget 70's Action thrillers that were previously released by Anchor bay dvd over 10 years ago now
have now been re-issued on blu-ray by Shout factory on 1 blu-ray Disc
and tell you what both HD transfers of both films look excellent in 1:78:1 widescreen
 Shout factory made the effort with the picture quality for both films for sure
both films do look much sharper & clearer than the old Anchor bay version
unfortunately i cannot say the same has been done for the sound quality thou
both films have Master audio stereo mix only which sounds Good but not excellent
if a 5.1 Master audio was added the sound quality would be boosted for sure, both films would sound alot better
especially on a surround sound system no Doubt about it
but the picture quality for both films definitely has been cleaned up, it's better quality than the old Anchor bay release anyway

Shout factory have also carried over the special features from the old Anchor bay release aswell
RIDE THE WILD SIDE-30mins featurette which is interviews with
Director John Hough, Actors Peter Fonda & Susan George give their comments on working/making the film
plus an Audio commentary with Director John Hough
very informative commentary aswell, John talks about some of the cast in film, Susan George, Roddy McDowall etc
talks about the locations
there's also Theatrical trailer, TV spots & Radio spots
all taken from the old Anchor bay dvd
same with Race with the Devil
every single extra from the Race with the Devil DVD which is just a retrospective featurette plus an Audio commentary
the featurette is another interview with Peter fonda only
Lara parker & Loretta swit are not interviewed for some reason
the commentary is with executive producer Paul maslansky and Actress Lara parker
very informative Audio commentary & worth listening to for sure
Paul gives alot of comments about the Director & the casting of the film
Lara gives very Detailed retrospect comments on who acting role in the film

so scrap the old Anchor bay release, definitely time to upgrade and buy this new Blu-ray reissue
4 stars i gave it, i would give it 5 stars if a new 5.1 Master audio mix was added but tragically there isn't
so you would have to tolerate the Master stereo mix",1427932800,6,3432,4.666115702479339

The video and audio are both excellent transfers, but not a lot can be done to improve the original mono audio soundtracks. BOTTOM LINE: If you own a blu-ray player and loved these great Peter Fonda flicks back in the day, you cannot go wrong with this purchase.",1389398400,2,496,4.276595744680851
4385901,4,B004IB04NK,"DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY basically plays like the actors were strapped into a car going like a bat and just ad-libbed the entire movie as they went. Famous show-stopper ending gives this a twist that helped make the film memorable. Performances are loose, at best, and truly nothing to rave about. The short Making Of featurette basically confirms that much of the film's dialogue was, in fact, improvised by the actors, with only general plot ideas to guide them. Easily the least of these two films, IMHO.

RACE WITH THE DEVIL starts out well enough and then quickly turns into a homicidal, paranoia-fueled, nightmare ride! It's one of those films where you find yourself yelling at the characters to NOT do this or DO that because, unlike them, you've seen this kind of situation before in other films and know they're headed for trouble but you want to see them make it through safely. Surprisingly, this movie actually gets better as it rolls along. The stunt work is ambitious, amazingly intense and very well-done for a low budget drive-in film. Good performances all around in this one. The ending was the only really ""bad"" part of the movie, for me. Still, even with the downer (yet somehow still sort of vaguely open-ended) finale, I enjoyed this film. It was an engrossing road trip from, to, and thru Hell.

This Blu-ray is well-presented and a really good bargain. The print transfers look quite good for both movies and the video & audio are strong & solid, with crisp colors, sharp focus and clear sound. Extras include trailers for both, plus each film has a newly-shot Making Of mini feature going into detail about the films. A nice touch that sadly isn't done enough on older, obscure films like these. I liked them both. 3 stars for DIRTY MARY, CRAZY LARRY and 5 stars for RACE WITH THE DEVIL... so I split the difference and gave this double feature Blu-ray 4 stars.",1388966400,11,1886,4.712121212121212

4385931,5,B004IB04NK,"Though this film may be considered 'cheesy', at the time that it came out Satanic cult activity was a big concern and making the news.  I really enjoyed the 'road race' as it kept you on the edge of your seat.  Having snakes pop out of cupboards in the motor-home was also a hoot.  Warren Oates is a great actor and made the film worth watching.  For a cult classic, I would highly recommend this film to others.",1359504000,,412,4.243589743589744
