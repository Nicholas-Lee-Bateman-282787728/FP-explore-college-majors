He got to have sex with (cover with mayonnaise and then rape) the love of his life, and then have a threesome with a blind girl! To make it more interesting, he meets a cross-dressing salaryman who takes him to a cult party where he meets an onee-san (older woman) with abandonment issues and then gets shot in the hand! For Kanou, this is no big deal, because the world is going to end and he's going to enjoy himself to the fullest!",1389139200,5,572,4.070796460176991
5391737,5,B00A705N82,"Starts slow , but a good movie should. This was well paced and you get to know more about the main character and his life before the plot of the movie begins. It may seem like a bad review, but I don't want to give anything away. I Loved it ! It has some T and A . One scene was odd "" But "" funny... It'll make ya think about mayo in a different way :)",1382918400,,352,3.5844155844155843

5391739,5,B00A705N82,This is one great movie. I totally enjoyed the story; the acting. Just hose to prove that Japanese movies are just as good as any other country. Definatelly recommend this movie!,1374624000,,178,4.774193548387097
5391740,1,B00A705N82,The end of the world means the guy gets to kidnap a girl and force her to have sex with him?  Sick!!!,1372550400,,101,3.590909090909091
5391741,1,B00A705N82,the plot was ok but acting and filming was horrible. I felt like I wasted time watching this. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it,1371600000,,132,4.115384615384615
5391742,3,B00A705N82,"This movie has a few funny moments but I found the ending to be lacking.
The entire time I watched it, I wondered how the world would end and the movie doesn't follow thru in that premise.",1368403200,,188,4.108108108108108
5391743,5,B00A705N82,"Obviously, having just watched the entire thing through should not qualify it for 5 stars, right?  WRONG!  No, wait, you are right.  This movie reminded me of Donny Darko, which wouldn't qualify it for five stars either.  But, where Donny Darko is moody and cinema-graphic, The Last Days of the World is shot in a perfunctory and basic manner, which is another crazy choice, given the occasional forays into fantasy.  It has elements of ""Natural Born Killers,"" if Tarantino and Oliver Stone were switched out with Bukowski and Cassavetes.  But still, an art film?  Dada?  I don't think so.

The music, or the soundtrack is as curious as the film itself.  It begins with a very familiar and cliche' harmonica based ""movie music,"" that gets absorbed by dissonant guitars.

This movie, and what makes it so watchable is that it repeatedly makes the same old promises of magic realism, but it fulfills the promises with nihilistic realism.  There is no detectable eroticism in the sex scenes, and the violent scenes are not sensationalized, if anything they are anti-sensational, which adds to this nihilist realism that answers the ever expanding promises of magic realism.

The acting is shockingly strong, and throughout the narrative, you connect with the characters in a very honest way.

I don't really know what else to add.  It has a lot of what I may call, Japanese hangups, themes that revolve around rape, social bullying, highschool, and food, but the answers  to these tropes are new and refreshing.  The scenes where the lead character is confronted with unreal situations just reinforce the suffocation that is making his life so upsetting.  It is very hard to predict what will happen next, but by the end, you see that within the central truth of the film, everything moves along a surprisingly realistic arc.  In a world where the best you can do is attend a top tier university and work a s***ty corporate job, losing your mind may be the only option worth pursuing.  It's pretty serious stuff, handled with skill that you may not even notice if you were just waiting to see a Japanese ""Natural Born Killers.""

Of course there was stuff I didn't like, but I don't think I would've changed anything. That is saying a lot because I always want to change everything in a film.

So that is why I gave it five stars.  I think if you watch it, and it doesn't make you puke, you will appreciate what it is saying about society, middle age and youth, and the internal crisis that occurs when the individual chooses to break with societal norms.  But you may just puke, as well.  There's my two cents.",1365897600,6,2607,4.7272727272727275
5391744,4,B00A705N82,"Apparently dada'ism has not died.  I consider that a good thing.  Yea... it doesn't make a whole lot of since.  But if you enjoy some dada in your life, then you won't likely care.  The film doesn't take itself too seriously and has some pretty funny parts.  Probably wouldn't hurt to be a little drunk when watching this.",1362787200,2,322,4.482758620689655
5391745,1,B00A705N82,It was so boring I could not watch it all so I can not give a good review.  How can you use enough words to post a review when you have nothing good to say about it.,1361836800,3,165,3.4594594594594597
8547590,2,B00A705N82,"If you enjoy movies in which all of the characters are unlikable over-the-top nutjobs, then you'll probably enjoy this film.  I don't, and I didn't.  I kept waiting for it to get better but that never happened.",1526515200,,210,4.648648648648648
8547591,4,B00A705N82,"A nutsy Japanese movie, fun to watch. But in the end is it a dream or real?",1470787200,,75,3.4705882352941178
8547592,3,B00A705N82,Interesting movie. You'll never look at mayonnaise the same again lol,1468627200,,69,5.363636363636363

8547594,1,B00A705N82,"Are you serious?  I have a Japanese family, and we have lived in Japan for more than 30 years.  This is the absolute most insane movie I've ever seen, and it depicts Japanese society as crazed and lunatic.  I did watch it all the way through, because some had written that it was worth 5 stars... now I am beginning to think they must be like the main actor in this film.

I only give it one film, because somebody had to go through the trouble of making it, and for that I give a star.  Otherwise, it's just wow.",1453075200,,513,4.09
8547595,2,B00A705N82,It was not really good movie. I didn't enjoy it.,1427068800,,48,3.9
8547596,5,B00A705N82,"Seen it twice; almost forgot. LOL.  It's a fun, disturbing, realistic though fantastical film.  Outrageous, very Japanese in a sense.  Funny, almost too simplistically real (japanese again!!) sexualized scenes.  Bizarred storyline with an insane main character.  Family scenes are hilarious; school scenes reminiscent of typical nippon high school a la Blood Royale.  Worth the time so see it.",1426204800,,393,5.689655172413793

8547598,2,B00A705N82,"The movie is entertaining and fast-paced, at first, but after one character dies and is left on the side of the road, the whole movie does.  After that it is nothing more than stagnant stupidity, with the main character running into one predictably 'zany' person after another, while nothing happens.  Don't watch.",1416182400,,314,5.019230769230769
8547599,5,B00A705N82,A true masterpiece. A wild ride. Great film. Me and my friends were glued to the screen waiting to see what happened next. An adventure of letting go of all social worries and just doing what you've always wanted.,1414886400,,213,4.487179487179487
