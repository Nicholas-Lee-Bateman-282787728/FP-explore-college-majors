8237997,5,B0010KI0VU,"Jimmy made his living appearing in many of these early television plays in the very early days of television when it was produced out of New York (where the advertising agencies were in charge).  The Dark, Dark Hours was made after he had appeared in East of Eden and just before he completed Rebel.  The actor playing his buddy in Dark, Dark Hours had a small role in Rebel and was also something of an assistant to Jim.

What a hoot to see Jimmy play opposite the man who would eventually become Governor of California and President of the U.S.  Reagan at that time might still have been President of the Screen Actors Guild, and a Democrat.  Reagan made a living also as the Spokesman for various products on radio and later television.  He appeared as the program sponsors spokesperson to remind the viewer their product was paying for the evenings entertainment.

James Dean and Natalie Wood were very young and it shows in ""I'm a Fool"".  Natalie still a teen and Dean only 22, looks even younger.  Dean is perfectly cast as a young boy straight off the farm, plays the naive little show-off just right.  It's almost like watching a school play.  Loved Eddie Albert as the narrator.  This was made before East of Eden or Rebel.",1339718400,,1232,4.575342465753424

8237999,5,B0010KI0VU,"I got this DVD for the Dark, Dark Hours (already had I'm a Fool because that's easy to find).  You see a different character for JD to play and he dances a bit too...and he could definitely dance good haha.  JD plays a guy who takes his friend to a doctor's place (Ronald Reagan) middle of the night because his friend has been shot.  Let's just say there are some tense moments in the story when a gun gets involved.  Every James Dean fan should own this.  Well worth the price-you won't regret it if you choose to purchase it!",1242777600,,528,4.24
