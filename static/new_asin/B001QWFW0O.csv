Serio-Comedic Masterpiece  5*

I LOVE THIS FILM.  I viewed it last night and plan to go back and watch it again in the very near future, but I'll give it a review while it's still fresh from the first experience.  The interconnections between the characters are complex, and will definitely repay repeated viewing.

I should emphasize that in spite of the English title, it is not primarily a film ""about"" prostitution, nor is it an exploitation flick -- though there are ""sexual situations"", if there was any nudity I've forgotten it. [Added note on second viewing: OK, we get the unclothed torsos of male customers a couple of times, but remember these are guys who can't get a free date.  The 'girls,'  though, make a point of not stripping.]  (I should warn parents, though, that there is racy language in a few places, and there are a couple of scenes where the prostitutes are with customers, but almost formalized, head and clothed shoulders.)  What it is is a laugh-out-loud comedy (seriously, I like to bust a gut at points) but also with serious story lines about people in realistic situations, even political commentary.  The story involves the intertwined lives of four main characters:

Lai Chung-chung (pop singer Prudence Liew, aka Lau Mei-Guan; thanks to IMDB for the cast info), a streetwalker with bad teeth who stumbles around on ridiculous high heels and is devoted to the pen of chickens she keeps.  Though she's a heroin addict, kind of  ditzy even when not zoned out, she's  also rather sweet (though not the stereotyped ""heart of gold"") and just trying to get by.

Wong Lin-fa (Race Wong, also  pop singer), pregnant with twins, and one child already, come from the mainland to claim ""right of abode"" after her HK resident husband's death.  Lin is feisty, even shrill, searching for whatever money she can from her husband's estate or the government.

Lau Fu-yi (Athony Wong Chau-Sang) is an insurance agent with a heart of gold who goes way beyond the call of customer service.  He pays the fee for a broke client, who soon dies, and when he is trying to sell a policy to Lin, becomes involved in her quest for residence and her pregnancy.  Whenever he meets a new person, or his evaluation of someone changes, we see his estimation of the policy he can sell typed on the screen (something like ""Brilliant photographer, $2,000,000""  then, whoops, ""Artsy photographer who will pay to shoot, $2,000"").

Chi (Sammy Leung) is a handsome young photojournalist who eventually takes to chronicling the life of Chung, along with his (editor? reporter?) friend.

Then there are the other hookers who hang out on the same corner as Chung; the glamorous mainland doctor, Dr. Lee, who gives lectures at Lau's agency and whom he pursues; Chung's steady client and old friend, Keong, who says he'd marry her except that all his buddies have slept with her also, and is about to get married to a mainland girl; Sister Kot, the pretty young nun acting as social worker among the prostitutes; and so forth.

The prime plot lines seem to involve -- Chung, who suddenly realizes this is a ""dragon year"", and determines to turn her life around, beginning with earning enough money to fix her teeth.  As she nears her goal, and makes tearful phone calls only to hang up when they are answered, we begin to get a glimpse of her past life and traumas.  Lin, who becomes more and more pregnant as her quest for solvency and residency progresses.  And Chi, who goes from opportunistic observer out to ""get the story"" to actually empathizing with his subject.  Mr. Lau is the glue who binds these threads together, and has his own storyline pursuing the glamorous Dr. Lee and possibly expanding his insurance efforts to the mainland.

There is also some commentary on, or at least use of, the Hong Kong / China political situation, primarily the ""right of abode"" or residence, the complicated relation between the mainland and the former British colony.  Some is as simple as the HK hookers kvetching about the mainland girls who charge so much less, but some is more in your face, like the TV coverage of rallies demanding the right (though it's not clear who is demanding).  It's a near constant subtext for the film.  Even  the literal translation of the title is in a way political, ""My body isn't up for sale, but my uterus is"", which contrasts the lives of Chung, who merely sells her body, and Lin, who has ""sold"" her uterus (through marriage) to achieve her dream of HK residence and wealth (of course her husband was not the wealthy man he pretended to be).

In summary, an enjoyable film which will alternately have you exploding with laughter then wiping a tear from your eye.  But all's well as ends well, and the film winds to a satisfying and warm conclusion.  Serio-comic here, not tragi-comic.  I plan to watch this again very, very soon, and to hunt up as many of Mr. Yau's other 50-odd films as I can find, in particular the previous year's ""Whispers and Moans,"" supposedly in some sense a prequel to this one.",1293840000,,5082,4.719954648526077
