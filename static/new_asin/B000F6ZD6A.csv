8118195,1,B000F6ZD6A,"I previously gave this a great rating, but I was thinking of another DVD I just purchased.  The ease of purchase and rapid delivery of The History of Lourdes were good, but I did not like the DVD at all.  This DVD was clearly biased against the validity of the entire Lourdes experience, challenging even well established facts.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone.",1395878400,,371,4.590909090909091
8118196,5,B000F6ZD6A,"I had watched this show, but wanted my own copy for future reference.  The seller was great.  Quick ship and no complaints.",1275868800,,123,4.545454545454546
8118197,4,B000F6ZD6A,"I think this is an interesting documentary.
But I'd recommend you also buy one of the following movies: ""Bernadette"" or ""The Song of Bernadette"".
These movies will give you an even better insight in what exactly happened over there in Lourdes to Bernadette.",1267574400,3,257,5.0
