5374031,5,B009ZBS67O,"Walking The Halls is a Lifetime movie I think, and I liked it for the same reasons that I liked Showgirls and the Poison Ivy series. It is provocative, entertaining and stars strong, sexy females. It also has some sexy guys in it. I highly recommend Walking The Halls if you like Lifetime movies, or are fans of the aforementioned movies.",1419984000,,338,4.557377049180328

5374033,4,B009ZBS67O,High school senior Casey(Jamie Luner) finds herself seduced into the fast lifestyle of a call girl ring run by a campus police officer and must pull herself out before she loses all self-control.,1391644800,,195,4.9393939393939394
5374034,2,B009ZBS67O,"Casey (Caitlin Thompson) has a heartbreaking rift with her boyfriend Jeremy (Isiah Adams). Afterwards, in her moment of weakness, she is recruited into a high school prostitution ring by three other girls (Marie Avgeropoulos, Lindsay Taylor, Arden Cho). The ring is run by Jack (Matthew Alan) the school security guard. Casey is reluctant at first, but when her parents decide to divorce and mom becomes screenplay broke, Casey decides the money is not that dirty.

Casey poses some problems which leads to a culmination of bad script writing and an inane ending. This appears to be a Lifetime movie which accounts for the boredom you get while watching.

5374037,3,B009ZBS67O,"The acting of most of the people is fine. The story line is actually not bad as entertainment but way over the top. SPOILER The guy grabs his gun because his underage, high school, first time, hooker was confused by a john? Seriously? That is just way too goofy. He is going to shoot a 17 year old for being naive? Then there is the old husband who says, Remember when we were her age, to his wife? You are clearly at least 15 years older than the actress who plays your wife so it's a little unbelievable. (Now that IMDb/Amazon has shut down it's message boards it's hard to discuss movies anywhere. I gave it 3 stars for the acting.",1488844800,,634,4.24793388429752

I found myself watching the whole thing and staying awake, so that has to count for something. The actress' are very pretty, but they do appear older than being in high school. It's not a bad film, but it's also not a great film. I would say in short it is a good film to watch if you are needing something different.",1477612800,5,463,4.0989010989010985

5374100,4,B009ZBS67O,I had the lowest expectations for this movie which is why I liked it. The story line is actually well developed for the main girl to give her good motivations for her actions. It's a very interesting tale and believable in how girls can easily be manipulated into situations that quickly get out of hand. Only checked it out because Arden Cho was in it. Funny at times too.

5374164,3,B009ZBS67O,"This has Lifetime movie network written all over it.  The intrusive, paranoid, poor me, mother makes this movie way too predictable.  Nothing surprising comes out of this movie and at times it moves along really slow.  The acting is fine though.  Nothing really special going on with this movie, would not recommend for anyone to watch.",1464134400,14,336,4.946428571428571

8545638,5,B009ZBS67O,"Usually I say I would add a half star if possible, but in this case I would like to reduce a half star.  So four and a half stars.  The acting was really good for people I've never seen before.  The script was a little above average being not too basic.  The plot and the story were good, and I thought most of the events played out in a realistic fashion.  there was some cheesy chase scene that looked like a scene from a tv series in the nineties.",1508025600,,450,4.01123595505618
8545639,1,B009ZBS67O,So Unrealistic and predictable. For once it would be nice if they had a happy ending to the madness. Like let's say Ma becomes her sugar daddy and pays for her to go to school. They fall in love and she becomes a successful CEO. What's so wrong with an ending like that? It's way more realistic.,1507161600,,295,4.192982456140351
8545640,2,B009ZBS67O,"Don't like the story - Production was good, very good casting, everything about the movie was good.
The telling of the story was even done very well.
It's the story itself I don't like but it happens & people are trafficing people everyday.",1506384000,,240,4.604651162790698
8545641,4,B009ZBS67O,"Pretty predictable,, but a good watch. Acting was better than I was expecting. The years haven't been kind toJamie Luner, but somewhere along the way she must have taken some acting lessons,,because she played a good role. I wouldnt put this at the top of my watch list,,, but it was entertaining
Give it a try when your just looking to be entertained for a few hours",1505865600,,367,4.492537313432836
8545642,3,B009ZBS67O,"This is a pretty standard Lifetime style movie (unless it is Lifetime). There's nothing terrible unique or interesting, but it's mildly entertaining when you're bored or just need some noise.

The story is extremely predictable. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. That didn't kill the interest, though. The mother character was annoying and definitely not an intelligent character, and the father, self-absorbed. I half expected him to find out by seeking out a prostitute and accidentally having his daughter show up, that's how lowly he is as a character. The main character was mildly sympathetic, but... again, it's all mild.

There's nothing to hate, but nothing to love with this movie. It's Just Okay.",1505692800,,715,5.155172413793103
