3122316,5,B00144IG7A,"I love the show Reba and i wanted to buy the seasons for a while now. I did not want to pay $30 a season like they are listed in many stores i went to. I went on amazon and it had them for $20 each and that was reasonable but when i went to buy it they had all four seasons together for this great price! They arrived packaged together and to any tv box set collector or any tv show lover, its a great feeling to have ALL the seasons come at once.
The show of course is amazing. I recommend getting all seasons at once like i did, it saves money and instantly, your collection is complete.",1209859200,5,589,3.9166666666666665
3122317,5,B00144IG7A,This will make you laugh and cry all the way through each programme. I bought all sesries and you could watch them over and over. it is a situation where the man of the divorced couple gets married again. The new woman idolizes the last wife and everyone gets on well but so much kind and appropriate sarcasm gets thrown around. It is never rude or in bad taste and so many life lessons are bought out and always 1 in each epeisode. I could see this situtaion happening in real life and that is why it is so funny. But yes i do ususlly cry too because of the realness of the situations. Excellent. A+++ and i watch all kinds of programmes but this is so good to just chill out and relax. Clean sense of humour.,1208563200,12,710,4.1521739130434785

3122334,5,B00144IG7A,"Shows like ""Reba"" should last much longer than 6 years.  Everything about it was PERFECT...the casting, the script, the humor, the realism.  Everything was PERFECT, except for its life span.  This is truly a ""one in a million""!  Can't wait to receive the 5th season, I just pre-ordered it.  Hopefully #6 will come soon after.

To the REBA Cast & Crew, if you happen to read this, I want to personally thank each and everyone of you for all that you contributed in creating such a GEM!  All of you have been blessed with incredible talent!",1224201600,,538,4.541666666666667

It says disc one on the cover, and on the actual CD but when you put the disc it, it is really disc 3. And there is also another disc 3 in the package. So I am missing disc 1 of season two. I have no previewed the third and fourth seasons yet. So I'm hoping they are all the correct discs. Is there anything I can do about the missing disc for season 2?",1220400000,,465,3.66

I have a rather stressful occupation, and when I need to unwind, I pop in a DVD and watch an episode or two.  I think the creator(s) of the show have a great mix of conflict, humor, and resolution in each episode.  I love the interaction between the generations of the family--including the blended family of Brock and BJ.

These shows represent the ""best case scenario"" of today's family--marriage, divorce, teen-pregnancy, teen marriage, remarriage, step-parent, new half-sibbling, etc.  Very well done!",1217808000,,592,5.24468085106383

3122352,5,B00144IG7A,I never watched Reba when it first came on but now is comes on a cable station at 8:00 & I found it one evening when I was channel surfing. I thought it was a really cute show & really got to like it so I bought all 4 seasons & I am so glad I did. If you are watching the reruns & like it do buy all 4 seasons. The first season tells you just how everything started about how Reba's husband got his tect. preg. And it goes from there but it is a comedy,1215561600,,452,3.622448979591837

3122354,5,B00144IG7A,"In the Fall of 2007, we moved to a new state.  After a few weeks I really got homesick and wanted to move back to my old home.  Before I moved to the new house I was in the habit of watching ""Reba"" each evening from 6-7 p.m. and again 8-9 p.m.  After finding the station that Reba came on in our new home, I started watching her again and found myself feeling better and not so homesick.  I don't know what I would have done without the reruns of Reba to watch.  The only problem, was I wanted to watch her WHEN I wanted to watch her.  When I saw Amazon had the best buy of Reba's DVDs I didn't hesitate to place my order.
Now, I can laugh and cry and watch Reba anytime I choose.  It was the best investment I've made in a long time.  Just asked my husband.
