7010708,5,B00TJ30A04,"One of the ten best science-fiction programs ever made for television. Before you buy this box set, there are a few things you should know. The discs are dual layer to ensure the highest quality from the original archival elements. ZIV-Television produced the series on the cheap, but was among the first studios to produce television in color. But this was a cheap color process. Ever seen THE CISCO KID? You get the idea. Don't expect vibrant colors. Red may be pink. The series was syndicated which means there is no true national airdate. A station in New York City might have aired the program on Monday evenings under sponsorship of a beer company. Another station in Los Angeles may have aired the program on Wednesday evening under sponsorship of a cigarette firm. Truman Bradley was filmed for custom commercials for various sponsors and those film shorts are rare and difficult to come by. They were produced to cinch a sponsorship deal.

Ivan Tors produced the series. Most of the stories originated from articles from SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, of which you can see one issue on Truman Bradley's desk. The second season was not renewed on all the stations that carried the first season, but certainly enough to warrant production under one cost-cutting consideration: the second season would be shot in black and white. This is why the second season will be black and white and the first season shot in color.

Many of the props are leftover from Tors' movie productions, GOG and THE MAGNETIC MONSTER. This sort of trivia I learned from a book titled SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE by Martin Grams (http://www.amazon.com/SCIENCE-FICTION-THEATRE-HISTORY-TELEVISION/dp/1593936575/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1428515094&sr=8-8&keywords=science+fiction+theater+book) and it is available from Amazon.com. I recommend you buy the book and the DVD as they compliment each other and you'll learn all you need to know about the TV series.",1428451200,224,1923,5.301639344262295
7010709,5,B00TJ30A04,"This series was made back in a time when people thought the future would be better than the present.

A look back on more optimistic times. Today, most people accept a ""Steady grind down"".  I enjoy the introductions in each episode, an attempt was made to try and demonstrate the practicality of the futuristic story about to be shown.  Many of the inventions shown in this series would never pass government regulators today.  Nevertheless, good entertainment and good fun.

I'm a little concerned about the video quality considering how many episodes will be on each disc. I enjoy this show so much I will take a chance.",1427760000,12,622,4.775700934579439
7010710,5,B00TJ30A04,"Since we seem to be reviewing this one EVEN BEFORE IT COMES OUT, I guess I'll join in.  I've purchased several ""classic TV"" boxed sets produced by Timeless Media from Amazon over the past few years.  IMHO, the viewing quality can best be described as ""good enough,' considering what they have to work with.  Sometimes the audio isn't that great and the video can occasionally be flawed; however, all-in-all one has to realize that they're not working with an original 21st Century production base with these old TV series from the 1950s and the 1960s.  I've got a pretty good memory, and I don't recall them being that much more viewable when they were first run back when.  What makes releases like Science Fiction Theater so valuable to Boomers like me is the nostalgia factor.  For that reason alone, this item - and all the others I've purchased (i.e., Sea Hunt, Mr. Lucky, Checkmate, Whirlybirds, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, and more) - get FIVE STARS from me right out of the chute.",1424995200,55,991,4.699421965317919
7010711,5,B00TJ30A04,"Back in the Fifties, we had all those wonderful science fiction movies with ceatures from outer space, we read up about them in Famous Monsters of Filmland, EC Comics had Weird Science and Weird Fantasy, ACG Comics had Adventures Into The Unknown and Forbidden Worlds, DC Comics had Strange Adventures. Science Fiction Theatre was one of the earliest anthologies on television, so this DVD is a much welcome treat, like going back into the Fifties.

UPDATE - May 12
Just received my copy and did a quick scan of disc 1 - Great picture quality and nice color - collectors will definitely be thrilled with this set!!!!! Discs 1-3, 5-7 are 260 minutes each, Discs 4,8 are 244 minutes each. Titles for the episodes are listed on each disc.

Typically, the story lines related to the life or work of scientists, engineers, inventors and explorers. The program concentrated on such concepts as space flight, robots, telepathy, flying saucers, time travel, and the intervention of extraterrestrials in human affairs. The first season was filmed in color, but to cut costs the second season was in black & white.

7010712,1,B00TJ30A04,"Ivan Tors' SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE (Syndicated 1955-57) finally being made available on DVD is a connoisseur classic tv series collector's dream come true.

However in the typically Timeless Media cost cutting stinginess fashion a full two seasons' worth of 78 episodes each running 26 minutes complete will be crammed onto a mere 8 discs.  Assuming that these will be single-sided pressings then the first 6 discs will contain no less than 10 episodes apiece.  Surely this is stretching things to guaranteed disaster by severely compromising image resolution clarity and further hazarding definite technical defects in the playback.

Considering that the video transfers will be taken from unrestored badly timeworn and abhorently faded colour source elements (at least for the first season) which have deteriorated through irresponsible neglect over the long years the viewing quality will be substandardly poor at best.

In the light of all these realities this ill-conceived low caliber set can be only recommended to the show's most devout enthusiasts who certainly deserve a lot more than this lamentable non-effort.

For myself SCIENCE FICTION THEATRE will disappointingly have to remain a pleasant albeit dimly vague memory until something much better comes along.

I have watched all of the first season at this point and I have to say its a very enjoyable show. It is much different in tone than the Twilight Zone, in that it is not about twists or surprises for the most part. Rather, it is trying to tell 1950s hard sci-fi stories on a limited budget. As a fan of classic sci-fi literature, I found that very compelling.  Not every show is a classic by any means, but all are at least watchable and some are quite compelling.  If this era of TV or Sci-FI interests you I expect you will find this a worthy purchase for the price.",1515801600,,720,4.027972027972028
7010716,5,B00TJ30A04,It was thrilling to find this series on DVD -- and at a reasonable price. Now I am able to recreate the experiences I had as a child watching this series on TV. A unique feature of this series is that each episode begins with an interesting brief demonstration of the scientific principle forming the basis of the story. It is fascinating to see that some of the same themes are being explored today. Often the technology is essentially the same as it was 60 years ago -- the devices have just become smaller and faster. Highly recommended for anyone interested in science fiction as well as how it was depicted in the mid-1950s.,1513123200,,629,4.526315789473684
7010717,5,B00TJ30A04,"Until about a month ago, I had no idea that this set was available, but there it was, for sale at a local store, so I grabbed it. And am I glad that I did!

I first saw Science Fiction Theatre on WPIX Channel 11 here in New York in the 1960s, where it would run -- if memory serves -- on Sunday nights. Many years later, it was shown on the Sci-Fi Channel late on Friday nights, alongside other early science fiction-oriented anthology shows such as Lights Out, and I appreciated it even more at that time, as I was more aware of sources and personnel and credits.

This set from Timeless Video is one of their better productions, and while I haven't gotten though the whole body of viewing yet, what I have seen is eminently satisfying, especially when one allows for the fact that only a finite amount of money is available to devote to the production of collections such as this.

The sources look about the same as those used for the Sci-Fi Channel presentations, perhaps one generation better, and there has been an effort to provide complete versions of episodes. The color shows for season one (season two was in black-and-white, as the budget for the series had to be cut) still have uneven tones from shot to shot, but that's par for the course for early color television, and some of the images are so sharp, that they create almost an illusion of 3-D photography at times, especially in the credit sequences.

As with other releases from this company, there is a trailer plugging other TV-related titles at the front end of each disc, but it's easy to skip this and go directly to the menu, which is simple to use and allows the selection of individual episodes. The series itself will not be to all tastes, the pacing -- even of the best of these half-hour time-slot episodes -- feeling very leisurely by modern standards. But if technology-inspired sci-fi (a la early Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, and Bradbury) is your interest, these can be provocative shows, especially given the era in which they were done -- it's a little less ""science"" fiction than speculative fiction about science, but it's all worth viewing, with some great credits behind it -- not just some of the directors (Jack Arnold comes to mind, and there is a direct connection between the third episode, ""No Food For Thought,"" and the same director's feature film TARANTULA) and actors, but the writers of the underlying stories, which include Jack Finney (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Time And Again) and Stanley G. Weinbaum (""The Adaptive Ultimate"").

And most important, it's all great fun, not only as sci-fi entertainment -- albeit paced in a more leisurely manner than we're used to today -- but as a sociological and cultural document of its time. It's easy to forget, looking at some of the dated sensibilities embodied in some of these scripts and the way they're approached, that this was considered a very high quality, high-class iteration of the science-fiction genre at the time that it was produced, far more so than most of the movies that defined the genre for most of us.",1511308800,,3072,4.681481481481481

7010724,5,B00TJ30A04,"Each story is approximately 26 minutes they pose a problem and a solution. The solution may not be related to the science fiction project presented by the host, Truman Bradley. Truman Bradley played Capt. Kane Dead Men Tell (1941).

The cast of characters repeats to the point that I think Science Fiction Theater has a standard Reparatory and peppers the cast with some starts from the time.

The spooky thing is all of the technical (not the psychic) presentations have mostly come true. So, we are looking at speculation that has com and gone or been totally revised today. Such things as self-driving cars, Watson etc.

I had a previous set of this collection; I just wanted to replace mu existing collection with the highest quality from the original archival elements.

I also purchased the book as a supplement that tells much more than you read in this review

7010726,4,B00TJ30A04,"My sister and I sat down evenings and watched these shows three to four at a clip. It was on the air when I was pre-teen, but she's older. The shows are a real slice of the mid-1950s. I swear that every 4th show has to have a Geiger Counter involved in some way, reflecting the fascination with Atomic Energy at that time. You'll see most of the biases (gender especially) of the era, but surprisingly there are many shows where women shine in the lab and in the field. I do suggest that when watching the first season you turn off the color so the picture appears as black and white. (It is possible on all displays but not always easy to find.) Some of the color is OK but unfortunately whoever did the transfer and the post-production were clueless or lax and the colors in a number of shows are horrible and distracting. While this shift happens in color print film, an area of expertise for me, there is not reason these couldn't be vastly improved. Also the last disc or two are B&W and some of those transfers are horrible. They are so dark you might have to turn off the lights in the room.

That aside, this show is an interesting bit of nostalgia. For my part, I derived more enjoyment from seeing classic actors like Deforest Kelly, Vincent Price and some others in their younger days. The stories themselves are almost uniformly predictable and serendipity rules. Part of this is because the running time for the actual story is further reduced from a far too short half hour by having the host demonstrate some scientific principle (often only peripherally related and occasionally wrong). Then once the story is over the host has to remind the audience that they just saw something that was made sup (A sad irony considering our current state of fake news).

The productions are concise and surprisingly well constructed, given the limitations of 1950's television. I've watched a few on YouTube, but it's very satisfying to hear that familiar theme music and see Truman Bradley, the epitome of credibility, lay down a little over-simplified, naive 1950's pop science, complete with little demonstrations that are stimulating, if not very scientific. In the late 50's most of America believed in ""them,"" the authorities, the government, the people in the know, and it seemed that a rational world based on ever-growing scientific understanding was just around the corner. Behind this gee-whiz optimism, of course, the cold war was raging, and I attended duck-and-cover exercises at school, and regular evacs into the nearest Manhattan fallout shelter. They stopped calling them bomb shelters for a while, since everybody knew shelters would be useless. But on Thursday nights, Truman Bradley would smile confidently and pronounce another visionary possibility for the future, and TV stars of the next decade would dramatize a provocative glimpse of possibilities.",1472169600,4,1230,5.312820512820513

  This TV series has long been ignored. Pick up any book on the top television programs and this one will not likely be in it. Ask anyone and you would get looks like you imagined it. This series had an unforgettable gimmick that makes it a standout in SiFi. There was nothing mystical nor anything requiring a supernatural explanation. No pure flights of fantasy like ""Star Wars"" The stories were based on scientific facts, as they were then known and understood, which were carefully explained prior to the drama. The episodes ended with ""This story was fiction. It did not happen."", but you left thinking it could have. Looking at them from a half century later, you realize that the predictions were not so far wrong. The emphasis here is on SCIENCE. It was fiction because it was just too soon.
  As for quality, I'm not a stickler for perfect when it comes to these releases. The quality is on par with what TV was then, which should be good enough for recordings that no one at a time when ""solid state"" meant ice could have thought someone 50 years later would watch on a small disc known as a ""dvd"".",1455494400,4,1339,4.535269709543568

Though I have vague memories of watching this back in the late '60s/early '70s (fully 10+ years after it's original broadcast - I saw it as syndicated 'filler' for our local stations on their saturday programming), watching the episodes now is quite a thrill. I'm still amazed that it was originally filmed and presented in color during it's first of two seasons. The story lines are (so far, I'm still in the middle of watching the shows) decent enough. And the introductory 'science experiments' and demonstrations by Truman Bradley are actually more interesting than I'd have thought. Also, seeing some classic stars is another nice surprise (Vincent Price, Kenneth Tobey, DeForest Kelley - to name a few).
A couple of minor nit-picks: one of the season 1 episodes (The Long Day) is in black-and-white - I'm not sure if it may not have been filmed in color, or whether no color print exists. Also, a couple of the episodes appear 'out of sequence' on the DVDs. Again, neither one of these 'problems' is critical (at least for me).
There are no commentary tracks or extras. Also, there are no subtitles. Still, such things would be of the 'nice to have' variety, rather than being essential to enjoying the shows.",1451779200,3,1245,4.7953488372093025

  The other night I picked a random episode, Target Hurricane, on disc 3, to watch. Half of the show had the lower twenty-five percent jiggling. Marshall Thompson does not look that great doing the butt twist.
  I should mention I had two copies of this set. I thought maybe an early pressing error, so I bought (dumb, huh?) a third one. Same issue. It is also on a few more eppies on that disc.
  Adding insult to injury is that those poor public domain copies of the same programs do not show that jiggle. I wrote to Timeless today and got an almost immediate reply that this was from the best masters that MGM had. I have no doubt. What I do doubt is that it is a problem with the masters as opposed to a flaw in the transfer process.
  Worse is that this issue could be in more than the eppies on disc 3.

And as might be expected the quality on the YouTube videos varied from mediocre to downright terrible. But I figured if it was the only way I could enjoy these old classic episodes from the 50s' then I'd just grin and bear it. Then when I discovered the entire series was to be released to DVD I jumped at the chance to get the complete series ... fully expecting the quality to be similar to what I'd viewed on YouTube. But to my surprise the quality was excellent. A few speckles here and there ... but for the most part just as good as Complete Series Collections of the original Outer Limits, Boris Karloff's Thriller, and The Twilight Zone.

What a concept.  That's what I call reality TV.  What is even more amazing is how accurate some of the scenarios turned out to be.  1955, 56 and 57.  Preceded Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits.

The episodes are very intelligently written, and it engages the viewer's brain, unlike so much garbage that is on TV these days. I like how the host comes on at the beginning to discuss some aspect of science.  Episodes are nicely done and don't have to resort to the sort of wild special effects or sensationalism, scandal, violence, etc. that today's show needs in order to hold an ever-decreasing attention span of today's viewer who can barely take their eyes away from their smart phone to do anything else.  I also find it interesting comparing what was considered the latest and greatest technology of the time, and also what they envisioned as future technology, to what we actually have today.

Picture quality is as good as you can expect from a show produced so long ago on a small budget. The audio is clear and understandable. Sure, it can't compare to modern picture quality but then it's the content that makes it an excellent show, not the side fluff.  I'm very happy that this series has finally been released on DVD.

That was the time when some much sci-fi was becoming just plain science.  In some ways, the stories remind me of some of the ones I read in Astonishing Tales comics.  In these half hour capsules, you will see many stars that went on to movies or tv fame.  I also enjoyed the ""science lesson"" provided by the host, Truman Bradley at the start of each episode as well as the conclusion.

I love the color episodes, which appear on my big-screen TV pretty naturally.  Many of the later episodes are in black and white (am just past halfway through the set), and I don't  know if that's because the original color versions were lost or if they switched to B & W to save money.

It's such a shame that high quality television shows like Science Fiction Theatre are rarely made these days. At the beginning of each episode is a mini science lesson, followed by a well written fictional story that could be possible concerning the science discussed at the beginning. I believe that any child interested in science, regardless of the time difference between 1955 and now, would be fascinated by the stories presented. It is also fascinating to see some of the thoughts of the time that turned out to be wrong and those that eventually became a reality. Not just a show for science ""nerds"". This program had a little something for everyone. Well worth the $31.95 for 8 full disks, each containing 10-14 episodes.

Remarkably, although I was just five or six years old when the series aired, and despite having seen them only once, I still remembered a couple of episodes in detail more than 50 years later (specifically ""Living Lights"" and ""When a Camera Fails"").

Of course, I have bootleg DVDs recorded from the Sci-Fi Channel, as do most reviewers here, I suspect. But buying this ""professional"" release was a no-brainer. It's a great-looking set. The eight single-sided DVDs sport colorful, if a bit garish, labels that mimic the liner art, and there's a complete episode list on the inside of the case insert. The DVDs snap securely onto four plastic ""pages"" in the case. No way will they get scratched.

That's the good news. The less-good news is that the picture and sound quality still leave something to be desired. They're much better than the bootlegs, based on the few episodes that I've assessed so far, but they're not perfect. Colors and contrast vary noticeably from episode to episode, and sometimes even from scene to scene within an episode, and no one would describe the picture as ""sharp."" The audio is not particularly clear, and a low-pitched rhythmic pulsation mars the sound track in some places.

But I'm not complaining. I love this set. Timeless Media made the DVDs from the best sources available, and the fact that this classic early-days-of-television show exists at all makes up for the fact that it doesn't meet sky-high expectations honed by today's digital media. If you grew up with the show, or if you want to glimpse what the world was like ""back in the day"" when scientific literacy was important and respected, check out ""Science Fiction Theatre.""

We'll never see the likes of it again.",1431648000,,2073,5.0145348837209305
7010846,5,B00TJ30A04,"Less than 24hrs ago the mail person delivered my copy of SFT, I have already watched the entire first disc.  Wow what a blast from past, as a child of apx 8, I remember hiding my eyes from seeing the picture, on the tv.  The sound and picture on the disc are great, and since back in mid 50's everyone had B&W TV's, it was quite a surprise to see color, (no I don't always read all the details about something I'am getting, yes it is a bad habit), so of course I turned off the color on the TV. That's the way my Science Fiction Theatre was watched back in the day.  So to Timeless Media, Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, for giving us this treasure back.... Now with One Step Beyond and Tales of Tomorrow, we have 3 of the 50's greats.  Anyone up for releasing legal versions of the Captain Midnight, or Captain Video, TV shows???????????????",1431561600,3,843,4.25
7010847,5,B00TJ30A04,"Don't listen to the person who said it would be garbage before it was even released.  I got mine yesterday, and I gotta tell you, it's GREAT!!!!!  I also have the older 'Vintage Television' release - you know, the one recorded from taped television episodes and transferred to DVD, and this new release is superior in every conceivable way.  Yes, it's not HD, and perhaps Timeless could have wrung out a little more clarity had they used more discs.  But the picture resolution is more that just 'OK', and is literally orders of magnitude better than the nearest alternative.

You won't be disappointed!",1431475200,19,603,4.815533980582524
7010848,5,B00TJ30A04,"Just received my Timeless Box Set and did an A/B comparison in my HT with my 12 disc bootleg. First off, I only did the first show ""Beyond"" and the run time was 22:20 for the bootleg and 26:01 for the timeless.

 In the bootleg, you can hear, just barely, a buffeting sound in the sound track, like a window down while driving a car. On the Timeless, it's much louder and annoying, as least to me.

 The picture quality, if I rated the bootleg on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best, it's a 3. Kind of like an Alpha Video movie, watchable but that's about it.

 The Timeless is a 7-8. If they had put a dash more effort into it, it would have been great looking.

 I can't wait to sit down in the den and watch the rest of the episodes on my Mit DLP 65 incher. It should look like it was filmed in a warehouse...it's a KEEPER!!!  :3dglasses:",1431475200,5,836,4.048780487804878
7010849,5,B00TJ30A04,"Based on the first disc, the material is not from 35mm negatives but would appear to be superior to 16mm. A little on the soft side, the appearance is not helped by a bit rate rarely exceeding about 25% of potential (look for 3 something here, not a healthy 7)  due to the compressed number of titles per disc. I believe everything was on four clamshells, about 8 discs. Having done with every thing nasty, it is a pleasure to see Ken Tobey and his red hair at the pole in hypnotic episodes like Y.O.R.D. or Hank Pattison in No Food For Through before he appeared in TARANTULA which was based on the same story. Watch any two average episodes and you will be rewarded with an outstanding one. Such was groundbreaking baby boomer Nirvana in the mid 50's. Throw away the bootlegs; you are now where you need to be!",1431388800,,812,4.377483443708609

7010851,5,B00TJ30A04,"UPS just delivered my collection of Science Fiction Theater that I ordered from Amazon and I must say I am  extremely pleased and happy with the product that Timeless Media has given us 1950's nostalgia buffs as well as the quick as promised delivery.  The episodes are much better than expected and seem better than when shown on the Sci-Fi Channel. The packaging is very attractive. There are eight discs. I played three before writing this review and can find no problems. This is a series whose proper release I have been anticipating for many years. I have bought ""garage produced"" copies and paid more money for far less quality.  Now if Timeless Media can only release Rescue 8 I will be the happiest man in the world! But I'm happy enough now with Science Fiction Theater and your host, Truman Bradley!!",1431388800,41,811,4.697183098591549

8701964,5,B00TJ30A04,I much prefer to experience a series from this era as close as I can to the way the original audience did. After watching an episode in color I decided to create a custom setting on my tv specifically for watching this box set.

8701965,5,B00TJ30A04,"All right, Im old!  These episodes are those that I watched as a kid and they got me interested in wonders of science.  Watching them now, though they are, obviously dated, is still very entertaining.  I'm glad I got the entire series.  I even enjoy the intros to each episode by Truman Bradly.  Many of these old shows had persons who introduced the episodes.  It was a nice touch that isn't used any longer.",1527638400,,409,4.45945945945946

It is amazing to watch these broadcasts from the program's 2 year run and to think how things have changed in the years since the broadcast was first aired. The DVD quality is quite good, both audio and video. I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but all that I have watched have been technically very satisfactory. The acting and the story lines are good. Watch for Truman Bradley reading Scientific American at the end of each show. Just one more touch to add some authenticity to the series.",1519603200,,537,4.489795918367347
8701970,5,B00TJ30A04,"I just started watching these DVDs, but I must say that I am delighted to have gotten them. (I still remember some episodes I saw during my childhood.)  Although there are some technical errors with the science that is presented, the whole point of this series was to tickle your imagination- which these episodes still do!  A nice surprise was to find that these early episodes were filmed in color!  [I believe that is NOT true for the 2nd season - oh, well].  George McFly [of ""Back to the Future""] would approve!!",1519603200,,517,4.586956521739131
