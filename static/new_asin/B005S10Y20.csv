8484509,5,B005S10Y20,"I first saw this film when it was released and was greatly impressed by it. Until recently, it was unavailable for purchase in any format, so I was happy to find this DVD release so I could have the opportunity to review it after all these years. Now that I have, I still enjoyed it despite certain dated aspects. The transfer to DVD is pretty good. The audio quality is true to its time, ie, not up to modern standards, but OK.",1465430400,,428,4.2317073170731705

8484511,4,B005S10Y20,"Good  example  of  late  sixties  trendiness.  It  is  a  pity  that  Mike  Sarne  was  saddled  with  MYRA  BREKINRIDGE,  which  sabotaged  his  career.  He  did  have  genuine  talent  as a  director.  Unfortunately  the  DVD  is  not  in  the  proper  Cinemascope  aspect  ratio.",1445817600,,282,4.951219512195122
8484512,2,B005S10Y20,"This film I purchased elsewhere was ""reformatted to fit my screen"", which means the sides of the original were chopped off. I have a copy DVD made from a video I recorded off television some 10 years ago showing the full screen image. Very disappointed with this new release.",1441238400,4,275,4.63265306122449

8484514,4,B005S10Y20,"I am heartbroken that this is only available in Region 2 format, which,
I assume, is incompatible with my own. At the FSM/Film Score Monthly
site there's presently a discussion about this movie and its music. I had
 been sent a copy of the soundtrack CD by composer Rod McKuen
himself, and it has nearly twice the number of tracks, as did the fine LP
release from so many years ago.  This has been on my DVD (and Blu-ray)
wish list FOREVER and is a film I love.  I'll never forget the touching scene
near the end between Genevieve Waite and Donald Sutherlandand and
McKuen's beautiful ""Peter's Theme"" breaks our heart.  I love this movie.",1379116800,6,638,4.521739130434782
8484515,4,B005S10Y20,"The British Film Institute finally makes available in a Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Reg. 2 of Michael Sarne's minor hit film from 1968 ""Joanna"" now advertised as ""the female Alfie"" which I never heard before at the time of the film's release.  ""Joanna"" was the color film about a 17 year old coming to swinging London and meeting colorful characters.  Joanna was played by Genevieve Waite and co-stars included Donald Sutherland and Calvin Lockhart.  Because of ""Joanna"" Sarne was hired to direct ""Myra Breckinridge"" for Fox and we all know what that did.  Part of BFI Flipside which is dedicated to rescuing ""Weird and Wonderful"" British films from obscurity and presenting them in high-quality editions.  Special features include High Definition and Standard Definition.  Michael Sarne's debut short film ""Road to Saint Tropez"" (1966) (which features Udo Kier) and ""Death May Be Your Santa Claus,"" another short by Frankie Dymon Jnr. from 1968 an experimental examination of an interracial relationship in late 1960s London (similar themes found in ""Joanna"").  An interview with Sarne, Michael Sarne's novel ""Joanna"" presented as a downloadable PDF and an illustrated booklet with essays by Chris Campion and Kodwo Eshun.  Rod McKuen composed the score for ""Joanna"" making one of the best scores ever.  There are a feast of songs from the movie on the soundtrack.  Waite and Lockhart had small roles in ""Myra Breckinridge.""  Now we can see what made them rate in an odd reversal of acknowledgement.",1376524800,2,1493,5.153526970954357
8484516,4,B005S10Y20,"BUYERS SHOULD NOTE that this is a REGION 2 set that won`t play on most U.S. players.  I have a region free player that played the regular movie version on disc 1, but not the Blue-Ray version on disc two.  One must also  have a region free Blue-Ray player to do so.  The movie was not as good as I remembered seeing it in the theatre, still it is worth viewing and hearing the Rod McKuen songs.",1375056000,,394,4.077922077922078
