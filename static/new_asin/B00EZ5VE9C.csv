5958154,5,B00EZ5VE9C,"I got hooked on Karl when watching him travel from country to country on 'Idiot Abroad.' Now, I have watched the first few episodes of ""The Moaning of Life"" on this BluRay and love it. Super funny. The only downside is that it is a format that some USA DVD players will not play. My Sony would not play it, but my LG DVD player will play it.",1402963200,2,341,4.029411764705882
5958155,4,B00EZ5VE9C,"If you liked ""Idiot Abroad""- then you'll like this!  Very, very funny. No problems playing on my USA Samsung Blu-ray player.",1399680000,5,124,4.904761904761905

5958160,4,B00EZ5VE9C,"The series is quite incredible and I'm saddened that there aren't more (of this and An Idiot Abroad). The Moaning of Life is a lot like An Idiot Abroad, but provides a more intimate look into Karl's mind - which is hilarious. The only complaint I have is that there aren't more of them!

Heads up: the discs will not play in my PS3, but play just fine in my Xbox One.",1417478400,4,367,4.097222222222222
5958161,5,B00EZ5VE9C,"If you are a fan of Karl, this is a fun series.  However, it would not play in my Sony Blue Ray.  I have an LG and a Samsung Blue Ray Player, and no problems with either of those.  So, if you only have a Sony, you may want to hesitate before purchasing this.",1414108800,5,258,3.740740740740741
5958162,5,B00EZ5VE9C,I'm a little biased because I love Karl's philosophy rants. It's funny and  I enjoyed the different ways it looked at the different stages of life.,1411603200,2,147,4.653846153846154

5958165,5,B00EZ5VE9C,We cannot get enought of Karl Pilkington the guy has such a unique point of view on life.  The disc played fine on our PS4.,1403049600,4,123,3.92
8610639,4,B00EZ5VE9C,"Its hard to live up to ""An Idiot Abroad "", but Carl is always worth watching.",1524096000,,77,3.875
8610640,5,B00EZ5VE9C,"If you liked An Idiot Abroad you'll love this series. Karl is much funnier when he's not being a stooge to Ricky Gervais and just being himself. As he travels the world looking for what makes people happy, or want children, or how they pick a career, his look at the world is both insightful and his comments hysterical.",1482796800,,320,4.440677966101695
8610641,5,B00EZ5VE9C,The show is hilarious. Love Karl. But this dvd is for UK only. Didn't realize. No one be as stupid as me. Thankfully I can play it on my Mac. But great show.,1453420800,,157,3.787878787878788

8610648,4,B00EZ5VE9C,Very good but rather short with just 5 episodes. I think Idiot Abroad was helped by Ricky and Steve needling him.,1433721600,,113,4.428571428571429
