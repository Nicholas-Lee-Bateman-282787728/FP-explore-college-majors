8308006,1,B001H57Y56,"Universal... if you wait long enough before releasing these... you won't have any customers left to remember the show. The longer you wait, the more of us who die. You are not gaining customers by waiting. You are losing them. It is simple arithmetic for those of you who can still count.

You should release these now while we are still around and alive to buy these DVD's... and you can forget about those of us in the age group who remember these shows, buying blue ray or some other ""fad of the month"" format. We want plain DVD format. If you don't believe it... just look in the aisles of any store selling both formats and see which ones the customers are buying. The blueray aisles are always empty of shoppers and the products are not moving. No one is going to change over to a format which costs 3 times as much as regular DVD. That's the same with HD... who wants to buy new units and pay higher prices just to see the blemishes on someone's face?

This is the problem with all of you who DRAG OUT these DVD releases. You think the interest is waning on these items... when the problem is your SLOWNESS in releasing the products. Every year, more of us die. The more of us who die... the less who are alive to buy the product. It is time for you guys to figure this out. You will eventually end up with a collection in your vault which no one remembers and will earn zero revenue at that point when we are all gone.

Just look at the TV series Dallas. They are finally releasing the last season of Dallas in Jan 2011. But how many people died between the release of season one and season 14? Did anyone gain by this delay? Tens of thousands of viewers died over these years waiting for the seasons to be released. Those customers will never be replaced. None of these series will be born again with a new audience... so get with it and get these shows released while we are still around and still able to buy them. There are still 2 sequel movies which don't even have a release date yet.

You also have to keep in mind that retired people can't afford as much as they could have when they were on an active payroll... so that is another thing to consider. The sooner you release, the more sales you will get. You should do it as quickly as possible. Also keep in mind that a lot of people don't know when you have made a product available. There is no place on Amazon to even place an order for this product if it became available... so it might be 2 or 3 years until the fans of the show find out it is available... but when they do, they will buy it if they are still alive.

So, use some common sense. I realize it is in short supply with Xgens running the corporations and the anarchistic attitude you have toward the things our generation cared about... but you should be able to understand that the sooner you release a product, the more people who remember the show... who are still fans... who will still be alive to buy it. You gain nothing by waiting except the deaths of those customers who died waiting for you to get off of your ....",1289088000,12,3058,4.247422680412371
8308007,5,B001H57Y56,"For a true Hitchcock fan theses are a must, they are a bit pricey and are made by universal for Italy. (Don't know why there not released here yet)
But the second audio track is English, most newer (cheap) DVD player will play PAL format and can be made region free really easy, search the internet",1281052800,,298,4.339285714285714
8308008,4,B001H57Y56,"My reservations about this set - which keeps me from giving 5 stars - are the random order of the episodes as well as no neat extras.

Picture and sound are excellent, being from the Universal vault. Just be sure to use the audio set up options and choose English.

NOW, as to others whining about this set not being available for US players, do yourselves a favor and get a region-free player (several sold by Amazon). They are not expensive, play all DVDs, and will open a whole new world of DVD watching by letting you get DVDs from all over the world. The British Amazon (amazon.co.uk) is an excellent source.",1275609600,6,613,4.464285714285714
8308009,1,B001H57Y56,"I, too, strongly feel that Universal is really doing a disservice to those of us in the U.S. by not making the Alfred Hitchcock Hour available here.  There are a lot of Hitchcock fans wanting to buy this series but because it's not legally available here, others are making huge profits by selling bootleg dvds of the shows copied from both TV and elsewhere.

I also think the very slow releasing of AH Presents (the 1/2 hour series) is taking way too long between seasons.  Universal is definately NOT remastering them so why the wait ?!?

For all the money Hitchcock made for Universal, you'd think the company would share the master's other works with his fans.

8308010,1,B001H57Y56,What's wrong with this country when so many TV shows that are produced in the USA are being released on DVD overseas BUT NOT HERE?? Un-sickeningly-believable.,1244592000,9,158,5.115384615384615
