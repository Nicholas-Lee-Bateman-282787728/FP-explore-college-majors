2117349,5,B0002S65WM,"Ballard's 1993 expedition to observe the Lusitania, whose location was known, to confirm or deny suspicions about her sinking in 1915.  The 6 min. making of short is enlightening, in that over 5 times the footage  of the final program was actually shot over three years of production.

The 28 min. bonus program on the Andrea Doria sinking in 1956, which doesn't involve Ballard, is less satisfying.  It concentrates on the survivors and their rescue.  Yet the question postulated at the beginning of the program about why the ship, better built than the Titanic, still sank after the collision with the Stockholm is never technically answered.  Also, points brought out in the inquest as to why the accident happened aren't brought forward save one for discussion, which are covered in the book Saved! by William Hoffer, who is interviewed for the program.  An explanation of further changes to make the seas safer to travel after this tragedy would also have been appropriate.",1372118400,3,978,5.0
2117350,4,B0002S65WM,"The dawn of the 20th century, the war to end all wars was just a few months old.  Enter the Lusitania a luxury british liner. It left New York in May 1915, destination Liverpool, England. She never made it because the Germans sank her just off the coast of Ireland at 1:30 PM May 7th 1915.  The film shows where she lies on the bottom and how her sinking caused America to enter WWI two years later.  A good film to have in your collection.  This is true history and a must have for that reason alone.  Like the Titanic, most people will be knowledgeable about Lusitania if you were alive at that time in history.",1334966400,4,613,4.25
2117351,4,B0002S65WM,"National Geographic's hour-long LAST VOYAGE OF THE LUSITANIA blends a handful of antique film clips with reminiscences of a few survivors and narration from Martin Sheen. The lion's share of this documentary is devoted to Robert Ballard's underwater explorations via his mini-sub Jason of the RMS Lusitania's resting place.

Because the ship lay damaged-side-down, Ballard, who was first to locate the Titanic and Bismarck wrecks, finds it impossible to say with certainty that a lone torpedo caused an explosion of rumored contraband armaments. A long track of coal on the ocean floor leading to the remains may indicate that when the motored bomb hit, it caused nearby coal dust in almost-empty bins to fill the air. This cloud might easily have ignited with the torpedo's flash, thus tearing the boat's right side aft of its cargo hold to shreds, explaining why Lusitania sank in a mere 18 minutes.

Most tragic of all is the final segment. Cunard's 1915 files on the disaster are examined and we see photo after grueling photo of some of the nearly 300 recovered bodies. Many are children and infants; all have the dreadful appearance of victims drowned in an unforgiving sea.

For the record, 1,198 of the 1,959 on board Lusitania died on May 7th, 1915 after the unlucky liner crossed paths with the German U-20 submarine. This predator had already sunk three ships: the Candidate, The Centurion and Miss Morris, a merchant schooner. One torpedo launched from a half-mile distance was all it took to quickly send Lusitania to a watery grave.",1262908800,4,1546,4.984496124031008
2117352,4,B0002S65WM,"After all those years it is revealing to learn of the demise of the Lusitania and what lead up to the demise of The Lusitania, I felt sorry for all those lives lost and what the survivors had to endure.",1254182400,,202,4.075
2117353,4,B0002S65WM,"As an ocean liner lover, this one was a home run. Robert Ballard certainly knows how to tell the tell of a doomed ocean liner, with interviews of actual passengers and historical film footage. Definitely worth viewing!!",1229040000,,219,4.945945945945946
2117354,4,B0002S65WM,"This documentary is just a wee bit thin with respect to the Lusitania.  It leaves open the precise reason the vessel sank, and all we have is speculation about the explosion of coal dust.  The views of the liner on the ocean floor are not nearly as extensive as those of Titanic, so we cannot see the effects of the second explosion, the one that followed that of the U-boat torpedo.  Was no attempt made to enter the wreck?  If not, why not?  We saw inside Titanic, which was broken in two or three sections.

It would also have been useful to have more on the political fallout over the sinking.  A propaganda medal was struck (I have one), a bronze disk showing death selling tickets to the passengers.  It was supposedly of German make but was cast in Britain and distributed in the U.S. to get America into the Great War.  According to this documentary, the sinking angered Americans enough to go to war--but it took 23 months to do this, with a presidential election between.  Why?  President Wilson was reelected with the slogan, ""He kept us out of war.""  The film left all that out.

The best part of this disk is about the Andrea Dproa/Stockholm disaster.  I was on the Cunard Line pier in 1956 when the Stockholm docked with survivors of the disaster and saw frightened passengers of the Doria actually kiss the solid concrete.  It was a special moment.

The comprehensive Lusitania documentary is yet to be made.  Meanwhile, we have this.",1225065600,18,1449,4.575875486381323

2117357,5,B0002S65WM,"I thought this was an excellent review of what might have happened to Lusitania.  The question of the second explosion was really not resolved, but I doubt at this juncture that it much matters.  She is at the bottom of the ocean, and took over 1,000 souls down with her.  I thought the captain of the ship was somewhat casual about the warning with regard to the submarine activity in that area, and is partly to blame for this disaster.  But, too late now as it's been over 100 years since it all happened.  Being German myself, I feel somewhat ashamed of what the German Submariners did, and the non-caring attitude toward the passenger ships that they sunk.  But, I wasn't there to pull the trigger.",1462579200,3,703,4.5396825396825395
2117358,5,B0002S65WM,"This video of the tragic event was particularly poignant due to vignettes of several survivors and witnesses.

2117368,4,B0002S65WM,"The Lusitania disaster inspires more controversy and debate on the circumstances of her demise than even the Titanic.  In 1993 Dr. Robert Ballard set out to explore (she wasn't lost like the Titanic) the wreck of the Lusitania off the coast of Ireland.  This documentary starts with the hope of finding the exact cause of the mysterious second explosion that tore through the Lusitania after the u-boat torpedo got her on that May day in 1915.  By the end of this hour long event, what ""evidence"" was uncovered is a little flimsy and inconclusive, but this is still a fine doc on a sad event.
It may have been inevitable that once he discovered the Titanic in 1985, Dr. Ballard would become the go-to man for exploring other legendary wrecks.  Anyone who's seen him interviewed or contribute to a documentary knows he's a great showman (and brilliant oceanographer) who can spin complicated scientific facts into easily understood phrases.  His good-humor and care for what he is doing always shine through, even here.  Throughout the doc a handful of Lusitania survivors and eyewitnesses alive at the time of filming recount what they can remember of the sinking, while Martin Sheen provides some good narration, with one or two songs by Enya popping up in the score (I don't understand why Enya music is appropriate here but I'm a fan so why question!)
Although the ending may feel a little anti-climactic (we are no closer to discovering the second explosion due to a combination of poor wreck conditions and equipment malfunctioning), this is still a tastefully undertaken, classic National Geographic documentary about a war-time tragedy that will be recounted and debated long after the wreck disintegrates.",1424217600,2,1713,5.014084507042254

2117373,5,B0002S65WM,"Although many people are more interested in the sinking of the ""Titanic,"" I have always been more interested in the sinking of the ""Lusitania"" and what possibly caused this great ship to sink so rapidly with such a huge loss of life. The video theorizes, through careful examination, what Dr. Ballard believes is the real cause for the sinking of this mammouth ship in 1915. It does an outstanding job bringing the human interest element into the production by interviewing key eye-witnesses who were passengers (sadly, these people have all since died, making this historical video even more valuable). Highly recommend for research and/or for educational purposes by students and teachers alike.",1392076800,4,697,5.232142857142857

8031294,2,B0002S65WM,"There's no mystery about what sunk the Lusitania: contraband munitions. Artillery shells, fuses, gun cotton. She was sunk with ONE TORPEDO. Her sister ship survived being hit with 12 TORPEDOES, and STILL MANAGED TO SAIL TO PORT.  The Captain was made the scapegoat. F.D.R. wanted to get us into WWI. Her sinking was an atrocity committed against The American People. While the German U-boat crew was responsible for attacking her (she was UNESCORTED AND SAILING WITH ONE ENGINE SHUT DOWN), they were not responsible for her sinking. She, her crew, and all others who died, were the victims of politicians.",1483401600,,605,5.05
