8188095,5,B000P0ROA4,"This is a collection of racialist pride songs in music videos and live performances from the twins Lynx and Lamb, who have a great natural charisma.  The talent really shines through, especially when the ladies are singing in unison.  The musical product is rather remarkable, if you realize that there is no bass guitar, no lead guitar, and no drum or percussion of any kind!  Listeners with musical training have only to imagine what these same tracks would sound like with a full arrangement, some harmony, some lead guitar, and some counter melodies added!

The song ""Lamb Near the Lane,"" co-written with David Lane, has a haunting, moving quality that would probably be at the chill bump raising level, if it were fully studio produced and arranged.

It includes bonus concert footage from the Ian Stuart Memorial concert and others, as well as film from the 2005 European American Conference, with a short introduction by Dr. David Duke.  The extra section is very interesting.  The video quality is excellent.  The audio is high quality in the music videos and better than expected in the concert performances, which are of course live audio.  One of the ladies plays violin in the stage performances.

From the back cover:

""They're smart.  They're sweet.  They're pretty.  They're multi-talented instrumentalists and singers.  They're twins.  They're loving sisters to the new baby in the family.  They beat neocon radio talk show hosts at their own game.  They're just thirteen years old.  They make beautiful, soaring, harmonious music together -- music with a pro-white slant.  They're the daughters of National Vanguard writer and activist April Gaede.  And they are the most talked-about duo in the burgeoning euromusic scene:  They are Prussian Blue.""

Highly recommended.",1412035200,,1787,5.149825783972125
