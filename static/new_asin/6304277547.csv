821071,4,6304277547,"When a wrestling fan hears the words ""Survivor Series 1997"", one name springs to mind: Bret Hart.
If you are any wrestling fan worth your salt, you need to own this videotape.  The undercard features the  traditional Survivor Series format matches, which, although quite  predictable, helped to keep the pro-Canadian crowd happy.  Kane solidified  his position of the most imposing force since the in-ring debut of his  ""brother"" The Undertaker, at the same event seven years previous.  Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin provided a short, yet highly  emotional match, when both could have called a sicky (Owen had a brain  bruise, thanks to Ahmed Johnson, and Austin was getting over having his  neck broken three months before at SummerSlam, another ace PPV).
But this  event will be remembered for the treatment of one Bret ""Hit Man""  Hart, the canadian hero, screwed in his own country by a paranoid Vince  McMahon.  You won't pick this information up for the propagandic commentary  of Jim Ross, but if you watch ""Hitman Hart: Wrestling With  Shadows"", you'll have a better idea on Bret's thoughts before, during  and after this match, the most controvercial match in wrestling ever, and  one that will be talked about for years to come.",949536000,10,1245,4.961165048543689

821245,5,6304277547,"Overall this was an excellent event for the exception of the extreamly upsetting ending to the main event. Here are the matches.

1. Road Dogg, Billy Gunn, Phinneas Godwinn, and Henry Godwinn VS. Headbanger Mosh, Headbanger Thrasher, Bradshaw, and Barry Windham 7/10

Good opening match, but it went a lttle too slow.

2. Kurrgan, Recon, Sniper, and The Jackel VS. Crush, 8-Ball, Skull, and Chainz 6/10

This was not as good as I thought it was going to be becausewas too short and the same person kept on doing the eliminations.

3. Vader, Marc Mero, Steve Blackman, and Goldust VS. British Bulldog, Jim The Anvil Neidhart, Doug Furnas, and Phil LaFon 10/10

This was one the best matches of the night. I truly think this was a good classic Survivor Series match. All wrestlers did their best except for Goldust who never wrestled and just stood there. Just a good match!

4. Mankind VS. Kane 8/10

This match was not as good as I expected. Although Mankind made many valiant efforts such as when he tripped over the stairs and the railing, chokeslammed or pushed through a table, and slammed to the hard floor.

5. Faarooq, The Rock, D-Lo Brown, and Kama VS. Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, Animal, and Hawk 8/10

Good match but I would have been happier if Shamrock's entire team survived.

6. Stone Cold Steve Austin VS. Owen Hart 7/10

A REALLY short match. There is nothing much to describe here other than Owen Hart's t-shirt was funny, and that Steve Austin stunned Owen to win the Intercontinental Title.

7. Shawn Michaels VS. Bret The Hitman Hart 10/10 or 0/10

I really do not know what to rate this because it was a good fight but Bret Hart was also stolen from the title. It took a while for this match to start because when they both got to the ring, they fought outside and then they went to the ring. All was going well until Shawn Michaels put Bret Hart in a sharpshooter and Vince McMahon made the referee and the bell man to ring the bell when Bret did not tap. After that Shawn Michaels left with the title really fast and then Bret Hart just went really CRAZY and broke everthing at ringside.",1108166400,,2111,4.535620052770448

7866223,5,6304277547,"With today marking the 17th anniversary of the Montreal Screwjob, I thought I'd take a little bit of time to go ahead and review the 1997 Survivor Series

1.) Survivor Series Elimination Match: The New Age Outlaws and The Godwinns vs The Headbangers and The New Blackjacks

The show opens with a rather lackluster Tag Team bout to start things off. The action wasn't all that great or exciting but the heel team---mainly Billy Gunn and Road Dogg did manage to get a little bit of heat from the crowd. Henry Godwinn, Barry Windham, Mosh, and Phineas are the first 4 to go. The final 2 teams left are the Outlaws and the pairing of Thrasher and Bradshaw. After Bradshaw is eliminated, Thrasher is left to fend for himself but is unable to take on both Outlaws. Billy Gunn pins Thrasher for the win after an impressive Fameasser off the top turnbuckle. Not a great opening match to start things off

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Survivor Series Elimination Match: The DOA vs The Truth Commission

Another bad match to follow the first. To make it short, the 2 final competitors in the match are Crush and The Interrogator. The Truth Commission win after The Interrogator hits a sidewalk slam on Crush

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

A video is displayed of the Canadian fans giving their thoughts and predictions on the main event match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. Some of the fans spoke English but most spoke French since a large part of Montreal consists of French-Canadians

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Survivor Series Elimination Match:Team USA (Vader, Goldust, Marc Mero w/Sable, and Steve Blackman) vs Team Canada (The British Bulldog, Jim Neidhart, Doug Furnas, and Phil Lafon)

At this point, the USA vs Canada feud had been going on in the WWF since July of that year and this match would mark the final match between USA and Canada to determine which country was superior---or at least which country had the superior wrestlers representing them. After the last 2 horribly paced matches, we finally got some pretty good action here in this back and forth match-up. The final 2 comes down to Bulldog and Vader who display a decent showing of battle of the big men. Bulldog ends up cheating, hitting Vader with the ring bell to score the pinfall on Vader and put an end to the 4 month long Canada vs USA rivalry. Fairly good match here but the USA vs Canada match that main evented In Your House: Canadian Stampede was way better

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

There's a segment with Lawler and J.R on the phone with a female fan who won a sweepstakes contest to have dinner with a superstar of her choice for the evening and chose Stone Cold Steve Austin. Lawler gets mad that she chose Austin over her. I seem to notice that WWF did a lot of these segments back in mid 90s through the end of 1997 where there'd be some random contest or giveaway. And they ALWAYS took place on PPV.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Mankind vs Kane w/Paul Bearer

This was Kane's debut PPV match and it was a fairly stiff one at that. Mankind attacks Kane as he makes his way to the ring and for some reason, Kane's red mood lighting stayed on for the duration of this match. Of course with Kane only having debuted a month before, he no-sold a lot Mankind's attacks to maintain his monstrous image. The biggest part of the match is where Kane throws Mankind off the apron and through the announcer's table. In the end, Kane drops Mankind with a Tombstone to secure the win

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Michael Cole interviews Vince McMahon backstage, asking him who he thinks will be the winner of the Bret/Shawn match and McMahon simply smiles and says he doesn't know. Of course this was sort of mixing on-screen storylines with off-screen issues as McMahon clearly knew who'd win---but when doesn't he know the outcome of matches. But more on that in a few minutes

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Survivor Series Elimination Match: The Nation of Domination vs Legion of Doom, Ahmed Johnson, and Ken Shamrock

This match is what I'd call comme ci, comme a. So-so, not that good and not that bad. Decent paced and goes on for a little while in itself. The New Age Outlaws get involved mid-way through the match who came to the ring wearing LOD's shoulder spikes. and cause Animal to get counted out after having powder thrown in his eyes. Shamrock comes down to the final one from his team in a 2 on 1 situation against The Rock and D'Lo Brown. Shamrock makes quick work of D'Lo and ends up making The Rock tap to the Ankle Lock to win the match. Decent match here but could've moved a bit faster at times for a 20 minute Tag Team match

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Owen Hart (c) w/Team Canada vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

Team USA vs Team Canada wasn't the only feud that came to an end here, as this was also the final encounter between Stone Cold and Owen Hart and a rather short match at that. Owen came to the ring with Team Canada to have his back while the Montreal crowd aggressively chanted ""break his neck"" to Owen. Within minutes, Team Canada are banned from ringside. Despite Owen's tactics, Stone Cold gets retribution on Owen with a Stunner to win the match.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWF Championship Match: Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart (c)

And the match that everyone had been waiting for and the match where everyone knows what goes down at the end. McMahon, who was a usual commentator back then hadn't been at the announce table for this PPV, more than likely because of the backstage situations involving Bret going into the PPV, but more on that shortly. The build-up for this match was amazing. Probably the best build-up they had between each other throughout their entire feud. Shawn Michaels played up his hate for Canada by snatching a flag from a fan at ringside and proceeded to blow his nose on it and hump it in the middle of the ring. The match itself tends to get overshadowed by all the surrounding controversy that took place at the end. The match itself was pretty good and was pretty intense. There were quite a few ""fourth wall""-like moments that took place in this match though such as Vince McMahon appearing with Sgt. Slaughter at the entrance way to try and get the brawl between Shawn and Bret back in the ring. Then there was J.R. stating on commentary that there was speculation that Bret would leave WWF if he lost. After such an amazing, psychological like fight, the end was near. Shawn slaps the Sharpshooter on Bret and within moments of turning him over, Earl Hebner rings the bell and just like that Bret Hart was screwed and his 13 year relationship with the business went up in smoke. What follows is a legitimate, unbridled chaos as the crowd is livid at what they just witnessed and bathe the ring in trash and empty beer cups. With word of Bret refusing to put Shawn over, McMahon put together a master plan to screw Bret over in his own country. Shawn pretends to be mad about what happened and storms off to the back, while McMahon, the mastermind of the screwjob emerged from the shadows and had an icy cold staredown with Bret for a few seconds before Bret cemented the end of his relationship with McMahon by spitting in his face. Bret destroys the announce table and in probably the most memorable image from this moment, air writes WCW with his finger as the show comes to a hellacious close

Overall: Of course, it's not that hard to see that the Montreal Screwjob set off a chain of events that effected the WWF and most notably the 3 way relationship between Vince, Bret, and Shawn for the next 12 years following this PPV. This is not the appropriate place to rant off about the Montreal Screwjob and give my opinions on it but I will say that as a result, it altered the way people looked at the business forever and made the 1997 Survivor Series the most controversial Survivor Series ever. In fact, I'd even be willing to say that this PPV (particularly this one) is overshadowed by the Screwjob. Despite the first 2 opening matches, Survivor Series 1997 was a pretty great PPV. A lot of the matches on the card were well put together and transitioned well in the ring. Even the main event match. Had the ending not tarnished the match overall, it could've been a classic match for the ages. Overall, despite the controversy it'll forever be associated with, Survivor Series 1997 is a great and historical PPV",1415491200,,9100,5.12694125590817

It's funny to see HBK spit on the crowd, then they all spit on him back. Shawn doesn't go all out on this match, he doesn't ""Skin the cat"", or do the elbow drop off the top rope.

November 9, 1997

Molson Centre

Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Headbangers & New Blackjacks V. New Age Outlaws & Godwinns

not a very good opener. The match was slow and very underwhelming with the Outlaws surviving. *3/4

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

D.O.A. V. Truth Commission

Another match that wasn't good. It was more watchable than the first match. Kurrgan is the sole survivor. **

Classic Survivor Series Match:

Vader, Goldust, Marc Mero, & Steve Blackman

V.

British Bulldog, JIm ""The Anvil"" Neidhart, Doug Furnas, & Phil Lafon

Finally, a good match. The crowd was into the way and the action was awesome. The Bulldog is the sole survivor. ***1/4

Mankind V. Kane

Mick takes his hardcore bumps to show that Kane is a monster. Kane wins. ***

Classic Survivor Series Elimination Match:

Faarooq, The Rock, Kama, & D'lo-Brown

V.

Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, & Legion Of Doom

This match was horrible until the finish. Great work by Rocky & Shamrock and it helped the rating alot but the overall match was still pretty crappy. Shamrock is the sole survivor in this one. **1/4

WWF Interocntinental Championship:

Owen Hart (Champion) V. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin

This match sucked. It was like six minutes long and Austin only got the Lou Thesz (Rest In Peace) Press and a few punches and kicks in before hitting the Stunner to win the title. *1/2 However, Austin still have a very hurt neck at this point so I guess it's cool. I really don't think they wanted Austin to get hurt.

WWF Championship:

Bret Hart (Champion) V. Shawn Michaels

Ok. Everyone knows what happened at the end of this match. Yes, Bret did indeed get screwed. However, people, I'm here to rate the matches and to give an honest opinion on the Pay-Per-View as a whole. and as for as I can see, this match was the Main Event. So I'm going to rate it just like I have rated everyone of my reviews (Which some of them I have to redo because I did them but memory and I wasn't writing anything down). So lets get started.

The match started out as a brawl all over the Molson Centre. Then they finally get into the ring where some great wrestling and back and forth action takes place. Then the ref gets bumped and you all know the rest. Shawn puts Bret into the Sharpshooter and the ref calls for the bell. Shawn wins the WWF Championship. Bret flips outs and was never seen in the WWF again. The match itself was actually awesome except for the ending. So my rating of the match...**** Yes, it was a four star match. Maybe five if the real finish was put into place.

Overall, not that good of a show but very well known for the Championship match and finish and Bret's last match in the WWF. On A Personal Note: I can't wait for the Bret Hart DVD to come out and everyone (Bret Hart Fan or Not) should pick it up. It's going to be awesome!",1129507200,2,2902,4.5482625482625485
