8353974,5,B002750TGG,"Slumdog Millionaire Two Disc Collector's Edition DVD pack has done good service in my classroom.  The perfect movie for human struggle and awareness of global issues such as exploitation and poverty.  Purchased easily and on-time.  Interesting that this is an Indian DVD set, so subtitles are written very politely when sountrack uses the f-word and other naughty English curse words.",1357948800,,384,5.366666666666666
