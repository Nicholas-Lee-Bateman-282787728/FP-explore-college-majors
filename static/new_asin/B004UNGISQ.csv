8441860,5,B004UNGISQ,"The depth of feeling and connection portrayed by Stormy in this honest and reveling account of horse and human is beyond what words can describe.  As we are taken into the world of the horse everything I thought I knew about horse and human connection was brought into question.  Stormys gentle approach demonstrates with kindness how so much of accepted training and care practices are in reality culturally acceptable applications of abuse.  The Path to the Horse is an eye opening experience that everyone who loves, works with, or just wants to spend time with horses should read.  For the good of the horse and the betterment of the connection between horse and human, I highly recommend that everyone who spends any time at all with horses read the book and watch the CD.",1467849600,,777,4.776119402985074

8441862,5,B004UNGISQ,"I have spoken ""Horse"" since I first spoke. This DVD took me back to my most meaningful times with my horse.  I rode in error, having learned to ride ""English"" and then ""Western"".  As a teen, I worked the summer at 15 earning enough to ourchase my very own horse at 16 after having found an empty but grand horse barn and arranging to care for my horse daily after school and buy my own feed and bedding as well as ride him to the nearest Vet for his care.  The best times were spending time with my horse on the ground: grooming, stroking and scratching his head and body; and walking in the corral with him and our chasing and runing with each other.  After experiencing this DVD. I understand why I loved our being together so much and I am so sad by what I did to him with the bit and saddle.  This film does not just speak of being with horses, but about being with ourself in ouf life minute to minute while we are alive.",1385164800,5,926,4.122222222222222
8441863,5,B004UNGISQ,"I found this video extremely enlightening. I have always enjoyed being around horses since I was a child. Although I have never be able to afford to own one myself I always had friends who had horses. The thing that I have always enjoyed most about being around horses was just that: ""being with the horse"". I loved the smells of the barn and the horses. I especially loved hanging with the horses when they were out to pasture. I never became an ""accomplished"" rider and I was OK with that. This DVD helps me to understand more clearly why I felt the way I did. It shows you the way that most people relate to horses and that is with an attitude of having to have ""power over"" the animals. But to really have a realtionship you do not have to do this. By seeing the world through the ""eyes of the horse"" and learning to relate on their level you end up having more freedom within yourself and at the same time it allows for more freedom in the horse. This DVD shows the next step in relating with horses that requires patience, flexibility and creativity on the part of the horse owner. We can be better horse people! and this DVD shows us a way to do that if you dare open your eyes and heart to see and listen to the message the horses are trying to share with us!
Learn from the likes of: Klaus Ferdinand Hempfling, Alexander Nevzorov, Carolyn Resnick, Linda Kohanov, Mark Rashid and Kim McElroy just to name a few...all the people interviewed were horse professionals. Remember that it only takes a step to start down the path and sometimes the smallest step is the most profound!",1344038400,19,1585,4.376271186440678
