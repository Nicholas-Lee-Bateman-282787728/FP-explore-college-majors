8440872,4,B004TTOQBC,I was a kid living near the docks in South Philadelphia in the mid 1960's. I had a port number at 16 and was a longshoreman/stevedore on and off till I was 23.  Some of those things in the movie were realistic some were not.  I remember the police to be a lot more violent and impatient with the least little resistance or back talk setting them off. Maybe New York was different than Philadelphia. Seemed strange his parents were so old and that he was an only child. Perhaps they were immigrants and his parents had their normal life cycle interrupted  in WW II Europe. The acting was good enough. It was fun to see James Darren portray an American of Polish ancestry. The prodigal son story/script was typical for that time period and the good won out over the evil. In today's plots  more of the good people would have died and the end would be grayer. All in all it would have been better colorized. I suppose I would have to call it good historical fiction now. Robert Blake was the most recognizable actor of the supporting cast though many of the other bit parts cast were filled by familiar character actors of the 50's and 60's.  I was entertained and able to see so much more at this stage than merely a simple 50's teenager parody.,1504137600,,1243,4.386956521739131

8440874,3,B004TTOQBC,"To people who weren't around until the 70's or later, it's hard for them to understand that streetgangs were a big problem in New York & other cities.  N.Y. had a few hundred different gangs with members from 5 in some, up to over 1,000 in others. All rumbling or fighting with other rival clubs, over control of an area or turf &it's benefits or for revenge for various reasons. This movie takes that and blends it with the then also common Longshoremen union corruption, where a  corrupt union boss uses the gang as thugs for criminal backup. However the leader of one gang has other problems, like his own disapproving father, the rival gangleader who tried to rape the first leaders girlfriend, etc. It's like  'On The Waterfront' meets 'The Blackboard Jungle', theres spots & the ending that falls a little flat but overall it's good.",1424044800,,839,4.6938775510204085
8440875,3,B004TTOQBC,"But not as good as either of those films.  Its not that Rumble on the Docks doesnt have its moments, but as a whole this film is uneven and rather silly.  The rumble parts come off as pure camp, and the final scene in the parking garage is half great and then a complete wash when Edgar Barrier comes in to save the day (seriously people, what?) but the film does work when it strikes the Waterfront angle, dealing with a shady longshoreman and his goons and their particular interest in a young gang member.  The film boasts itself as a film about gang war, and yet it really loses interest in that angle relatively quickly to become something else entirely.  This film just fails to blend all of its plot points (gangs, corrupt business, love interest) and the ending is so abrupt it lacks any real impact (so everything is better now?).  Alas, I didn't expect a whole lot, but the theme song (Get the First Train out of Town) is a fun little number that represents that teenage era well.",1392768000,,990,4.417582417582418
8440876,4,B004TTOQBC,"This is James Darren first movie. Supporting : Robert Blake

I was wondering about this (for me unknow) movie. It is in black and white and letterbox 1:1,85. When you've a 16:9 TV and fills your screen full.

The Picture quality is not perfect but pretty good (for not restored / remastered). The Soundtrack is in mono.

Subtitles: none

Story: Based on the novel Rumble on the Docks by Frank Paley (New York, 1953) and was filmed on the docks of San Pedro, CA.

Fazit: Its a entertaining B-Picture",1314230400,3,498,4.550561797752809
8440877,4,B004TTOQBC,"This is James Darren's first movie.  Columbia took a chance on an unknown inexperienced actor and it worked.  James is fine in the role of Jimmy Smigelski, the leader of a teenage gang, who gets mixed up with racketeers.  Robert Blake gives good support as Jimmy's friend, Chuck.  Laurie Carroll is something of a weak spot, but other than her the performances are all good.  The DVD is done in letterbox format and my purchase only took from Thursday till Monday.",1308787200,4,464,4.679012345679013
