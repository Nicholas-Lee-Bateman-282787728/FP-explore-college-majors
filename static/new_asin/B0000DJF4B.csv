8001213,3,B0000DJF4B,"The only reason I even decided to keep this movie is because of Kim Won Jin,an awesome kick master in all the movies he's played in. The movie itself is pretty bad and very degrading for women. Story? Tamara Guo comes to Hong Kong with her lover as a martial arts champion in hopes of finding success. Instead she gets placed in a life of prostitution, drugs(heroin addict), and betrayal from her lover. Pretty soon, serious legal matters put her in jail where she meets two cops who are having an affair, played by Benny Lai and Farini Cheung Yui Ling. Benny is a crooked cop working with an underground drug group leader KK played by Won Jin(he's always the bad guy, sigh).Lai convinces Cheung to go undercover to spy on KK and to use the prisoner Guo for help. Lai's plan is to frame the two women so that KK and Lai can break away clean with dirty money. Anyways the women will figure this out and plot revenge. Very twisted plot indeed. As I said, the only reason to see this is for Kim Won Jin because his scenes are awesome where he just kicks the hell out of everyone. This guy is so fast and so flexible, and I merely watched the film to see more of him. Guo and Cheung are just OK, but some of their moves were pretty impressive. The director Corey Yuen got the best out of the actors and actresses in terms of fighting and acrobatic capabilities. The problems with the film lies with the content...this is not for minors due to the nudity, sex, and mildly graphic rape scenes. Most of it was really unnecessary and extremely distasteful (especially the rape scenes). There's even animal brutality (suggested, not real) in the movie where there was absolutely no point for it. Bleh. I don't know why Corey Yuen,usually a great martial art film producer, decided to go Wong Jing style with all this women bashing. So why the three stars? Kim Won Jin. I would've given this only one star if he wasn't present. By the way, the way they ended this movie is total crap...good job Corey Yuen (pshh).Well, definitely worth a viewing if you can handle the sexual brutality because Kim Won Jin is awesome as usual. I wish he could've been the main character in this, but oh well. As of right now, there is one version of the DVD out and that's the one you see above. There's some subtitle and lighting problems, but one can manage, and besides, the movie is cheap. For more Won Jin films, definitely check out Operation Scorpio, where he also plays the bad guy (sigh). For other martial art recommendations, check out my other reviews. Thanks for your time.",1087344000,10,2558,4.4796573875803
