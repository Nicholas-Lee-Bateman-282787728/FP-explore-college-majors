8227720,4,B000XBE3BS,"I have finally got a hold of this film! While not in the best quality version, the films holds up well for this brand regardless of the sometimes switching of dub to sub soundtrack (so have your subtitles turned on). It usually lasts briefly. They do that because they inserted cut scenes back into the film that were cut from the earlier version, and they ended up not getting dubbed. Duel for Gold is entertaining with its 2 female leads, hunger for gold and greed mission! Bloody action, more of a wuxia than a kung fu movie brawler, but entertaining. Decent good story, another classic for the Shaw collection. People that watch these know what to expect, I won't go into super detail, but if you're a collector of these films this one you should get before it's gone.",1395360000,,772,4.561151079136691
