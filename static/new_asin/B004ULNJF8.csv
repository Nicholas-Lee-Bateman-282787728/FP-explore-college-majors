4467506,3,B004ULNJF8,"Jason Statham is one busy dude!!  As many movies this guy is spitting out within the year, quality is bound to take a ride on the backseat!!!  With this said, BLITZ is borderline straight to DVD quality. The only factors saving it is the random action and its main cast of Jason Statham, Paddy Considine and Aidan Gillen.  All three give strong performances which hold your attention throughout the movie.  What hinders the movie overall is the ""been there, done that"" plot of loose cannon cop with total opposite partner and the pointless and useless side story of characters we really don't care about but somehow get tied up to the main story.
If you've seen the original DIRTY HARRY, you probably will be disappointed by this film because it simply can't compare.  If your a Statham fan, by all means watch the film and see him do what he does best, but for the rest of you this movie is at least worth a rental.",1314230400,,916,4.493975903614458
4467507,4,B004ULNJF8,"Blitz was a very entertaining film and had an old school feel to it very much like an old Charles Bronson revenge flick but with a fresh take.
Jason Statham plays 'Brant' a bad a** cop with not many if any limits when executing justice and he teams up with Paddy Considine 'Nash' who is a gay cop who has somewhat of a sordid past. The two get on well together after the gay ice is broken. They of course have to throw in a couple of cracks about Nash's sexuality such as phoofer and pillow biter. Once the ice is broken and trust established between Nash and Brant the gay thing doesn't come back up and he's treated as he should be ,a good cop,thankfully.
They are on the trail of a brutal cop killer and there are a few surprises thrown in along the way. I really liked it and thought the ensemble cast was excellent. The villain is a particularly dislikeable character and you will be glad you're on the hunt 'via this movie' with the detectives. Somewhat your typical Statham fare but much more interesting than some. two thumbs up.",1314230400,,1037,4.350515463917525
4467508,5,B004ULNJF8,"So, as the description says, Blitz is about a pair of English cops tracking down a serial cop killer. Jason Statham plays a bad ass with a propensity towards violence while Considine plays a gay cop who also has some past anger issues. They are paired up to track down the cop killer, who is flaunting his ""bad behavior"", but is smart enough to stay one step ahead of the police.
Statham's character in particular was spot on. Some of the ways he handles things, whether through direct stomping or fairly direct threats that you know he will follow through with, he has a way of getting things done, and reminds me of several people i know in real life.
The movie itself is fast paced, and deals with several social topics, from drug abuse and alcohol dependency to anger management to gay rights, and many moral issues along the way. For a short, fast paced, action type film really has quite a bit going on.
I would highly recommend watching this one.
Note: If you aren't from England, it may take a few minutes to get used to the dialect, as is always the case when you are used to American English. Not a big deal at all, and you get used to it quickly enough.",1314230400,7,1164,4.368663594470046
4467509,2,B004ULNJF8,"I like mindless violence as much as anybody. I first got started collecting Jason Statham when he was starring in the British ""ultraviolent"" movies.

Unfortunately, unlike those movies, there is no one to like in this one. Nasty criminals pursued (and beaten) by nasty cops. Sorry, Jason. Maybe another time.",1314144000,,308,5.16
4467510,4,B004ULNJF8,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict-- Based on the cover art and synopsis, Blitz looks like just another Jason Statham vehicle where our muscle-bound hero careens through London, bashing heads until he finds the killer. I was perfectly okay with that. Instead, Blitz is much more of an ensemble piece than it first appears. In addition to Statham's ""killer cop,"" we get his boss Porter Nash (Paddy Considine, The Bourne Ultimatum) a homosexual cop with a past; Elizabeth Falls, a friend who's just got out of rehab after a stint as an undercover drug cop; and Blitz himself (Aiden Gillean, The Wire), a compelling, smarmy killer who makes the perfect villain. It helps that all these characters are played by excellent actors.

More importantly, this cast of characters allows Blitz to tell a story that's a little more complicated than ""catch the killer."" Obviously finding Blitz is the central story here, but the film weaves in police violence and corruption, the media's complicity in that violence, drug addiction, homosexuality, and burnout. Of course the film doesn't have the most original things to say about these issues, but it's nice to see a cop film that isn't afraid to balance the action with a bit of intellect. The multiple storylines also allow the film to build tension in the main story. The audience knows who the killer is very early on (and the cops find out not much later). By weaving the other stories into the capture of Blitz, the film builds tension by not proceeding to the obvious showdown between good guys and bad guy. Still, it wouldn't be a Jason Statham film without him kicking in some heads and cracking wise. Blitz doesn't ignore those moments, offering some satisfying cracks from Statham, both physical and verbal.

Blitz comes to Blu-ray with a solid AVC-encoded transfer. The film was shot with a lot of wide angle lenses and the picture can get a bit soft around the edges, though that's probably a deliberate choice and not a failing of the transfer. In general, though, detail is strong, and colors are well-saturated. Black levels are consistent and deep, and grain crops up appropriately in a few places. The DTS-HD surround track is fine as well, offering clear dialogue from the center channel, and a bit of atmosphere in the surrounds. The low end gets some use, but not as much as many action films. Subtitles are included for those who have trouble with British accents. Extras include some interviews with the cast and crew and a roll of behind-the-scenes footage. We also get the film's U.K. theatrical trailer.

4467511,3,B004ULNJF8,"""I've got a name, Blitz as in Blitzkreig."" After a serial killer starts killing cops Tom Brant (Statham) begins to investigate. It is up to him to find and stop the killer before he strikes again. I will start by saying that I am a big Jason Statham fan, even though he plays the same guy in the same movie every time. This one is no different. Statham is the tough guy cop who plays be his own rules and gets what he wants. The one thing I will say about him is that he knows his limits and likes to stay in his comfort zone. That is not really a bad thing. This is a British crime drama and without a ""Hollywood"" feel it works and is entertaining. Nothing new or different in this movie but it is still very much worth watching. Overall, if you have seen one Statham movie you have seen them all. But no one can watch just one. I liked it. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I doubt it.

4467529,3,B004ULNJF8,"Take Jason Statham, put him in a perfect role as a by-the-seat-of-his pants cop with anger management issues, give him as good a supporting cast as you'll find in a B-movie, and add to that a script based on a popular series of hardboiled British cop novels, and the results should be dynamite. Unfortunately, ""Blitz"" is not nearly as explosive as the title, the cast, or the source material suggests, thanks to some rather lackluster direction by a relatively inexperienced director. So it's no surprise that ""Blitz"" sat on the shelf for two years before going pretty much directly to video, and it's equally no surprise that Statham and his castmates do the best they can with what they've got.

Statham plays David Brant, a maverick detective with a reputation for roughness who, as the film begins, is under investigation for beating up a group of young punks (the audience knows his actions were justified). But when a serial killer calling himself Blitz begins targeting cops, seemingly at random, Brant finds himself on the case with a most unlikely partner, Sergeant Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Nash, who is openly gay, is stuggling to win the respect of his fellow cops, but Brant isn't concerned about working with him, especially when he learns that Nash is prone to cut corners as well. Brant quickly discovers that Blitz is a petty criminal (Aiden Gillen) who has a grudge against Brant for hassling him earlier. Blitz proves quite resourceful when hes eventually cornered, and he is able to muddy the waters by claiming that Brant is still rousting him.

Jason Stathams admirers and critics both pretty much agree that you get about the same performance from him in every movie, and Blitz is no exception. Although physically he can be quite explosive, Statham rarely engages in rants and rages, so his Brant is pretty much reminiscent of Clint Eastwoods Dirty Harry, except that Brant tends to us his fists instead of a .44 Magnum. I haven't read any of the novels that Blitz is based on, but the character seems like he should exhibit more outward signs of anger instead of mostly sulking and brooding (which Statham does a lot during the course of the film).

Stathams co-stars do pick up a good bit of the slack in the movie, however. Youd be hard pressed to find a better supporting cast in this type of movie than Paddy Considine, Aiden Gillen, David Morrissey, Mark Rylance, and Luke Evans. Considine and Gillen are the most effective here, the latter livening up the film considerably as a deliciously over-the-top villain. Unfortunately, the movies best subplots are pretty much relegated to the backburner. Considines homosexuality disappears as a plot point after one scene when he catches grief from the other cops in the precinct. Similarly, a subplot involving Morrissey as a reporter with whom the killer starts communicating is potentially fascinating, but also gets dropped too quickly.

Instead, Blitz spends an inordinate amount of time following around a female cop (Zawe Ashton) with a substance abuse problem who also becomes a target of the killer. Shes not Brants romantic interest, and her storyline really just gets in the way of the main plot. Nor is the character all that interesting either. Instead, her storyline seems to be in the movie simply to expand it to feature length.

Blitz isn't a bad movie as much as one that should have been much better than what the finished product turned out to be. Fans of typical Statham action will have to be content with a couple of fairly brief sequences, one of them in the movies first five minutes or so. The serial killer plot has a couple of good twists (including quite a good ending), and Gillen makes for an entertaining lunatic, but the investigation itself seems a bit perfunctory. Throughout the film, I got the impression that director Elliott Lester simply didn't appreciate what worked in the movie and failed to exploit his strengths. As a result, Blitz winds up being nothing more than passable direct-to-video fare.",1471824000,,4020,4.897209985315712

4467553,2,B004ULNJF8,"Having never watched a Jason Statham movie before but based on the glowing reviews this received I expected a lot better.  The plot, such as it is, is riddled with holes and real actors, such as Paddy Considine, David Morrisey, Aidan Gillen and Mark Rylance are criminally wasted, whilst Nicky Hensons hard-assed superintendent is laughably stereotypical.  The characters are not just one-dimensional; they're paper thin.

But at least the 97 minute running time provides an opportunity for Statham to showcase his acting skills, running as he does through the whole range, from A to A-.  Eastwood showed how the renegade cop thing could be played over 40 years ago: since then weve had a plethora of sub-standard wannabees hissing their way through threadbare plots in pale imitations of the original.  Ill give Statham this, he does have screen presence: but he does so little with it that, by comparison, he makes set props appear animated.  Good actors may not have a lot of dialogue but still hint at an internal life; e.g. the aforementioned Eastwood or McQueen.

If anybody wants to see what Morrisey and Gillen are truly capable of when given a half decent, literate script that focuses on British crime, they need look no further than the TV adaptations of Mark Billinghams novels, Sleepyhead and Scaredy Cat, aired on Sky1 in 2010 as Thorne, with the ever excellent Eddie Marsan as a bonus.",1441584000,,1400,4.931914893617021

Why can we not have feel-good experiences besides as children at the movies any longer; for me most new movies are to be avoided never knowing what I'll see or hear next.  Stand up to Hollywood and tell them we don't like this crap, unless you do. Isn't there enough violence and sadness and strife in the real world; I want movies to be escapism, not the reality I live with daily and am saddened and disgusted by.
Negative 100 is my rating; so disgusted and disappointed that Mr. Statham, or any of the others, would even want to be in this thing, and that it could be thought of by someone in the first place.

4467640,5,B004ULNJF8,"Based on a Ken Bruen novel  honestly, thats all it took. Add Statham and it was a no-brainer  and not necessarily in the sense that youd usually conclude about that. This is based on one of Bruens London novels with recurring characters Brant and Nash. It works a lot better if youve already read the novels because the two actors really make the roles come to life. Theres a lot more going on here than in your usual Stath slugfest because of course, its Bruen.

Hes even got a cameo as a priest (which if you know Bruen is even more amusing).

The cast alone should have got plenty of notice from folks, but I don't get the sense that this made the splash it should have. Hardcore fans might have thought there was a little too much going on here. Highbrow types who overlooked it miss not only the two stars, but Mark Rylance as a cop broken down by sorrow, David Morrisey as a sleazy reporter, Aidan Gillan as a killer so repulsive you want to reach into the movie and wipe that smirk off his face  and perhaps best of all, Zawe Ashton as a cop whos losing the battle with her addictions in heart-breaking slow mo.

If youve overlooked it until now, give it a chance. Theres still plenty of action, grit and no rainbows or puppies in the ending. Youll enjoy if you like that sort of thing. I do.",1400544000,,1299,4.281632653061225

4467643,3,B004ULNJF8,"I like Jason Statham. He has a good screen presence and a natural ability in front of the camera. So how is it he too often ends up in these mediocre movies?

Here's the scoop. Statham plays a violent police detective that also happens to be very good at what he does. His department is in a fix because someone is targeting the police and systematically killing them off on by one. Statham's new boss is a homosexual which opens up other problems as the two team up to bring the killer to ""justice.""

As I said in the opening, this is total mediocrity, and it's a shame because there is so much to work with here. Even a hack level Hollywood flick, using the same ingredients, would have spent more time developing the relationship between Statham and his boss. Of course they're at odds to start off but most films would have worked at their coming to terms with each other at the end. Here, it rather just happens. Then there's the black, female cop. Her undercover work left her a junkie who is now trying to straighten out and make sergeant. They needed to give her way more room to develop. I'm glad they  didn't make the killer too clever but, in doing so, they merely made him skin deep.

They do give Statham some good lines and he chews them up with fervor. The directing and other production values are on par with the content, but there just isn't anything new happening here. This fails at the script level. I really wish someone would come up with a better vehicle for Statham. He deserves better than this. If you need to see every movie he's ever made, have at it. If not......skip it.",1394409600,,1601,4.398648648648648

4467647,4,B004ULNJF8,"Jason Statham is at turns a film superstar and a cult item.  His films routinely gross domestically around $20,000,000.00 but he also has a huge international following.  His everyman tough guy appeal follows in the tradition of McQueen, Bronson, Marvin, Stallone, and Willis but he also has a distinctive Cockney mojo going.  The secret of his success is he picks his projects and collaborators well.  ""Blitz' is based on a book by noted British crime novelist Ken Bruen whose previous work ""London Boulevard"" was adapted to the screen starring Colin Farrell and Ray Winstone.  My quibble with this film is it's a tad derivative.  Scratch Statham's maverick Sergeant Brant and you get Clint Eastwood's Inspector Harry Callahan.  Even the plot involving a serial killer of police officers mirrors that of ""Dirty Harry"".  Regardless, as formulaic as this enterprise may be it is engaging with a good supporting cast notably Paddy Considine as a gay police inspector and director Elliott Lester expertly captures the grunge of Southeast London.  Suffers only in comparison to some of Statham's better efforts.  The violence on display here is quite brutal so those of weak stomach be forewarned.",1389916800,5,1193,5.166666666666667

4467651,5,B004ULNJF8,"Ken Bruen is one of my favorite authors, so I knew it was going to be hard for this movie to sell me on its merits. I was blown away by how good the film is and how great a job it does in taking Bruen's unique writing style and convey the same type of flow through the proficient use of cameras, angles and skips in action.

Jason Straham is an excellent choice to play Brant. He really looks the part of the ruthless cop that does not have many scruples. I also liked the actors selected to play Falls and Roberts, and their performances were proficient. The story is dark as is usually the case with this author, and it flows easily and keeps us glued to the screen.

If you have read the book, you will notice that there are some minor changes in the story and a couple of major ones. One of those does not hurt the movie at all, but in my mind it would have been best if they had not changed the other one. That being said, the choice used in the movie still works wonders.

I only have one thing left to say. If they can bring more of Bruen's books to the screen with this type of quality, I will be eagerly waiting for the opportunity to watch more efforts like this one.",1388016000,3,1177,4.064655172413793

4467670,4,B004ULNJF8,"Why did I watch this?  Because I wanted to see a gritty Jason Statham kick some heads.  Did I get this?  Yeah.

Statham is after a criminal and the police are busters because they don't really have any leads.  But as the investigation unfolds and we find actor Aidan Gillen (whom I recognized but couldn't place--when I was able to place him I realized it was he in the lead villain role in Jackie Chan's Shanghai Knights--he was short of stature but played smug and slightly imperious very well) as the homicidal cop killer, all crick-necked and off-kilter demented, he seems both less than a match for Statham's thuggish cop and his well-coiffed partner who is supposed to make Statham's character a little uncomfortable because he's homosexual (though never aggressively so).  As the film plays the partnership out the truth for both of them is that they're a bit of outside within their own policing world but they make a good team as they are determined to catch the killer.  You know how it ends.

Along the way we get a sub-story of a multi-faceted junkie cop that the film helps us develop a really sympathy for and this gives the film more emotional depth.  Of course the criminal has past unexpected ties to Statham's character.  Part of the fun is seeing what this was and how it plays out in his character but...he ends up being pretty one-note.  Still, an enjoyable film and a good (though not great) vehicle for Statham, Gillen, and Zawe Ashton (the junkie cop).",1380931200,,1476,4.66023166023166

He has the $50k that he took off the junkie he killed with him when he's arrested.  That's more than enough to arrest him for at least one account of murder.  And all the evidence they need is in his house, which for some reason they just don't search.

Statham: Pretty much the same in every movie, which is why I rented it.

Paddy Constantine: The gay cop. Not sure why gayness was even mentioned. Likable guy. I figured since the synopsis included the gay issue it would be an annoying part of the storyline, dwelling on it too much. However, it's not really a significant part of the movie.

Aiden Gillen: The villain. Someone you can easily hate.

Story: Cops after a cop killer. Also, a side story that really didn't seem to fit but did not detract from the movie.

Ending: I liked it.

I watched 'Blitz' not particularly expecting that much, but enjoyed it from start to finish. Good plot, good characters, great London locations and a film that doesn't pull any punches and does what it says on the tin. We want action, and that's what we get!

What a creepy theme for a film. The acting is excellent, the plot okay but quite thin, the action sometimes exciting.

But thematically this is foul stuff indeed. It seems like the kind of movie they would show in Nazi Germany or fascist Italy. Or, I guess, Britain and America today.

Naturally the cops can't get any good evidence and he is let go after Statham brings him in.  Him and his partner finally decide enough is enough after the victim count hits around seven.  If you enjoy good cop movies you will more than likely enjoy this one.  Great rental price and decent purchase price on it right now.

4467714,4,B004ULNJF8,"Jason Statham has established himself as the premiere action star of generation X and he shows why in Blitz! Unlike many of Statham's films, this one isn't just about shooting people, it's actually a great thriller, about a serial killer in London, who is targeting the police. That being said, straight action films are supposed to be exciting and fast paced, but when it's more of a thriller, it needs to slow down a bit. I was impressed by Blitz, but I honestly felt like I was watching the film in fast forward. Statham's character is also a bit of a change from what his fans will be used to. Brant is a crude, tough cop, who doesn't follow any rules and is actually quite funny. I honestly never saw Statham as someone who could pull off a role that involved humor, but he was amazing in this movie. His performance as well as that of ""the killers"" really enhanced this film. I'm most definitely an action junkie and I've seen quite a few Jason Statham films, and I can honestly say that this is the best one I've seen. The action scenes are intense, the story is intriguing, and Statham's character is the kind of cop that audiences will fall in love with. Action is a very repetitive genre and it's truly refreshing when you find an action film with a big star and great story attached to it.",1361491200,,1300,4.420833333333333

4467727,1,B004ULNJF8,I bought this movie without watching it first.  I enjoy  and watch most of his films numerous times.  This is Statham's worst film and maybe the worst film I have ever watched.  Low on action.  Smaller plot lines within the movie went nowhere.  Waste of money and time.,1350345600,,269,4.5
4467728,3,B004ULNJF8,"As a fan of action film star Jason Statham( Transporter series etc) I had seen most of the movies in which he starred in, but I had never heard of the movie Blitz.  After purchasing and viewing this DVD I realized why I had not seen this movie advertised at any major U.S. movie theater.

 This is a British made police drama and even though Jason Statham was the star in the film, there was very little action showing his incredible physical skills and fighting ability.  Further, the only real shooting of a gun was done by the cop-killer.  In fact, the political correctness and dislike of guns by the Brits was easy to spot in this DVD.  As most people know, most British police officers do not carry guns and even our hero SGT. Brant(Jason Statham) did not carry or use a gun until the end of the movie when he took it away from the cop-killer with the use of a tire iron.  At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be an action packed film with Brant using a hockey stick to beat up three car thieves and than being chewed out by his boss for using excessive force.  However, as it turned out, a deranged psychopath began killing police officers who he had contact with in the past. The remainder of the story showed Brant and other British officers investigating the cop killings and finally getting him at the end of the movie.

In conclusion,  if you like police dramas you might like this film, but if you are seeking fighting and shooting action scenes, forget it.  There is one other thing that you should be aware of, you might have trouble understanding some of the dialogue because of the British accent.",1349827200,3,1629,4.3966666666666665

4467730,5,B004ULNJF8,"BLITZ is very much worth watching. Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.

Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.

BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast. Very much worth seeing at least once...Grady Harp, September 12",1347321600,6,2269,4.6
4467731,3,B004ULNJF8,"The movie starts out with some thugs breaking into a car. Jason Statham does some illegal high sticking as he subdues them. He is a vigilante cop molded after Dirty Harry. The newspapers are crucifying him in the headlines, and he is nearly out of a job in London. Soon a cop serial killer (Aidan Gillen) appears on the scene. We know he is the killer as does the police. One of his killings is done in broad day light, yet they have trouble arresting him, even after they search his flat. And what was with the fat chicks dancing pretending to be sexy?

We have seen rogue cop movies before and generally like them. This one brings nothing new to the table. If you are a fan of Statham's deadpan approach you might enjoy this film. Personally I felt, been there, done that, got the t-shirt while watching this film. The movie was boring even as Jason was shooting the bad guys in the head.

It starts off with a nice butt whipping so it caught my attention. The rest of the movie runs a bit slow and has a lot of character building. There is a good amount of cold blooded murder, ass whipping and a killer you may call barely believable but passable for the limited imagination this movie has. I do admit I did like the ending even though you can see it coming a (Kilometer) away.

4467740,4,B004ULNJF8,"Like many people, I've been a Jason Statham fan since the Transporter, so if you like Statham's other movies, you'll probably like this movie, though this is a little more gritty and less humorous than the Transporter or Crank.  The plot here is fairly formulaic - a serial killer is targetting police officers in a large metropolitan area.  Based on information provided by a police informant, Statham's character is provided with a suspect and Statham's character soon figures out which officers are being targetted and why, but can't prove anything.  Eventually the police set a trap and deal with him.  One sub-plot includes a policewoman who was undercover and became a junkie and is now back on the forece after getting out of rehab.  However, as the pressure mounts,she starts using again. Another sublot is a rivalry between the police who are responsible for the high-end neighborhoods and those who are responsible for the seedier parts of London.  The plot is fairly formulaic and derivative of other dramas, with bits from Dirty Harry, Nighthawks, and other police dramas thrown in.

The interesting part is that the story is based in London, so we get a bit of a UK perspective.  The slang and the accents are difficult to follow and I strongly suggest viewing with the subtitles on.",1324771200,3,1296,4.912844036697248

Underscoring the film is a poorly defined connection between Statham and Gillan's characters.
BLITZ is a strictly adrenaline-propelled movie, not really breaking any new ground and suffers from the thick accents that often become undecipherable.
Statham has a strong screen presence and Considine is effective, making BLITZ an okay actioner.",1324080000,2,601,5.122448979591836
4467743,3,B004ULNJF8,"Two police detectives, one straight (Jason Stratham) and one gay (Paddy Considine) team together to catch a serial killer of police officers. (I'm not certain why one is written as gay, since there is nothing to indicate this other than a few homophobic remarks, written or spoken, which have nothing to do with the plot itself. It's all back story. It might have been a more interesting acting stretch, too, if Stratham had played the gay cop and Considine the straight one.) Nonetheless, both actors shine in their roles, as does Aidan Gillen as the sociopathic killer. This movie also features a fine ensemble cast, including such British stalwarts as Mark Rylance and David Morrisey, and newer star Luke Evans. The movie's ""message"" seems to suggest that for some crimes, rules are made to be broken. To put this another way, it promotes vigilanteism.",1322438400,2,855,4.944444444444445
4467744,4,B004ULNJF8,Actor Jason Statham lays off the marshal arts gymnastics and takes an excellent thespian turn as Brant a detective who becomes involved with a cop serial killer played with just the right amount of sleaze by Aiden Gillen.  Statham teams with another officer played by Paddy Considine to take him down dodging the obstacles placed in front of them by their own judicial system.  Director Elliot Lester gives the film a gritty look showing the downside of the British scene resembling Director Harry Barber's excellent Michael Caine film 'HARRY BROWN'.  It's good to see Statham in a different light and is a must for all his fans. This version from Millennium Entertainment that I viewed releases the film in a crisp 2.35 transfer with no extras.

4467747,3,B004ULNJF8,"""Blitz"" is a UK crime thriller starring Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") as Detective Sergeant Tom Brant, a tough cop with a vigilante streak. With recently-transferred Sergeant Porter Nash (Paddy Considine), Brant hunts down a serial cop killer who calls himself ""Blitz.""

As far as the story goes, ""Blitz"" adds nothing to the ""rogue cop"" genre. The film looks like a belated answer to Clint Eastwood movies, with none of the latter's skills necessary to get the viewer involved with the characters. The narrative is often flat, and the pace is not so much as ""fast"" as ""rushed.""

""Blitz"" attempts to include so many things in its short running time that few of them are really interesting. Issues such as media responsibility and moral ambiguity are barely touched upon, while the film's content clearly raises questions about them. As a suspense film, the identity of the killer is revealed to viewers early on, which in itself is not a bad thing at all, but the process of the police investigation is rather sketchy and dull.

""Blitz"" could have made for a more compelling thriller. The London locations serve well as a backdrop against which the thin story is told. Paddy Considine turns in a fine performance as a by-the-book officer with a past. And, well, Jason Statham is always good at being Jason Statham. The two leads are very effective.

But those episodes involving a newspaper reporter Harold Dunlop (David Morrissey), who is approached by the killer, are underdeveloped. Also, the subplot about a former undercover police officer Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton) goes nowhere. Almost no attempts are made to make them interesting.

""Blitz"" is a nice throwback to the classic movies like ""Dirty Harry"" and ""French Connection,"" but lacks the charisma and energy of Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman and their movies.",1318636800,,1827,5.0364238410596025

4467751,4,B004ULNJF8,"A throwback to the hardcore 70's crime drama. Street level thugs and street level cops - neither of whom are playing by the rules. This fantastic retro vibe is recreated in 'Blitz'. It's a difficult style to film and I've seen it done with this level of excellence in just a handful of movies, the Mel Gibson film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Payback/dp/B000M3439O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Payback</a>' being one.

Muted colors and harshly lit scenes are a true flashback to movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enforcer/dp/B0015XHQTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enforcer</a>' - a grisly look down into the ugliness of dark alleyways and dingy backrooms. No beautiful runway model crime scene investigators, no rock-n-roll themed music, no happy family waiting at home.

Whiskey, harsh flourescents and a couch are all that await you - the job is everything because you have nothing else.

Boiled down, 'Blitz' is an ol' fashioned good cop/bad cop dynamic. Jason Statham's brutal street cop, Detective Brant pushed to work with Luke Evans' gay by-the-book office cop, Detective Inspector Stokes. Extreme polar opposites who recognize that they need the other's divergent skillset, forcing them to put aside their differences in order to catch a psychotic thrill killer.

Part of the fun is watching them warily test one another, the slow recognition that each is a good cop in his own way. Finally, that bonding of partners that will cement them as buddies over the course of events.

Finally, I would like to praise Aiden Gillen. He seems to be one of those actors that can only portray nutters - it's something in his eyes, that weird glint, that touch of madness. I have doubts that he can play 'normal'. But I give him props for doing crazy well; it can be a career maker for some. I'm still hopeful he'll be able to break out of the pigeon-hole, e.g. Dennis Hopper or Malcolm McDowell, and eventually get to work on straight roles, because I really enjoy his performances.

My only complaint is the police officer character played by Zawe Ashton. On one hand I sort of got it. But on the other, her character seemed like it was written for a more integral purpose in the original draft of the script, but later revisions/edits moved beyond and she was left behind. Or worse, because her plot line was in the source novel, the filmmakers decided they 'had' to include it for the movie. Unfortunately, her excellent and sincere portrayal felt misplaced and oddly unfinished in the film. I think 'Blitz' would've been a tighter project without the extraneous drama and pointless drug fueled sub-plot.

Flat out fun if you're into these kinds of retro cop rumbles. And to be blunt, I want more of this from Statham = Kick ass, no apologies.

Jason's the top action hero in the movies today and I hope to see more like this from the man. Especially from UK productions where there seems to be a harder edge to his work, it's an energy his more processed US productions don't always capture.",1316390400,,3087,5.1232604373757455

4467755,4,B004ULNJF8,"I consider myself a Jason Statham connoisseur.  I enjoy most of the movies he's been in with the exception of ""Revolver"" which I found to be too darn bizarre (I understand the movie, but it was executed all wrong by Guy Ritchie).

Based on the negative reviews here on Amazon I dived into this movie expecting the worst and instead I was pleasantly surprised by how great this movie was for being a relatively low budget UK import that skipped theaters here in the States.  I'll get this out of the way: This movie doesn't have the non stop action of a Transporter or Expendables flick.  That's not to say there's no action or that's boring (it's not), but it doesn't have the over the top choreographed action that are a staple of many of his movies.  However, Statham is still a bad ass mo-fo in this flick.  He's a pissed off cop with his hands tied behind his back because he's under media scrutiny after using force against bad guys while off duty.  Because the movie attempts to stay somewhat grounded in reality it would be silly for his character to be fighting ten guys at a time, getting into unnecessary shootouts, car chases and blowing up buildings.  Statham does kick ass when appropriate and it is always appropriate and satisfying.  Statham's character isn't up against a gang of mercenaries or the Chinese army, he's pursuing one maniac, thus the ""lack of action"".

Also, the bad guy in to movie was Tommy Carcetti in ""The Wire"" and is Petyr Baelish in ""Game of Thrones"".  So not only do you get Statham playing a restrained badass, you get the mayor from The Wire!!  And he's F'ing crazy in this movie!  How could you not appreciate that?

If you don't at least somewhat like this movie you were raised by over protective parents and still suck your thumb when you go to bed at night.

4467757,3,B004ULNJF8,This is a movie to watch if you have time. It misses all the fight and action figures of Jason S. from his other smilar movies but it is a good movie to watch during a plane trip when there is nothing else to do.,1315440000,,212,3.7333333333333334
4467758,1,B004ULNJF8,"I like action flicks. I like Jason Statham.

This was not an action movie. The first 2 minutes of the movie had more action than the next hour and a half.

This movie was filled with pointless sub plots. The movie didn't make sense. You kept thinking, ""why did he do that?"" or ""Doesn't he have enough evidence?"" or ""that is just plain stupid.""

The dialogue was corny, cliche, and just plain dumb.

I think you could close your eyes, point at any movie in a video store, and the movie you select would easily be better than this.

Stay away from this movie. I don't know how anyone could give it above 2 stars.",1314921600,3,610,4.269565217391304
4467759,4,B004ULNJF8,"Pretty typical rogue cop handles crime his own way in this suspense film of a police serial killer with some revengeful issues he's aiming to satisfy. The film makes no effort to hide the identity of the killer but weaves it's story around a few of the murders and Jason's attempt to identify and find the killer. Pretty straight forward but what makes this film worth the time is the acting for all involved was good+ enough to be entertaining and engaging. To illustrate, visualize Jason's usual disheveled raw urban persona during his interview of a witness.  The witness asks, ""Ain't you gonna take any notes?"" to which Jason replies, ""Do I look like I carry a pencil?"" That sums up the movie but of course you have to see and hear it to appreciate it's import.",1314835200,,765,4.583941605839416
4467760,5,B004ULNJF8,"BLITZ is very much worth watching. Yes, it is another exploration of what makes a good and bad cop, but this time the story is so well told and the actors are so convincing that once this film has 'blitzed' by the viewer's eyes, watching it again will be an even more positive experience. Based on the novel by Ken Bruen and adapted for the screen with crackling dialogue by Nathan Parker, the story of the film is not so much one that is tough to follow - that's not the point - it is how the characters deploy themselves that makes it explode. Elliot Lester shows his mettle as an action director who understands character development and allows it to develop very naturally.

Detective Sargeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham) has his own way of catching and punishing criminals and his quick temper and disgust for perpetrators tends to make him act quickly and violently, a trait that gets him into trouble with his superiors. A serial cop killer who goes by the name of Blitz or Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) is out to kill as many cops as possible because of the way Brant treated him in a pool hall brawl a few years ago. One of the cops - Chief Inspector James Roberts (Mark Rylance) is victimized and put on leave and is replaced by gay cop Porter Nash (Paddy Considine). Initially at odds because of Brant's curt put down of Nash's lifestyle, the two finally join hands, discover why they are motivated to be violent from a very similar background, and the two set out to capture the Blitz. The media gets involved with reporter Dunlop (David Morrisey) from a tip from the serial killer who really is after fame. A sidebar involves a prior undercover cop in the drug world, WPC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton), who has her own personal bruises and joins in the chase for the killer with the apparent aid of DI Craig Stokes (Luke Evans). But just when these disparate cops think they have the serial killer Blitz under control, Blitz outsmarts them again until the well-staged suspenseful chase brings the film to a surprising close.

BLITZ is a yarn well told and well acted: Statham and Considine have great screen chemistry and the cameo roles are all molded to perfection by a very strong British cast. Very much worth seeing at least once...Grady Harp, August 11",1314576000,,2266,4.592592592592593
4467761,1,B004ULNJF8,Movie story dragged and did not take any real time to develop the characters. The show reminded me of watching a CSI episode at best.

4467762,3,B004ULNJF8,"After sitting on the shelf for past couple years (who knows why), Blitz has finally arrived here in the States.  Jason Statham stars as a take-no-prisoners British cop that gets teamed with a fairly straight-laced and loathed superior (Paddy Considine) to hunt down a vicious cop killer (Aiden Gillen).  That's pretty much it for Blitz in terms of story, other than a subplot involving a drug-raddled female officer, but for the most part it delivers the goods in terms of cop procedural.  Considering Statham's string of action films, Blitz is a bit different as it doesn't offer the kind of flashy action we expect to see Statham starring in, which is a good thing.  However, where Blitz falters is with its would-be examination of good and evil, combined with the fact that the film as a whole just seems to run about 15 minutes too long.  Those flaws aside, Blitz isn't a bad endeavor, and the main actors involved do quite well in their roles, so there's plenty worse films you could waste your time with.",1314489600,15,1010,4.715909090909091
4467763,2,B004ULNJF8,"If you're watching this movie because of Jason Statham, you should skip this one.  Filmed in England with an English cast, the movie is Bland at best.  The sound is horrible, the movie line is slow, and the action is none existent.  The movie jumps back and forth leaving you guessing what happened and why are these parts being shown.  The characters are out of place and you're left wandering, um... what?

Jason is less than ok in this film.  This is not a Crank equivalent.  This is a British movie gone horribly wrong.
Suggestion:  Totally skip this movie and save yourself 2 hours of sanity.  If you do choose to view it, be prepared to drink a lot and have your tv volume turned up SUPER high...  Made for TV or VHS at best.",1314489600,,731,4.348148148148148

The story takes place in London, so it was little hard to understand the characters, but we put the subtitles on, which helped a lot.  The hero in this movie was not a likeable character.  He harasses people around him, and is obnoxious most of the movie.  In fact, the villain becomes a cop killer because he was beaten badly by the hero of the movie in the past.
