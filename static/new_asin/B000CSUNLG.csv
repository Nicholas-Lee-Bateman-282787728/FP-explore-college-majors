2474426,4,B000CSUNLG,"Wow.  A friend and I watched this on network TV under a year ago.  Our mouths were agape at what unspooled before us.  Definitely cheesy, this is a tongue-in-cheek trashfest that knows exactly what it is and what it's meant to be- pure entertainment.  The plot is wafer thin, the setups ridiculous, and the actual shark attacks- WOW- so incredibly bad:  not one shark, not two, but HUNDREDS!!!!",1138320000,4,394,4.735294117647059

2474436,1,B000CSUNLG,"I felt that I had to force myself to watch this film to enable me to compare it with the genuinely frightening and almost unbearably tense Australian shark attack film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reef/dp/B004USUP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reef</a>&nbsp;that I have reviewed under that title. The concept behind ""Shark Attack"" is ludicrous. An artificial reef created off a Florida beach is drawing record crowds of sex crazy teenagers to that beach during Spring Break and threatening the business of evil entrepreneur Bryan Brown on another beach. As the teenagers appear to be more interested in sex and partying rather than diving over the new reef, I fail to see any logical reason for them abandoning Bryan Brown's beach. Brown chums off the competitor beach and we are led to believe that his chumming activities draw hordes of CGI Tiger sharks to the competitor beach where they begin to feast on a steady diet of teenagers. Finally, the CGI Tiger shark swarm attacks the teenagers close to shore and begins to consume them in massive numbers until thwarted by an amazing electronic device that has yet to be introduced as a safety device on beaches prone to shark attack. The acting is mostly abysmal, including that of Bryan Brown. Why the wonderful Kathy Baker agreed to take a role in this awful film escapes me. In one ludicrous scene, the heroine is surrounded by hungry CGI Tiger sharks. She is advised to remain absolutely motionless in the water to escape the attentions of the Tiger sharks that surround her. The advice works and the Tiger sharks swim away. If only this could really work! The beating of the human heart produces electrical impulses that can be detected by sharks as a source of food. Watch ""The Reef"" and see a real and very frightening Great White shark stalking the actors who appear to be actually in the water with it.",1310688000,,1915,5.101910828025478

2474438,2,B000CSUNLG,"As the title implies, Spring Break Shark Attack (2005) features sharks on lose, threatening the tourist crowd frolicking on the south Florida beaches during spring break.  The drama focuses on a small group of college kids who encounter sharks, greedy business interests, and a local sleazebag .  When a pack of hungry sharks moves into an area with plenty of young fresh meat to snack on, it isn't long before the sea runs red with blood, and panicking swimmers are screaming in fear.  This mass attack scene is way over the top, and the central characters are put in danger one more time, as they lead a pack of sharks out to sea aboard a rickety boat.

Shannon Lucio (Prison Break) at 25, seems a little too old for the role, of a Danielle, a girl who sneaks away from home, to joining her friends in Florida.  She gets involved with two guys, J.T. (Justin Baldoni) who preys on women like a shark, making a practice of slipping roofies to his unsuspecting dates, and Shane (Riley Smith) who works for a boat rental place.

Shark attacks are squeezed in between the budding twin teen romances, building up to the big finish.  Kathy Baker (Picket Fences) and Bryan Brown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-X/dp/0792845781/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F/X</a>) add some experience to the primarily youthful cast.  Baker is quite good, playing Shane's mom, the owner of a boat rental business at Seagull beach, and Brown has a minor role an unscrupulous  club owner looking to improve his business.

Although the plot isn't that substantial, Spring Break Shark Attack bloodies up the water and provides a few thrills.  The film manages to get things done featuring mostly stock footage of sharks, and limited special effects that mostly involve shark fins projecting above the water.  Shark attack fans may want to check the film on SyFy, before buying the DVD.",1286668800,,1897,5.044871794871795
2474439,5,B000CSUNLG,"I would like to start this review off by saying that SBSA is possibly the greatest cinematic creation of all time. To anyone with a negative comment about this movie, I just don't understand where the criticism is coming from. The special effects in this movie are absolutely outstanding, the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat, and the acting is top tier. I currently own a copy, and could not be happier. DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE! Order yourself a copy of this piece of cinematic gold and you will find yourself one happy camper. For only $12 this is an absolute steal! Now I know what you're all thinking, this guy is nuts how could ANY movie be that good, well do yourself a favor and put those concerns aside I give my own personal guarantee that you will NOT be disappointed (guarantee not valid). Srsly, top 1 movie of all time...if not better. How can  you NOT love spring break? AND SHARKS!! AND ATTACKS!!

2474440,1,B000CSUNLG,"Spring Break Shark Attack (Paul Shapiro, 2005)

There are good bad movies. We've all seen them, and we all have our favorites. (Mine? Night of the Lepus, Beware! The Blob, and Shriek of the Mutilated, among others.) But then there are bad bad movies, movies that aren't bad for any reason that makes them stand out, but are just collections of bad acting, cheap special effects, and predictable plot twists that are bad enough to be bad, but not bad enough to achieve that sort of glorious hideousness that makes a movie like, say, Kingdom of the Spiders stand out from the crowd.

So anyway, there's spring break. There are some sharks. There's a really, really hot lead actress, Shannon Lucio (Starkweather), and two guys who both want to get jiggy wit' dat (Eight Legged Freaks' Riley Smith is the good guy, The House Bunny's Justin Baldoni the bad guy). They all end up on a boat with some of the hot chick's friends when everything goes south. People, sharks, you know the drill.

In fact, you know the entire drill. I'd be willing to bet, if you've seen three or four movies like this, you can pretty much recite the litany of plot twists and be almost perfectly accurate. The acting is awful, the script doubly so. The only thing I can say in this movie's defense is that they didn't make the sharks superintelligent or genetically modified or anything else stupid. (half)",1248739200,,1379,4.64344262295082
2474441,1,B000CSUNLG,"Ok, I'm not going to spend a lot of time reviewing this.  Saw it on the Sci Fi Channel recently.  Much of the movie makes you forget it's a shark attack flick, when a love triangle becomes the main focus, complete with a date rape angle.  The really odd thing is that the 'bad guy' is portrayed as if the writers aren't sure whether he should be likeable or not.  The actors do a decent enough job, but given what they have to work with it doesn't save the movie.

Then there's the shark attack angle.  The sharks aren't badly done, and at least they don't ""growl"" as they do in most other SciFi shark flicks.  The exploding geysers of blood after someone is dragged below the surface had me laughing rather than horrified.

Oh, and once again, sharks are apparently strong enough to drag a boat through the water.  And this time, apparently they're coordinated and smart enough to all pull the chum basket in the same direction.

So what you end up with is a watered down movie with two completely separate aspects that don't mesh well together, and the shark attacks are poorly done.",1248480000,3,1085,4.461928934010152
2474442,4,B000CSUNLG,"but no more than it can handle.  I saw parts of this movie when it was originally on television.  What I saw made me want to see the rest, and I was glad I did.  It is a very entertaining movie - covering a lot of topics.  Yes, it has a lot of action with the massive shark attacks, but also has romance, humor and drama.  Worth watching.",1242777600,6,338,3.911764705882353
2474443,5,B000CSUNLG,"A fast moviing, blue sky movie with great looking people & beautiful beach and open ocean photography. Great fun.",1168387200,3,113,5.0
2474444,2,B000CSUNLG,"This seems like a movie that was supposed to be about teens going to the beach, getting drunk, and then having a date rape case for everyone to figure out.  Of course, if that sort of movie is going to have any dramatic impact at all, you have to have characters that someone could actually give a damn about.  This movie fails pretty thoroughly in that area, just like about 95% of movies these days.  Anyhow, at the last minute somebody apparently came up with the bright idea of making this a shark attack movie.  The sharks are barely in it at all, the date rape thing is really boring, the characters are paper thin cliches, and I personally couldn't care less if they got raped, went to prison, or if they got eaten by sharks.

This is just a cheap little made for TV movie (so forget about any nudity you were expecting to see).  It's bad, possibly trying to be so-bad-it's-good, but it fails at that.  I suppose it's watchable enough, I mean, it's not terrible, it just isn't much good.  Think season finale on Beverly Hills 90210;  That's basically what you've got here.  I could probably watch this again on some boring Tuesday night, but maybe that's just because it's so forgettable that I've forgotten how truly bad it was.

If you're looking for a cheesy shark movie, check out any of those Shark Attack movies.  Parts 1 and 2 are much better than this, and part 3 is so bad it's hilarious.",1155945600,6,1404,4.44140625
2474445,2,B000CSUNLG,"Made for TV movies can be fun, and if they're done with a proper amount of sophistication, worth viewing.  This CBS TV movie is not one of those however.  The sharks are hardly seen and when they are, it's not with any great amount of technical finesse.  As expected, most of the college students act like pre-schoolers and unfortunately most of them aren't good actors.  Shannon Lucio and Riley Smith stand out, but Justin Baldoni has little to offer but some nice pecs.  With the tons of shark attack movies available, why couldn't this one try a little something different.  And yes, I'll forgive the talented Kathy Baker and Bryan Brown for being the main adults in the movie.  Exposure is always good and so is the paycheck.",1143849600,8,729,4.6484375
2474446,1,B000CSUNLG,"this movie was broadcast on CBS tv.  I had to watch it, because I love TERRIBLE MOVIES.  no real gore, no nudity, very safe to watch but I have to give credit to CBS for actually trying to bring back BAD movies!--the SCI-FI channel is doing it and doing it BAD but BAD can be fun.  SBSA has all requirements(blonds, chicks in skimpy wear, no acting, no plot and no point).  CBS programming is showing various BUG movies and I have seen them too.  check your CBS listings periodically and you may find some PREMIERES? coming up.  why is this on dvd?---I have no idea but isn't the cover cool.  makes you want to throwdown 10 bucks -- just remember what your getting. ---- also, two other worthless movies that probably will come out too are VAMPIRE BATS and LOCUSTS(both starring LUCY LAWLESS) also CBS movies!! ps, this might be a good double flick with HAMMERHEAD-a true classic to come(read my review on that one too).",1142726400,3,920,4.506024096385542
