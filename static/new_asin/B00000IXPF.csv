1230256,5,B00000IXPF,This movie is so good that I watched it twice in a row.  The cast is uniformly excellent with Sam Shepard and especially Brad Rowe giving solid performances.  This is a fantasy Western that can also stand alone as a solid Western.  I wish they would do a sequel and take up with Brad Rowe's character.  I loved it!,1491436800,2,314,4.271186440677966

1230300,5,B00000IXPF,"One of my favorite all-time westerns, a mixture of reality and imagination. Well acted scenes of events which this movie depicts. Think of an out of the way town whose residents of this town called ""Refuge"",  were all long dead, Billy the Kid, Jessie James, Doc Holiday, Wild Bill Hickok [played by Sam Shepherd] and the other western legends in this town named [Refuge]  were not alive, Waiting to be judged by God, for admittance into heaven.  There was no jail and no one was armed.and  cursing was not permitted.
A gang of ruthless robbers and killers happen upon this town, and create problems with the supernatural residents who runn this town. The outlaw leader's nephew, who was also a ""Dime novel buff"" befriended one of the female residents  and fell in love with her. When he looked at the pictures in these dime novels he saw the resemblance of the Sheriff [Hickok] , the storekeeper [Jessie James] barkeeper [Doc] he put 2 and 2 together and knew what he thought was unbelievably true. I will not get into the rest of this story, but you will definitely enjoy it as I did.. Lotsa action and a wonderful surprise ending.",1485129600,2,1132,4.64

1230302,5,B00000IXPF,"One of my FAVORITE westerns and some great acting and realistic possibility.  Eric Roberts is one of the MOST UNDER Rated actors in the business.

The one person I'm not fond of, in general, is Eric Roberts but he is the definition of a really mean character here!  In one respect the movie is predictable but there is a surprise or two.

1230431,5,B00000IXPF,"This is an unusual as well as a very good western. It can be understood as a parable with each viewer seeing some different message in what is presented beyond the obvious. A large number of thugs escape from being pursued after a bank robbery and enter a strange town with no jail and no one wearing guns, even the sheriff. Some of the people look familiar to the thugs. We watch trying to figure out, before we are told, what is going on, who are these people, why do they act the way they do, who or what is the Indian sitting in front of the town. I enjoyed this film very much.",1448928000,,582,4.114035087719298

There is nothing wrong with the acting or the sets or the production. It is just that there no apprehension, no fear factor, nothing remotely gothic or scarey or eerie, and as such it builds no tension and creates no suspense or excitement. The most ominous thing we get are clouds and thunder behind the church. It comes off more like ""Angels In The Outfield"" than a thriller or chiller.",1413763200,,522,4.505263157894737

1230657,4,B00000IXPF,"This is NOT your typical western by any stretch of the imagination. I give this 4 stars primary because the storyline is so unique and the acting is better than most of these modern westerns. I guarantee that once you see this western it will stand out from all the rest. There are probably only two other westerns with any similarities to this, one being ""Gallow Walkers"" with Wesley Snipes. I don't give spoiler Alerts, so I will not tell you details of the movie. But if you enjoy a good western, than this is a western worth seeing. My last reason for why you will enjoy this film is the notable actors, Sam Shepard, Eric Roberts, Donnie Wahlberg and Randy Quaid just to name a few. And for the ladies you will find that typical western love story.",1408924800,3,752,4.41726618705036

1230663,4,B00000IXPF,"When an vicious outlaw gang rides into the quiet and oddly remote town of Refuge, it seems that Black Jack Britten and his boys have found a new place to plunder, especially since the townspeople are unwilling to stand up to the outlaws.  But there is something not quite right about Refuge, from its unarmed sheriff to its dandy of a doctor and educated storekeeper, to the habit of the inhabitants of filing obediently into church whenever the church bell tolls.  Sonny, the conscience-stricken nephew of one of the outlaws, is the first to figure out the mystery.  And Sonny will be the one to take a stand, on behalf of a young woman, against his own gang...

""Purgatory"" features a first rate cast for a television movie, with Eric Roberts and Peter Stormare as the baddest of the outlaws, and Sam Sheppard, Randy Quaid, Donnie Wahlberg, and J.D. Souther as townsmen with a surprising past, who will have tough choices to make.  To say more is to give away the key plot twist, but count on a terrific finale, including an epic gunfight, and an epilogue that make it all worthwhile.  For a television movie, the production values are solid.  Highly recommended as good entertainment.",1407888000,,1187,4.733009708737864

1230692,5,B00000IXPF,"One of the best movies I've ever seen!  A profound western.

Now, at the risk of sounding sanctimonious, let me tell you what I think is the most important message of this movie:  'We all struggle with the questions of how best to live our lives and how to know right from wrong.  To this end we seek guidance by reading books or by listening to others.  But - sometimes - if we listen very carefully, we can hear our best Guide inside our own hearts.'",1396742400,,452,4.209302325581396

Wild Bill Hickok (Sam Shepard), Doc Holliday (Randy Quaid) and Jesse James (JD Souther of music fame) all wait for the moment they're taken out of Refuge to finally make it to the ""Great Prairie in the Sky"".

A band of banditos with one not-so-bad bandito is nearby.  Sonny (Brad Rowe), the not-so-bad decides it's time to get out of the gang and mosey's his way over to the townsfolk.  Readily accepted to their bosom, Sonny helps put a stop to BlackJack's decision to take over the town.

As the story develops, one finds out that the people in the town are actually in Purgatory, where they are given one last chance to either go to heaven or hell.
Not everybody makes it to heaven.  the gangsters start creating trouble in the town, so several of them Purgatorians arm themselves to protect the honor of the young woman who is being abused.  They full well knew that putting on guns could cause them to lose their opportunity for heaven, but they put themselves on the line to protect the young woman.  After ridding the town of the gangsters, the story has an interesting twist as they are being summoned to hell.

1230755,5,B00000IXPF,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of westerns most of my life.  This is a made for TV movie but do not let that discourage you from seeing this unusual and unique western DVD.  This film begins with a bank robbery by a vicious group of very bad characters.  They end up in a shoot-out and ride out of town chased by the law.  They end up losing the money but most of the gang gets away from the law men.  As they are riding in any unknown area  they enter a fog and end up in a small peaceful western town called ""Refuge.""  Strangely, the gang is greeted by the sheriff, who is unarmed and extends a welcome to the group.  This is where the story becomes interesting and mysterious.

I never give away too much when reviewing a book or movie, which will spoil it for those who want to see this movie.  I will say that most of the top gunfighters of the old west (Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holiday, Jessie James and Billy the kid) are in this movie.  Like all good movies this one has all the ingredients of a unique and imaginative action packed western.  If you are into western movies that have an interesting twist and great characters, you should check out this movie.  I love this movie.

Now if I've got your attention and I hope I have, this is a movie that will keep your attention. The only thing I would suggest is that, you have your popcorn ready.

The actors, especially Sam Shepherd, Randy Quaid and Eric Roberts seem to be enjoying themselves and the story is well-paced.

1230837,5,B00000IXPF,"I think the best description I could give you in a nutshell is: The Wild Bunch Meet the Twilight Zone!  What happens is; a bunch of really nasty bad guys somehow go ""One Step Beyond"" and wind up in a very lovely town called Refuge.  What's so strange is that nobody seems to be wearing any firearms, and they only get up tight if you curse.  The baddies can't figure out just what this place is all about, but the nephew of one of the baddies isn't really bad and, because he's into dime novels, he recognizes who some of the residents really are.  I refuse to be a spoiler, so if you want to know how it all turns out, buy the DVD and see for yourself.  I remembered it from when it appeared on TV many moons ago, and I still like it.

It's like a fairy tale not for children. And the moral of the story is; everything is relative to motivation, and a pure and unselfish motive justifies all conduct. Moral relativism is something many people love or hate, depending on the circumstances, but few can ignore. Speaking for myself only, there is nothing absolute about this concept.

1230900,5,B00000IXPF,"Kudos to every aspect of this western!!!  Excellent script, directing, and acting.  fine performances from Sam Shepherd, Randy Quaid, Eric Roberts, and on down the line.

Purgatory is where gunslingers,bank robbers, harlots,  and other shady characters go after they die to earn their way into god's good graces.  How?  By becoming residents of a town called Refuge.  By becoming pacifists.  By resisting the things that their former lives were built around.  In short, by being good.  This is where you find Wild Bill (Sam Shepherd), Doc Holiday (Randy Quaid), Billy the Kid (Donnie Wahlberg) and many others.  This is also where you find Blackjack Britton (Eric Roberts) and his gang.  Except they are very much alive.  After a bloody bank robbery, they happen upon Refuge as they flee a posse formed to apprehend them.  They'd have been better off caught.

At first thought they believe they have found the perfect hideout.  but as time goes on they begin to expect other forces than simple fate are at work here.  Of course this all culminates in a showdown.  Nice twist and sub-plots are developed, with a stellar cast.  Excellent watch and addition to your western collection that you will watch time and again!!!",1348704000,3,1219,4.945544554455446

1230902,2,B00000IXPF,"I don't care about westerns and, when I found this on videotape and it was just a dollar or so, I wanted to try it out based on the mystical nature it described.

Outlaws, fleeing the law with money they stole from a robbery, come upon the the town of Refuge. That turns out to be a haven on the 'other side' where souls are waiting. Classic legends of the Old West are found there (like Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday). They want to redeem themselves for their actions while they were alive, so there's no cursing....fighting...etc. However, the town still has a saloon and one can get drunk. As well, there are guns and ammo (as we learn later) and it seems stupid that things that could tempt them to resort to their old ways, like in real-life, would be present.

The outlaws realize how nobody -- not even the sheriff -- carries a weapon and there's no jail. So, the town's easy for the pickin'. Eventually, when the entire town is in danger of destruction and bloodshed, the former gunslingers decide to defend themselves and the rest of the folks...knowing that it's going to mean they 'fail' and will be lost for eternity.

If it's a place for souls to be until they are ready for heaven (or hell if they 'fail'), there's no way that regular-folks should be there. The gang of desperados couldn't appear. That's something that will always be wrong with the story. I figured at the beginning that the gang was all dead when they came upon the town of Refuge and didn't realize it. It was what I thought because of the name of the movie + the town looked a bit eerie and the leader of the gang spoke of how they made a wrong turn or the wind made them get sidetracked (whatever).

So....the spirits of the famous gunslingers of the Old West take charge to defend their town from the living desperados. By doing so, an knowing what it means, they 'failed' and are to be taken to hell by an Indian spirit/man. However, before this, an old man in stagecoach comes at the last moment and tells them something like ""The Creator may be strict, but He ain't blind."" Thus, the four gunslingers get a reprieve, get into the stagecoach, and are taken down the road to heaven. The end. What did they all really do that was good? In their final actions, they killed humans that were somehow in the spirit realm and that's what they needed to do to 'earn' heaven? There's nothing we can do to earn heaven. The Creator said so; many of us are blind or deaf to understanding that. I guess we're supposed to think that because the gunslingers were protecting others and using their weapons to selflessly help instead of harm, unlike when they were alive, was enough.

Oh...and how about Sonny? He's one member of the gang who's pretty innocent and new to the group. He shoots & kills one of the men on horseback who shot him at the same time. Instantly, he spoke of how he's not in any pain and the sheriff welcomes him to Refuge. Sonny just died. Now later, at the stagecoach, he's invited to come aboard as well. Apparently, this was because he was the first one standing up to the desperados and protected the woman (spirit) he said he loved (though he didn't even know her) from gunfire. It's not clear to me, but I think that's the reason. He told the woman earlier that he killed one man who asked him to do it (we witness this happening earlier in the movie) and the second man he killed was the one who would have killed (???) the woman/spirit. So, both of Sonny's executions weren't acts done in revenge. He ends up choosing to remain in the town with the woman and becoming the new sheriff, knowing that -- according to the stagecoach driver -- he can leave when he wants.

VARIOUS OTHER THOUGHTS:

- When chiding the man about saying ""da*n"", I figure the sheriff shouldn't have repeated it. ""You said 'da*n' ... twice!"" To me, it would have been keeping in the character of the sheriff at the time if he said ""You said the d-word ... twice!"" This sheriff's time was almost up in Refuge.

- The residents of Refuge, since they aren't living-beings, couldn't be harmed by the humans. Before the final shootout, one mentions how if they fight, they lose (because it would mean they will be banished)...if they do nothing they lose (die? again?). If everyone there was a spirit, however, there'd be no flick. A western with all the bullets passing right through everyone?

- Why would the residents all go by different names? Who would care? They know who they are. There's to be no swearing in the town. The fact that they lie about who they are, well, that should be on the 'naughty list' too.

- When Sonny shoots and kills the man on the horse, why does the body just lie there? The dude's spirit should then be there -- just like with Sonny. He dies right away from that same man's shots and he doesn't fall, saying that he's not in any pain. Also, what about when the sheriff kills the leader ""Black Jack""? His spirit should then have appeared, too.

Yes, this is meant to be a western and a supernatural-type of film, obviously not meant to be taken seriously, but I want to mention that I believe the concept of purgatory is unscriptural. It implies that the death and resurrection of Jesus was not enough. To say such a thing and believe that we'll still need to be in a place of purification before heaven is insulting to why the Father sent Jesus here. Jesus' sinless life, sacrificial death for us, and resurrection is what was required to make is possible for any man to get right with God. ""It is finished.""

This is a silly flick and yet I found it okay to pass the time with. I liked most of the acting, especially the sheriff's; it moves rather-briskly; and I wasn't bored. A two-star rating seems generous.",1346630400,,5721,4.438095238095238

Since the beginning of time, humans have been concern with the afterlife.  What happens when we die?  If we are judged, what are the standards?  Purgatory gives us some answers.

The story is set in the American ""wild west.""  A gang of ""outlaws"" wanders into a remote town called Refuge, where it is so peaceful that the sheriff and his deputy do not carry firearms.  The sheriff invites them to stay awhile and says they are welcome to free drinks and rooms.  The only request is that they do not swear.

Among the peaceful people of Refuge are dead western legends Wild Bill Hickok (Sam Shepard), Doc Holliday (Randy Quaid),. Jesse James (J.D. Souther), and Billy the Kid (Donnie Wahlberg). Seems that everyone in Refuge was violent in their past but given a chance to redeem their pasts in Purgatory.

The outlaw gang enjoys the free entertainment but soon grows bored and decides they want more.  They are given some hints as to the nature of the town, like when one of them throws a knife at the sheriff in an attempt to kill him, but is struck by lightening  just as he is launching the throw.  Despite the hints the gang decides to assault the town and take whatever entertainment and loot they can.

The confrontation between the violent outlaws and peaceful citizens of Refuge is impressive.  The incidents after the battle teach the audience  about end of life activities and standards for avoiding Hell and obtaining Heaven.

I enjoyed Purgatory.  It does teach morals but in a way that is palatable.",1324166400,2,1514,4.670454545454546

1230935,3,B00000IXPF,"A bit more coherent than Dwight Yoakam's personal offering perhaps, but I am not sure 'logical' is a good thing when the subject is a Western set in the afterlife.  In any event, having loved ""SOHWOH"", I spent a good bit of my time while watching ""Purgatory"" trying to decide 'who copied who'.  ""Purgatory"" was released first (1999/2000), but my understanding was that Dwight had ""SOHWOH"" in his pocket for a good while before getting it made....so the question that was distracting me was not something I am going to be able to answer....but, I did reaize I was on the 'right track' when late in ""Purgatory"" I heard the gutteral utterings of 'Come On....', talk about paying homage.

Anyway, Purgtory had a great cast, but they all seriously underplayed their roles a bit.  I mean afterall, these were supposed to THE personalities of the old west; but they were certainly an understated group of BAD GUYS.  Given the subject matter, the film was certainly easy to understand (not a trademark of ""SOHWOH"" I might add), but that sort of made ""Purgatory"" come off as a bit of an 'immature film'.  I mean shouldn't something this fanciful be a bit theatrical?  The actors seemed to be portraying zombies rather than individuals still striving to get their journey 'to the light' completeted in a positive manner.  In order words, maybe the reason the film was so easily understandable was that the viewer had no trouble knowing the characters were dead....because they acted that part perfectly.

Watching ""Purgatory"" was an okay way to spend a Friday night at home.  Not too much stress on the gray matter, nothing exciting enough to get the keep you from relaxing after a week of hard work, and just enough story to keep you interested, even if it is only to consider the question of which came first ""Purgatory"" or ""SOHWOH"".

My conclusion:  If you disliked Dwight's tale, you will probably like ""Purgatory"" - and vice versa.",1311984000,2,1926,4.785498489425982

Much like the classic 'Twilight Zone television series a specific time period and a seemingly ordinary place serve as the setting for an extremely unorthox tale.

It is here that the world we know intersects with another and things are seldom what they appear to be. When a gang of outlaws ride into town they think they've come upon a place ripe for the picking and decide to take over and do as they please. Again, in the town of Refuge things are not exactly what they seem to be.

What I got by owning and viewing this DVD - (1) hell is a ditch where somebody is burning weeds, heaven is a stagecoach, and the gate keeper is a Native American Indian; (2) to move from purgatory to heaven you can't smoke, drink, cuss, or chew, or go with girls that do - and you can't carry a gun because you can't kill anybody (well okay . . . unless they REALLY, REALLY deserve it); (3) ""not rated"" means it was on TV so it's about as milquetoast as you're ever going to find in any western of any vintage all the way back past Tom Mix (violence, terror, or nudity? don't make me laugh); and (4) by the time the movie finally gets around to the gunfight, I didn't care if everybody died, as long as the movie was over.

Instead, ""Purgatory"" delivers Wild Bill Hickock, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid; not even carrying a gun, let alone willing to do anything whatsoever toward putting the town of Refuge back to safety and justice by dealing with Blackjack Britton - one way or another.

A gang of outlaws headed by the notorious Blackjack Britton lams out of town after a bank robbery and gets lost in a dust storm with the posse on their trail.  They take a wrong turn, evading the posse, and come upon a spooky little place with a gated entrance guarded by an ancient Indian, who turns out to be keeping more than one gate.  Was it luck or fate that brought them here?  The townspeople all seem peculiarly docile.  The sheriff wears a badge but not a gun.  And Sonny, the youngest of the outlaw band and addicted to dime western novels, not an outlaw himself but who went along for the ride with his uncle, one of the gang members, realizes that the sheriff is a dead ringer for Wild Bill Hickock and the sheriff's friends look exactly like Doc Holliday, Billy the Kid, Jesse James and Lefty Slade, all dead for years.  In fact, that's just who they turn out to be, and the town, called Refuge, is nowhere on earth, but is actually Purgatory, a mid-world created for people who are neither good enough to be admitted to Heaven nor bad enough to be condemned to Hell.  Purgatory is their last chance to set themselves right before their final sentencing.  But as the sheriff tells Sonny, Refuge is a place of hard rules: no cussing, no fighting, no rioting, no stealing, no violent outbursts no matter what the provocation -- and one of the sheriff's friends finds out tragically just what the penalty for breaking those rules is.

Blackjack Britton and his gang see Refuge as a place to cut loose and raise all kinds of mayhem, and for a while the sheriff tries to deal with the situation through polite admonitions.  But the sheriff and his friends realize that some evil is too entrenched to be dealt with by patience and docility, and sometimes one must resort to extreme measures, if not for his own benefit, then for the good of the people he must protect.  And who knows, maybe at times giving evil people a taste of their own medicine is justified.  As a wily old stagecoach driver observes, ""The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind.""

Uli Edel's direction and Gordon T. Dawson's script lift the movie beyond what might have been a banal western into the truly sublime, helped by a superb cast that includes Sam Shepard as Wild Bill Hickock, Eric Roberts in what may be his finest performance as Blackjack Britton, Randy Quaid as Doc Holliday, Donnie Wahlberg as Billy the Kid, J.D. Souther as Jesse James, Brad Rowe as Sonny, and Peter Stormare as Blackjack's henchman and Sonny's evil uncle Cavin Guthrie.  It's a perfect little gem of a western, of the kind they don't make any more, with the added treat of a tender love story running through it all.

DARK is precisely what this film is!  I was coaxed into watching it, and at first I thought I was in for the usual wild west mayhem.  Then the outlaws arrive in the town of Refuge.  Okay, the people seem a bit odd, it now begins to draw me in...and then the church bells begin to chime.  I have never forgotten those bells.  They creeped me out something fierce.

If I am watching it Mystery Science Theatre style, then you know I am bored.  But this film had me running silent for its duration.  This was a really wonderful film.  The acting was good, the special effects were good, and the disturbing factor was right through the roof.  It's not jumping out of your seat horror or anything, if you are expecting that, then you will be disappointed, but if you find that horror is more in things that make you think about your own fate, then this movie will leave you speechless.  This is one of those films that you will talk about after it is over.

It's fantastic, great film quality, scenes, and special effects (nothing outrageous or unbelievable)

great gun-play, knife fighting, and a true old-west feel... nothing sci-fi, like some of the reviews I've read.  Some people think religeous overtones is sci-fi ???  not at all...  it's just that religeous / spiritual overtones mixed with the appropriate special effects, and you get a very believable story that makes you think about your own life, and the meaning of life in general... you can't help but to think about life after death, because the movie takes places in the after-life of some of the worlds greatest gunslingers like Billy The Kid, Doc Holiday, Jesse James, Wild Bill Hickok, and more... sounds too fictional, huh?  Well, the script and the storyline itself, pulls it off without being too cliche or too Hollywood.

This was a TNT original movie and as such my rating would be 4 stars which is to say better than most TV movies.  However, by comparison to theatrical releases this movie pales and I can only give it 2 stars which is being kind.

I loved the cast, but the acting was surprisingly bland.  The script was not bad, but neither was it engaging.  The action was weak, especially the shootout at the end which was edited poorly.  The only thing I found that the movie had going for it was an insteresting premise which halfway through the movie had already grown old.

When I see 4 and 5 star ratings and I think of all the great classic westerns, this just doesn't measure up.  Open Range, a Kevin Costner Western that is just a few years old shoots circles around this one.

With its imaginative script, good pacing and excellent cast, this made for cable movie is quite good and entertaining.  A bunch of bad guys led by supreme baddie Eric Roberts and Peter Stormare find themselves in the town of Refuge, a quaint little town where the sheriff doesn't wear a gun and there's no cussing on the streets.  We soon find out there's more to Refuge than meets the eye and the movie climaxes with a big gun fight to rival the best.  Along with Roberts and Stormare, the cast is perfect:  Sam Shepard, the laconic sheriff; Randy Quaid, the kindly doc; singer John David Souther as the general storekeeper; Donnie Wahlberg as the somewhat feisty deputy; Amelia Heinle as the lovely Rose; and Brad Rowe as the naive member of the bad guys.

1231036,5,B00000IXPF,"PURGATORY in a western setting! It is a mind boggling concept.

And what a great way to think of that might have happened to our ""bad boys"".

Take a kid [Brad Rowe] who is not wholly ""bad"", still with a touch of innocence to slowly stumble onto what might be happening in the town of Refuge.

Eric Roberts made a great ""Blackjack"", a devil driven badass who was arrogant enough to think he can rule and destroy Refuge.

What a shock to find out was a ""Hell"" waiting for him.  Loved that scene.

It didn't take long to realize that Randy Quaid was ""Doc Holliday"" but I couldn't place the others until they were pointed out to me.

Sam Shepard as ""Wild Bill Hickock"" wanting only peace to finish his stay in Refuge was a wonderful, powerful character.  Especially when he faced down the knife throwers.  What retribution!

I loved the use of an Indian guarding the gates to Refuge and his removal of the bodies.  He was a great character.

The mix of spiritualism with the western setting and including falling in love, the driving force of the universe, is what helped to make this a great movie.  Not the run of the mill Hollywood tripe!

We get the feeling that God does love his creatures and is willing to forgive if we put forth the effort to ask for forgiveness.  And that He does reward man's acts of heroism put forth for those that can't defend themselves.

This DVD is well worth the money and can be enjoyed by all.

All the legendary names of the Wild West, including Billy the Kid (Donnie Wahlberg), Wild Bill (Sam Shepard), and Doc Holiday (Randy Quaid); all of whom attempting to redeem their souls for the acts committed while they were alive.  Naturally, a conflict ensues, with the townsfolk reluctantly resorting to the violent means they have been trying to erase.

1231043,3,B00000IXPF,"Alright, first let me say I enjoyed this for what it was - a Tv movie.  I liked the concept and the message enjoyed the overall execution, but a couple things really bothered me...
1. `Doc' John Holliday was a dentist, not a medical doctor.
2. Why did the gunfight at the end take place, when it was already depicted that the Higher Power would protect the town's citizens so long as they didn't resort to violence (remember when Sam Sheppard stands in front of the church door to stop the baddies from tossing their bowie knives?)?  And how could the citizens be harmed by the bad guys anyway, considering their true nature?
3.  So Purgatory is located just south of Sweetwater, Texas?  How could Ric Roberts and his gang ride into this place, and why didn't the posse follow them in?  Its hard to believe such a huge gang could give the lawmen the slip and not leave a clear trail for them to follow.
4. Why would such a formidable (and large) gang of bank robbers put all the money they'd just swiped on one horse?
Overall, as I said, I enjoyed this.  The actors all do a good job -particularly Eric Roberts, who was the biggest misgiving I had going into this.  He came off completely believable and seductively bad (which was good).  Donnie Wahlberg does a lot with the little screen time he's given, as does Randy Quaid and the fella who plays `JJ' (the storekeeper).  Sam Sheppard doesn't look a whit like who he's supposed to be portraying, but it didn't bother me.
I like the notion that `The marginally good' are given a chance to separated from `the totally wicked,' and I like the supernatural theme of redemption.  I thought the passage of the bad guys through the ghostly gates was very Twilight Zonish, and eerie, but I wish they hadn't shown us what was beyond all that smoke.  It kind've ruined the effect.
Overall, a good effort, worth renting, but I don't know about putting it up as one of the greatest westerns of all time.
If you wanna see a really stellar made-for-cable western, check out John Cusack, LQ Jones, and John Goodman in `The Jack Bull.'",1064188800,5,2072,4.498666666666667

1231052,5,B00000IXPF,"I think this will come to be considered the last mature, truly great western of the century of westerns. I've heard this described both as a ""metaphysical"" western and as a morality play. Maybe so, the really great westerns have always been about the eternal sruggle between good and evil, right and wrong. This film just carries it to a higher plane.

 I like the concept of men who walked the razor edge between Good and Bad being allowed one more chance to toe the line. There's alot about the character of Bill Hickok, Jesse James, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid that is not black and white- there's alot of gray.

 But, what happens when outside evil comes to Purgatory and you've sworn off violence forever? It must take a special kind of soul to disobey the Creator, even if it for a good cause, even when you know it means being cast into Hell....
I still get chills from that closing line, ""The Creator may be hard, but He ain't blind.""

Three things are guaranteed if you watch this film........1) you don't have to like westerns......2) the story will have you rivetted......and lastly, you will want to see it again, or I'll eat my spurs. I won't repeat the overview of the story which everyone has been so careful in outlining, as a careless word could ruin the superb surprises which it has in store. This film is perfect in so many departments with the acting coming top of the list. The wests most notorious gunmen are portrayed brilliantly by a cast who obviously believed in this film's message. The music is truly haunting and memorable, and in the tradition of all great westerns (which is the catagory where this belongs) there is a spectacular gunfight at the end, the build-up to which is truly masterful.

The only western movie I've ever really liked was Tombstone. So this has got to be a great movie.
The story is very interesting and the final showdown at the end is awesome. I don't want to say anything else because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.",1007251200,4,673,3.977777777777778
1231055,5,B00000IXPF,"As you can see from the past reviews, nobody has scored it less than 5 stars.  What an amazing movie!  It's too bad this didn't go to theatres first so it could be enjoyed on the big screen.  It definately deserves a transfer to DVD with all the extras so hopefully that will be coming soon.  I'm very picky about the westerns that I'll watch since a good one so rarely comes along these days.  But Purgatory is great!  Like others have said, it's a western with twists and surprises like no other before it.  And for ""Hollywood"" or TNT as the case may be, to put out a movie with a moral or faith based message, well that's just very incredible and very welcome considering the messages that are  conveyed in most movies today.  Purgatory is 5 stars and then some.  And at this price, you can't go wrong!",1001548800,16,805,4.306666666666667
1231056,5,B00000IXPF,"I am not a huge fan of Western movies but I decided to watch Purgatory because there was nothing else on TV and it was better than doing the housework that was for sure!  Boy am I glad I gave the housework a miss! What an excellent film!  It wasn't just a western but it was a love story, a mystery, a thriller, a bit of horror and lots of good quality acting. The storyline was fairly simple. A group of rowdy cowboys come across a small town called Refuge and they think that their luck is in.  It's run by a Sheriff who doesn't tote a gun, and the locals are wary of trouble to the point of paranoia.  Enter Sonny portrayed by the delicious young Brad Rowe as an idealistic young cowboy who is the first to realise that the town of Refuge isn't quite what it seems.  There are familiar faces in the town, faces that have been dead for many years and they're all pretending to be people that they aren't.  Sonny goes looking for the truth and in doing so falls in love with Rose a Refuge local played by newcomer Amelia Heinle.  In order to save Rose from the outlaws he has been travelling with Sonny must take on a band of vicious men, and make Wild Bill Hickok, Sam Shepherd at his best, pick up his guns once more even though it means a fate worse than death for him.  This is a great film, with a great storyline that is made even better by a strong cast of actors.  Look out for Donnie Wahlberg who plays Deputy Glen/Billy The Kid, he's an absolute cutie-pie!  It's not too graphic in the horror department so those who are squeamish can watch it without too much hiding behind pillows, and it has enough suspense for those who want a film with a little bit of a bite here and there.  All in all a really good film, and a western at that!!",997056000,145,1747,4.154302670623146
1231057,5,B00000IXPF,"I have been a Sam Shepard fan ever since that marvelous film:""Days of Heaven"", so when I saw ""Purgatory"" in the TV listings I decided to have a look (especially considering the unusual story-line.) I must say I at first had some trepidation about tuning in, because films with similar scenarios are filled today with such graphic horror devices.  (I've seen enough real horror, thank you.)I was pleasantly suprised!  A beautiful film about love, honor, and redemtive sacrifice; very well acted and filmed.  I would higly recommend it to western buffs, and devotes of the mystical, alike. Purgatory could provide endless hours of discussion in literature, philosophy and theology classes. But don't be put off by that.  The film never takes itself so seriously that it becomes boring or preachy. Having seen this now on TV, I am definitely buying a copy.",986256000,,853,4.985915492957746
1231058,5,B00000IXPF,"I'm a fan of ghost stories and had been expecting (and hoping) for something eerier.  Once the outlaw gang got to Refuge, however, my expectations and hopes were no longer important.  This is a lovely film, surprisingly (and refreshingly) free of the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-and-we-may-have-that-too motifs of sex, blood, more sex, more blood, lots of the ""F"" word, more sex, lots more blood, and (just for something different) bloody sex with lots of the ""F"" word.  I was stunned that the writers and producers managed to churn out a flick that was entertaining, comfortably familiar  and just a little unpredictable. You could share this movie with your kids, your Mom and Dad  and your aunt the Nun and not squirm with embarrassment. (Intelligent grown-up movies that you can watch with your kids!  What a clever concept!) I was reaching for kleenex during the last twenty minutes.  How nice to see that it is still considered courageous when someone chooses to make a tough, personally detrimental sacrifice in order to preserve the greater good. People here have been calling this a ""sci-fi"" film, but I think the classification is more ""religious fantasy with western overtones.""  Whatever the case, if you like westerns, if you like the pitting of good against evil, if you are sick of the blood, gore, swearing and sex that pass for action entertainment these days...and if you believe in something greater than yourself, then by all means, you should be watching ""Purgatory.""",985651200,5,1492,5.111111111111111
1231068,5,B00000IXPF,I just saw this movie on TNT and I think it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I only wish it was out on DVD!,980553600,,118,3.103448275862069
1231069,5,B00000IXPF,"There has been some complaining about Quaid in this one. AS near as I can tell, his portrayal of Doc Holiday fits what the real outlaw was like - surly, laconic,  and short tempered.
I have no complaints at all, except maybe it doesn't explain enough soon enough, however, patience has never been my strong suit.
The best part about this movie is that you can watch it with literally anyone (wife, girlfriend, friend, preacher, grandmother, etc.). It gets your attention and keeps it.
Some religionists may be put off by the idea that one's afterlife may be decided after death rather than before it. That's another thing I like about it.",980035200,4,638,4.696428571428571
1231070,5,B00000IXPF,"If you like The Twilight Zone or One Step Beyond and love a good western  with a message, this is the Movie to watch.  I first saw part of this movie on a TV rerun and was so intrigued by it I searched until  I found out what the title was. I have a collection of movies that I consider Classics and this is one of them. I hope it will come out on DVD.",973468800,,352,3.6666666666666665
1231071,5,B00000IXPF,"While the above information states the year 1999 for a release date, I believe that date is only for the release to video. I swear I saw this movie a year or two before then. Also, this movie is a TNT original, and I don't think it was ever in the theaters. But let me clarify, it could have done very well at theaters. This movie does not come across as 'made for television'. In fact, it is better than 95% of the movies currently on the big screen. I should state that, like many others here, I am not a big fan of westerns, and movies with religious undercurrents generally turn me right off. Thus, when my girlfriend wanted to watch this when it was first shown on TNT one night, I was not too excited by the idea. About 15 minutes into the film, my mind was totally changed and I was absolutely riveted to the screen. I was stunned by the subtle-but-immediate effect this movie was having on me. If my house would have started on fire, I don't think I'd have noticed.
This movie is pretty much impossible to categorize. It looks and feels like a western, but it's not. It also feels a bit like sci-fi, but it's not. Its message is deep and profound, but easy to understand instinctively. I've seen hundreds of movies, but I've never seen casting done this well before. All characters come across beautifully. This is not a huge-budget movie, Hollywood style, but you'll never notice the difference. I'm sure a large amount of money was spent, but this movie makes it due to stellar storytelling, great acting and wonderful direction, not big special effects. A powerful movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. No matter how old you are when you first see it, the story is likely to haunt you for years to come. A highly, highly recommended film.",970876800,80,1758,4.445820433436532

Because everyone loved it so much and I, myself, liked Tombstone and young guns...I gave it a try.  If you aren't big on  westerns, but like the historical figures...Jesse James, Billy the Kid,  Wild Bill Hickock, etc, then you will love this one.  I'm not a John Wayne  watcher, but the cast drew my attention.  They played the characters just  as I would have imagined them .  The cool part about this film is that  there's a major twist on the Tombstone type of theme...I won't give it  away, but keep in mind the title of the film.  I just loved the plot and  twists to an old story, and I think it's a great film that both MEN AND  WOMEN will sit down to and enjoy.

1231076,5,B00000IXPF,"I have been around long enough to comment on such westerns as ""the Rifleman, Bonanza, etc."" to be able to review this movie intelligently.  It is not often that you see a western that pits ""good  against evil"" and show what happens to those who lean towards the  latter.  What this western says, ""is that you can reform your life,  and win over evil."" Whoever produced and wrote this movie, deserves a  ""10 star"" rating.
