4588113,5,B0056G1AM0,It seems like Terry Pratchett movies keep getting better and better.  I had a copy of this movie shipped from over seas last year and it was worth every penny.  So you are in for a treat if you are new to these films.  If you enjoy this film I recommend Hog Father and The Color of Magic which each add an interesting tale to the fantastic disc world.  Keep up the good work Terry!,1310688000,6,381,4.04
4588114,5,B0056G1AM0,"In the city of Ankh-Morpork, all long-distance communication is done by the clacks (sort of platform telegraphs). But all of that changes in ""Going Postal,"" the third miniseries adaptation of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books -- this one poking fun at the postal service, with a charmining conman, a golem, and a ragtag band of postmen at the helm.

Moist von Lipwig (Richard Coyle) was a very successful forger, conman and embezzler... until the Watch caught him, and he was hanged for his crimes. Fortunately, he's not QUITE dead. It turns out that Lord Vetinari (Charles Dance) wants to give Moist a choice: he can die for real, or he can revive the moribund Post Office.

So Moist finds himself saddled with a decaying building filled with undelivered letters, two slightly insane postmen, and golem parole officer named Mr. Pump. And every night, letters force Moist to see the fallout of his past crimes, including a terrible one against the prickly Adora Belle Dearheart (Claire Foy), whom he is starting to fall for.

But the biggest problem may be the owner of the clacks, Mr. Gilt (David Suchet), who is willing to do whatever it takes to destroy the post office. Though he's becoming a more honest man, Moist must put all his con-man skills to use in a war between the clacks and post office -- or he'll lose a lot more than just his job.

""Going Postal"" a grittier, less fantastical story than the previous two Discworld miniseries. Sure, we still have fantasy stuff like banshees, golems, whispering letters and wizardly devices, but it all basically boils down to the Post Office against the telegraphesque clacks. But don't worry, the adaptation is pitch-perfect.

As with the original novel, the miniseries is a witty little affair with lots of funny moments, but it also has some darker moments (Moist being forced to see sepia-toned flashbacks of his crimes' fallouts -- suicide, bankruptcy, etc). The writers give it the usual Pratchett mix: dry, satirical wit (""How dare the Gods work against me! I don't remember giving them permission""), a striking central message, and a clever complicated plot.

Coyle really does a brilliant job as Moist, he's a charming rogue who starts out bratty and selfish, but becomes a kinder, better person as the story goes on... without losing his roguish charm. David Suchet plays Gilt with lip-curling relish, and there are some great smaller roles for Andrew Sachs, Nicholas Farrell, and the coldly Machievellian Charles Dance.

The one problem is Claire Foy. I don't know what it is about this actress, but her Adora is so relentlessly prickly and snarly that it's hard to see why Moist likes her.

It's hard to think of a communication service that makes the postal service look efficient, but ""Going Postal"" gives you a new appreciation for the written word. Another Pratchettian delight.",1309219200,52,2846,4.939330543933054
4588115,5,B0056G1AM0,"This was actually my introduction to British satirist Terry Pratchett, and what an introduction it was! If you have never discovered his hilarious Discworld, this film is a good place to start. You might just wind up like me in running to the library and the bookstore for more!

""Going Postal"" is about a con man who is offered a second chance by the Patrician of the city after being hanged (yes, you read that right -- he was already hanged once!): he can either leave free and unchallenged (unfortunately, the only door out of the room opens into a bottomless chasm) or he can revive the derelict Post Office, because the Patrician is sick of his long-distance games of Thud (like chess) being interrupted by his telegrams getting stuck in the Clacks. Moist chooses, as most of us might, this second option only to find himself in way over his head with whispering letters, a haunting past, a parole officer who lacks a sense of humor (and has an uncanny ability to always find him), two oddball assistants one of which who collects pins, and the realization that every one of his predecessors has died a horrible death. And then there's the woman he thinks he might grow to love if she'd stop trying to kill him. Not to mention murder, mayhem, assassins, thugs, thieves, and a competition that might end, as the story begins, with certain, sudden, and rather horrid death.

If you like quirky stories you're bound to like this one -- it has a dark, morbid sense of humor that kicks in right around the opening credits and doesn't let up until the end. The costuming and set design is spot on, as is the casting. Claire Foy is perfection as the sardonic, chain-smoking Miss Dearheart, David Suchet makes a marvelous villain who is at times rather humbled by his relative shortness, Richard Coyle makes a likable Moist, and I have never enjoyed Charles Dance more as the stony-faced Patrician who enjoys manipulating people to his own ends. While I have enjoyed the the other two films (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogfather/dp/B0010X741Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogfather</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Color-of-Magic/dp/B002436WFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Color of Magic</a>"" -- ""Hogfather"" in particular) I think this is the best in terms of providing sheer entertainment. It's funny, it's insane, and it's just the sort of thing kids might enjoy as well. (Although some of the jokes will go over their heads; there is some mild language and implied violence.)

Some changes are made to the story but not as many as in the last film. I think if you are already a Pratchett fan, you will be very pleased -- and if you're not, if you're anything like me, after seeing this you will be.",1308960000,108,2794,5.082788671023965

4588157,2,B0056G1AM0,"A few years ago my wife and I were introduced to Terry Pratchett's discworld via the audiobook version of Going Postal.  The wit and humor were just fantastic and we were instantly hooked.

We'd only read/listened to a few other discworld books when we found out Going Postal was on Netflix, but given how funny and entertaining all of those books were, we had high hopes for the live adaptation.  Our hopes were too high however.  The show grossly lacks most of Pratchett's original humor, and early on while watching part 1 we got so bored that I started to get drowsy.

The show is too long to watch in one sitting, so we stopped then came back a few days later to finish, but discovered that Netflix had discountinued it.  I was disappointed about not being able to finish, but oddly enough I was also a bit relieved about not having to sit through another hour or two of the boring, unfunny version of a normally very funny story.

The failure of the live-action Going Postal could be summed up by saying it's like the film makers decided to make a very seriously dramatic film and excised most of the humor to keep it serious.",1470873600,,1132,4.466019417475728
4588158,5,B0056G1AM0,Great movie. Glad to see another Terry Pratchett novel made into a film. There need to be more. It was bittersweet getting to watch him comment on the film since his passing.

4588163,3,B0056G1AM0,"""Going Postal"" was the last of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books which I really enjoyed thoroughly, and ranks probably in my top three or four of the series overall (after ""Thief of Time"", ""Night Watch"", and possibly ""Pyramids"").  That might incline me to be severe on an adaptation which doesn't live up to the book.  Certainly there are enough reasons for criticism.  One expects the plot of a movie to depart somewhat from the source material, but many of the changes here seem ill advised, as other reviewers have pointed out.  For me, the worst change was the penalty that Moist von Lipwig would have to pay (in the movie) if he lost that final bet.  Claire Foy had the spirit of Adora Belle just about right, but there was too much fiddling with the development of her relationship with Moist.  And it was sad to see the politically correct modern view of smoking affect the portrayal of her one vice.

And on and on.  See some of the other reviews for point by point criticisms.  And yet, it's an undeniable fact that the movie drew me in, and I watched all three hours in the same day.  The actors were mostly quite good, the set and costume design gave quite a good feel of being in Ankh-Morpork, and on the whole it was a well paced story that managed to be reasonably entertaining throughout.  If I had never read a Discworld book at all, I might have given it four stars (I almost never give five).  And as a fan, it was nice to see Terry Pratchett in a little walk on role.  In the end, it was not so much the changes from the book that dragged it down, as it was my opinion that many of those changes didn't make sense.  Still, I was not sorry to have given it a chance.  And by the way, watch the end credits for the second episode all the way to the end.",1466121600,4,1770,4.289156626506024

All of the underlying satire and social commentary... gone.  Three Quarters of the plot and supporting characters... gone.  And the remaining one fourth of the plot rewritten to the point where it is unrecognizable as the same story.

4588253,5,B0056G1AM0,"A while back, I fell in love with Terry Pratchett's writing.  I just didn't know it yet.  I had read 'Good Omens' that he coauthored with Neil Gaimen.  It wasn't until recently that I began reading his books, starting with 'Going Postal'.  The book was absolutely delicious!  I devoured it.  I love the characters that Pratchett wrote about and how each had their own distinct personality and will about them.  Moist was a conman that you couldn't help but love as he razzles and dazzles his way in to your heart by making promises too large to keep, yet, somehow, he finds a way to do the impossible on a weekly basis.  And yet, towards the end of the book, one can't help but notice that while Moist lives for the adrenaline of being a charlatan, he honestly beings to do things to be the better man.  I love Vetinari, the Tyrant who seems to know all and see all, but most of all, knows when to turn his back.  Vetinari never takes any sides but his own- and he'll make damn sure that his side is always the side that wins.

There are just so many characters in Pratchett's discworld.  All of them have their own story, and all of them are very unique, and unlike a lot of writers out there, Pratchett has taken the time to give them each their own personality and time in the lime light.  And the more I read his books, the more I love this movie.

This movie is about the details.  Whenever the reporter goes to Moist when she is trying to get her front page story, there is a vampire with her, that though no real mention was made of him in 'Going Postal', he is described in detail in Pratchett's book, 'Thud!'.  I love that Sargent Angua, the werewolf, is shown and mentioned in the movie, even though Moist doesn't realize that she is the werewolf until 'Making Money.'.  I love that Terry Pratchett cameos as a postman and reports to duty to Moist in the movie.  I love who they cast to play each roll, they were brilliant and portrayed the characters perfectly.

Now does this movie follow the book 100%?  No.  Does it even follow it 75%?  Ehhh...close.  But does it make readers of the book mad?  Not this one.  The way how they made the movie was done in a way that the story told- while based on the book- was indeed different but in no way was it worse than the story.  Stanly and his pin obsession?  Nailed i... Pinned it down.  Stanly doesn't do nails.  Mr Groat?  He's there and is as enthusiastic for promotions as ever.  No exploding underpants or natural remedies, though they did try to fit it into a scene that got cut.  The way how they depicted the letters talking to Moist was bloody brilliant.

And that was the thing with this movie.  It is simply brilliant.  It made the world of Moist and the story of 'Going Postal' come to life.  It's a long movie, sure.  It doesn't follow the book 100%, so what?  What really caught my eye about this movie and what made me buy it in the end was the high markings and reviews this had received.  Even people who had not read the book loved the movie!  And those that had loved it too!  To me that speaks volumes about how good the movie is.  Let me tell you something from my own personal experience- when a book lover can love a movie based off of a book that deviates from the storyline and still love the ending and have that warm fuzzy feeling when the credits roll and are silent because they don't want to state/argue about 'That's not what happened in the book!', that is a rare thing.  It's even more rare when that book lover is hoping that they make the sequel to the book, 'Making Money' in to a movie too and do it exactly how they did this one.  That is how good this movie is.  It had me laughing from the very beginning and left me happy and satisfied at the end.

So should you buy it?  Do you love a story where life and death hangs in the balance in a battle of wits, bold faced lies, and cunning?  A story that exposes the weaknesses and flaws of the majority and uses it to it's advantage while having fun with it?  How about where you root for the convict to win because he is the lesser of two evils in this three sided battle (the third side is guaranteed victory no matter what, much like the vultures that watch the duels in the desert.)?  If you said yes, then buy this movie.  Trust me, you won't regret it.",1401235200,,4301,4.2481481481481485

4588267,5,B0056G1AM0,"I love Discworld; Pratchett has taken a very clever idea and spun it into an amazing world.

Going Postal introduces the idea of Ankh-Morpork Post Office.  It turns out that the clacks system (basically semaphore towers that can send messages long distances using a Morse-code like system; these existed for a time in Europe) has become untrusthworthy and ""big for its britches"", and Lord Vetinari (who rules Ankh-Morpork) wants to see a competitor.  To this end he decides to revive the defunct Ankh-Morpork Post Office, and elects to put a con artist in charge of the whole thing.

Along the way we find out about what's REALLY going on with the clacks, meet some first-generation hackers, save the Golems, spawn a new collecting hobby, and find True Love.  Oh, and we work on getting that whole Post Office thing going.

Massively funny with some of the very best characterizations in any of the movies yet.  HIGHLY recommended if you love Discworld and/or funny fantasy movies (or maybe have a thing about stamps)",1387843200,,1017,4.877906976744186

Funny, poignant and just plain wonderful, Pratchett is the only author I know who created a world of his own but keeps slipping in 20th century elements that make you laugh out loud as you read and make your sides hurt because you laugh so much.  Pratchett's movies do the same thing.  The title of this movie/book - Going Postal - is just such an element.  In our lives, going postal meant going crazy and shooting up your workplace, your co-workers and anyone else who happened to get in the way!  In Pratchett's hands, going postal becomes a tool to insinuate modern mail delivery into a feudal world called Ankh Morpork.  Beautifully produced and acted by an all star cast including David Suchet, this movie is one I have and will watch over and over again - if only to see Ms. Adorabelle Dearhart use her stilletto heel in most unusual ways!",1380758400,,959,4.508670520231214

The characters of Moist, Vetinari and others are brought to life so realistically. They did an amazing job on special effects without needing a big budget or gratuitous CG, which certainly gave the golems more presence than they would have had otherwise.

These movies always go to show that you don't need to be Hollywood to make fantastic films. Any Discworld fan really needs to watch this, and as always, Sir Pratchett has a small cameo so that's a real treat.",1379376000,2,765,4.666666666666667

So, Ankh-Morpork has no dwarfs or trolls in this story. You don't see nary a one trundling by. In fact the only non humans you see are the golems.

I tell a lie. You get to see a poorly realized banshee (and a less-believable creature I have not seen outside of an episode of Doctor Who in a year of budget restrictions), and you get to see Otto Chriek, except you don't really, because he takes flash photographs without so much as a murmer of protest. Luckily, they don't affect him at all - so why bother making him a vampire at all in a production where money was obviously shaved off wherever possible? The whole point is lost.

And you get to see Angua in all her glory, far too much and far too long. You are in no doubt, nor is anyone else, who the Watch's werewolf is within ten minutes of the show starting.

Nobody smokes except for the love interest Dearheart, and she only does it as an indicator as to how far she has fallen and to enable a heavy-handed anti-tobacco message to be delivered (almost everyone interesting on the Disc smokes, and usually the most disreputable roll-your-owns into the bargain). I gave up smoking years ago but even I felt this was going far too far. PC has no place on the disc, surely?

Most grievously, the reason for the post office's demise is not even referred to, and we get no glimpse of BS Johnson's wonderful sorter.

Close on its heels we don't get to see the marvelous ride to Genua (Uberwald in the movie) on the magic-assisted cart.

In short, there was no reason to stick the label ""Discworld"" on this show at all, other than to fool people into buying it. Even reacher Gilt's parrot was excised in the interest of...f*ck knows.

The story is interesting in its own right, and is quite brilliantly told by a stellar cast, which is why it gets three stars. It is OK.

So many things were changed in this adaptations, the characters were so bland, so normal that it wasn't going postal anymore. Everything from the hanging to the first scene, to his lordship's talk with most feels rushed it ruins any wit that was left.

The werewolf is suppose to be a secret for a reason! Only William worde and moist in making money figure it out.

I could forgive the god awfull golems and banchee if they'd given him his gold suit when he was suppose to get it.

Adorablle wasn't severe enough she wasn't a challenge for moist and he liked her smoking it was strangely attractive for him. Part of her. "" I wondered if she could put the same passion into life as she did sucking down a cigarette"" Moist thought.

Moist is unlikeable, not very smart and he's while not on the lordships level never so shocked or stricken. Always appearing calm and in control.

Even if you changed things like when her brother died, or gilt they should have been more detailed and respectful to the characters. It's rubbish.

4588288,5,B0056G1AM0,"""Going Postal"" is a fantasy film that is based on the novel of the same name and written by Terry Pratchett. The movie centers around a shrewd but conniving conman named Moist Lipwig who does not realize how his actions affect other people until life circumstances force him to change.  Lipwig's conscience grows even more strongly when he meets and falls in love with Adora Belle Dearheart. Lipwig meets Adora Dearheart after he is given a mandatory assignment to work at the post office. Terry Pratchett plays a role in the film and the following actors/actresses are also featured in ""Going Postal"": Richard Coyle, David Suchet, Charles Dance,Claire Foy, Nicholas Farrell, Marnix, Broeke,Jimmy Yuill,Steve Pemberton, Andrew Sachs, Tamsin Greig, Ingrid Berdal, Adrian Schiller, Ian Bonar, Madhav Sharma, and Timothy West. The only caveat that was pointed out to me had to do with character personalities featured in the film compared to what was in the book. For instance,my husband watched the film with me out of curiosity and because he read the ""Going Postal"" book.  He explained to me that the characters of Adora and Lipwig were actually portrayed much more self-confidently in the book than the film.  Aside from that caveat, ""Going Postal"" is a quirky and adventurous film.",1373760000,,1283,5.1

4588292,4,B0056G1AM0,"I have read some of Terry Pratchet books and have now watched three of the movie adaptations:  ""Hogfather,"" ""The Color of Magic"" and ""Going Postal.""  I have not read any of these particular books, so I cannot comment on how faithfully they have adapted the movies from the books.  What I do know is that even if they scrupulously transcribed the plot and the characters, some of his sparkling wit and rapier-sharp satire which makes the books I have read so enjoyable seems to be lost in translation in every movie that I have watched.  And I think it is because of this loss that the pacing of all the movies seems much slower and weightier than the book.

This is probably the best adaptation, only because the pacing is much faster than in any of the other movies I have watched, which still puts it at an andante pace.  It also almost matched ""The Color of Magic"" movie in that great deadpan humor of Terry Pratchett's characters.

However, if you want to laugh until your stomach aches, my bet is on the book, which I plan to read in the very near future.",1371945600,2,1060,4.43298969072165
4588293,2,B0056G1AM0,"The TV version is what happens when you strip of Terry Pratchett's trademark wit from his work, leaving the little more than plot events. And then it twists those plot events into a banal morality play with a love story tacked on. The show did a nice job with the surfaces, providing a true-to-Discworld version of the city of Ankh-Morpork and its denizens. But beneath the surface, nothing.

It's understandable that the book's many characters would have to be pared down to a representative few. But give we fans a break with the plot! Gone was Pratchett's anti-corporate message. In was a Scrooge-like change of heart subplot that took over the film and made Moist von Lipwig shed his conniving ways (which Discworld readers know is nonsense). Gone is much of the suspense of the novel. As when Moist forges his way into bad-guy Reacher Gilt's table at a swanky restaurant. In the book, you knew Reacher was coming at any moment. In the film, it's just an unhappy coincidence that he shows up. And providing narration for half the film was silly, and a missed opportunity to include Pratchett's writing voice.

Terry Pratchett's work is more than the sum of its plot points. This ""Going Postal"" hit its visual marks well, but missed the wit and soul of the original.",1371340800,6,1269,4.737556561085973

You haven't read the book? You get a decent comedy with many funny quips and oneliners. There is some fantasy (fantastic creatures like werewolf, banshee and golems) and some magic, but most of the plot revolves around humans and their emotions: love, hate, greed, vengeance. The story is about the Post Office of Ankh Morpork. People have forgotten about Post Office in times of ""Clacks"" (something like telegraphy).

One of the least expensive but most entertaining is the series of movies based on the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett.  The latest one is Going Postal, which revolves around a con man using his skills  to redeem himself as a postmaster arrayed against the evil machinations of a purveyor of a new technology.  Filmed as a mini-series of two parts, this show has an entirely new cast of actors and actresses than the prior two Discworld movies; Hogsfather and The Colour of Magic.  However, they perform their parts just as well, putting forth a show that is part drama, part comedy, part suspense, and all irony.  The dialogue is sometimes deft, sometimes bombastic, and often insightful.  The characters are memorable, each with their own quirks and blend of stereotypes.

This is apparently the first Pratchett to be filmed by this studio, and they have done it their way.  The costumes are sort of Victorian with changes.  Many of the extras are actual fans, they sent a casting call to the English Pratchett fan club.

The Color of Money was entertaining but ultimately they didn't have the budget to pull off the book.  Going Postal however, is pretty true to the book and the acting is first rate.

4588335,4,B0056G1AM0,"You can read the super long reviews below for more detail but in my opinion, this adaptation of a Terry Pratchett book is the only one that has worked so far (except the BBC Radio plays Mort, Small Gods and Night Watch, which were all fantastic. The other radio plays were not). I was flinching waiting for this to come out because I disliked both Hogfather and Colour of Magic intensely. They were true to the details of the books, more or less, but utterly failed to capture any whiff of the humor, whimsy or sarcasm that makes Pratchett's work work.
So--Going Postal, while not perfect and not exactly the book, is a very serviceable version of the story. The acting is very good, though some borders on caricature, and the liberties taken to make a long book into a short movie generally don't rub too much against the run of the story. The essence remains intact and it's a fun view with far fewer in-jokes than the other films so newcomers have a hope in hell of understanding what's going on. Vetinari here is brilliant despite the reviewers who couldn't stand to have him not physically resemble the character in the book. That seems to be the main complaint: things weren't identical to the book in every way. Umm. Never gonna happen in any adaptation. The nitpicks I'm reading here below are mostly that: generally unreasonable expectations of a production to duplicate what they see in their head when they read a book. Having said all that, I had a few tiny complaints about this one but overall I loved it and feel like it's the first video adaptation to even come close.

Anyone who has read the wonderful fantasy novels that are the Discworld series knows that each page is funny, witty and the characters are fully developed.  Of course, to put ALL that into a movie is not possible with any great novel. But Sky1 took the plot, the characters, the premise and the humor and turned out a marvelous film.  Some things had to be changed to fit in the allotted time, but all novel-based movies must do that.

In the case of Terry Pratchett's Going Postal, it seems to be a good 60% of the humor.  Likewise, They do quite a bit to damage the continuity of any potential sequel in regards to Sgt. Angua (who never appeared as such in Going Postal, but was a nice addition nonetheless.).  Losing much of the wit and charm of the novel, and adding several sequences that more or less grind salt in the wounds, the movie adaptation comes across as a far harsher story than it need be.

Still, overall production is rather nice, visually appealing, and well acted.  I'd love to see this cast return for a hopefully closer adaptation of the equally witty Making Money.",1334707200,2,753,4.467153284671533
4588340,5,B0056G1AM0,"If anyone has read my previous reviews on this board, it is rather obvious that I am usually not drawn to this type of film preferring small independent foreign-language films instead.  However, after obtaining the knowledge that some of my favorite actors (i.e., Charles Dance, David Suchet--giving fabulous performances in this film) appeared in ""Going Postal"", I had to see it.

The movie ""Going Postal"" is so well directed, written (based on Terry Pratchett's book by the samename of which I had previously not known) and, most appealing to me, acted.  I simply adored Charles Dance (appeared in ""Bleak House)as Lord Vetinari  a very suave, frosty leader of the fantasy Victorian-like city of Ankh-Marpark where the action of this  film takes place sentencing the ""hero"" of the story,  Moist von Lipwig to die or take-over the ""out of date"" and falling apart post office.  The character of the con-man but brilliant Lipwig is wonderfully acted by Richard Coyle--he marvelously escapes some really ""close calls"" including two hangings.  I also adored David Suchet (of Parrot fame) that portrays Gilt the owner of the new technology called ""Clacks"" replacing hand written letters.  My god he is nasty having issues regarding his height and not being above committing murders to see that the ""new technology"" of the ""Clacks"" is the only one that is used to communicate with inspite of its flaws and ""breakdowns"".

I really, really enjoyed this movie with its ""over the top"" wizardry, explosions and ""special effects"".  I especially loved seeing Andrew Sachs (was Manuel in the series ""Faulty Towers) as a very dedicated postal worker.",1331856000,,1635,5.109022556390977

4588343,5,B0056G1AM0,"The props, sets, costumes and CGI of a 19th century land in the midst of technological revolution were just other-timely.  Well done crew. The banshee, and especially the golems with their clay like bodies, fiery eyes, mannerisms and voicing, were amongst the most uniquely created creatures of any movie I've seen including the Potter, Rings, Narnia movies. Underlying themes parallel contemporary 21st century business, technology and communication concerns e.g. the postal service in a bankrupt state and the reliability and issues with hacking, security of the internet and technology in general. Finally, there's woven through out a parody of capitalistic greed with it's human cost; especially as we experienced a few years back. All are mirrored in Going Postal.

Great dialogue such as the Stamps Postmaster trying to appease/divert the menacing banshee Gryle: ""Why not write to your granny?"" Banshee Gryle: ""I ate my granny."" Postmaster: ""Oh, an aunt then?"" Then there's Mr. Gilt (character names were entertaining in themselves) to Mr. Horsefry (his financial advisor): ""My latest innovation? This is about dazzling the masses with a bauble. I believe the respectable term is marketing."" Mr. Horsefry: ""The aim of business?"" Mr. Gilt: Not to provide a good service but to provide the only service."" His way of saying, control the market and you control the pricing, therefore the profits.

Great wit, moralism, humor, fantasy. Great cast and especially how naturalistically they interacted. If haven't seen already then ""Hogfather"" is recommended.",1329955200,2,1557,5.452282157676349
4588344,3,B0056G1AM0,"If you're looking for a live-action adaptation of Terry Pratchett's ""Going Postal"" which is faithful to the source material in every important respect - and only somewhat abridged - this is not it.  Think of this Sky production as ""based on the overall plot of Terry Pratchett's book of the same name"", and you're a lot closer.  Yes, it has Moist von Lipwig getting handed the choice of resurrecting the Ankh-Morpork Post Office or taking the final plunge, and yes, it has the evil Reacher Gilt (played brilliantly by David Suchet, who chews the scenery with vigor), and yes, it has Adora Belle Dearheart (minus her nickname) played most effectively by Claire Foy... but the characterization rendered for Moist by Richard Coyle leaves a great deal to be desired.  Additionally, fairly large and important plot lines are missing, along with a number of minor but entertaining side bits that would have added a lot to preserving the Prachettian discworldishness.  High points:  The noteworthy performances mentioned above, plus that of Marnix Van Den Broeke and Nicholas Farrell as (respectively) the body and voice of Pump 19.  Low points:  As already noted, the rewriting of Moist von Lipwig as a relatively nasty piece of work who is at best superficially similar to the books' version.

4588346,5,B0056G1AM0,"Those who haven't discovered Terry Pratchett's brilliantly funny novels have a treat in store. Most of them are set in an alternate universe, upon a flat world that travels through space on the shoulders of four elephants that stand on the shell of the great Atuin, a huge turtle. Despite the fact that the Discworld is so fundamentally different from our own and his characters so fantastic, you will see yourselves, the conventions and concerns of your own world, reflected in surprising, hysterically funny, and entirely entertaining ways.

Going Postal is the story of a con man who, when his cons catch up to him, is faced with the choice of re-opening the derelict post office or dying a painful death. As he reluctantly takes up his post he is faced with the unintended consequences of his crimes and soon finds himself, with his engagingly unbalanced staff, committed to saving the post office, bringing  Reacher Gilt, evil owner of the clacks system (rather like the internet without electricity) to justice, and winning the heart of Adora Bell Dearheart. The film brings the story to life as I would not have believed possible! Every character is perfectly recognizable; the set IS Ankh-Morpork!

I don't know how they managed it, but Mob Film Company and Sky1 made magic, and I would be ever so grateful if they would just keep going.

4588349,3,B0056G1AM0,"Terry Pratchett's books are that rare thing, books that can be read again and again with enjoyment.  While most books become predictable after reading them once or twice, a Discworld novel is full of satire big and small and a joy in words that trancends the plot.  Going Postal is once of my favorites.  Unfortunately the movie/miniseries has not been well translated from the book.  While the book works on many levels, plot, characters, humour, satire, word play, the movie concentrates mostly with plot and character, and fails there somewhat too.
Lacking the depth of the book it is only a reasonably good story about some mediocre people.  I agree with other posters when they say the characters weren't quite right.  Visually Spike was well represented -  but where was the prickly, dangerous woman we have come to know and love. Moist was inadequate as a showman and as a villan. In the book I felt that his change was driven by the discovery that he enjoyed the danger and challenge in his new life combined with a dawning realisation of the consequences of his actions, whereas in the movie it just seemed to happen for no real reason - even though the whole regret thing was laboured.  Also I hate the Golems, while they do look like some of the illustrations on the book covers, they lacked the sense of age, size and pottery-ness conveyed in the book. In fact they were rather cartoon-like.
It is a hard ask for a director to deliver on all these levels. But for extraodinary books, extraordinary films are expected.",1325635200,5,1529,4.700374531835206
4588350,5,B0056G1AM0,"Others have outlined the plot of this film, from a 2-part UK miniseries adapted from one of Terry Pratchett's best Discworld novels. So I won't. After watching the not bad but not especially good cartoon adaptations of a couple of PTerry's less important Discworld tales and being warned by friends not to spend money on the live films taken from ""Hogfather"" and ""The Color of Magic/The Light Fantastic""--which I wouldn't have anyhow since I don't consider any of these worthy of the author's finest achievements--I was delightedly shocked that this film was SUPERB! Yes, the book was beautifully crafted, witty, science-fictionally clever and deeply ethical, and the film fulfilled every aspect. Sorry it didn't include some of the good stuff from the novel, but, heck, it's only a little more than 3 hours long, not exactly Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace""!

I never saw a more well-casted film. Richard Coyle and Claire Foy were perfect, and had a curious, if chaste, chemistry. (Curious if you know the story.) Ian Bonar, with that ultra-expressive, not quite homely face, just about stole the show, and I could forgive David Suchet for teetering on the edge of overacting, considering how much his hidden monster resembled Bernie Madoff, our Earthworld incarnation of Reacher Gilt, under an affable exterior, like con man Moist von Lipwig before his moral rehab. Great to see Sir Terry in the film, too, in a bit part. It must have been filmed not long before his confinement to a wheelchair. But he's proved in his latest novel, ""Snuff"", that he hasn't lost his touch. The clacks scenes were so authentic I began to wonder why, since the old-time Persians and Romans used semaphore stations, neither of those intellectually rich empires ever got around to inventing it.

Now to await more Discworld novels on live film, starting with, I hope, a really great adaptation of ""Guards! Guards!"" the first of the Ankh-Morpork Watch stories. (It's no secret that Sam Vimes is most readers' favorite persona, certainly mine.) Then move on to the Witches novels starting with the first appearance of Granny Weatherwax in ""Equal Rites"" (what happened to co-ed Unseen U afterward?) The better Death novels might do better as good Pixar-type cartoons, although one of my top favorites, ""Reaper Man"", and perhaps others would transfer well to live film. I hope to see the Sweeper stories filmed, especially ""Thief of Time"", plus Moist's second adventure, ""Making Money"" and a prequel to both, ""The Truth""--with the same wonderful actress playing Sacharissa. Let the ""Going Postal"" directing, casting, set design, costuming & FX team make them.

I had such hopes for this movie, but they were dashed and a small piece of my soul died when I watched this movie.  The actors that were cast wonderfully chosen and awesome.

4588356,2,B0056G1AM0,"I waited for this to come out in the US, checking futilely at the SkyOne site every few weeks from its air date. The trailer looked great, the casting looked superb, and we had such high hopes for it. Of course, it took bloody well forever to come out in the US, but when I finally saw it pop up on Amazon (having done my monthly or so check and contemplating buying a region free DVD player if it didn't finally finally come out in region 1) I immediately snaffled it.

And then my husband and I sat down to watch it.

What was so promising sadly petered out into a whiffle of something pretending to be a Pratchett adaptation. Where to start? Let's start with Moist von Lipwig, conman extraordinaire. Richard Coyle is adequate, but we could never decide if he just didn't have a handle on the character or if he was playing him according to the director's whims. Moist should be a showman at all times, always confident, always upstaging Reacher Gilt, always keeping Adora Belle Dearheart on her toes. Richard Coyle's Moist goes for redemption too early and too often and plays Moist as a fairly jittery and easily upstaged postmaster. With the exception of the prayer to Offler scene, Moist is upstaged in every confrontation with Reacher or Adora Belle. Not enough showman here to satisfy, and his redemption is too pat.

Then there is Claire Foy's Adora Belle. Casting here is spot on but the material takes Adora Belle to very un-Adora Belle places. Where is the Spike we come to know and love? And seriously, what was up with the lack of smoking? Look, I'm as much for the Clean Air Act as the next non-smoker (my lungs, they like the clean air) but I still love the serious anti-heroine spin Pratchett gave Adora Belle/Spike. She cries and falls apart over the news of her brother--something she'd long come to grips with in the book--and rabble-rouses the golems in petty ways. I blame the material because it's obvious that Claire Foy could make a first rate spike. But she frickin' gives up smoking at the end of the movie???? (One of my favourite lines in Postal's sequel is Moist thinking about his future children in their well-ventilated nursery. My husband and I both had the impression that Adora Belle came out of the womb with a cigarette in hand. Neither of us is smokers, but we resent tampering with our beloved Spike in order to sanitise the movie.)

Reacher Gilt is not as smart or as subtle as he is in the book. Seriously overplayed by a scenery chewing David Suchet. He tips his hand too early, he takes Moist's showmanship vibes with his Clacks Mobile Marketing, and he doesn't come across as competent enough to have stolen the Clacks in the first place.

The story line is severely tampered with. The credits say Pratchett mucked around with it, but the story doesn't feel like a worthy adaptation of the book. The sorting machine is left out, Adora Belle's knowledge is undercut to the character's detriment, there are weird side interludes that didn't happen inserted into the story line, the clever subversions of the book are undercut with cinematic tropes that feel shopworn. I understand that a certain amount of abridgement goes on to adapt a book to a screenplay, but the whole thing feels weirdly ""Hollywoodised"" or whatever the British equivilant would be. I know that not everything can make it into a movie, but when key favourite scenes from the book are missing while flat-feeling set pieces take their place, I am made sad. The pacing felt very erratic, particularly when Moist is being confronted with the voices of the letters.

(List of things I missed: 1) Stanley whacking Gryll in the mouth with a bag of pins 2) The only god Moist prays to is Offler? Heretics! Anoia is mightily displeased. 3) The Senior Postsmans Secret Society and their hazing of Moist 4) Moist basically being a proper showman and always being one step ahead of Reacher Gilt. 5) Drumknott's pencils. 6) The sorting machine death of Gryll. 7) The ever-present ring of smoke following Adora Belle and Moist finding her lodgings by asking cigarette sellers. 8) Moist nicknaming Adora Belle ""Spike"". 9) Boris! Practically neutered. Pratchett's cranky animals are the best, and Boris reigns above the likes of Rogers the Bulls and You Bastard the Camel, so making him unexpectedly docile sucked. 10) If you show Angua, I'd appreciate seeing Carrot and Nobby too, but that's just me wishing.)

There are some lovely gems buried in this sad adaptation. Andrew Sachs as Groat (despite a lack of cough syrup vapor) is wonderful, although outdone by Ian Bonar as the perfect Stanley. Stanley really is one of the better preserved characters in this adaptation and his pin-fanaticism nicely captured. Dave the Pin Dealer is a nice bit part for Paul Barber, and Tamsin Grieg as a slightly older Sacharissa made me wish they were adapting The Truth. Charles Dance is nearly perfect as one of my favouritest character, Vetinari. He only cracks a little once, smiling near the end--one of those cinematic tells I wish they wouldn't do to characters. (I wish directors would trust the audiences to get that instead of going for the obvious.) Aside from that, his deadpan delivery was a thing of beauty. Ingrid Berdal is only briefly utilised as Angua but is very effective. And I have to say I loved spotting the fellow playing Otto Chriek, the vampire photographer, in the crowds. Mr. Pump worked well, and I was pleased that his speech to Moist about killing people in increments made it into the movie, as it's one of the best bits in the book. Casting was well done for the most part--I only feel that the main characters were ill-served by the pointless script changes.

In the end, I was a bit bummed out. All that wait, and the fabulosity promised by the trailer and the book itself failed to materialise. I'm a huge Pratchett fangirl and just didn't feel that this adaptation lived up to expectations. Hogfather worked, so I know that Jean Vadim's team CAN do a decent Pratchett adaptation. (We still watch that one at Christmastime.) But this one fizzled rather than sizzled. Moist was disappointing, Adora/Spike was tampered with to make her character more palatable, and the changes to the story line weakened the presentation as a whole.

On the whole, a disappointment. I'll stick with the book, which is fantastic, and in my top five for Discworld. (1. Hogfather 2. Jingo 3. Going Postal 4. The Truth 5. Night Watch with honorable mentions going to the first three Guards books, Reaper Man, Thief of Time, and Small Gods, because it's just that hard for a girl to choose from so much excellence.)",1322870400,41,6616,4.726169844020797
4588357,5,B0056G1AM0,"I absolutely loved this!  I've seen it four times, now.  The chemistry between Adora and Lipwig is outstanding.  The production company and the director did a fantastic job translating the book for movie purposes.  I know others have complained about Angua, but let's cut some slack.  How else were they going to explain what she was and how they tracked him down?  Movies don't have the luxury of hundreds of words to explain a single point.  Even the book only touches on it, not even saying anything ""out loud"", relying on you to have read others in the series to fully understand.  I empathize that they got her completely wrong but she's a very small part in the movie.  Which was fantastic!  I loved the golems and the clacks!  Just how I pictured them.  I would have loved to see the 19,000 year old golem in there, but alas!  Not every character can get a spotlight.

If you love Pratchett, you should love this movie!",1322870400,,926,4.533333333333333
4588358,5,B0056G1AM0,"I've watched the other two films (Color of Magic and Hogfather) and found them to be mediocre to OK. (They always got great actors, but for some reason the films didn't flow well.) My expectations weren't really high for this film based on my past experiences. Imagine my surprise to discover this is a very well done min-series! To me, Going Postal sets the bar for how good future Discworld movies should be. Everything, from the actors, scripting, to the set design was just really really well done. I enjoyed every minute!

My husband, who's never touched the books, enjoyed this movie (mini-series?) and actually laughed at the funny parts! He actually paid attention through the whole thing and said he liked it when it was done. That's pretty high praise for a guy who's never read the books.

Any Discworld fans who complains about the movie ""not being like the book"" should be ashamed of themselves. Terry Pratchett himself said he liked the film and even played a bit part in it. If the actual author is OK with the changes made from book-to-film, I think the fans ought to be too. :P

My surprise favorite? Charles Dance as Lord Vetinari! He wasn't what I expecting, in appearance, but in voice and how he carries himself he is perfect. The voice I had in my head for Lord Vetinari and how Charles Dance played him are almost exactly the same. I hope they bring him back in the future to play this role, because I can't imagine anyone doing such a good job.

I wonder if they'll do Making Money? I'm stuck because I really really want to see a movie based on the City Watch (who else was thrilled to see Angua?) but I'd also love to see the cast from Going Postal to come back and do a second film. Either way, if they keep this level of production for any future films, I'll definitely buy them! :)",1322784000,,1810,4.459214501510574
4588359,5,B0056G1AM0,"Ankh-Morpork, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere... One of the tricks to ruling the perverse city of Ankh-Morpork is to persistently arrive at unconventional solutions. Also, be more straight-up scary than any other of its citizens. The Patrician, the intimidating and insidiously sneaky Lord Vetinari, is Ankh-Morpork's top official, and he's maintained his benign tyranny by always staying a few moves ahead of everyone else. He's proven to be unoustable. In the Discworld's sprawling capital city, where social upheavals and faddish folderols erupt with the frequency of a clacks transmission, the Patrician abides as its sublimely steadying force.

It's the clacks, by the way, which has been giving the Patrician some grief. The operation of the clacks - a series of visual telegraph towers that span pretty much the breadth of Discworld nowadays - has been taken over by the Grand Trunk Company, of which its unscrupulous and eye-patched leading figure, Reacher Gilt (a properly sinister David Suchet), doesn't shy from underhanded means to ensure profit for business. He, in fact, regularly contracts a banshee assassin to do away with those who get in his way. Lord Vetinari notes the clacks' worsening brand of service and, conversely, the escalating costs for the customers. He suspects Reacher Gilt's abominable nature. He sets a thief to catch a thief.

GOING POSTAL, Terry Pratchett's 33rd Discworld novel, is also the British Sky network's third screen adaptation and easily the most accessible of the three. It features one of my favorite characters in the crafty confidence man, Moist von Lipwig (Richard Coyle). But von Lipwig isn't so crafty that he avoids being caught (although it's no shame to be sniffed out by a werewolf sergeant of the City Watch). At the Patrician's whim, von Lipwig is hanged literally within ""an inch of his life,"" after which he is extended a curious offer: final irrevocable death... or assuming the position of Ankh-Morpork's Postmaster General. And, really, what sort of choices are those? As head of the post office, he gets to wear a funny hat. With wings on.

It's a daunting undertaking, reviving the dormant post office, a creepy crawly place in which every corner presents heaps and piles and stacks of dusty undelivered mail. Having fallen into obscurity and sparsely staffed (by misfits), the post office has given way to the speedier and more modern clacks system (which also happens to be the Discworld's answer to the Internet). For Moist von Lipwig, it's about calculating his odds of successfully getting the ef out of dodge versus sticking it out to turn a fast buck. He experiments with flight but is rapidly retrieved by his assigned protector and parole officer, Mr. Pump #19. Mr. Pump is a golem, persistent, relentless, doesn't require breaks.

Several factors combine to convince von Lipwig to stick it out, despite his learning that the previous four postmasters did perish under horrific circumstances. There's the Patrician's impressive brand of intimidation, and Mr. Pump's presence and wide-eyed philosophy. There is Reacher Gilt's meddling (Gilt is not about to allow the post office to succeed). There's the mystical guilt trip as laid on him by the letters themselves; these missives cry out to be delivered. And then there is icy Adora Belle Dearheart (Clair Foy), manager of the Golem Trust and daughter of the inventor of the clacks. Adora Dearheart, who smokes like chimney stacks, but is nonetheless entirely delightful. The reluctant postmaster is smitten and he stays. And, by staying, he achieves a measure of grace.

Maybe it's because I prefer the book, GOING POSTAL, over HOGFATHER and THE COLOR OF MAGIC, but I absolutely loved this two-part mini-series. The acting is across the board superb. The production values are marvelous and eye-catching. Fans of Mr. Pratchett ought to frolic over the film's little touches, those neat Easter eggs. There is even a Terry Pratchett sighting, as the man himself shows up for a cameo near the end. Mostly, for me, it's about the central character. Richard Coyle has splendidly fleshed out Moist von Lipwig, making him into a very likable, everyman type of rogue.

Ever the showman, Moist von Lipwig applies his immense ability to bamboozle his marks. Thru verbal bells and whistles and grandstanding methods, he sways the doubting public into patronizing the post office. In search of the fast buck, he invents the postage stamp and the Discworld's own version of the Pony Express. And as the post office flourishes, Reacher Gilt reaches ever deeper into his bag of dirty tricks. It's pretty inevitable that a rivalry would surface between the post and the clacks, and that the written press would take note. There's a sense of gratification, by the way, in observing Otto in the trenches. If you recall, in the novel THE TRUTH, Otto is the vampire photographer who disintegrates each time he uses his flash camera. See? Easter egg.

The heated rivalry culminates in a 1700 mile overnight race which pits a postal horse carriage versus the clacks' semaphore towers to see which of these establishments can first deliver a message. Yeah, it smacks a bit of John Henry versus the steam-powered hammer. The odds weigh heavy against von Lipwig and his post office, but the dude is undaunted. Still, it's this sort of windmill tilting that inspires the Patrician to make pithy observations. ""Well, you've made quite a splash,"" remarks the Patrician at one point to von Lidwig, ""as the fish said to the man with the lead weight tied to his feet."" As Lord Vetinari, I think I actually prefer Charles Dance to Jeremy Irons (THE COLOR OF MAGIC). Dance seems more imposing and even more quietly menacing.

GOING POSTAL is wholeheartedly recommended. It moves fast. The characters capture your attention. You'll root for the underdog hero, and laugh at his shenanigans. You may even cross your fingers for him to win over the gothic and severe Adora Dearheart, but that's an uphill battle. I knew I was in good hands from jump, from the opening credits which showcase the inner workings of the clacks. The clacks system is rendered convincingly, with its shutters and signal lights and ticker tapes. It actually seems to be something that would function in real life.  This screen adaptation isn't quite faithful to the original source. Stuff's been added, omitted, changed in order. But the alterations do work within the constraints of the film's running time. If you've only ever seen the film but haven't read the book (and shame on you), then you may be compelled to pick up the book. Because as good as this mini-series is, the book is even better. GOING POSTAL, a film that clearly demonstrates the superiority of stamp collecting over pin collecting. Pin collecting is just silly.

GOING POSTAL comes in two discs. Disc 1 presents the movie along with Terry Pratchett's 5-minute video introduction and the option for director Jon Jones' audio commentary. Disc 2 offers 6 deleted scenes, image galleries (story boards, must-see props & posters, set drawings), a gag reel, and over 51 minutes of interviews with the film's cast and crew, as well as with Terry Pratchett.",1322265600,6,7209,5.02510460251046

4588363,5,B0056G1AM0,"While there will always be nit-picking to be done when a book as complex and wonderful as Going Postal becomes a movie, this film is still wonderful. The visual interpretation of the clacks, it's mechanisms, and it's workers is dead on.
The only real problem I had with it was the character of Reacher Gilt was oversimplified and kind of dumbed-down compared to the character in the book.",1319500800,,388,4.720588235294118
4588364,5,B0056G1AM0,"You can watch this movie as Pratchett's commentary on criminal capitalism, ala Enron. Or you can watch it as a caper movie, featuring two, perhaps three con men. But however you watch it, this movie will please, delight and amuse you. This is one of Terry Pratchett's best novels, and it has been adapted brilliantly. The Mob and Vadim Jean ""get"" Terry Pratchett. With each adaptation, The Mob gets closer to a perfect Pratchett.

The pseudonymous Alfred Spangler is dead, hung by the neck to dance the rope fandango. But a very surprised Moist van Lipwig awakes in the Patrician's office. When offered the choice of becoming Postmaster of the dead-as-a-dinosaur Ankh-Morpork postal service or the right to leave the Patrician's office by the door behind him, the bright young con man accepts the duties of Postmaster. When running away doesn't work - he has a seriously diligent parole officer - Moist settles in to the challenge. To his surprise, running a big operation like the Post Office is a lot like running a con; to his greater surprise, he even starts to enjoy it.

But the competition to the Postal Service - the Grand Trunk Clacks, a kind of Middle Ages internet - is run by Reacher Gilt, a one-eyed, black-haired chairman. Gilt takes competition to new extremes. Moist, who has always disdained violence, and Gilt, who will stop at nothing, engage in an escalating struggle. Moist can't seem to help himself, his reaction to a challenge is to up the stakes. And in a game of Find the Lady, no one is better than Moist.

As a caper story, the setup is perfect. Pratchett shows you all the cups, and defies you to find the pea. It makes the ending immensely satisfying. As an indictment of the immorality of capitalism, the part that works best is your laughter. Nothing that takes itself so seriously, and is so self-important, can stand ridicule. Including Reacher Gilt.

As in all Pratchett stories, there are very funny scenes, but the mature Pratchett uses humor for a purpose beyond entertainment. The cast is very good, and Richard Coyle as the partially reformed con man is especially good. The movie captures the essence of the story without too much sacrifice of the careful detail Pratchett brings to his stories. About the only character that I really missed was Reacher Gilts's parrot screaming, ""Twelve and a half percent.""

I worry, though that the denouement - the reveal - is done too quickly for folks not familiar with the book to understand what Moist Von Lipwig does, the essence of the con.

But that's a minor nit. The movie captures very well the heart of what a Discworld novel is all about. Pratchett uses the Discworld as a mirror to reveal the parts of our world we otherwise cannot or will not see. This is a fine adaptation, nearly flawless, and a delight from beginning to end.

4588378,5,B0056G1AM0,"I have been a fan of Terry Pratchett's writing for far too long and I admire the manner in which he can take reality that one step into fantasy, at the same time making it hilariously funny and making a satirical comment about much that is happening in our lives. His Discworld characters may be fiction, but all too often they are acting out fantasies so close to the realities of present day life it is almost excruciating. This film adaptation of his book is brilliant.

As with all his ""Watch"" and ""City"" stories, this is as much a social commentary as it is a comedy. Look closely and you recognise the bureaucrats, the ""trolls"" we live with and even the ""golems"" among us. As for the rapacious owner of the ""Clacks"" - we see them at work in every corporate boardroom, fortunately, most not quite as rapaciously though. The hero of the story is a conman to his fingertips, perhaps far more the conman than even he realises, yet his ""schemes"" provide insights into the origins of ""paper money"" and even ""postage stamps.""

Pratchett is a keen observer of the world around him and has the wonderful knack of being able to hold up a mirror to our own world to create the fantasy and make us laugh. THis joins, in my opinion, the best of the best as a social commentary, readable, enjoyable, comic and yet carrying a serious message as well. As a movie, it is terrific with every actor bringing something to the realism of the characters. Suchet as the villain and the Patrician in particular are brilliant!

Personally I think I could live with a Patrician like Vetinari running things ... In fact, sometimes I wonder whether he isn't perhaps already doing so.

4588379,5,B0056G1AM0,"LOL QUIRKINESS. A Medieval fantasy in an English Victorian setting with modern phraseology. Stunning sets and costuming to match any computer generated animation's fun. ""GOING POSTAL"" was filmed in Budapest with a stunning star-studded cast. Rightly so, for such a production of one of Terry Pratchett's amazing Discworld books. And disclosed in the ample bonus material: the author loves this film with 2 feature-length episodes.
SUBTITLES.

Main plot is a con-man (Richard Coyle-Lorna Doone) is saved from the gallows by being forced to become Postmaster at defunct Ankh-Morport PO. A super-con's worst nightmare. His name, Moist Von Lipwig, is as weird as his official cap. Businessman Gilt (David Suchet-Poirot) is amazing, the villain, devilish and funny, and now owns the Clacks. Clacks are a communication system (typewriter, semaphore, tickertape, and network of strings.) Moist lives in the PO and has ghost visits not unlike Dicken's Victorian Ebenezer. Moist's haunting past. Author Pratchett even goes postal with a Postman cameo requiring 6 takes.

Beyond that info, just be open minded (or no mind) and enjoy an experience worthy of 6 stars. It's an unadulterated mix of adventure, comedy, action, fantasy, historical drama, romance, magic, and it's addicting. Rich characters, common trait from this world-renown author, that live in a fantasy world eons beyond the Land of OZ. So fantastical! And magical stars: Lord Vetinari (Charles Dance- Bleak House; Gosford Park); Ridcully (Timothy West-Colditz; Bleak House) a wizard; Old Postman Groat (Andrew Sachs); Mr Pony (John Henshaw-South Riding); Mr. Pump voice (Nicholas Farrell) a golem (orange Vader, Hulk type).

Romance is added to the plot with former Clacks heir, Adora (Claire Foy-Little Dorrit; Upstairs Downstairs) but done call her Adorable or she'll kill you. She was swindled by...guess who. Romance will be tough for Moist, cause Adora is one harsh gal. This Postal tribute has to be seen to be believed, travesty of sanity, and just FUN. Some little tykes may be frightened by some scenes, but it is youth-older viewing delight. Move over Harry Potter.
