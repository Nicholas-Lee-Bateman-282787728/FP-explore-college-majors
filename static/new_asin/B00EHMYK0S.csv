5914920,4,B00EHMYK0S,"Porque el amor manda (Love Rules - 901 minutes)

Once again, our dependable Fernando Colunga (""Alborada"") turns in an admirable job as our hero, while I was pleasantly surprised by Blanca Soto. I don't remember seeing her before and she has a sweet, lovely face.

Jess Garcia (Colunga) is tricked into crossing the border lugging a suitcase with cash hidden in it, so when he is arrested, he spends the next four discs on parole. He had just been told he had a baby daughter born right after his girlfriend dumped him six years earlier which had prompted him to go to the United States. Now he's coming back to Mexico to meet his daughter.

That faithless girlfriend, Vernica, played by Claudia lvarez, proves to be difficult at best and stark staring nuts at her worst. She has married a wonderful guy, Elias, played by Jorge Aravena, who adores his adopted daughter. Eventually the two fathers team up to provide the best situation for their much-adored little girl.

In the meantime, our gorgeous heroine Alma, is engaged to a fellow we know right away is a creep although it takes her three discs to figure it out. Our hero must have a job, so he gets a job as a secretary at her company, which generates a LOT of teasing and bullying by his other bosses and co-workers.

By the third disc, the story starts to disintegrate, with some over-the-top comedy and overacting. Villains are too villainous and some of the story is waaay too contrived. Of course it's a telenovela, so I guess that's to be expected.

I very much like the two leads. Some of the editing is choppy, but the telenovela is edited down from 182 episodes, so that isn't a surprise. I own this one because of Colunga. You will appreciate how he becomes a nervous blabbermouth when he is ill at ease. Very unlike other characters he has played.

The four-disc set arrived via Amazon in perfect condition. The English captions are just fine.",1395014400,4,1911,4.619469026548672
