8376934,5,B002PE942O,"the posted reviews for Lou Reed on stage-1980 were NOT helpful because they were written about a different DVD by a different artist. This is actually footage from Don Kirshner's rock concert from 04-19-80. I saw the show a number of times. Songs are largely from ""Growing Up in Public"" and ""Street Hassle"". While the songs are few in number (Lou was not the only artist that night), the performance and the reasonable price for the DVD, make this a must buy for any real Reed fan.",1472256000,,481,4.540229885057471
