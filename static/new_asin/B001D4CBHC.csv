8632637,1,B001D4CBHC,"I bought this video a few years ago. The video I received has a different cover than the video advertised showing the mountain blowing up and the helicopter. The difference? The video with the drawing of the mountain blowing its top and the helicopter is the original release and has the unedited soundtrack. It's not available anymore. If you order this video, you'll get the one with Art Carney on the cover and a garbled and edited soundtrack.",1334534400,,446,4.730769230769231
