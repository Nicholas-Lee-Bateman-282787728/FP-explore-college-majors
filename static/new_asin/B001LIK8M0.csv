3683543,3,B001LIK8M0,"This is another unfortunate example of better-than-average horror films being shunted off a theatrical release schedule, while we have to suffer through other films of a lesser quality. Amusement, while it was indeed sparingly advertised as a horror film, can be viewed more as a thriller than anything else. Presented as three connected shorts before merging into one story in the last act, the film tells the tale of a deeply disturbed villain unleashing a well-planned act of vengeance against three young women from his past.

The film is fun and has some surprisingly clever moments, but at the same time it does ask the viewer to put a lot of thought into the motivations of the villain. This is something that isn't common in slasher films (which Amusement does turn into towards the end, at least to a point), and as such unless you're prepared to wax philosophical after the credits finish rolling this may not be the right movie for you.

Aside from its quirks Amusement sports solid acting from most of its cast, in particular Kier O'Donnell who provides a chilling villain in The Laugh. One of the film's weakest points, however, happens to be what little gore is used in the film. For a movie that prides itself on atmosphere and set-pieces, the completely CGI gore scenes are jarring and quite honestly detract from the movie. Things would've been smoother had they taken the time to use old-school makeup effects to bring the violence to life.

Overall, despite the disjointed plot and over-reliance on CGI to provide the movie's scarce visceral shocks, Amusement stands as fun way to spend 85 min.",1232496000,6,1613,4.858181818181818

3683547,3,B001LIK8M0,"If I were basing this review solely on the second segment, it would get 5 stars. That part of the movie is absolutely terrifying (especially if you don't like clowns, like me). For the most part, movies don't really scare me, but in this case, I almost had to turn the movie off; that's never happened before. But the other segments bring the rating down. The first part is suspenseful enough and had a twist, but the third segment is pretty stupid, and the final sequence involving all three girls falls short. One thing I didn't like about this movie is that the first and third stories focus too much on the main girls' boyfriends. This movie is supposed to be about three female friends facing horrifying things, but only the second segment of the three separate stories focuses on the girl exclusively. So this definitely could have been better, but it's worth watching for the second segment alone, trust me.",1468713600,2,914,4.683229813664596

3683555,3,B001LIK8M0,"I'm perplexed by this one.  Not sure if I find it interesting or if I feel like I'm seeing the same old thing all over again.
That being said, what this flick ends up being is a cross/blend of many typical horror scenarios, but it mixes up
several, and blends them well enough for a movie that wasn't intended to win the Oscar night.
There are touches of everything:  The Saw movies, every cabin in the woods movie, the obvious poor choices by
the show off lead, but it also ties different stories together in the end.
Oh yeah, and clowns.  :  )
My creepy clown collection is more fun than the one they have in one of these vignettes, but the big guy who is shown
on the cover of the disc makes their collection better.  The female lead looks like she could have been Scarlett Johansson's little sister.
I'd like to see a lot more of her, but since this movie is 8 years old, and I haven't heard of her, that may not happen.
""Katheryn Winnick is a Canadian actress. She is best known for her roles in Amusement, Bones, A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, Vikings, and The Art of the Steal.""

3683572,1,B001LIK8M0,"What a mess.

This movie was boring, predictable, and poorly written. Even after saying that I haven't touched on the biggest problem with the film -- it made absolutely no sense. I'll expand on that later. First let me point out the other flaws.

The movie is divided into three separate stories, each one accomplishing the impressive feat of being worse than the last. These three stories ""converge"" at the end for a final section that is so bad and nonsensical that I can only hope it's some type of avant-garde joke. Each story is basically its own cliched horror film: a killer is loose on the highway; a killer terrorizes the babysitter; a killer has a girl trapped inside an old building.

All of these stories are infuriating, mostly because the victims are unfathomably retarded. At one point, the babysitter escapes the house into the front yard. She decides that the best thing to do is hide in the tool shed. Guess how that turns out. The girl in the third story suspects her friend is being held captive inside an old building. She sends her boyfriend in to investigate. Hours later, when he doesn't come back, she decides to sneak in by herself. Guess how that turns out. Later in the film, one of the characters manages to stab the killer in the neck. He falls to the floor, and of course the girls all run away to try to find a way to escape. Guess how that turns out. Honestly, how many times do we have to see these tired scenes play out with their complete predictability and impossibly stupid characters? It's just lazy writing, totally unbelievable, and makes me immediately lose all interest in whether or not the characters survive.

Anyway, let's assume that you're an idiot and this all sounds appealing to you because you like horror movies. I STILL say to steer clear of this one. Why? Because it makes absolutely zero sense. Just trust me, it doesn't. Yes, I paid attention. Yes, I understood the connection between the three stories. The movie does not make a lick of sense. I don't know how to explain why without giving away plot details, so let's just say that I will be very impressed if anyone can answer a single one of these questions (spoilers below):

1. If the guy in the back of the convoy was the killer, who was the girl in the semi-driver's truck, why did she look scared, and why did the semi-driver lie about being alone?

2. How could the girl's body smash into the main character's windshield when the killer was driving behind them?

3. Why did the semi-driver try to run over the boyfriend?

4. Why is the killer in the first story a different person than in the third and fourth? I could be wrong on this one, maybe it's the same guy with a different hairstyle, but as best as I can tell these are completely different actors. In any case it's extremely confusing.

5. How did the psychologist woman come to be at the abandoned house/tunnel without realizing that it wasn't a real police station and that no one else was around? If the killer had previously been a patient of hers, how could he trick her into thinking he was an FBI agent? This part made no sense at all.

I could go on and on, but it's pointless because there are no answers. Whoever wrote this didn't put an ounce of thought into it. Horrible.",1322438400,4,3262,4.504230118443316
3683573,5,B001LIK8M0,Great movie for the price u can't beat it plus I got it quick it took about 3 days not bad the movie is an underated horror movie with a lot of twists I really enjoyed it.,1322179200,,171,3.6486486486486487

3683575,3,B001LIK8M0,"I liked the flick. I wouldn't recommend it to many people though, just the people like me who would be interested in seeing it. It's a pretty decent horror film. It's not as bad as many would have you believe, but I'm also not the hardest person to entertain. I let movies do exactly that...entertain me. And this movie did that. It's a pretty decent movie for only three bucks! I can dig that haha If I had to go back in time and have the option to buy this film again, I totally would. It's worth the price.

The production value was surprisingly higher than I expected from a three dollar movie. So the movie is nice to look at. I really enjoyed the plot and twists that this movie had. Although the movie isn't realistic in what the killer can actually do, it's pretty enjoyable to watch. And really, who watches movies for realism? Go get a documentary for that.",1310774400,2,867,4.351851851851852
3683576,3,B001LIK8M0,This movie was actually pretty good. The first 2/3 of the movie was entertaining and kept me guessing. The last third was predictable and didn't really use two of the three main characters as much as they could have. Overall the movie was pretty good and the acting was pretty good. One of the villains was hilarious and did a great job. If you can pick up this movie cheap its worth the watch.,1307491200,2,394,4.337837837837838
3683577,5,B001LIK8M0,This movie was very short unfortunately but was very suspenseful and scary. Would recommend to anyone that can keep up with stop and not get destracted because you will get very confused if you don't pay attention because it changes scenes a few times.,1305936000,,252,4.75
3683578,4,B001LIK8M0,"I don't get all the negative reviews -- this movie actually has a lot going for it.  And personally, I've always liked this kind of tripartite structure, whether the three separate stories interconnect at the end (as is the case with this film), or connect only through an actor or general theme (as with my favorite, 1955's excellent ""Three Cases of Murder"").  I was entertained by ""Amusement:"" it is not just a flick to help waste your time, and the folks involved in its making clearly wanted to make a good movie, despite the budget.

As mentioned, ""Amusement"" consists of three stories with somewhat open endings, all three of which are resolved in a common dnouement at the end.  Other than the first story, which I felt was the weakest of the bunch, ""Amusement"" is mostly carried by the main actor, Katheryn Winnick.  Despite her demure clothing throughout, Winnick is decidedly more Playboy-bunny (well, a very athletic bunny -- she is after all a Taekwondo champion) than ordinary-girl-next-door, and at first I thought she was slightly mis-cast.  I was wrong -- not only does she give a truly solid performance (notably better than the norm in these sorts of roles), her inherent sexuality seemed to enhance the sense of a strong, tough woman who will survive no matter what.  Winnick is much more than eye candy here; she actually carries the film.

The sets deserve a special mention -- they are above the norm.  The pacing, and focus on telling a coherent story (really hard, I would think, in a movie structured like this) are also above-average.",1305072000,8,1560,4.812734082397004

Part three: LISA takes us to an ancient, labyrinthine hotel where all of the pieces come together for the horrific finale. Though the killer's motivation may seem ridiculous, it does illustrate just how our actions can come back to bite us. I enjoyed this one mostly due to its pace and overarching sense of doom.

3683580,3,B001LIK8M0,"3 stars because it had potential and because I paid less than $5 for it, so I can't complain too much about wasting money.  Since my interest in film and other visual media is academic as well as (dare I say?) amusement, I'm glad I have the film in my collection.  There are interesting elements, such as the 70's horror style beginning with the travellers on the road.  The clown thing was no surprise, but excellent pacing of the scene put me on edge.  The moment of connection between victim and psycho was good.

Unfortunately, the film was not very amusing or frightening.  Too much of what was happening was either obvious, disjointed, or just not very entertaining.  A few changes in how things were revealed or hidden and a couple different twists would have made the movie excellent.  I have to admit, the one big twist during the revelation of all three victims together was quite a novel one, but then the next scenes seemed weak.  This movie could have been great.  Instead, it barely rose to mediocre.",1299110400,4,1014,4.614525139664805
3683581,4,B001LIK8M0,"As I love horror movies I give them their own rating stars a normal critic might give this one two stars because of it's budget and disjointedness. Which works here except for the ending perhaps. This killer reminded me of a young dr. giggles and mad serial killer and yes such giggling madmen do exist, my friend worked in a lunatic asylum and supersmart giggling killers were not safe to be around alone to say the least.  The blu ray looks great here with no extras to be had but the picture is great. We know who the killer is and why he is doing what he is doing but this flick has the feel of a first time director in some ways, that being said it's still miles above many d level horror flicks I have seen, it's slick and well shot. The acting is done by a better group than a c or d movie like lets say 'demonic'. This movie does have a trule inspired clown scene too ,just like the cover. However this isn't a house of traps movie, it does have them to be sure but they are not picking off characters like in ""SAW"".  I have to give this movie kudos for having a young killer played by a talented actor who pulls it off nicely. He's creepy and weird and yet believable, the rest of cast isn't well developed but then in these movies  people get chased around and there's little time for a backstory usually.  The ending was a little disjointed as a character escapes the mansion and ends up out in the country in another house. You just have to suspend your disbelief I guess and take it for granted that the two places are connected underground but that would a very long tunnel system! This fact didn't detour me from enjoying this little horror film at least it's professionally done on good film stock and not video tape like we had alot of back in the 80's. This film is in more horror collection and it's not a bad movie, a nonhorror fan may give this over the top in some cases movie one star for things like dissapearing characters but that's ok , we know he killed them off even though it didn't show what happened to them. The Shelby characters boyfriend and another female prisoner are captured but their fates are not shown. Still we know they are dead other movies would have shown the audience this fact though.

3683583,4,B001LIK8M0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this creepy, unpredictable and seriously underrated horror movie. I can't understand how any true horror fan couldn't like what is on display here. It keeps up a decent pace without the obligatory 20 minute character intros we often have to suffer through, instead treating us to dark and eerie scenes dripping with atmosphere and dread that rarely let up. In fact it's hard to know who the main character is until half way through the movie because it's so unpredictable and major characters drop like flies when you least expect it.

There are some EXCELLENT twists and there is a nail-biting scene of torment with these two tied up girls at the end that culminates in a stunning finale! My only gripe with it would be that I wish the killer had kept their clown mask on toward the end instead of showing their real face so much during the final scene. Other than that, if you're a fan of atmosphere, suspense and some decent but quick scenes of blood & gore then you should be quite 'amused' by this interesting and fast paced horror flick.

dons makeup to fool his victims. No suspense, nothing
that can match other horror movies.

The plot drags on and on like a long-winded afternoon soap opera.

3683586,2,B001LIK8M0,"For the past few trips to Blockbuster Video, I've walked through the ""horror"" section and have seen the movie Amusement sitting on the shelf. It looks creepy...It has a scary clown on the cover, it's in the HORROR section, and the cover entices you with the line ""Your Fear. His Amusement"". The cover alone made me pick up the case a few times, and even after reading the summary on the back, the movie looks like it would be a thriller.

Amusement is a horrible movie.

The plot of the movie is quite simple, and should have worked out decently. You meet one of the three girls in the story; Tabitha (Katheryn Winnick), Shelby (Laura Breckenridge), and Lisa (Jessica Lewis), and you follow them for a short period of time, witnessing what we'll call ""the worst day of their life"". Each girl's story is presented separately, and then all tied together a little later in the film. The gist of the story is that when the three girls were in elementary school, there was a boy in their class who made a disturbing diorama of a gutted squirrel, and they decided to tell the teacher about it. The boy was committed to a mental hospital, and when he grew up, he decided that it was time for revenge on the girls who had him sent away.

So great, you read the plot, and think ""Yeah, this has potential...the killer would have a good reason for revenge, I can see how separately the girls ""bad day"" stories tie into this big story..."". The first half of the movie is even pretty neat with some of the other gore that happens...but then we get to the half way point of the film. Everything starts to tie together in the movie, and it seems like there a lead-up to the ending starting to be formed, and then BAM! The movie comes to a dead stop. Once Tabitha realizes what's going on, it seems like the writers just said ""Well now what do we do"", and just slapped some lines together to finish out the movie. This is extremely poor form, and ruined what could have at least been a barely decent film.

As something billed as a horror movie, especially a movie that's come out in the past few years I would have at least expected one of two things coming into the film that have become ""standards"" of horror: (semi) nudity or lots of gore. The ""violent"" scenes are extremely bland, and don't really show anything, and there's no eye candy either. Usually, from what I've seen, if a movie is known as a throw-away movie, there's usually at least something extremely gross to look at, or some semi-naked females here and there. This movie fails on both fronts, but in a film full of fail, I wouldn't have expected anything else from them.

The ONLY redeeming part of the movie is the killer. The Laugh (that's right, The Laugh) does exactly what it sounds like...he laughs. The girls run into him, he does something serial killer-esque, and he just starts laughing in this creepy but hilarious laugh.",1279670400,2,2886,4.479087452471483

There are some ""holes"" in the plot, and overall the plot is jumbled.  Bouncing from sub-plot to sub-plot was confusing, and made the movie seem pieced together.

Not a great flick, but if you have a chance, it's worth a watch.",1276473600,,395,4.585714285714285
3683588,3,B001LIK8M0,"Many reviewers here are missing one important point about Amusement: reminiscent atmosphere. The opening sequence screams of creepiness a-la Joy Ride and of course, tries to manage a surprise twist on the idea. (Anyone who knows horror movies will see it coming.) The clown scene is actually better, with some suspense, false jumps and eerie camera angles, making the clown doll/costume appear even scarier than the movie's cover pic. Our laugher's lair is a blend of the house from Psycho and a run down version of the overlook hotel from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. That dining room with it's board room style table and antique chairs had me wondering when we were going to begin seeing the laugher having conversations with a long dead mother or hallucinating over prior years' guests and chopping down doors with fire axes(didn't happen, as earlier in the movie during the clown scene, he was tearing down a door in a slightly new way)The ending actually wasn't as bad as what other reviewers said either, with some decent suspense, but a surprisingly lacking end to our villain due to his forgetfulness to put away his toys. (and a damn nice toy, from the earlier clown scene)Now normally, if a movie exhibited such a low level of ability to tell a new story I would be giving it one or no stars, but in spite of the fact that the filmmakers chose not to give a lot of back story to our villain to better explain his motives as to why he chooses to emulate horror movie scenes in real life, this film does work to a degree. Whether the people involved with the production are horror fans who were paying homage to their favorite scenes or trying to fix things they saw wrong with other movies (who didn't want to see that truck driver from Joy Ride get his skull bashed in by the end of the first movie?) they managed to do all of the scenes in Amusement with a great deal of style and attention to detail, often lacking in horror movies with a low budget. It somehow manages not to stink of unoriginal theft. It's as if they know all of the elements that make up the scares of a good horror movie, but are lacking in the character development department. I couldn't help thinking of The Dentist and Dr. Giggles every time our nutcase laugher let loose, but how did he gain access to the lair and the knowledge to create such a dark, foreboding place? Even Dr Giggles had a bit more of a history than a guy in a surgeon's mask slicing people to ribbons with his scalpel. So now the real question arises, if they made another, would I see a sequel to Amusement? If I'm in the right frame of mind that night, I might.... it could be quite.... amusing. 3.25 stars",1272067200,,2668,4.503092783505155
3683589,4,B001LIK8M0,"Amusement is an imaginatively put-together movie - it starts off seeming like an anthology movie, only one whose portions are more like end-slices of full-length films rather than individual stories.  Then it starts drawing these pieces in together until you have the full story unfold.  It taps on elements familiar from such movies as Friday The 13th to House Of Wax to Trick R Treat to Saw, creating a whole that's very well-produced, original, sexy, and with genuine shock moments that don't telegraph themselves a mile away, or even an inch away.  Personally, I think a movie like this - where it's the intention that you don't figure out the actual connecting story until about half-way through - is best watched with as little foreknowledge as possible, and for anyone already considering getting this I'd advise you to stop reading and just go ahead and get it - if you're into horror, you won't likely be disappointed.

  However, most people are going to want a bit more to go on, so I'll elaborate a bit, first with my usual warning.

***WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*****

  The various seemingly unrelated segments are connected by a common past shared by at least one character in each segment - a past in which they each came into contact with a demented individual who's now tracking each of them down.  The killer likes to play games with his targets, but it's not just another variation on the widely influential Saw theme where the victims are trapped and challenged to survive tests.  In this case, it's elaborate scenarios that the targets don't even know Are set-ups orchestrated by the killer, often where the disguised killer himself is playing a role completely unbeknownest to any of the other people involved.  Often there's nothing at all to indicate that events are being manipulated.

  A couple of these sceanrios, admittedly, have flaws from a story stand-point.  Some are very believable, but at other times coincidence plays too large a role, and in at least one case it's difficult to see how the character in question could have walked into the circumstances without major alarm bells being set off.  So how much of a hinderance is it to the whole movie?  Not very much, really.  A little bit of retooling could have probably eliminated most of the problem; and if you want to think about it a bit it's not too hard to come up with a ""Well, maybe if..."" explanation as to how a seemingly nonfeasible situation could have actually  worked, perhaps with events that simply took place offscreen.  When you're this good, if your biggest fault is that it calls for a bit of conjecture on the part of the viewer to fit a couple of the pieces together, that's not too big a problem.  Ninety per cent of Amusement is very well crafted and thought out, only about ten per cent affected by some plot holes.

  As for what it's got right - original concept and (mostly) highly skillful execution, fine acting, good solid production values, freaky visual imagery, nice characteriztion, high-quality special effects, gorgeous female cast members, genuine suspense and a couple of real jolts.  What is there left to say?  Four-and-a-half stars.",1267401600,2,3175,4.851301115241636
3683590,4,B001LIK8M0,"Hmmm...I can easily see this little Horror flick being forgotten about over time as with so many other Horror gems that I've come to appreciate (some sooner than others), in time.  The reason I can see 'Amusement' forgotten about, is because this giggly, Dr. Giggles-sounding  villain is NOT so much iconic in the world of so many great Horror characters.  This killer is an average looking/size person.  Maybe that's why I like this.  Also, the way this story has been stitched together has been done before.  Plus, there is no mystery except for the question I have.  Well, You'll know who the killer is and you know mostly who his victims are.  This flick gives all of that information right up front.  The only mystery is that you don't know how this killer will achieve his ""amusing"" goals!  I do like the wicked little laugh coming from the killer.  It's true, you can either hate this laugh (which is heard throughout the feature), and let it ruin the whole flick, or you can enjoy it because it fits its title so perfectly.  I will have to agree with most of the critics on here about the clown scene!  Loved it!!!  There are quite a few scenes I loved.

 I do have a question on some of those locations that the killer manages to use for his sick game.  Were those locations inherited???  Was he from a rich family of entertainers???  He did say he came from a long history of performers and entertainers.  I just don't see how he managed to rig up some of those things.  This is mainly the second half of the film that I'm questioning.  All horrific locations, by the way.  Not big on gore but does have some blood here and there.  Speaking of gore, I was let down by one certain scene but then quickly reminded myself of the title.  All in all, I enjoyed this little Horror.",1266796800,,1785,4.435185185185185
3683591,2,B001LIK8M0,"Ever wonder what happened to that mentally disturbed little kid in your class?  Well he is probably plotting against you right now.  At least that is the story line for Amusement.  Three girls all connected by a childhood friendship, and a creepy little boy, are thrown together in this horror movie.

Something happened when they were kids, and now each girl is suffering a fate they determined for themselves a long time ago.  If you are really interested in seeing the movie, be assured that I will not spoil anything.  The opening credits let you know who these people are, and how they are connected.

So why only 2 stars?  Well, honestly it is a bad film.  It is a waste of time.  It is long (which is sad for like 87 minutes) and tedious.  The opening scene is too long and does not make any sense.  Where did all these people come from?  Why the obsession with convoys?  Why entwine other people without explanation?  The second segment gave this movie its 2 star rating.  While still poorly done, it was by far the best part (which is not saying much).  But clowns are always scary.  Although, this segment too left me with questions: how did he know she'd be there, etc, etc?  And the last segment was just unbelievable, over the top.  Why is it in horror movie world, no one calls the police?  Why is it even a disturbed psycho takes on immortality or invincibility?  The world may never know...

If you (1), take this to heart. I just got done watching this movie and it did absolutely nothing for me.
Amusement doesn't draw you in whatsoever. All the principles of a good movie are completely absent. There is no rise of action, no climax, it just simply keeps the same pace the whole movie. I can respect the attempted story line, as it does make an attempt at a thick plot, but it completely fails. The scenes don't seem to connect and it turns out to be really sloppy. This is honestly all i got from tihs movie: A weirdo from back in grade school seeks revenge (for whatever reason, motives are never revealed) This guy just dresses up as different people and puts on acts then, as you probably guessed, he reveals himself and laughs an obnoxious laugh. Seriously, he laughs this entire movie. This movie should be called ""Annoying Laughter"".
The best part of this movie is towards the end... While he is in the act, the main girl (I think) starts laughing, he is immediately touched by this laughter and frees her from her restraints and for a moment there is a romantic and touching connection between the two. Haha that was amusing. This is not a Clown killer movie by any means. Don't let the cover fool you.

It's about 3 childhood friends all being stalked by the same childhood psychopath.
A boy they rightfully mocked during a diorama contest,
because his diorama was seriously seriously sadistic!!
And so was his laugh.
This kid was ""The Joker"" in the making.
Don't want to ruin it for you like the description on the page, but his diorama will certainly offend some.
Years later they are all captured in 3 very different ways.
SOO different they feel like 3 different movies all together.
Like watching an anthology flick with Joyride, Dolls, & Hostel all in same movie.
The story jumps around a bit because of this,
which can get a bit confusing at times, but never enough that it gets annoying,
In the end all 3 tales are tied together.
There are some plot holes,
but the suspense & scares this movie manages to conjure more than make up for it.
I jumped when it wanted me to jump,
I cringed when it wanted me to cringe,
and I shivered when it wanted me to shiver.
I found that as far as horror goes,
this was a solid purchase,
it had every kind of scare on one disc.
Despite it's lack of gore it was downright incredible!!
but what little it did have... was still amazing!!
Like an old diamond this movie is flawed, but solid.

I really enjoyed this film, and the plot wasn't too bad either. The 'big chasing' wasn't as scary as I'd hoped but the clostrophobic and unsettling situations he puts his victims in was very nerve wrecking. I especially love the scene involving the room with clowns. When she tells the children's mother that the life size clown on the rocking chair freaks her out, the mother says, we don't have a lifesize clown...scary!

3683596,2,B001LIK8M0,"When a horror movie posts a creepy looking clown on the cover odds are I'm going to check it out. When looking at scary movies with clowns only Clownhouse, It, & Killer Klowns from Outer Space are real standouts for my taste. Despite that fact I still tend to check out all these weak clown horror attempts in hopes of finding a classic. Unfortunately in this case the clown on the cover was something to lure you in since it only played a role for about 10 minutes of the film. I've noticed this is a pretty common complaint about the film and overall will aid in more negative reviews.

The film turns out to consist of a few different poorly written stories all tying together at the end. The first story is about a girl Shelby & her boyfriend rob as they become part of a disastrous convey trip. The second is the best part of the film where the clown appears for the first and only time while a girl named Tabitha is babysitting. The third installment is a girl Lisa who goes home with a guy after a night at the bar to never come home again. Now all the girls in the stories wind up being linked through a ridiculous situation back in elementary school along with their killer.

It's pretty much a waste of an hour and a half with very few enjoyable parts. The killer himself is so pathetic there is no way you could find him scary. He has this annoying laugh he does through that becomes so annoying you want jump through the tv and strangle him. It wasn't all terrible though thanks to the girls in the story. All 3 actresses did a really solid job with Tabitha(Katheryn Winnick) leading the pack by being the most believable. The clown segment itself was pretty creepy and should have been the premise for the entire film. If they had focused primarily on the killer being dressed up as the clown the film would've had a better chance at success.",1246752000,28,1855,4.358381502890174
3683597,4,B001LIK8M0,"This film started off with a wholoe new approach I'd never seen before, and I liked it. It took the story of all three girls in depth, and the villan in the film made the tactics dreadful.

The highway scene with the character Shelby had a great twist-turn at the end when you find out about the trucker.

The house scene with Tabitha kept me at the edge of my seat- I absolutly hate - really hate! - clowns. You kind of knew what was going to happen with the clown dummy sitting in the rocker, but I could still imagine that happening to any new babysitter.

The sequence where it introduced Lisa seemed to take to long to get to the end and to the capture, but it was still creepy.

As for the end, I think that the writer could have made it more revealing about what actually happened to the little boy, but it seemed to be too sloppy.

Overall: the beginning was great, the middle was pretty good, and the end could've used some work.

I would still recommend",1244764800,,963,4.2349726775956285
3683598,3,B001LIK8M0,"When the cover of a horror film sports a very creepy clown you are always tempted to check it out. The idea of the murderous circus character draws any horror fan in no matter how bad it will most likely be. The first really great clown film (in our opinion) came out in 1989 called Clownhouse which was shortly followed by the far more popular film IT, spawning a new breed of horror appealing to all those freaked out by our face painted friends. Which brings us to our feature of the evening Amusement. The cover will be slightly misleading since it's not about a killer clown, just more of a deranged loser who happened to be Todd in Wedding Crashers.

The film was done a little different and broken up into three pieces centered around 3 girls Tabitha, Shelby, & Lisa. The first up is Shelby and her boyfriend Rob as they get involved in a convey trip that goes bad. The next is Tabitha who has the best part in the film. In her's she is babysitting her two nephews when she has to fight for her life against the clown on the cover. By far this as creepy as it gets. Third up is Lisa who leaves a bar with a guy and never returns forcing her friend to go searching for her. All these stories wind up coming together for the ending in which you find the girls all were close friends in elementary school. They all went their separate ways but are reunited one more time as they try to survive the evil Todd.

Overall this wasn't great but wasn't terrible either. The acting was actually great from the three girls, especially Tabitha. It really made the film much easier to enjoy despite the confusion and plot holes. There are some parts you will have abandon questions you have and just go with the flow. The killer really doesn't have a scary quality to him besides his annoying laugh. He doesn't draw you in making you feel a true sense of worry, nor is his motive for wanting to murder the girls anything special. With all that said Amusement would be worth checking out but not buying since you won't feel the need to watch it again.",1242604800,3,2044,4.348167539267016

AMUSEMENT starts off so bad it's good.
Example: A trucker has a female hostage in the back of his sleeper cab.  Driving down the highway she somehow leaps out and gets smashed on the windshield of the car behind them.  She survives, and the trucker is not even the bad guy of the story?  It makes no sense, but it's kinda cool.

AMUSEMENT becomes so bad it's bad.

The opening of the movie see's a couple on there way home driving down a highway in part of a convoy that turns bad... and then the opening credits roll and that last thing has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.

Then some families niece arrives at there place while the baby sitter has disappeared and she is to look after the kids.

The movie was too confusing, it had no real plot or meaning to anything... apparently it was supposed to be about 3 girls who teased a boy when they where kids, forgot him, but he didn't forget them for his weirdo revenge years later.

Gimmie a break here with the 3 star or higher ratings for this thing... it's only barely able to scrape an extra star out of me from a perfect 1.

On the one hand, Amusement has fantastic production values--it couldn't possibly look more slick or polished.  But Amusement has no plot or character development and I mean quite literally none.  It's just a bunch of suspense sequences one after another.  They are connected by the laughing psychopath killer and the fact that he went to grammar school with his intended victims fifteen years earlier.  That sentence pretty much represents the entire story Amusement manages to tell from beginning to end.  There are no twists.  The women he is targeting have no connection to each other after childhood.  The movie gives each of the three female victims a name which appears onscreen when we first see them as adults but none of the three has a personality, a job or seemingly any purpose in life whatsoever other than to be terrorized by a psycho from so far back in their lives that two of the three young women might not even realize who he is.  In the opening scene when the characters are all children they are showing each other dioramas that they made for a school art fair.  The boy's appears to show a rat that has been vivisected but is still alive--although it's actually a clever optical illusion.  He says it's funny, isn't it?  One of the little girls looks at it and says no, that's sick.  That exchange is apparently the entire motivation for the laughing psycho going after the girls fifteen years later.  Why did he wait so long?  Was he locked up in a mental institution?  Did he just recently escape or get released?  Amusement never bothers to say.  Didn't anybody notice that Amusement seems to have a first draft script written by a ten-year-old before the movie went into production?  Amusement barely even qualifies as a movie.  It feels like a bunch of ideas for suspense sequences that were filmed before anyone got around to coming up with a plot.  If you think the Friday the 13th films waste way too much time on the story, character development, and dialogue then Amusement might actually be the perfect horror movie for you.
