7841591,5,6303242103,"Ah what can I say, not only do you know Martin is funny but look at the credits, he is also executive producer. Timothy Mark, David Knoller and Michael Hubbard made a wise choice to producers for this. Director Thomas Schlamme also made a wise choice by being involved with this.

7841594,5,6303242103,"I saw this comedy show at the cinema in London a few years ago, and I have spoken of it ever since. I have been trying to find the video ever since for my private collection.  Martin's forte is stand up comedy.  Go Martin,  I'm about to order this video from Amazon, and can't wait to invite my  friends around to watch it with me.
If you want to laugh harder than you  ever have don't miss ""You so Crazy"".
Enjoy people",962496000,3,419,4.060975609756097
