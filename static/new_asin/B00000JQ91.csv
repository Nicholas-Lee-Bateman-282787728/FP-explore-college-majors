7913504,5,B00000JQ91,"I loved this program.  It had a lot of footage on polar bears.  It featured a mother bear teaching her cubs how to hunt and survive.  She taught them hunting techniques in games to make it fun.  Survival is not always easy.  A male bear must be avoided or the cubs will be killed so he can mate with the female.  I learned a lot about Polar Bears.
I was particularly interested to learn about the damage to their ecosystem.  I was unaware that the toxins dumped into our oceans is being absorbed by microorganisms.  These microorganisms are being eaten by krill.  The krill is eaten by cod.  The cod is in turn eaten by seals, which are eaten by polar bears.  At each step the toxins are accumulated in the fatty tissues of each animal and concentrated.  In the end, the toxins are passed on in the milk of the polar bear to the cubs.  It is yet another example of how we need to stop dumping toxins into the oceans.  We rely on the sea as well.
This would ge a great program for teachers to teach their students about how we can adversely impact our environment.  Another great program would be the National Geographic video ""Arctic Kingdom:  Life at the Edge"".  Another program is in the Nature Series and is called ""Toothwalkers:  Giants of the Arctic Ice""  All of these programs are wonderful.  Another program is available from the Nature Series and is called ""Great White Bear"", it has the same title as this video but is not the same program.  All have the same type of material in them.",989452800,4,1494,4.3992673992674
