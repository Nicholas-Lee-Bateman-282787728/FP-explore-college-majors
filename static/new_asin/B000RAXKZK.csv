8199883,5,B000RAXKZK,"Dead in 3 days is the American Title. It is one of the most beautifully shot slasher films I have seen, somewhat in the arena of ""Cold Prey"" but a much better film. The scenery and location is gorgeous as is everything else about the film. This of course is not why we watch slasher films but it was nice to watch one that was stylishly done with inventive and effective lighting techniques .
The story is original although there are those Cliches'we live for..Such as the victims calling for one another in the dark saying things like ""is That you"" ""OK this isn't funny anymore"" "" and such lines as ""you don't have to do this"" ""this place gives me the creeps"" and so forth..but it's a formula that has been used in the genre since day one and I personally wouldn't want it to change..
The effects were very realistic but not overdone ,there was enough gore to satisfy myself and I'm a gore hound. The character development was good as well as the acting. Water plays a big part in the film so it's everywhere and it does have a meaning to it as you will see near the end of the third act. There was a twist that was not so stunning but it was thrilling and I enjoyed the way the film ended as well.",1268006400,2,1199,4.217391304347826
