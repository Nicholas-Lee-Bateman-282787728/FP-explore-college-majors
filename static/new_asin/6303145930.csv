600743,1,6303145930,"Too many villains, too little plot. The Cybermen should've been the only villains and they should've been more formidable. Further, the plot was reminiscent of ""Remembrance Of The Daleks."" A complete waste of time all around.",989884800,4,225,5.277777777777778
600744,3,6303145930,"There seemed to be a trend in 'post-modern' stories during thelate eighties of Dr Who.  Whilst 'Trial of a Time Lord' and 'GreatestShow in the Galaxy' tried out this approach and were classics, the same cannot be said for the 'official silver anniversary story'.
'Silver Nemesis' takes the post-modern approach too far... The plot is a steal from the far superior 'Remembrance of the Daleks' (the Doctor tricks an old enemy into gaining control of a powerful weapon from Gallifrey's past which then destroys them).  It's all very muddled, with neo-Nazis, medieval time-travellers, living metal all thrown in.  Not to mention 'hints' that the Doctor is not who we thought he was, done with all the subtlety of cyanide mouthwash. Added to that is the fact that the idea of an asteroid circling the Earth once every 25 years simply doesn't work - the asteroid, being in a decaying orbit, would surely take less and less time to circle the Earth.  And the business involving Cybermen and gold is completely ridiculous.  Gold dust can clog up a Cyberman's breathing unit and suffocate it, yes, but how can gold-headed arrows penetrate a Cyberman's armour when machine-gun bullets fail to do so?  Gold is, as has been pointed out, a soft metal, something which was actually mentioned in an older Cyberman story.
True, 'Nemesis' is at least entertaining.  It all looks and sounds very nice with plenty of special effects, gripping action scenes, marvellous camerawork and a good soundtrack.  Just don't start to think about the plot.  And some of the 'missing scenes' should have stayed missing as, far from adding to the adventure's appeal, they positively detract from it.
The 'Making of Silver Nemesis' makes this video a worthwhile purchase if you want to get an idea about how a Dr Who story comes into being.",957657600,5,1807,4.898360655737705
600862,2,6303145930,"Silver Nemesis is a weird mix of Cybermen, Nazis , and magic. The plot is hard to follow and illogical with some bizarre occurrences such as the Doctor and Ace's trip t to Windsor Palace to get help with the Silver Nemesis from the military by speaking to the Queen. It suffer from poor acting and poor effect with many of the scale models looking particularly poor.

On the positive side, there are some good scenes with the Doctor and Ace just hanging out together that are enjoyable to watch. In addition. I also have to admit to liking the action scene in the third episode. The scene did make the Cybermen look pathetic but it was probably the best shot sequence of the story and Ace and her slingshot are fantastic. There's also some hints of the Doctor having a deeper and perhaps more darker plan as well as some secrets, which was intriguing. I also like a bit of the Jazz

Overall this is probably the worst Cybermen story of all time because it really undermines them as a threat. Beyond the Cybermen, the story is overwhelmed by far too many character for a three parter and poor handling of them.",1432080000,,1109,4.458128078817734

600869,5,6303145930,"I recently watched Silver Nemesis again and hadn't seen it in over 20 years but thoroughly enjoyed it. I've never seen the VHS copy so don't have any idea about what the other reviewer was talking about. If he still has the VHS then good for him. Oh, what's a VHS player again? Oh yeah that thing that eats tapes... that's right.
I have many a Doctor Who episode on VHS AND Beta but all gone now, the shows look fantastic on DVD and having just watched Silver Nemesis I applaud this story and its efforts and how well it succeeded in just being fun.
Going by my memories the only 7th Doctor stories I really enjoyed were Time and the Rani, Paradise Towers, Dragonfire, The Happiness Patrol and remembrance of the Daleks... but happily and thanks to my local library I get to rent and watch Classic Doctor Who for free before laying down the big bucks for each DVD and that allows me to decide which episodes to purchase first. As I am a DW completest I want them all of course. But as you have to be very careful with money these days I am going between ordering the most affordable and also the stories I am more likely to re-watch again.
I am happily adding both Silver Nemesis, The Greatest Show in the Galaxy and Ghost Light to my list of favorite 7th Doctor serials.
I think Silver is good fun, a fast paced story with different groups all competing for the same prize.
It's like the Da Vinci Code of Doctor Who. It really is.
You have Neo-Nazis who want to create a 4th Reich, the Cybermen - classic DW villain, Lady Peniforth and Richard and of course Ace and The Doctor all after the arrow and bow of Nemesis.
Not to mention you have a jazz band at a resort, a story that goes back and forth between the 1600's and 1988.
What more do you really want from Doctor Who? Seriously?
Any Doctor could have been in this story and it would have worked wonderfully, I could easily envision Matt Smith and Clara running from the Cybermen or David Tennant and Martha outwitting Lady Peniforth or the 9th Doctor and Rose going up against the Neo-Nazis.
Really, it's THAT good. This episode could have been made today and it would have held up and does hold up better than most stories from Series 6 of the new show anyway.
Many of the Sylvester McCoy stories are just as interesting and modern and unique as any the new show has to offer... so you could say that the 7th Doctor was ahead of his time....",1393977600,,2399,4.321507760532151

600871,4,6303145930,"This Seventh Doctor story represents the 25th anniversary episode of the show, and is it ever packed with interesting story elements! The Silver Nemesis represents a powerful Time Lord artifact that the Doctor needs to keep out of the hands of a number of bad guys, including the Cybermen, Nazis in exile trying to raise the Fourth Reich, a Sorceress from the Middle Ages and her henchman, and almost incidentally the civil authorities of the 1980's. There's a lot to both like and dislike about this story, There's some great characters, who are played by wonderful actors and actresses; Ace is at her usual best, blowing things up and fighting Cybermen; and the Doctor is getting his deeper darker backstory on as envisioned by the Cartmel Masterplan. I particularly liked the very Eighties touch of Ace's Boom-Box that the Doctor has re-engineered for her and now has many more features than just playing her favorite tunes. The outdoor settings are very nice, and are used for some excellent scenes.

On the downside, there are some annoying elements that just grated on me. The Silver Nemisis is poorly explained and used to execute a textbook deus ex machina outcome to the whole story. The Cybermen's weakness to gold is used in a way very unlike other stories. And the Sorceress apparently uses necromancy to time travel to the present without any pseudo-scientific explanation being present to justify her use of magic.

However, is spite of my nagging issues with the story, I do recommend it. It is a good example of the Seventh Doctor and Ace story, and the supporting characters in the story are absolutely wonderful.",1376179200,,1630,4.9021739130434785
600962,5,6303145930,"I have to admit, this was probably my least favorite of the episodes from season 25.  Don't get me wrong, it's still great, but this felt more like a 4.5 star story than a full 5 star one.  Although I thought the other 3 part stories I've seen were absolutely perfect, this could have honestly used one more episode, mainly for fleshing out the enemies.  While the Cybermen & Lady Peinforte were given the right amount of backstory, the Nazis felt a little, underdeveloped.  I mean, these things just don't come out of nowhere.  A little bit of history for them would have gone a long way.  But I had no complaints when I saw the awesome pawning of the Cybermen by Ace, the Doctor & Richard.  Great episode all in all, I just wish it was longer.",1365206400,,745,4.355072463768116

The original meeting of the Silver Nemesis and Doctor Who is not known to me. It is referred to during the story.
Also, a future meeting is talked about.  I would like to know if that ever happened.
I doubt it as Doctor Who ended production with Sylvester McCoy.
That would be a good story line (are you listening Doctor Who Writers?) HA!

All of the Whoniverse is worth watching! But then true Whovians know this already!",1311033600,,485,4.488636363636363
600964,3,6303145930,"I really wanted to like this story. It is the last Cybermen adventure of the Classic Series and the only encounter McCoy got with the silver baddies. However, the writer, Kevin Clarke, tried to cram everything and the kitchen sink into the story and nothing really seems to add up. We get hammy performances, flimsy dialogue, mindless running, padding in a 3-part story, and a rip-off of an earlier story of this season Remembrance of the Daleks (which was much better by far). Amidst it all, Silver Nemesis remains watchable, but only just. It's a fun trip the first time and seeing the Cybermen could mean a lot to someone, but there's not enough there to merit multiple views or even appreciation. It's easily one of the weakest McCoy stories, down there with Dragonfire, Time and the Rani, and Paradise Towers.

The story (if I can call it that) revolves around the living silver being, the Silver Nemesis which grants lots of power to the wielder (like the Hand of Omega in Remembrance... hmm...) and it was sent into orbit by the Doctor in 1963 and comes back in 1988 (hmm... Remembrance... again?) and the only reason this is the 25th Anniversary episode is because the 1st part aired on November 23rd 1988 and the original pilot of the show did the same back in 1963. Difference there, is the pilot was much, much better. From here things just get weird. There's the Fourth Reich, Lady Peinforte and Richard her servant who travel into the future to claim the Nemesis, both armed with the means of waking the thing, the Silver Bow and the Silver Arrow. But look, the Cybermen want it too. Lord...

It's 3 episodes of plain muddle. There's no clear story and the music is God-awful. There are so many wooden performances and only Richard is likeable here. The Seventh Doctor and Ace continue to bond together and show great chemistry with strong performances and the action is really cool, especially for back then, even if that gold weakness is taken a bit far. Visually, it is impressive, and there is over 20 minutes of deleted or extended scenes that are worth admission alone.

Another weakness however is the DVD itself, lacking the Extended Version put on VHS years and years ago. It's a shame, as the added stuff is much better and makes for a more fun episode. Not even all of the deleted materials are here and the making of commentary pales to the VHS version. This could've been a highlight for McCoy, really. Sadly, this idea never became a story and those Cybermen were wasted. A pity really.",1307404800,,2513,4.655405405405405
600965,2,6303145930,"Every Who fan has their Favorite Doctor, and their favorite stories. Growing up I had very little exposure to the 6th and 7th Doctors do to my mother's dislike of them and not having any episodes. Now that I'm older and can afford these awesome DVD releases I'm trying to broaden my horizons and check out these missed stories. So far my attempts to watch the 7th Doctor have been irritating. It's not that I don't like Sylvester McCoy or Sophie Aldred in fact it's the opposite. I find that their dynamic is the only redeeming quality to these stories.

I bought Silver Nemesis on a whim because I love the Cybermen and wanted to see more of them, unfortunately their contribution to this story is little more then an after thought. Though the scenes they have are decent and the Cyber Leader is still well in character it just seems annoying that these amazing powerful and frightening creatures are here for cannon fodder and extended cameo appearance. One particularly good bit is the priceless way the cybermen looked at each other after The 7th Doctor jams their signal.

The story of the Nemesis itself is not very interesting and appears to be nothing more then a rehash of ""The hand of Omega"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Remembrance-of-the-Daleks-Special-Edition-Story-152/dp/B000Z7G87W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Remembrance of the Daleks (Special Edition) (Story 152)</a>. In the real world I can understand using the same strategy against another enemy, but honestly in the world of fiction no one wants to see the same plot twice, especially only a few episodes apart.

The special features on the disk were kind of lacking though the making of documentary was interesting. It made me realize that I'm kind of glad the show was canceled in the eighties because if the plots had continued in the direction some of these writers were heading I wouldn't have cared for it at all.",1298073600,2,1964,5.169811320754717
600966,4,6303145930,"Earth 1988 The Doctor and Ace decide to relax and take in the day by listening to a local jazz group and just enjoy that nothing is going wrong. That is until the Doctor has a reminder that something is going to happen on some planet at some crucial time. Meanwhile in South America an elderly man who goes by the name of Deflore along with his personal troops have been planning and waiting for something to come to Earth. Something that he has waited since the days of WWII. In the past 1638 a lady by the name of Panefor along with her servent Richard are waiting for a local scholar to finish his mathmatical calculations and discover when an asteriod would return to Earth. Something that she helped launched and won't be returning to Earth for sometime.
  Soon the Doctor realizes that it is the Earth itself in danger and the very thing being the Nemesis Comet. For inside the Comet itself is a weapon of such awesome power and destruction that the Doctor alongside the Lady Panefor and a few others sent it into space never to be used. What the Doctor does know is that the weapon was in three peices and stolen from thier resting places. The first being a bow that Deflore took during the last days of WWII and escaped to one day bring the Reicht back to power with the aid of Nemesis. Lady Panefor held onto the arrow and with it will allow her to follow the other two pieces anywhere so long as she has the correct time and place she can use her unearthly powers to find it.
  The Doctor and Ace become tangled in an all out war between Defloures and Lady Panefor for control of the Nemesis. But when it seems that the Doctor can outwit both sides he encounters an old enemy waiting in the shadows for the right moment to strike..the Cybermen. Can the Doctor stop this new threat in the form of the cybermen and keep all the players from gaining control of the Nemesis? Will the Nazi's rule the Earth? Will the Cybermen? And what dark secerts does the lady Panefor know about the Doctor that could very well change the way we see the Doctor forever?
 On a personal note sadly this dvd does not have a very extensive amount of extras and seeing as how there are only a handful of McCoy era episodes left one would think they would want to pack in as much as possable. But not so. With  one documentry about the epsiode and with Sophie Aldred and Slyvester McCoy among a few others that's about it.",1294704000,,2407,4.337777777777778
600967,3,6303145930,"When I did my review for ""Attack of the Cybermen"", I mentioned this story and critized it. I think it was a mistake. But I still don't think it's worth more than three stars. Out of all the Cybermen stories, I think this is my least favorite. Considering it had the Cybermen in it, and that it was the show's 25th Anniversary episode, my expectations of the story were high. And I also think that after such a good season premiere, it's hard for ""Silver Nemesis"" to really top ""Remembrance of the Daleks"".

The flaws of this story is that it's somewhat lacking in action, although the action scenes they did have in it such as the gun battle between the Nazis and the Cybermen were good as well as Ace's run in with the Cybermen in part three. But for a Cybermen story and the show's 25th anniversary, I think it could have used more action in it. Also there are some unanswered question at the end. Who is this Lady Peinforte in the first place? How did she come to possess the Nemesis? And how does she know how to time travel considering she's a 17th century woman? Although I did like how they made the Doctor more mysterious in this serial. I also think that the ending of this story is way to similiar to that featured in ""Remembrance of the Daleks"".

Don't get me wrong, it's still a good story, but I think it could have been a whole lot better. It's still enjoyable though, just don't get your expectations too high as I did.",1294617600,3,1434,4.327137546468402
600968,2,6303145930,"Doctor Who in the late 80s was clearly a show staggering toward cancellation, and this story, and the special features that go along with it, show why.  We see stereotypical characters, ham-fisted over-acting, and some really poorly written dialog (but I am eeevil....)  A once-serious antagonist is reduced to a bad joke.  The Cybermen, originally written as a terrifying look into humanity's possible future if we allow ourselves to become too wedded to and dependent on machines, complete their decay into oafish posturing lummoxes who can be taken out with a slingshot.

The special features reveal that the story looks so thrown-together because it is -- the writer didn't even have an actual story idea when he went in to deliver his story pitch to the producer, but got hired on the basis of an extremely vague off the cuff presentation.  Concern for tight, serious story-telling had declined that much in the Doctor Who production office by the late 80s.

The sloppiness of the original production is matched by the sloppiness of the DVD presentation.  The VHS release of this story included extra scenes that many viewers felt enhanced the story greatly, but rather than present both versions of the story (as has been done on several other Doctor Who releases) we are only given the original TV version here.  Some of the extra scenes appear out of context as a DVD special feature, but (in spite of promises from 2|Entertain, the company that releases Doctor Who on home video) not all.  The reason?  They forgot.

Oops.

If you're a completist you may still want to get this.  Or perhaps not.  2|Entertain has rereleased several other Doctor Who stories with enhanced extras packages, they may do so with ""Silver Nemesis"" in hopes of getting fans to double-dip.

The only reason this DVD rates 2 stars instead of 1 for me is the behind the scenes information, the interviews that help show how and why this story went as badly wrong as it did.  Good material for rabid fans, but not for the casual viewer.

In general I love Doctor Who.  In the case of this particular release I'll make an exception.",1293580800,9,2112,4.803324099722992
600969,2,6303145930,"This review applies to the 2010 DVD release of Silver Nemesis, which - amazingly - is much less interesting than the old VHS release. You see, the VHS version featured an extended edition of the story with many deleted scenes worked back in; it also included a good ""making of"" documentary made by an American PBS station. Alas, while this DVD does include the deleted scenes, they are only viewable as a separate special feature (in other words, there's no option to watch the extended edition of the story); and the American documentary is nowhere to be found here.

In short, this is a lazy DVD release. Other Doctor Who stories have gotten better treatment - extended editions, new special effects, multiple new documentary features - but here, we get only one short retrospective and no fancy extended version.

Of course, the laziness of this release is easy to explain - Silver Nemesis is a much-hated serial, and perhaps rightfully so. I enjoyed this story when I was nine years old, but now that I'm older, I find that I have little tolerance for its sloppiness. Silver Nemesis suffers from a glut of poorly developed characters and concepts, and intrusive humor segments that only occasionally manage to be funny. The Cybermen - allegedly Doctor Who's second-most-important villains - serve no function in this story, except to make stupid decisions and die pathetically. And the plot, as many other reviewers have pointed out, is a rehash of the far superior Remembrance of the Daleks.

To make matters worse, the production style of 1980s Doctor Who has aged terribly. Somehow, the studio-bound Tom Baker episodes of Who look less dated to me than Silver Nemesis; cheap BBC videotape footage of a studio set doesn't look too bad, but cheap videotape footage of real-life locations (as featured here) smacks of amateur home-video making. Also, the soundtracks of Tom Baker's episodes featured real instruments, whereas here the music is all done on a dinky synthesizer. More importantly, Tom Baker and Louise Jameson were gifted and magnetic character actors, whereas Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred are comparatively flat and dull. In other words, older Doctor Who has aged better than this tacky product of a tacky time.

But perhaps I'm being too harsh. Silver Nemesis does have its good points - a fast pace, amusing action scenes, well-acted villains, and Kevin Clarke's occasionally literate dialog. But it's clear to me that Clarke didn't fully understand Doctor Who, mistakenly regarding it as some kind of dopey sci-fi comedy with no need for coherent plotting. And it's also clear to me that the BBC had no real interest in Doctor Who during the late '80s, and was perfectly willing to let it limp on with a miserable budget and poor talent behind the cameras. It's sad, really, because there's a germ of a good story in here somewhere.",1293580800,12,2859,4.9376299376299375
600970,2,6303145930,"When Silver Nemesis came out on video in the 90s, it was in the form of a greatly extended director's cut. The video was accompanied by an excellent documentary on the making of the story produced by an American PBS station. As a package, it was an excellent value and a fan's delight.

This DVD release of the story is, by comparison, a wasted opportunity. The stories from the seventh doctor's era were often poorly paced and nonsensical, in part due to extensive edits for timing. Silver Nemesis is a prime example. The added footage (more than 20 minutes' worth) in the video release wasn't just for kicks, but actually improved the coherence of the narrative by leaps and bounds. And the accompanying documentary added valuable insight into the characters and the philosophy of the writers.

I can understand why the documentary may have been left out for reasons related to copyrights, but to release this story in ""vanilla"" form when hours of extant material exists in the BBC archives is, frankly, cheap. I'm going to hold off on buying this DVD and hope it gets the ""Revisitation"" treatment as several other Doctor Who stories have.",1289952000,17,1141,4.816326530612245
600971,3,6303145930,"For all intents and purposes, Silver Nemesis was the twenty-fifth anniversary story of Doctor Who. After all it began on the anniversary of the first broadcast of An Unearthly Child and it reunited the Doctor with with the Cybermen for their final appearance in the original TV series. Yet in the cold light of day Silver Nemesis is far from the greatest Doctor Who story ever.

Though that is not the fault of the TARDIS crew though. If anything makes this story worth seeing it is Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred as the seventh Doctor and Ace. Both give this story fine performances and this is especially evident in scenes where it is just the two of them. See the end of part three for a really good example of this. Yet while McCoy and Aldred give good performances they can;'t make up for the other faults with them.

The supporting cast is a really mixed bunch. While both Fiona Walker as Lady Peinforte and Anthon Diffring as De Flores are fine actors, in this story their performances in this story are hampered by a tendency to be over the top, especially in Falker's exit from the story. That said both have some nice moments: Diffring at the start of part one and Walker at the end of part three (right before her over the top exit). Gerard Murphy proves to be the best of the supporting cast as Lady Peinforte's servant Richard who gets some of the story's best lines. The story is also memorable for its three cameos the first two (and best) from jazz musician Courtney Pine and actor Leslie French (who was considered for the role of the first Doctor incidentally) and a cringe worthy one from actress Dolores Gray. As I said it's a mixed bunch.

This story features the final appearance from the Cybermen in the original TV series. This is not the silver giants finest hour by any means. First off the redesigned Cybermen costumes are far too reflective for their own good. Even worse the Cybermen's vulnerability to gold is taken to extremes thanks to the almost ludicrous beginning of part two. While the Cybermen get some good usage (especially in part two's battle) one knows the story is in trouble when the Cybermen's best moments are their hilarious reactions to jazz music. As I said not the silver giants finest hour.

That said the story does have pluses. Being shot entirely on location the story makes good use of its locations with place's like Peinforte's Estates and the disused factory buildings. The special effects hold up pretty well, especially the Nemesis in space. That said things like the Cybermen's ship in part two don't hold up as well. The score by Keff McCulloch is one of his better scores and stands up as one of the better scores of the McCoy era and gets to shine thanks to the isolated score option on the DVD. Of course there's the script.

Kevin Clarke's script is as much a mixed bag as the supporting cast. While the script has a good idea at the heart if it there's the problem that the idea had been previously used in Remembrance of the Daleks earlier in the season. Even worse, while Remembrance served as a sequel to both An Unearthly Child and the Dalek stories of the 1980's, Silver Nemesis makes the same mistake that Timelash did: it's a sequel to an unseen story. One feels as though they should all ready know what's going on and feels bad when they don't. The script has other problems like why considering the Doctor worked for UNIT in fighting alien invasions he goes seeking the help of the Queen of England in getting the help of the armed forces amongst other inexcusable plot holes. The story does have good moments like the last five minutes of part three and how Clarke builds up tension (even if it never really pays off). It isn't a great script but it'll do as the saying goes.

The DVD release of the story is a good one, though it is lacking. It's lacking because it is missing two things that the original 1993 VHS release had: an extended version of the story and the PBS produced making of documentary made concurrent with the story's production. Of the two the least missed is the documentary, which wasn't included due to rights issues in clearing it over twenty years after it was made and the Industrial Action documentary on the DVD more then makes up for it though it would have been nice to have it nonetheless. More noticeable is the extended version of the story which added more scenes that helped to flesh out the possibly convoluted plot and while most (but not all) of the scenes from that extended version are here, the DVD release is left lacking as a result. Outside of those two issues though the DVD release is a good one. There's the aforementioned making of documentary Industrial Action and deleted/extended scenes, a fine audio commentary (featuring Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, script editor Andrew Cartmel and director Chris Clough) and all the usual special features you expect from an original series Doctor Who DVD. The result is a good DVD release but would that could have shined if given the chance.

Silver Nemesis is a mixed bag. It faults from a mixed supporting cast, the Cybermen's not so finest hour and script issues. But with fine performances from Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred and Gerard Murphy to nice production values and special effects Silver Nemesis is thankfully not quite a disaster. In truth it falls into the category for stories that should have been better especially as this was an anniversary story. Then again every Nemesis has a silver lining...",1289952000,,5489,4.6467559217301755
601032,3,6303145930,"I decided to write this ""review"" in case anyone had the same question I had: does this release contain both the transmitted version and the special extended edition that was released onto VHS in the early 1990's.  The answer is it only contains the transmitted version... sort of.

The extended version is only available as part of an extended and deleted scenes compilation that is included on the disc.

As for the story itself, I gave this 3 stars mostly based on the story.  It's a Cybermen story and that's about the best thing that can be said of it.  It's not one of the monsters' best stories.  And, as a 25th anniversary story, Remembrance Of The Daleks probably makes a better one to celebrate the series with.

Edit: After viewing the entire contents, I wish to expand a little on my previous entry.  I sense a future double dip coming.  There are only 3 episodes to this story and past DVD releases of Who like Genesis Of The Daleks easily hold 6 episodes.  So, they could have included both the transmitted and extended versions of the story on this DVD.  Either with branching or including 2 copies on the same disc.  Plus, the making of documentary from NJN TV is not included like it was on the VHS release.  There is a documentary made especially for this DVD, though, but, its absence is notable.  Plus, the VHS release bloopers and outtakes are not present on this DVD.

The DVD does provide some insight into why this story does not hold very high when compared to something like Remembrance Of The Daleks.  (The stories are fairly identical to each other.)  Lots of production problems plagued this story.  Scenes are vastly reordered or just plain missing.  One such scene that is on the DVD has De Flores wearing a pair of Cybermen headphones because he's in the process of being cyberized.  Then, in the next scene to feature De Flores, the headphones are gone!  The DVD production notes subtitles track explains the missing scene.  Such revelations are decidedly necessary given how rushed the production was; the final result shows its warts and all.  Warts being predominantly what are on display.",1289520000,,2124,4.696476964769648

*** When this story was released on VHS in the early 1990s, it came out as the Silver Nemesis Extended Edition, where 11 minutes of the footage originally cut from the finished episodes to fit the timeslot was rather crudely reinstated. The version on this DVD is the broadcast version, without those 11 minutes put back into the episodes. Most (but not quite all) of that material can be watched in the deleted scenes package in the special features, along with some scenes that were not reinstated. That VHS edition also contained a 60-minute documentary that was live on set during the making of this show (very like Doctor Who Confidential is nowadays on the new series). That documentary was made by American PBS' New Jersey Network, and has not been included on this DVD as it was felt the rights clearances these days would be too expensive for this title.",1289433600,3,3019,5.095528455284553
601034,4,6303145930,"The adventures of the 7th Doctor and Ace are some of my favorite Doctor Whos of all.  Silver Nemesis throws the kitchen sink at you: a living metal statue, a witch from the 17th century, Cybermen, and Neo-Nazis.  What's going on?  Ask until the end and you still won't know--how can someone write like that?  Doctor What the hell was that?  I love the older Who shows for their lack of story continuity and sheer nonsense story-telling.",1288915200,,436,4.6103896103896105
601035,4,6303145930,"""Silver Nemesis"" is to the 25th anniversary of ""Doctor Who"" what ""The Five Doctors"" and ""The Three Doctors"" were to the 20th and 10th, with the notable exception that, unlike those two, this one isn't at all special.

The story centers around a woman from centuries ago, the Cybermen from the future (more or less), and Ace and the Doctor in the present. There's also some neo-Nazis thrown in and lotsa gold, cause the Cybermen are as allergic to it as modern kids are to peanuts. The Cybermen, the woman and the neo-Nazis are all trying to get their hands on a statue made by Rassilon to protect Gallifrey and... zzzz...

*offscreen poke with stick*

Hmmm? Hmph?! Oh, sorry. Yeah, this is a pretty boring story, really. There's not much to recommend it, except that it is the start of the darker turn for the 7th Doctor. That alone makes it worth watching, plus it's always fun to see the Cybermen before they turned into weird alternate universe versions of themselves, never to be seen again apparently.

There's quite a bit to recommend the DVD, however, including commentary, some behind-the-scenes stuff, and, well, it's the 7th Doctor and Ace! That alone makes it worth buying. :)",1288483200,,1187,4.747572815533981
601036,5,6303145930,"This was one of the best adventures of the seventh Doctor.  Not only does he and Ace face the wrath of the Cybermen, but they also have two other nemeses as well.  One a mysterious lady from the Doctor's past who time travels to the future with her reluctant servant and the second a faction of Germans soilders who want to reign a The Fourth Reich.

The prize?  A mysterious comet that falls to Earth.  All three want it and it's up to the Doctor and Ace to stop them!

Overall, it was a great ending to the original Cyberfleet and we also get an insite to the Doctor's ""dark"" past.  A must see!",1280361600,,596,4.175438596491228
601037,2,6303145930,"I'd only seen bits of ""Nemesis"" on PBS nearly 20 years ago, and resolved to see it.  Unfortunately, the story never becomes more than bits of a better ""Who"" story, with hints of ""Earthshock"", the last great Cybermen story.  At only 3 episodes, the story has little room to move its characters around, leading to the paradoxical result of a Who story that's too long and too short all at the same time.  The Cybermen are the stars of the show - the Nazis are like afterthoughts easily dispatched by the steel-men, and convenient cut-outs who keep the more interesting characters from confronting each other.  (The Nazis seem to know enough about Nemesis, but are completely baffled by Cybermen who are impervious to their submachine guns and their Wagnerian flattery.)  Unfortunately, the story isn't one worth headlining - and they spend more time just stalking around and catching gold-shot from the Doctor and Lady Peinforte.  (These are easily the most vulnerable Cybermen of the entire series.)  As the wily 17th century sorceress, Fiona Walker practically steals the show as Peinforte - already a known enemy of both the Doctor and the Cybermen.  Walker gives her character a tremendous presence and snags some of the best lines.  (She makes her trip into our era accompanied by a bodyguard with a murderous history of his own; when he gets cold feet before the trip, Peinforte admonishes him ""have the courage of your convictions"".)  The problem with Peinforte is that the story hints at a backstory linking Peinforte with the Doctor, making you wish that you'd watch that story instead.  There is some great hand-held camerawork, and when the action gets going the pace keeps your mind off the gaps of the plot, and the Cybermen themselves have a great entrance.  Otherwise, this was forgettable Who.  If you're in the mood for Cybermen, grab ""Earthshock"" or even ""Revenge of the Cybermen"".",1181606400,2,1897,4.927672955974843
601038,4,6303145930,"I'd say from reviews of this story that Silver Nemesis is one of those Dr Who tales you either love or hate.  For the record, the story involves a living metal which was sent into orbit by the Doctor, but which crashes to Earth in the late twentieth century.  Its arrival heralds the appearance of the Fourth Reich, the time-travelling medieval Lady Peinforte, and the Cybermen.  Okay, so this episode has some pretty silly concepts (anything orbitting the Earth with a decaying orbit would not take 25 years to go round, the Cybermen are too weedy for words - military weapons fail to penetrate their armour, yet a gold-headed arrow can do so easily (gold being a soft metal) and the way the Doctor escapes the guards in the castle just defies camp comedy).  But why can't people just enjoy this for what it is - three episodes of entertaining, sci-fi escapism.  The action is fast-paced, the story is filled with interesting characters, there are plenty of humorous touches and the music is great.  This video also contains the making of Silver Nemesis, which is a bonus.",1088553600,3,1073,4.711229946524064
601039,3,6303145930,"""Silver Nemesis"" is ""Doctor Who""'s 25th anniversary story only in the sense that Part One aired 25 years to the night after the first episode of ""An Unearthly Child"". It wasn't even the season premiere, and there wasn't a whole lot of celebrating going on. Most of the nods to ""Unearthly"", in fact, came in the Season 25 opener, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"". What made ""Silver Nemesis"" the anniversary -- apart from the token appearance of classic ""Who"" adversary the Cybermen -- was the plot, which purported to reveal great secrets about the Time Lord's true origin.
As an actual story, ""Silver Nemesis"" never got off the ground. Most of the best material was left on the cutting room floor, as evidenced when the extended VHS release added nearly half an episode's worth of extra scenes.
Each of the three parts of ""Nemesis"" contains one utterly pointless extended sequence that adds nothing to the ongoing story, except lame laughs. In Part Two, 17th century villainness Lady Peinforte is stalked through the streets of 1988 Windsor by a couple of skinheads, who repeatedly berate her as a ""social worker"". What the heck is that about? In Part Three, Peinforte takes a long car ride with a tourist from Virginia, who speaks in the most inflated Southern accent since the movie ""Steel Magnolias"".  All right, this actually gets funnier in retrospect, but it sure wasn't amusing in 1988.  In Part One there is some promise, as ""Doctor Who"" veteran Nick Courtney makes an unbilled, dialogue-free cameo as a tourist at Windsor Castle. A stand-in for the Queen also shows up, walking her dogs.
The best version of ""Nemesis"" that exists is neither of the ""official"" ones (broadcast or VHS). A ""lite"" edit circulated around the Internet a couple of years ago, which eliminated all of the go-nowhere scenes listed above, and replaced them with the most interesting extra bits from the VHS release. The story is made markedly tighter by this substitution, while still coming in at a manageable three parts. The most interesting alteration is the change of cliffhangers: Part Two no longer ends with the non-terrifying revelation that ""thousands"" of Cybermen spaceships are orbiting the Moon. Instead, it concludes with a screech as the story's Nemesis -- the living Gallifreyan statue forged as the ultimate weapon of mass destruction -- comes to life in a shower of impressively digitized sparks. As the story is really about the Nemesis (not the Cybermen) and what she knows about the Doctor, ""Silver Nemesis"" takes sharper focus when she's given center stage.
But ""Silver Nemesis"" ultimately cannot deliver on any meaningful level. It asserts that the Doctor has ""secrets"", about ""the old time, the time of Chaos"". However, no matter how you edit the story, those secrets will never be revealed. Oh, Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred still have terrific by-play together. You'll find out a little more about the Doctor's ongoing chess game with the shadows in Lady Peinforte's study, solved in the following season's ""Curse of Fenric"". However, it will still end with Ace asking the Doctor, ""Who ARE you?"", and will still end with Sylvester shushing her. That's not an anniversary. That's just par for the course.",1074384000,23,3210,4.986940298507463
601040,5,6303145930,"In an untelevised adventure in 1638, the Second Doctor launched an asteroid containing a statue made of the living metal (yes, living metal) validium into space, but got the sums wrong, so that its decaying orbit would lead it back to Earth on 23 November 1988 (read, Doctor Who's silver jubilee).
Three parties are striving to control the statue, named Nemesis:  Herr De Flores, leader of a band of neo-Nazis, Lady Peinforte and her servant Richard, and that silver menace whom De Flores calls the Giants (q.v. Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen), the Cybermen.  The Doctor and Ace get involved in this when the former's alarm sounds at a Courtney Pine concert.  They jet back and forth from 1988 to 1638 to discover answers, answers that the Doctor already knows but is keeping from Ace.
Our heroes must gain possession of the Nemesis to correct the Doctor's mistake, and it ends triumphantly when the everybody in the other three parties perish, save one.
Dolores Gray has a pleasant moment as a kindhearted Virginian tourist who gives Lady Peinforte and Richard a lift in her limo, replete with accent.
And the pair of skinheads mistaking Lady Peinforte and Richard for social workers is cause for a chuckle or eye rolling.
The concept of a comet causing events on Earth with its arrival every 25 years is interesting, as evidenced by the eve of the Great War (1913), the Anschluss of Austria (1938), Kennedy's assassination (1963), and the Cybermen invasion of Earth (1988).  What other events did the Nemesis influence?  The eve of the War of the Ausberg League (1688), the eve of the French Revolution (1788), the Battle of Gettysburg (1863)?  Maybe.
A few questionable aspects to this story is the use of the Gregorian calendar (1752) in England re the Doctor's calculations, the motives of the Cybernized people shooting at the Doctor and Ace after the concert (maybe they also hated people whose alarms went off at concerts), and the existence in 1638 of Roundheads.  Still, this doesn't detract from the story.
The Cybermen outfits must be brand spanking new compared to Attack Of The Cybermen, as they are polished and glittering, and as such, are a sight to behold.  Still, glitter does not obscure the fact that they are still easily killed by gold coins, unless they were made with sharpened edges--who knows?
This is the second of what I call the ""Ace Enigma Trilogy,"" the first being Dragonfire, the third being The Curse Of Fenric.  For those who don't know what's going on, think--who moved the chess pieces after the Doctor's first visit to Lady Peinforte's house?  And why does he bother playing the game in the first place.
 Pity the series ended with Survival, otherwise we might have seen the story where Gainsborough did his painting of Ace.
Following the story are outtakes and a making of documentary, where the viewer gets to see the use of glowing paint for the Nemesis bow, Cyberleader David Banks demonstrating his new Cyber costume, rehearsal sessions in the BBC studio, the importance of first showing actors firing guns the safety catch, and other things.
As a silver anniversary celebration, Silver Nemesis, and its companion documentary has its hearts in the right places.",1010102400,11,3206,4.8966789667896675

7841273,5,6303145930,"honestly, I've gotten to that point where I have learned not to care about what other people say about certain episodes when it comes to doctor who.  it is clear that what is one person's trash is another person's treasure.  it has so often occurred that episodes many hate, I have loved, and episodes that are sometimes hailed as great, i'm not that much in love with.  such is the case with silver nemesis.  as is the case with many 6th doctor and 7th doctor stories, I've heard that most of their episodes suck.  but despite the naysayers, I decided to give them a try, and I have almost never been disappointed.  the same goes with silver nemesis.  I honestly had a great time watching it.  the only think that I would recommend is watching it with subtitles, bc its easy to miss things.  yet that can be said for doctor who in general, be it a classic or new who episode.  there's just so much to the plot that its easy to overlook.  yet it was great.  once again, the writing/direction and acting was top notch, and with this being my third 7th doctor episode that I've seen, he grows on you like fine wine.

All I can say is....meh. The Cybermen looked cool, as always. But the story just left me flat. I DID like the villainous sorceress. Almost on par with the Master....ALMOST.

The story, while kind of fun, was a bit of a letdown, when you consider that this story was the 25th anniversary story for the show. I don't fault Sylvester McCoy, he was great as always. Nor do I blame Sophie Aldred. She, too, was great. I can't put my finger on why this story just doesn't sit well with me. In the grand scheme of Doctor Who, it's just not the normal awesome story.

7841276,3,6303145930,"If you liked the previous seventh Doctor story, ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", then you're in for a treat as this serial is largely the same plot: The Doctor uses a Gallifreyan artifact to destroy one of his most celebrated enemies.

""Silver Nemesis"" requires your constant attention when watching as they do not explain things for you. It is up to you, the viewer, to work it out and when you do, you're treated to a fine adventure. No, this isn't one of the McCoy era's best stories, but it is far from his worst. There are some tantalizing clues to The Doctor's true identity and hints about what Gallifrey was like in the old times, but sadly that is all they are and unless you bothered to keep up with Virgin's New Adventure range of novels, they won't matter to much.

This story isn't for everyone. If you like your stories to constantly hold your hand and tell you what's going on, you'll hate it. If you don't like 80's Doctor Who, you'll hate it. If you don't like Sylvester McCoy's Doctor, you'll hate it.

On a side note.  I think its interesting the progression the Cybermen are making.  During the Tom Baker era it was established that only gold stopped a cyberman because it coated the entire the air vents.  During Peter Davidson they merely scraped Adrics Badge into the vents to kill one.  And now Ace with a slingshot  and a bag of gold pieces drops them like trees.  Just a little interesting thought.
