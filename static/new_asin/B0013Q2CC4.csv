What I would like to say is that this is one of the best documentary's I have ever seen.  Whether or not I was part of it doesn't matter. I had no idea what it would be like or what we would see until the night of it's premiere.

War is a terrible thing.  We, as mother's are the forgotten ones. Few think of the pain and suffering a mom goes through when her child is at war. Watching the TV for hours hoping to catch a glimpse of your child, a knock at the door renders you paralyzed, the phone ringing starts the tears flowing.  Angeliki Giannakopoulos showed all of these emotions and more. She is a phenomenal director who felt all of these servicemen were her sons and all of the Mom's her sisters.  How she could interview so many women who were living with this fear of the unknown, I don't know.

If you like a true, unbiased film about real life then this one is for you.  You will laugh, tear up, feel angry, feel proud and you will cry.  It has been 8 years since we made this film, and it is still with me like it were yesterday.  Not because of my story, but because of all the Mom's stories.  They will forever be in my mind.",1398124800,,1264,4.032128514056225
