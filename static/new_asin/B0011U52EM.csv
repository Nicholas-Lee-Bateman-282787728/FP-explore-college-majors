8242393,5,B0011U52EM,"I loved this movie. It gives you hints. You think you understand then it hits you with it and you realize you didn't know the whole truth. The characters are all deeper than they appear at first. Teh plot is deeper than it seems. The move makes oyu laugh, cry and gasp.
It's a goodun.",1390521600,,284,4.181818181818182

8242396,5,B0011U52EM,"A very good story about small town USA.  Two boys, best friends, one black one white.  Lots of issues there but the two are very good friends.  The father of the white boy catches the two boys together and thinks they have been intimate with each other.  They are too young to know about intamacy betwen adults but too bad. The black boy is sent off the property and the white one dragged home.  The father abuses the boy as only two males can.  The wee black boy has come to the house to check on his friend.  He interrupts the events but sees whats happening.  This story is shown in flashbacks as the boys are now men and living their lives.  They stopped being close that day when the abuse happened but there tale has to continue.....  A movie very worth watching by any adult.  Makes you think and pulls the compassion strings big time.  In adulthood the white boy has a blind brother he lives with.  He attempt care but the black man returns and is a real brother to the blind one.",1339804800,,988,4.275675675675676
8242397,3,B0011U52EM,"I first off was like most other people who wanted this movie, I love Gale Harold and think he's a great actor.
Also Michelle Clunie from QAF is in this also.
The movie was just ok for me though, all the perfomances were great, but I guess I was expecting more from the story. The trailer you watch makes you think you're going to see something completly differnt when that's not the case at all.
I watched it once and probably won't again for a long time if ever.",1277683200,,463,4.213483146067416
8242398,1,B0011U52EM,This movie makes white people from the south look terrible.  They are portrayed as owning nothing.  There is that black woman who owns a restaurant and a black man who owns a store but all the whites are poor white trash except possibly a white older woman who may or may not own a beauty parlor and who chases the black store owner because everyone else in town (white) are trash with their teeth turning brown from tobacco (her words).  This movie plot was good but the uneven way the director trashes whites is wrong.,1254268800,4,520,4.4526315789473685
