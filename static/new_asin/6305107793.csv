965010,4,6305107793,"I love yoga, and I love my baby, and this video has allowed me to introduce the two.  The video wastes a little time in set-up and even in the middle - I don't see the point to the baby dance when you are in your living room and there are no other babies to meet - and other than resenting that the video tries to take up too much of my precious, carefully timed good-mood moments with the baby... I just fast-forward and do what works.  There are so many different abs exercises that you really will start feeling better and stronger in your center - even if you can only do this video once a week.  Many of the baby-centered exercises are towards the end (there is some marginal participation before that) so it's actually easy to split it up:  if baby is in a napping mood, do the beginning part, and finish the end later when baby wants more interaction.  I think this is workable, even with a fussy little one.  I don't mind the new ageyness mentioned in other reviews, because the video reminds me of all those yoga classes I used to go to in San Francisco...  I must be desensitized....",1018224000,7,1093,4.276699029126213
965011,5,6305107793,"I really enjoyed this workout and I loved the experience with the baby. There were times that the baby fussed and drooled on me but that was no excuse for me not to do the exercises. The instructor does come off a little ""far out"" but it *is* yoga and I just kept an open mind to the whole experience. In other words I wasn't expecting a ""1-2-3 kick your leg"" kind of workout when I bought this video. I felt closer to my baby and refreshed after I completed the tape. My three-month-old loves to watch the other babies on TV and is actually soothed by the instructor's voice. I recommend it especially if you are interested in physical and mental health!",1009843200,,655,4.333333333333333
965012,5,6305107793,"I really enjoyed this video.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I was looking for something to center myself as well as get my body back in shape, and this video truly is an inspirational experience that I can share with my son.  He also loved being held, rocked, lifted into the air and set on my shins for a great ab workout!  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for more than just a workout -- it is something to share with your new child as well as a calming and centering experience for you. We look forward to this every day!",982454400,14,543,4.252427184466019
965013,4,6305107793,"I liked this tape a great deal.  Its a really good workout - you are definitly sweating by the end of it.  But the instructor does quite a bit of new agey stuff [which I fast forwarded through] and she gets a little  annoying.  As mentioned previously, my baby did not like the workout part  [being used as a weight, etc].  However, she *really loved* the 'baby yoga'  and massage towards the end and we enjoyed that together frequently.  I  think it was really great for her.  She also liked watching the other  babies on the tape, which I thought was cute, too. I ended up doing this  workout mostly while my baby was napping though.  I think this is a good  way to get in shape after delivery, but you have to kind of ignore the  instructor at times and fast forward through parts that aren't working for  you.",943747200,53,813,4.32
965209,4,6305107793,"I love doing this workout with my baby. I have the Giam postnatal workout and I only ever get 1/3 of the way through it before my baby wakes up and wants me to do anything but yoga. With this video, I can do it while he's awake and he doesn't fuss one bit! The first part of the workout has the baby lying on the floor in front of you while you do the workout. My baby loves looking at the other babies and seems to like the instructor's voice as well. it's the only thing he ever pays attention to on the TV. He also absoutely loves the part of the workout that involves him as a weight (his first giggles were while doing this video) and I get a great workout by using him as a weight. The workout is kind of short, but I think my baby might lose interest if it wasn't. I love the chanting and visualization too. It is like being in a real yoga class, not just some baby arobics. Don't get this video if you don't like yoga (and therefore the chanting.) My only complaint is that there could be more traditional yoga poses. This workout is very much about strengthening with repetitions of crunches, squats, and leg lifts, not really the relaxing sort of strength-building yoga.",1130457600,10,1180,4.225663716814159
965210,1,6305107793,I am sure if you just want a pregnancy or post natal workout that these are fine.  I personally LOVE my yoga practice and found these videos deffinitely wanting.  They have some nice qualities but really I was unhappy.  I prefer Gaiam's videos.,1123632000,7,244,4.627906976744186
965211,5,6305107793,"I was desperately seeking a workout that would involve my son; I work full time, so our time together is too precious for me to invest in a fitness routine that doesn't include him.

I was hesitant to purchase this DVD after reading the negative reviews berating the workout as being too ""new age-y"" -- but I'm so very glad that I did!  My son and I both absolutely love the workout.  It's tough enough for you to work up a good sweat (particularly if you have a big baby like I do), but it's also fun and great bonding time for you and baby.

Like many others, I found the chanting a bit over-the-top when I started the workout, but now I've participated a few times and have found it's actually quite relaxing and focusing.  My advice would be to give it a shot before dismissing it out of hand.

My son enjoys watching the other babies on the TV, and absolutely loves the resistance exercises where he gets to go for some great rides while Mommy builds her upper and lower body and core strength.  He adores the baby yoga, and several of the stretching exercises for Mommy engage baby as well.

If you're looking for a workout that will challenge you while also involving your baby, try this workout.  It's a huge hit in our house!",1111017600,18,1234,4.353711790393013
965212,1,6305107793,"What a waste of money!  The introduction was a waste of time to listen to and it didn't get any better after that.  I thought I could do some Yoga with my baby, but that was only for a couple of minutes.  My baby was lying down most of the time, like all the babies in the video, since there wasn't much techniques to incorporate them. I can't stand the instructor's voice, which sounded like a nagging tone.  The session ends with everybody holding their babies and moving around and she calls it dancing!",1106352000,8,506,4.351063829787234
965213,3,6305107793,"This series by Ms G Khalsa has its place. While the production is well presented I would not recommend it for anyone who had not been doing yoga for a long time, in otherwords a seasoned yogi. There is a lot of chanting, visualisation and a really new age/ esoteric feel to this DVD. While I have done yoga in various styles and with various teachers, I found this DVD patronising and over the top. I feel I wasted my money buying this product. What I would recommend is Lisa Hart's Fit Mamma. Now there is a routine that you want to get up for and Ms Hart is 8mths pregnant while she presents it and is a breath of fresh air. I use Ms Hart's DVD three times a week",1083283200,10,665,4.083969465648855
965214,5,6305107793,"I almost didn't buy this video because of the negative reviews.  I thought that it was going to be very difficult from what others were saying.  I think that it depends on a person to person basis.  I didn't really have time to work out when I was pregnant, but had prevoiusly gone to the gym regularly, so I was really feeling out of shape.  I got this video three weeks ago and have been doing it with my now 7 week old.  I tend to like more upbeat music when I work out because it keeps me going, so I watch the video but turn the sound down and play the radio or a cd.  I like how at the end of the video it is all bout baby, this way you both get something out of it.  My son loves the attention and it has become part of our morning routine. I am so glad that I bought this video, I can already feel and see a difference.",1081382400,5,827,3.8294117647058825
965215,4,6305107793,"I got this and the pre-natal video together. I guess she went easy on us while we were pregnant, because I was surprized by how difficult some of the moves in this post natal video were for me. I didn't get around to working out until 3 months after I gave birth and I still couldn't do some of the things like roll backwards on my back and hold my legs straight up in the air. It took 7 more months before I was able to do that, but I still can't roll back and forth while holding on to my feet. Aside from those two things, I had a great time doing these exercises and my daughter enjoyed it too. Now that she's cruising around she doesn't like to lay still but the stretches that give her a chance to move and be lifted up and down are still exciting for her. She also likes to look at the other babies and their mommies on the video. The whole mood is very relaxing and peaceful, yet I still wake up the next day feeling like my abs have had a great work-out.",1074643200,5,963,3.994818652849741
965216,3,6305107793,"I was a little disappointed in this workout.  First of all, I really didn't like the long verbal introduction to yoga by the instructor.  Also, I felt a video like this should have a new Mom as an instructor like most post natal workout videos do.  The yoga is very boring.  I did like the infant massage section at the end of the video and the section where you get to dance with your baby.  Honestly, I would get Post natal Pilates instead, it is a shorter and better workout; or or Post natal excersize for Mom and Baby.",1070928000,14,523,4.242424242424242
965217,5,6305107793,"I really enjoy this video and my baby girl does too! Having her next to me, smiling and gurgling makes exercising fun. This video allows me to spend time with my little one while doing something positive for myself. If you are used to Hatha yoga, be advised... this is a video of Kundalini yoga, which is completely different but equally as stimulating. Another reviewer stated that there were no calm holding poses, that is because Kundalini yoga has a different concept than Hatha yoga. In Kundalini, you are trying to wake up your chakras (which are energy centers throughout the body). Therefore, there is a different mentality to the poses; they are often movement based.
I think this video is fabulous for anyone who is interested in toning up after having a baby. As long as you go in with an open mind, knowing that it is different than your typical yoga classes, you can benefit from it. I love the video and only wish I could find a post-natal class near me so my baby could meet other little yoga babies!",1046995200,7,1015,4.551912568306011
965218,5,6305107793,"I had never done Yoga before so I was not sure how I would like the video.  I had gained 60 pounds during my pregnancy and was looking for a way to get it off.  I started the video when my daughter was 10 wks. Due to my C-section.  I took it slow at first but now can do the whole video, and people compliment me on how fast I got my waistline back.  Arianna is now 4 months and I have lots 40 pounds.  My stomach has gain much the muscle tone back even where I was cute.  I highly recommend this workout to everyone.  Arianna loves it and the DR has congratulated me on starting my child early in exercise.",1023148800,6,607,3.9262295081967213
7882898,1,6305107793,The DVD  inside was the wrong DVD!  I received a DVD that was an instructional video for ergo baby carrier.,1471046400,,107,4.3
7882899,5,6305107793,Loved this pre and post natal.  A lovely space to go when alone at home with your newborn.  I highly recommend.,1440979200,,111,4.238095238095238
7882900,1,6305107793,"Dangerous: Some of the positions shown in this video put baby at risk for a dangerous fall. One example, mom lies on her back, lifts her feet to create a 90 degree angle with her legs, with her shins parallel to the floor. Then baby is placed on mom's shins. I tried this. Even though I was holding on to my baby while he was resting on my shins, it was too much of a reach for me to truly secure him. He rolled right off my legs and fell a couple feet on to the floor. Good thing I had a really thick play mat under us, otherwise he would have fallen hard onto his head. So scary.

Dull: Other than that, most of the video is mom doing ""yoga"" with the baby just sitting next to her. That's not very helpful to me, as it does not occupy my baby while I'm doing yoga. And the instructor's version of yoga is actually a lot more like really basic floor exercises you'd find in a magazine (e.g., leg lifts, crunches).

Creepy: The whole thing starts off with a 20-minute interview with a middle-aged, white woman in a turban talking all ""woo-woo"" about yoga. During the instruction part of the video turban-lady sits up on a platform teaching the class in this overly breathy, new age voice. I spent most of my 20s meditating for several hours a day, so I appreciate tranquility as much as anyone. But this lady is pouring it on way to thick. Yuck.",1353801600,,1345,4.209302325581396
7882901,1,6305107793,"This should be called ""Mommy does yoga while baby rests on a blanket nearby.""  As mentioned by other reviewers, the instructor didn't even have a baby with her, and she doesn't pretend to acknowledge the presence of babies for more than 10% of the video.  Most of the poses she offers are things that can't (or shouldn't) be done holding a baby, and she doesn't even bother to suggest how one can incorporate the child in the routine.  On second thought, it should be called ""Mommy ignores crying baby while doing yoga.""  Terrible, terrible video.  Shame on this company for trying to market it as a mommy and me offer - aren't new moms subjected to enough marketing ploys??",1268179200,,674,4.630252100840337
7882902,3,6305107793,It was a very short work out. By the time i started to get into it it was over,1266105600,,78,3.1578947368421053
7882903,1,6305107793,The instructor is a bit excentric. But also it is not geared towards women in their early trimesters. If someone is looking for sunrise salutations or warrior yoga or any of the more modern yoga poses your out of luck. Maybe pop this dvd in when you are further along and you can no longer do the more typical poses. Plus if you not into the OM breathing techniques this DVD isn't the one for you. To me it just doesn't feel like the best dvd for the modern mum to be.,1204502400,,468,4.0978260869565215
7882904,1,6305107793,"I took prenatal yoga at a studio through my entire pregnancy. It was the greatest thing ever and prepared me for a beautiful easy labor and birth. This on the other hand was a waste of money. I wanted something to do with my child along the same lines as when she was  in the womb. The instructor on the video was incredibly annoying. I have had spiritual yoga teachers with very relaxed voices before, but she must have been hitting the hooka with Mary Jane if you know what I mean. Also, her style of yoga was more about repetitive movement versus breathing through your pose and letting breath bring you to your goal. If you have taken a yoga class before, you may not enjoy this at all. If you don't like people who talk like they are high, you may not enjoy this video either.",1200009600,,781,4.277027027027027
7882905,2,6305107793,"A little slow to take off, the instructor's voice is boring and a little creepy.  Would have liked a little more exercise interaction with the baby. Wasn't very unique or interesting. Very basic obvious routines, great for the beginner.",1191369600,,236,5.051282051282051
7882906,2,6305107793,"I shouldn't complain, since this was a gift, but as someone with some yoga knowledge, and years of exercise class experience, I thought this was a mess.  (I am less concerned about the vague spirituality of the instructor, since that can be ignored by those who are not interested, and it is not the main point.)  The concept of recording a real class is interesting, but the editing made it hard to follow.  The moms were doing all sorts of things, since their babies needed attention, so it's often not clear what to do - the camera would be on someone not following the exercises and attending to her baby when a new exercise began.  The instructor's counting is loopy.  It's never clear how many will be done, and the repetitions are done at different speeds, sometimes impossibly slow, sometimes impossibly fast.  Never focused on form, as we should.  There was very little about it that was yoga, and I was just stunned that the instructor would refer to ""downward dog"" as ""triangle pose,"" a very different pose.  Mostly, I think this is sloppy, with a few good exercises, but there's got to be something better out there, for moms and babies both.",1175040000,5,1154,4.650246305418719
7882907,1,6305107793,"The instructor looks like a Hindu priestess. She begins the workout by having everyone chant to their inner being.  I had to fast forward through alot. The exercises are good, but there are too few of them.",1143417600,4,206,4.5675675675675675
