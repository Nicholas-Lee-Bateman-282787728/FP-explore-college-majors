8610594,1,B00EZ4DWZW,"I pulled the plug after about 4 minutes or so; and some of that I fast forwarded through.  With the silly b-busting fem lead combined with the shaky camera work, I simply couldn't go on.  Perhaps the filmmakers will invest in a tripod.",1508544000,,235,4.441860465116279

8610597,1,B00EZ4DWZW,This movie was not deserving of any rating at all that is how bad the movie was to me.  The so-called monster was horrible.  My grandchild could do better than what I saw.  The sound was horrible it was up and down throughout the entire movie (if you can call it that).,1395878400,3,269,4.134615384615385
8610598,1,B00EZ4DWZW,Poor special effects. Confusion during plot. Not  scary. More like a Grown Children Play. Bad acting. Bad special effects. Rough draft.,1389657600,,135,5.428571428571429
8610599,1,B00EZ4DWZW,"Absolute total and utter, unadulterated boring, badly scripted, terribly acted, mind numbing trash! Even switching off brain did not work!",1385856000,5,138,5.95
8610600,1,B00EZ4DWZW,"I wish the review written on the tenth of October was written before I rented this.  It was very accurate.  I am no movie critic, I enjoy old cheesy horror movies...but this is just awful.  The camera is
real wobbly at parts (like the camera man was coughing).  I admit I did not watch it in its entirety, but, I just couldn't force myself to.  I am only writing this to agree with the first well written
review, my suggestion would be to wait a short while, when amazon prime offers it for free, if it looks interesting to you, then stream it...but, don't waste your money on this.",1381449600,9,582,4.302752293577981
8610601,2,B00EZ4DWZW,"This movie is about the Chupacabra. I think the movie is shot somewhere in Central/South America. It is a very low budget film with poor acting and writing. Both the audio and filming are very poorly done. Sometimes the local birds take over the audio, as does a fly buzzing the microphone once, to the point it is difficult to understand the dialog. You can tell they only used one microphone because the people close to the camera are loud and the distant actors have a far away/tunnel/echo effect.

The lead actress is very cute and her acting skills are somewhat better than the other actors. Jasmine Waltz plays FBI Agent Diaz investing deaths from the Chupacabra. She looks great in a white shirt and a pair of jeans.

The antagonist is the local Sheriff that dislikes women cops, does a poor macho cop impression and likes to cuss a LOT. One of the two reasons I watched this movie to the end is the hope that the Chupacabra will eat this man and they might show the Chupacabra. No acting skills whatsoever.

The Chupacabra kill scenes are basically someone shaking the camera to give the impression of an attack/struggle with a little red is placed to give the impression of blood. After the shaking, there is a posed actor in a fast death scene. So, you never really see any killing nor the Chupacabra.....til the end. I guess they saved up for one death scene and a Chupacabra visual.

The storyline created around the Chupacabra is so laughable. It's not going to be what you would expect.

Jasmine Waltz gets two stars for being so darn cute and likeable. She was the only redeeming part of this movie. I hope to see her in something better. The song at the end, woman singing, is a nice song.

Is it family friendly? The only bad parts are the curse words constantly flying out of the Sheriff's mouth. I honestly doubt kids old enough to understand the words would actually sit through this movie.

Otherwise, a bad, low budget film.",1381363200,8,1946,4.558739255014327
8610602,2,B00EZ4DWZW,"First: the back ground music it's to loud & just not good. Second: I have not seen this film(it will be out in Dec),but if You see the preview like I have then You already know that the only thing that looks great in this film is the star=Jasmine Waltz(She's sexy good looking!!!).
  When the DVD comes out,I will rent & see if the film is worth owning(who knows,maybe it is?).",1381276800,,377,4.295774647887324
