1604165,5,B00005JPH2,"A year after their adventures, the Pevensie children are chafing at their mundane lives in an underground train station on the Strand. The next thing they know, the wall behind them is moving.  It's magic, they know, and it takes them to Narnia.

But, there weren't any ruins in Narnia.  Plus, the dancing trees no longer dance.  And the beasts in the woods aren't friendly anymore.  While a year has passed in their time, it's 1300 years in the future for Narnia.

Narnia's been driven near to extinction by the Telmarines, a race of humans led by Lord Protector Miraz (Sergio Castellitto).  In the beginning, Miraz is only serving as regent for the Telmarine throne, but his wife is laboring in childbirth.  When the news comes that she's borne him a son, he sets plans in motion to kill his nephew Prince Caspian 10, the rightful heir to the throne (played by Ben Barnes).

The Pevensale children: Peter, (William Moseley); Susan, (Anna Popplewell); Edmund, (Skandar Keynes); and Lucy, (Georgie Henley) meet Caspian and after a brief dispute between Peter and Caspian, cast their and their animal and dwarven kind friends' lots in with his. They know the Telmarines will invade quickly and choose to meet the enemy offensively.

""Prince Caspian"" reminds me very much of ""The Two Towers"" in that there's quite a bit of fighting going on. From the minute Miraz realizes he has an heir, he's sending his men to kill his nephew and next to go after the remainder of the Narnians.

The story is well-acted. Lucy (Henley) and Miraz (Castellitto) were two of the most interesting characters in the whole story and were at polar opposites of the good-evil continuum.  Lucy's faithful and the strongest believer in the magic of Narnia and her old friend, Aslan.  Miraz is just plain bad, he's a kinslayer, a backstabber, and the all-around-guy-you-love-to-hate. Kudos also to Eddie Izzard for Reepicheep the Mouse. His portrayal was exactly what I imagined for the brave little mouse.

Director, Andrew Adamson did an excellent job hazing the battle scenes with grey implying the dust I'd imagine they'd stir up with the fight.  He also managed to capture the wondrous dancing trees, the mountains and the glory that is Narnia in a bright filter.

Magical creatures, particularly the centaurs, were very well done. Effects for the one scene featuring Jadis, the Snow Queen were smooth and beautifully done.

In my opinion, this is probably not a film for very young children.  There's a lot of violence and battle scenes.  While there's no splatter factor, I think the decapitations and other scenes might be hard on the younger kids.

NOTE:  If you are planning on attending ""Prince Caspian"" for the next week, you probably will want to buy your tickets in advance or see the earliest show.  The theatre tonight was full and many of the shows for tomorrow were already selling out.

1604166,4,B00005JPH2,"With More Action and Violence in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian I would say this is one of the best Narnia Movies I have seen. I do wish it had more of adventure like the first movie.
About 85% of the movie was one big battle.  It doesn't beat The ""Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy  in action, but it does have more creatures.  As a movie critic for Prince Caspian, I give this 4 out of a possible 5 stars.",1210896000,,410,4.037037037037037
1604167,3,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is every bit as entertaining as the first film in the adaptations of C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. The action sequences and special effects continue to exponentially improve, but the plot remains haplessly repetitious. While Lewis may have created countless original ideas in his novels, the movies themselves have already been beat to the punch by The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Shrek and many others, causing Prince Caspian to feel like it's borrowing elements from other fantasy fare. Entertaining but predictable, this sequel is an admirable second chapter to the Narnia saga that is sure to win over fans old and new.

Only a few years have passed in England, but thousands have drastically changed the war-torn lands of Narnia. When the heir to the throne, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), is betrayed by the scheming Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), he inadvertently summons the kings and queens of old - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley). Forming an allegiance with the scattered Narnians, Prince Caspian and the Pevensies (with the help of a little magic and a talking lion) must wage war against Miraz's Telmarine army to once again restore peace to Narnia.

The story starts right up without pausing considerably to educate unfamiliar or forgetful audiences as to the origins of Narnia, or to the magical elements that affect the Pevensie children. While many will grow accustomed to Narnia's paradisaical qualities, the children's return, without the use of the wardrobe, is rather inexplicit. Along those lines, the mysteries surrounding Aslan's apparitions, Lucy's selective use of her healing serum, and the unharnessed powers of Mother Nature all bring questions to the film; most of which are not answered.

As the children mature, so do the Shakespearean themes and tone of this darker follow-up. Tragically, the biggest downfall to the fascinating world of Narnia and its engrossing inhabitants is the fact that nearly every idea has already been expended by other movies. C.S. Lewis may have crafted many of his creative elements years before Shrek or 300, but those movies beat Narnia to the big screen. Whether it's Reepicheep, who is unappealingly similar to Shrek's Puss In Boots, or the Telmarine infantry, whose armored masks closely resemble 300's Immortal army, Narnia simply doesn't feel original. It's a shame that many viewer's first encounter with the thaumaturgical inventions will be through the film and not the novels.

Despite a Lord of the Rings: Return of the King conclusion (a comparison that fantasy films should avoid), Prince Caspian indeed amps up the adventure. Better action, superior use of slow-motion and family friendly violence (such as a PG decapitation) aid in the film's smooth pace and sustained action. A more savage, war-torn Narnia doesn't necessarily make a better one, but new heroes and villains, nonstop epic battles, and a mature setting help keep the second Chronicles afloat in the heavily treaded waters of fantasy tales.

1604168,5,B00005JPH2,"If you recall, at the end of the chronicles of Narnia movie, the professor informed little Lucy she wouldn't be able to enter Narnia through the wardrobe again, and she'd have to wait to see when she'll return. The professor was right. In this new Narnia, 1300 years had passed in Narnia time, but only one year passed in reality. Lucy appears a lot taller than the last movie, however, Peter, Edmund and Susan remains their same height. The kids are waiting in a train station, on a platform in London without their mum.
They are surprised by a gust of wind from a rushing train. The noise from the train sounds like people screaming and talking loud. They are captivated by the windows of the train. Their eyes are focused upon a beautiful Island that is seen through the train's windows.
Suddenly, they are sucked in and transported.

Soon, the kids come to learn the ruins of Narnia. They seem to have forgotten how Narnia looked before. The same excitement in the first movie, is captured again, only with more challenges the kids have to face, alone with Aslen. I can't wait.",1201305600,11,1081,4.601036269430052

1604412,1,B00005JPH2,"My daughters and I are on the Narnia series for bedtime reading.  We just finished Prince Caspian (the fourth book), and so we watched the movie tonight.  Now, everyone expects that producers must take certain liberties when making book-based films.  Print and screen are entirely different media; there will always be differences between the book and the movie.  That's art.  But THIS film takes ""editing for TV"" to a whole new level.  It's (nearly) a different story altogether, completely unfaithful to C.S. Lewis' masterpiece.  Parts that ARE the same occur at different points in the chronology and (this is my biggest criticism) in totally different contexts.  Disney has successfully minimized the moral and biblical themes these books are known for; they've ""sterilized"" it for modern viewership.  The film, ""based"" on C.S. Lewis' classic children's work, features a child actress wearing an absurd amount of makeup, a ""love interest"" between this character (Queen Susan) and Prince Caspian, and a pop music ending.  In other words, Disney put their ""stink"" all over it.  They got a portion of my $3.99 movie rental fee this time - it won't happen again.",1515715200,,1162,5.127659574468085

The original book was threadbare, but the film, though long and detailed, somehow feels equally thin. Often it substitutes vague pomposity for clarification, but some of the situations are interesting. The raid on the castle was very strong and then it continued all right until after the duel with Miraz. (A little overdramatic, but watchable.) Then it faded off again, and the silly ending with Susan--Ive flatly never understood why that was included. Ironically, most of the stuff I like best either wasn't in the original book or was noticeably changed in some way. This was always the weakest Narnia book.

1604813,5,B00005JPH2,"We enjoyed the book more than the movie.  The movie spent a bit too much time on the war itself for our taste; whereas the book built up the characters, spent some suspenseful times outside of the war, and endeared the reading to the world of Narnia.  Read this with my 7-year-old son, and he could not finish the movie.  Just our opinions.",1485820800,,340,4.365079365079365

The first installment of Disney's Narnia franchise was pretty good (if you ignore the bad music), but Prince Caspian strays much too far away from the original story and the end result is quite lame. If I don't like a movie much, I rarely take the time to give it a bad review like this, but I really hated this movie. It wouldn't be enough to get a refund of my $2.99 rental fee...

Even if a stretch from the book, I think it was necessary. And I didn't even mind the little romantic sidestory.

1605315,3,B00005JPH2,This movie compared to its predecessor from the same ensemble is a bit disappointing.  Though I do find it humorous that actors like Eddie Izzard are willing to work on a story with Christianity at its foundation.  The reason I found this movie disappointing is that it deviates from the book more than I cared for.  There are multiple points in the story involving the Prince where the movie either completely changed from the book (when Caspain blew the horn for example).  If the movie had stuck more to the storyline of the book I think would have garnered more stars from me.,1473206400,5,580,4.601941747572815

Not only changing characters to behave in ways they never did or would have (Peter and Caspian), but completely rearranging the timeline, the way certain events occurred, etc.  One would think a 2-1/2 hour movie would be enough time to tell a story fairly accurately.  Wrong.  This was literally painful for me to watch.  As a lover of the original books, I was VERY disappointed.  Even my 8 year old was quick to point out the variances from the book, and ask ""why would they do that?""  A few redeeming parts were simply not enough to salvage this Disney/Hollywood/Fluff film.

It was a bit campy but that was to be expected.  The most annoying thing about the movie was the fact that too often the stars of the show were staged as though posing for still shots when they should actually have been fighting someone.

So, as we were watching it, (me thinking I was giving him a real treat) (he's 8, btw)  he started telling me maybe I should look away as the next scene was a ""scary"" scene. After telling me several times what was going to happen next, I said ""wait a minute!  have you already seen this?""  Oh yeah, he said, five times!  Hmmm.

1606164,2,B00005JPH2,"Quick Summary version:

Decent movie. Should be PG-13, not PG due to much violence (including a beheading).  Misses target for its intended audience.

Long version:

I've been reading the Chronicles of Narnia with my daughter over the last few months. After finishing Prince Caspian, we thought it would be fun to watch the movie together.

I'll leave plot details aside since the plot of the movie in some places diverges wildly from that of the book.  It is OK with me for film-makers to take some liberties with the material if they feel it makes the movie better (in this case I'd argue their choices weakened the movie...particularly the completely unnecessary and violent raid on Miraz's castle).

My main issue with the movie is that it is overly violent.  It is generally sanitized, bloodless violence in most cases, but it is very violent for a film whose target audience would be in the 8-12 range (probably OK for the older end, NOT OK for the younger end).  SPOILER: Miraz gets beheaded (miraculously no blood) and a variety of forest creatures are left to certain death as they are trapped in Miraz's castle during the raid.  END SPOILER.  It's marketed as a family movie from Disney for goodness sake!  While again, I don't expect a director to be a slave to the books, what could have been a very sweet and exciting family film became a violent, scary movie for much of its intended audience.

Further, as a viewer, I just didn't connect with the characters very well - like the movie was trying to do too much in the time it had, and at well over 2 hours it had plenty of time.  The ""Caspian/Susan"" romance thread was ridiculous and added nothing to the movie other than a few corny scenes of teenage angst.  Frankly, the director would have been better off using the time when the Pevensies are trying to find a way to cross the chasm (in the books) to create some real character development rather than skipping that entirely in favor of the previously mentioned foray into Miraz's castle (not in the books).

To be clear, the movie isn't bad (taking off my daddy hat, and if I hadn't read the book, it may be 3.5 stars), my rating reflects that it badly misses the target for its intended audience.  There is NO WAY this is a PG movie.  PG-13 would have been a much more suitable rating.",1449014400,4,2306,4.569343065693431
1606165,5,B00005JPH2,I brought it because it was one of my childhood favorites.,1448841600,,58,4.363636363636363

You will be surprised that he could recall little details that he read at least 6 months ago. I can only find 3 movies by Disney only. I wish they have others.",1445472000,,507,4.02970297029703

If you are looking for an exciting movie, this is good. If you are looking for the magic in the works of CS Lewis, I fear you will be disappointed.",1432857600,,492,4.24468085106383

1606795,3,B00005JPH2,"LOVE the books. The books stay true to the characters, story-lines and references as they typically do.

For whatever reason, this Disney/Adamson adaptation or interpretation portrays Peter as a power hungry, lost, resentful, hopeless brat, where the book shows him the opposite. The book shows him as respectful, yielding to Prince Caspian (assuring him he didn't come to take over) and noble. This important change is set in motion early in the beginning scenes of the movie. (fight in the subway).  Same with Susan, Aslan and the dwarf Truffle Hunter, and then expanded far too long on Nikerbrick and the White Witch. This tone makes the movie much less enjoyable as the heroes are hopeless and everything is dark, evil and dim, and there is no character development other than the echo of the previous film. Maybe Adamson was trying to hard to use the modern movie themes instead of the actual book..

The added backstory of the King was ok. They filled in some gaps. but it seems this interpretation was more into the details of that then including important dialogue, the holidays celebrations, the liberation of the towns, the destruction of the bridge, etc...

Could have been an amazing movie, but fell short of C.S. Lewis's vision.",1431907200,,1241,4.923444976076555

1607023,4,B00005JPH2,"This was good. Prince Caspian's ride at the beginning was great. The rest was not quite so great as that, but still good. It was better than the previous movie, which I remember watching in the theater and not liking very much. Fortunately, the bickering was toned down some. Nobody knows how to make vicious comments like the British. I don't know why they decided to make the Pevensies the Kings and Queens of Peevishness. It's a sort of character assassination, and the Pevensies aren't the only ones that suffer from it. Trumpkin the dwarf does too.

I know some people were complaining that they changed a lot from the book. I feel that they didn't really have a choice. After all, the classic BBC version was only one hour long, so clearly they had to expand it a little. I didn't mind most of the changes, though I sort of missed the part where they are following Lucy who is following Aslan, and they gradually see him. And I liked the little romance between Caspian and Susan, though I don't think they should have kissed at the end.

The picture and the music were great. Ben Barnes is a great actor. For me, he IS Prince Caspian. So this is a movie well worth watching. In some ways, I liked it better than the book.",1428883200,,1227,4.424778761061947

The development of the characters is impressive from the first film, especially the character of Peter Pevensie. The sets are great and the adaptation from the book is done very well, though there had to be some creative and imaginative additions for movie version.  Once again the soundtrack is great. With this multi disc set you get some great behind the scenes shots and get to see the cast in off-camera situations as well as all the prep and technical work behind the film.",1423180800,,610,4.62962962962963

1607733,2,B00005JPH2,"The focus of this newest rendition of the classic Narnian tale ""Prince Caspian"" falls short of the mark the book left for it to reach.

SPOILERS AHEAD

With continuous comments such as

Lucy: ""I was so tall""
Susan: ""You were older back then""

and

Peter: ""I wasn't always a child""

the movie would have more aptly been title Back When We Were Grownups but, since that title is already taken, perhaps Remember When We Were Grownups would also suffice. There are obviously certain items that must be changed in any translation. There are some forgivable translation ""errors"" and some unforgivable ones. This movie is riddled with both.

I understand why they had to begin the movie in the fashion they did (though they could have made it harder for the Pevensie's to figure out they were in the ruins of Cair Paravel), but seriously, must Peter be portrayed in such a high-and-mighty fashion?

Peter (to Trumpkin): ""High King Peter, (pause) the Magnificent""
Susan: ""I think you could've left the last part off""

So, I do understand why they would cause such an adjustment in Peter, but that causes focus to shift from what Lewis emphasized in his work, and completely adds an unnecessary dimension to the story. But I can understand their rationale.

But must Susan and Caspian ""fall in love?"" I was seriously hoping they would not add that in the movie (not to mention it could cause for a sticky situation in Dawn Treader). I mean COME ON, really. Again, it totally detracts from Lewis' work (and the kiss was even more unnecessary than their feelings for each other).

Susan: ""Why don't you hold on to it [her horn]. You might need to call me again.""

...

Susan: ""It never would've worked, anyway.""
Caspian: ""Why not?""
Susan: ""I am 1300 years older than you...""

Adding the White Witch definitely added conflict to Disney's version, but utterly went against Lewis' intentions. Lucy was still herself, Reepicheep rocks, and Edmund's character came across nicely (in fact, him and Peter seemed to have swapped places from The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, which shouldn't be the case AT ALL, but ...), but Aslan played a terribly small part in the movie when he permeates the book.

I did (thankfully) know going into the movie that it did not stick to the book. The article (in World magazine) that I read said that most fans would be pleased with the movie rendition, and that only the die-heart purists would be disappointed. That would be me.

I did actually enjoy the movie (in spite of the stupid ""romance"" which detracts, even if separating from the film from the book), as long I did not at all compare it to the book. As a movie not based off of a novel it was pretty good. But, like almost every movie adaptation, it misses the mark ... big time when compared to the novel. However, great lessons can be learned from this latest edition of Prince Caspian. You may not want to take your small children to go see this movie even if they were okay with the first movie (this movie has more violence and ""fantastic"" [in the classical sense of the word] creatures), but Caspian is worth watching at least once.",1413331200,,3120,4.655737704918033

Take an outline of the book, maybe even the table of contents, and that is the degree that this movie is ""based"" on Lewis' story. If you have not read the book, the special effects and overall movie, the setting in particular is beautiful, worth the watch and not without value. But If you are a Narnia fan, as my family is, then you will be extremely disappointed in this butchering of the characters and heart of the story. Disney added things that were not in the book and deleted very important character building scenes that would allow the watcher a better understanding of the Narnian adventure. Essential dialogue is omitted thus changing the very nature and intent of the story. It is actually disgusting and repulsive to watch the character assassination of the High King Peter. Disney and its' film makers failed in converting the Lewis's story to the big screen.",1407628800,6,953,4.712574850299402

1607963,2,B00005JPH2,"I've just re-watched this movie version of Prince Caspian for the third or fourth time, and I keep asking myself why I re-watch it at all. I seem to continually hope that the movie will give me a taste of the magic of C.S. Lewis, and certainly the scenery and cinematography are wonderful, but it always leaves me feeling dissatisfied. Why?

My main issue with this movie is that it misses the essence of the Narnia story. Yes, of course, they mess up the plot and have a ridiculous storyline between Caspian and Susan, but I realize that these types of changes are inevitable when a book is converted for the big screen. What I feel the moviemakers don't appreciate is that Narnia is NOT an epic; its make believe. It is not the Lord of the Rings; it is a children's play-world made real. Because they miss this they miss the lightness, sweetness, and hopefulness of the world Narnia.

In a child's play-world there is no worry about how that world connects to real life. A child doesn't ask ""If I die here, what will happen to me at home?"" A child lives in the world that they created with complete commitment but without worry about the effects on their real life. Lewis never really explores what effect it had on the Pevensie children to have grown twice to adulthood because that is not the point. The fact that the movie chooses to have Peter full of angst because he is not being treated like the adult that he was, shows that they are being too literal in the working out of a fantasy.

I also find it ridiculous that Peter and Caspian have a struggle for power, when in the book each easily recognizes the role of the other. Children may squabble over who gets to play the king, but that is a break from the story and not part of it. The movie version creates a more adult world full of self-doubt and insecurity, which is surely more like our reality, but not like the world of imagination. In a child's imaginings everything has its proper place and its proper order. There is no tension between two valid claims to the throne--it is a clear battle of right versus wrong.

This same applies to Peter's doubt about Aslan. Childlike faith gets its name for a reason, and children have a beautiful sense of implicit trust. Yes, only Lucy could see Aslan at first, but Peter or Susan or Edmund never thought that Aslan had abandoned them. Nor was Peter ever tempted to ask for help from the White Witch. They were secure in Aslan, even when they could not see him.

The creators of this movie version of Prince Caspian miss the playfulness of the story, and instead they weigh it down with angst, doubt, contention, and conflicted death. They forget that Narnia is for children. Where Lewis sketched the outlines of a battle, the moviemakers paint a tortured scene of a trapped and abandoned remnant. Where Lewis created a sweet world of order, hope, joy, and beauty, the moviemakers add dampening realities trying to make everything ""authentic."" They are like grown-ups asking children, ""Yes, honey, but if you die in your make-believe world, what would happen to you here?"" ""But how could you be an adult twice?"" ""Where do you think you saw Aslan?"" By failing to revel in this story through a child's eye, these moviemakers demonstrate that ""being too old"" excludes you from Narnia for a reason.",1406764800,6,3305,4.566610455311973

Yes good acting and very clever special effects. One variant I thought interesting was making Prince Caspian old enough to contemplate a romance with Susan, but the rest of the changes show the disturbing trend of recent years of focussing on violence as a form of entertainment.

First the actors were great! Trumpkin was just as I pictured him, grouchy, yet lovable. And Skandar Keyens, Georgie Henly, and Warwick Davis as Edmund, Lucy, and Nikabrik were very good. The computer animation improved, though Aslan seemed less realistic than in LWW. Miraz was vicious and the Battle at the end of the movie was nothing short of spectacular. Now that is out of the way, here's the bad stuff... The movie was a departure from the book from the very start. Cornelius woke Caspian up and instead of asking him up to the great tower, he made him get ready to retreat. I'm of course not even mentioning that at least 2-3 chapters of the book were totally left out. And by the way Peter didn't get into a fight and the Pevensies didn't land on the beach, they landed in the forest. The apple orchard scene disappeared, oh I mean it almost was, they deleted that scene. Instead of gradually grasping that the ruins they were standing on were Cair Paravel they instantly get it. Because seeing the ruins of a castle you once ruled is an everyday occurrence. When Caspian wakes up, it's not to the kind, furry face of Trufflehunter, but to the old badger and Nikabrik arguing whether to keep him or not. And yes, I didn't mention Trumpkin because he had already been taken by the Telmarines. All of the interesting dialogue with Caspian meeting all the friendly Narnians blew away into deleted-out-of-the-movie-land. Shame on you, Adamson! And who wouldn't like The three Bulgy Bears or Pattertwig? Before Caspian gets to the how, there is a scene at the fern forest. This led to Caspian meeting Reepicheep. Well, a band of Telmarine soldiers attacked him (Wasn't in the book) and instead of The noble mouse greeting him cordially he gets ready to stab him saying, ""Choose your last words carefully, Telmarine!"" Of course he doesn't. The scene where Caspian has the parley with the Narnians, They all shout and act very hostile to Caspian. Not like in the book, where they all admire and respect him for a son of Adam. At the start of the movie, Caspian blows the horn. Not like in the book, where he blows it with much ceremony with Trumpkin and Trufflehunter. The part of the book where skirmishes and small battles happened before the horn was blown was all gone. Most of the scenes with the children and Trumpkin were lost in the forest floated away with the north wind. The worst offense of this movie, in my opinion, is the scene with Lucy and Aslan in the wood. The following scenes with Aslan leading them to the How and the festival with Bacchus and the Maenads were all gone. All of this ripping and tearing away from the book adds a grotesque amount of adding to the story with completely unnecessary scenes. Like this one, The Narnians are having a meeting to decide how to deal with the Telmarines and in a horrifying, totally made up scene, they all go raiding the Castle Miraz. WHAT?! It's here that we see Queen Susan the Gentle, turn into Queen Susan the Serial Killer. All throughout the book, Lewis talks about how ""Tenderhearted"" she was. And concerning Peter, He goes on like an immature child, squabbling with Caspian every spare moment. In the book, the first time Caspian and Peter meet, Caspian ""Was liking Peter very much, but was a bit tongue-tied."" Peter would have had ample wisdom and experience to know that he shouldn't go on a suicide mission to a impregnable castle and start raiding it! Keep in mind that that scene wasn't even in the book. After the imaginary castle raid, Nikabrik lures Caspian to call up Jadis' ghost. Question: Where was Trufflehunter and Cornelius? And Caspian, instead of responding with disgust and anger about that proposition as he did in the book, falls into it with eagerness. The Duel had two omissions. One, the dialogue between Glozelle and Sopespian was left out, and Sopespian killed Miraz in the movie, not Glozelle. Once the battle starts, it shoves all the wonderfull deeds of Aslan and the joyful parade with Lucy and Susan and the others when Caspian's nurse reunites with Caspian. Well, in the movie Caspian's nurse didn't exist. Finally, the worst and creepiest detail. At the end of the movie Caspian and Susan actually kiss each other. This was a idiotic backstory that really subtracted from the movie. In the name of Reepicheep, leave out that disgusting imaginary detail! All in all, if you like movies close to the book (Which I most certainly do), back away from this atrocity! If you never read Prince Caspian, then watch this movie. If you have read it, stay clear. It's just a pity all these awesome special effects and splendid acting were almost wasted on a movie so ridiculously far, far away from the beloved book that fathered it.",1390089600,,4901,4.68677494199536

1608463,3,B00005JPH2,"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is the second Hollywood film freely based on C. S. Lewis' Christian fairytales about Narnia. Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy return to Narnia after a 1,500 years hiatus, only to find the country occupied by a race of rapacious humans, known as the Telmarine. The native Narnians have been forced to go into hiding, or have reverted to a wild and savage existence. Peter & Co decide to liberate Narnia with the aid of Caspian, a renegade Telmarine prince. The real ruler of Narnia, the lion-king Aslan, is lurking in the background, waiting for an opportune moment to intervene

I'm not familiar with the original story, so I can only compare the second film with the first one. The religious message has been even more de-emphasized, Peter is even more troubled than usual, while Lucy and Susan are even more modern and feminist. And while the mice take care of the comic relief aspect, there is overall much less comedy in Prince Caspian than in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. And then there's the LOTR-Peter Jackson rip off factor

Still, pretty good as lighter entertainment goes, so I give it three stars. Perhaps four on a *really* good day. However, I feel I'm getting too old for Narnia. Perhaps I have learned all there is to learn from these stories?",1385769600,,1305,4.719298245614035
1608464,3,B00005JPH2,"Okay, this movie really splits me in two. I adore the books that these movies are based off of. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe followed the book beautifully, this one does not. It makes several deviations and the time line is quite... wibbly. They've added a romance between Susan and Caspian which I personally find annoying because I adore the wife he gets in the next book.

Having said that, this movie also does a brilliant job capturing the new changed Edmund. He's always been my favorite character, and honestly, he's the only one that translates properly. The scene where Edmund brings the challenge to Miraz was excellent, and the scene where Edmund crashes the White Witch's plans is also great (even if I hated that they were allowing Peter to be seduced by her plans.)

This movie's greatest failing, in my opinion, is what they did to King Peter character. They made him value his own pride over the safety and future of Narnia. That made changing the initial story necessary. That is where the problems all arise. If you are an avid fan of the book, this movie will make you upset. It has some lovely moments, but the overall feel of it leaves you wanting something more. The brilliance of the original story is missing.

Non book fans will find a enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed the first one give this one a go. Do not expect it to follow the book as closely as the other one. Still, it has some moments making it worth while.

The minor characters are nicely covered. Trufflehunter, Reepicheep, Trumpkin (DLF), Miraz, Nikabrik, They're all very true to the book characters.",1385337600,,1596,4.648936170212766
1608465,5,B00005JPH2,"I received it as a birthday present earlier this year. I had seen the movie about 19 or 17 times before on a recording.
I was happy to receive it. The acting was good, the sets, the make up, costume, the CGI was well done, and other special effects too.
Andrew Adamson is a genius and took the story to a new level and interruptated it well. There were slight changes but nothing serious I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud.",1385078400,,423,4.234567901234568
1608466,5,B00005JPH2,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian DVD was purchased to be used for a birthday gift for our son. He is very happy with it! Thanks!,1384819200,,136,4.269230769230769
1608507,3,B00005JPH2,"The best way to put this is that if you read the book, you're probably going to be wondering if the people who made the movie read this book. The film may be good on its own. But in my opinion, it deviates so much from the book that the changes might have you saying (quite a bit): ""Wait a minute!""

For those of you who haven't read the book, it's basically this. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves back in Narnia. Only this time, they find that time has worn away their castle. They run into the dwarf Trumpkin who tells them the story of Prince Caspian. He was raised by his uncle King Miraz who seems nice enough, and has declared Caspian his heir. But Miraz is angered when anyone talks of Aslan or other talking animals. Later, Miraz has a son of his own, and decides that Caspian is now expendable. Cornelius further explains that Miraz killed Caspian's father. Through accident, Caspian runs into other creatures including Trumpkin and Reepicheep the warrior mouse.

Miraz launches an attack and that puts us back to the start of the story. Lucy sees Aslan, and  EVENTUALLY the others follow Aslan. Peter and Miraz agree to decide their dispute in trial by combat. Peter wounds Miraz, and then in treason, 2 of Miraz's own followers finish him off. (With the intent to take Narnia for themselves.) The trees then attack (on the side of good), Bacchus the god of rivers comes to help, and good wins. Caspian becomes king, and Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy return to their own world.

Now to be sure, there are almost always some significant deviations when a book is put on screen. Sometimes, they are not so visible. But other times, they are visible to the point where the story suffers.

I won't go through EVERY difference, because then this review will go on way too long. But there are some standout differences that don't fit.

(1) The part where Miraz SEEMS nice at first is missing. (Evil really needs a moment to look nice to be effective. Even in TLTWATW, the evil queen seemed nice, and even likable at first.)

(2) In the book, Caspian is NOT attacked by Reepicheep. He stumbles onto him. This attack in the film really doesn't fit.

(3) In the film, Cornelius told Caspian to flee, but he never told Caspian of the murder of his father. What?! In the book, Cornelius DID tell him this important thing.

(4) Peter and Caspian meet by fighting. Again, this really doesn't fit. What REALLY happened was that Caspian was in a dangerous situation, and Peter and Edmund saved him.

(5) The dissension between Peter and Caspian is REALLY out of place. For one thing, Narnia is suppose to improve people. NOT cause them to degenerate as Peter is clearly doing. Furthermore, Caspian in the book is NOT an egomaniac. This REALLY hurts things.

(6) Caspian's advances on Susan are most certainly NOT in the book, and this is really an annoying intrusion.

(7) In the film, Miraz seems aware of treason in his ranks, but he presses forward: ""I hope you won't be disappointed when I survive."" It seems strange that he would press forward even aware of treason.

(8) Miraz did obey combat rules in the book. He did not have a 'cheat code' in place. The fact that even Miraz obeys certain rules allows us to see his murder by his own people as an atrocity.

(9) In the book, Peter did NOT offer to let Caspian have the deathblow. This is a major disappointing thing. (""It's not my life to take, it's his."") Part of what makes Peter's character is knowing that he is above this way of thinking. And furthermore, it destroys the art of the writing. Peter (and even Miraz) both fought fairly. And then Miraz commands just a little bit of our sympathy when he is betrayed by his own people.

What saves this film is Aslan himself. He doesn't enter until about after 2 hours. But when he enters, BOY DOES HE EVER! Liam Neeson is really the perfect choice to provide the voice for Aslan.

It is a good film. The scenery is nice, and you probably won't get bored. But like I said, not only are there major deviations from the book, you're probably going to notice that the structure of the story is hurt because of these deviations.

If you read the book and want to find a film that follows the book, the old 80s BBC version will serve well.

I'll finish by saying this is a good film. But if you read the book and are hoping to find it here, you're going to be disappointed.",1384128000,5,4388,4.477443609022556

1608643,5,B00005JPH2,"I was a few years late in seeing this and still very skeptical because I'd heard so many people down-talking the movie when it came out. However, since I'd just read the book and already loved the soundtrack, I decided to give it a try.
BEST AMAZON MOVIE DECISION EVER.
My husband and I have watched a lot of Amazon videos online, but none that we watched twice within the allotted rental period. This one, we did. And I almost cried both times.
There are a lot of changes from the plot of the book, but overall, I thought the changes were well-chosen and effective. The story becomes much more about Peter and Susan and letting go of their childhood in Narnia instead of Prince Caspian overtaking the kingship. And Peter's actor did a brilliant job of portraying the pain and pride as well as the peace and humility that comes with that step.
Also, you will LOVE Edmund. Especially if you're already familiar with his past from the other books. He really comes into his own here and it is so much fun to watch.",1375488000,,1011,4.440860215053763

1608717,4,B00005JPH2,I did want to own this movie to have all three of the Narnia Trilogy but this one is extremely violent with lots of battles - I allowed my daughter to watch it and she covered her eyes at half the movie but in the end she was still wanting to see it again!

1608719,1,B00005JPH2,This is more like fan fiction than an adaptation of a book. The characters bear very little resemblance to those in C.S. Lewis's story.

This past winter, I had decided to try to let them watch the first in the series, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and it was received quite well by them.  When the watched this, they loved it, and once we came home they wanted to watch it as a family.

While we were visiting relatives, we also went to the movies with the kids, and saw Despicable Me, 2.  The kids liked that a lot, but preferred this one.  Wish I was aware of more movies like this!",1373587200,,580,4.0

1608793,3,B00005JPH2,"Political intrigues in Narnia, the magical creatures have been put down by some sort of Spanish Armada, which is no fun for the forest creatures. Young Prince Caspian, tagged for assassination by his evil uncle, allies himself with the Narnians and our young kings and queens, who eventually launch a full battle against the Spaniards, mowing everyone down. Ouch! Jadis, the Snow Queen, makes an attempt to return to our world, but is foiled. Too bad - she was interesting.

The deep magic comes and talks and walks, and the four kids get transported from Finchley to Narnia once again, this time to save a rotten humanity from the ultimate battle between the Narnians and the humans. Not that much fun, although for a brief moment we dread, fear, or hope that the Ice Queen will be revived. No such luck. Okay, cool. More bloody battles, with Susan the Magnificent teenager mowing down human soldiers with her magnificent bow and arrow. Of great interest is the sarcastic dwarf, and the chivalrous mouse. Nice stuff.",1371254400,,1017,4.844827586206897

1608835,2,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is nowhere near as good as the Lion,the Witch,and The Wardrobe or the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. This movie has neither the wonder of Narnia found in LLW nor the adventure of VOTDT. This movie is lacking the quality of story the other Narnia movies provide. It gets off to an okay start and has a decent ending. But too much of this movie seems to consist of incoherent battle scenes. Action and battle seem to take over at expense of story in large parts of this movie. The battle scenes don't dominate the book in the same way the do in the movie. The castle raid was NOT in the book and was not needed. That part particularly helped the battle aspect of this film to be overdone.  The book offers MUCH more depth of story,espeically with more development  regard to the children figuring out they have returned to Cair Paravel hundreds of years later and the history of Caspian. I also could have done without the suggested romances in the movie,however brief they might have been. While the visual work on this movie is good,and I enjoyed ""The call"" enough to purchase an MP# version of the song,overall this movie disappointed me. Then there's the tension between Peter and Caspian,which is totally out of line as there is NONE of it in the book. In the book Peter and Caspian always got along fine. Moreover,Peter's character is totally butchered in this movie. The Peter from the book is strong,humble,acts like a high king should,and avoids rashness. The Peter in the movie is a jerk,is too whiny,shows arrogance at times,and makes some rash decisions. It's horrible to see such a major character portrayed so out of character.  A lack of quality story and an overemphasis on battle scenes caused this movie to be a disappointment.",1369526400,,1755,4.673139158576052

1608959,3,B00005JPH2,"If you've read the book, you'll notice there's a lot of inconsistencies.  However, many of these inconsistencies aren't super huge and don't really detract from the overall feel and outcome of the story.  Things were shortened, cut, re-written, so sadly while watching I kept thinking to myself, ""Man, this isn't like the book really at all... but I guess it still works.""  So keep that in mind when watching.  It really is ""based on the book"" as opposed to a direct translation from book to movie.

If you've never read the book, this will have the same rich fantasy feel that The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe had.  Same actors for parts that were in the first movie (which I am thoroughly grateful for), a lot of familiar characters, and some really fun new characters like Reepicheep.  And let's face it, you really can't beat Eddie Izzard as the voice for Reepicheep!

So, if you've read the book, it might be hard to really enjoy it because you may realize that while the ends are the same the means may not be fully justified by them.  If you haven't read the book, it will be another wonderful fantasy story, especially if you enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.",1366761600,,1185,4.578199052132701

Prince Caspian is a very good movie, almost exactly faithful to the book. It is, however darker and more suspenseful when compared to the first film. I love the first film and this one as well, but I have to go with the first as my favorite, mainly because it speaks to me more in volumes than what the second one does.

I have been sorely disappointed in the New Movie Adaptations and 2 out of the 3 make me angry. I grant them that the special effects are better - but the screenplay(s) are not... inaccurate and unfaithful to the books.
The only one that's barely acceptable is the first one ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", and that's the only NEW one that I own... the others are horrible!

For example Disney thought that it was ok to allow Prince Caspian to KISS Queen Susan ( Attention Disney: That NEVER happened in the book! ).

1609431,4,B00005JPH2,"NOTE: If you have not seen or read ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,"" this review may constitute a spoiler.

Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are called back to Narnia by a blast from the hunting horn Susan left behind when they left there a year ago. That's a year in London, but it has been over a thousand in Narnia. Why? Because Narnia is threatened by the takeover of Miraz, Prince Caspian's wicked uncle who killed Caspian the Ninth. Our prince is the Tenth, but may not live to rule at this rate. Miraz' wife has just presented him with a son and heir, and he has no need for Prince Caspian anymore. Indeed, he has plenty of reason to want him dead. And not just because he's way, way better looking than his rotten uncle, either. Although that turns out to matter a good bit to Queen Susan.

When the children return to Narnia, they are not yet aware of what called them back. They are delighted to be there until they realize that the ruins on the top of the hill are actually of the castle where they had ruled. It's been something like 1,300 years since they left, and Narnia was conquered not long after they returned to London. They encounter dwarfs who remember that there had been The Kings and Queens of Old, as well as Aslan, whom they have not seen in a long time. The dwarfs, the talking animals, the centaurs and minotaurs, and assorted stalwart denizens of Narnia, take on the evil Miraz, who has crowned himself king, and his minions. So most of the story centers around warfare of one sort or another, but it's not blood-splashing warfare.

To me, the highlight of the film is when King Peter, stalling for time as much as anything because Lucy has gone to find Aslan, challenges King Miraz to single combat, with the winner to accept the total surrender of the loser. We all know Miraz won't play fair, as just before the combat starts, he whispers to his minister to use his crossbow if the battle seems to be going against Miraz. I'm not going to give anything away here, because it is pivotal to the plot as well as the most dramatic part.

And don't blame me if you get to feeling maybe Narnia and Middle Earth have a great deal in common. As Joseph Campbell would doubtless point out, both are based on classical hero myths, and so it's not surprising if they seem somewhat similar, right down to the giant elemental who . . . no, won't spoil it for you.

It's fun. I didn't like it quite as much as I remember liking Narnia 1, but I liked it.",1336953600,,2483,4.3542116630669545
1609432,4,B00005JPH2,For a sequel a good overall movie for all!  Highly suggested for children.  Falls a little short of the first Narnia Movie.  Overall I recommend this if you enjoyed the first Narnia Movie.,1336262400,,188,4.636363636363637

Naturally I had high expectations for the movie. And I am pleased to say Prince Caspian far exceeded my expectations!! The animation was totally believable, the actors did an amazingly convincing portrayal of their characters, and the over all plot was engaging. Now I do need to say that the movie does take liberties in a few places. Like in the movie Peter and Caspian dual in the woods before realizing who each other is. Where in the movie the Pevensies don't meet caspian until the wolf and hag attack Caspian in Aslan's How. But in truth, I like the movie version better!:D So over all, I can honestly say this a wonderful movie worth watching.

Things i don't like : Prince Caspian was a young boy, NOT an adult, they left out Aslan almost entirely until the very end, When Lucy sees Aslan in the book the company Votes, In the movie they just follow what Peter wants to do :(",1334102400,,424,4.170731707317073
1609436,4,B00005JPH2,"Having been a previous fan of the books I was initially disappointed by the changes made to the story. But as with repeated viewings I realized that if you just put the book on film it would have been a VERY boring anticlimactic mess of a film(Nothing against the book, I love it. But books and film are 2 totally different medians) And the story isn't all that changed(No more then the LOTR), yes there are a lot of changes but most of them were for the better or just plain neutral. Scenes like the castle attack were necessary to add something to the middle of the film and it really matures the series, raising the stakes(The Narnians can actually lose!) and making it much for convincing as a real place. I really liked how they portrayed the Telmarines, they were very convincing as a civilization. And the actor for Miraz was amazing!
 There are some changes that I hate such as the Caspian-Susan romance and Peter's spoiled brat attitude, though they make some scenes unpleasent the do not ruin the film for me.

Overall it's not as good of an adaptation as LWW but it's still a great film in it's own right.",1331596800,,1116,4.465686274509804

1609491,2,B00005JPH2,"Really, the title of my review is my review.  The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me.  I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added ""love interest"" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there.  That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian.  sigh.  A very pretty movie though -  I loved the river god - just sadly altered.",1326067200,,652,4.217741935483871
1609492,4,B00005JPH2,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is the second installment in the Narnia series and was filmed in 2008. This time the directors have taken more liberties with the plot and storyline and it is not as faithful to the novel as the first movie. Still the movie is a very nice fantasy movie that has Christian and religious elements to it. Lucy's great faith in Aslan makes her connection to him unique as the others have more doubt. The special effects are great and the music is truly magnificent. A movie to enjoyed by older children as some of the scenes might be a bit scary for wee ones. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.,1326067200,,628,4.517543859649122

1609539,1,B00005JPH2,"I'm doubtful the writers involved in this travesty ever read ""Prince Caspian.""  Or worse, they DID read it and decided they could write it better.  Whatever happened, this film is a derivative work with virtually nothing in common with the novel beyond character names and locations.

I'd love to say I understand why the writers and production teams would take such extreme liberties with the original story line, but the truth is I really don't understand it.  Too much effort is placed on portraying the Pevensie kids as ordinary kids (perhaps to make them more relatable and likeable to child/young adult audience.)  I found this absurd.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are NOT ordinary kids.  They have lived a lifetime as warriors and rulers of an unique fantasyland, grew to adulthood there, and were magically returned to their earthly/childhood forms.  These kids shouldn't be engaging in petty fistfights or rivalries.  Nor should Peter be leading his troops into ill-planned suicide missions.

I found Susan's character more sympathetic but also disjointed.  As lovers of the Narnia series know, Susan is the sibling who ultimately loses faith in Narnia and pulls away from her role there.  ""Prince Caspian"" provides interesting clues and character development as to why Susan might behave this way.  A light, slightly cheesy romance element is thrown in to emphasize this.  However, Susan is also presented as a truly violent character, and I was shocked by this since it went so against the grain of the original story.

Ben Barnes is gorgeous eye candy.  He's a tremendous actor, but you won't see it in this film because his role requires little of him besides looking young, studly, and a bit bewildered most of the time.

Georgie Henley and Skander Keynes had the most remarkable performances in the film, probably because they were the only stars permitted to accurately portray their assigned characters.  Edmund is indeed ""King Edmund the Just"" even if he's still a young teen boy.  Clear thinking and mindful of his conscience.  And Lucy's faith and spiritual confidence based upon her closeness to Aslan is wonderful and terrifying to behold.  Her wordless confrontation of the attacking Telmarines on the bridge is possibly the one thrilling moment in this movie.  The Telmarines clearly don't know who they should fear most:  an army of Narnian creatures behind them or one little girl armed with a small dagger and flanked by an enormous lion in front of them.

It's obvious the producers and writers wanted to strip this film of most of its spiritual symbolism and there was nothing else they could do except wreck the film.  I'm seriously disappointed.  Lovers of the Narnia saga know Narnia is a series of spiritually significant journeys.  Take that away and you've got nothing but generic characters and meaningless events.  And that's just what ""Prince Caspian"" is.

I'm going to view ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" because other reviewers have noted it's better than ""Prince Caspian"" but if it's similar to this film, I doubt this series will complete itself.",1322179200,8,3089,5.037475345167653
1609540,3,B00005JPH2,"I really enjoyed the first film. I feel like this one lost the beauty and magic a little bit.

1609542,4,B00005JPH2,"This is the 2nd installment of the movie adaptations of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  In this, much of our beloved characters have returned along with a few new faces as well.

After being away for awhile, the Pevensie children find themselves being whisked back to Narnia and dumped on to what once was their home.  Realizing that it is hundreds of years later, they wonder why they have been brought back.  When they rescue a dwarf and learn that a Prince is trying to free the Narnians from years of oppression they know they have to help.  But Aslan isn't around to help as much this time, and their foe seems unbeatable.

Characters:
William Moseley: Peter Pevensie
Anna Popplewell: Susan Pevensie
Skandar Keynes: Edmund Pevensie
Georgie Henley: Lucy Pevensie
Ben Barnes: Prince Caspian
Liam Neeson: Aslan

Once again all of the characters were well cast and I was glad the original characters came back for this sequel (and subsequent ones).  The continuity always helps in a series.  Peter was kind of annoying in this movie, but I think he was supposed to have some strife so I guess that explains the motivations. Lucy was still as wonderful as ever and it was amazing to see how Georgie Henley grew up.  I liked the addition of Reepicheep as well as he is always amusing in his daring mousy ways.

This movie mostly stuck close to the book.  There wasn't too much changed anyway.  All the main aspects of the book were included, such as the Uncle's deviousness and Prince Caspian's will to fight for the Narnians.  I do have to complain about the amount of battle scenes in this movie.  Maybe some people enjoy it, but for being an exciting clash of war, I actually got bored with it because it went on so long.  It jus seemed like more was devoted to the battle scenes than to the actual storyline itself.  So much could have been added that wasn't.

The special effects, once again, were tremendous in this movie.  The centaurs and other creatures came to life.  The music too was wonderful as usual.  Still hauntingly beautiful and completely fitting to the tone of Narnia.

It still wasn't a terrible movie.  Quite good when you think about book to movie's that have come before.  If you enjoyed the first, you'll surely enjoy this movie.

1609543,5,B00005JPH2,"This is the 3rd Narnia Movie (4th of the book series) filled with normal great special affects, action and a theme of good vs. evil. Two of the original four children get swept into Narnia with their brat cousin, re-uniting with their ""old"" friend Prince Caspian. The seven ""lords"" who served under the late Prince Caspian's father have all disappeared motivating the kids and Caspian to go searching for them to the ends of the earth.",1316304000,,435,4.7368421052631575

1609545,5,B00005JPH2,"As the previous film of  ""The Chronicles of Narnia""  septalogy,  ""Prince Caspian"" honours the original fantasy novel by Professor C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) with its high standard of acting, cinematography, special effects,  and, of course, a good screen play. As the previous one did, this film grows on the viewer, and, when seen for the first time, although impressive and endearing, it is perhaps not as deeply successful as when seen repeatedly, allowing the viewer to better capture many beautiful details missed before.",1315353600,,523,5.265060240963855

I thought he was just perfect for the part. I've read a lot of criticism about his accent but I think it adds to the fact
of the Pirate references and the differences in cultural background. I love all the Pevensie children----Perfect casting!!!!
I really don't have a favorite but I love the acting of William and Skandar!! I liked everything about this film---the
acting, the story-line,and the characters!!!! I believe this film has been underated and is an excellent watch!!!!
  Like the first Narnia movie this also has great messages that are laid throughout the film!!!!  The first 2 of the Narnia films are my favorite!!! I've watched these over and over and never great tired!!!! P.S. and if you love Ben Barnes---check him out in Dorian Gray! He was great in that too!

1609606,1,B00005JPH2,"I greatly enjoyed this book, but found almost no similarities between it and this movie.  The plot was completely wrong.  Prince Caspian is described as a child in the book.  His uncle speaks to him as though he were a small child, certainly not a young man.  Aslan is very minor in the movie, which takes all the power right out of it.  All the battle scenes are ridiculous.  They changed almost everything important.  The only thing they were on target with is they capture the essence of reepacheep perfectly, but other than that this movie is a huge waste of time, if you love c.s. lewis.  Maybe you would like it if you never read the book.  But honestly the book is much more interesting",1300752000,4,693,4.436507936507937
1609662,3,B00005JPH2,"There's nothing particularly good or bad about PRINCE CASPIAN; it's an all-round average piece of movie-making. I'm not convinced this will keep the kids entertained, and many adults will find themselves staving off the occasional yawn. At least some attempts at humour have been injected into the script, although their success is decidedly patchy. There are also some pretty good set pieces. Not much else to say really, except that the mice are extraordinarily large and there's a dwarf who bears an uncanny resemblance to Martin Amis! Yet another film that fails to do the source material justice. It really only deserves 2.5 stars.",1299369600,,636,5.125

1609664,1,B00005JPH2,"Succintly?  Too much Lord of the Rings, not enough Chronicles of Narnia.

Events in the book are not really rendered faithfully, but used more as a barebones plot to make a straightforward ""Return of the King""-esque action showdown, and much of the charm that made the book an interesting read is ditched for simplistic Hollywood-style action.

It's as if all the uniqueness and charm of the original is traded for a formulaic Hollywood plot that values cuteness over charm.  Watching the 3 stage battle/siege at the end with 3 types of deus ex machina made me wonder if I wasn't actually watching ""Return of the King"" again.

I think after awhile all fantasy action-movies with walking trees and CGI creatures start to look the same.  And pretty much all the lame Hollywood jokes and romance angles are the same too.  And who, reading the original book, would have imagined Prince Caspian as looking like a young Antonio Banderas?  Or Peter as a Justin Bieber?

Filmmakers making a movie of a classic children's book like this should really stay true to the original - not try to shape it into something they think is going to sell more tickets.  Even if the big CGI battle scenes and one-liners do sell more tickets, you're still left with a mediocre movie.",1298592000,6,1259,4.73394495412844

Those, who are familiar with the first movie (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe) will appreciate this movie even more than the first.  While the first movie took a while to get started, this movie takes off and never stops.  This movie is suitable for all ages, though some of the younger children may not understand the story completely, though this movie enraptures and charms one's soul to the extent that other movies fail.",1298073600,,569,4.549019607843137
1609666,4,B00005JPH2,"In 'Prince Caspian' we return to an altered and savage Narnia and more fantasy adventure to delight the family. You get great affects, battle scenes, talking animals and a pretty close rendition of the book. I have to say that I found this more enjoyable than 'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' with the slightly darker elements to the story fitting the fantasy adventure theme a lot better. The children stars of this film annoy me as actors and Prince Caspians accent reminded me of Puss in Boots from Shrek at times, but overall the acting was OK and didn't detract from the story. It manages to achieve what it set out to, that is, a fun family adventure and manages to keep you interested and watching for the duration, which didn't feel overly long as the story kept pushing forward. A good film that is worth watching if you were a fan of the first installment or of fantasy films in general.

One of the very creative ideas used were the accents of the creatures and people.  The Centaurs with Carribean accents, the Telmarines with Spanish.  It made it really feel like another world.

However, after watching it again (I bought this and The L,W&W so my children could see them before watching Dawn Treader at the theater) my opinion has changed. I greatly enjoyed this film, even with the differences from the book. (The differences from the books in each of the movies, including Dawn Treader, might disappoint faithful fans of C.S.

1609712,4,B00005JPH2,"This second installment of the Narnia Chronicles is much better than The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe film.

The film begins with the birth of a son. Cousin to Prince Caspian. Caspian must now flee his home or else be killed by his evil uncle. It has to do with heirs and wanting to rule the people.

As he escapes into the woods, he blows a horn. This horn he was instructed to blow whenever he was in serious trouble. It also happens to belong to Susan. The oldest sister. This action by Caspian causes the siblings to transport back to Narnia.

But it's been 1300 years since they've left after the first movie. Narnia has changed. Many of the animals no longer speak and humans now rule the land.

Of course, Caspian and the Pevensie kids team up with a few magical beasts to fight Caspian's uncle and his forces.

I don't want to get too much into because I think you'd want to see it for yourself. It's action packed, a couple battle scenes that take up a large section of run-time along with a couple jump-in-your-seat moments.

I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. It was almost perfect!",1294099200,,1099,4.362745098039215

1609714,2,B00005JPH2,"The movie captures the look and feel of Narnia and many scenes are beautifully blocked and filmed. However, the movie's creators tampered too much with the actual story. This is a flaw not because they ""should"" or ""must"" copy the books exactly;we all recognize that some creativity may be required to retell a book's story as a smashingly good movie. This, they failed to do. The ridiculous attempt at a love story between Susan and the Prince was embarassing. And turning Miraz the usurper into the first acceptor of the new land was totally unnecessary and ineffective. News flash: There is a reason these stories have stood the test of time and been read and re-read by children and adults, generation after generation-- they are good stories!

1609715,2,B00005JPH2,"Others here report well on the serious problems with this movie's production: deviations from Lewis' original plot, fabrication of non-existent scenes, and corruption of the characters' motives and personalities. You should also be aware that Disney has disabled the BD-Live content with no explanation or recourse, other than returning the disc.  Yet Disney continues to advertise the BD-Live features on its site.

The problem is that all the BD-Live features require registering an account on the Disney site, but Disney has deliberately removed the registration process, effectively locking out anyone not already registered. This constitutes false advertising, in my opinion, but Disney refuses to either correct its advertising or restore registration.

I both emailed and called Disney, and they acknowledge the problem but refuse to restore access.  Here is the email response I received:

  ""With the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney BD-Live Network has undergone several changes.  With these changes, there is no longer an option to register for the BD-Live Network. The features on future Blu-ray titles will not require registration. Past Blu-ray titles will be changing with future updates to eliminate registration enabled features. You will still be able to access the BD-Live Network as a guest if the registration is not completed. If you have any further questions, please call us at 1-800-723-4763, Mondays 9:30-7:30 and Tuesday through Friday 9:30-6:30 CST for assistance.""

Disney's statement ""You will still be able to access the BD-Live Network as a guest if the registration is not completed"" is disingenuous:  it applies only to FUTURE titles, not this one or others of its vintage, according to the Disney rep I spoke with. You're completely locked out of BD-Live on the Prince Caspian Narnia BD (and all BDs prior to Snow White).

I asked Disney how anyone can trust them not to renege on its BD-Live content promises again on the latest titles. They had no answer. Why Disney is cheating its customers is a mystery. It can't possibly cost anything significant  to maintain a registration process.

1609717,1,B00005JPH2,"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.",1285891200,12,1369,4.682008368200837

It's been a year since we last saw the four Pevensie children, the Battle of Britain is over, and London is safe enough for them to go back there--or at least to pass through on their way to boarding school.  But Peter (William Moseley), in particular, finds it difficult to forget that he was a High King in Narnia for 15 years or so.  Then unknown magic draws them back to the land they once ruled--only to find that centuries have passed there, their castle of Caer Paravel is a forgotten ruin, and Narnia has been conquered by the neighboring Telmarines, who have succeeded in driving the Old Narnains--dwarves, fauns, talking animals, centaurs, and the rest--into hiding.  The sole hope they have for freedom is the young prince, Caspian (Ben Barnes), whose uncle and guardian, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), has recently ordered him killed upon fathering a son of his own and seizing the throne.  Caspian, it turns out, has summoned the Pevensies back by means of Susan's (Anna Popplewell) ivory horn--and is a bit disappointed to find out that they're only children.  But Narnia's magic is working on them already, and they may be a greater help to him than anyone knows.

Once again, if you've read the book, you know what to expect in the way of plot.  The story might have benefited from giving us all the background on Caspian and his tutor, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), who was largely responsible for teaching him the true history of Narnia and inspiring him to want to rule it properly.  But it's definitely improved by a non-canonical attempt on the part of the Old Narnian army to seize Miraz's castle in the dark of night and make him a prisoner (watch for the gryphons being used, as they were in the first film, as a Narnian airborne auxiliary--almost certainly something Peter or Edmund (Skandar Keynes) thought of), and by a hint of attraction between Caspian and Susan.  Castellitto is a wonderful villain with a touch of the exotic, and, of course, the effects are dazzling, especially the battle scenes and the Old Narnians (Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), the swashbuckling Talking Mouse, is an utter delight, and be sure to keep your eye open for the very young, and very proud, centaur colt who's part of the triumphal arch of swords with which they salute the four returned Kings and Queens).  Liam Neeson returns as the excellent voice of Aslan.  Though perhaps more savage and violent than the book, it's also much more exciting and faster-paced.

1609766,5,B00005JPH2,"Where The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was more of a carbon copy of the book it was based on, Prince Caspian carries over most of the Christian themes central to the story, but makes it it's own and fresh for those that already know the book well and aren't necessarily looking for a verbatim regurgitation of what they've already read.

Not surprisingly, we bookworms rarely seem to fully appreciate movies based on the books we know and love because the film fails to subscribe as precisely to the book as we would like; and if it does, it's chosen tone often still doesn't align with our own perceptions of what we read.  As an avid reader and moviegoer, I know this feeling all to well, but I also feel that thinking that way only takes away from the enjoyment and personal growth that can come from a new, fresh translation.

I'll use the classic story of a sleepy valley near Tarry Town NY to illustrate my point.  As much as I loved Tim Burton's dark reimagining of Washington Irvings legendary tale, because of it, I now have a rule never to read books that are based on a movie, instead of the other way around.  Reading ""Sleepy Hollow"" the book translation was essentially like reading the movie; the book neither embellished on the movies script, nor tried to translate the films visual design, which was a huge part of the appeal, if not more intriguing than the story itself.  Neither have the many cartoons that attempt to translate Washington Irving's classic novella ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", merited a second look.  They're fine for introducing new generations to the classic tale, but don't offer enough that is new to favor over re-reading the novella.  But Burton's Sleepy Hollow and Irving's classic novella are as dissimilar as their respective mediums. And thus can be repeatedly enjoyed individually, even one right after the other, without getting bored by watching something you just read or reading something you just saw.  Both, bring enough uniqueness to the table, that for a fan of either, it would still be worthwhile to check out the other.

The same is true of Caspian.  The beloved characters and age-old premise are still there, but in addition for fans of the story to being able to actually see this fantasy world brilliantly brought to life by the pinacle of cinematic technology and an uncompromising budget, we get a fresh story that's more than just nuances in personal perception, like the first film essentially was in ways it differed fome the book.

The movie is still faithful to CS Lewis's Christain allegories.  Though some side messages may have been compromised, if anything, the major ones have been magnified by changes that more appropriately compliment the cinematic medium.  Thanks to this film, we can enjoy a fresh perspective and telling on CS Lewis's heavenly inspired story from both mediums.  The movie honors both his work and God's message, dare I say even bettering it in the visual and sonic ways that only the best cinema can, but at least no less profound or worthwhile than what Lewis wrote over six decades ago in late 1949.

I also enjoyed Disney's BD immensely.  The picture and sound were as capably preserved as I had hoped they would be, even when projecting onto an unforgiving 100"" screen.",1267920000,,3276,4.769911504424779

1609769,2,B00005JPH2,"Having read the books more times than I can count, I, like many others, was initially disappointed with the first film in the series (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe), as it didn't line up with the way I had been envisioning the story and the characters for the last 20 years or so since I first read them.  After seeing it once or twice more, however, I came to the conclusion that the first film was actually quite good- mostly because, I suppose, it was respectful of the source material.  Almost nothing was left out from the book, and the sequences that were added and 'actioned-up' such as the battle scene, were done so in a way that did not detract from the story, nor did they lose sight of the fact that it is a childrens' movie based on a childrens' book.  The innocence and simplicity of the stories are one of the things that make them great, after all.
This brings us to 'Prince Caspian'; a violent, grim monster of a movie with little to recommend it.  To begin with, the characters of Peter and Susan have been altered fairly drastically from the book, turning Peter into a sullen bully and Susan into a brainy snob.  To paraphrase the next book in the series (Voyage of the Dawn Treader) Susan is 'no good at school, though very grown-up in other ways'. And the Peter of the film deserves none of the respect due a High King, since he's a whiny brat who clearly can't handle the authority that has been bestowed on him by Aslan.  And speaking of Aslan, where was he in this film?  There's hardly a sight or mention of him other than from Lucy.  The story is altered as such so that when Aslan says, ""Nothing ever happens the same way twice"" the story is resolved exactly in the manner of the first film.  Sloppy writing and pacing abounds.  Whereas the crux of the book is seeking Aslan's direction and following him regardless of whether he can be seen of heard (yes, it is a fairly strong Christian allegory, and I can respect that some people may not be comfortable with it, but it IS a story, and if the filmmakers were not comfortable with it, they should not have undertaken this project).  In one of the books, Lucy says to Aslan, ""Its not Narnia, you know.  It's YOU.""  Although often not seen directly, the presence of Aslan is central to the books.  In the film, he is set aside and only let out at the end as a way of resolving an otherwise unresolveable story.  There are plenty of other things to complain about, such a the age of Caspian (he's supposed to be a 'boy king', young enough indeed to still have a Nurse who looks after him, instead played by a very pretty 20-something Ben Barnes, who, all things considered doesn't do a bad job at it.  He just looks a little too much like Orlando Bloom), the presence of minotaurs and other 'bad guys' in Caspian's army (the moral clarity of the books is another of their strong points- again a somewhat uncomfortable idea for some, but that's the way that Lewis wrote them.  There are plenty of other films based on young adult books that are a lot more morally relative), and some other things, but the biggest problem is the excess of violence.
In the first film, there is a big battle scene, but it is not long, and is clearly a struggle between good and evil.  It is, in essence, a fantasy battle.  The long, drawn-out violence of 'Prince Caspian', which is brief and only alluded to in the book (where instead, Aslan leads an army of Narnians to free the Telmarines mentally and spiritually from the oppression that has been placed on them.  It doesn't sound exciting, but read the book- it is), is much more complex; the Narnians (the 'good' guys) are fighting an army of humans (called 'Telmarines') who are doing battle at the behest of their leader, King Miraz.  Now, these people are Caspian's rightful subjects- he is their lawful king.  It complicates thing when there is over an hour of war footage where the Narnians slaughter hundreds, maybe thousands of the people they are trying to free from oppression.  While Miraz is certainly a villain, his men aren't neccessarily so, and yet we watch as they are mauled by the dozen by Caspian & co.  Do the Narnians have a choice?  In the real world, no.  They are justifiably defending themselves.  But this is a film, and the writers of the film clearly hadn't thought this through.  Would Aslan, who has the power to end this conflict at any time (which he does anyway), allow this sort of massacre to take place so that his choice for king can take power?  Likewise, would the Telmarines accept Caspian as their king and liberator after he and his army of non-humans have killed hundreds of their friends, brothers, husbands and sons?  In the book, Miraz, the true villain, is fought and killed, but the Telmarines, whose minds and spirits have been held captive by him, are instead given freedom and purpose, not death and destruction.  It seems that the filmakers felt that no one would accept a fantasy film without a massive CGI-driven battle scene, and so they forced as much of it in as they could, even writing a whole new sequence (the 'castle raid', which was not in the book at all) to increase the body count.  At the end of the film I didn't feel victorious, joyful or elated, as I did after the first film, and certainly after reading any of the books.  To the point, I felt better after watching 'Platoon' and 'Saving Private Ryan' than I did after watching the hollow victory of Caspian at such a high cost.  And the last straw was watching Susan groping Prince Caspian in a 'romantic' moment where the romance wasn't even hinted at earlier in the film and was very uncomfortable (Susan is supposed to be 13 or 14 in this story and looks a few years older, while Caspian is obviously a lot older and looks 25 and that looks like statutory rape in the works).  Again, we can't have a movie without kissing, can we?
There are a few positive parts of the film, mainly the performance of Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley as Edmund and Lucy, both very young actors of impressive ability who do bring a little magic back to Narnia.  Overall, however, it seems that everyone else forgot this was supposed to be a childrens' film, made for children, based on a childrens' book.  The magic, innocence and simplicity are supposed to be a part of it, and in fact, are what makes these stories quite a bit deeper than most childrens' books. That is why even adults read these books over and over, and that is why this film was a nearly complete failure.",1266710400,5,6503,4.480508474576271

A-ha! The film diverges so vastly from the book that what we are left with is yet another example of why Hollywood has struggled so much in recent years to make big budget, quality, substantial movies. They have a tendency to sacrifice heart and substance for flash and marketing appeal.

Now I know film versions of books have to take some liberties, even with relatively short books like Prince Caspian, in order to try and come in around two- to two-and-a-half hours in length. That usually means sacrificing some character development.

But what we have here is character RE-development. They changed the characters of almost all the main players, one suspects, because some executives focus-grouped it and decided to make it more appealing to the teen market. (The irony of 40-50 year old executives sitting around deciding what teens want or don't want is amusing.)

I won't list out all the vast changes this film made with the book; other reviewers here have done an admirable job with that already. But I will say that in just about every serious deviation the filmmakers took away from the book, it was a step in the wrong direction. What we are left with is a rather hollow stringing together of fantasy/action/romance elements, many of which were simply the invention of the filmmakers and had nothing to do with Lewis' book. Let's hope they do better with the next Narnia film.",1266364800,,1662,4.681506849315069
1609792,3,B00005JPH2,"But the thing that had me checking out emotionally was the assault on the castle about midway through the movie.  I just wasn't buying that the army of beasts and birds would have been repulsed:

1.  The main army was supposed to have been bivouacked somewhere, leaving the castle thinly defended.
2.  Element of surprise intact:  the castle defenders were supposed to be sleeping, yet here here they all were suited up lickety-split in chain mail!
3.  The soldiers would have been freaked out seeing centaurs and talking mice.
4.  The gryphons should have been lending some formidable assist, yet after depositing their cargo, they pretty much disappeared.
5.  A key commander, Prince Caspian, knew the castle grounds intimately and would have been able to brief his troops superbly.

1609794,1,B00005JPH2,"I had high hopes for this movie after thoroughly enjoying The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Although LWW does deviate from the book in some ways, (in spite of the casting for the voice of Aslan and the Witch), it stays true to the spirit and the overall plot line of the book. I think the battle is awesome, and the four Pevensies are played very well and spiritedly. My dad took my sister and me to see Prince Caspian in the theatre, and, although I had already heard about the kiss, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Now, don't stop reading. We were given the movie before it came out on DVD in the U.S. and our whole family watched it, and liked it. Then we watched it again. By that time, I was beginning to realize that it wasn't as great as I had thought (in part due to my brother, who pointed some things out). But I still liked it. Then I watched it again, and I totally disliked it that time. Here are my quarrels with it:
***WARNING: SPOILERS***
It begins with Caspian being awoken by Dr. Cornelius (whom I do not think is ever named except by the title 'Professor' or 'Doctor') and he is helped to escape.
He gets out of the castle and is chased by Telmarine soldiers; this is not in the book, where Caspian's escape, besides happening later on, is done in secrecy and is not found out for a day or two. Why do we care about Caspian? Just some guy with a Spanish accent (where'd they come up with that? Why couldn't they be descended from English pirates just as easily?)who is, for some reason, running away because his uncle, for some reason, wants to kill him.
Dear me, I'm already getting long winded, and we've hardly begun. I'll try to keep it short. Okay, then we go to the Pevensies, who are at a huge train station (very unlike Lewis's 'empty, sleepy country railway station') and the first thing we know, Susan (who has a bad attitude) has lied to a boy about her name, and Peter has gotten into a fight. Then they are pulled dramatically into Narnia, and arrive on the seashore.
The movie goes very quickly on to them finding their old castle, now in ruins, and then rescuing a dwarf from drowning. In the book, Susan merely shoots the soldier's helmet, and, being superstitious, he and his companion jump out and swim to shore. In the movie, she actually shoots the man! Dead! So much for 'Queen Susan the Gentle', and we're hardly twenty minutes into the film.
The dwarf turns out to be an idiotic, sour, ugly, bratty thing called Trumpkin, very unlike the lovable dwarf from the books. He is not a good actor, if you ask me, but maybe it's just his script. All he does is get on my nerves through the whole movie. So, after a neat swordfight between him and Edmund, they go off to find Caspian. Meanwhile, Caspian has escaped from the soldiers for a moment, banged his head on a tree limb, and finds himself at the doorway of a small cave. Two dwarfs rush out to kill him, and he, for no apparent reason, blows the horn that Cornelius gave him, despite the fact that it was supposed to be blown at a completely different time, and for completely different reasons (there are, apparently, no reasons at all in the movie for this action).
Trumpkin runs out as the Telmarines find them, and Caspian is knocked out by Nikabrik. Since I haven't watched this in a while, I can't remember when exactly all the cutting between the Pevensies and Caspian is, so I'll do my best.
The Pevensies row down the river, then get out and go on foot. We find out that Trumpkin has been captured by Miraz' men, and he stands before Miraz and the council. We find Caspian in the cave; he wakes up and hears the badger and Nikabrik talking about him. The badger is there completely for comic relief. In the book he's a noble animal, who is very loyal to Caspian. Here, he's a slapstick.
Nikabrik is extremely ugly (do dwarves have to be that ugly? In the old BBC Narnia movies, they looked perfectly fine without being made to look so extremely ugly), and bitter. Caspian convinces them that he is not going to harm them, and they go off into the forest, where they are found by Telmarine soldiers and shot at.
Trufflehunter is hit, and Caspian does a very brave (and somewhat out of movie! character) action, and goes back and picks up the badger. The Telmarines are still shooting at him, but suddenly they begin to fall down. Of course, it's Reepicheep, and after he's finished off the soldiers, he knocks Caspian down and is about to kill him, but the badger intervenes.
Then there's a really dumb place where he's at the Dancing Lawn, a very dark, horrid looking place, if you ask me, with a bunch of centaurs and animals pointing at him and shouting. Caspian calms them down and gives a stupid, politician like speech, full of the required, cheesy sounding promises, that he will give them back their land if they will help him become king.
You don't get the sense that he loves Old Narnia, merely that he wants to be king and get even with Miraz. It seems that he didn't even believe in them until he met the badger and dwarf (compare to the book, where 'thinking and dreaming about the old days, and longing that they might come back, filled nearly all his spare hours').

So, after that, obviously they decide to help him. We go back to Peter and Co., who are confronted with a high cliff that they nearly fall off of, and Lucy sees Aslan. I can't remember if Edmund believes her, I think he does, but the rest do not, and they go on. Lucy has a dream about Aslan coming to her, and then next day, after deciding that maybe she was right (they can't go the way they wanted because the Telmarines are there), they go back and Lucy finds the way down into the ravine. Aslan is conspicuously absent to those of us who know and love the story. He was supposed to show them the way down, and guide them down.
Then they meet Caspian (whom Susan and Lucy aren't supposed to meet till the end), and immediately Susan is looking admiringly at the prince. They go on with him, and from there the story plunges straight downhill:

The disastrous raid on the castle, Peter's horrible attitude, Caspian's horrible attitude, Susan's extremely out of character fighting (and screaming to the other archers), the long, drawn out Lord of the Ring's-esque battle, oh, I could go on and on. I can't stand that Peter is immature, right up to the end, where he gives Caspian his sword, with a 'You don't need us anymore', and then they leave. Edmund and Lucy were the only ones who seemed to be in character most of the time, but even they didn't redeem the movie, so I give it one star.",1264118400,9,6589,4.4

Technically, as a piece of cinematography, the latter stands as a marked improvement over Andrew Adamson's first Narnia film. Better acting, better special effects, even better soundtrack. The plot also has more twists and turns, from the raid on the castle to the internecine fighting among the Telmarines.

The Pevensie kids feel more comfortable with their roles, raising the level of acting up a notch. Between his accent and youthful demeanor, Ben Barnes has the right mix of prince and adventurer to fill the role of Prince Caspian. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Trumpkin is a great addition, injecting sarcasm and cynicism into the dialogue. Even the minotaurs seem like better actors. When the rest of the army flees the enemy castle, a minotaur holds the gate open.

Some of the animal computer-generated characters look cartoonish, especially the wolves, although Aslan the lion himself looks great. Overall, these are a few details that, with a bit more work, could have been improved.

Technically, as a piece of cinematography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-Prince-Caspian/dp/B00005JPH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a>&nbsp;stands as a marked improvement. The Pevensies are back, with the addition of Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian. Between his accent and youthful demeanor, Barnes has the right mix of prince and adventurer to fill the role. The Telmarines make great villains, as the byzantine tribe of human invaders in the land of Narnia. The Telmarines display a vile mix of treachery and hatred that minotaur costumes and CG wolves just can't match. The effects and soundtrack are also much better.

I don't think it's a big deal, but I will mention that there is some blood in this movie. Not a lot by any means, and not enough to probably give it a second thought, but certain things gave this movie a more mature feel to it. The movie itself starts off slow, and slowly progresses, but once the first major fight scene comes up it barely falls off much.

The Lion returns in this effort which by the time half of the movie was over, I was surprised to see, and the Witch from the first one also makes a small return.

If you are worried if this is going to be too violent for a kid, I'd say overall it's not. The 1-3 year olds won't sit and watch it that much and the older ones, say 8 and up will find it engulfing and magical as I did. Sure, there is a done-that-been-there feel to it since the movie's first incarnation but Narnia: Prince Caspian is sure to please loyal fans and new fans alike.

The ones I'd worry about watching it is probably the more impressionable 4-6 year olds. It may be a bit too intense for them but overall, anyone can view this movie and take something from it.

Many have said that this wasn't as good as the first, but in contrast, I must disagree. This one had a special flair to me. Both movies may be a bit on the long side, but I enjoyed them to a good degree, especially when the first introduced itself in 2006 and I went to the theatre to see it.

Those who have read C.S. Lewis's gentle parables may be jarred by the shift in atmosphere.  This is a dark, grim, and scary film, which didn't bother me but may give some parents pause.  I enjoyed the scenes of court intrigue among the nobles of Telmarine, but children would probably be bored.  There are some very lengthy and violent battle scenes that were glossed over in the novel but take up the lion's share of screen time here.

While these other movies might not have contained all the dialog or details, there certainly was not entirely new scenes or story-lines made up as in Prince Caspian. The battle at Prince Caspian's uncle's castle doesn't even exist in the book. The book might be considered a ""coming of age"" story about Prince Caspian having to grow up into a king - his character in the movie seemed too old and did not reflect well the ""coming of age"" idea.  Adding the love interest between Susan and Prince Caspian was also unnecessary - why couldn't Disney leave the writing to C.S. Lewis instead of making up their own Hollywood twist on it?  We took our young daughter, who has been read all the books first, to see the movie at the theater and just hope the rest of the movies aren't this bad.",1250380800,,988,4.417582417582418

Epic battles, living trees, and much more are pulled directly from what we saw only a few years ago under Peter Jackson's able hands. And although THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN has a few ""moments"" of its own, it fails to entertain anywhere near the first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe/dp/B000YAFJXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>.

This is mostly due to the fact that we are rushed into battle scene after battle scene with little time to look at (and feel for) the characters. This is painfully obvious when we get 7/8 of the way through the film and still haven't seen Aslan but have been in so many fights that they begin to meld together. The Lord of the Rings never had this problem because the focus was kept tight on the characters, particularly the Hobbits. Which brings me to a positive point about Prince Caspian: the development of the friendship between Lucy (Georgie Henley, returning from the first Chronicles film) with that of the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-at-a-Funeral/dp/B001O2MBP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death at a Funeral</a>). Although lightly touched on by comparisons with, say, Samwise and Frodo, the connection between dwarf and young queen was powerful enough to make me care a bit about what happened to them.

The downsides, however, are just too numerous. The almost bratty nature of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stardust/dp/B000WZAE1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stardust</a>) made the main character seem petulant rather than regal. And his continued arrogance toward Peter (William Moseley) was completely out of context with C.S. Lewis' novels. The repetitive battle scenes lead nowhere, and when Narnians die, we really don't feel any remorse for them as the viewer.

That said, there's plenty of eye-candy in terms of CGI. It's everywhere. And it's almost too pervasive. But it is used well ...albeit often.

The big question many may be asking is: ""Should I watch it?"" And the answer is a definite ""yes."" Although it's horribly flawed, it's worth watching for Lucy and Trumpkin, as well as the funny antics of Pattertwig the Squirrel and his deadly sword. And you'll need to be up on the film for the final release due out some time in the near future: THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER.

The only thing I would really complain about is the use of cliches (overused plot ideas). The evil uncle kills his brother and tries to kill his nephew. Does that sound familiar? It does to me -- The Lion King and the movie version of Ella Enchanted use the exact same theme. If you want something original, you might want to check out something else.

1609930,3,B00005JPH2,"If you are reading reviews to learn about the DVD itself, then know that this is a nicely put together piece. Though the digital copy is kind of pointless in my view, the special features on this DVD set are very good; As with the Lion/Witch/Wardrobe special dvd, the features on this one fall somewhere in between those of the Lord of the Rings (the best), and Harry Potter series (pretty pathetic). If you are interested in behind the scenes stuff, this DVD is well worth the extra cost.

However, if you were wondering about the film itself, I'm afraid Caspian falls well short of expectations. Much of the imagination of the first film is lost as the director Andrew Adamson tries to make the film more 'mature'. Actually, he never truly committed to this, with his goofy approach to Reepicheep often ruining serious and otherwise believable moments in the film. In addition to his heavy use of goofy humor vis a vis the mouse, his notion that adding a forced 'romance' between two characters made the film more adult is, I think, ridiculous. To continue with the theme of invented plot lines not found in the book, Adamson gets it completely wrong with his foolish 'castle raid' sequence and the invented tension between Caspian and Peter. Instead of adding legitimate weight to the movie, it soils the characters from the books, and it just feels false and put on.

All in all, Caspian is an enjoyable film, but the direction Adamson takes it in ruins the potential for this film. I view Caspian as the best Narnia book, and the most suited to a real action film. That is the reason for my disappointment, not that it is a bad film. I am looking forward to a fresh vision for Dawn Treader.",1245801600,4,1695,4.590759075907591

With that said, I'm highly aware of the differences between the book and the movie. It's difficult to translate dancing trees, mythical Bacchus, and children released from stuffy institutions as a reawaking and renewed freedom of Narnia that only words and the power of imagination can explain. Winning a battle tells much more on a screen.

The liberties taken to change the story for cinema worked well for visual presentation. Reality (at a PG level) was thrust into fantasy as the protagonist children struggle to save what they learned to love in Narnia while dealing with their own emotional conflicts rooted at home. I didn't care for the love interests between Susan and Caspian, but these film snippets will be a venue to explain Susan's character change of heart that happens rather abruptly in another book - and hopefully will come to film.

Prince Caspian is a delightful, exciting tale, but it's not a rock-em-sock-em rollercoaser ride. Enjoy it for what it is - the retelling (and best to date) of the continuing children's adventure in Narnia.",1245628800,,1171,4.845

A place that will appear just as bland and ordniary everywhere else. It it now up to the Pevense children to return an rescue Narnia from this new menace and discover the true king of Narnia, Prince Caspain.

I was very surprised by this film. Much like the first Narnia film it was not an incredible movie, but it was just as enjoyable and the atmosphere was a little more dramatic and mature. There is a lot of dramatic sword fights and meaningful moments between the characters and the new roles are played well by actors such as Eddie Izzard and Ben Barnes.

1609949,2,B00005JPH2,"The only thing I have to say is: Why Disney!? WHY? The movie relies too much on heavy action sequences rather then the characters personalities and the actual plot.  What with the many added scenes that don't really help the plot and the changes of the characters that are not in the actual book.  For example: Peter and Caspian get along in the book but in the movie they are constantly bickering and fighting about the most random stuff.  Almost the whole movie is just of action sequences and a bunch of teens constantly fighting each other.  The high kings and queens are supposed to act like kings and queens rather than a bunch of whiney kids who have nothing better to do then complain about each others actions.
Also the whole Caspian/Susan romance thing was totally uncalled for and it angered a whole lot of Narnia fans.  Disney made a very bad attempt to add soo much stuff in that wasn't in the book that it just seems that the Prince Caspian movie is only related to the book by name.  Not to mention that the whole ""Night raid"" thing was only added in so that Disney could appeal to the eyes of perverted teens who enjoy seeing talking animal-freaks being stabbed to death.
Ben Barnes did an adequate job as Caspian but he didn't really ""WOW!"" me.  In fact most of the actors seemed the same.  They all were whiney complainers who would rather argue then do anything.  Also Caspian doesn't really act like a king and Disney definitely did some major character changes(age, looks, goofy accent).
There is countless things that the movie could have left out.  The countless action sequences that aren't in the book could have been censored down or limited to only three main battles. That whole thick accent thingy was too funny to take seriously.

1609955,4,B00005JPH2,"I am giving this 4 stars because it is not as compelling as the first, though the special effects are certainly better and the scenery is New Zealand at its most gorgeous.

But there just wasn't the same sense of how much was at stake, perhaps because the children were not really that differentiated and had to share the lead with Caspian, and the conflict wasn't on a one to one level as it was with the White Witch, Aslan, and Peter.

She makes a brief appearance, great stuff, then poof, gone, leaving us with only Caspian's ambitious uncle.

It is true, there is less magic in this film, but that is because they have been spending centuries trying to stamp it out by making Narnia and its inhabitants extinct. Still, Aslan gets so little screen time it is almost a let down--I mean, where WAS he. And the trees section is straight out of LOTR II.

I did enjoy the battle scenes but there was a fair amount of violence and depictions of wounds.

One final point, some of the scenes like the opening giving birth are not quite what one would expect for a Disney 'kids' film.",1241740800,2,1078,4.396984924623116

It's peculiar to see a sword wielding mouse make a wise crack/joke right before he kills a man by stabbing him through the eye (I'm assuming this as you don't actually see it, but it's obvious).  Also, it's one thing to have imaginary creatures fight/kill each other, but having an outright war where humans are being killed is unsettling.

And the fighting is throughout the ENTIRE movie.  The first movie led up to the confrontation at the end and was relatively short.  But Prince Caspian was all confrontation from beginning to end.  I still enjoyed the movie since I like action and war movies, but it certainly changed the tone of the Narnia series and I doubt I would let my young kids watch it.",1240876800,4,820,4.537414965986395

The storyline is pretty close to the book, and what was added only made the movie better. The night raid, for instance, is one of the highest points of the film.

1610016,4,B00005JPH2,"Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian was another solid movie in the Narnia series.  The same favorite characters are intertwined in another excellent story that takes place only 1 year in real world time and hundreds of years in Narnian time from the Lion, Witch and Wardrode.  The epic takes us on a journey where Narnia is completely different than it once was.  Now it is essentially a world in the Middle Ages with conflict rising because of the lack of leadership in Narnia.

The journey is very different from the first which is great because it is a completely new world that we haven't seen.  It is not like Lord of the Rings where it is simply a continuation of the story.  Aslan does not show up nearly as often as the children battle each other on whether or not Aslan has left them to take care of everything on their own.

It is another great adventure and well worth the time spent watching.",1238544000,,904,4.475609756097561

1610030,5,B00005JPH2,"I am a confirmed C.S. Lewis fan. Everyone at school knew this as I could frequently be seen toting his books around. So much so that for my final art project, painting a ceiling tile that represented a part of us that people knew from high school, I did a Narnian landscape. I saw this movie three times in theatres and rented it the day it came out even though I knew I would get it for Christmas in just in couple weeks.
The movie and the book are SIMILIAR not the same. If you are a person who truly insists on book to screen purity this movie would disappoint. But for clarity and timesake the book wouldn't translate to the screen as well. Plus the film explores some interesting concepts with charactor development.
In the book you start off in England, then go to Narnia where Trumpkin tells the events of the past few weeks (and centuries) to the children. In the book this works well but it just doesn't translate to a screen, where flashbacks are a way to reveal something important, not a way to start a story than come back and go forth.
However, it appears that the raid on the castle is the problem most people have concerning the adaptation. There is no such raid in the book. Not even anything close. But after introducing the Pevensies in LWW it would hardly seem right that they spend the first half of the movie listening to Trumpkin talk and taking a hike. Whereas exploring the Narian landscape and its changes in a book is exciting such a thing does not translate well on screen. Your imagination has less room to run.
Peter's personality is altered for the movie, but let's face it the books are more concerned with situation than charactor, at least where Peter and Susan are concerned. Peter is flat. He is just a perfect thereness in the novel. So I was very impressed with his charactor development in the movie. It is valid to wonder how a high king would feel had he been stuck back in school as a relative nobody.
This is not to say the movie has no flaws. Lucy comes off a little too perfect. Peter cannot lead a charge without shouting something 'inspiring' and Susan has a bottomless quiver of arrows (These both come off as laughable). And there is a 'romance' between Susan and Prince Caspian (which is annoying but ignorable).
I do feel it should be noted that this is not a movie for people to take young children to. There is quite alot of violence.
I felt this movie was marvalously handled and cannot wait to see the next one which I feel will make a fun movie that is much more light-hearted.",1238025600,,2533,4.414529914529915
1610031,4,B00005JPH2,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie ""Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the witch and the Wardrobe"".

1610034,2,B00005JPH2,"The movie had good visuals and plenty of action, and had the potential for good storylines and character development - but fell short, in my view, of reaching its full potential due to an overall lack of clarity and coherence. Early on, for example, the kids were unexpectedly thrust into Narnia, but they didn't seem overly perplexed as to why this had happened. Another example occurred in subsequent scenes, when there was some confusion over who the central character was intended to be in the movie - Peter or Caspian. This point was still somewhat muddled at the end.

Overall, because this movie is part of the Narnia series, it is expected to have a moral to the story. Unfortunately, the particular meaning of this movie was not as clear as it might have been. The moral, presumably, was that the characters should have sought out the lion, Aslan, right from the start, rather than trying to proceed on their own wisdom and strength. The movie could have punctuated that point better throughout the movie, in my view, and especially at the end. Although the ending is satisfying, the moral point could easily be lost on viewers.

Also, the movie was rather violent - not gory, but filled with suggestions of serious violence throughout. For this reason, it's not clear that the movie is highly recommended for children. All in all, the movie is pretty good for a couple of hours of entertainment, and had good potential, but it was not as good as it could have been.",1237680000,,1475,4.713178294573644
1610035,4,B00005JPH2,"This the darker, more world-weary follow-up to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', wherein four English schoolchildren go through a mysterious old wardrobe and emerge into a wondrous enchanted land of talking animals, dancing trees, a wicked  ice-witch and the noble lion Aslan. Peter and Edmund, Susan and Lucy Pevensie ruled as kings and queens of this place, after defeating the winter witch. They ruled wisely and with success and happiness, growing into adulthood ... before abruptly returned to their prosaic real lives, as children, in World War II era Britain.  It is now a year later - and the older children have begun adjusting unhappily to the reality they were returned to. Without apparent warning, however, they are restored to Narnia - going from a dark and grimy subway platform in wartime Britain, to a sea-cave leading out to glorious sunlit seashore. Almost at once, it becomes clear that this is Narnia a thousand years later. The castle from which they governed is in ruins, and the invading Telmarines have driven the marvelous creatures - the dwarves, the talking animals, the not-so-mythical creatures into the margins, into the deep woods. Things have changed, while they were away - and almost at once they meet and strike an alliance with the fugitive Prince Caspian. He is of the Telmarine royalty, and in this millennium the rightful ruler of Narnia, but his usurping Uncle Miraz plotted to kill him, as soon as  Miraz' wife bore him a son. And that is the rest of the story - how Prince Caspian forms an alliance with not just the Pevensies, but with the original inhabitants of Narnia - the beasts and mythical creatures and even the forces of nature itself. The movie is beautifully visualized, and the locations where it was filmed are uniformly stunning - almost stars in their own right, along with the special effects.

Of the lavish extras included - the usual bloopers, `making of' and `behind the scenes' features, the stand-out is an extensive look at the `pre-vis' technology. It seems that increasingly very complicated; special-effect dependent movies such as this are almost completely done in a sort of a computer-animated story-board version before shooting begins. This is done for several reasons - to work out the mechanics of the shot, to allow the actors to know what the director has in mind for a particular sequence (which may take many days or weeks to complete!) and to show to producers and investors, so that they may know what they are getting. In the case of Prince Caspian, the `pre-vis' is almost an entire secondary movie.",1237680000,,2590,4.906392694063927

1610078,2,B00005JPH2,"Sometimes a first-time big-budget feature film director achieves great things with a fresh vision and new ideas.  This is not one of those times.  The director, who has helmed big-budget animated features, has never directed a big live-action film, and it shows.  The direction is amateurish at best.  The camera work and editing are baffling in many places.  Why have an aerial shot pointing straight down for 5 seconds as our heroes go underground, when that aerial shot tracks over some grass and rocks for 5 more seconds only to go to a fade to black transition to the next pointless shot?  And parts of the movie that should be dramatic turn out to be laugh-out-loud funny (and not in a good way).  The Mexican standoff in Miraz's chambers is the prime example of this.  And the Telmarine accent - hoo boy!  Let's just say that whenever one of the Telmarines speaks, you can't help thinking of Inigo Montoya from the far-superior ""Princess Bride.""

The true problem with this movie is the script.  Purists will decry any change to the source material in a motion picture; the problem is that changes necessarily have to be made to cram a novel into a 2.5 hour movie.  However, the changes here are enormous, and to no good end.  It's still unclear what's happening in half the movie, who the characters are, and why we should care.  The first Narnia movie excelled in plot and direction; ""Caspian"" is a letdown in both areas.  Let's hope that the experienced director heading ""Dawn Treader"" at Fox can do better.

If any of you had done research on the making of the movie you would find out that one of the reasons had to do with the fact that in the book Caspian and the Provensie children don't meet till toward the end of the story, but the reason Disney decided to give them more interaction was because they felt it would help the movie goers to connect with Caspian who was a new chracter being introduced to the story.  Another change adding the White Witch why did they do this to remind people of the orginal movie, not that we needed to be reminded, yes The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was a superior movie, mainly because it was well a superior book when you think about it.  Caspian is a good continuation in book form and in movie form, even if liberties were taken.  As for those who complained not enough Aslan, tell me just what do you want, read the book again, he is hardly in it either, but mentioned same as in the movie.

1610138,2,B00005JPH2,"I was very disappointed with how far this movie strays from the actual story!
It is ""roughly"" Prince Caspian but is lacking a lot of major elements.

Number one, they left out Aslan almost entirely until the very end. Those who are familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the story's strength and development. It was he who called the children into Narnia for his purpose an plan. Half of the book is about Aslan and the children, so the fact that they left his importance out of the movie really ruins the story.

No Aslan, no Narnia!

There are a number of other aspects that do not stick to the book, but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not strayed from the real ""Heart"" of the story.

The other big disappointment for me was how they altered Peter's character. His whole attitude changed. You never get a chance to warm up to him and in the end are almost glad that he will not be returning to Narnia. (The same can be said for Susan.)
The story line seemed very weak, and the relationship that they tried to create between Caspian and Susan was totally unnecessary and I felt, helped a great deal in ruining the film as well.

But if you are not interested in the faithfulness of the story, Andrew Adamson's ""Prince Caspian"" is an action packed adventure with many wonderful visual, and special effects.

However, I would highly recommend that you read the story. The book has so much more richness and purpose.
 I wish they had stuck to this story as well as they had the ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"".
I hope that they will do better on ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". We will see...!

I am certainly aware of many deviations from Lewis's story; still I thought it captured the essentials: Faith, Trust, Hope, and even Charity in the face of opposition, temptation, and despair. Peter returns to Narnia and tries to regain its freedom as a work of his own. Much like King Saul in Scripture, he is filled with pride and doomed to failure without the help of Aslan (Our Lord, the Rock); once he becomes aware of this he seeks his help, and with the help of his brother, sisters, Caspian, Aslan and the Narnians, finally succeeds (actually it is Aslan who completes the work). At the finish, with humility he passes on his sword to Caspian who rightfully assumes the throne he thought he was to regain. The film was superbly directed and acted. I give it five stars.",1233619200,,808,4.5793103448275865

I didn't see it initially because I heard that it's a darker story than the first (so I didn't take the kids to see it).  I'm glad I didn't read it before seeing the movie because it did introduce new ideas which I might not have welcomed.
  I liked the conflict between Caspian and Peter ... I would expect Peter to act that way since he was King for 15 years before going back home for a year, .. back to being a kid and taking orders rather than giving them.  Lewis didn't expand on how they could have been bored during that year back home and I liked seeing that in the movie. Peter is still a lovable character though.
  They could have drop the little romance between Caspian and Susan though.  The battle scene may have been long, but the sword fight scene was great.
  I feel that the little things like Caspian trying to rescue Dr. Cornelius (shows his strong bond to his tutor), or confront his uncle during the castle raid (and when his uncle lost to Peter with the sword fight), or the fail attempt during the castle attack, or blowing the horn at the moment when he's down instead of planning to blow it as it the book is a better choice, or the tense scene when the White Witch is summoned etc... did enhance the story.

1610209,4,B00005JPH2,I have not watched this movie for about 4 yrs but I remember it being very moving in how it portrayed the sacrifice a person makes in leaving home and family to physically fight an enemy who is determined to take away another culture's right and ability to live in a society with a democratic level of the right to choose for oneself one's future and present.  I met a man recently who said he had been in the battle portrayed in this film and he felt the movie was pretty accurate in capturing the intensity and brutality and terror of it.,1233532800,,540,4.294117647058823

1610211,4,B00005JPH2,"I do love the series. The casting was excellent. Lots of humor mixed in, which altered the tone of the movie a bit. I agree with others that the battle scenes comprise too much of this movie at the expense of plot development. The parts that needed to be developed were thin at expense of lots and lots of battle scenes. Seemed like most of the movie.

Lots of laughs mixed in as the characters seek to keep each other level-headed and down to earth:

Admirer: ""I've seen you. Eating by yourself.""
Susan: ""Yes, well, that's because I prefer to be left alone.""
Admirer: ""Me, too. What's you're name?""
Susan: (Irritated disgust) ""Phyllis.""
Lucy, running up: ""Susan!!!""

""I'm Peter. The Magnificent.""
""You probably could have left that last part off.""

While those types of lines were delivered very well and added to the reality and human nature of the characters, something desperately needed in a story where the characters don't show as much as they did in the first movie, sometimes I think the dynamics between the characters and the leveling jokes began to interfere; too forced in parts which made it a bit distracting, perhaps.

But it was nice to see those great actors and actresses in action once again. If you're a Narnia fan, this provides a nice entryway to return with the fab four to the mystical, magical world where everyday children become heroes and heroines who assume their right to the throne.",1233360000,,1414,4.7317073170731705
1610212,3,B00005JPH2,"Lets be frank: most of the fans of Narnia want the movie to be successful. And that bias may be contributing to the high rankings here. Take the name ""Narnia"" away from this movie and it's really a scattered story with special effects that drive the plot (and not the other way around) with very little going for it. If this were Wizard World 2 we would all be rating this a 2 or 3 at most.

There just isn't a reason for this movie; there is no moral. The first movie is a clear allegory of the cross, Christ, and salvation. Aslan makes sense to us and his sacrifice means something. In this movie, there isn't a clear explanation for most of the story.

This one question ruined the movie for me: why is Aslan missing and allowing his people to suffer? I've heard that this is an allegory of our world where God allows pain, suffering etc. In this movie Aslan shows up at the end (like he did last time) and saves the children and (few) surviving Narnians. Is this an allegory for the Return of Christ? It doesn't make sense. I don't think this can be an allegory for the End. It just doesn't fit.

Other questions: why are there Spaniards in Narnia? How is that a part of the plan? Why did the children have to come back?

It just wasn't impressive and the direction of these films is suddenly very much in question.

I can't recommend this to anyone other than Narnia fans or people who want to be fans of Narnia (ie, Christians.)",1233360000,2,1434,4.296296296296297

The Prince Caspian character wasn't as strongly presented as I think it could have been, but then he was supposed to be in trouble and needed the kings and queens of old to come to strengthen his opposition to the story's antagonists.

1610356,2,B00005JPH2,"Prior to the release of the film ""Prince Caspian"" I read that the scriptwriters were making some fairly significant revisions of the story in order to make it work better as a film.  The book Prince Caspian was described in these accounts as one of the weakest of the Chronicles of Narnia and as difficult to translate to the screen because of its narrative structure.  I took these warnings in good humor, knowing that films are usually quite different from their book sources and that such adaptations are not always bad.  I should have paid more attention to these preliminary hints of the film's direction.  After seeing the film, I was extremely disappointed in the end product.  Pathetically ironic is that fact that nearly every departure from the original story as conceived by C.S. Lewis resulted in a dilution of the story's original impact and power.  In this instance being slavishly faithful to the story would have given the film version a much better chance at achieving something worth watching.  As it was, the film has a confusing story line, less interesting and sympathetic characters when compared with the book and a much diminished sense of the divine order and purpose that pervades all of C.S. Lewis's books.

Much of the book is told in a long flashback during which Trumpkin the dwarf relates to the four Pevensie children the entire background history to the story, including how Caspian assumed the leadership of Old Narnia against his uncle King Miraz and the Telmarines and Trumpkin's own capture at the hands of Miraz's forces.  In attempting to eliminate the flashback and the historical details, the filmmakers completely mangle the events that lead to the calling of the four children back into Narnia, ending up with an illogical mess.  In the book Trumpkin is one of Caspian's most important advisors and is sent out by him to see what help the blowing of Queen Susan's horn may bring.  In the film, Trumpkin appears to have been captured by Miraz prior to meeting Caspian and can have no knowledge of his history, his purpose and his plans to free Narnia.  Yet somehow this ignorant Trumpkin still leads Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy back to help this Caspian whom he cannot know anything about.  Hollywood filmmakers constantly get away with illogical story lines due to the visual nature of their medium and the uncritical habits of their viewers.  But one cannot reduce a classic children's book beloved by thoughtful people all over the world to incoherence without suffering the consequences.

The scriptwriters and apparently director's lack of enthusiasm for the original story also greatly weakens the characters.  In the book Trumpkin is a lively, witty, expressive and cheerful character, a dwarf with the personality to match his red beard.  In the movie Trumpkin, astonishingly, is the opposite--stoic to the point of sullen, sardonic, glum in demeanor and rather dull.  One of the great heroes of Narnia is reduced by film to a bore.  Peter is another example of a character that the film renders unattractive and less interesting by simply departing from the book.  Originally noble and mature, the Peter of the movie has been transformed into a juvenile brawler who is jealous of Caspian and seems scarcely able to relinquish his power even at the film's end.  Caspian of the film is also a different creature altogether.  Whereas in the book one of Caspian's principle qualities was humility, the very thing that made him fit to rule Narnia in Aslan's estimation, the film Caspian is as arrogant and hot-blooded as the film Peter.  During the climactic scene when Peter is engaged in single-combat with King Miraz, Caspian rides off in love-smitten pursuit of Susan.  This detracts from the dramatic tension of the duel as well as portraying Caspian as less fit for leadership.

Other viewers may attribute these changes as a legitimate move to dramatize a sleepy story.  My conclusion is that these changes were not minor or arbitrary, but stem from the writers and director's lack of sympathy with the virtuous and moral divine order that undergirds all of Lewis's writings.  Obeying and relying on Aslan is a major theme of the book Prince Caspian.  The role of Aslan in the film, while not eliminated, is significantly reduced.  He goes from the major cause behind all important action to an interesting sideshow to all the action scenes and the invented rivalry between Peter and Caspian.  Reducing Aslan's presence in the story took the heart out of Prince Caspian, and probably had a ripple affect on the characterizations described above.  In the book much of the interesting character development involves how the various personalities relate to Aslan.  The exercise and development of patience, humility, obedience and faith with respect to Aslan are central to the book.  Because of the diminution of Aslan's place in the story and the changes in story line and characters, the portrayal of the struggle to develop these virtues essentially drops out of the film narrative.

Prince Caspian the film is an unengaging, uninspiring and wearisome production because it is a story without a heart.  The heart of this tale is still found in the book, where C.S. Lewis portrays exciting adventures in Narnia of characters who are challenged to follow the moral purposes of the great Aslan, creator, sustainer and redeemer of Narnia.  The creators of the film version thought they could retain a great story while making major changes to the original.  They failed because their changes were too substantive, detracting from the essence of what makes Narnia important and special.

An important parallel can be drawn to ""The Lord of the Rings"" film series created by Peter Jackson.  The utterances of Jackson and his associates make it clear that they share little in common with J.R.R. Tolkien's philosophical and religious beliefs.  Yet as great admirers of his books, they strove to stay as faithful as possible in the film recreation, resulting in three films that were not only very successful, but that also pleased the majority of Tolkien fans.  Those involved in the Narnia film project and any other version of a classic and beloved book should take careful notes.  Faithfulness to the spirit of a great book as well as the details as much as possible is a great recipe for success in a film adaptation, even when one is not wholly sympathetic to the book's themes.

While I believe the film Prince Caspian is an artistic failure, I am giving it two stars for some decent acting, good visuals, and some impressive special effects.",1232323200,14,6596,4.958181818181818

Hundreds of years have passed since the Kings and Queens of Narnia vanished, and now savage men focused only on war and violence rule.  Fortunately, there is a rightful heir, and even more fortunately, he can call on the Pevensie children to return and fight once more.

For some reason I missed the Chronicles of Narnia as a child, and on first reading them as an adult I found them enjoyable but feeble compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle earth.  I feared that I would have the same reactions to the movies, but I am glad to report that Prince Caspian, like its predecessor, fully depicts the grandeur, beauty, and emotions that C.S. Lewis intended.  The movie faithfully depicts the story, with some violent battle scenes, and faithfully transmits the symbolism as well.  This comes in for criticism from those who dislike the Christian message and for misinterpretation from those who claim to be ""Christian"" but wish to hijack the religion to meet their own social/political agendas.  What I find most appealing  about both Narnia films thus far is that they show Christianity as an ideal, the way Lewis wished to depict it, and not as self serving types would want to misuse it.",1232150400,5,1280,4.760180995475113

1610410,4,B00005JPH2,"I was puzzled on this movie as to what rating to give it. On the plus side, it has a wonderful insight into the nature of God. The reason that we don't often see God is that we are not looking for Him or we are just not looking in the right places. In the movie, the Characters did not see Aslan, but that was because they were not looking for him. Only Lucy was able to find Aslan because she wanted to see him.

The other excellent point the movie made was that we need to wait on God. King Peter made the mistake of not waiting on Aslan. He made a bad military move that cost him a lot.

It was just a little too predictable for me. For example: Prince Caspian found out that his father was killed by Miraz and he wanted revenge. This is used way too much in movies. Cant we be a little creative here? Images of the Princess Bride filled my head. ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.""

Another odd thing to me was that in the 1st one, the children were only used when they were not in Narnia. Once they went into Narnia, they were quite a bit older. This enabled them to have the strength to weild weapons, and the knowledge and wisdom to rule a kingdom.

In this second installment, they remain children throughout and we are offered no explanation on this. Was this because we were to draw the conclusion that where we are weak, God is strong? Or was it that the older versions of the children were not available for the shooting of the film?

This one was way better than the first. Not even a comparrison. The first one was a kids movie, but in this one, The Lion Witch and Wardrobe grew up. But the movie as a whole did not work well for me.

The day before the Pevensies arrive there is a major attack on the Telmarine army, which (due largely to a blunder by giant Winbleweather) goes badly, & many Narnians are killed. Explaining all this in a movie would be boring, at the very least. So instead Andrew [Adamson] moves the timeline about a bit & there you have it. This time it was Caspian who made the mistake, but I can hardly blame him ...

1610495,5,B00005JPH2,"A year has passed since the four Pevensies stumbled out of Narnia, and Susan believes they should get used to living permanently in their own world. After all, she, Edmund, and Lucy have been able to blend back into English society. Peter, unfortunately, is a different story. Accustomed to being High King, he strongly resents being treated as a child; and when the four are called back to Narnia by Susan's magic horn, Peter carries his resentment with him.

But Narnia is not the same land the Pevensies left. Over a thousand years have passed since their departure, and technologically advanced (at least for medieval times) Telmarines rule the country. Thoroughly modernistic, they hate and fear even the stories of Old Narnia, although they are somewhat pacified by a mistaken belief that the Old Narnian creatures are extinct. It is in this world that the Telmarine prince Caspian has been forced to flee his scheming uncle Lord Miraz, who wants to kill Caspian for control of the Telmarine throne. Given Susan's horn by his half-dwarf tutor, Caspian blew it at a time of need and called the Pevensies back.

Caspian has convinced the Old Narnians of his ability to lead when Peter and his siblings arrive. Due to a misunderstanding, their first meeting is actually a fight, and the relationship between Caspian and Peter improves little even after the confusion is cleared. Between the arrogance with which Peter leads, the anger at Miraz that Caspian fails to control, and the insecurities that both secretly harbor, the two allow their personal problems to interfere with their duties. An even greater problem is that only Lucy--and to a lesser degree, Edmund, who has learned to respect her--seeks Aslan's guidance. The vastly outnumbered Narnians have no chance at winning without Aslan, but pragmatism causes Peter, Caspian, and the Black Dwarf Nikabrik to look for other means of victory. Only a near disaster inside Aslan's How shows all concerned that without Aslan, the Narnian cause is hopeless. And nothing short of a miracle can avert defeat when the Narnians and Telmarines face off at last.

While the directors made many changes from the original book, none but a minor Susan-Caspian romance would probably have displeased C. S. Lewis. The characterization is strong; many of the seeming changes are actually a tweaking of hints already in the book, mainly from a following-Aslan-in-the-dark sequence that didn't make it into the movie. Peter and Caspian are both learning about leadership; Susan struggles with doubts about Aslan; Lucy learns the necessity of following Aslan even when no one else will back her up. Edmund's mistakes have affected him more than anyone else; while none of the others ever mentions his betrayal, he cannot forget. Only once does he speak up during a council meeting, and then to defend Peter. The statement of Lewis at the end of LWW, that Edmund became a quieter person than the others, comes to mind. Also, an interesting twist in the betrayal of Miraz's underlords is thrown in. Glozelle starts out by attempting to obey Miraz's orders to kill Caspian. In the end, he shows mercy to Caspian and is spared. Fellow-conspirator Sopespian chooses to stand against Aslan and is doomed. Really, that is the movie's central theme: without Aslan, no one in Narnia stands a chance. They may hate him, ignore him, insist he does not exist. But only his intervention saves Narnia in the end.",1231632000,2,3439,4.987804878048781

What happened? The scenery and special effects are spectacular, but there's so little characterization, I couldn't find anyone to root for. The Pevensie children are summoned to save Narnia, but they are presented as completely incompetent. Peter is so consumed with satisfying his own ego, he leads hundreds of innocent Narnians to a horrible death, yet he is never held accountable or shows any remorse. Edmund, who had such an interesting story arc in the first film, has nothing to do here but make a few jokes and fight. Ultimately, that's all this movie is, a series of impressive but boring battle scenes. I kept waiting for the Pevensie children to become the unified, caring family unit that made them so strong in the first film, but it never happens. There is no growth, no message, no lessons learned. This film could have been so much more, but sadly, the result is nothing more than 2 and 1/2 hours of eye candy.",1231459200,,1104,4.725388601036269

For example, what can happen if you are too proud to ask for help. Most movies that are made today don't have anything for kids or adults to learn - you just walk away saying ""oh - that was a good movie"" or ""What a waste of time""
With this movie, not only did I walk away saying that this was an exceptional movie but also with a bit more to ponder, that is if you pay attention.

The graphics are very well done and the blu-ray is outstanding. The extras on the DVD are even very good to watch (they really give you a good feel for the movie and all that went into making it).
Now, I haven't read the book yet but I think this is a great movie for all kids and adults to see.

I really enjoyed the first movie and I thought this one was just as well done. I know some other reviews beg to differ but then again, when has any part 2 movie ever received as good of reviews as the 1st? Well, I think this one should have. Oh - just as a side note, if anyone can fall a sleep during this movie then they could probably sleep through a real battle as well :-)

There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie.

1610580,1,B00005JPH2,"I write this from the point of view of someone who grew up knowing and loving C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia.  It was horrible to see, therefore, what some Peter Jackson-inspired movie director did to ""Prince Caspian.""

Everyone in the movie acts like a jerk.  The character called ""Peter"" picks fights with random people, agonizes over his ego and emotions, and gets a lot of people killed.  The character called ""Susan"" is given a gratuitous romantic sub-plotline with the character called ""Caspian.""  ""Caspian"" himself is a clueless and inept leader.  Both major and secondary characters are mean and creepy.  None of them are supposed to be that way.  It was all changed for the movie.

Sometimes when a story is expanded by being made into a movie, it becomes richer and more complete.  This is not one of those times.  The book made sense in its very simplicity, and because the simple things were straightforward it could also be a roaring good story.  In the movie, however, the changes make the story seem ridiculous.  Why would Caspian want to associate with the Narnians when they all seem to be snarling out of shadows and most of them look vaguely deformed?  Why would anyone want to follow the four Pevensey children into battle when they are mainly occupied with spiteful bickering?  The story makes perfect sense when the characters are friends held together by love and loyalty.  Without that, not even epic battles can redeem it, since while characters are locked in a death struggle you're only thinking, ""My gosh, this is embarrassing.  You're acting like idiots.  Please stop.""

The movie of ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"" held true to the book, but this is a different animal altogether.  Major digressions have been forced into the plot.  Good and valuable things from the book have been left out.  Others have been changed into weird and creepy perversions of themselves.

As for the filming itself, unlike ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe,"" much of the movie takes place in darkness.  It's a gray and grim world, and not in a good way.  Even though the movie does contain battles, swords, and sorcery (which it shouldn't), it was actually boring.  The characters were so objectionable that you didn't care what they were going to do.

Now, if you like stories with magic, mystery, glory, confrontations, battles, great swordfights, and the kind of fun and wonder that makes you long to be there yourself, there's a really good story that contains all of those things.  It's by C. S. Lewis, and it's called, ""Prince Caspian.""  I think you'll like it!",1231286400,24,2593,4.829545454545454

Susan is a case in point. In the books, Susan does not return to Narnia after ""Prince Caspian,"" but instead seeks life and properity in America.

1610676,2,B00005JPH2,"""Prince Caspian"" was almost entirely horrible. For those who love the book by C.S. Lewis, this is a movie you will only see once. Adamson strayed so far away from the story that it was hard to remember you were watching the tale of Prince Caspian at all. Many of the events are totally out of order, and Peter's character has been infused with a set of childish antics that greatly take away from the story as a whole. In the book, as the children return to Narnia, they quickly go back to having the mindset of great kings and queens, but unfortunately, Adamson chose to have Peter play a selfish, obstinate child rather than someone who has been a great leader. In one particularly heart-breaking scene that has no bearing whatsoever on Lewis's classic story, Peter makes a decision that brutally costs many of the Narnians their lives. This was the worst part of the movie because the arrogant judgment was not one that the character Lewis created would ever have made. I hate to think that many people will believe that this is the true story of Prince Caspian because of this movie. It is a deep shame that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was done so well, while this movie's only redeeming qualities were the interesting battle strategies and CGI techniques used. To put it in perspective, this movie was as disappointing for fans of the Narnia series as ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was for those who have followed the comics for years.",1231027200,4,1446,4.608527131782946

For example, when the cat was tied up by the mice. The fighting scenes are realistic and exciting. The sword fighting between Peter and King Miraz is tense and engaging.

The big problem is it has very little dialogues. That does not help me connecting with the characters. This movie is all about action and beautiful pictures. It's still a good movie for kids.

1610699,4,B00005JPH2,"I loved all seven books of The Chronicles of Narnia, and enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe's movie adaptation when it came out a few years ago (I don't really consider the BBC movies to be good or valid, so I tend to block out the fact that I've seen them).

I can't say that I didn't enjoy Prince Caspian, but I was disappointed in the amount of ""creative license"" taken.  What was all that tension about between Caspian and Peter, anyway?  It made them both seem petty and immature, and diminished their roles as nobel, ""good"" young men.  And why, oh why, does every director think there needs to be a romantic interest between any characters of the appropriate age?  That was just plain dumb, in my opinion...Susan is dislikable enough as it is without making her irritating as well.

I sometimes wonder if the people who write the screenplays ever read the original books they're supposed to be adapting.  Although Prince Caspian wasn't ""that bad"" when it came to it, I can only see a future of more and more deviation from the story as the movies go on (look at the Harry Potter movies and how vastly different from the books they've become, compared to the almost-perfectly-done first HP movie).  I would love to see more of these, but I would enjoy seeing them made well.

Another reviewer mentioned that he/she couldn't connect with the characters because of so little dialogue, and I realized that's what I'd been missing without being able to pinpoint it.  The dialogue and banter in a movie are the only insights we get to a character in a movie, since we can't see inside the mind as we can in a book.  Not every viewer prefers slam-bang action over plot content.

Yes, yes, I'll most likely see the next Narnia movie if/when it comes out, but I'll be hoping for better things.",1230768000,4,1801,4.559006211180124
1610700,2,B00005JPH2,"And this movie is a great example why.

It did everything that a movie like that should do, without any major mistakes. This sequel however lacks everything that made the first one good. It has no human element. It literally feels like they just went through the motions and decided to make a fantasy movie for kids, with no regard for script revision, character development, meaningful dialogue, etc. It's a BASIC kids movie, which means nothing truly has to be fleshed out. This approach will ALWAYS result in a fundamentally bad movie.

**All the charm from the first movie was gone, and other than Lucy, these characters just aren't likable very much at all. The girl playing Lucy did a great job here like last time though, I hope she gets many more roles.

**What's up with the constant, sweeping, forced, emotional music?

**Edmund and Susan felt like role players. They got lost amidst the shuffle of all these characters. It got to the point where I was consciously watching to see what lines they would speak next. And those lines mostly consisted of soulless, interchangeable lines that could've been spoken by one of the bears or cheetahs for all we care.

**I really hate to compare it with the Lord of the Rings movies, but it's really hard not to do when you have walking trees going into battle, a water creature summoned to wash away bad guys on horseback, and bow and arrow tricks being performed which doesn't involve actually shooting the arrow..

**Susan's kiss to Caspian at the end goes in my book as one the most contrived kisses I've seen in awhile. There was nothing that happened for her to even develop these feelings. From what I can recall, there was no more than one or two times that they even specifically looked at each other. And during the times they did that (looked at each other), I was actually praising the movie that they didn't overdo it with these forced exchanges where the girl shyly looks at the handsome hero, with just a hint of a smile on her face, as she then walks away as the hero searchingly gazes at her, with a wondering, thoughtful look on his face, before the scene fades to the next. I was glad they DIDN'T go this route and kept it subtle. Well so much for that; she ends up randomly KISSING him on the mouth at the end. Contrary to what movies may have you believe, this NEVER happens. Ever. No girl does that. Think about it from a real life perspective, this would be the equivalent of you helping a female friend unpack her things after a move, during which time her female roommate is also there (which sets the scenario for you sort of knowing this other girl), and then after all the unpacking is done, the roommate comes up to you and just plants one on your mouth. How realistic does that sound? Bottom line: no girl walks up to a random guy and just kisses him on the lips. This whole clichd romance angle hurt this movie's credibility even more.

**I haven't seen a forced romance this...forced, since Winona Ryder inexplicably fell in love with Edward Scissorhands after she saw him on TV and he said he would ""do anything for her.""",1230681600,3,3327,4.747404844290657
1610701,3,B00005JPH2,"Purists will revile this adaptation of C.S Lewis's Prince Caspian as it takes quite a few liberties in adapting the book  but on the whole, I thought the production quality in this movie was much better than the previous instalment. And though this adaptation is not faithful to its source, the movie itself is entertaining with some great special effects [though not quite the caliber of LOTR].

The story [unlike the book] begins in Narnia, where a woman gives birth to a boy and Prince Caspian [Ben Barnes, looking uncannily like a young Keanu Reeves] is awakened by his tutor/mentor and told to flee for his life, Turns out, Prince Caspian's uncle, the evil Lord Miraz [Sergio Castellito] now has an heir and is plotting the Prince's demise. Caspian flees into the forest where he meets Narnians, who have been presumed to be long extinct.

Back in England, the Pevensie's are wondering if they'll ever go back to Narnia - it's been a year [their time] and Peter [William Moseley] yearns for the days when he was High King, his younger brother Edmund [Skandar Keynes] seems to be bailing his older brother out of brawls, Susan [Anna Popplewell] has blossomed into quite a lovely young lady and Lucy [Georgie Henley] also yearns to be back in Narnia. Their wish is granted when Caspian blows the horn that summons the Pevensie's back to Narnia. It seems that 1,300 yrs have passed since they were last there and things have changed drastically. Lucy claims to have seen Aslan, but none of the others have seen him and they don't believe Lucy. The siblings soon run into Caspian and band together to help the Narnians reclaim their kingdom from Lord Miraz and the Telmarines [the humans who live in Narnia].

The spiritual themes that abound in C.S Lewis' work is not much evident here - to delve deeper into that aspect, one will have to read the books. I also felt that there were some unnecessary diversions such as the alluded to romantic spark between Caspian and Susan. Caspian's character is not very well-developed here. The acting of the main characters seem quite wooden most of the time, not much of an improvement since the last instalment. Also, some of the battle scenes seemed to be rip-offs from LOTR, though there were some interesting elements. I liked the chivalrous, warrior mouse Reepicheep [voice of Eddie Izzard] and also the dwarf Trumpkin [Peter Dinklage] - both made for credible and interesting supporting characters.

1610747,5,B00005JPH2,"I watch fantasy movies for the fantasy aspect.  For some unknown reason, I have never read the Narnia series (although they do reside in my TBR mountain), so my take on Prince Caspian reflects the fact that I look upon the plot not to see the faithfulness to the book but to see the continuity from Chronicles and the storyline as a whole.

Peter becomes the brat-like teen boy I expected after no longer being High King, and I was not totally surprised to see Edmund reversing his prior role of trouble-maker and cleaning up after Peter.  Susan's aloofness was not so much her loss of position--I have always seen her as the shyest and most reserved of the quartet; it was quite nice to see her break free and begin to act more independently.  Dear Lucy with her complete faith and certainty that all will be well no matter how dark things may seem does not come across as denial of reality--it shows complete conviction in the ability of any man (or creature) to choose right over wrong.  Prince Caspian showed a healthy skepticism of Peter just often enough to infer that he also felt out of his league some of the time; all-in-all, a quite realistic portrayal of a young, untried monarch who really wants to do the right thing but is sometimes unsure what the right thing entails.

This was definitely a darker tale.  The battle scenes were not the only darkness prevailing thoughout and the glimpse of the White Witch was such a powerful reminder that not all help offered is help worth taking.

1610748,2,B00005JPH2,"Due to overseas travel I missed the chance to see this movie in the theaters and had been eagerly anticipating it for a Christmas present.  Now I wish I had asked for something else.

I have read and cherished the Narnia series for many many years and Prince Caspian has always been one of the ones I loved the most.

This was *not* the book I know and love.  While the costumes and the scenery and the music were very well done (except for that god awful atonal yodeling song that starts up at the end of the movie).. I really didn't feel any love for the book in the movie.  They changed *so* much of the dialog and the story I really felt they had missed the sentiment behind it... if I was a teacher I'd ask the director if he really read the book or if he just looked at the Cliff's notes.

*** Spoilers ***

The constant posturing between Peter and Caspian and in fact the aggressive and hostile personality they gave Peter... Where did that come from? And the trumped up romance between Susan and Caspian? bleh... Where was *that* in the book??  What *was* in the book was Aslan who was mostly missing in the movie, the sentiments and the lessons and the blossoming of the Pevensies into their older selves and their reunion with Aslan .. all of that was left out.  Trumpkin was reduced to a bit player in the background which really irritated me.  They skipped the freeing of the town of Beruna in favor of *more* unneeded combat/battle scenes.  It seems the movie was mostly made by a bunch of guys who really like medieval(ish) warfare reenactments and had been given carte blanch to go nuts with a large movie budget behind them.

The whole siege the castle bit as well was entirely fabricated and unnecessary.  At the end of the movie I was left with a feeling of ""ok now where is the rest of the book?""  Quite a letdown and very sad because the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe was done pretty well and had stayed fairly true to the book- it really got my hopes up for Caspian which promptly dashed them.

I can only hope they learn from the mistakes they've made and do not butcher the Voyage of the Dawntreader in the same manner.

I'd give it 1.5 stars if there were halves available.",1230422400,11,2200,4.342298288508557
1610749,4,B00005JPH2,"The first Chronicles of Narnia movie, ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" came out around the time that many fantasy books were being bought up and while it wasn't as affecting or as memorable, it did do its job well despite some dodgy CGI and some ineffective directing during battle scenes. But it was still a success so out of the 7 books written, the next to be made was ""Prince Caspian"" but instead of releasing it at the time of Christmas like last time, Disney decided to play with the big boys and put it in the summer, being effectively sandwiched by ""Iron Man"" and the 4th ""Indiana Jones"" and let's not forget about that certain bat movie. So ""Prince Caspian"" grew less and people didn't like the tone but will it find a bigger audience at home or was it possibly too dark and not enough magic?

The Pevensie children, Lucy, Peter, Edmund and Susan, have been living in England for a year trying to get back to normal which is tough after saving the magical kingdom of Narnia. Out of the blue, they're returned to Narnia only now it's almost abandoned with nary a creature in sight, only ruins. Seems that near a millennium has passed in the land of Narnia and thanks to Telmarines, the race of men, the citizens of Narnia have been all but extinct. Rightful heir to the throne is Prince Caspian who's been targeted by death by his uncle Miraz who wishes to take over the throne and so with the help of the Pevensies and the Narnians, Caspian hopes to defeat the incoming soldiers.

It's usually common practice for the second film in a series to be a little bit more darker in tone or at least more adult, thinking being that since you've grown since the last book/movie, so have the characters. But then again, Narnia is a children's series of books with adult fans and an adaptation that screams for something more exciting so it's kind of like the ""rock and a hard place"" saying. Go too dark and you've alienated mostly everyone whereas if you keep the warm, friendly family tone then you're just lightweight fun and nothing more. And I can say that ""Prince Caspian"" does maintain an excitement about it and the last battle is quite awesome however the tone and even the pacing of the film feels a bit...off and whereas the previous film had many moments of otherworldlyness and fantasy moments, this film feels more like a normal adventure film with characters in it from fantasy. Maybe if they ever make the third they'll combine the 2 and make it better but this film feels less fantasy and more adult than you'd hope a film like this to have.

That being said, many elements have been improved on from the quality to the animation (save for a dodgy late film sequence involving a river) to the character performances and even Adamson's directing skills have been a little bit more improved and despite some complaints about it being too different than last time, it's still engaging and keeps your interest though I wish Aslan had a bigger role though he is that secret weapon that when unleashed, practically owns everything in the room, his limited involvement kind of hurts it and he might as well be a cameo or at least to show you that despite the talking mice and dwarves, the lion is still in the movie. Then there's the odd brief sequence from a character from the last movie that kind of gives a ""what was that for?"" feeling. But the villain is just as sinister as Tilda Swinton was and Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse voiced by Eddie Izzard is memorable (though sadly not used frequently) and you have a movie that works well enough for adults and even kids might like it though might need to turn down the volume a little. Even the entrance to Narnia itself this time is rather...loud.

The Narnia films seem to be the easiest contender to fit alongside ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Ring"" films for some of the better fantasy adaptations but there just seems to be something not getting across, something that feels bigger than the sum of its parts where it turns from a good book adaptation to a great movie, period.

1610752,1,B00005JPH2,"C. S. Lewis was one of the greatest writers and storytellers of the twentieth century, whose work could not have been improved upon. However, this is just what the makers of this film have unsuccessfully tried to do. Abbreviation is understandable and often necessary, but the filmmakers have seemingly abandoned much of what makes this story distinctive. For example, Lewis's Caspian - truly brave and noble despite his inexperience and misgivings - is turned into a stubborn, rash, and rather petty young man (an inappropriate portrayal of what is commonly thought of as modern teenage angst?). In the book, Peter assures Caspian that he (Peter) hasn't returned to take Caspian's throne, but to restore Caspian to it, and that is that. In the film, we get a lot of petty squabbling before the question is settled. Of course the love interest between Caspian and Susan is quite out of place and ridiculous. In the book, Aslan is guiding the whole affair even though he appears only half-way through. In the film, the lion doesn't really appear until the near the end, and we do not get the feeling that he is really in control of events the whole time (this is an idea that Lewis presents more clearly in The Horse and His Boy, but it is present in this book as well) We get the sense that the characters are sort of left to their own devices. Some of Lewis's beautifully rich statements are conspicuously absent, in favor of some rather cliched one-liners...it seems the filmmakers are assiduously avoiding much of the philosophical underpinnings of this story. To be quite honest, if it is necessary to do so, I, for one, would rather they find their source material elsewhere. I'm sure there are many appropriate subjects for an action/war/fantasy movie out that will satisfy moviegoers without damaging many people's concept of such a great work of fiction.

However, the whole Aslan revealing himself to the children, first to Lucy, then to Edward, then Susan and Peter was really key to the whole plot and lessons to be learned from the story. Lewis was trying to tell a good story, but he was passing on spiritual truths of Christianity as well. Edward, gets a ""Well Done"" from Aslan in the book because he trusted Lucy this time. The movie missed this ""walk of faith"" analogy almost completely. Although it did have Edward redeeming himself so to speak in a scene that isn't in the book.

Oh well, the movie kept a lot of the good scenes of the books. I enjoyed it and I'll have to watch it again. Some of the changes were good. Even though PC was mainly about the war to free Narnia, I think they played up the battle too much. It will be interesting to see how they handle ""The Horse and His Boy"", which only has one battle and ""Dawntreader"" that has no battles.

One other thing that ticked me off, Aslan sends Peter and Susan back, if memory serves, and tells them that they must learn to seek him there (back in England). The movie skips that part, which I thought was a key lesson from the book.

The movie introduced a romance between Caspian and Susan. I think that was cool.

In summary, the movie was good, but it could have been so much better. It's a children book and it feels like they are ramping up the action for adults. However, it's the adults that can take the subtlety. By the way, my friend from England thought the movie was better than the Lion, the Witch and Wardrobe.",1229731200,2,1693,4.348101265822785

1610756,3,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is the second installment of the Narnia series by C.S. Lewis.  In this film, the Pensevie children return after one year to find Narnia completely overrun by enemy forces they had kept at bay while there.  To their shock, they realize that 1,300 years had passed since that fateful day they came back through the wardrobe.  The Narnia they knew is gone and enemies who once would have slew each other with little thought have become powerful allies against a more powerful foe.  In addition, a young Telmarine prince claiming rightful rulership is exiled from his throne by his own diabolical uncle.
  I liked this film but I'll be the first to admit it isn't on the same level as the first one.  Some of the sequences were spectacular such as the assault on the castle and the battle between Peter and Miraz.  However, I couldn't help but be reminded of Rings when I saw the trees and water spirit near the end of the movie.  I wasn't too crazy about the violence these kids engaged in but that how it's written in the book.  I'd still recommend this but not as strongly as the first film.",1229731200,,1105,4.507537688442211
1610797,5,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is the second film in the Narnia franchise and definintly avoids a lot of the miss falls of sequels, becoming a very worthy addition to the franchise.

The film continues on after the first film, with the Pevensie children returning to Narnia a year after their first adventure. But as they look around them, they realise that this is not the same Narnia of which they remembered. It turns out that over a thousand years have passed and Narnia has been invaded by the Telmarine's, who have pushed the Narnians into extiction and hold over the land with an iron grip. The children are now forced to take back their land, with the aide of the exiled Telmarine Prince Caspian, who seeks the throne from his murderous uncle Miraz.

Like many fantasy films, this sequel is darker then the first, with a lot more action and battles then in LWW, which should appease fans who found that the action was skimping. The effects have also improved a lot as well and the addition of such characters as the mouse Reepicheep and Trumpkin the drawf adds some comic relief.

While this is a good sequel, I still don't think it exceeds the first film and that although there is a good dose of action, the magic dosen't really feel that present.

I realize that in film adaptions of books you have to cut things out. I have mostly resigned myself to the fact that certain liberties will be taken. That being said, I am still completely shocked and disgusted at this version of Prince Caspian. I won't go into everything they did wrong but here are some things that really bothered me:
1) the scene where they attack the castle - I mean, REALLY? You leave out so much great stuff from the book and add...this?
2) the romance between Caspian and Susan - there was not a HINT of this in the book at all.
3) Peter and Caspian constantly going at it - again, not a hint of this in the book, Caspian is always bowing to Peter's authority
4) the witch comes back - yes, they discussed bringing her back in the book. NO, they did not actually do it.

I'll spare you the rest of my (very long) list, but let me just say that I feel sorry for everyone who watched it with me because I spent most of the time yelling at the tv screen. It just burns me up that they had all the components to make a great movie - an awesome cast of actors, good costuming, beautiful scenery and sets, a HUGE budget - and this is the best they could come up with.

I didn't much like the first NARNIA film, mainly because of the kids. I found them terribly annoying, obnoxious, terminally cute. I figured I'd try the sequel because they're now older. Wrong. They're still annoying, especially the youngest. (I never like Shirley Temple, either.)

The movie is very dark, in both senses of the word: the tone and the lighting are dim. The thing goes on far, far too long and is far too talky. The kids really have no personality and so it's hard to work up any sort of interest in them or their situation.

The concept of being transported back to Narnia, but hundreds of years after their first visit, is fascinating. Time travel has always been a favorite theme of mine. But with these kids as travel companions, I'll pass on the trip.

Peter Dinklage is a wonderful actor (witness THE STATION AGENT), but he's wasted in this. Ben Barnes (Prince Caspian) is an attractive guy, but he doesn't quite have the spark he needs. The only interesting character is the nasty King Miraz (Sergio Castellito), and he's killed off. So when Round 3 comes out, I'll know better than getting suckered into buying it.

1610848,4,B00005JPH2,"The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the best collections of children's literature ever written. The movie adaptations therefore have a lot to live up to. You know the old adage ""the book was so much better than the movie,"" and in general that almost always is the case. But aside from mostly unfair comparisons to the books, there is very little not to love in these two movies. They are not the books, but they are great movies and well worth owning.

""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" and ""Prince Caspian,"" which are included in this two pack are both great movies that capture the imagination of the books. I'll not take a bunch of time to explain the plot lines, as most people are either familiar with the movies, or can read a plot summary elsewhere. Suffice it to say that both movies are quality, and not just a CGI fest without a proper storyline.

""Prince Caspian"" is darker than ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" and might be scary for some children. It has some fairly frightening scenes in it, so be forewarned.

What is fantastic about this collection is the sheer quality of the blue-ray picture. I've seen quite a few blue-rays at this point, and these two are a couple of the best out there as far as quality of picture. The other thing worth mentioning is that the sound is also stellar, and on a 5.1 sound system really puts you directly into the movie.

1)  It was darker and more adult.  The characters were more cynical, the opening scene of a woman giving birth was not needed, Miraz was far more cruel than he was in the book and so on.

2) The charactes were out of character.  The romance between Susan and Caspian was out of place, Reepicheep became a sad attempt at comic relief rather than a gallant mouse, Peter was a sullen, whiney, self centered teenager instead of the high king.  Trumpkin was not a DLF!  He was surly and cynical.  The only one in character was Lucy.

3) The storyline was WAY OFF!!  The beruna bridge was stone in the book and had been built long before.  There was no high school fight in the beginning, there was no attack on Miraz's castle.  Peter and Caspian worked together instead of fighting.

Overall the movie was dumbed down.  It was as though the movie makers felt they needed to improve the book in order for people to enjoy it.  Why is it so hard to just follow the book when mkaing a movie?  Especially such a wonderful classic that still appeals to all ages years after it was written.

At some point I might be able to watch it as just a movie instead of a Chornicle of Narnia but I doubt it.",1228953600,28,1454,4.311111111111111

Then came the sequel. I remember sitting in the theater, with my arms crossed and thinking, ""Okaaaay. Impress me.""

(Some SPOILERS follow.)

Thankfully, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: PRINCE CASPIAN improves on the first film. And, even if it does veer away from the source material for a bit, the crux of the story remains the same. I guess it makes sense that the titular character is given more attention, although his tepid romance with Susan (which isn't in the book) unfolds almost in passing. Ben Barnes turns in a so-so performance, his Caspian relegated to going thru the familiar heroic posturings. He's really not even the main protagonist; that would be Peter. Hopefully, Barnes's acting improves, or the script does, because he'll play an even larger role in the third film VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. But PRINCE CASPIAN, the movie itself, is pretty damn entertaining.

The movie eventually shifts its focus on the four Pevensie children, but first we get caught up with some doings in Narnia, in which many ages had elapsed and the times again are troubled. The opening passage introduces us to the young Telmarine prince, Caspian, who is very soon forced to flee from his murderous uncle and his sharp-bearded soldiers. In his meanderings in the woods, Caspian comes across the fabulous folk and Talking Beasts of Narnia, thought to have become extinct during the cruel Telmarines' reign (or was it that they were never supposed to have existed, in the first place?). Within these expatriated creatures Prince Caspian stokes the fires of rebellion. And, so, the battle is on, to reclaim the old kingdom of Narnia.

Note that, in his frantic flight from his uncle, Caspian had blown an ancient mystical horn, rumored to summon aid in times of dire need. Rumor's true.

Back in World War II-era England Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie have grown a year older since their unlikely adventures, and they often wonder if they'll ever set foot on Narnia again. As they await their train in the hectic railway station, they quite suddenly find themselves whisked away from the bustle of noisy old England and into desolate, unfamiliar surroundings. The Pevensies stumble onto an ancient, broken down castle, and it shockingly dawns on them that they're wandering around in the ruins of Cair Paravel, their old home when they reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and when Peter was High King. They soon unearth their most cherished treasures, those gifted to them by Father Christmas: Peter's sword and shield, Susan's bow and arrows, and Lucy's tiny bottle of healing cordial (Edmund, if you recall, wasn't around when Father Christmas was doling out presents). As expected, Susan's horn is missing.

The Pevensies, not long after, fight off two Telmarine soldiers on a boat and rescue their sullen captive dwarf from drowning. A further chain of events would have the children learning that thirteen hundred years had gone by, and that, in the meantime, Narnia had been invaded by the Telmarines. The children soon encounter Caspian and his ragtag troops, which then allows for the epic stuff to be unleashed and for Aslan's inevitable return.

One of my gripes in the first film was that I didn't buy into the actor playing Peter. But he's better in this one. Perhaps being a few years older helped him to grow into the role. The rest of the British kids are also good, although Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund had always been spot on. Edmund actually is pretty good in a swashbuckling role, and Anna Popplewell (Susan) gets to actually throw down with her bow and arrows. But, when you get right down to it, the talented Georgie Henley still provides the most heartfelt emotional punch. There's a pure simple joy, wonderful to behold, in Lucy's unbridled love for and faith in Aslan.

Deciding to insert even more thrills, the film strays from the book and invents new sequences centering on Peter and Caspian's exiled, makeshift army attempting to take the fight to Caspian's uncle, who happens to rule this new Narnia. There's also the return of an old foe, that awkward thing between Caspian and Susan, and leader-of-the-pack friction developing between Peter and Caspian. And again veering away from the book, Peter demonstrates an angry, combative side, which manifests early on, in a schoolboy row back in wartime London. It's... interesting. And I guess it's better than being bland, which is what Peter was in the first film.

No gripes at all about the visual effects. No gripes about the look and feel of the movie, which is remarkable and epic (although not coming near the scope of, say, LORD OF THE RINGS). New characters come in and quickly ingratiate themselves. There's the endearingly surly dwarf Trumpkin, the wise badger Trufflehunter, and the chattery squirrel Pattertwig. There's another dwarf Nikabrik, who's even surlier than Trumpkin, but he's not exactly what one would label as ""endearing."" The best Talking Beast, hands down, is Reepicheep, the chivalrous mouse who brooks no insults. Reepicheep is voiced by Eddie Izzard, who declares that his character is ""Mad Max crossed with a Storm Trooper."" One of my favorite moments in the book is of the conversation between Reepicheep and Aslan regarding the magnificent mouse's hacked-off tail. I think the movie does it justice.

Three discs in this packaging, plenty of in-depth bonus stuff. Disc One offers the feature film, as well as a fun audio commentary by Director Andrew Adamson and young actors Ben Barnes (Caspian), Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), and Anna Popplewell (Susan).

Disc Two has the making-of featurette ""Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns"" (35 minutes long); ""Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life"" (23 minutes) is a pretty neat segment, demonstrating that the bulk of the sets aren't CG - and you do get a sense of just how huge an undertaking the set-creating process is (also features Douglas Gresham, the film's co-producer and C.S. Lewis's step-son, who here reads brief excerpts from the book); ""Big Movie Comes to a Small Town"" - focusing on the small, picturesque Slovenian town of Bovec and the logistics of shooting the sequence in which the water titan destroys the bridge (23 minutes).

Also on Disc 2: ""Previsualizing Narnia"" - about an animated storyboarding device called pre-vis, used in prepping for this film (10 minutes); ""Talking Animals and Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia"" - the cast & crew (but mostly crew) reflect on Narnia (5 minutes, kinda dull); ten deleted scenes with director's intros (11 minutes), none of which are particularly must-see, although one deleted scene develops deeper the attraction between Caspian and Susan; some okay bloopers (3 minutes); ""Secrets of the Duel"" - how Peter and King Miraz's duel was brought to life (7 minutes); ""Becoming Trumpkin"" - focus on Peter Dinklage, who's quite terrific as Trumpkin (5 minutes); and an 11 minute look at ""Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik"" as we follow him during one arduous day of shooting (remember him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Willow-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Willow (Special Edition)</a>?). And Disc Three is the digital copy.

So, I guess I'm finally invested in this film franchise and now find myself hugely anticipating THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, which returns Caspian, Edmund, Lucy, and Reepicheep, and also debuts the sniveling Eustace. It's a good thing that there's an ample turnover of sons of Adam and daughters of Eve in the Narnia chronicles. Else, these kid actors would be sprouting stubbles before the film series is done.

1610852,2,B00005JPH2,"What a huge disappointment. I loved the first movie so much, and the kids were excellent actors and delivered their roles impeccably. I don't know what happened to their acting talents in this movie however. Did they change directors? Especially the oldest brother, his stiff facial expressions and lack of words got on my nerves. The yonger brother did a decent job though. Lucy was alright.
I haven't read the books at all, nonetheless I seem to share many of the views of other reviewers here who have read them. The love story is unbearably phony, since it's not really a love story at all, just a handful of romantic comments thrown in along with a spark-less kiss at the end. The tension between Caspian and the older brother is similarly out of place. I was completely confused by the lack of development of Aslan's role in this movie. Where had he been all this time? What made him help the kids out in the end, and why did he wait in the first place? I mean, a lot of those poor creatures actually died, and a gruesome death at that, yuck!
The events unfolded much too quickly to give any depth whatsoever to this movie. The White Witch for example--what did that little episode have anything to do with the rest of the story? The scene was utterly sad--only the Witch managed to deliver a believable performance.

So, two stars for the amazing special effects. However I'd be much happier with a more professional performance of screenwriter and director.
We know the actors are good, they just weren't given anything to work with. Perhaps too much money was spent on those nice props, the rest was sort of an afterthought.",1228694400,2,1633,4.6116838487972505

If you are watching the movie without having ever read the books then it could be called a decent story. However, if you are expecting it to re-tell the story of Prince Caspian, then you will be greatly disappointed.

Once again, Hollywood thought they could improve a story by re-making it, and once again they failed. A prime example . . . the added ""romance"" between two of the main characters. This was the worst addition of all!",1228694400,10,741,4.529850746268656

This being said up front, the overall movie was solid and entertaining, with the exception of just too much of the fight scene detail, which of course Lewis did not emphasize in his work.  Not his mission.  Would have thought the co-producer Gresham would have vetoed such ""hollywoodizing.""  Good acting, voices for Reepicheep and Trufflehunter, and CG so good!  Scenery was gorgeous!

1610856,5,B00005JPH2,"***WARNING: There are SPOILERS in this review!***

Here's the deal. This was my LEAST favorite book in the series. As a kid, I found this book to be slow and boring. So my expectations were oh so low. I even forced myself to re-read it before the movie came out. As an adult, I found the book to be much better than I remembered it to be, probably because the plot was more mature, involving a power struggle over the throne and war, which I didn't really get as a kid, and it had little character development.

The movie actually improved on the book! I liked that they made Price Caspian older by about 5 or 6 years, and I liked the subtle crush Susan and Caspian had on each other in the movie. I even liked the failed attempt to take over the castle. I was on edge the whole time and the end of that scene was so sad. Those who didn't like any changes were purist and didn't like it when film makers took such liberties, but in this case, all of the changes really helped to improve the movie to be more interesting and enjoyable than the book. The first movie was more innocent and magical. This movie was definitely darker primarily because CS Lewis wrote it that way. The film makers made it even darker by adding a surprise threat from the White Witch.

My favorite book is the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which is also the next movie in the series. This next one will have the harshest judgment from me because my expectations for it are so high. It makes complete sense for Prince Caspian to be older (like 19 or 20 yrs. old) in the movie since he's supposed to get married at the end of the next movie if they stick to the book. In the book, Caspian is only around  15 or 16 yrs old, too young to marry, in my opinion.

Ignore those negative reviews! The battle scenes and the end were oh SO WORTH it! I love Prince Caspian as much or more than the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, which I didn't think was even possible. Five STARS for Prince Caspian the movie!",1228608000,3,1973,4.208994708994709
1610887,2,B00005JPH2,"When the first film came out I saw it right away. I have read all the books numerous times and thoroughly enjoyed each one. While I thought they could have done better with the first film I also recognized that one can only do so much in film adaptions of stories like these. I eagerly anticipated the second film, hoping that it would pick up the slack where the first movie failed and build upon it to make the series great.

Boy, was I disappointed.

Prince Caspian is (unfortunately) a shining example with what is wrong with the fantasy film genre today. Let me take you through just a few of the arguments I have with this film:

1. Actors/Acting - The formula Disney seems to be taking with these films is one we have seen way too many times before: Hire a cast of cute/adorable budding young ""actors"", maybe throw in a teen heartthrob character (in this case Prince Caspian) and if he can speak in an accent even better! Then cross your fingers and hope that the fact that almost none of them can act will be covered up by their charming good looks. This is terrible and inexcusable. There are plenty of cute AND talented actors out there. This just makes me think they went with the cutest kids they could find and said ""Hey do you want to be in a BIG MOVIE?"" Now I know this is not the case, but still they could have done so much better.

2. Music - Blah... more of the same. Which in itself might not be too bad if it was given new life. but it really did feel like a rehash of the same stuff we heard in the first film.

3. Cinematography - Ahh! This has really been bothering me and it is something that has bothered me since the first film. This film suffers... yes SUFFERS... from ""Lord of the Rings"" syndrome. Ever since Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings trilogy (which was brilliant) and Hollywood found out that big epic films with sprawling landscapes and enormous battle scenes will make bank at the box office they have been obsessed with recreating the success of LOTR. The problem of this is while this concept works well with LOTR, it doesn't necessarily work well on EVERY fantasy film. Maybe if more time was put into story development in this film, and less time into crazy special effects and overwhelming battle sequences we might have a film worth seeing. Seriously, how many times are we going to see a battle of millions of little computer generated sprites with catapults before it gets old. Its already old for me.

These things are just a taste of the flaws of this film, the list could go on. I only give this movie a 2 star rating because, although it is terrible, it is watchable (Although I would not advise you to do so).

If you are looking for a well thought out and enjoyable fantasy film that you can keep coming back to... trust me... look elsewhere.",1228608000,2,2803,4.378846153846154
1610888,1,B00005JPH2,"Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two ""bland"" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.

Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.

I thought it was about time someone mentions these points.",1228521600,9,651,4.038759689922481

1610890,3,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is the follow-up to the the very popular Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe of the Chronicles of Narnia book series.

Full of battle scenes, some pretty spectacular. Small children may struggle with fearful images. One scene was particularly sad involved several Narnians caught behind enemy lines awaiting death.

As in the first movie loads of creatures make up Narnia's population. All had been living underground since shortly after the kings and queens of Narnia had returned to England. Sir Reepicheep mouse-knight is a nice addition adding humor and zest to the film. Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy are back -- called to help Narnia from the brink of extinction. Prince Caspian lands in Narnia as he runs for his life. His evil uncle has produced an heir so Caspian X needs to be exterminated. Aslan makes an appearance and the White Witch drops in for a short while.

The story is so big and the cast so large that though the actors tried there was a feel of underdevelopment between several major relationships. I'd like to say I loved the film. And there are many reasons I liked it but several that just left me cold.",1228521600,,1136,4.7272727272727275

I felt like someone was trying to replicate Lord of the Rings.  I think C.S. Lewis would have been disappointed in the movie and feel that it missed the whole point of the story.

For the next movie, I hope they return to the story a bit more.",1228521600,2,397,4.103896103896104
1610892,2,B00005JPH2,"They rushed making it and it is not at the quality as the first.  Not a movie that I will watch over and over, dissapointed is my overall opinion.",1228521600,,146,4.0344827586206895
1610893,4,B00005JPH2,"First, I will start off by saying that if you are a Book Nazi, this movie is NOT for you. There are a lot of changes to the plot and some additional scenes added, as well as the Susan and Caspian romance (UGH - but more on that later). There is quite a bit removed and shuffled around in order for it to work as a film. But the thing is, it still works as a story. It's not perfect, but it is good.

As a huge fan of the books and the first film, I was eagerly anticipating this one and was (mostly) not disappointed. True, there are significant differences in character development and the pacing of the story, but I think those changes work for the best. One such change is Peter's decision to attack the castle. Now, I know that this seems out of character for him, but if you really think about it, he's a kid eager to prove himself and also on his guard because of a new rival (Caspian). He's going to want to show that he really is King Peter the Magnificent. Well, he fails, of course, but it was still an incredibly well-done and tragic scene. William Moseley got some flack for being a little wooden in the first movie...well, just watch this scene, particularly toward the end. He's more than earned his acting stripes, in my opinion.

Everything is better this time around: there is more character development, better special effects (particularly the CGI creatures), absolutely beautiful sets and backgrounds, and all the returning cast has improved in their performances. Georgie Henley and Skander Keynes in particular were a joy to watch - one look at Georgie and you can tell she'll be a real beauty when she's older. (And Skandar's filled out nicely himself...)

That being said, I do have some quibbles with this movie. It's not perfect. There are a couple of awkward moments which are supposed to be comedic, but feel slightly out of place with the scope of the movie (the scene with Reepicheep, Pattertwig, and the nuts remark comes to mind here). It's much darker, which I enjoy, but this definitely isn't a movie for the nine-and-under set. And the most grievous change made in the movie for me was the addition of a budding romance between Susan and Caspian. This felt awkward, unnecessary, and forced (though it generated some great jokes, I'll admit). One of the things I appreciate so much about the Narnia books is that they were written in a much more innocent time and about children who didn't have romance on their minds all the time. I appreciate romance in my movies and books if it's well-done and believable, but Susan and Caspian's relationship was neither. Narnia is supposed to be a child's world, full of light and dark and beauty and magic, not hormones and romance. It's especially irritating because Caspian is going to meet his *wife* in the very next movie, so why do we even *need* he and Susan to have a ""connection""?

Other than those small issues, this movie is magical. Bring on Voyage of the Dawn Treader!",1228435200,3,2955,4.569811320754717
1610894,5,B00005JPH2,"Narnia is back, but it feels more like the Dark Ages in England than like the magical land full of wonder and innocence that we were introduced to in the previous movie. I was puzzled by the change, as the children were when they were summoned back by Prince Caspian. Gradually, however, the reason for the darkness cast over Narnia became clear: This is what happens when fallen man takes the throne. The children, assuming Asland was gone forever, make a pact with Caspian and the few Narnians remaining alive to fight for the freedom of Narnia and Caspian's lost crown. Through perilous battles, one right after another, they find out almost too late that they can't do it alone. Asland returns to save them and restore peace, but only when they understand he is their only hope.",1228435200,,782,4.673913043478261
1610895,4,B00005JPH2,"The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian is an adventure-fantasy-thriller movie sequel to the classic Disney hit The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.  The movie begins with young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) being driven from his kingdom by his evil uncle, who kills Caspian's father to take over as king.

As Caspian flees, he stumbles upon the land of Narnia and blows the horn that sounds the call for the Pevensie siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, along with the mighty Aslan.  Along with their new hero, the four siblings return to the enchanted land of Narnia full of mystical creatures and character-filled natural elements.  They stir up the Narnians to enage the evil king and restore Prince Caspian to his throne.

The C.S. Lewis realm of fantasy and adventure continues in the second installment of the Narnia series.  The imagination, character, and charm of his writing combined with the ""Magical World"" of Disney creates an epic masterpiece sure to appeal to families.  The movie is a bit rough at times for little kids (thus the PG-rating) but ultimately it is pretty family-friendly.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching Prince Caspian.  C.S. Lewis truly has the magic for creating clever characters with unique appeal.  The movie is captivating, somewhat in the same vein as Lord of the Rings.  There are classic battle scenes, humorous moments brought on by sword-wielding mice and other talking varments.  The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian is a nice sequel to a classic Disney flick.

I just loved this film and how the characters came together at the end to fight the Talmarians.  There were a few bothering scenes as when Caspian and Peter would fight, but Susan's character was great.  At one point it reminded me of Legolas fighting and Lucy looks so grown up and her character's growth from the first film is very nicely done. Edmund fights more in this film and he's also great, his character comes full circle as you'll see and the horse shots were some of my favorites as well.

Now ""Prince Caspian"", does not follow the book of the same name as loyally as the first did. Instead we dig in much deeper into the depression of Narnia and get a few spectacular battle scenes. This film is a lot darker and less magical than the first, it is however so much more meaningful.

Clearly this movie breaks out from the clean cut ""the Lion, With & the Wardrobe"". It crosses territory only ""Lord of The Rings"" had before and it proves to be an excellent effort. As a sequel it's good but on a stand-alone its classic.

1610931,4,B00005JPH2,"In the centuries since we were last in Narnia, things have changed.  The Telmarines have overrun the country, sending the real Narnias (you know, the talking animals and mythological creatures) into hiding.  The country is currently under the rule of King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) until his nephew, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) is old enough.  But on the night that Miraz's son is born, Caspian flees and goes into hiding.  In great danger, he blows the ancient horn of help.

Meanwhile, in our world, only a year has passed for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley).  They are waiting for a train when they are suddenly called somewhere else.  At first, they don't realize where they are, but it doesn't take long for them to realize they are once again in Narnia.  Only years have past since their first visit since the castle around them in is ruins.

When they learn of the plight of the true Narnias and Caspian, they set out to join forces and free the country.  But with Aslan (voiced again by Liam Neeson) long gone, what can four children and a prince do?

Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  They royally changed the story here.  And as someone who has never been fond of this book in the series, I will say that many of the changes were for the better.  They cut much of the first half of the book, which is the slowest part of the story.  They made the battles (yes, they added one) more epic.

But not all the changes were beneficial.  The movie felt more like a retread of the first, something I've never felt before.  Peter here is moody and touchy, not the leader he is.  That sub-plot and the theme of faith vs. reason and power are never fully developed but glossed over for the battle sequences.  And let's not forget the romantic sub-plot that felt forced but harmless to me.

There is one major change I thought I wouldn't like.  It expands on a scene from the book and sends the characters further down a path of darkness.  Some will find it scary and upsetting, but I think it worked and was one of the better examples of the theme.

For anyone disappointed by the battles in the first movie, you'll be happy to hear this one makes up for it.  The battles are epic and gorgeously choreographed.  Couple those with the wonderful special effects we have become spoiled with, and you've got a great feast for the eyes.

But I digress.  I was discussing the book versus the movie. I reread parts of the book after I saw the movie.  Yes, they changed the story, but they also include some great lines from the book.  Ultimately, they made a good movie. Even with the changes, the movie never overcomes the fact that the story is essentially straight forward and weak.  But I like this version better than the book.  (Is an avid reader allowed to admit that?)

Having made that confession, I will list my biggest disappointment.  Trumpkin the Dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the Mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard) are not given enough time to develop here.  What is here is wonderful.  But these two characters are one of the redeeming features of the book for me, so I wanted to see more.

Ultimately, I really did enjoy this film.  I was drawn into the world, the characters, and their struggle.  I laughed multiple times and was moved to tears as well. It was a great escape film with some good themes to think about later.",1228262400,,3428,4.53921568627451

1610933,4,B00005JPH2,"This is an excellent film based on one of the more difficult C.S. Lewis Narnia books to translate to film. I understand how many fans of the Narnia books could be disappointed with the film. There were alterations to the storyline. However, when you read the book, you have to realize that it wouldn't translate well to film if presented as written on the page. The narration jumps back and forth and as a film it would have been too confusing. I have read all of the Narnia books and of all seven in the series, Prince Caspian is my least favorite. That is not because it isn't a good book. It stands on its own merits as a good book, but not as engaging as some of the others in the series.

This film did not do as well at the box office as the first film (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe). However, it still qualifies as a smashing success and will pave the way for the next book to be filmed.

Individuals may be unaware that C.S. Lewis' stepson Douglas Gresham is intimately involved in the production of the Narnia films. The scripts must meet his approval before they go before the camera. This film had his blessings. He is very passionate about preserving the integrity of the books. He agreed that to do the basic story justice as a film the plot had to be altered so the story could be told in a linear fashion.

A lot of talented people were involved in the making of Prince Caspian, many of whom are passionate fans of the series. The results are an epic, beautiful film that stands on its own. The acting, production, music and special effects all work together to make a film that will be loved for ages to come.

If these films continue to do well at the box-office, the producers have promised to try and make all seven books into films. Some will be more difficult than others. Prince Caspian made over $500 million in worldwide box-office revenues, and in the next few months filming will begin on the next in the series: The Voyage of the Dawntreader. That book is one of my favorites of the Narnia books. It will be directed by Michael Apted.

1610935,5,B00005JPH2,"These two movies are a lot of fun. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings, you will enjoy these 2 films. Much like LOTR.....this is a fantasy/sci-fi adventure that has lots of great characters, beautiful landscapes, and enough action to satisfy everyone. Being that this is a 2 pack with both current installments together, I will give a review that covers the picture and sound quality together. They are both of the highest quality for Blu-Ray. Disney really has their stuff together.

First off....the picture on both titles is top notch. Both titles have beautiful landscape shots, mountains, rivers, snow landscapes, massive rolling hills with awesome detail. These films use so much color, from brightly lit skies to the icey landscapes of winter. All of the uniforms have beautiful color and detail. You can see the most intricate details of each character, from the facial features to the buttons on their unoforms. The whites are super bright and clean without blooming. The blacks are deep and dark all throughout the movie. The dark scenes hold up very, very well. The daytime scenes are beautiful in their full scope. The fleshtones are spot on without a waxey appearance. The picture is alway's in focus, even the background shows off great depth and detail. Simply put.....this is why Blu-Ray has come along. Superior to any format to date. Watching the armies come together on the green rolling hills with the banners looks fantastic!

Next....the audio. This soundtrack is awesome. The voices are crisp and clean. Without any distractions of any kind. The surround sound is amazing. All of your speakers will get a great workout from start to finish. The rear speakers get plenty of use, lots of action during the battle scenes. Arrows shoot by with great sound effects. The subwoofer gets into the mix as well. During action/battle scenes, it really gets rolling with plenty of boooming sounds that add so much to the audio experience. If you have a nice reciever with a 5.1 speaker system, you will be very pleased with this soundtrack. I really cant think of a single complaint with either of these titles. Top notch video, awesome soundtrack, lots of extras to keep you busy if your into supplements.

Simply put......a 5 of 5 on picture and sound. Both disks have plenty of extras as well. With this Amazon deal including both film for under $40....you cant go wrong if your a fan. Saving $10 on both is nice also. A must but for any fan of this series.

1610936,3,B00005JPH2,"While the first movie in this series ran fairly true to the book, this movie was a big jump away, seeming more like a children's Lord of the Rings. Much, much darker than the book, filled with angst-ridden teens (not in the book), an Aslan who is conspicuous by his absence for most of the movie (also not in the book), an unlikely battle (which was not in the book) which left a foolish, hot-headed Peter having to strand Narnians inside the castle to be slaughtered (as if the real Peter would have done that!), dour dwarves (who in the book were cheerful and cheeky). . .the list goes on. Probably the most admirable characters are Edmund and Lucy. The others just tend to fight amongst themselves a lot (although Peter's fight scene with Miraz is pretty cool :^)).

That said, it's not actually a bad movie. It's clean, with no swearing or sex scenes/innuendoes, and if there are a lot of battles, at least there's hardly any blood. If you haven't read the book--or maybe just don't care whether it follows the book or not--then you will probably enjoy this movie.",1228262400,2,1068,4.5625
1610977,4,B00005JPH2,"I just finished watching Prince Caspian for the second time and enjoyed it just about as much as the first as the dvd doesn't disappoint.

Prince Caspian picks up many years after the events of the first Narnia and many things have changed indeed. Humans have taken over Narnia and run off all the creatures and magical beings, leaving the land in a darkened and dreary state. Prince Caspian is heir to the throne but is threatened by his uncle who has been coveting it for himself and his newborn son. Caspian must flee to the forest to save any hope for his future rule and the Narnian's whom he's only thought to be myths and legends up until now. The children from the first Narnia are somewhat accidentally but fortunately summoned back to a very different land than they left which is in desperate need of their help. Conflict ensues between all these characters who are all at once thrown together but eventually find a common ground against a common foe. Can the Prince survive to take hold of his royal birthright? What of the returning kings and queens of old, where will they fit in to this land that used to be their own? Will Alsan the Lion return to help save what's left of the few remaining Narnian's and help them gain their stolen freedom?

It's a much more mature and serious film than the first one. I still like The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, but Prince Caspian does what a sequel should by upping the ante and increasing the intesity. I was very suprised at the overall dark and bleak tone of the film. You really get a sense of gloom that's darkened what used to be a vibrant and colorful Narnia. I thought all the characters and voice acting was excellent. Nothing about this felt childish or remedial. This one works on all levels and makes for a perfect family movie as it has something for everyone without straying too far in one directon or the other. A perfect balance is struck for everyone to find something they like. We're introduced to many new characters but we're not overwhelmed where we have to try to keep up so as to not get lost later in the film. That seems to be something that many films have fumbled with but Prince Caspian is easy to follow and the story stays focused. There are many wonderful action and battle scenes that toe the line perfectly as they're serious but not gruesome or gory. The landscapes are gorgeous as they're all shot on location and the CGI characters blend in well, are very detailed but not distracting. Prince Caspian accomplished something that many films can't or don't bother to by taking us to a beautiful far away land that'll stick with you and make you want to go back after it's ended. That's a real testament in movie making. I had a great time in Narnia and look forward to going back again.

There are a few things here and there that you could nit pick at if you wanted to but you'd only ruin a good time for yourself. Besides, it's a fantasy film so it should be allowed some more liberties than most movie genres. I had to remind myself of that when I caught a few things that stretched reality, but then I told my brain to shut up and just enjoy it and I did.

The video on the disc is clean and clear of any specks or dirt. The day scenes are bright and colorful and the night scenes were fairly dark but not to the point where I found it difficult at all to keep up with what was going on. You can turn the lights down without turning them off and be fine. There are quite a few of the night scenes so it's good they weren't nearly as bad as I've seen on alot of films. The detail was ok, if a little soft at times but everything was discernable. They could've probably done better but what's here is just fine. The DD 5.1 mix is excellent. The speech, orchestral score and sound effects were perfectly balanced and very involving. The action scenes never got too loud to where you felt you needed to turn it down, nor the quiet talking to where you needed to turn it up. There are also some great sound effects from wind, leaves, water, creature noises and the clashing and clanging of armored battle. I also picked up some discrete rumbling and low bass during calmer moments that caught me off guard but were a nice suprise.

Prince Caspian is a very well done movie for all ages and all I can think is what a good thing that is. In these days of raunchy comedies, swear filled action movies, gory horror movies and sex scenes in just about everything, it's refreshing to see an innocent and well done live action(mostly) movie for the whole family to be able to sit and enjoy together. I hope more movie studios catch on to this and give families more reasons to go back to the movies together. Don't miss this one.",1228176000,,4718,4.375142531356898

1610979,5,B00005JPH2,"I absolutely adored this movie! As the other reviewers mentioned, it is a little darker and violent than the first, so be a little more careful with the little ones. I have an 8 year old nephew that liked the Lion Witch and the Wardrobe, but didn't like the ""scary violence"". I'll talk to his mom (my sister) and she'll make the final decision.

1610980,2,B00005JPH2,"In the very slim chance that Disney reads these reviews, I'd like to pile on to other criticisms in the hope that the Dawn Treader doesn't make the same mistakes.  As a huge C.S. Lewis and Narnia fan, I was so disappointed in Caspian.  Same reasons as many other reviewers: too many unnecessary liberties taken; little dialogue, so very little way to connect with and enjoy the characters; too grim; etc.  At the end of the movie, I felt like I didn't get to spend any time with the characters b/c most of the movie was some sort of battle.

Sure, there were a few good things.  Reepicheep was great; so was the DLF.  The scenery and landscapes were beautiful.  Some of the battles (or parts of battles) were enjoyable and had a sense of honor and bravery.  But that's about it.  Caspian was okay, a little boring.  The posturing between Peter and Caspian was silly, as was the flicker of romance between Caspian and Susan.  Not enough of Aslan.  Not enough of Lucy.  No lessons. Nothing anywhere near the charm of Mr. Tumnus.

You know how at the end of some movies (good ones) you have that feeling like you want more of a good thing?  You wish the movie would go on and on?  (That's why I ripped through all the Narnia books in the first place.)  Well, after watching Caspian, I had a feeling of wanting more of what I knew existed in the book but didn't come through in the movie...it was a yearning for what could have been instead of what was delivered.  It was a huge disappointment and a real shame.  And I truly hope the Dawn Treader can deliver what the first movie did, and what the books all do....a real connection to the characters and a reason to start thinking about what it means to believe in something and to stand up for your beliefs.  I don't think that notion is incompatible with making a block-buster of a movie.",1227571200,159,1836,4.3916913946587535
1610981,5,B00005JPH2,"Although it didn't do as well as the first installment,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000E8M0WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, I found this movie to be just as good, albeit a little darker than its predecessor. This time around, the Pevensie children are whisked unexpectedly back to Narnia when Prince Caspian summons them via a magic horn; however, 1300 years have passed from their last visit. Aslan the Lion has been missing, so it is up to the Pevensies to restore Narnia to its former glory since The Telmarines seized it, forcing the animals into hiding from the evil Miraz.

This film is not only darker, but even slightly more violent, and should be watched with caution by very young children (if at all). The previous cast returns; the standout for me is Georgie Henley as Lucy. Some child actors become more self-conscious and less natural as they age; in her case, she has only improved and shows the proper mix of innocence and maturity that is required of her character. As Susan, Anna Popplewell shows a flair for comedy in her slight romance with Prince Caspian. There are nice touches linked from the previous story, especially with how Edward is able to vanquish ""a problem"" from the previous story that he was once spellbound by.

Onto the extras and specs! The movie is presented in 2:40:1 ratio, with 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48khz/24 bit); the extras on the blu-ray are also presented in Hi-Def (1080) with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound. Needless to say, the picture and sound are fantastic on this one!

Blu-ray Disc 1 Extras:

* Circle-Vision Interactive: Creating The Castle Raid. Through HDRI camera technology the Disney team allows viewers to take a 360-degree look behind the scenes of the castle raid sequence. First, start off in the CIRCLE-VISION preview lobby, and choose to get a private tour of the castle raid from Director Andrew Adamson, Producer Mark Johnson, or a number of other key filmmakers and artists. Then, select one of the exclusive CIRCLE-VISION experiences to be virtually transported to the set in the Czech Republic. You'll be able to turn in any direction to explore how this sequence was created through progression reels, developmental animatics, 13 audio commentaries, pop-up facts, slide shows, and behind-the-scenes footage with cast and crew.

* Enhanced Disney's BD-Live Network exclusives, interactive Narnia game, downloadable features and more.

* Audio commentary with Director Andrew Adamson and the actors

Disc 2 Extras:

* Inside Narnia: The Adventure Returns (34:38). Director Adamson and crew journey back to Narnia a second time. Having already got one film under his belt with this crew, Adamson discusses how it was easier not to have to re-create a camaraderie this time around. Obviously, there was also some sadness at the end of the shoot, especially for the characters who will not be part of future installments.

* Sets of Narnia: A Classic Comes to Life (23:35). Locations around the globe and the challenges of inclement weather; lots of unexpected rain!

* A Big Movie Comes to a Small Town (23:13). A very interesting little featurette on the town of Bovec in Slovenia. Featuring interviews with townspeople young and old (96!), it details the (positive) impact that the film crew of 1200 had on this beautiful municipality. Film dailies were actually screened in Bovec's fire department!

* Previsualizing Narnia (10:03). Storyboards have gone high-tech, as much of the movie was conceptualized in what is referred to as ""pre-vis."" Using computer animation that is rough (think primitive video arcade game), the crew is able to time the movie, work out rough spots, and sell a sequence. Hand-drawn storyboards are still used at times though, especially since they are much faster to render.

* Talking Animals & Walking Trees: The Magical World of Narnia (4:43)

* Deleted Scenes (11:17) with intros by Director Adamson. Most of these 10 scenes were cut for pacing, and rightfully so. Still interesting to watch.

* Bloopers (3:04). Most of the time I skip the bloopers, but it is great to see the fun interaction between the actors, especially the Pevensie children, who laugh, cut-up, and dance in-between takes. Especially impressive is William Moseley (Peter) in a sword fight, falling down a flight of stone steps, and continuing right on with his duel after he lands!

* Secrets of the Duel (6:41) is about the duel between Peter and Miraz. The attention to detail (including the armour) is astounding, and this featurette delves into all of the intricacies of this sequence.

* Becoming Trumpkin (4:46). Peter Dinklage transforms from a Hollywood actor into Trumpkin. The ordeal of having a face mask cast in latex is shown here. Ugh! Despite all of the heavy makeup, fellow cast members repeatedly talk about Peter's expressive eyes and how much they add to the character.

* Warwick Davis: The Man Behind Nikabrik (11:11). His day begins at 4:37am in the Czech Republic for this featurette, followed by THREE HOURS in the makeup chair. Not very glamorous! And when it comes time to remove the makeup, as Warwick says, ""It isn't like Mrs. Doubtfire!""

Overall, this is a must-have set, and an excellent movie. I sure hope they continue on with the series.",1227571200,6,6696,5.147329650092081
1610982,5,B00005JPH2,"First off, I'll comment on the spread of the reviews.  The higher star rating, the more votes, which means more like it than dislike it.  On the other hand, the dispersement of votes shows that it was not an overwhelming fan favorite.  I suggest for that reason that you do not take this review by itself in deciding whether to purchase this.

Let me give the basics.  It is based on the second of C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia.  It has been over 20 years since I read this one, but from my memory this movie was not as faithful to the original as the first of the series was.  A lot of those changes were effective for a movie.  However, I think there was a little more romance than in the book, and more dealing with vengeance.

There were two great lessons in the book.  One of them, dealing with Reepicheep (who stole the show, even though he's just a . . . sorry, my thought was not very original), was intact (after you see the movie or read the book, you'll notice the irony of the word ""intact"").  The other was juggled in the plot and lost the strength it had in the book.

The special effects were great.  My favorite was the shot of an arrow speeding through the air that looked like the arrow was standing still with the background moving.

Can you take your kids with you to this movie?  Sure, but I think they would have enjoyed ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" better.",1227571200,3,1394,4.267175572519084
1610983,1,B00005JPH2,"Warning you up front there may be what people would consider a spoiler or two within this review.

After watching the original movie, ""the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" I had high expectations for the movie. Especially after I read the book and saw how well they had adapted it into movie form. I even went out and bought the entire Narnian series so that I could read the story before hand and have an idea of the movie plot.
...
...
...
What happened? It was as though they took the characters and a few chunks of the story and slapped it together in hopes of making a decent movie. And let me tell you, they failed, quite miserably. The way that they changed important pieces of the plot frustrated me, while other story lines were nearly left out altogether (For instance, they only hint at the part of the book where Lucy sees Aslan and eventually follows him despite the others protest. Then one-by-one the others begin to see him. I have always thought that to be one of the more significant plots of Prince Caspian). And then, then they add senseless plots like when they decided to invade the castle. Though admittedly  Peter did ""need"" that part of the movie to wake him up.

Which brings me to the other major part of the movie that just annoyed me to no end. They made Peter an absolute jerk. He and Caspian were never rivals, and Peter NEVER had any intent to take over/rule/or give orders to Caspian. He essentially saw Caspian as the leader because he would be once they won the battle. Oh, and don't get me started on that ridiculous  ""potential romance"" thing they had between Susan and Caspian (how was that even remotely necessary?)

There were few redeeming qualities of this movie, but they still did exist. I did like the fact that when the witch was summoned (though this technically never happened)Edwin was the one to ""destroy"" her. It was a nice touch of irony. And then there was the rat and dwarf, who's names escaped me at the moment, which made the movie bearable to sit through. And, that's about it.

I might have enjoyed this movie had I not read the book in advance, but I'll never know. I guess if you haven't read the actual story then you could potentially think it once of the best movies of all time. But I definitely would not recommend this to someone who read and loved the book, it'll probably annoy you just as much as it annoyed me.

I'd also like to note something else - I saw this movie twice. This was only because I was giving it the benefit of the doubt. I thought that perhaps going in a second time without those high expectations would make the movie more enjoyable. Sadly, it did not.",1227571200,65,2644,4.42798353909465
1610984,4,B00005JPH2,"For several years, fantasy films were MIA, except the occasional hack job.

Then Peter Jackson's glorious ""Lord of the Rings"" came and went, leaving some pretty big shoes to fill, as far as fantasy films go. And while ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" and its grittier sequel ""Prince Caspian"" don't quite fill those shoes, they come a lot closer than any movie has since. Andrew Adamson brings C.S. Lewis's classic fantasy novels to life with plenty of beauty, drama and solid acting.

With WW II raging, the four Pevensie children are sent to the countryside, at an eccentric professor's mansion. But during a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) hides inside a wardrobe -- and stumbles into a wintry wilderness, with a faun she befriends. Alas, her brothers and sisters don't believe her -- but they don't know that Edmund (Skandar Keynes) has also gone through, and befriended a sinister, beautiful Witch (Tilda Swinton).

Eventually all four end up going through the wardrobe, but but they soon find that the Witch is hunting for them, in fear that they will fulfil an ancient prophecy. But Edmund has run off to join the Witch. And so the remaining three must join up with Aslan (Liam Neeson), the leonine god-king of Narnia. But the price for victory against the Witch may be too high.

And then we have the drastically different story of ""Prince Caspian"" -- 1,300 years later, wioth the native Narnians driven underground by human Telmarines.

When King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.

Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified by what has happened to Narnia. Caspian has organized a ramshackle army of Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. After a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian.

Director Andrew Adamson has obviously given the two Narnia films plenty of creative love, majesty and humor. This is especially difficult because the two films are rather different in style -- the first is more of a children's fantasy, and the second is a darker, grittier war story where some of the good guys won't make it out alive.

Adamson does a spectacular job bringing Narnia to life -- races across a frozen river, tea with Tumnus, the Witch's final battle with Peter, a battle interrupted by raging tree roots and castle-wide battles, as well as the more harrowing character-driven scenes like Miraz taunting his anguished nephew. All of these come to life with remarkable skill and grace. The most powerful scenes are lion-god Aslan's -- including a truly ghastly sacrifice scene that does justice to Lewis' novel.

But Adamson doesn't let it get overinflated on its own ego. When Edmund tells his horse, ""Whoa, boy!"" it retorts peevishly, ""My NAME is Philip!""; and the grimmer ""Prince Caspian"" is kept afloat by the chivalrous mouse Reepicheep. Those moments of lightness -- and giving Aslan a sense of humor -- keep the films from seeming too grim or self-important.

And of course, the special effects. WETA workship deserves an award (it's been nominated for a few) for the amazing CGI, ranging from Aslan (who looks almost real) to the witch's ""resurrection"" in a solid slab of ice. They are especially good in battle scenes, which are startlingly savage and brutal for younger viewers' movie.

The young actors do solid jobs here -- the four Pevensie actors do thoroughly solid jobs. The best is Georgie Henley is probably the most capable actress here, conveying misery, awe, delight, childish glee and sorrow. Tilda Swinton is pitch-perfect as the cruel White Witch, Ben Barnes is solid as handsome Prince Caspian, and Liam Neeson sounds suitably warm, kind and paternal as Aslan.

Though Lewis was reportedly against a live-action adaptation of the Chronicles, it's hard to imagine him having a problem with these rapid-fire adaptations -- the sparkling ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" and the grimier war story ""Prince Caspian.""",1227484800,15,4568,5.003952569169961

1611026,5,B00005JPH2,"This is the sequel to the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe which was an awesome movie.  I still remember when my aunty first bought me the Chronicles of Narnia book collection.  Once I started reading the first book, I couldn't stop and read the entire series in about a day and a half.  Now that Prince Caspian is out, there are only five more to go.  The next one is called Voyage of the Dawn Treader which will be just as good if not better than its predecessors.  The only junk thing is waiting for it to come out!",1227225600,,519,4.15
1611027,4,B00005JPH2,"My childhood love of books was first ignited by the Chronicles of Narnia. I was swept away into worlds fanciful, dangerous, and often layered in symbolism. Until a few years ago, I never thought films could capture what I experienced in my own imagination.

""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was a pleasant surprise. Talking animals, the faun, and the magic of the wardrobe were all brought to life with amazing detail and warmth--or, in the case of the White Witch, chill. Despite enjoying the movie, it seemed to lack a bit of the grittier side I remembered from my own reading.

""Prince Caspian"" adds that element I found missing in the first movie. Yes, it deviates from the original book quite a bit, but in all honesty, this was my least favorite book of the seven chronicles. Although liberties are taken, I believe they stay true to the heart of C.S. Lewis's writings, and they tell a stronger, more epic story. The romance element is not as heavy-handed as some have implied, and it does seem slightly forced, and yet it too seems like something possible for sons of Adam and daughters of Eve who are getting older in their Narnian roles.

From fast-paced chases, attacks, escapes, and eventually a large-scale battle with some fun effects, ""Prince Caspian"" is great entertainment. I can't wait for the release of ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" possibly my favorite of this series of books. Sure, there will be parts that challenge my own interpretation of the story, but there will be others--such as Reepicheep, in this one--that live up to and even surpass my expectations. I'm glad to see Lewis's magic brought to film.",1227139200,4,1637,4.777385159010601
1611028,2,B00005JPH2,"I know there may be plenty of critical reviews here, but I can't resist putting my thoughts in.
  I'm an avid fan of the Narnia books, I've read Prince Caspian 4 or 5 times, and I was so excited when this movie came out. About halfway into the movie however, I realized to my dismay and anger that the movie was far off course from the book itself. It had non-stop battles, there was very little conversation, the storm of the castle was completly off track and never happened. The violence was very upsetting, and I acutally thought a few of my young cousins might like this movie, but after I saw the constant war and unnessessary bloodshed, I knew my cousins could never stomach this brutality. I know this movie takes in war of course, but come on! Some of that frightening aggression was unnessessary, and never happened in the book. You can make a good war movie without overdoing the violence, people.
  The romance between Caspian and Susan I found absurd and maddening as there was no evidence of it in the book. I think C.S. Lewis would be appualled if he could see this movie, because they warped the message he really had. Lucy never learned in this film to obey Aslan above all else, and not listen to her siblings when they doubted her, and when the other kids disregarded her warnings and travled down the road they weren't attacked as they were in the book, they never learned that Lucy was right in her forewarning. They threw away the message of following Jesus instead of other people, and replaced it with senseless war and viciousness.
  I was pretty dissapointed with this movie, and I'm not buying it. To parents, I feel strongly oppossed to this movie, and I don't think your little ones will like it nor will you. Of course that is your choice to like it, but if you like a good message and a wholesome movie, avoid this one.",1226793600,16,1850,4.474777448071217
1611029,2,B00005JPH2,"As a fan of fantasy in general, if theres one franchise thats always felt artificial and fake to me, its Narnia. The wonderful books have been reduced to 'Fantasy for Dummies' here, with production values and acting befitting a late night TV Special. And not in a good way.

From the moment the movie began, I had trouble staying awake, only because it seemed to be a really uninspired rehash of the LOTR special effects, but only with less heart or interest. All of the child actors are absolutely useless. They make Macaulay Culkin look like Peter O'Toole - I'm serious. I'm sure 'deadpan' is a cinematic style and all, but these kids have taken it to a whole new level.

Oh yeah, and the talking lion was just ridiculous. Let me see, he does a 'fancy thing' with a river here, and thats supposed to be the films' big highlight? I just don't get the positive reviews for this film. It was poorly made, badly acted, with elves, dwarves, talking mice, fairies etc all thrown in just because they appeared in the book (and sometimes not even)

Of course, chances are you might just love this, but my own two cents was that it was an absolute waste of time and money. Not to mention I could have been at home fast asleep, or better still, watching reruns of ""The Nanny""

Two Generous Stars

PS : I see glowing reviews here for Ben Barnes who plays the Prince. I see him as a less gifted Jesse Metcalfe (the gardener from ""Desperate Housewives"") minus the sixpack and half-hearted charisma.",1226620800,3,1487,4.5130111524163565
1611030,2,B00005JPH2,"I gave this installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" two stars only because of the special effects.  The story really departed from the book and could have been much better had it followed the book more closely.  In the book, Prince Caspian was a young boy, NOT an adult.  The Disney folks only made him an adult so they could work in a love interest with Queen Susan.  I don't object to a love interest in a movie if it belongs.  In this case, it was totally uncalled for.  Finally, too many scenes were taken out that were in the book.  For example, Aslan's romp with Bacchus and the Mynaids.  Other scenes were substituted that were not in the book at all, such as the over-long battle scene in King Miraz's castle.

1611031,5,B00005JPH2,"I've seen a lot of movies lately, but I would have to say that ""Prince Caspian"" is one of the better ones out there.  With thrilling, absolutely dazzling music and cutting edge cinematics, this movie is on the top of my buy list.

I know that a lot of people who've read the books seemed to be put out by the changes that were made from the original story, but the fact of the matter is, we live in a different world than that of when the books were originally written, and I don't like to judge movies based off of books by the books themselves.  I like both the movie and the book for themselves, without having to relate them.

Admittedly, ""Prince Caspian"" is a much darker tone than ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", but that's to be expected when Narnia has been living under the tyranny of the Telmarins for centuries.  It's more violent, so be sure you watch who you're letting watch it, but that's what war is about.  You can't expect them to tickle each other with feathers.",1225152000,,990,4.353260869565218

1611084,4,B00005JPH2,"This review comes from my wife Sarah, who is a big fan of the first movie: The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a masterpiece. This movie didn't come close to the power of that movie. Regardless, if you're a fan of the first movie, I feel it's worth your time to view this second flick.

The first movie had such a positive, clear message of faith, love, forgiveness, standing up for what you believe in and redemption. The story along with the characters was so well developed. It had charm and depth. It was emotionally engaging.

This one was darker, with much confusion, frustration and less of a clear message to take away. There was a lot of focus on the fighting, and there were several periods in the movie that were plain disturbing rather than moving. The sets were darker also. I felt as if there was no one to like. Caspian was hard to relate to. Even the four main characters from the prior movie were less likable and more challenging to sympathize with. The ending left me entirely unsatisfied and even a bit sad. The ""romance"" between the older Pevensie girls and Prince Caspian was a bit unbelievable.

Yet, those who really enjoyed the first flick will want to see the continuation. The four Pevensie kids go back to Narnia and you'll want to follow the story. As in the first, the special effects are amazing, and the acting is top-notch. The introduction of the mouse character was enjoyable, and there were moments that made it worthwhile. While it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, it's still a decent movie. I give it a C+ or a B-.",1223769600,4,1587,4.522648083623693
1611085,5,B00005JPH2,"I watched the film ""Prince Caspian"" with much the same sentiments as when first reading the book thirty years ago. At ten years old, I so loved ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" that, after doubting that the sequel could compare, I was surprised and delighted to find an even more mysterious and exciting story. The film digresses from the book but not in a devastating way. In fact, some of the changes enhance the plot and the characters.

Again we join Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, also known as ""the Pevensies,"" as they are literally swept into another dimension. The youngsters still have a great deal to learn in the land of Narnia, where they formerly ruled as kings and queens. They do not recognize their kingdom at first, so greatly has it been altered by many centuries. The realization of what has been destroyed sweeps over them as they uncover artifacts of their own past, almost like finding relics of a lost and beloved faith. It is before the broken altar of the Stone Table that the past and present merge. The four Pevensies know that they must be ready to sacrifice themselves for the Narnia; they have a bond with the land which time and space cannot erase. As C. S. Lewis wrote: ""Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen in Narnia.""

New friends and foes replace the old, including Prince Caspian himself, dashing, disinherited and untried. He belongs to the swarthy race of the Telmarines, descended from pirates, presumably Spanish ones, who long before stumbled into Narnia. Caspian and the Pevensies help each other not only win the freedom of Narnia, but to grow in humility and perilous self-knowledge. The rivalry between Caspian and Peter and the flicker of romance between Caspian and Susan are elements which, although not in the book, are surprisingly natural in the film. However, it was a bit odd to show a slip of a girl like Susan fighting robust, armored warriors, knocking them down.

In the book, Aslan is gradually revealed to each of the main characters according to their degree of faith. The film does not do this in the same manner so when Trumpkin the dwarf finally sees Aslan the impact is lost. Indeed, Aslan is absent from most of the film and, as in the book, the heroes and heroines feel abandoned. It is a fitting allegory for the dark night of the soul experienced by those seriously struggling along in the spiritual life. Events in Narnia spiral out of control, partly through the willful behavior of the kings, who need Susan and Lucy to remind them that Someone Else is really in charge. How often we need to be reminded of the same truth.

In ""Prince Caspian"" the kings and queens triumph over the ruthless Telmarines only by allowing humility, courage, and child-like trust to conquer pride, jealousy, and the reckless desire for revenge. In the meantime, myths spring to life as prophecy is fulfilled. The reclamation of Narnia does not happen without cost, without mistakes and death. Aslan returns, traditions are reclaimed as a new kingdom is built on the foundations of the old. In Narnia as in our own world, no matter how dark it may be, good can be brought out of anything.",1223596800,9,3161,4.679856115107913

1611087,5,B00005JPH2,"I am somewhat of a purist on Lewis's ""Narnia"" series.  And I must admit I was skeptical about some of the changes I knew they were making from the book.  The first movie was made extremely well, but I also know Disney has a bad habit of making awful sequels to good movies.

I saw ""Prince Caspian"" in theatres and was totally amazed.  There were some changes to it.  As with the first movie, this one goes into much more detail about some of the things the book only touches on.  It doesn't stick quite as close to the book as ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" but the changes are made very tastefully, and most changes are minor ones made to fit with the details.

This movie continues to exhibit a great storyline, very well-written characters, and many of the things we all wanted to see on screen after reading the book.  All in all, I think this movie very much fits with Lewis's vision of Narnia, and even if you're a purist, you should give it a chance.",1222819200,3,967,4.303867403314917
1611088,5,B00005JPH2,"I have studied C.S. Lewis and his masterpiece series The Chronicles of Narnia for some time and have come to know and love these books in side out.  I feel that Disney has made an EXCELLENT adaptation of his second novel in the series, going by order published.  If you are a fan of the books the few scenes they had to cut for time are really not missed and the information gleamed from these chapters are given later. And if the viewer is not totally familiar with the book they are definitely not left confused.
Compared to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe it is much more action packed and the young stars play they parts perfectly.  My favorite character Edmund is much more like-able in this movie and has wisdom gained from his trials in the last installment is apparent.  Peter grows in this movie in his ability to give the throne over to Caspian at the end, as there were some power struggles between the two throughout the film.  The love story between Susan and Caspian nicely balances this action packed films, and though corny at times it helps move the film along.  And again we see young little faithful Lucy not being understood by her fellow siblings, except now Edmund is on her side, as she thinks she sees Aslan early on.  But her faith prevails and they are able to gain the aid of the Great Lion.
All in all, my favorite film of the year and now a new addition to my all time favorite films.",1222041600,4,1419,4.3726235741444865
1611089,3,B00005JPH2,"One of the major problems with all film series is what might be called middle filmitis. This is when films that are not first in a series rely too heavily upon an audience's memories of earlier films to inform them of the traits of characters, the chronology of prior events, and a general knowledge of the world the film series is set in. Such is the case with the latest C.S. Lewis adapted book, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Oh, yes, there are other major flaws in this film, which I shall limn, but middle filmitis is the overarching ill that infects all others. The same was not true with the first film in the series, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. When I reviewed that film I started out by stating that that film was 1) a more literate and less Byzantine Lord Of The Rings, 2) a deeper and more realistic Harry Potter, and 3) a more mature Oz.
  Well, all three claims are still true, however the series has taken a sharp downward turn toward LOTR's Byzantine darkness, Potter's shallowness, and the puerility of Oz. Prince Caspian is not a bad film, merely a passable special effects film, filled with all sorts of magical beings. Yet, part of middle filmitis creeps in right at the film's outset, when a child is born and a young man flees for his life. We know nothing of the situation, yet the film's camera work and musical score intone great drama and import into a depiction the viewer is in no way invested in. Then we see the returning children from the first film: (in ascending order of age) Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley). Yet, and here is a critical point, it takes a while for the first names of our heroes to be mentioned, thus leaving first time viewers at a loss, and the family surname is never mentioned in the whole second film.
Some critics have harped on the fact that the Telmarines are all swarthy Spanish Conquistadore types, while the kids are Anglo whitebreads, but for this criticism to have any weight there would have to be a much more nuanced approach to the characterization. All the Telmarines could have been Girl Scouts, and it would not have mattered, for they all act in such manifestly `bad guy' ways that their being swarthy Mediterraneans is an afterthought. Similarly, claims that the film relies too heavily on Christian iconography and a Colonial White Man's Burden mindset are rented by the utter shallowness of the screenplay. Christian/Schmistian- Aslan is just a magical lion, at home with any set of mythologies, not just the Christian one. Furthermore, since Adamson, as director, added story arcs the original book did not have, why did he not make some major changes to add zip to the tale? After all, Miraz is hardly a threat, and the fight scene between him and Peter is rather pathetic. meanwhile, the minute or two that the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) spends in the film, is far more intriguing. She would have been a far netter antagonist.
  Overall, The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian is still better fare- especially for children, than any of the three overblown and pompous LOTR films, but, compared to the far superior first entry in this series, it is a profound disappointment. One only hopes that Adamson can parallax the first two films and take the few things that work well in this film, and add them back to the excellence of the first film, so that the third entry, slated for 2010, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, is the best of the trio. Elsewise, fans of The Matrix will be happy that their trilogy is no longer considered the most disappointing sci fi/fantasy series Hollywood has produced.",1221782400,,3700,4.687692307692307

If that is another cute fantasy film with Disney-esque animals and wise-cracking, snogging, contemporary teenagers (""Sorted!""), plus some soft-cheesy music at the end, then this is your movie.  If you want something that Lewis might have regarded without horror and despair, this isn't it.",1221696000,15,322,5.42
1611091,2,B00005JPH2,"This is the second of Walden Media's adaptations of CS Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, helmed by the same writer-director, Andrew Adamson.  Parents of younger children will find it less child-friendly than the earlier film -- it is darker, more violent, with a more confusing plot, with older actors (far older than in the book), and a less of a focus on animal characters.  Older kids embarrassed by child-friendly material will probably call it an improvement (but without, I suspect, much more actual enjoyment).  On balance, I rate it no better than the first film - in that it is equally devoid of the charm, wit, humor, intelligence and moral perspective that can be found in the source novels, and with only a handful of inspired moments.

Adamson continues his agenda of systematically trashing Lewis' characters.  This time, Peter gets the worst of it, being portrayed as insecure, egotistical and power hungry.  The other Pevensies fare slightly better in comparison, but they are a miserable and surly lot, apparently incapable of passing up an opportunity to hurt each-other (or anyone else) with a mean-spirited jibe.  As in the first film, every crisis is an excuse for a hellish bout of finger-pointing, blame-mongering and whining.  Adamson seems scarcely able to imagine people treating each-other any other way.

That Adamson expects approval for such spitefulness is evidenced by Lucy's taunting of Trumpkin during his confrontation with Aslan (which incidentally is rather dull in comparison with the Book -- Aslan just roars at him).  This was clearly none of her business.  Had she behaved so in the book, she would surely have got a scolding from Aslan herself.

Secondary characters are trashed too.  Caspian becomes a jerk for whom revenge takes precedence over concern for his subjects.  Trumpkin the Dwarf has become a dour and charm-less bore, whose interactions with the Children are devoid of any glimmer of human warmth, and who seems scarcely distinguishable from his more-villainous counterpart, Nikabrik.  Trufflehunter is entirely forgettable, and seems more like a weasel than a badger.  The Bulgy Bears -- perhaps judged not cool enough -- are entirely absent.

It is in many ways more violent than the book, and in some way less so. I personally would not mind seeing Trumpkin decapitate the Hag, or Peter decapitate the treacherous Lord, as occurred in the book.  We are spared such sights here.  What is regrettable is not so much the level of graphic violence as the level of viciousness.  In the book, our heroes committed violent acts when necessary and justifiable, but also showed moral restraint, and concern for others, including enemies.  The film ups the level of casual, thoughtless killing, and eliminates most evidence of compassion and moral restraint.  If, by some chance, the heroes do show mercy, it is with the worst grace imaginable, as if the sole purpose of sparing an enemy's life were to humiliate him.

One example of the film's mindset is the treatment of Reepicheep.  In the BOOK, Reepicheep, the mouse warrior, was honored and respected for his courage and chivalry.  But the idea that there might be virtues other than brute strength is apparently an alien concept to Adamson, who turns the miniscule Reepicheep into a terrifying, death-dealing monster.  During battles, he flies toward human throats with the alacrity of the Monty Python's Vicious Bunny, and in one bizarre scene, single-handedly dispatches a half-dozen Telmarine soldiers.

There are many changes.  The novel had a somewhat non-linear plot, and I understand that presenting it effectively on the big screen would requires some creativity.  I agree, for instance, that starting with Caspian, and having the Pevensies appear later, is probably the best way to adapt.  Still, this could have been adapted better.  Whenever the story makes no sense, which is very frequently, you can be sure that it happened very differently in the book.  Lewis plotted his stories with care.

The best scene, I thought, was Lucy dancing with the leaves.",1221264000,18,4064,5.127659574468085
1611092,1,B00005JPH2,"This movie is absaloutley awful, the acting was so bad, it made me cringe in my seat.  This is one example where they should have completely recasted.  It was also upsetting when it decided that it wanted to be ""Lord of the Rings"" with all the screenshots and battles.  I love the books, the Chronicles of Narnia are one of my favorite series, and the previous adaptation of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" I loved, but this strayed much too far from the book.  The reason the four children slipped by with no acting ability in the first one was because their roles were not so serious.  I mean, here they are killing other human beings without even flinching!  Susan just whips out her bow and shoots trained soldiers off their horses with the nonchalance of getting out of bed! I tend to be very hard on movies.

The scenes and structure had to be changed a bit for cinematic purposes as the book in it's original wording and pace did not work well for a movie. But the story is still the same. And it's a good one.

I can sit here and spend an hour writing a review that tears the film apart bit by bit though, quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time so I will only focus on my biggest complaints.

Yes, I know it's a film for kids and that it's rated PG but where is the blood? Hundreds of people, humans and creatures alike, are felled in battle but there is not one drop of blood in the whole movie. What is this teaching our children about violence exactly? Don't give me any nonsense about traumatizing them either. I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator-Blu-ray/dp/B0012GVKW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator [Blu-ray</a>] when I was a kid and I turned out fine. But this is Disney after all and the only people keeping them afloat as a studio are overprotective mothers who fear absolutely everything and are only too happy to spend money on movies and products that falsely suggest that the world is a magical and safe place (this is what you call being 'Disneyfied') and consider something as tame and boring as Prince Caspian to be dark and tough. ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember,"" warns Aslan. Wow, does that mean that we'll be getting Rambo-level violence? Sadly, no. However, more people are killed in this film. Can you work that out? Because I can't.

Since I haven't read the book I wasn't previously orientated as to who's who and what their motivations are, and the film doesn't make it any clearer I promise you. Far, far too often I found myself asking 'Who is he?', 'Who are they?', 'Why are all the bad guys identical to each other?', 'Why are they the bad guys again?'. 'What do they want?'. 'Why are they all Spanish?', 'Why are the kids still kids? Shouldn't they return to Narnia as adults?' And so on...and so on...

The only thing this film is good for is a cure for insomnia. I know that's a childish and crass and far from being a clever soundbite but it was so catatonic that it simply is not inspiring an intelligent review out of me.

Whatever charm&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Blu-ray/dp/B000YAFJXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray</a>] had is well and truly gone, all that's left is some pretty scenery and that's not enough to keep me interested for well over two hours.

1611125,4,B00005JPH2,"Imagine finding a magical kingdom in another world... only to return over a thousand years later, and find it in ruins.

That's the whole idea of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,"" a superb sequel to ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" While it has a climax that goes on WAY too long, this movie shows us the darker side of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world -- with a heavy dose of Shakespearean villains, political intrigue, and some spectacularly epic battles.

It's been 1,300 years in Narnia, and the human Telmarines have invaded and driven the native Narnians underground. Aslan hasn't been seen in centuries.

And when King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.

Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified when they find that their once-idyllic land has been nearly destroyed. Caspian has been organizing a ramshackle army of native Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. And after a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian....

""Prince Caspian"" is definitely a darker story than its predecessor -- good guys die, coups fail, evil machinations succeed, the castles are grimy, some of the good guys turn bad for real, and a bleak, hopeless feeling suffuses much of the movie's second half. Even our heroes have to deal with their doubts and anger, especially since Aslan is conspicuously absent for 95% of the entire film.

And if the first film was a colorful fantasy adventure, then this one is a military story with all the necessary action trappings -- spectacular aerial drops, castle-wide massacres, and a spectacular finale involving a massive pit, tree roots, a river, and catapults. But Adamson also packs in as much violence as a PG-rated movie can contain -- while there's only a few drops of actual gore, there's plenty of beheadings, shootings and stabbings.

But Narnia itself has lost none of its charm, and Adamson lingers lovingly on the sunlit forests and quiet rivers for as long as he can. And though the story is grim, he sprinkles it with plenty of humor (the bound-and-gagged cat) and fairly snappy dialogue. One of the most spectacular scenes involves a very familiar character speaking from inside a sheet of shimmering ice, as Caspian is dragged into a necromancer's ritual. It's really rather creepy.

Problems with the movie? Well, the climactic battle drags on for a LONG time, and every time you think it'll end, it revs back up. And those masked soldiers are a wee bit too reminiscent of ""300's"" Persians.

The four Pevensie actors all do solid jobs, although William Moseley is the standout -- Peter is struggling with doubt and a bit of alpha rivalry, especially since he's used to being Narnia's top dog. Barnes starts off a little stiffly -- come on, where's the fear when you see your bed turned into a pincushion? -- but soon grows into the difficult role of a Hamlet-like prince who is struggling to become both a Narnian friend and a Telmarine king.

But there's a pretty brilliant supporting cast as well: Castellitto is simply outstanding as the ruthless, icy-cold Miraz, as are Damin Alczar and Pierfrancesco Favino as his scheming advisors. Warwick Davis does a low-key, malevolent turn as Nikabrik, while Peter Dinklage is the likably brusque, cynical Trumpkin. And Eddie Izzard is top-notch as the mousy swashbuckler Reepicheep -- this could have a silly, comic-relief character, but he does end up being both adorable and formidable.

There are going to be two versions of the ""Prince Caspian"" release in either blu ray or regular versions. The more embellish DVD version basically has the film, plus an extra bonus disc with the stuff you'd expect in such a movie: bloopers, deleted scenes, and a series of featurettes about the making of the movie -- previsualization, fight choreography, sets, special effects, and the guys who play the dwarves Trumpkin and Nikabrik. As for the third disk, it's going to be a downloadable digital version of the movie.

""Prince Caspian"" drops the children's fantasy feeling, in favor of a darker, more militaristic story -- especially with all that father-murder stuff. But despite its darker overtones, it never forgets the light side.",1219968000,9,4819,5.002496878901373
1611126,5,B00005JPH2,"This movie is amazing! I've read the books, luv them, and the story is followed very well. The original books are fantastic fairy tales of other worlds and mythical creatures, but the movie takes the 1 dimensional story and gives it life. It gives charcter to the characters, who in the book are a little flat. They lack personality, don't struggle with right and wrong, and don't really have disagreements. like i said, the book is a fairy tale, and is written as fairy tales are.
  *SPOILERS BELOW!!!*
  In the movie, there is the added power struggle between caspian and peter, the romance between caspian and susan, the advancement of edmund by bringing him from simply being the younger brother to a young man who can handle himself without the help of his older siblings. And of course don't forget lucy, who has grown up quite a bit from the last movie but even after all they've bin through, she still faces the dilemma of being treated as an ignorant child.
  If you want to compare the pevensies of the lion the witch and the wardrobe against to those of prince caspian, there are some significant changes. peter as grown used to his role as high king, and is a bit focused on having the power and being leader. Susan has matured in that she is now a useful person to have around in a fight. In the first movie she is involved with aslan at the stone table and misses most of the battle, but in this movie, she gets in the midst of the battle, fighting alongside the boys. Edmund has also grown up a lot. In the first movie he is mostly seen in peters shadow after he joins aslans side of the war. in this movie, he has a swordfight one-on-one where he shows his skill as a swordsman. Later he shows more of his prowess as a warrior during the raid on miraz's castle.lucy, a main focus in the first movie, being the person who discovers the land in the closet, is now older, but unlike the others, her faith in aslan is still very much alive. she is the person who rediscovers him, and brings him the the front of the battle.
  The actors in this movie are very convincing, and while watching, pay attention to the music. it is very good and gives emotion to every scene. Speaking as a girl, i also feel the need to point out that the actors are not half bad to look at. just throwing that out there... :)",1219881600,4,2315,4.342592592592593

It is a year since the Pevensey children were in Narnia, all are on their way back to boarding school, when they are pulled back into a world that they think they only left a year ago.

However over 1000 years have passed in Narnia, they as the children of Adam have long been forgotten and for the moment their is no sign of Aslan.

Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are destined to fight for Narnia once more, but this time to put Prince Caspian on the throne, as his evil uncle wants to kill him and ensure that his son, only recently born will take over after him as regent.

Peter at 16 years of age is an angry young man who is trying to find his place in the world, having been an adult for so long and then having to make the transition back to childhood, he is confused and resentful, he makes some misguided decisions which results in the death of many Narnians and only Lucy and Peter  seem to have a grasp of what must be done, for even their old sister Susan is struggling to deal with her won losses, which include her childhood and the fact she will never return to Narnia.

There are fantastic special effects, amazing battle sequences and some truly great characters, Peter Dinklage as the gruff but kindly dwarf Trumpkin is especially likable, and Warick Davies shakes off his good hearted Willow image when he turns into a Narnian who wants the ice queen back on the throne and tempts Prince Caspian to bring her back in order for him to have a powerful ally in the forthcoming battle.

1611129,4,B00005JPH2,"Imagine finding a magical kingdom in another world... only to return over a thousand years later, and find it in ruins.

That's the whole idea of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,"" a superb sequel to ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" While it has a climax that goes on WAY too long, this movie shows us the darker side of C.S. Lewis' fantastical world -- with a heavy dose of Shakespearean villains, political intrigue, and some spectacularly epic battles.

It's been 1,300 years in Narnia, and the human Telmarines have invaded and driven the native Narnians underground. Aslan hasn't been seen in centuries.

And when King Miraz's (Sergio Castellitto) wife gives birth to a baby boy, his nephew -- the rightful heir -- becomes an obstacle. Young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees from his treacherous uncle, and is discovered by a band of Narnians. Along the way, he accidentally ends up summoning the ancient Kings and Queens of Narnia -- also known as the Pevensie children, who were waiting at a train station when they were unexpectedly sucked trough a tunnel.

Though initially delighted to have returned to Narnia, the Pevensies are horrified when they find that their once-idyllic land has been nearly destroyed. Caspian has been organizing a ramshackle army of native Narnians, but Peter (William Moseley) finds that fighting an organized, armed force is very different from battling the White Witch. And after a disastrous attack, the Narnians are facing almost certain destruction -- but Lucy (Georgie Henley) is convinced that Aslan can somehow save them, and restore the kingdom to Prince Caspian....

""Prince Caspian"" is definitely a darker story than its predecessor -- good guys die, coups fail, evil machinations succeed, the castles are grimy, some of the good guys turn bad for real, and a bleak, hopeless feeling suffuses much of the movie's second half. Even our heroes have to deal with their doubts and anger, especially since Aslan is conspicuously absent for 95% of the entire film.

And if the first film was a colorful fantasy adventure, then this one is a military story with all the necessary action trappings -- spectacular aerial drops, castle-wide massacres, and a spectacular finale involving a massive pit, tree roots, a river, and catapults. But Adamson also packs in as much violence as a PG-rated movie can contain -- while there's only a few drops of actual gore, there's plenty of beheadings, shootings and stabbings.

But Narnia itself has lost none of its charm, and Adamson lingers lovingly on the sunlit forests and quiet rivers for as long as he can. And though the story is grim, he sprinkles it with plenty of humor (the bound-and-gagged cat) and fairly snappy dialogue. One of the most spectacular scenes involves a very familiar character speaking from inside a sheet of shimmering ice, as Caspian is dragged into a necromancer's ritual. It's really rather creepy.

Problems with the movie? Well, the climactic battle drags on for a LONG time, and every time you think it'll end, it revs back up. And those masked soldiers are a wee bit too reminiscent of ""300's"" Persians.

The four Pevensie actors all do solid jobs, although William Moseley is the standout -- Peter is struggling with doubt and a bit of alpha rivalry, especially since he's used to being Narnia's top dog. Barnes starts off a little stiffly -- come on, where's the fear when you see your bed turned into a pincushion? -- but soon grows into the difficult role of a Hamlet-like prince who is struggling to become both a Narnian friend and a Telmarine king.

But there's a pretty brilliant supporting cast as well: Castellitto is simply outstanding as the ruthless, icy-cold Miraz, as are Damin Alczar and Pierfrancesco Favino as his scheming advisors. Warwick Davis does a low-key, malevolent turn as Nikabrik, while Peter Dinklage is the likably brusque, cynical Trumpkin. And Eddie Izzard is top-notch as the mousy swashbuckler Reepicheep -- this could have a silly, comic-relief character, but he does end up being both adorable and formidable.

There are going to be two versions of the ""Prince Caspian"" release in either blu ray or regular versions. The more embellish DVD version basically has the film, plus an extra bonus disc with the stuff you'd expect in such a movie: bloopers, deleted scenes, and a series of featurettes about the making of the movie -- previsualization, fight choreography, sets, special effects, and the guys who play the dwarves Trumpkin and Nikabrik. As for the third disk, it's going to be a downloadable digital version of the movie.

I loved this movie from start to end.  I'm 23 years old, and I have read the Narnia books, and I thought this adaptation blew the book out of the water!  EXCELLENT!  The director really knew what he was doing on this movie.  I loved the first movie, but this one is much much better.
There is a lot of action scenes that are done very well, and are very breath taking whenever you see the different creatures in Narnia in battle.
There is plenty of comedy, action, adventure, and also a love story.  It has a little bit of everything.  I don't think they are going to beat this movie with the other ones however.  I think this is Narnia at its best.",1217808000,,830,4.262820512820513
1611132,2,B00005JPH2,"... which is not meant as a compliment.

I love the Narnia books, and enjoyed the first movie. Just saw ""Caspian"" last night with my daughter (she for the second time).

I tend to agree with people who gave this 1 or 2 stars ... boring ... too violent, yet strangely bloodless ... characters made choices that seemed to make no sense... I often found myself thinking, ""Wait. Now why is s/he doing that?"".

Given that, I'd like to add my ...

RANDOM THOUGHTS:

Not only was this movie dark (in the sense of violent), I found it to be just plain dark (as in hard to see). The beginning scene and the raid on the castle were too dark for me to see parts of it.

I was bored.

The young man who played Prince Caspian was apparently trying to channel Antonio Banderas. The accent was not needed.

At almost 2.5 hours, ""Caspian"" was far too long and boring.

Peter is the High King. He lives a grown up life in Narnia. Now we see him back in London, yearning not to be ""treated like a kid"" (or words to that effect). He returns to Narnia, only to constantly act like a wounded adolesent, getting into (pardon the expression) p*ssing matches with Prince Caspian time and time again.

The young woman who played Queen Susan appears to be a foul mood most of the movie, which is too bad as she seems like a capable actress.

The machismo especially seemed very opposite of the spirit of C.S. Lewis' writings. (Note to script writer: If you're going for the macho look, at least make it consistent. A Peter who couldn't handle a high school brawl suddenly turns into a killing machine on the field of battle?!? That made NO sense ...)

The movie became considerably less boring once I realized I was watching ""Lord of the Rings for Kids,"" which gave me something to look for in the movie. There were so many scenes stolen from the LOTR trilogy that Peter Jackson should have been on the payroll. If you have to watch this movie, you can entertain yourself by asking, ""What scene from LOTR are they stealing now?"" throughout the movie. You'll be surprised what you come up with.

Queen Susan needs to be rescued by Prince Caspian? Please. This is the 21st century!

THE BRIGHT SIDE ...

CASPIAN wasn't as bad as THE GOLDEN COMPASS.

I'm a big Eddie Izzard fan, but I wasn't sure his voice was right for Reepicheep. I was wrong. Eddie Izzard was awesome! In the more boring moment of the movie, I found myself wanting more Reepicheep on screen. (Or maybe I was rooting for him to stab either Peter or Caspian ... or both). Go Eddie!

The young lady who plays Lucy continues to be a delight to watch. She's quite talented. I look for big things from her as she grows as an actress.

All in all, I'd suggest skipping this movie. Even the BBC version is better.",1217808000,9,2746,4.382642998027613
1611133,5,B00005JPH2,"Andrew Adamson and the team who produced ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" have surpassed themselves this time. All four of the actors who played the Pevensie children are brilliant and the film introduces Ben Barnes who is spellbinding as Caspian.

If you enjoyed either the original book or the first film you will almost certainly love this adaptation.

Apart from the five leads, other excellent performances come from Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan and Eddie Izzard as Reepicheep, the leader of the talking mice - an incredibly difficult role to bring off because he has to be funny in places but also genuinely heroic. (If you've not read the book, imagine a version of Antonio Banderas's character from Shrek II except that where the swordfighting cat is 80% comic and 20% hero, Reepicheep the swordfighting mouse is 80% hero and 20% comic.) Warwick Davis is excellent as the black dwarf Nikabrak and Peter Dinklage is even better as the cynical but golden hearted dwarf Trumpkin.

Previous reviewers have posted some excellent descriptions of the film from the viewpoint of a newcomer to Narnia, so I will add a few comments aimed at those who are familiar with the books but have not yet seen the film.

Surprisingly, the film managed both to be reasonably true to the spirit of the book and also keep me in suspense, because the way the story was presented kept me thinking the film must be about to diverge from Lewis's plot, though it usually didn't. In fact almost all the major events of the book eventually happened in the film in more or less the same way, along with most of my favourite details of the book, although the order of events is not quite the same.

What's missing: Bacchus and his wild girls have been censored, and any schoolteachers cursed with naughty children may be disappointed to learn that the scene where a class of horrid little boys get turned into pigs has been taken out. The Bulgy Bear does get to be one of the Marshals for the duel between Peter and Miraz, but the delightful little exchange when he reminds Peter that he has the right to that position ""I'm a bear, I am!"") didn't make it into the final cut. When Aslan summons the River God, the latter doesn't need any further permission to deal with the Bridge of Beruna. When the DVD comes out I shall be fascinated to see if any of these are in the ""Deleted scenes.""

What's been added: this story gives far more details of the battles than the original book, and also to the political manouvering amongst the Telmarines. In the original the initial battle between the forces of Caspian and the Narnians, and those of the Telmarines loyal to Miraz, is passed over in a few lines written in the past tense. In the film a completely different battle which has, however, an equivalent place in the story is shown in gripping detail. The desperate battle which follows the duel is also depicted in much greater detail than in the book.

Anna Popplewell's character Susan Pevensie also gets a significantly meatier role than in the book: Queen Susan is not just a formidable archer herself but plays a heroic role commanding the Narnian archers at the Battle of Beruna and she also has what looks like a near romance with Caspian.

Having built up Susan's character as much as they have in this film, the producer may have created even more trouble than they would probably already have had in allowing her to drift away from Narnia as recorded in the book ""The Last Battle."" This is probably the most controversial aspect of the seven books although it is not true, as frequently alleged (especially by people who want to denigrate C.S. Lewis) that Susan is excluded from heaven: the reason Susan doesn't meet the other characters in Heaven at the end of the series is that she isn't dead yet. Speaking as an arch-purist where being true to Lewis's original vision is concerned, a more positive role for Susan at the end of the series is one of the few modifications which would not annoy me.

Although Peter and Susan are told at the end of ""Prince Caspian"" that they are not coming back to Narnia, William Mosely as High King Peter may get a cameo role at the end of the world (Narnia, not earth) in ""The Last Battle"" and Anna Popplewell will probably have a chance to play Queen Susan again in ""The Horse and his Boy"" which is set during the Golden Age which follows the main action of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" e.g. the period while the Pevensies are Kings and Queens in Narnia, before they return to Earth at the end of the book.

Conclusion: broadly true to the book, gripping and exciting, well worth going to see. I can't wait to see Ben Barnes, Skandar Keyes, and Georgie Henshaw return in ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader.""",1216512000,2,4748,4.595041322314049
1611154,4,B00005JPH2,"I read the Narnia Series with my Dad when I was five, and have adored them since, so I am probably a bit biased in favor of the books.
Even taking bias into account, however, I have to say that the film fell short of my expectations.

The action and the special effects were incredible, and I certainly can't find fault with them, but the plot adaption and several characters were just awful.

I liked the portrayal of Nikabrik, Trumpkin and Reepicheep (yes, he really is that disgustingly noble and battle-ready), especially Nikabrik, and Miraz was a wonderful example of guy-we-love-to-hate. I also liked that we saw more of Prumaprismia, and that Glozzelle was changed from a lord to a general, giving us a good example that not all Telmarines are rotten apples.
Caspian I also thought was well played, starting out as naieve, then with a growing maturity. The way he discovered that his uncle killed his father was a bit too 'Star Wars' for my taste, but it could have been worse.
I enjoyed how they brought back the White Witch as a temptation, simultaniously giving Peter and Caspian a slap up the head, and the symbolism of Edmund being the one to break the ice.

The other characters, however, were something of a let down. In the Book Version of Prince Caspian, Peter is very mature and responsible, and tells Caspian that he has 'not come to take your place, but to put you in it'. Given that, why is movie-Peter suddenly acting like a self-obsessed brat and playing my-throne-is-bigger-than-your-throne?
While watching the movie, I often found myself looking around to see if I could find Susan. Movie-Susan spends the first half of the film whining about just about everything, then turns into a fighting heroine a few seconds after meeting Caspian. What happened to the Susan who was a mostly sensible and nice girl, (She was called 'the Gentle' for a reason, people) but listened to her fears too much. And when did she turn into a Xena-knock-off?
Lucy and Edmund I found very little complaint with, but I felt that their parts were very over-shadowed. I enjoyed how Edmund and Lucy were coming into their own, especially the way Lucy was standing up for what she believed in and showing the Faithful and Valiant Narnian Queen that we all love, and Edmund's new maturity.

On the other hand, I found the Susan/Caspian romance unrealistic and pointless. It served no real purpose, had no connection to the plot, and was badly-done to begin with. Yes, we are repeatedly informed throughout the series that Susan is the 'beauty of the family' but they are in the middle of a war! They spend almost no time together, have nothing in common, and Susan shows no interest until a few minutes before the end of the film, when she kisses him in front of everyone. Given the middle-ages setting of Narnia, that would not be seen as acceptable behavior for a Queen, especially with no formal intentions between them.

Overall: lots of potential and good effects, but definately could have been better.",1216339200,,3004,4.736137667304015
1611155,5,B00005JPH2,"One year after they returned to their normal lives in England, the Pevensie children return to Narnia, this time to help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), a Telmarine prince, defeat his usurping uncle and restore peace and order to Narnia.

All of the newspaper reviews that I have read of this film, and of its predecessor, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" have been very mediocre, and I don't understand why.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of these movies and consider them to be among the best of the wave of children's fantasy movies that have appeared in cinemas, following the success of the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" films. In fact, I preferred the Narnia films to the both of these above-mentioned series. I thought they were considerably more exciting and thought the children to be far more realistically portrayed than Harry Potter and his friends.

""Prince Caspian"" is essentially a war film and the film mostly comprises a series of battles. In other hands, over two hours of cinematic battles could be the sort of thing to put some audience members to sleep, from the sheer repetitiveness of what is going on, but writer/director Andrew Adamson brings enough variety to the action and also includes enough character interaction between the battles to maintain the audience's attention and to make them care about whether our heroes actually win or not.

Be aware, in most countries this movie has a PG (or equivalent) rating, which suggests that this film is suitable for children. Although there is no swearing or sex, and no one actually bleeds in any of the battles, there are many elements to this film that could potentially disturb young children. When I saw this film, a family with young children was sitting behind me, and one of the children spent the film sitting in his mother's lap, hiding is face from the monsters and other ""scary"" creatures that were appearing on the screen.",1215907200,2,1915,4.847094801223242
1611156,5,B00005JPH2,"Really the definitive adaptions of Narnia continue, with a vision remarkably true to the story which is quite a feat in any big budget adaption.

The themes of CS Lewis are strong and not 'dumbed down' despite being transposed in the adaptation, and from the again fine choices in casting all round to fantastic production, it's just a rarely wonderful fantasy film.  ""It's different everytime"" when you return to Narnia and isn't that great!

Andrew Adamson surely must be at the peak of his powers as everything about these Narnia films seems to be at the right time at the right place in my estimation -it's one fault is a mis-guided big end battle narrative that while well done doesn't fit the film but fortunately this can be chapter skipped to the next beat pretty much on the mark of Lucy finding Aslan in the forest for a wonderful conclusion. The  soundtrack isn't as memorably as the first, as the re-use of some of the first outings great themes are in evidence although their are some nice new themes too - the castle raid with the mice being a highlight for that.

A great film experience that again entranced me from the opening to the end...as i thought it would. Why wouldn't you want to go adventuring in Narnia?",1214870400,2,1230,4.598173515981735
1611157,5,B00005JPH2,"Usually wary of sequels, I was amazed at how Prince Caspian compared to The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.  It was AMAZING!!!  I have a 3-year-old daughter who has been enthralled with Narnia since the first movie was released (and she was only a year old then).  As a reading teacher, I always tell my students that the books are so much better than the movies.  With this series, I must say that as much as I love the books (and I've read the series over and over again), the movies are so much better!!!  I only wish C.S. Lewis was alive to see what remarkable things Disney has done with his books.",1214784000,2,606,4.280701754385965
1611158,2,B00005JPH2,"Having disliked the first movie (until pretty much the finale), and own but have never watched the BBC versions, I was kidding myself that I actually wanted to go and see them. But after getting my big book of all seven books in one back after two years (TWO YEARS) I started reading Prince Caspian again - and I read it overnight. I finished it at 9am, I saw the film at 7:30pm. (I've now started reading all the books from the beginning again, although skipping The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe/The Horse and His Boy as read the first one too many times, and the latter is the worst.)

With the book fresh in my mind, it probably wasn't the greatest idea to go right into seeing the movie. My other big mistake was thinking that Andrew Adamson would actually stay faithful to the book. I learnt to read through these books (my dad could NOT do the voices), and have had a love of reading ever since. Quite an accomplishment in this day and age when kids are more interested in hanging about street corners than sitting quietly reading.

The books aren't being filmed in chronological order, which I'm not too sad about, considering what comes between TLTWATW and Prince Caspian, The Horse And His Boy. In my opinion, THAHB was the worst book. As long as they film The Silver Chair, The Last Battle - OK, I like the rest of the books. As long as they film all of them, I won't complain. There's really not much need to have The Horse & His Boy inbetween, since all it really does is introduce the Telmarines.

The film starts with introducing Caspian, but cutting out most of his back story and only giving us a hint of what is really going on. I instantly realised this film wasn't going to be the film of my childhood imagination, when they did a major bit wrong - Caspian is unconscious when he's rescued by the dwarves, not awake. Then a couple of scenes later, Caspian blows the 'magic' horn. This wasn't even 'seen' in the book, it was only mentioned afterwards.

Then we're shot straight back to war torn London, where Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are all waiting to go back to school. Susan gets chatted up - another silly point in the movie.

You know what happens after this - if you've actually read the book. I don't mind people who haven't actually read the books, I will quite happily lend it to them - but not if they keep it for two years. But people who talk about the Narnia books, but seem to only talk about TLTWATW - hello there's another six books!!! Grrr.

The actors are getting slightly better now into the second movie. They're like the Harry Potter actors - they always suck in the first movie. I still don't like Anna Popplewell as Susan, and she seems to 'blossom' in this movie. From the outrageous flirting with Caspian (they don't even share a scene together in the book until chapter 15) to her figure in the outfit when they're trying to get to Aslan's How - it's rated a PG for a reason love, put them away. That's what I would call a 'wench' in that outfit. The romantic subplot between her and Caspian was really irrelevant- it did not move the storyline forward in the slightest (except to make me cringe) and the heart wrenching scene at the end??? She doesn't even appear again in any more of the books, except albeit briefly. So heart wrenching. She hasn't even had any scenes in the next book yet.

Ben Barnes as Caspian was absolutely atrocious. He based his accent on Antonio Banderas, and it was truly awful at points. He was never my favourite character in the books, so thankfully he's only in for two books approximately.

Andrew Adamson previously did the Shrek movies, and no doubt there was some influences - if you look at Puss In Boots, and Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard, which I didn't think would work) they're almost the same character. And funnily enough, one's a cat and one's a mouse.

There's one big battle in the book. The director obviously thought it would be 'fun' to add in another battle scene, the night raid on the castle, which was unnecessary and to extend the other battle scenes so they not only became tiresome and bored me. Not necessary. Also, the reappearance of the White Witch was merely suggested in the book, and never actually appeared, but she's appears in this for a few minutes.

One can only hope that they stick more closely to the books in future films. Or get shot of Andrew Adamson. Maybe I'll have forgotten my anger by the time Voyage Of The Dawn Treader comes out in 2010. Read the books in the chronological order as CS Lewis wanted them to be read.",1214524800,4,4551,4.452581032412965
1611159,4,B00005JPH2,"In the brilliant second installment of the well-known Chronicles of Narnia, I was riveted. The plot didn't perfectly stick to the book - but somehow they still managed to make it work greater than you would expect from today's Hollywood. I was disappointed that they cut out the summary of Caspian's life leading up to the birth of Miraz's son - instead they expected you to know what he learns in advance. Regardless of the hype about the movie's violence, they actually eliminated most of the battles, instead focusing on two major battles - one of which they managed to create a full length scene from a single line in Lewis' books - a line where Reepicheep mentions the possibility of storming Miraz's castle in order to eliminate some of their opponents.

Caspian's effects were brilliant - and of course they are, with a large group of the best CGI companies out there!

The romance between Susan and Caspian was unexpected and unrelated to the book, but it didn't fall completely out of bounds - it was nice to see a little love in a Narnia that had been lacking for the previous 1300 years.

I would tend to keep this movie away from the younger crowd, because even though this isn't a messy blood-and-guts film, there are a lot of obvious and up-close deaths - but those reviewers who discounted the movie solely because of this need to take into account that Prince Caspian (and many other of the Narnia books) is ABOUT A WAR. Disney or not, we can't stray away from the plotline of the book like that, or we might as well rename the movie to something else.

What it comes down to is that this movie is brilliantly filmed, doesn't stray TOO much from the book (and when it does it still works great), and both the scenery and the effects are amazing.

It's totally worth the buy, especially in HD ! 4.5 stars!",1214265600,2,1820,4.519756838905775
1611160,4,B00005JPH2,"I am going to say up front that I really enjoyed this movie.  I was delighted and entertained.  Prince Caspian follows The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as the second installment of the classic Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis.  It is a strong sequel:  the pacing is terrific, the plot moves quickly along, and the visuals are absolutely exquisite, both location and CGI.  All of the performances and characterizations are top notch.  Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ARE the characters in my head from the books.  Aslan IS Aslan; I couldn't ask for anything more.  The introduction of Reepicheep, the valiant and loyal mouse, is wonderful.  He leaps perfectly from the book to the screen, as real and alive as I have always imagined him.  Trumpkin, Prince Caspian, the Badger, Nickabrick, the Trees (oh, those amazing Trees!!!!!), Miraz, the Doctor, etc., are all that I expected, and in many cases, more.

Now, here is where it loses the star:  this movie is much more of a departure from the book than The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was.  I can't help it, I lived in Narnia for many years.  I still visit at least once a year.  I have the chapters, the dialog, the entire series memorized.  As I watched this movie, the book was playing in parallel inside my head, so, to me, the changes and omissions were obvious.  Most of them were merely annoying, but two things really bugged me.

1. The love interest between Caspian and Susan does not exist in the book. So why the need to turn this into a teen romance?  I agree with Edmund, I don't want to understand it.

2. The constant sparring between Peter and Caspian is totally unnecessary, and it adds nothing, IMHO.  In the books, Peter clearly tells Caspian that he has come to put him on his throne, not to take it.  He is a very supportive friend.  So why the ""my crown is bigger than yours"" tension?  I found it ridiculous and distracting.

Again, all the salient points from the book made it to the screen, and overall, I was charmed and enchanted by this movie.  Disney is doing a splendid job translating these classics to film. I hope they do all seven.  The Narnian in me just wants them to stay closer to the stories that C. S. Lewis wrote.  However, that does not prevent me from highly recommending this film.",1213833600,8,2294,4.529268292682927
1611161,4,B00005JPH2,"One year after the events of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find them drawn back into Narnia.  1300 years have passed there and their former castle is in ruins.  They have been summoned by Prince Caspian (Barnes), who is in hiding from his uncle, King Miraz (Castellitto), who has marked him for death.  If the Pevensie kids can help him reclaim his throne, all the creatures of the land will be able to live in peace.  If not, Miraz will rule ruthlessly.

""Prince Caspian"" brings the Narnia series to the next level.  The effects are improved, the action is improved, and the actors seem more comfortable in their roles.  Ben Barnes, as the titular character, is average however.  He lacks enough personality to make us care about Caspian, but that is a small quibble in an otherwise entertaining film.  Director Andrew Adamson has learned from the first film and improved the finished product.  Although rated PG, it is more in line with {G-13 fare due to a load of violence.

1611204,5,B00005JPH2,"Without going into too much detail about the movie, I think that it's an overall success.  Many can nitpick from beginning to end, but this is a fun, well-made movie that follows the book very closely.

The four kids have grown up after a few years away from Narnia - even though the ratio of Earth years to Narnia years is roughtly 1:1300.  During that time away, the Narnians have been under siege and face the threat of extinction.  In fact, humans from that age, the Telmarines, believe the Narnians to be extinct since their ancestors have savagely attacked the Narnians for centuries.

At the presetn Narnian time, Prince Caspian is about to be usurped as the ruler of Telmarine, because his uncle Miraz has just had a son who is the potential heir to a throne.  As medieval custome would have it, an assassination attempt is about to ensue.

Naturally, Prince Caspian ends up summoning the Pevensies back to Narnia where they team up alongside the Narnian animals to fight against the xenophobic Telmarines.  Just as the first movie, it's still great to see the animals on the side of the humans; the fight scenes take a ton of imagination and some very believable CGI.  From gnomes to minotaurs, fawns to sphinxes, and even non-mythical animals that can speak, it's one for all and all for one.  Speaking of that philosophy, the Musketeer theme, a swashbuckling mouse stole the whole show.  From the minute he appeared, he reminded me of the cat in Shrek, with prim and proper attitude, incredible swordsmanship, and a sense of dignity as a fighter.

The sweet innocence takes a back-seat in this sequel.  Whereas they were children before, the Pevensies are now much more mature - on screen as well as in real life.  It's similar to the Harry Potter series; the kids can't stay the same age and the story must evolve.  As a result, there is quite a bit more action in this movie, the battle scenes are harsher, and there is obviously some killing going on...some of which at the hands of the children.  Personally, I like this change.

There are only two problems I had with the movie, both of which have been mentioned by other reviewers.  The river scene was stolen straight out of the LOTR movies, as was the tree fighting scenes.  Although, the trees didn't have faces in this version, and used their roots as strangling tools, whips, and bats.  I don't care when the books were written and who came up with the original idea first.  When someone comes out with a thunder-stealing movie before yours is supposed to be created and/or release, it should be modified for originality.  Nontheless, it's a great movie, and I'll happily devour every book-to-movie translation of the series.",1212710400,3,2697,4.717948717948718
1611205,3,B00005JPH2,"""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is the sort of movie that has one group of people it caters to and one it does not. The group the movie does not cater to is the book lovers. These people are the sort of people who read books and complain about the movies for insignificant changes. These are the sort of people who say they would have no problem with the movie if it was under a different title, a logic I've never completely understood, seeing as how book huggers still complain about ""The Secret of NIMH (original title: ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH""). The second type of person is the kind that likes well made movies, with good characterization and story development, and changes don't bother them as long as it doesn't effect the movie. If you are in the latter category then this movie is more likely to be your style. Set two years after the previous film, ""Prince Caspian"" revolves around the title character blowing Queen Susan's old horn, thus summoning the Pevensie children back to Narnia for another big budget adventure.

Narnia is not the same place it used to be though. Though it has been only two years since the Pevensie children have been to Narnia, in Narnian time it's been 1,300 years. Which means no there's no beavers, no Mr. Tumnus, and Aslan seems to be missing in action as well. Most fantasy series slowly kills off old characters while introducing new ones. This one simply finishes with one cast and starts fresh with a new one. It's to C.S. Lewis's credit as a storyteller that this stunt isn't as fatal as it sounds. There's also a new ruler in Narnia, though he is a false God...er, I mean king. See, Prince Caspian is supposed to be the real ruler of Narnia, but his selfish uncle used his political power to steal the thrown and attempted to kill Caspian.

Now Caspian has summoned the Pevensie children to help him reclaim his throne. Looking at these last two paragraphs I wrote I'm sure this must sound terribly dull. Theoretically, wouldn't someone rather watch (and in some cases, read) ""Hamlet"" instead? It's the same basic story, and Shakespear's story is certainly more sophisticated then Lewis's writing is. Well, that may be, but Shakespear never wrote stories with centaurs, eagles, and sword wielding mice either. ""Prince Caspian"" may be a run-of-the-mill ""evil uncle wants power"" story, but very few times does this story provide as much visual fun as this movie does. Even ""The Lion King"" feels subdued compared to this movie.

That said, Prince Caspian himself isn't all that interesting of a character, and the battle scenes are starting to feel a little tired by this point. A scene where Narnians must sneak into a castle is filmed with grace, style, and suspense. Less so is a later scene where hoards of soldiers and animals run into each other, killing left and right until you can't even tell who the good guys or bad guys are anymore. One of these days one of these fantasy movies are going to have to address this problem and have the hero accidently kill one of his comrades among the confusion. The villain is also less interesting then the witch from the previous film. The pointy beard and the snare show that he is indeed evil, but that doesn't make him an interesting character that you can sink your teeth into.

Arrogant men like this also fail in the end. Likewise the Christian themes are still present, but amidst all the violence and killing, they may be harder to find. This is also the most violent PG rated film in years and borderlines on PG-13, so parents might want to keep that in mind before taking young children to see this. Disney's adaptation of ""The Lion, The Witch, & The Wardrobe"" was a competent film, though fans of the franchise were quick to note that it was basically a remake of the BBC mini-series, only good this time around. On the other hand ""Prince Caspian"" feels very different from the BBC mini-series. The story has been torn down and rebuilt from the ground up, and is now something fans can sink their teeth into. There is now no question as to which is the better version. Finally, though I do believe that books and movies should be separated and not compared, I'm going to make one note to the book huggers out there: Prince Caspian was made older because the producers wanted him to fight in the battles. If you have issues with that you can always read the book again.

Rating: *** and a half stars",1212624000,4,4422,4.606598984771574
1611206,5,B00005JPH2,"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy return to Narnia when a young prince uses Susan's horn to call for help. Only 1 year has passed for the Pevensie children, but Narnia has aged over 1,000 years. The Narnians have been overcome by the Telmarines. And Prince Caspian's evil uncle wants to destroy the last of the Narnians and become king himself.

The Pevensie's are again faced with challenges to their morals and convictions. They have gone through a lot of changes since the beginning of their first adventure to Narnia, and their character has grown as well. But as pivotal decisions are made, huge mistakes can cost the lives of the few Narnians left.

Prince Caspian is a humble and brave young man, destined to rule Narnia. He is just and merciful, and has been raised to be leader that the Narnians need him to be. With a powerful message, this movie not only is dramatic and heart-felt, but has a deeper meaning that one doesn't have to look far to see. Much more action-packed and suspenseful than its predecessor, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; there is never a dull moment in Prince Caspian. Laced with a bit of humor and even a bit of budding romance, this installment veers several times away from the original book. But the changes are necessary to make a successful, longer movie.

1611207,4,B00005JPH2,"""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" returns audiences to the land of C.S. Lewis' epic world. The film is a fine sequel to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" but doesn't stand up fully with the original. While the acting, visual effects and action sequences are fantastic, the story is slow-moving during the first half, but picks up in the latter half. The villain of the piece is also a little bit week, which is either due to the actor or the writing. Also, the awe and wonder of the first film is missing for the most part in this film. Still, this is an epic film that fans of Narnia will surely enjoy.

Let me clear the air very quickly so you don't waste your time deciding if you agree with me or not;  I NEVER compare films to the video games, books, short stories or TV shows they are sourced from .  I believe that as a different medium, expectations for a film should be a clean slate.  I refuse to hate or love a film because it was unfaithful or faithful to its source material.  End of speech.

My Review; (FULL OF SPOILERS)

-I THOUGHT THE ENTS MADE THEIR LAST MARCH?
In this, the 4th chapter in the LOTR ""Trilogy"" the Ents go on the march again.  I thought they had declared ""The last march of the Ents"" 3 films ago?  Oh well, the river gods wash away the bad guys again just like in the first film but this time the victims are humans and not the ring Wraiths.  I found this confusing since I thought the humans were the good guys in the LOTR series?  Hold on, someone is reading over my shoulder... ...what? Oh?  This isn't LOTR?  IS MY FACE RED!  Sorry.  Never mind.

-LOST ON THE WAY TO HOGWARTS
This 6th entry in the ""Harry Potter"" series was a bit disappointing.  I love the Hogwarts Express but in this film the train just zooms right past Harry and friends and opens a doorway to another place that looks nothing like Hogwarts.  They certainly could not fool me into believing these were the same actors as in the first 5 Harry Potter films just by dressing them like Hogwarts students... ...what?  Not Harry Potter?  DOH!!!

-WHY REMAKES SUCK
I'm not sure why the powers-that-be decided to make a remake of ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" since it was just done a few years ago.  Not only do they make a half hearted re-do, but they twist around the story so it's only mildly different; very annoying.  Instead of the bad guys being scary beasts lead by a snow queen, these are now the good guys.  Instead of humans being the good guys, they are the bad guys... ...and the good guys, sort of... ... never mind!  Any way, Aslan the Lion is exactly the same in this version.  He even saves the day like in the first film (so easily that I question the need for any other heroes), even though he mutters a couple times about how things can't happen the same way twice (and yet they do).  The kids are all the same actors and I liked them in both films, especially Lucy.  And then there's Prince Caspian; he's not even in the original version... ...what?  This is a different story?  This is called ""Prince Caspian""?  MY BAD!!  Man, I am so confused!

-I WAS WATCHING A FILM AND A VIDIOGAME BROKE OUT...
I enjoyed the first Narnia film on a whimsical sort of level.  It was fairly harmless action with fun characters and fair to excellent Visual FX.  This film is a bit more ambitious and yet not always up to the task.  With the influx of massed hoarse and humans formations, CG was used to prevent probable animal injury.  The unfortunate result is a bunch of videogame polygon figures running about.  Some of these computer models hardly looked rendered; just awful.  Those Ents and the River Spirits were also below the state-of-the-art.  When you consider that LOTR was made 6 and 7 years ago and looks much better, that's pretty shameful.  Not all of the film looked bad, but enough did to spoil it for me.

-WHO'S THE AUDIENCE?
Like the first version... ...er, film, there is much violence.  Like the first film, there is little blood.  Like the first film, my 9 year old daughter was afraid of what the violence implied.  Unlike the first film, my 6 year old was bored (as were I and my wife).  The themes were dark and complex, the characters light, the casualty rate high.  The story pacing was slow, the plot full of overly convenient loopholes and the dialogue at times incoherent.  Imagine explaining the rights of royal succession to a 6 year old during a movie.  Imagine a 9 year old asking why Caspian's uncle had to wait to have a son before he could murder Caspian for the throne.  I did not have a reasonable answer (Smart girl).  This film satisfied no one while trying to satisfy everyone (at least in my family).

-IN THE END...
...I felt gypped.  Source material not withstanding, this was really a retelling of the first film with a few little twists.  The visual FX were actually worse than the original and certainly much worse than the older films it so vividly reminded me of.  The final scene is played out with reverence and purpose; implying that some sort of lesson should be gleaned from the preceding events.  I'm not going to get into the obvious religious implications of the message but it was overly simplistic.  Finally, two characters are declared to have grown beyond Narnia when in actuality they grew little and showed much room for improvement.  Despite the attempt at spectacle, the theaters big screen exposed the bad visuals and was wasted on a story that seemed only half thought out, relying on one characters overwhelming magic to save the day.  My family and I were fairly disappointed in this fairly mediocre film.  If you are a big fan of the first film and can ignore poor visual FX, you might like this.  Otherwise wait for the rental.",1211846400,3,5134,4.474649406688242
1611209,3,B00005JPH2,"In this second movie in the Narnia series there's a lot of violence and killing. I would not recommend it for kiddies under ten because animal and mythological characters, the good guys, get killed and maimed in large numbers. The kiddos are going to be upset by some of the excessive violence in this sequel. Adults should be too. The battle scenes get repetitive, and the movie is too long. The villains are cardboard stereotypes.
The wife of a usurper to the throne gives birth to a baby so the usurper decides it is time to get rid of Prince Caspian, actor Ben Barnes, who was Dakin in the play/movie ""The History Boys."" Here he gives a rather bland performance, and it's the four English school kids who shine as they did in the first outing, but these kids are quite active in the killing and combat even though it's the bad guys they are fighting. For a movie aimed mostly at a young audience, there is an awful lot of slaughtering of human beings and creatures going on. When adults kill adults, it's bad enough, but when youngsters are doing it, I think it sends the wrong message.
The wicked witch makes a cameo appearance in a giant ice cube. As in the first episode, there are talking animals and mythological figures, but some viewers missed seeing more of the lion Aslan. The special effects are well-done. Moviegoers will recognize the good dwarf from other films - Peter Dinklage -especially good in ""Death at a Funeral."" There are a great many reaction shots of the oldest boy as he realizes they're in deep doodoo as many Narnians get wiped out.",1211846400,,1563,4.565836298932385

1611211,2,B00005JPH2,"Note To Andrew Adamson: You Screwed Up.

First off, I really liked the first movie, it was a blend of fun, adventure and family fun with spiritual values that weren't muted by Hollywood. However, the first one was so good, it would be very hard to top it. It's possible, but not likely. And let me also say, that in this case, I don't like it when I'm right.

The opening sequence, rather than the Blitz of the first film, we are thrown into the Prince running away for some reason, on the advice of his mentor, who strangely looks like a Hogwarts professor reject. Five minutes later, I'm already bored. Then we are introduced to the kids from the first movie, whose last name I will not even try to pronounce. Things are noticeably different for them. Susan has taken to lying in order to brush pompous boys off her shoulder, and Peter has taken to fighting with anybody that gives him the slightest bit of cause to do so. Why the personality changes? They long for Narnia, and are growing impatient, after all it has been a year. Then just like that, Narnia appears not in a wardrobe, but in a train station.

When they get to Narnia, things are also different, there's ruins, and some creatures don't talk, and most of the rest are restless to say the least. The dwarfs for example are utterly useless and annoying, and I was actually rooting for them to be expended by the end. You know, these are the creatures who were reduced to working for the witch in the last movie? Which they say they would gladly do again.

The children eventually join forces with the Spanish Prince, and decide to get the prince back his throne, using lots of useless violence. First they storm a castle, which doesn't end well. Mostly due to Caspian, who also becomes quickly unlikable. And his character only gets worse, climaxing in a scene where the dwarfs summon demons and other scary stuff that force Caspian use his blood to bring back the witch from the last movie. And this is a family movie?

Note to Andrew Adamson: What in the heck were you thinking here?

Then there's a swordfight with Peter and the evil king, who is eventually defeated, only to be quickly replaced by a worse guy, who is quickly defeated in an almost cameo by Aslan. What the deal there? The Lion doesn't appear till the end of the movie, and his part is so minor that it could have been easily rewritten for another character to save the day? Then the movie ends.

Many words on the ending: Again, utterly pointless and forced. Why exactly are the children so willing to go back to ""earth?"" I mean, they were so mad at the beginning about not being there, then they get no leisure while they are there, and are confronted with nothing but trouble, and they're so willing to leave. They're basically like, 'Yeah, that's nice, ready to go back now, see you later, take care.' And then Peter and Susan aren't coming back? And I totally missed the point there. They've learned everything they can learn? If anything, Lucy and Edmund learned more, while the older ones kept screwing up.

Note to Andrew Adamson: What the heck were you thinking?

Then there's the kiss. What's the point of that, exactly? Did some movie exec say, 'Where's the kiss? We can't have a cute boy and girl without sexual-tension!' Again, like the rest of the movie, forced and pointless. They kiss, and they'll never see each other again, even though they didn't really care that much about each other in the first place.

Now, don't think I didn't like the movie... well, never mind, I didn't. But there was some good points... There was Lucy! And there was the cute Badger, who had no role! And how could we forget the mouse? The cute mouse that your love for just boils over everytime you see it, except for its last scene.

Wait, I forgot one last thing. When I really thought 'what the heck' during the actual movie, instead of thinking about it while trying to sleep after I got back home from the theatre, was when the trees came alive and started ""fighting"" the enemy. If that isn't the most lazy steal from The Lord of The Rings ever, I don't know what is. And that was actually one of the better parts in the whole series.

Note To Andrew Adamson: What the heck?

Overall, while your little children will like most of the movie, mostly thinking about the mouse, you will cringe thinking about the movie afterwards on almost every aspect. In fact, you'll think, why did I even pay to go and see the movie? But, if you take it for what it is, you'll like it better. My major problems with the movie was mostly the bad writing. Bad characters, bad scenes, bad story, and terrible ending.

Hopefully, if there is a third one (and Disney will think twice before going any farther on the third one), it will be better, as it is being helmed by fresh eyes. It will still lack half of the main cast, but hey, at least I'll have zero expectations for it. And when you have no expectations, you can't easily be disappointed.",1211587200,9,4963,4.475663716814159

They arrive at the ruins of their former castle Cair Paravel, and find that the chests containing their personal effects and weapons still remain, hidden beyond a secret door.  After a fortuitous rescue of the dwarf Trumpkin, they eventually make their way to Aslan's How, a tomb built around the sacrificial stone table of movie one.

While all this is going on, the Telmarine Prince Caspian is having a few domestic problems after his Uncle Miraz sires a son and heir, and decides that two princes spoil the plot.  Assisted by his tutor, Caspian finds his way into the woods, where he meets the Narnians, long thought to be extinct.

As you will have guessed, the Prince and the Pevensies join forces with the Narnians to oppose the heavily armed and armored Telmarine forces, and the majority of the movie revolves around the epic battles and skirmishes.  Also in the movie, but played down to an extent, is the religious symbolism of the lion Aslan, and the simple faith of the youngest child, Lucy.  The characters of Peter and Susan are left to learn from their mistakes, and Edmund finally comes into his own.

I found the movie to be dark and somewhat violent, and even though there's no blood visibly shed on screen, it's pretty obvious that many characters die in one way or another.  Personally I have no problem with that, but I'd consider the level of maturity of a child before allowing them to watch this movie.

Mostly faithful to the book, this movie is all about the action.

1611262,4,B00005JPH2,"I don't get to say this very often, but the Prince Caspian movie was better than the novel.

When I read through the Narnia series a few months ago, I had the thought that for the books to be made into good films, the Disney writers were going to have to add some scenes, to fill in the blanks where C.S. Lewis' high creativity fell short.

This film does a great job filling in the blanks. 4 or 5 key scenes were added to the film rather seemlessly, and moviegoers who haven't read the books in a long while won't even realize which scenes are new to the story. I had a hard enough time distinguishing, and I just read the novels.

All that said, the movie is a good time...humorous, action-packed, tense, and creative. More than anything, the film paints an accurate picture of Lucy's faith journey with Aslan and how her siblings learn with her.

Fun times.

The book series has been popular since they were first published nearly fifty years ago, and they've never gone out of print.  Earlier movie versions, animated and live-action, have been made of them.  But after the success of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, fans hoped for more and Hollywood banked on another success.

I had a good time with the first movie.  Taking my son with me enhanced the experience, though.  His innocent glee stripped years away from me and eased me right back into my own childhood.  The sights and sounds of the world were amazing, as they would have to be in order to grab the audiences lying out there in wait now.  And the pacing of the movie was well done.

However, Narnia purists are going to have a problem with this version of the novel.  Hollywood has strayed far from the path in making this sequel.  Yes, it's true, Narnia has been Hollywoodized and given the big box office treatment.  Which means that more has been left out of the book than was kept in, and even more new material was shoveled into the story.  In fact, a whole rivalry sequence between Caspian (Ben Barnes) and Peter (William Moseley) has been tossed into the mix, as well as Susan (Anna Popplewell) ""crushing"" on Caspian.

Also, the battle scenes are definitely more hardcore than they are in the book.  And protracted.  The novel dealt with them in a straight-forward manner and moved into the characters and the spirituality of the book.

But I have to give Hollywood its due.  I'd wager most of the people buying tickets haven't ever read the books, just as they hadn't read THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  They're there packing the seats because they want to see adventure, excitement, and royal battles between good and evil.

I'd even read PRINCE CASPIAN to my son shortly after we watched THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.  We'd read that book before the movie and he knew everything that was going to happen.  He kept throwing hints to his mom during the movie.  This time he really believed we hadn't read the book because so much was different.

Hollywood chose to change the story, and I accepted that within a few minutes and simply enjoyed what was on the screen without proprietary interest.  The special effects are awesome, the mythical beings are amazing, and the landscape is lush and incredible.  My son was bowled over as Narnia once again unfolded before us.  I have to admit, I was too.

Despite the differences in character and motivations, and the way the final battle was staged when Peter undertook single combat against Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), I had a great time.  Susan stepped into the battles and became an amazing warrior (okay, I had to swallow hard at that one when I saw her first shooting men with her bow then using it as a staff to battle again in the thick of the fighting while wearing no armor).  Peter was even more courageous than before, and naturally stepped into a leadership role.  Edmund (Skandar Keynes) was a fierce fighter as well, and the young actor has certainly grown into the role.  There is a fantastic scene where Lucy (Georgie Henley) blocks the retreating Telmarin army that had the audience laughing and cheering at the same time.  The kids have changed.

The assault on the castle at night was terrific.  My son and I sat on the edges of our seat and watched as the battle progressed and finally turned deadly.  And when Aslan (Liam Neeson) stepped onto the screen, we were in Narnia fighting the good fight at the sides of the Narnians.

Maybe this isn't a faithful interpretation of the original novel, but you're not going to be able to find a much better early summer offering.  I question the rating a little, because I would have bumped it up a notch due to all the physical action, the evil intent, and the PG rating isn't warning enough.

With all the fantasy and superhero movies hitting the screens this summer, finding one that stands out head and shoulders above the others is going to be hard.  I've decided not to stress over figuring out which one is the best, and instead concentrate on enjoying the feast!",1211500800,2,4212,4.636486486486486
1611266,2,B00005JPH2,"This film was one long battle sequence after the next. The production felt rushed, and any form of character development is thrown to the winds. Everything begins so abruptly. The setup at the start of the film is almost a joke. The dude that portrays Prince Caspian comes off as a bit of a douche. There was also an overabundace of CGI, AND the director borrows liberally from THE LORD OF THE RINGS and every other fantasy film imaginable.

All in all, this was an extremely disappointing experience. I'd compare it with the way I felt after seeing THE GOLDEN COMPASS, which was another pointless CGI-fest - although NARNIA wasn't as stupid. There were a few things to be admired here, but not enough for me to award it anything over two stars. By the way, Peter Dinklage was excellent as always, and was the only character that I cared about. I just hope that he moves away from this sort of thing. THE STATION AGENT was amazing...

Anyways...I loved the first one, and nearly loathed this one. They need to scrap this and start all over again. C.S. Lewis is probably rolling in his grave. Bless his heart.",1211414400,15,1108,4.562814070351759
1611267,3,B00005JPH2,"3 1/2 stars. Not quite good enough for a bump up to 4 though.
During the first twenty minutes of the film, I was wondering what could have inspired Mike LaSalle, from the San Francisco Chronicle, to give this such a poor review. The magic of Narnia was alive in abundance, even if Caspian's home resembled Hogwart's, even though I found the decision not to develop Caspian as a character early in the film puzzling (that decision cost them in the end), and couldn't understand why Spaniards were cast as the Telmarines. Have Spaniards become evil? I wasn't aware.

While I do not share Mr. LaSale's decidedly poor opinion, the film fell rapidly from an initial five-star flush to its current rating. The film was overlong by at least thirty minutes, and although the film wasted time having characters standing about, talking, thinking, looking--in essence, doing nothing--it didn't develop some of the most important relationships. Lucy called Trumpkin her ""DLF"" - dear little friend. However, I'm hard pressed to find a point prior to her labeling him as such where something happened between the two of them to justify that.

Caspian (Ben Barnes) was perhaps the greatest disappointment. Not that Barnes did anything wrong, he just wasn't given much to work with. He was as cardboard as they come, and he shouldn't have been. The producers chose to stay reasonably true to the book, so why they hung Caspian out to dry is beyond me.

Some of the other problems I had with the film I also have with the book, so they don't factor into my rating. That said, I do have to say *something*. Aslan allowed the Telmarines to invade Narnia, nearly wipe out all Narnians, and he didn't do a thing about it until the Pevensies came back 1300 years later? Really? Can't say I find him very inspiring. He didn't have a good explanation for his indifference in either the book or the movie, because there is no good explanation for it, aside from this being an unabashedly Christian story, written by one of last century's greatest Christian apologists, and Christianity (no offense to Christians or to Christianity) has a relationship with its God that allows for that God (and all his/her incarnations) to ignore all sorts of horrors. But Narnia is fiction, and when crafting a fictional tale one must have a better reason than, ""Well, it's all a part of a grand plan that we just don't understand. Sure, twenty million people were killed, but I'm sure we deserved it, and if we didn't, it was at least good for us.""

Still, it was entertaining at times, and that earned it three stars. The film seems to have a bit of an identity complex, as if it can't decide whether it wants to be entirely aimed at children, or to be a film aimed at everyone. Having Ben Barnes cast as Caspian, who, at 26, is at least 10 year older than Caspian was in the book, is telling.

I'm still interested to see if they can learn from their mistakes, capitalize on what they've earned with Reepicheep's character, and make the next movie, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, a great one. It's a compelling story, so I have high hopes for it.",1211414400,3,3109,4.6454545454545455
1611268,4,B00005JPH2,"To be written by an atheist, this one matches some monsters from the underworld.  To be basically a children's book, it is much too violent and the story for more mature viewers.  The child actors have grown up pretty well -- better than those in the Harry Potter series -- and it was like seeing an old friend, but young children should not be taken to this movie.  This must have been during one of C. S. Lewis' lower depths of depression and mental ague.",1211414400,,457,4.352941176470588
1611269,4,B00005JPH2,"While I realise this was not pure C. S. Lewis, I think this film was true to the spirit (especially the Christian spirit) of his books. In fact I have found the two movies in this series to be charming and well-made. Aside from this, I find them to be in some ways more vibrant and compelling than Lewis' often wooden tales. I hope many will see this movie--consider it a vote for good family entertainment. For, in these movies we seldom experience anything approaching the self-indulgence and brattiness found in the Harry Potter films, or the frantic pacing, slang dialogue, raunch and general noise of the Disney/Pixar movies. As for the story, it is a simple good-vs-bad tale. There is no lengthy quest involved--the kings and queens merely need to rally the Narnians to repell an occupying army--but the characters keep us engaged and they are convincingly played by the actors.",1211414400,6,884,4.822368421052632
1611270,3,B00005JPH2,"Prince Caspian is darker and more violent with a lot more action than the first. However, it's less magical with less character build-up and the villians are forgettable especially compared to the White Witch. Plus some scenes you won't understand unless you read the book. Like  for instance I had no idea why the water takes the form of a bearded figure. Perhaps the book explains that but the movie doesn't. While there's also a scene where two evil creatures appear out of nowhere to try and bring the White Witch back. So yeah the direction isn't involving enough on what's going on sometimes. It's like he had too much fate in that all the viewers read the book. While action is well done but there's more action than story as well.

  The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes yet it barely takes time to tell an actual story. I mean we're supposed to care about Caspian's friendship with his dwarf tudor who taught him about Narnia. But we never see Caspian as a kid being taught by him like in the book ""I only read the beginning so far"". The movie starts off with the dwarf sending an older Caspian away to safety. While by looking at the guy you wouldn't even be able to tell that he's supposed to be a dwarf. They could've at least done some CGI magic to make him look shorter but instead we get a dwarf that looks more like Santa Clause. Maybe he's not even supposed to be a dwarf in the movie but in the book he was.

  Despite having pleanty to complain about I still enjoyed this movie. The kid actors have improved acting wise and were up to the task. Georgie Henley who plays Lucy is still the best of them though. She's probably the most magical thing about any of the movies. While Peter Dinklage (Elf, Nip/Tuck season 4) as a dwarf is one of the only new characters I really cared about. A talking mouse with a sword does get some laughs though. Even if he is a mouse version of Puss N'Boots pretty much. Hopefully though they have more character build-up, better direction and more sense of wonder and magic in the 3rd movie. So far the movies are just good when they could be excellent with the right director and writers involved.",1211328000,,2148,4.381909547738694
1611309,3,B00005JPH2,"I was very excited to have this movie came out, and I even re-read all the books in the Narnia series prior to seeing it during it's first weekend out. All in all it was an excellent movie. The actors/actresses were fantastic, the special effects were even better than the first, and the scenery was awe-inspiring.

Here's where you should stop reading if you haven't read the book or if you want to be surprised about the movie. There were many notable differences that irked me:

1)  They did not show a quarter of the beginning of the book where they showed Prince Caspian growing up and his learning of the old times and his relationship with his mentor.
2)  The soldiers did not find him in the forest the way it was projected in the movie, which also means that the circumstances around him blowing the horn is completely unrelated to the way it ""really"" was in the book.
3)  The Pevensie children did not feel responsible for everything that happened while they were gone, as the movie shows it.
4)  Susan was not present in the battles.
5)  They added a battle in the castle purely for ratings sake, that battle never happened.
6)  There was no rivalry between Peter and Caspian.
7)  There was no romance between Susan and Caspian.
8)  The White Witch, who makes an appearance in the movie, did not make an appearance in the book. Yes, they talked about bringing her back, but she never appeared and they did not even consider bringing in the dark magic like the film portrays them (in the movie they came really close to accepting the black magic, not so in the book).
9)  The fight in the beginning with Peter was purely fictious, not in the book.
10)  Aslan makes Lucy go back to the rest of them at camp and make them follow her back into the woods to meet Aslan. That does not happen in the movie. In the movie Asland just lets her off with it, doesn't make her go back and bring them with her.

The list could go on, but I just stuck with the 10 biggest differences. When I left the theatre I was very disappointed that the movie I just saw was practically no relation to the book I so dearly love.

In conclusion, if you can watch the movie and not read the book, or not compare it to the book, and simply enjoy it for what it is, then I'm sure you'll love it. If you're watching it because you expect it to be the cinematic reproduction of Prince Caspian the book, I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed.",1211328000,6,2422,4.341463414634147
1611310,5,B00005JPH2,"I first read all seven of the books about 26,000 Narnian calendar years  ago but the magic of Narnia is timeless. The stories weave around its universal themes of love, sacrifice, trust, faith and many aspects of humanity (and divinity for the Christian viewers).

Once the intense opening sequence is through, the pace of the movie slows down a little as we are re-acquainted with the Pevensie children. As they set on their quest to restore peace and freedom in the Narnian world, together with Prince Caspian and other Narnian creatures, the storyline continues at breakneck speed and consummate with the epic battle scene between the forces of good and the evil. The movie ends with a lead-in to the third installment THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Here we see Prince Caspian vowing to embark on a search for the seven lost lords, taking along with him Reepicheep the talking mouse-knight. The two younger Penvensies, Edmund and Lucy, are told that they will be brought back to Narnia in time.

The story is a lot darker than the first and the battle scenes may be a tad more violent for younger children to stomach. Although the movie does depart from the original script in a number of instances, it remains a most fantastic and fun outing for fans. Disney and Walden Media should probably consider making the other instalments back to back. Otherwise, at the current rate, it will take them another fifteen years to complete the chronicles, not to mention in astronomical Narnian terms!

This second outing no doubt is leaving fans craving for more. The music is just as magical and wonderful as the storytelling, as is the first one. As a fan, my two most eagerly awaited sequels are THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW (which is a prequel to be more exact) - how they are going to bring to life the sound and vision on the Narnia creation sequence when the great lion Aslan sings. Yes and THE FINAL BATTLE when the story is brought to an epic and climatic close.",1211328000,10,1958,4.683139534883721
1611311,4,B00005JPH2,"No one can doubt the success of the very first Chronicles of Narnia.  Prince Caspian is the fourth book in the series but it brings back the same loveable four characters from The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.  The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a good movie, although there are moments when you feel it could've reached higher.

1,300 years after the events of the first film, King Miras has a son, and is thrilled for this because he now has an heir to the throne.  The only thing standing in the way of his legacy is Prince Caspian.  He decides that he needs to get rid of Caspian and decides to assassinate him while he sleeps.  Unfortunately for Milas, Caspian has a smart professor who knows what's coming and manages to sneak Caspian out of the castle in the middle of the night.  The Prince is pursued by guards as he rides into the forbidden forest populated by the Narnians.  Unfortunately, the Narnians don't like him either for being a Telmarine.  Prince Caspian eventually blows the horn which will bring back the Kings and Queens of Narnia and thus our four heroes from the first film make their return to the land of Narnia to help Prince Caspian reclaim his throne and free the Narnians.

Much like many sequels, it's bigger than the first one.  In the beginning of the film there's a lot of exposition.  Not much of which helps to develop the characters, but does help you get a sense of what happened to Narnia since the departure of the Kings and Queens.  That may be one of the small problems with the film.  It doesn't focus too much on its characters.  We know the four from the first film, but what about the new characters?  Specifically Prince Caspian.  He's one of the main characters, but he plays a backseat to most of the films moments.  Instead it focuses on our four heroes despite that Caspian is at the focal point of the plot.  In fact, if our four heroes from the first film  hadn't shown up, you probably wouldn't be too interested in Caspian's struggle because the film neglects to flesh him out as a character.

On another note, for a PG movie, it manages to be very violent.  There's no blood flying, but there's enough death in here to bring about the question as to whether or not some of the younger kids should see this.

The movie is 144 minutes long.  Most of which is because of the battles.  The battles look incredible, but they can get a little long and tedious.  At the very least they have some incredible looking special effects. Even better than the special effects is the musical score provided for the film.  Almost everything about this movie screams epic.

The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian may not be better than the first film in the series, but it isn't too far off.  While the new characters aren't as interesting as the returning characters, the movie certainly gets a lot more things right than it does wrong.  If you liked the first movie, then chances are you'll like this one.",1211241600,2,2960,4.5093984962406015
1611312,4,B00005JPH2,"There are probably two camps who will be interested in this `Narnia' sequel:  Those who have read the C.S. Lewis allegorical fantasy series, and those who have not, but loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia-The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00005JO1X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Full Screen Edition)</a>.

To be brief, our inquisitive British children return to `Narnia' caught in a time warp that finds it in ruins and its remaining citizens dispirited and scattered.  Their enemies, the Telmarines,' have a new heir born to the throne while Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) flees for his life.  Treachery is doled out in `Hamlet' proportions, as Prince Caspian must choose sides and the children try to rebuild 'Narnia'.

Compared to 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,'  'Prince Caspian' has its ups and downs:

1. Action scenes are up, but the charm factor is down.  (Charm is diminished for a more harrowing adventure.)

2. The Pevensies (same actors) have grown older.  In cinematic years about two and a half years; by centuries in `Narnia` years.  The audience is older, too, and that's what they were probably aimin' for.

3.  Both villains deliver a real menace.  Tilda Swinton reprises her role (albeit very briefly) while seasoned actor Sergio Castellitto plays the formidable bad guy, King Miraz, head of the Telamarines.

4. Talking beavers are traded for talking badgers.  Wiley wolves are exchanged for ferocious bears.

5. Mr. Tumnus is replaced by Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) and, besides Sergio, the best new stars are the swashbuckling mice with swords.

The combat scenes are formidable.  They can't be dismissed as merely `Lord of the Ring' leftovers (although there's some correlation.)  Some will find it all too familiar, but it remains true to the book with a tension the first movie sometimes lacked, but none of the enhanced blur when Peter merely raised his sword as his army goes past.  (Undoubtedly, some will take the chicken or the hen approach, but, in all fairness, if you've seen it all before digitally, you may complain of excessive repetition despite the copyright dates of both Tolkien's and Lewis's works.)

Either way most will agree it's hard to get tired of New Zealand.  If that's not a real life `Narnia,' then nothing is.

Overall, `Prince Caspian' is an exciting, yet imperfect recreation in the `Narnia' series.  While director/ and screenplay co-author, Adam Adamson, has honed the adventure's timing admirably, the letdown happens only with what has been left behind.",1211241600,16,2673,5.492647058823529

The Pevensies take up their royal mantels as Kings and Queens of Narnia and vow to help Caspian regain his rightful crown and free the Narnians.

At least that's what I think it was about.  Honestly, there are so many Battles To The End, strange characters, and unintelligible accents that I had to content myself with understanding the basics and wishing it would end soon.  I loved the first movie; I thought the Pevensies were adorable, the creatures of Narnia were charming, and Aslan was magnificent, but all that's changed here:  The kids don't get a chance to be kids or interact on a normal level so there's not much opportunity to feel like I knew them.  A (poorly-drawn) CGI badger and a sour-puss dwarf are the main Narnians.  Neither touched me; in fact, the dwarf was off-putting.  And Aslan - ah, I wanted him to be Perfect again and bring me to tears, but, alas, he's also poorly-drawn and we see very little of him.  When we do, it's just not the same.

The scenery is breathtakingly gorgeous, but there are just too many intense battles against villains who all look and speak alike (why couldn't they have nice British accents!?)  There's nothing cuddly-cute about Narnia or awesomely divine about Aslan and the kids are reduced to killing machines.

1611315,5,B00005JPH2,"Following the box-office success that was 'The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe,"" director Andrew Adamson and his production team had a battle ahead; to make a sequel worthy of both C.S. Lewis' treasured classic and the previous film installement.

'Prince Caspian' does both, answering the call in a visually and emotionally fantastic film. Ben Barnes and Peter Dinklage lead the excellent new cast, joining the talented stars of the first film.

'Caspian' sports improved acting over it's prequel, as the young stars have grown (both in stature and talent) with their characters. Better yet, the battles of 'Caspian' are exciting and well-paced, featuring excellent fighting sequences that push the PG rating to the max, in a good way; While the battles are not really visually violent, as there isn't a lot of blood and gore, they are conceptually violent, as the conflict and carnage can be felt much more intensely than in the first film. This leads to a stronger emotional attachment and realization of the stakes, and more exciting fights. Superb choreography as well.

Ben Barnes, who from the previews I assumed would be annoying, is engaging as the title character. Whenever he wasn't on screen, I wanted him to be, and when he was, I was glad. An excellent performer.

Sergio Castellitto's performance as King Miraz is, too, worth praise. Simply said; he plays the villain well.

An excellent piece of filmaking, anyway that I can look at it. I would recommend seeing it if you have the time for it's 2 and a half hours, and I think that you will enjoy it, too.",1211155200,3,1573,4.854477611940299

1611317,4,B00005JPH2,"In 2005, Disney and Walden Media took a gamble and produced a big-budget, special-effects heavy theatrical version of C.S. Lewis' classic story, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The tremendous success of that film paved the way for both companies to film the remaining books in the franchise, starting with the second entry, PRINCE CASPIAN. (Actually, it's chronologically the fourth entry in the series, but that's time for another discussion.) The four children from the previous entry, Lucy, Susan, Edmond, and Peter, are called back to Narnia to do battle against the Telmarines and their ruthless ruler, Miraz. They do this with the help of the title character of this tale, Prince Caspian, who naturally turns out to be the rightful heir to Narnia's throne.

One of the biggest assets about this sequel is the feel of consistency. Andrew Adamson returns to the director's chair, as do the principal actors (the Pevensie children, Liam Neeson as Aslan) and the special effects team. The adaptation of the story itself is another matter. While THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE proved to be successful in transitioning Lewis' tale to the screen, PRINCE CASPIAN was tricker. The structure of the story, half of which is an extensive flashback on the title character and his kingdom, reads better on paper than on film. A previous adaptation by BBC TV was aware of this, and cut down the story to an hour, while cutting back and forth between the children and Caspian, providing for a faster pace.

Adamson's reinterpretation uses the same technique, only it omits many sequences from the original in the process; to be fair, the BBC version did this too, but some of the deletions here include character-building sequences between Caspian and his teacher, Dr. Corneilius (which the BBC version kept intact). As such, their relationship on screen feels somewhat rushed and not fully developed. For replacement, the script opts for development between two of the least well-defined children from the original--Peter and Susan. The former is more conflicted than the first (and even has a bit of a rivalry with Caspian), while the latter becomes more of a heroic figure, taking charge for the archers of Narnia. There are also a few (very scanty) flirting sequences between Susan and Caspian. These alterations may be cause for alarm with many fans of the book, but fear not--they don't come across as clumsy as they could have.

If one can accept the changes made in the transition to the screen, then it is easier to appreciate PRINCE CASPIAN as a whole. The story still remains faithful in spirit, if not letter, to the original, and the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable. The CGI effects are drastically improved from the first film (Aslan in particular looks much more regal here), and the performances are splendidly done. All four of the Pevensie children show skill and enthusiasm for their roles (even William Moseley, who seemed a little stiff in the previous outing, steps up dramatically in transitioning Peter's growth into manhood), and Ben Barnes makes for a dashing, heroic Prince Caspian (although at times his fleeting Spanish accent is somewhat reminiscent of Inigo Montoya from THE PRINCESS BRIDE). Sergio Castellitto makes for an adequate villain, but not as memorable as Tilda Swinton's White Witch (who incidentally makes a brief appearance in an exhilarating scene I won't spoil for obvious reasons).

However, the characters who steal the show are the animals. Aside from Aslan, the film's highlight is a swashbuckling mouse warrior named Reepicheep, brought to life with vibrant animation and a lively vocal performance by Eddie Izzard. Equally noteworthy are Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin the dwarf and Warwick Davis (yep, Willow Ufgood himself) in a brief but memorably nasty role as the corrupt dwarf Nikabrik.

Despite not being as successful a transition as its predecessor, PRINCE CASPIAN is still great fun. It's not another LORD OF THE RINGS (even though there are some similarities to be had; namely the big battle sequence at the end), but for escapist simplistic fantasy, I don't hesitate to recommend it. Adamson has stated that he would be passing the director's chair to someone else for the next installment, THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER. Hopefully it will be every bit as good as these two entries are. (Word of note: this is pretty violent for a PG movie; parents should be cautioned.)",1211155200,,4441,5.028532608695652
1611318,4,B00005JPH2,"On Friday, May 16th, eager Narnia fans packed out the seats in theaters around the country to have their first glimpse at Prince Caspian, the second of C.S. Lewis' beloved series to be brought to the big screen. With a budget reportedly 20 million more than its predecessor at $200 million, expectations of what magic director Andrew Adamson and crew would dish out were running high. As the opening scene of Queen Prunaprismia giving birth played out, you could almost hear the thoughts running through everyone's heads. Would Prince Caspian be as good as the first movie? Would they stay true to the book?

In this story the Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy have aged a year in England, but when they're magically transported back to Narnia they find 1300 years has passed. The land in which they grew up as Kings and Queens - The Golden Age of Narnia -- is no more. Everything and everyone they once held dear is gone. All the old Narnians (the dwarves, Centaurs, talking animals, and the like) have gone into hiding, and the Telmarines who invaded Narnia shortly after the Pevensies disappeared from the land, rule with an iron fist. But there's still hope. Queen Susan's horn is blown, and the Pevensies are called back to help a young prince claim his throne and fight the darkness and evil hovering over Narnia.

Reprising their roles as the Pevensies, William Mosley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan), Skandar Keynes (Edmund) and Georgie Henley (Lucy) take center stage again in Prince Caspian. But their sense of wonder and innocence found in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has been replaced with confusion and inner turmoil, most notably in Peter. It hasn't been easy becoming a man in Narnia and then returning to England as a boy, and this is evident in his struggles. Susan is less the questioning, know-it-all girl and more the confident, warrior woman. She wields her bow and finds herself in hand-to-hand combat during several battles (a slight but welcome diversion from the book in which Susan and Lucy were never allowed to participate in the fights). Edmund has also matured into a stalwart warrior, his brother's right-hand man. Lucy is still the wonderful, trusting soul of before only this time she's a little bolder at times and stands up for what she believes. All have clearly grown up, but not so much that we can't jump right in and follow our friends in this new adventure.

Tilda Swinton played the White Witch of the first film so masterfully (she does make a cameo in this one too), it was hard to imagine anyone else embodying evil to the same degree. But Sergio Castellitto as King Miraz comes oh, so close. There's nothing redeemable about this character (except perhaps his love for his son), and some actors might find that restricting. Sergio takes it and runs, able to exhibit both calm manipulation and rage all in the same scene.

Though only a boy in C.S. Lewis' story, 26-year-old Ben Barnes was given the difficult task of playing the title character of the film. His age is certainly a forgivable change. By the film's end we can't imagine anyone other than him in the role.

Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin and Warwick Davis as Nikabrik were also terrific cast choices. Dinklage is a master at delivering dead-pan one-liners, and Davis had some in this film as well. Anyone worrying about how they'd create Reepicheep need not have worried. The mouse comes out as valiant and humorous as we remember him. But Trufflehunter the Badger was my favorite CGI creation this time around. I felt like Lucy when I muttered to my sister Tracy in the theater, ""He's so cute!""

If you thought the cinematography in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was breath-taking, Prince Caspian's is even more so. From the gorgeous mountains and crystal clear waters of New Zealand to the lush forests of the Czech Republic, they all give the film that other-worldly feel. It's not hard to picture yourself right in the middle of Narnia.

Websites and fan forums have been buzzing about how the screenwriters and filmmakers had to adapt the original Prince Caspian story for the big screen. Director Andrew Adamson and others have talked about the added castle raid scene, for example, which isn't found in the book. These type of additions are understandable. There were changes in the first film too. But here in Prince Caspian I felt like perhaps everyone tried a little too hard to heighten the suspense. Granted, the original pacing of the novel was very slow. I remember as a kid finding it the hardest of the seven to read. I knew they'd need to cut out some of the drier parts and add some excitement. But, I didn't expect some of the key elements to be missing.

That's not to say Prince Caspian isn't a terrific fantasy film. If you haven't read the book, then you'll love it. If you have read the book and don't care about these sort of things, then you too will find nothing but good in this movie. There's adventure, unexpected but welcome humor (watch for a scene with Reepicheep and a cat), and lots of battles. All the essence of the story has been retained. That's the important part.

However, Narnia purists might have a few objections. Because of its non-stop pace, there's little time to truly get to know some of the key players before they're thrust into another battle. Take Doctor Cornelius. Our first introduction to him is when he rescues Caspian from Miraz's clutches in the middle of the night. There are no secret meetings on the roof discussing the Old Narnians. We don't see how important a role he's played in Caspian's life thus far, so there's less of an emotional pull when Caspian has to leave him. Caspian's old nurse isn't even mentioned.

We're also given little time to enjoy the other Narnian creatures like Patterwig the squirrel (I don't believe he's even named in the film), The Bulgy Bears, and Giant Wimbleweather. We're expected to care about them without given time to know them. Even Aslan's role is smaller than it seems like it should be. He doesn't lead the Pevensies down into the gorge as in the book. He only appears toward the end of the film.

A worry some fans had was the hinted attraction between Caspian and Susan in the trailers. Though also not in the book, rest assured. It doesn't go any further than being hinted at. Susan does kiss him goodbye (just once), but it's in front of her siblings and Aslan, so it's quite pure.

The subtle spiritual message of Prince Caspian about trusting and believing in things you can't see won't be lost on Christian viewers, and it's refreshing to see movies being made that aren't afraid to include that element. C.S. Lewis would be proud that his little books are impacting so many. Fantasy and adventure movie lovers won't want to miss Prince Caspian. It's a great kick-off to the summer movie season for families and Narnia fans alike.

I never understood the hype about the first Narnia movie; it really wasn't anything more than a 3 star film, hardly worth gushing over. Not Prince Caspian though, the second installment of films based on C.S. Lewis's classic books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia/dp/0066238501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>.

1,300 years have passed since the kings and queens of Narnia, Peter the High King, Lucy, Susan and Edmund left Narnia. In the time since, a race of men called the Telmarins have invaded the peaceful nation of Narnia and driven the magical inhabitants, the talking beasts, the dwarfs, centaurs, minotaur's, griffins, everything into hiding, fearing for their lives. Prince Caspian is the rightful heir to the thrown of Telmar but his scheming uncle Miraz has just had a son, a son he hopes will someday become king. In order to make this happen, however, he must first get rid of the rightful king, which sets off a chain of events eventually leading to an uprising of the Narnian people against the savage rule of the Telmarin rulers.

Prince Caspian is a magical film which is, in every way, the previous films' better. Beautiful landscaping is so common in epic fantasies like this that it's almost a clich&eacute; but here it doesn't seem like a mere LOTR copy like so many others.  It's landscaping is neatly done, playing up the differences between Lewis's fantasy world and Tolkien's. The ruins of Cair Paravel, the beaches, Aslan's Howl, are all wonderfully realized. The story begins when our four kings and queens of old are summoned to Narnia, when Caspian blows Susan's horn. They are transported to their former dwelling, the castle Cair Paravel, only to find it in ruins and decay. Meeting up with a dwarf they rescue from death, they make their way across the wilderness of Narnia to meet Caspian.

The power struggle between Caspian and ""High King"" Peter gives this movie great tension early on. Caspian is somewhat unsure of himself, having never led men into battle, and allows his will to be overturned by strong opponents. While Peter, by contrast, seems is too sure of himself because of his former status as ""High King"" and often times refuses to take the advice of others, namely Lucy, whom as testified to in the previous film should always be believed. Peter also refuses to heed Caspian, who's command Peter tries to usurp out of pure spite and pride. It destroys the moral of their soldiers to see their leaders do nothing but bicker and for a while this is all that these two ""wannabe"" kings accomplish.

But the show stealer for this film is not the kings, the centaurs, the giant castles or even Aslan the lion but Reepicheep, a buccaneer like mouse who refuses to let his tiny little size get in the way of glory, honor and pride. Running through the ranks of Telmar soldiers he cuts them off at the knees, asks them for their final words and when they mention the obvious, ""Your a mouse"" he frustratingly replies, ""oh, you humans have no imagination."" There are few characters in any movie that are as fun to watch as Reepicheep, his antics and overly prideful sense of himself, despite his size is, as Lucy says, ""so cute,"" but don't say that in front of him. I cannot wait to see him back in the next film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Combine all this with some amazing choreographed fight scenes and this is one amazing film.

The only fault I can find in Caspian, if you can call it a fault, is that it comes AFTER The Lord of the Rings. So many plot elements have already been used in LOTR, unfortunately. So although I don't want to penalize this film for that, it does come up repeatedly. Peter and Caspian reaching for power like Boromir reaching for the ring, Susan pulling off her best Legolas impression, the water figure washing away the Telmar horses as they try to cross the river. Yes, it's true to the book for the most part, but it did seem very ringish in many parts.

Prince Caspian is not going to be the best film of the year when all is said and done, but it does stand a high chance of standing up there with the best films of 2008. Although it does hold a lot of LOTR elements, I can't really fault it for that since LOTR pretty much did everything, and did everything well. I can only hold my breath for when the much awaited film, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader comes out. I will  be waiting for this, The Silver Chair, and possibly The Last Battle.

1611340,5,B00005JPH2,"Andrew Adamson is a genius!  He has depicted faithfully, the Narnia that we ""of a certain age"" grew up with. The Casting is brilliant (both movies) and the special effects unbelievably realistic.  All in all, this has been the best movie I have seen for 2008.  In fact, I went twice and plan to go again.
I didn't quite agree with the ""AA"" rating, as I don't find this totally acceptable for children under 12/13.  There is plenty fighting and though no blood or gore, there is some beheading and much death.
Though depicted as ""book 2"" Prince Caspian is actually book 4 and followed by ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" which gives us Aslan, Caspian, Reepicheep, Lucy, Edmund & introducing their cousin Eustace.  I cannot WAIT to see Adamsons' efforts with this and can only surmise, it would be better than the first two!",1211155200,,822,4.602739726027397
1611341,3,B00005JPH2,"I had thrills as the movie began.  The directors so accurately brought my imagination to life.  The ruins of Cair Paravel were exactly on target.  Here we were, after two years, back in Narnia- but with excellent CGI.  The acting by the children, especially Lucy, was great.  Nearly every mythological creature was exquisitely crafted, and Trumpkin the Dwarf and Reepicheep the mouse steal the show.

You may notice I haven't talked much about the story.  It's probably because they didn't actually follow the plot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-book/dp/006122765X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis' book</a>.

That was unfortunate.  The directors decided there needed to be more action, so they added a twenty minute attacking of a castle.  This scene is nowhere in the book, but its addition accomplishes two things.  It makes the movie much more focused on violence and warfare than the book was.  And it reduces the amount of time available to spend on character development.

Lewis' book had a great deal of character development.  In fact, its probably the most character driven of the Narnia series.  This is perhaps why the BBC decided to combine the book with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Voyage-of-the-Dawn-Treader/dp/0060764945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a>.  In the book we get to hear about the difficult decision to decide who is sent as representative to the duel, and whether a bear that sucks his paw would look intimidating to the enemy.  In the movie we get a brief image of a bear sucking his paw with no explanation.  There wasn't time to explain, because they spent so much time attacking the castle.

Lewis writes a story about the need for justice and assisting the outcast.  Reviewers write about how the Pevensies are taught to resort to violence, because in the movie violence becomes much the central option.  Principally, the attack on the castle was preemptive on the part of the Narnians- something not attempted in the movie.  Indeed, the only one who mentions it in the book is Reepicheep, in a moment where we see how sometimes the mouse is too foolhardy.

The movie feels like one action scene after another, with the end result a foregone conclusion.  Gone are the allusions and allegory of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-the-Witch-and-the-Wardrobe/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a>.  Not to suggest those were missing from the book.  For Lewis crafts his book carefully to discuss in detail the meaning of faith, with long segments on how the Pevensies can learn to trust Aslan is there with them, even if they can't see him.  There is the oft-repeated theme that the most trusting are the ones who can lead, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Soul-of-Prince-Caspian-Exploring-Spiritual-Truth-in-the-Land-of-Narnia/dp/0781445280/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Soul of Prince Caspian: Exploring Spiritual Truth in the Land of Narnia</a>&nbsp;reveals.  The movie only casts allusions to this.  In the book, Trumpkin denies the existence of Aslan.  In the movie, he suggests that Aslan is never around for them.  This severely reduces the drama of the final scene when Aslan meets Trumpkin.  It is as if the directors felt that that whole faith thing that Lewis was on about was just not appropriate for their movie, so they need to take it out.  This is unfortunate, for it is quite clear in the book that Aslan is the primary character- whether he is seen or unseen.  The directors also evidently didn't seem to like the idea of a bad witch as that was too un-PC, and changed her into a strange bird creature.  In their attempt to create a Harry Potter look-alike, they have taken Lewis' novel and made it a pitiful imitation.

I must say though, Prince Caspian is probably the weakest of the seven books in the series.  It's hard to put it on the screen.  But if you can get through this, you can easily do the rest of the movies.  However, the directors should have made a decision to stick to the spirit of Lewis, and make a movie that was character driven rather than a copy of Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe.

The directors also did a good job in some changes, like adding humor, love interest, and putting women more in the thick of battle.  It was a true pleasure to exit the theatre and hear a troop of young boys arguing about who got to be the brave Lucy. You don't often get girls as the role model for young boys.

The end of it all is that you should see the movie, for the special effects.  But before you do, read the book, which is superbly better, and far more philosophically coherent.  And directors, please, please, please, don't disembowl the next Narnia films.  Maintain respect for the wishes of the author you are making so much money off of.",1211068800,4,4980,5.312020460358056
1611342,5,B00005JPH2,"I've read and heard numerous complaints about ""The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian.""  Two of the primary ones are that a) the magic is gone and b) the film is too violent.  For those who've actually read the stories that this film and the previous one are based on, this should come as no surprise.  ""Caspian"" is intentionally a darker, more violent and ""magic-less"" film.  It's a story where the children (except young Lucy for the most part) turn away from the aid of Aslan in an attempt to do things on their own.  Of course, things never go quite right without Aslan.

In this tale, we find Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan literally called back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful king of the Telmarine empire, reclaim his future throne.  It's been stolen from him by his uncle, Miraz, who plans to become king.  Two great battles, as well as one very dramatic and violent face-off take place, all in an attempt to reclaim the throne.  To tell any more would be to ruin the tale.

The story has been edited for pacing, and although it's been a little while since I read this particular tale, I'm sure that one particular battle sequence was added.  There are also a couple of changes to characters that I don't recall in the original story.  In the end though, the key elements of the story are all there.  The Christian undertones are also present, but aren't as obvious as they were in the first film.  Those familiar with the Christian aspects of the story should pick up on them though.

Families with especially young children may want to preview this film before taking their little ones.  My daughter, who's seven, had no problem with the story and wasn't scared at all.  Yes, it is grittier, more violent and has less magic in it, but this is a good adaptation of ""Prince Caspian.""  I do believe that the poetic license doesn't add much to the film, but it doesn't take anything away from the key elements of the story.  Overall, it's a highly enjoyable tale that I highly recommend to fans of fantasy, Christians, and anybody who enjoys a good story.",1211068800,2,2078,4.564864864864865
1611343,5,B00005JPH2,"As a child (probably over 30 years ago now), I read the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA every couple of years.  I loved the books, and at that time, they seemed like fast moving, exciting adventures to me.  Looking at them these days...they are charming but a little slow-paced for a modern audience.  I still highly recommend them as an introduction to epics for younger children (kids too young for LORD OF THE RINGS, for example)...but I also admit that they aren't exactly barn-burners.

This was further borne out when I saw the made-for-TV British versions a few years ago.  While very faithful to the books...they moved at a glacial pace (and the special effects were pretty awful).  My kids couldn't get through them.

So that's the main reason I so much appreciate the latest versions of these great stories.  Part 1, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was very faithful to the original...yet added some epic action sequences to jazz up modern audiences.  My biggest problem with that film was the sometimes poor special effects (I thought The Beavers were pretty badly done...to the point of distraction) and I thought James McAvoy was poorly cast as Mr. Tumnus...again a big distraction.  I thought the kids were very good, and Tilda Swinton was probably the perfect person for her role.  I liked the movie...but I didn't love it.

I almost love PRINCE CASPIAN, though.  For one thing, it's nice to see another book in the series getting loving attention.  Second, the four young leads have really grown as performers.  (Although the young man playing Edmund has grown just a tiny bit too much...no fault of his.)  I particularly liked both of the young actresses.  Susan is truly a young woman you would NOT want to mess with in a fight...she's empowered but not the least bit showy about it.  And Lucy is perfect...we believe she is always the one who keeps one eye out for Aslan.

The kids return to Narnia after one year back on our earth...and 1300 years have gone by.  Their old palace is in ruins, and they quickly discover that a race of humans called the Telmarines have driven the ""magical"" denizens of Narnia out of their own land.  The current leader of Narnia is so cruel, in fact, that he has driven his own nephew Caspian (and rightful heir) out of Narnia and into the woods.  There Caspian meets his destiny.

PRINCE CASPIAN is populated with delightful creations.  The dwarves are a delight...Peter Dinklage is an actor of considerable gravity and subtlety...and gives a heartbreaking performance.  Reepicheep the Mouse appears and steals his scenes...just as he does in the book.  There are badgers, mighty Centaurs, fearsome Minotaurs, etc.  Most of them are rendered better than in the first movie, and there were only a few moments where the CGI wasn't quite up to the task.  For the most part, these creatures felt very much like physical presences.

Naturally, the book's modest action scenes are greatly enhanced for the film.  While the ending battles are truly spectacular and actually quite exciting...I enjoyed the sneak attack on the Telmarine fortress almost as much.  Not only was it exciting...it had emotional resonance.  The great High King Peter and the up-and-comer Caspian both get taken down a peg or two...at a great cost.

I hate to reveal any more plot...because most kids are far less familiar with this story than the first.  It isn't exactly a groundbreaking plot...but it's done very well and will engage kids and adults alike.  It is rated PG...but I almost think PG-13 would have been more appropriate...it is VERY violent, and lots of people die.

There are some weaknesses, of course...Ben Barnes as Caspian needs some maturing.  He looks the part, and no doubt is quite a handsome young man...but his acting skills are not up to his fellow-young people.  Perhaps if he returns in a sequel...he'll add some gravitas.  Also, the movie is just a little slow going early on.  One or two scenes of voyaging or trudging through woods could easily have been eliminated.  Once the film kicks into high gear, though...it's pretty terrific.  The script itself is fairly faithful to the book and serves its purpose...but it's not transformative.

By no means is this film the masterwork that THE LORD OF THE RINGS series was.  It has just a little childish edge to it...which is appropriate.  Nonetheless, I heartily recommend it.  If you liked the first film...you'll love this one.  If you were only so-so on the first film...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how this one grows.

The best sign, to me, that I liked the film was that five minutes after it was over...I was very sad knowing it would be years before VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER comes.  I EAGERLY await that film...with its epic action sequences set at sea.",1211068800,,4771,4.816502463054187
1611344,2,B00005JPH2,"I have been a huge C. S. Lewis and Narnia fan practically all my life. I loved the new adaptation of LWW and was really looking forward to seeing Prince Caspian. There are some things that were captured very well, such as the lovable feisty characters of Reepicheep and the dwarf Trumpkin, and the culture of the Telmarines. Lucy and Edmund were in top form. And the visuals - the special effects, costumes, etc - were superb.

But I was disappointed that they took so many departures from the book. There were some departures in LWW as well, but not quite so many. It seems most of the professional critics think the filmmakers ""improved"" on C. S. Lewis' plotting, but I disagree. I believe these differences cheapened Lewis' story.

First of all, Peter was not nearly such a mess-up in the book. The only mistake he made in the book was not listening to Lucy at first when she tried to convince them that Aslan was telling them to go a certain way through the woods. He never got in a fight in the train station. He didn't plan or execute an ill-fated raid on Miraz' castle (that whole scene was an invention of the filmmakers; there was no castle raid in the book and no Narnians died in vain). And he was always respectful of Caspian; they never had any sort of `power struggle.' He relied on Aslan to be the main savior of Narnia, not himself. It was his idea to challenge Miraz to a duel, not Caspian's. This excerpt from the book shows how far the movie went away from the book in all these ways:

""Now,"" said Peter... ""Aslan and the girls are somewhere close. We don't know when he will act. In his time, no doubt, not ours. In the meantime he would like us to do what we can on our own. You say, Caspian, we are not strong enough to meet Miraz in pitched battle.""

""I'm afraid not, High King,"" said Caspian. He was liking Peter very much, but was rather tongue-tied.

...""Very well, then,"" said Peter, ""I'll send him a challege to single combat."" No one had thought of this before.

""Please,"" said Caspian, ""could it not be me? I want to avenge my father.""

""You're wounded,"" said Peter. ""And anyway, wouldn't he just laugh at a challenge from you? I mean, we have seen that you are a king and a warrior but he thinks of you as a kid.""

Second, Susan wasn't anti-social or giving boys a fake name to put them off. She was actually much more of a brat than Peter in the book; she was mean to Lucy and wouldn't believe Lucy had seen Aslan. She and Lucy went together, with Aslan, to destroy the bridge at Beruna (which was a town with people in it). And Caspian was most certainly between 10 and 14 years old in the book and presumably too young for Susan; there was no hint of any romantic interest.

Third, Aslan was much more of a presence in the book. He was a constant presence from when he led the four siblings and Trumpkin to Caspian's hideout, till the end of the book. I was disappointed that this was not the case in the movie, because Aslan is by far my favorite character in the stories, and Lewis' intent was that he be central to the story, since he is God in lion form in that world.

Fourth, the movie almost seemed like nothing but near-constant battle scenes with loud dramatic music. They added the extra invented castle battle scene, and left out several `non-battle' events in the book, such as Lucy and Susan freeing the town of Beruna, and two celebratory parties hosted by Aslan. I don't know if maybe this is because they were trying to make it more LOTR-ish, or more appealing to the male population, or what. But it was annoying and felt very unbalanced.

The third book, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" is my favorite in the Narnia series. I hope they see fit to stick more closely to the book. Although that's hard to imagine, since - gasp - there are no battle scenes in that book! Whatever will they do?? Invent some, I guess.",1211068800,11,3867,4.356944444444444
1611345,5,B00005JPH2,"""The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is great! This is how the story goes: One year later, the Kings and Queens of Narnia find themselves back in that faraway wondrous realm, only to discover that more than 1,300 years have passed in Narnian time. During their absence, the Golden Age of Narnia has become extinct and Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines and is now under the control of the evil King Miraz, who rules the land without mercy. The four children will soon meet a curious new character: Narnia's rightful heir to the throne, the young Prince Caspian, who has been forced into hiding, as his uncle Miraz plots to kill him in order to place his own newborn son on the throne. With the help of the kindly dwarf, a courageous talking mouse named Reepicheep, a badger named Trufflehunter and a Black Dwarf, Nikabrik, the Narnians--led by the mighty knights Peter and Caspian--embark on a remarkable journey to find Aslan, rescue Narnia from Miraz's tyrannical hold, and restore magic and glory to the land. The directing by Andrew Adamson (who also directed ""Shrek"" (2001) & ""Shrek 2"" (2004, also wrote the screenplay and story), he also did the screenplay and directed ""The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe"" (2005) is great!

1611346,5,B00005JPH2,parents take note. even though this movie was made by Disney like its predecessor THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE doesn't mean that it's still appropriate for all ages. the storyline is much darker as it deals with treachery and treason and the thirst for vengeance. the fight scenes are pretty intense as there are numerous casualties. those expecting Aslan to be in the whole movie might be disappointed but he does come back at a crucial point. The brothers/sisters are left on their own as they forge an uneasy alliance with Prince Caspian. Parents should see this movie first before deciding on whether or not to allow children aged 12 and under to go. if it was up to me i'd rate it PG-13 like the Pirates Of The Caribean movies were. thank you for your time in reading this.,1210982400,,785,4.535211267605634
1611347,4,B00005JPH2,"""Prince Caspian,"" the second installment in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series, takes place one year AND 1,300 years after ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The Kings and Queens of Narnia, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, have only been absent from their kingdom for one year in London time. However, when they are suddenly called back to the magical world, they discover that 1,300 years have passed since their reign. The Narnia they knew is now in ruins, and the throne rightfully belongs to the young Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Unfortunately, Caspian is on the run from his uncle Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), who is determined to kill his nephew, take the throne for himself, and secure a royal future for his newborn son. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy eventually join forces with Caspian and attempt to reclaim the throne and restore Narnia to what it once was.

I enjoyed this movie, but not nearly as much as the first film in the series. Part of the reason for that is because ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" has always been my favorite book in the C.S. Lewis series, so I knew ""Prince Caspian"" wouldn't measure up for me. However, I still think the film itself had some shortcomings. The filmmakers took more liberties with this film than with the last one. Certain things happen out of sequence, and other parts of the film were changed slightly just for the sake of changing them, which really bothers me. Also, the whole Susan/Caspian romance is NOT in the book, and it really pisses me off that Disney felt the need to throw some cheesy love story into the mix of things. (I also hated the sappy, crappy music that played at the end of the film. It was totally out of place. Yuck.)

Still, there are a lot of positive things about the movie as well. The battle scenes are fantastic and the special effects are outstanding. Barnes and Castellitto are the stars of this movie, and they deliver very strong performances. Eddie Izzard provided the voice for Reepicheep the mouse, which was a pleasant surprise. One of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the White Witch returns for a few minutes, and Tilda Swinton appears in a brief cameo. Liam Neeson also returns to provide the voice of Aslan, but the lion is absent from most of the film, and I remember him being present in the book a bit more...why in the world would they cut Aslan's scenes from the film?! He's the best part of the whole story!

All things considered, ""Prince Caspian"" is a good movie, but it lacks some of the magic from the first ""Narnia"" film. Bummer.",1210982400,82,2565,4.608315098468271
1611348,5,B00005JPH2,"This is a really good movie, and I highly recommend it! (Although I would suggest that if you do go, leave some of the younger ones at home...This was a PG and 1/2)
""Prince Caspian"" was really good- they stuck mostly to the plot of the book by C.S. Lewis, with a few add-ins or changes. This is more violent than the first one (which is why I called it a PG and 1/2), but there is not actual graphic violence. By that I mean, even though, as some others mentioned, there is a beheading scene and several other slightly disbturbing scenes, the actual beheading is almost implied...It's not like scary movie gore and blood.
Although there were sometimes that it was hard to understand the actors, most of the dialogue was clear and the graphics were well done. The acting was also pretty good (with occasional blah moments). The effects were fantastic, and there were many witty and humorous lines throughout the movie.
If you've seen the first movie, you definitely should go to see this. It is well worth the money, and although it is 2 hours, it doesn't feel like it.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and plan to buy it when it comes out on DVD.",1210982400,,1145,4.457142857142857
1611379,2,B00005JPH2,"Unfortunately, I respectfully disagree with some of the other commentators. I don't think this movie was particularly good. It was considerably violent -- Despite the caution taken to not show much blood, innumerable people/creatures are killed, even by our heroes. But the non-stop battles don't serve to advance the plot much, and there is poor, if any, real character development. While I loved the books and enjoyed the first movie, sadly, I could hardly wait until this second installment was over. Hopefully they'll do better next time.",1210982400,10,542,5.241379310344827
1611380,4,B00005JPH2,"I suppose the biggest surprise most viewers who aren't familiar with the books got was how quickly the story becomes darker and much more serious. But, that's C. S. Lewis's point. Even a beautiful, magical place like Narnia can transform and become a place you barely recognize. Narnia does continue to change each time the children travel to this magical country. They learn, as we do, to expect these drastic changes. You do get to meet wonderful characters like Mr. Tumnus and Reepicheep, (my personal favorite) but you also see a lot of evil too.  Yes, this film was violent. It would have been nice to forewarn parents that this was not a film for younger children. Surprisingly, the film appears to be not rated. I wonder who dropped the ball on this one.

But, I suppose the biggest challenge that Andrew Adamson, the director, had to face was that several people had an expectation and picture of Narnia in their minds when they stepped into the theatres. Just as I'm sure readers did when they opened the book Prince Caspian. I wonder if they were similarly outraged. However, if you see how these stories progress you'll see why this plot line really does make sense in the large scheme of things. Think about any sequel in a fantasy series. The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers or The Chamber of Secrets. They are all much darker than the original film in the series. But, the sequel sets up the viewers for the rest of the series and prepares you to take a darker journey. Then, when the heroes rise victorious you are more than willing to hail The Return of the King and the Return of the Jedi as major successes.

Prince Caspian is part of the journey that the Narnians, the Pevensie children, viewers, and other characters still to come have to go on to reach the ultimate goal. Yes, there were a couple of dramatic licenses taken to further the plot line that drew away from the book. However, I think they did a fine job of developing some of the characters and capturing others. I am however interested in finding out if there's an extended edition that'll be available when it's released on DVD. I wonder if that's where the rest of the character development went. Especially considering the time and care Andrew Adamson typically takes with Narnia. I'd be surprised to hear there won't be one available.

I hope you all enjoy this movie, but please understand that Narnia is no longer going to be viewed with rose tinted glasses. There's a reason for this evil presence in Narnia, but I'm afraid you'll have to read the books to find out the answer to that one.",1210982400,,2584,4.598698481561822
1611381,4,B00005JPH2,"*** This review contains spoilers adn this has turned into almost an essay. A thousand pardons ***

I happened to take 3 cousins last night to the film and we enjoyed it a full theatre. All three, the 15 year old boy, the 11 year old girl and 7 year old boy, were enrapted by the film, and although they thought it was much different and darker than the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, they weren't scared. The 7 year old reacted once to a very tense scene (Caspian has the option of killing his uncle after Peter vanquishes Miraz), but later remarked that he loved the movie.

Some reviews have said Prince Caspian is dumbed down. I would argue it was right in spirit of the book and true to real life. It features a horribly wicked man who has already murdered his brother and now wants to murder his nephew for the sake of the crown and that's straight from the book. Also fits in perfectly with world history and politics. Narnians were in hiding because they were being badly persecuted in the book too, and, because this was a very well made film, we are shown the persecution, not just told about it. The depth of Peter and Susan's at their first separation in the first place are explored. And if you know Susan's eventual fate at the end of book 7, her pride and anger at Aslan are almost understandable.

As for the violence: It was more violent and dark than LW&W and a kid of about 7 or younger would be far too scared, but I do remember a fair amoung of mentioned violence in the novel. (I actually thought the scary factor in LW&W was toned down too much).

For those who choose to find Christian themes (after all, Lewis was the greatest Christian apologist of our time), the violence is much less than found in the Hebrew Bible (aka the Old Testament) and the New Testament.  Remember the Biblical stories of the woman who staked a man through the head, of the numerous murders and rapes, of Jericho, the nation of Israel's escape from Egypt? Jesus died the worst kind of tortuous, humilating death on the cross. I always though CS Lewis did a wonderful job demonstrating the crappyness humanity can descend to without being grotesque for children. I think Prince Caspian was produced in the same vein.

I also think the violence puts Peter and Miraz's actions in sharp contrast to Aslan's violence-free confict management. While Peter choose fighting and Miraz and company chose murder and treachery, Aslan simply and literally washes Narnia clean. All the Telmarines, with the exception of the bad guy, are spared, too.

Also, Peter insistence on fighting, along with Susan's attitude, demonstrate CS Lewis' theme of stubborn pride in the novel. Aslan tries to appear to the children as soon as they arrive in Narnia, but only Lucy wanted to see Aslan; the other three children are too busy being mad at the fact they were taken away from Narnia.

One review said:

""Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention""

Again, Aslan was trying to get the children's attention pretty much the second they stepped foot back in Narnia. Thanks to pesky free will, they chose not to (excepting the ever faithful Lucy). He wanted to help, but Aslan, like God, is rearing faithful, brave people that must be willing to set aside their pride and jealousy so they are able to see him. Only then can he help. I am reminded of the town Jesus had to leave where he couldn't perform many miracles because of their unbelief. Oh, free will can be so inconvienent. (Man I love CS Lewis, he makes up some spiffy parallels).

Basically, we see that when people like Peter, Susan, Edmund, Caspian and even Lucy don't set aside pride, anger, guilt, or fear, people everywhere, like Narnians and Telmarines, get hurt or killed (Can we say Christian history, anyone?)

Anyway, off the soapbox and back to normal review type things:

The acting was superb. They hired very fine actors for the supporting cast. Besides being a great actor, Prince Caspian is dreamy (excuse me while I have a girly moment), and the children are much better performers than last time, as well as fine looking young adults. Eddie Izzard as the voice of Reepicheep is spot on amazing.

As for the over done medieval theme: Yeah, it is reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but CS Lewis was a Chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge (see cslewis.org) and Narnia itself is basically a medieval world. Can't really get away from the medieval theme.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves CS Lewis or JRR Tolkien, fantasy, battles, whether religious, atheiest or who doesn't care either way. You can either ignore or have fun with the religious parallels. It's very fun, as long as you are at least eight years old.

Also, I'd give it 4.5 stars. I'd only give it five stars if I could end up in Narnia at the end of the credits and I don't have to go to work on Monday.",1210982400,3,4948,4.548931383577053
1611382,3,B00005JPH2,"I liked the first Narnia film to some extent and I kind of feel the same about Prince Caspian. These films don't have the wonder or magic that the Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings series have. In fact my favorite part of the Narnia movies are all the talking animals. I seem to care about them more than the humans. There are some good things (hence the 3 stars I gave it), such as, the outstanding CGI, a nice musical score and most of the actors are above average. I just have no desire to see more of the Narnia world in the future. It is better than The Golden Compass, so it's not all bad.",1210982400,4,599,4.042016806722689
1611383,5,B00005JPH2,"I had a blast watching Disney's new episode of the beloved Narnia series. As in the first movie, it starts in an England torn by WWII. A mundane subway station magically becomes transport back to Narnia, which the children had left only a year earlier - but a mmillenium past, by that world's calendar. Their arrival signals a heroic myth returned to life.

The story thinly veils C. S. Lewis's Christian allegory. Although I haven't read the books in years, I was surprised at how much of the Christ mythos came through. Secularists (like me) need not worry, though. The fantasy unfolds beautifully even if you ignore that aspect. The effect-masters bring Narnia's population of centaurs, fauns, and other beings to life very convincingly, and the battle scenes carry all the excitement, drama, and scope one could wish. Even Susan, the older girl, joins the battle - despite long skirts, light armor, and a ladylike (but deadly) longbow, she does as well in close combat as any of the others. Lucy, the little one, truly turns the battle though. You'll see for yourself. Just wait until her baby-fatted hand draws her tiny weapon against the entire invading army - the whole course the war changes at that moment.

There's no way to know, perhaps this does carry the thrill and majesty of Lewis's vision of fiction. Either way, it gets the summer movie season off to a rousing start.

I seen this movie on this past friday@9.30 am .Me and a guest got too enjoy a private screening. The movie effect in parts suprassed its predesor in the Fx department. The battle scenes are good,and I must agree with another reviewer that i glanced at -this movie despite being Disney maybe too destrubing for younger veiwers. The fact it is Disney also gives it that goodie goodie draw back.there are few references the main one in my opinion is the sword duel between the self proclaimed king and Peter.

1611385,1,B00005JPH2,"I now understand why so many great writers will never, or only under the rarest of circumstances, allow their stories to be turned into movies while they are still alive!

There's no excuse for this  horrible adaptation! - ""The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe""  was a masterpiece,  so having the  genius to make  a C. S. Lewis story into a great film was not an issue. Nor was money! Hollywood made a lot of  cash from it's first venture into Narnia! And finding four child & teen actors with fine acting talent to play the lead roles was a smash success. So why such a violent and unimaginative Prince Caspian?

One can only speculate.  The screenplay, acting and passion are so lacking this time around that I truly wish this story never made it to the Big Screen! I feel this disaster of a film will even damage the Narnia ""brand."" Since making money seems to be Hollywood's only motivation in making this  film, they should know better!

Prince Caspian was  all about fighting and killing, and more killing and more fighting. One scene shows the slaughtering of retreating Narnians and even the deliberate killing of one's  own soldiers in the process. If  you want to see real evil in a dumbed down fashion, you'll see plenty in this movie! NOR IS THIS FILM APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! There's certainly nothing cute or delightful about Prince Caspian!

Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention. Meanwhile, Narians are being crushed to death by flying boulders, while Aslem leisurely has a chat with her about old times.  This screenplay must have been written by an Atheist or someone with a very dark sense of humor!

I frequently write reviews on films I have strong feelings about. I like to encourage people to see a good film and discourage them from seeing a bad one. Let's face it, we have so many entertainment choices. But another reason I write reviews is to congratulate Hollywood for a job well-done, or like in this case, when a film is an unmitigated disaster, I hope to affect their bottom line. Because  Hollywood is always confronted with two broad choice: To treat a story as art - with respect, passion and genius like they did in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;""  or do the opposite, and treat it like a commodity, which has the feeling of a product made on a factory assembly line! Memo to Hollywood: If you venture in Narnia again fire the current crew and bring in some fresh talent! I challenge you to make your next film one that will stand the test of time!

1611386,4,B00005JPH2,"THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA:  PRINCE CASPIAN continues the story of four children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) and their return to Narnia.  They help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) to revive the fantasy world that was once inhabited by the various talking creatures and king of the forest, Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson), after the land is invaded by the Telmarines.  And once again, there is the conflict between good and evil.

The film focuses on Prince Caspian and his quest to recapture the thrown.  However, his leadership is in question.  In this installment of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Caspian has to unite the creatures and people of Narnia and fight the Telmarines.  And one question comes to mind, is he able to return Narnia to its previous luster?  There is an array of themes within the film's storyline, leadership, chivalry, and camaraderie between the four children, Prince Caspian, and the beastly creatures, which gradually shows Caspian's strengths as well as challenges as a leader.  And this is displayed in one of the most powerful scenes in the film where Peter and King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) conduct a duel.

PRINCE CASPIAN leaves the enchantment behind.  This film is a far cry from the first CHRONICLES OF NARNIA because of the intense violence.  With the haunting chants of the movie's soundtrack, epic cinematography, extravagant costumes, there is a darker element to this film; viewers may identify the massive battle scenes to THE LORD OF THE RINGS, 300, and the previous HARRY POTTER films.  And this will definitely keep people at the edge of their seats.

Although the film has a darker tone, there are a few lighter moments.  The enchanted creatures of the forest of Narnia offer a little comic relief to the movie, such as Trumpkin the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and Reepicheep the mouse (voice of Eddie Izzard) who almost resembles the Puss n' Boots character in the Shrek films.  Another defining moment is the touching concluding scenes where Aslan and Lucy reunite as well as when the children depart from Narnia back to England.

Overall, the film is an amazing display of excitement and adventure.  However, due to too many disturbing scenes of violence within the film, it may not be appropriate for young children.  Otherwise, this is a movie worth watching.",1210896000,2,2370,5.030769230769231
1611387,4,B00005JPH2,"It's rare for a sequel to outshine the original. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is more focused, more exciting, more interesting, and much more entertaining than 2005's ""Narnia"" film, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" The main characters are less aimless and enigmatic. The story is far more engaging. Everything in general is smoother and more developed, which is wonderful for anyone in need of a good fantasy story. It shouldn't matter if you've never read any of C.S. Lewis' original books, because in all honesty, it makes absolutely no difference--one should judge this film on its own terms and not make pointless comparisons to the source material. The important thing is that it's a good movie, plain and simple. On the whole, it very nearly gave me everything the first film did not.

""Prince Caspian"" begins in the world of Narnia when Prunaprismia (Alicia Borrachero)--queen of the Telmarines--gives birth to a son. This is good news indeed for her husband, Miraz (Sergio Castellitto), because he finally has a male heir to take the place of his nephew, Prince Caspian X (Ben Barnes), who he plans to murder. Caspian's teacher, Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass), has known of Miraz's dastardly plan all along, so he helps Caspian escape into the woods; there, the young Prince is attacked and taken captive by a pair of dwarves, but not before blowing a white horn shaped like a lion's head.

This brings the story into 1950s England, where we're reintroduced to the Pevensie siblings: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). After breaking up a fight between Peter and a group of schoolboys, the four siblings are magically transported from a subway station back to Narnia. They quickly realize that things are not as they were when they left: ruins of once great structures are scattered all throughout; the trees no longer dance; the great lion Aslan is nowhere to be found, and neither are the other magical creatures. They then save a bitter dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), after which they learn the truth: while the siblings have aged only one year since leaving, Narnia has aged hundreds of years. 1300 years, to be precise. It isn't long before they meet Prince Caspian, who comes to and realizes his destiny is restore peace between the Narnians and the Telmarines.

Obviously, this has turned his world upside down. Narnia began for him as nothing more than a fairy tale; until recently, he never believed that magical creatures even existed. When he realizes that such creatures do exist, he learns that his people conquered Narnia hundreds of years ago, leading to centuries of hostility and mistrust. Since Caspian was the one that called back the Pevensies with the horn, the few remaining creatures decide to form a truce with him and work towards peace. But this can only be done with the help of the four siblings, who after 1300 years remain the rightful kings and queens of Narnia. They join with Caspian knowing that difficult times lie ahead, especially since Aslan is still missing. When a raid on Miraz's castle goes horribly wrong, tensions grow between Peter and Caspian. Both selfishly try to prove themselves when they're supposed to be allies. Peter, for one, is brave and good-hearted, but he's also impulsive, believing he never needs help because he's always in control of the situation.

On the same token, Caspian lets his hatred for Miraz overshadow his main mission, which is to help the Pevensies fight; it reaches a point when he's tempted by a dwarf named Nikabrik (Warwick Davis) to resurrect the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), whose soul is trapped in an icy netherworld. The only one who seems to have a handle on the situation is Lucy, who always hoped she would someday return to Narnia, unlike Susan, who has just begun to get used to England. Lucy clings to the hope that Aslan is somehow guiding them all towards something, even when no one else believes that she's seen him. All this eventually leads to a battle near the end of the film, one that's interwoven with a climactic swordfight between Peter and Miraz. The final part of the sequence features a creature made entirely of water, a creature so impressive I was disappointed with the filmmakers for giving it such little screen time.

Most of the film shows the same level of creativity, with talking badgers and centaurs and marching armies of trees included at one point or another to enhance the experience for the audience. Talking creatures have often been a lot of fun in fantasy stories, especially since they usually add a little comedy relief. The funniest character in ""Prince Caspian"" is a talking mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard), who, despite his size, is actually quite skilled with a sword, even if it's no bigger than a pencil--""Yes, I'm a mouse,"" he says just before slitting the throat of a castle guard. Even if that one moment was more disturbing than it was funny, I still feel that, overall, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" is a wonderful fantasy adventure. I finally felt the magical spark that eluded me in ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" an ambitious and well-intentioned film with an unfocused, underdeveloped story. I can't say how well made future ""Narnia"" films will be, but there's reason to hope for the best if they follow the same trend as ""Prince Caspian.""",1210896000,4,5423,4.9094874591057795
