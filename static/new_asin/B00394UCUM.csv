8391951,5,B00394UCUM,"~ Recorded in-studio before a small audience for the BBC show ""Jazz 625"", this DVD features Art Farmer (flugelhorn), Jim Hall (Guitar), Steve Swallow (bass), and Pete LaRoca (drums). Although the headline artist is Art Farmer, guitarist Jim Hall is given as much solo space as Farmer while Swallow gets ample solo time. LaRoca, a late addition to the band gets some solo space, but otherwise stays in the background providing colour, texture, and drive. It is clear that Farmer and Hall were musically in tune with each other and shared a common harmonic language as well as a shared appreciation for a beautiful melody.
~ Close your eyes and listen to this music. You quickly realize that the band has focused on the beauty of the melody and the harmonic structure of the eight tunes; tunes that vary from medium slow to medium fast. In the 1960's this may have been referred to as ""west coast jazz"" or even ""chamber jazz"" because of classical music tinge imposed on a swinging jazz foundation. It certainly is not ""hard bop"".
~ Watching the video is what makes this DVD special. Obviously the camera operators were either musicians or they were properly directed. The cinematography is artistic and excellent. As each member of the band solos, the camera zooms in on that artist. As a guitarist, I was pleased to see close-up shots of Jim Hall's hands during his flowing single note and chordal solos. Amazing fluid motion making it all look so easy. If you are a guitarist, this DVD is a tutorial in fluid fingering and chord structure.
~ The tunes on this 63 minute DVD are Sometime Ago, The Bilbao Song, Darn That Dream, Valse Hot, So In Love, I'm Getting Sentimental Over You, Petite Belle, and Bag's Groove.
~ As with all of the videos in this Jazz Icons series, the informative 19-page insert booklet is well worth reading. There is a discussion of the history of the band and each of its members as well as a detailed analysis of each tune,
~ The only reason to not give this DVD a five-star rating is the sound, which is not up to the standards of the other DVD's in this series. The flugelhorn sound is not as clear as it should be, and Jim Hall's guitar is bottom-heavy. However, do not let the less-than-perfect sound deter you from watching and enjoying this live performance.",1334448000,2,2290,4.628992628992629
