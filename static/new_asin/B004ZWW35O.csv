4510768,1,B004ZWW35O,"I was in Guanajuato, Mexico in March, 2008, when NPR filmed a pledge week special called ""Fiesta Mexicana,"" featuring Vickie Carr and the beautifull city of Guanajuato. Unfortunately, the Fiesta Mexicana I received was not that. I was so disappointed, because I had been trying to get the Vickie Carr film from NPR. Even though it was listed on NPR's WEB site, it was never made available.",1229385600,,389,4.82089552238806

I think it's safe to say that if you're a fan of the talented Mr. Rieu and his wonderful orchestra, you'll love this one too!",1421971200,,301,4.189655172413793

4510778,2,B004ZWW35O,"Disappointed with what the video contained,  too much fan talk and not enough music.  The reason I purchased  this
Video was to listen to Andre and his music not listen to chanting crowds of fans.  I listened  to his concert at Music Hall
New York  city and it was great,  that's what I expected.",1394582400,,296,4.37037037037037

4510780,2,B004ZWW35O,"Very disappointed, 50% music at the most , this was really talk and how good we are and  not a  musical show .
Waste of money for me,

However what I did see was audience that which in itself was the show,  joyful and full of fun. Left me feeling that I must still look for a DVD of the full show  .",1387756800,,299,3.6825396825396823

4510782,5,B004ZWW35O,"Anything Andre Rieu does is noteworthy!  This film captures his spirit, and Mexico's as well. I recommend it heartily. Viva!",1373587200,,124,5.2
4510783,2,B004ZWW35O,We have a LOT of Andre Rieu DVDs and this is hands-down the least favorite. It is disjointed and has far too much crowd stuff and not nearly enough music. It only has 16 songs. I like the older Andre Rieu DVDs where they focused on Andre and the orchestra. I love to watch Andre's expressions and the way he leads the orchestra. The newer productions focus more on the audience. I was very disappointed with this DVD and hope that future productions will get back to the music which is why we all love Andre Rieu!,1372464000,5,513,4.298969072164948
4510784,5,B004ZWW35O,"THE TWO DVD SET IS INFORMATIVE AS IT EXPLAINS RIEU'S HEALTH PROBLEM OF LAST YEAR.  IT ALSO GIVES DETAILS OF FILMING THIS MEXICANA VIDEO.  THE MEXICAN PUBLIC REALLY LOVES RIEU MUSIC AND OVERTLY SHOW THEIR RESPECT IN THE DVD.  YOU GET YOUR RIEU MONEYS WORTH CHOOSING THIS DVD.  FIESTA MEXICANA GIVES ONE A VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

I HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION OF RIEU DVDS AND CDS.  ENJOY THEM ALL.  I THINK THIS IS THE BEST SINCE HIS HOMECOMING DVD.",1372377600,,466,4.530120481927711
4510785,3,B004ZWW35O,"This DVD didn't include enough of the actual concerts.  It included  a lot of road tour information and interviews with Andr and his son and had a lot of coverage on concert preparation, staging, and Mexican fans.",1369267200,,213,4.72972972972973
4510786,5,B004ZWW35O,I would reccommend any Anre Rieu fan to buy this two DVD set and watch three hours of fantastic sights and sounds in the life of this orchestra in the homeland and in Mexic. It is brilliant.,1366416000,,190,4.162162162162162
4510787,3,B004ZWW35O,"Ceetainly not up to Andre Rieu standards. Not one of his better shows. To much talk, not enough music. He has done much better.",1364601600,,127,4.333333333333333
4510788,4,B004ZWW35O,"Too many interruptions for chit-chat.  One would expect such things to be options, away from the excellent concerts themselves.  I expected the really terrific concert out-takes, and those were not a disappointment.  I'll keep adding to my collections by this orchestra as long as they continue to generate them.",1361232000,,312,5.326530612244898
4510789,5,B004ZWW35O,"Here we have true entertainment.  This entertainment captures the audience almost immediately.  I have witnessed many audiences responding to Blue Danurbe.  Never have I seen so many respond as in Fiesta Mexicana - what a beautiful event to view and see for yourself.  The artists are the very best of the very best, the arrangements capture any listener with the best of tonal qualities, Andre is his own natural self bridging any gap between his orchestra, choir, and soloists, and leaves the audience wanting more and more and more and more.  This is truly a must see and must hear spectacular!  What a gift Andre Rieu, his orchestra, choir, soloists, and staff are in providing such magnificent lifegiving entertainment around the whole world.  They're the very best!",1359936000,,771,5.0236220472440944
4510790,4,B004ZWW35O,"Andr Rieu sabe como encantar e alegrar os participantes de seus shows. Os mexicanos ficaram maravilhados com a apresentao de sua orquestra. Ressalto a apresentao de Carmem Monarcha muito aplaudida, como sempre, em interpretao de The Earth, de Michael Jackson.

4510793,5,B004ZWW35O,His DVD's are much better than attending in person.  The music is always fantastic and the showmanship is always entertaining.,1353888000,,126,5.3
4510794,3,B004ZWW35O,reasonablly good to mutch american elongated african very noisey american singing this is fine if you like this type of presentation mever the less good in watching the reactions of the mexicans and their appreacions to andre for thaking his magnificant orchestra to play for them his orchestra is superb all the musicans are first class,1353196800,,337,5.035714285714286

4510796,3,B004ZWW35O,"2 DVDs Full with lot's of talking and not much music, there are lots of cut scenes, without any connection between them - it turns out everyone adores Andre and specially in mexico when is concert is like going to a football game. the all idea about the DVD was to show how much the Mexican people are warm and emotional people, and how they are so crazy about Andre and worship him - it a bit remind me of his south African ""documentary"" DVD, when he goes there to ""hill the world"".",1348963200,2,483,4.204301075268817
4510797,3,B004ZWW35O,"I was very disappointed in this Andre Rieu DVD,one of over twenty dvds of his that I own.  It wasn't the music played.  It was wonderful as only Andre does it.  It was the incessant verbage interrupting about every piece  played that was so annoying.  There are two dvds in this set,one devoted entirely to how the show was developed, the other for the show itself,but still with excess verbage,interviews,comments,etc.  I bought it on Amazon at a huge discount from the original asking price and am glad that I got it for that.",1348617600,19,528,4.623655913978495

Very happy customer. This DVD is a lot of fun to watch.",1343001600,,123,3.96
4510800,4,B004ZWW35O,"I believe this is one of the best shows Andre Rieu did for years and he was so smart to play songs related to the people there , I compare this show to the one he did in my city Montreal Canada while ago , no way to compare , in Montreal was a little fast food party and not at all to compare it with the effort he put there in Mexico , have no idea why , may be Montreal is not that hot as there in Mexico , who knows ??",1336003200,4,421,3.4893617021276597
4510801,5,B004ZWW35O,I always enjoy Andre Rieu and his orchestra's performances and this really is great.  I am so glad they included the Documentary giving us a little 'inside' view. The logistics of moving a whole orchestra and their instruments about the world are mind boggling!,1335139200,6,261,4.931818181818182
4510802,2,B004ZWW35O,"Too bad! Many words, very little music. We must create a DVD-only concert. Yet Rieu has held as many as 5 concerts in Mexico !",1334793600,,126,4.08
4510803,5,B004ZWW35O,Andre  and company  give us music that stays with us even when it is over. This dvd is the most joyous of all .  Andre is the musician for all ages.,1331769600,,148,3.7096774193548385
4510804,4,B004ZWW35O,"Disc 1 contains only 45 minutes of the concert given in Mexico City and 35 minutes of cutaways for interviews and crowd scenes. If you are looking for an Andre Rieu concert DVD, this isn't it. However, the 5 segments of behind the scenes footage on Disc 2  was well done and interesting, despite about 15 minutes duplicated from other Rieu DVD's. It was especially fun seeing Pierre operate his restored WWII Jeep and DUKW. If you are a hard core Andre Rieu fan, like me, then you'll like this two disc DVD set. If not, this product is best skipped.",1323561600,28,549,4.435643564356436
4510805,5,B004ZWW35O,"This DVD has given me many hours of enjoyment. It is suitable for people who love good music, fun and has interesting insights into this wonderful orchestra. A must see.",1320883200,,169,4.666666666666667
4510806,5,B004ZWW35O,This video was fantastic and so much fun. I have lots of Andre's videos and love them all. It is a great way to teach people about classical music. I get all my videos from Amazon as they are reliable and prices are good too.,1318896000,,225,4.022222222222222

8450502,4,B004ZWW35O,"Unlike Andre's other albums, this starts with a disc of episodes shown on European television covering his return to work from a serious illness and he and his organizations preparation for several concerts.  The second disc covers concerts they did in Mexico.  Rather than an uninterupted video of the concert, it is chopped up with backstage video of support operations and interviews of members of his orchestra.

When I first started watching this, I was disappointed that it was not pure music.  But, the more I watched, I found the backstage and interview portions really gave a very interesting look at what what it takes to produce these mega concerts.  It is well worth purchasing.",1479513600,3,690,4.965217391304348
