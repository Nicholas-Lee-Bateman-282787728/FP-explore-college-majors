5612562,5,B00BEZEFM4,"I have been following and watching the Booty wars unfold, but I decided to purchase the Booty Boot Camp video because I believe that Ms. Moore has designed a true Boot Camp type of workout that will provide me with quick and measured results.  In fact, it is my belief that this workout provides both a cardio fat burning blast, which will aid me in working my abs, as well as give me that beautiful lifted seat (I so covet).  Furthermore, I chose to purchase this video because I believe that Ms. Moore has put her heart and soul into producing a quality workout.

P.S. To all the haters, get real...this is a great workout!

Update As of 3/6/2013
I cannot believe how ridiculously immature my sisters are acting.  Kenya is not the only person who possesses solid written and verbal communication skills.  With that being said, know that I wrote my FIVE STAR critique, prior to the video being released, based on the workout preview I was privy to; and, I continue to stand by my assessment of its Five Star value.  Ms. Moore's workout video is excellent! Please people, gather yourselves and rest assured that this woman does not have time to write fake reviews........<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kenya-Moore-Booty-Boot-Camp/dp/B00BP4W5TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kenya Moore: Booty Boot Camp</a>",1361404800,27,1342,5.242990654205608

There are levels that you gradually move up to and I really felt it in my booty :)  The beginning level was totally doable the first time, and it had been a while since I last worked out.

5612584,3,B00BEZEFM4,"As a person who is use to doing hard core workouts I thought it was mediocre. If your going to get anything out of this workout you should probably do some actual cardio before hand. Also since the workout is a Kenya Moore workout I was really surprised that it was her trainer Nikki that did about 95% of the actual workout. The other 5% Kenya just changed the names to well known workout moves to ""Stallion"" in order to take digs at her RHOA co star Phaedra Parks. If you do an actual workout before hand I see no reason why this workout could not work. Lastly I expected a bit more of a count down when it came to reps, you had no idea how many reps you were doing and for how long during each workout, it was a bit confusing.",1454371200,,729,4.069444444444445
5612585,1,B00BEZEFM4,"I am not interested in her video. It's extremely difficult to support an aftican american woman who is so vindictive, an instigator, rude (she always speaks over people). She is not a beautiful person on the outside or inside.
 How a man of Matt's character could be interested in her passes all words of understanding. Good Luck! If the network had any sense, they would terminate her contract from Atlanta Housewives. She is an instigator, manipulator, and throws more shade then any other woman on the show.  I commend her for her accomplishments in life, howeve fo her age she needs to mature to learn how to humble herself and accept constructive criticism. She is not as beautiful as she thinks she is. Words of advice-Until you can admit your flaws and accept who you really are., your life will never be complete. Kenya ALWAYS PLAYS THE VICTIM.",1454198400,,852,4.75

I've only done level one and the abs/cool down portions (I was already warmed up from being on the treadmill for 45 minutes) and, although I didn't think those seemingly small moves were effective, I can definitely feel it today.  I can see this program being a part of my daily routine.  Thank you, Kenya, for putting out such a quality product!  You really should do more.  Maybe kick boxing or something of that nature.

5612662,5,B00BEZEFM4,"Classic moves that work. I have a booty obsession. I have done everything from Brazil Butt Lift to Buns Of Steel, and this work out is really good. It is organized with 3 levels, so you can grow with it if you are new to fitness or do all three but you won't beable to walk the next day. The moves are not huge, you are not jumping around, you are doing precise small concentrated moves like Lotte Berk or barre classes. I
like that I have all the classic booty moves in 3 separate work out on one DVD. I like to separate them for 3 separate workouts with the warm up and abs section during the week with an upper body workout in between. I average 300 calories with each work out, I wear a Polar HR monitor. I have reduced my lower body measurements about an inch in one month.  Everything just pulled in in a curvy way, and I like looking feminine.",1425340800,7,850,4.120481927710843

And i am completely happy with my purchase. I chose this one because i wanted a personal trainer to teach the moves so to speak after reading some reviews and blogs about Kenya's dvd vs other various booty enhancing dvds.
There are 3 different levels to exercise to, with an option of playing all, warmup, level 1, 2,3, abs + cool down, or cool down. I found Nikki Veal is very easy to follow and informative, She shows you what you do before you even begin to do the moves (which I have an issue with me being uncoordinated). Kenya teaches her signature moves and she is pretty easy to follow too.
The ab exercises alone are sure enough to make you have a flatter stomach in a month.

The other workouts are a bit boring and too low impact for me, not to mention keeping your Glutes contracted for 20 mins, and lying flat on your stomach, while imaging theres a quarter on your butt made me nauseous. I think this DVD got bad reviews because they don't like Kenya, and since I don't watch reality shows it makes it easier to look past who she is and just try do the workouts.

Oh, I don't blame you Kenya for going ahead and making this video. I thought Phaedra and Apollo were terrible not to offer you some type of commission for all your leg work, plus the fact that you are Miss USA Alumni and carries title and connections. I thought it was definitely rude, unacceptable and unbecoming for them to treat you disrespectfully and refer to you as nothing in Phaedra's office.  I commend you Kenya for acting respectably in the face of freee loaders who expect something for nothing. The two of them new you had name and credibility. Obviously what they expected was for you to give them a backing. Anyway, you didn't steal an idea.  You used the productions that were lined up for them.. When people choose not to, use it girl, and good you didn't put it to waste. Again, I'm so glad I have the video. No way would I ever purchase something with donkey booty.. no thank you..  Ladies you won't be disappointed.

Thank you so very much.

5612913,4,B00BEZEFM4,"I was hesitant to purchase this DVD just because of Kenya's attitude on the RHOA show. But then I thought that I shouldn't base my purchase upon that. The reason I decided to buy this is because I'm an African-American woman who is already Fabulous & in her 40s, and we don't have enough minority leaders in the exercise arena that are producing exercise videos that we can do in the comfort of our homes.  Also, Kenya's body does speak for itself so she obviously knows what to do to maintain a shapely body.  So I looked for a good deal where I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my money.  I purchased this DVD on Amazon.com a couple of weeks ago & began using it last week. To my surprise, I actually like it!  Kenya choose a great woman physical trainer to instruct the DVD and Kenya provides some of her signature moves as well.  If you don't like to do a lot of hyper-activity & jumping around throughout an entire DVD, this is a good steady-paced workout.  The exercises look like you may not being much, but trust me you will feel the burn.  I actually sweat when I do the warm-up and the exercises. There are also a sit-ups & stretch sessions included.  I'm impressed and am definitely beginning to feel & see the results in my butt, hamstrings, and waist area after 1 week (5 days), and will continue with the exercises.

5612932,1,B00BEZEFM4,"Since the height of the ""work out video"" revolution the format and standard was set. When VHS hit the American consumer in the 80's. The ability to pop in a tape and have a trainer in your private living room was genius! Then in the 90's DVD's offered Billy Blanks Taebo (I have hardly used and will put for sale here LOL)that was a hit to be able to jump/skip to a scene at random. Now the consumer in inundated or saturated with the ""Standard format"" of work out videos regardless of the title and trend. Well...sorry to say that this trend fell ""flat"" Pun intended, when Kenya did not offer a new angle or style to her video. If you ALREADY have exercise DVD's then you already have this one. Nothing new or genuine. While the studio setting is polished and impressive the idea is overdone and not inspiring. Save your money or if you are in the market for a effective and fun version of the gluteal work out genre then sincerely opt for the PHINE BODY series by Phaedra Parks and Apollo Nida. While it is obvious Phaedra has been blessed with natural curves she makes it fun to work your own body out for a chance to look as best as you can. Apollo is a natural when it comes to fitness and his confidence is motivating and encourages you to try harder and push for optimum results. Sorry Kenya but you've missed the mark.

I liked what I saw Kenya putting into her video.  It seemed like it was going to have more structure and was going to be an actual workout, see results type of video.  I was not disappointed.  I have only done the first part of the workout a few time but I already feel it is a good workout.  I am already in good shape and have always been active, so I figured if this keeps Kenya looking the way that she does, it will be good for me too!

I will report back once I try some of the other segments in the video.

Now let's review the video...

The warm up was great. It was pretty easy to follow. My sister and I liked that the instructor did the moves, then Kenya and the other girls followed. Unlike other videos I have it allowed you to get the move then participate versus trying to learn the move and participate at the same time. I like the video had three levels and am pleased I purchased it for my sister's birthday gift. Today's her birthday. Good job Ms. Kenya!",1366588800,6,693,4.203007518796992

I had the DVD for about a week and finally decided to pop it in and try it out. First of all I like how they have the video broken up into segments based on your fitness level, and the amount of time you have to work out. I started out with the 14 min warm up and level 1 20 min workout. I really felt the burn and was exhausted after the 34 min workout. I also had planned on doing the 12 min ab work out and cool down but was too tired. I was able to complete the ab workout before I got in bed. The one thing I didn't like was the music. They played the same instrumental track through the whole video. I also felt the video should have been a little more upbeat. However my main goal is to tone my lower body and abs and based on me actually doing the workout I am happy with my purchase.
