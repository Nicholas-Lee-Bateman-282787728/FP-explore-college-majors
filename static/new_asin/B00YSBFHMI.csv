I follow the directions and just get some message saying the code is invalid for UV redemption and to type it into the coupon box when making a purchase. But NCIS: New Orleans is not offered on Paramount's site.,1440115200,,279,4.490196078431373

7240073,4,B00YSBFHMI,"I have stated this before. I love all three NCIS series.  One must remember that each series is not going to be the same as the others in their story line or the way the characters interact with one another. In NCIS New Orleans, it has been fun to learn about the history of New Orleans as well as the stories for each week. The challenge is always there to try to solve the murder before the show does. It draws you in, keeps you there untill the end. Its just a wonderful series.",1438819200,7,481,4.117021276595745
7240074,4,B00YSBFHMI,"The tested and approved NCIS franchise makes the big move to the Big Easy with ""NCIS: New Orleans.""  Scott Bakula leads as NCIS Special Agent in charge Dwayne Cassius Pride, a former New Orleans sheriff's deputy with a long history in his home town, including a father in prison and a long-running feud with the Broussard crime family.  The rest of the regular cast includes Lucas Black as Special Agent Christopher LaSalle, JAG-alumni Zoe McLellan as Special Ageny Meredith Brody, and CCH Pounder as medical examiner Dr. Loretta Wade. Lab tech Sebastian Lund and computer forensics tech Patton Plame quickly became regulars over the course of this first season.

It turns out that NCIS has a lot to do in a busy port city like New Orleans, where the Navy does a lot of business.  Every week is a new crime to be solved, although there are some season-long plots to be resolved, especially with an organized crime family.  The team chemistry is good and gets better, and the show leans heavily on its unique New Orleans location shooting and story possibilities.  This first season also featured lots of cross-over visitors from NCIS, including NCIS Director Leon Vance, Very Special Agent Tony Dinozzo, and Coroner Dr. Ducky Mallard.  Coast Guard Special Agent Abigail Borin is a frequent and welcome visitor.  ATF undercover agent Sonja Percy figures prominently in the second half of the season.

The new show is a refreshing take on a familiar formula.  The episodes do a good job digging into the background and psyches of the main characters and their complicated lives.  It seems to work well, and has already been picked up for a second season.  Recommended to fans of the NCIS franchise.",1435968000,26,1696,4.871080139372823
7240075,5,B00YSBFHMI,"4.5 stars, looking forward to a 5 star season 2.

The show was introduced in the NCIS crossover episode ""Crescent City"", and 5 months later the NCIS: New Orleans pilot aired. The show is not as polished as the original NCIS (Yet), the actors are getting handles on their characters, and the writers are starting up their long haul stories. Season 1 is good, but I think season 2 will be better.

The team is led by Dwayne Cassius Pride, sometimes called ""King"". He is a friendly NCIS Agent who loves the city of New Orleans, his family, cooking, making music, and catching bad guys.

Christopher LaSalle is next in line, he has been on Prides team for a while, raised in Alabama he talks sweet to the ladies and talks strait with the guys.

Both Pride and LaSalle have strong southern chivalrous demeanors and very good reputations throughout New Orleans.

Team newcomer Meredith Brody rounds out our main team as a profiler and interrogator. She is intelligent and can handle herself both verbally and physically.

The support team is the Medical Examiner Dr. Loretta Wade, Forensic Analyst Sebastian Lund, and Computer Specialist Patton Plame.

There is also a supporting cast of family members, politicians, and other law enforcement personnel including special appearances by Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Abby, Director Leon Vance, even CGIS Agent Abigail Borin and FBI Agent Fornell.

The last of the big characters is the City of New Orleans itself. You catch true to life references when they make food, play music, and just walk around the city, like seeing funerary dirges and second lines. New Orleans stands out in so many scenes, great attention to detail.

Bring on season 2!",1435795200,17,1679,4.883802816901408
7240076,3,B00YSBFHMI,"I watched only some of the episodes and have a mixed reaction to the program.  The stories are good, but the cast is, well, so so. at least at
the moment.  All the other NCIS and CSI shows that I have watched I saw only after buying a number of seasons on DVD first.  I watched them
episode after episode and got the feel of the characters first, which is important to me if I am going to like the series.  So far, I loved all of them
except CSI Miami which I found a bit weak in cast.  I like romantic interludes on the shows between female and male partners such as Becket
and Castle, Bones and Booth and Ziva and Tony (after Kate).  Also New Orleans does not appeal to me, but perhaps if I finish all the other
unseen episodes that I have on my Amazon Video Library, I may change my tune.  NCIS (original) was excellent until Ziva left, leaving Tony without a charming competitive partner to bicker with and romanticize to.  Bishop is not a good replacement and besides I do not like bleached
blonds!  Still. Gibbs, Tony and Mcgoof are still there.  With this New Orleans show the cast at this time does not have the inter character relationships that I think is needed to be a success from my point of view.  But the stories are good  and I will keep watch and see how the seasons
develop.  Gibbs the actor is also of the producers and not surprising that  the boss has some of Gibbs characteristics.  That is good.  I only
gave it three stars but that is only pending for now until I view everything,  If you like good story telling,  you should like this.  Production is
top notch!  But I have not decided whether or not to get the  DVD but I probably will in the Fall.  Enjoy!",1435708800,3,1683,4.226415094339623

7240102,4,B00YSBFHMI,"**Update** in an earlier review below I thought I wasn't going to like this but this show is growing on me. As the relationships between the characters build and the storylines get more complex and they really start digging deeper into the mystery and darkness of New Orleans and all the cultures  and blends of different people, it has become quite compelling. This is what I was hoping for.  I'm about four discs in now and I'm really starting to like it. If you're on the fence about this purchase, give it a chance. Once you get about three to four discs in you'll see why it's gotten some high ratings. Pretty good show. Keeps getting better as I go.
 *Earlier review: *This has been okay so far and maybe since I'm only two discs in, I might fall in love with this a little more as it progresses - especially if I get to see the chemistry between the characters comtinue to develop a little more the way it did with LL Cool J/Chris O'Donnell and Daniela Ruah/Eric Christian Olsen in NCIS Los Angeles. With LL Cool J's and Chris O'Donnell's characters in particular, I didn't really feel that chemistry start to flow completely until near the end of the first season. Obviously, I'm still a major fan of NCIS Los Angeles. But by no means do I expect or want  NCIS New Orleans to be  a cookie cutter version of  the other shows in the NCIS family.  I was enthralled to see that it was set in New Orleans and I was expecting something really fresh and original and I'm not saying that it isn't.  I guess I just had a different expectation. With NCIS Los Angeles, the stories usually appeal to the mystery/sleuth fanatic in me plus the episodes are so action-packed and that is the icing on the cake. In NCIS New Orleans, so far I'm not seeing as much action as I'm used to  and  the mystery element is not as deep/ captivating as what I had hoped for. In NCIS Los Angeles  there are also compelling sub storylines  that keep you wanting to see what happens in the characters lives and a lot of the stories revolve around some terrorist mastermind and the agents are working to save either Los Angeles or the entire country in some cases from a terrorist threat before time is up. It's an edge of the seat type of show. Deep mystery  plus high drama plus High action equals a great show! I don't expect the storylines to be the same but I expected all those elements to be there  in spades.  That's what I have come to expect from the NCIS family of shows. With NCIS New Orleans so far I'm not on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next. I think the characters are overall pretty good, and the storylines are well-written but usually in every episode so far, the storyline revolves around a murdered sailor or NCIS official who is found at some high degree of decomposition or with severe damage to the body and of course you get to see the body being autopsied at the coroner's office fileted open and looking horrendous over and over. Not a bad thing, because I know they're going for a realism. I just don't want to see it in every episode and I don't want to see 10 minutes of dialogue being held over a badly decayed body that is split open. I care more about the action and the brilliant detective/ mystery solving work. Also, so far I haven't found the subplots as compelling as I wanted to. And maybe that's because they're just trying to show you how the relationships are building between the main characters right now. I do think that with this show being filmed in  New Orleans, they could do a whole lot more with that!  New Orleans has been to Hell and back and they have made some references to that (Katrina) but they haven't carried it out as far as I would like to see it carried out. Plus, New Orleans has a little bit of darkness about it that feels similar to places like Savannah Georgia. There's a little bit of  an undertone of the occult. There are lots of alternative lifestyles as well. It has this very ""World unto itself"" vibe about it. Plus there are the Creole and Cajun cultures and various other subcultures of voodoo and drag and sex industry. New Orleans is so diverse  because of all the melding of cultures. The characters feel like they're riding above all this. They don't feel part of it to me. They try to make the King character appear to be very much a part of it but something about him still feels a little out of place. And when they do introduce characters that are supposed to be regional or local people, they play quite menial roles or they are already dead and on the coroner's slab. For instance , a local prostitute with a fairly key role  was only on the screen maybe 5 minutes. A dead sailor that King had mentored  was only seen dead and on the slab.  They didn't do any backstory on him so that you could hear his dialect or see what he was like  when he was being mentored by King. I'm just not seeing as much diversity as I would like to see. Besides a couple of references to the great food and the music, I'm not seeing them take full advantage of being set in New Orleans. Like I said I'm only two discs in so that may change.. I read some of the other reviews about the character Chris LaSalle's southern accent. I don't find that bothersome because I am from the south and I like his accent. There's something about regional southern swag that a lot of people from other regions don't get. Sometimes people have difficulty appreciating southern swag. I find that most people  from other locales would readily accept and appreciate, for instance, a heavy New York or Boston accent and a lot of the regional colloquialisms  and ""ways of being"" that define people from those areas ,  but people seem far less accepting  of Southerners. They think that a person with a heavy southern accent sounds ignorant or stupid but it's really just regional dialect and has nothing to do with intelligence. Some people haven't embraced any concept of the new South yet so they see southerners with heavy accents  as ""cousin marrying"", hard living, and ignorant louts. Usually they are portrayed as racist if they're white and victims if they're black. And yes, there still is some of that, but it's not as prevalent as it is portrayed in the media.  Lucas Black really is from Alabama so a lot of what he is portraying is real. I don't know a whole lot about this actor  and I suspect that his own accent probably isn't quite this thick, but I'll bet he knows and has grown up around people who sound just like that. I sure have! I  personally like his southern, low-key brand of swag that he is bringing to the character of Christopher LaSalle. Loving CCH Pounder in her role. Also starting to see Scott Bakula In a different light. Never really thought about him much but he's pretty good in this.",1518307200,,6763,4.408032128514056

I was a bit concerned about the negative remarks about the southern accents (Alabama and New Orleans) until I read that Lucas Black was born and raised in Alabama so his accent is real.  Yes Scott Bakula's accent is not real but by the time I finished watching season 3 it seemed soft and natural to me.  Maybe it is because I have been a fan of his since ""Quantum Leap"" and think he can do any thing well.

Part of the reason I bought it was for the digital copy. I travel and work in varied locations, and digital copies are handy for me. I could only redeem the digital copy on the Paramount Movies web site. I dislike being stuck with the company web site. I dislike being forced to get email advertisements that I don't want.

Wish I could score this higher.  Just can't.  So far, we watched the first 4 episodes.  The first 2, from the spin-off and the second 2, I guess, from this series.  Unsure if I can watch many more if they do not improve. (for the record, I have all of the original NCIS disks and love each episode).  Now, relative to this one (NCIS, New Orleans), the acting and writing are horrid.  Everyone has on this phony smile.  It looks absurd.  CCH Pounder is doing an autopsy and is smiling.  The female agent cant wipe the smile off her face.  Just too much.  There ARE other emotions.  Last night, it sounded like someone must have held up a cue card for the actor to read and the actor just read it - no emotions at all.  Really hoping it gets better.

7240367,5,B00YSBFHMI,"When CBS announced that NCIS: New Orleans"" would become a part of its new line-up of shows in September 2014, I was very pleased. After all, another addition to the NCIS franchise could only be a GOOD thing

""NCIS: New Orleans"" is the third member of a highly successful franchise of police procedural crime dramas. (""NCIS"" and ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" are the other two.)  ""NCIS: New Orleans"" began as a two-episode ""backdoor pilot,"" entitled Crescent City Parts I and II,  during the eleventh season of NCIS.

Like its parent show, ""NCIS: New Orleans"" is inspired by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), an actual civilian-run law enforcement agency of the U.S. Navy. This show, however, is set in the NCIS New Orleans field office, and follows the investigations of Special Agents Dwayne Pride (Scott Bakula), Christopher LaSalle (Lucas Black), and Meredith Merri Brody (Zoe McLellan), as well as  Jefferson Parish Medical Examiner Loretta Wade (CCH Pounder),  and forensics expert Sebastian Lund (Rob Kerkovich). Two other recurring cast members  Darryl Chill Mitchell and Shalita Grant  joined the show later in the season.

From the very first episode of Season 1, its evident that NCIS: New Orleans is every bit as good as the show from which it was spun off.  It tackles the same kinds of cases  Navy-related crimes  committed in New Orleans and its surrounding communities. It tackles tough subjects like a bio-terrorism attacks, water boarding, prisoner escapes, political corruption, and assassinations. It combines humor, drama, and suspense in every episode. And it makes each and every central character interesting, likeable, flawed, heroic, and easy to empathize with.

Not surprisingly, I really enjoy watching NCIS: New Orleans Season 1. I honestly cant find  a bad episode anywhere amongst the 23 episodes of this shows inaugural season. I think this bodes very well indeed for the shows long-term success.

NCIS: New Orleans Season 1 earns my highest recommendation.",1467504000,6,1993,5.242902208201893

7240535,4,B00YSBFHMI,"The NCIS franchise is one of the most successful in television history primarily because it is character driven.
The simple fact is that fans - both those who are dedicated-never-miss-an-episode watchers and those who are only occasional viewers - find Gibbs and his crew easy to relate to because they work hard, are good at their jobs, and have qualities that most Americans find admirable.
In this latest spin-off of the franchise the writers and producers have again infused their scripts with strong characters but have elected to take a risk by giving the city itself a prominent role. That's risky because, while New Orleans is a vibrant city with many fine attributes, its reputation as one of the world's premier party towns isn't likely to sit well with many potential viewers who could well find its easy going morality difficult to relate to. As a result, the men and women who write and produce NCIS: New Orleans have charted a difficult course when it comes to attracting viewers from across what has become a very conservative country.
That said, I think the first season overcame that difficulty in general thanks to some strong performances by a fine ensemble cast led by veteran actors Scott Bakula and CCH Pounder. Frequent guest appearances by Gibbs and his team also helped to override some of the reticence that more conservative viewers might have to the locale. If I have one criticism of this first season it's that the writers tried, in my opinion, a little too hard when it came to ""selling"" New Orleans as a viable location for the series by having its lead characters constantly talking about it in loving terms. Hopefully in the second season that will be toned down some.
The show features the same strong writing and smooth narrative style that marks the franchise and it is well plotted. Technically, it meets the same high standards that are also NCIS trademarks. Taken all together, the series is off to a very good start and is well worth watching.",1445731200,,1984,4.821114369501466

This is the best DVD set I've purchased in a long time.  It comes with a digital copy, but I don't use that so I cannot give any insight to that part.  It includes the spin off episodes from the original NCIS, which I appreciated so I wouldn't have to buy that set.

7240563,4,B00YSBFHMI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It seems that CBS continues its decision to make all things alphabet with another series that takes place in the NCIS universe. Between CSI and NCIS there may come a time when every series on the network is alphabetically inclined. That might not be a bad thing as each of these series have found tons of fans and their own way to make themselves a part of the whole and yet separate at the same time. This holds true with this new one.

NCIS: NEW ORLEANS takes place in, well, New Orleans. But its not all about creole cooking and jazz clubs, though those do pop up on occasion here. Instead its about the NCIS offices there and their investigations into crimes involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corp. Going back to the formula used in the original series, weekly stories revolve around day to day crimes, mostly murder, as opposed to the LOS ANGELES series which focuses more on terrorist threats. Those do pop up from time to time here but aren't the centerpiece.

The group here is led by Dwayne Pride (Scott Bakula), a New Orleans native and ex-deputy sheriff who now runs the office. A longtime friend of Gibbs from the original NCIS series, we learn as this show progresses that hes in the midst of a divorce hes putting off as well as having a daughter starting college. We also learn that his father (Stacy Keach) is in jail and the pair have an unhealthy attitude towards one another.

Prides second in command is Christopher LaSalle (Lucas Black). Originally from Alabama he was also a deputy sheriff before coming the NCIS. LaSalle is the only character in the group that seems to have a very deep southern accent which is kind of refreshing and not condescending to southerners which it would have been if they all did. Problems arise for LaSalle involving his brother throughout the first season.

Next in line is Meredith Merri Brody (Zoe McLellan), a recent transfer from the great lakes office and the newbie of the group, even if this is only the first season. The interplay between Merri and LaSalle makes for some of the more humorous moments in the series and while they interact with one another nothing romantic seems at play here, another difference from other shows like this.

Rounding out the team are the forensics experts which include Dr. Loretta Wade (CCH Pounder) the medical examiner for Jefferson Parish, Sebastian Lund (Rob Kerkovich) her assistant and Patton Plame (Daryl Mitchell), a wheelchair bound computer whiz. Each and every one of the team members is given plenty of air time on the series and their contributions always help in the solving of each weekly crime.
The family quality that all of these shows presents among their characters is there but still developing as the show moves forward.

This first season does a lot to introduce the characters to one another but at the same time it introduces the biggest character of all to the viewer: New Orleans. This isn't the New Orleans that we all became acquainted with during Hurricane Katrina or the New Orleans that we witness with news stories about Mardi Gras. This is a city that is home to normal everyday people like you and me that are found in every city in the world. At the same time there is a certain flavor in the people of every city in the world as well and the flavor of this location makes up a big part of what this series offers. As I said, it becomes a character into itself here.

Various members of the other NCIS series make appearances here but for the most part the show focuses on the main cast. A commonality with the other series is that there is an underlying story that pops up throughout the season, this one involving a crime family with ties to Pride in the past, the Broussard family. It makes for some dramatic moments and puts the team members in the crosshairs off and on.

As an opening season this one holds up well to the other shows in the NCIS family. The cast is solid with every member contributing to the whole. Bakula as the central character the others form around does a great job here as hes always done in the past. With big shoes to fill in comparison to the lead characters and actors in the other NCIS show he holds up well and should take this show into a long run. Thats a good thing, just like this series is.",1443484800,4,4320,4.5424164524421595

The two lead males are Dumb and Dumber with their fake Southern accents.  In order to sound Southern, they slow down their delivery to the point that it sounds stupid.  It is an insult to true Southern accents and the intelligence and charm such speech patterns can evoke.  The writing is also terrible.  The morgue person is good, but no other main actors or supporting actors are even adequate.

The city of New Orleans was purposely developed as a ""character"" of the series and features many different locations within and surrounding the city.

7240640,4,B00YSBFHMI,"*I received a review copy of this in exchange for an honest review

I got on the NCIS train late, and I have therefore only been a fan for a couple of years now.  Im not sure why I waited so long to watch it; my wife has been telling me about how great it is for years.  But Im glad she convinced me to give it a shot.  Its an excellent drama with a nice tinge of humor.

After I had watched the primary show for a few months, I branched out and gave NCIS: LOS ANGELES a look.  It was ok, but not as good as the original.  Thus, when NCIS: NEW ORLEANS was announced, I didn't have high expectations.  But, because I had given LA a chance, I knew I should check this one out too.  Surprisingly, NCIS: NEW ORLEANS turned out to be a nice addition to the now-trio of Investigative Service shows.  And while its still not as good as the original, the show is a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out.

Actor Scott Bakula has been hit-or-miss with me over the years.  Hes done some really good stuff (such as the big screen adaptation of Clive Barkers LORD OF ILLUSIONS and the Star Trek prequel STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE), but then hes done some duds as well (I have to confess I didn't like QUANTUM LEAP at all).  Hes at top form in this role, however, and its nice to see him back on TV again.

NCIS: NEW ORLEANS looks good and appears to have a modest budget.  The production value looks high, and the show doesnt skimp on the details.  The set locations are nice as well, as the show is actually filmed in New Orleans; I love seeing familiar spots Ive visited personally in The Big Easy.

The acting is great, with the afore mentioned Bakula heading up a talented cast.  Lucas Black plays Bakulas right-hand-man, LaSalle.  Ive enjoyed Blacks work since I first saw him in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS over a decade ago.  And actress Zoe McLellan plays off of her male counterparts well as Brody.

The storylines in NCIS: NEW ORLEANS are well done and fleshed out.  Theres plenty of tension, and the proverbial crap hits the fan from time to time, forcing the group into drastic actions.  But, the day always manages to be saved, and the world moves on.

Which brings me to the slight negative aspect of the show:  its hard to switch gears from the formality Mark Harmons character, Gibbs, brings to the original NCIS, to Bakulas laid back, easy-going style.  In many instances, NCIS: NEW ORLEANS doesnt feel like a military-esque show, simply because it lacks the rigidity of discipline Gibbs instills in his team.  But this goes both ways; sure, its hard to adjust to the changebut its also a welcome one as well.  Sometimes Gibbs lack of flexibility gets downright annoying.

NCIS: NEW ORLEANS is a win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  The show has a lot of promise, and I suspect it will become more popular than its predecessor (NCIS: LOS ANGELES).  Fans of the original should enjoy it, while newcomers to the series will probably find it entertaining as well.  It is available now.",1440633600,,2990,4.399635036496351

7240644,4,B00YSBFHMI,"Many reviewers have covered the various aspects of the show and except for the fact that Dwayne Pride's New Orleans accent seems to wax and wane I can't add to much to what has already been said.

I have also had issues with the redemption of the UltraViolet copy that is supposed to be redeemable with this release. The instructions point to paramountmovies.com as the redemption site but their customer support says the title is not available from them. If the UltraViolet copy does ever become available from somewhere the instructions also state that it will only be available in standard definition.

EDIT 2015-08-23
ParamountMovies.com support has added this title to my ParamountMovies collection. I have no way to verify whether following the package insert's instructions now work or not. An issue still remains though as there are only 17 of the 23 episodes showing up at UltraViolet.

EDIT 2015-09-04
ParamountMovies.com support responded to my complaint about only getting 17 episodes by unlinking my ParamountMovies account from my UltraViolet account and suggesting that I relink them. This wiped out ALL of my ParamountMovies content and leaves me with my UltraViolet account with just the 17 episodes of NCIS: New Orleans that were placed there in the first place.",1440201600,,1280,5.144230769230769
