4512379,5,B00505QAUY,"I just watched this movie for the first time On Demand on my tv last night, and it was a very powerful, disturbing movie.  In fact this movie, along with Take Shelter, another independent movie are two of the best movies I've seen this year.

Tyrannosaur is a movie full of anger and redemption, and it did not disappoint.  The acting, screenwriting and directing of this movie, not to mention the soundtrack were all A+.  The story of a man so beaten down by his own anger at himself and the world, and an abused charity-shop worker mesh together in a way that left me thinking about this movie for hours.

I just had to come on amazon and give a review before purchasing this.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you, like me, appreciate stories of the human condition and the spirit of redemption, you must watch this. Another keeper.",1335052800,4,844,4.4480519480519485
4512380,4,B00505QAUY,"There is something about watching this very dark, brutal, intense, deeply sad, and yet profoundly compelling movie that seeps into the psyche, making future night walks rather fearsome. Paddy Considine who can bring us such warmly loveable characters on the screen as an actor here write and directs a story that pleads for us to look at just how low people can go - and still survive. It is shocking to watch but once the film begins the power of the story and the brilliance of the actors who bring it to life it is impossible to pause for breath.

Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a grizzled, isolated, drunk widower whose anger at the world is so close to the surface that he lashes out at the slightest provocation - even to the point of brutally killing his own beloved dog at the opening of the film - a fact that makes the audience loathe him form the start. He lives alone, occasionally visits his only friend who is dying from cancer, and ha a connection with a kid across form his flat, a young boy Sam (Sammuel Bottomley) who is forced to sit out on the sidewalk while his mother (Sian Breckin) cavorts with her current boyfriend (Paul Popplewell) who keeps his pitbull dog close by. In a matter of a few days Joseph has not only beaten his dog to death, but he has also crushed the windows of the Paskistani bank where he abuses the owners, and in a pub pool hall he severely beats three mouthy boys who taunt him.

Having no place to hide Joseph walks into a charity second hand store run by Hannah (Olivia Colman),a seemingly evangelical church woman who takes pity on Joseph and prays for him despite the fact that Joseph is atheistic. As the story unfolds we discover that Hannah is also a profoundly sad woman, her smarmy husband James (Edie Marsan) is abusive: Hannah is afraid of him and turns to drinking to escape her loathing of James. James spies Hannah with Joseph, threatens her, and rapes her, urinates on her, and destroys her organs with broken glass so that she is sterile.  Hannah attempts to leave James, gets drunk, is beaten more, and finally ends up with Joseph as her only friend and Gilead. When Hannah and Joseph seem equally at risk of violence, inflicted on self or by others, events become tense and suspenseful, and desperate though the characters are, we care about them and wonder what will happen between Hannah and Joseph when she leaves James for the drunken widower as the safer bet. Once the playing field is even between Joseph and Hannah things change and we realize how desperately at the bottom of the pit they are.  What happens form that point most be seen afresh to appreciate the ending.

There is some comic relief provided Joseph's drinking scraggly-haired drinking partner Tommy (Ned Dennehy) and some songs and dancing at the funeral when Joseph's friend dies, but the overall film is bleak and in the hands of lesser actors than Peter Mullen and Olivia Colman it may not  have worked.  But Considine's writing and direction along with the brilliant performances of these tow actors produces a film that is one of the finest of the year.  This is cinema at its darkest and we should see films like this to realign our own perspectives about how life can be severely difficult.  Grady Harp, April 12",1333756800,2,3251,4.591379310344828
4512381,4,B00505QAUY,"Another small, critically acclaimed film that flashed in and out of theaters quickly came to us from the UK, where audiences are more familiar with its first-time director and star. Tyrannosaur follows the story of Joseph, an unemployed alcoholic with crippling anger issues who decides to turn his life around after he accidentally kills his dog. As he develops a relationship with a local charity shop employee, he finds that her husband has violent tendencies of his own, and confrontation appears inevitable. Based on the same kind of environment Considine observed around him growing up in public housing, Tyrannosaur is brutal and unflinching, but I found the performances outstanding and the story of redemption rewarding. those of you looking for a bit of hard-hitting drama should see this.",1333497600,,799,5.25
4512382,5,B00505QAUY,"Very rarely does a film so bleak, so prone to trample over its characters until they might not come back up, manage to avoid the usual melodrama and clichs we have come to expect and instead stay an honest, unflinching and powerful glimpse of two individuals, one too hard and the other too soft for the world, just trying to make it through the day. Peter Mullan gives one of the year's most destructive and powerful performances as Joseph, a widower who spends his time drinking, picking fights and experiencing bouts of anger that tends to come crashing down into paralyzing moments of regret. We understand he wants better for himself and could use a bit of redemption but it isn't an easy thing to achieve. However, he does find some solace in Hannah played by Olivia Colman who also gives one of the year's most devastating performances as a thrift store owner and born again Christian. Joseph feels drawn to her glow and the sort of warmth he has been looking for. Sadly she isn't who she seems because behind her smile is immense pain for she lives with an abusive husband who beats her. Hannah had hoped religion could be her savior but when that didn't work she turned to alcohol. At times Hannah and Joseph can seem total opposites but yet exactly the same. As we watch their relationship develop there are brief moments of hope and even a few laughs, but for me even they are incredibly emotional and at times almost moved me to tears. Considine's exploration into violence and rage is so gut wrenching and brutally honest that when good things happen you are glad but also very cautious because moods could change without warning and this fine line they walk is hard to watch.

At the center of it all is Joseph's anger which comes from a place many films rarely explore unless the main character is a villain, and maybe under other circumstances or a different life he would be. But here he is just your ""Average Joe"" whose fury isn't brought on by some terrible event or the result of any wrong doing, it is just his nature. He was born with a fire inside. It caused him to be mean and abusive to his wife, it causes him to rough up kids at a pub, and throw a rock through the front window of a shop. The best Joseph can do is try to control this rage and when it gets the best of him, like in the film's opening when in a fit he kicks his dog's ribs in, he shows what little kindness he can by carrying it home, being by its side as it dies and then burying it in the back yard. In any other film is would be impossible to expect the audience to forgive such an act, but Considine understands that. You see he isn't asking for forgiveness but just hoping to reach an understanding with the viewer. As terrible as Joseph's actions may be at the time the idea that it is his nature, something he can't control which is destroying him, and the fact that he tries his best to do good evens out the scales just enough for us to have faith in him.

 The most important of these attempts to adjust comes with helping Hannah who he tries to protect even though everything about him says otherwise. This leads to the film's most shocking moment in which he discovers a truth about her, and perhaps about himself and every human, that rattles him to the core. This truth being that even the most glowing and kind of people are capable of unthinkable violence and rage. Now this might seem to be a totally bleak assessment on life, and maybe it is, but Considine doesn't allow it to prevail without putting up a fight. Instead he tries to make us and Joseph realize that the best you can do is battle through it all and although you will not always find redemption at least maybe a bit of peace and happiness can be earned, which might mean sacrificing yourself.

I really have to hand it to Paddy Considine who most know from his acting in such films as ""Deadman's Shoes"" or ""In America"". For this to be his first feature is quite impressive. He shows a level of maturity and confidence you would only expect from a veteran director. This could have easily become a preachy or overly stylized independent film that drowned in its own melodramatic miserablism but instead Considine wasn't afraid to be dark, gritty and realistic and stay true to his characters, caring for them and their emotions in a way that didn't feel artificial, and making a real connection with the audience. To say it is an easy watch would be a lie but its profoundness in its exploration of violence and anger along with two of the year's best performances make it a must watch and one of my favorite films of the year.",1328313600,24,4601,4.422169811320755
4512383,2,B00505QAUY,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The late screen writing guru, Blake Snyder, came out with a book a few years ago, entitled 'Save the Cat'. He argued that a successful screenplay should contain a 'Save the Cat' moment at the beginning of a script, where the hero ingratiates his audience through a humanitarian gesture (it could involve helping a person or even an animal; hence the term, 'save the cat'). Newcomer writer/director Paddy Considine turns Snyder's advice on its head by offering up the opposite: a 'Kill the Dog' moment. Rather than feeling sympathy for the protagonist, Considine seeks to alienate the audience from his protagonist and is quite successful--I can't recall a film in recent memory where not only one, but two dogs are actually killed by the film's protagonist.

My pet peeve with 'independent' films these days, is that many protagonists don't like themselves. I call them 'sad sacks'. They're the type of characters that don't make for good drama, since their egos are weak, are always down on themselves, and have little or no charm. Considine's 'Tyrannosaur' goes a step further by offering up Joseph, the unemployed North England widower, who has a perpetual anger management problem. When he meets domestic violence victim, Hannah, who runs a charity shop, his harsh words toward her, are a very hard draught to take.

Nonetheless, there is an even more despicable character than Joseph and that's Hannah's husband, James, the ultimate abusive husband. James' character is designed to shock as he's seen returning home one night, intoxicated, and ends up urinating over Hannah while she sleeps. He later rapes her and she reveals that he's placed shards of glass in her private parts in the past, causing her to become infertile. While the domestic violence scenes are admittedly powerful, they are also wholly manipulative, since James is merely a one-dimensional monster. It would have been much more difficult for Considine to humanize his villain. This also holds true for his secondary characters, the skinheads who live across from Joseph, who are also perpetually angry, and are not above goading a dog to attack a child.

Considine attempts to humanize Joseph a bit as he ultimately softens up in his relation to Hannah. But in a cruel twist of fate-SPOILERS AHEAD-Hannah is jailed for murdering her abusive husband. While Joseph pays his respects at a funeral for a friend and visits Hannah in prison at film's end, this seems to indicate that he's 'cleaned up his act' somewhat; but is it enough to forgive him for past transgressions? Some would say, given his background, 'yes'. But to my mind, the horrible killing of the two dogs, is enough to reject Joseph out of hand. There are many people who had horrendous childhoods or difficult lives, who don't end up killing defenseless animals and subjecting others to continuous, psychotic outbursts. Considine seems to argue that characters like Joseph, should be given a 'free pass'; or perhaps people should be 'understanding', given the environment these characters come from.

There are occasional strong moments in 'Tyrannosaur', especially the aforementioned domestic violence scenes. But there were some characters who were too one-dimensional (such as James) and others like Joseph, who I was inclined to have little sympathy for. Only Olivia Colman's performance as the brutalized Hannah, proved to be compelling and saved the film from a total unpleasant aftertaste. With so many films on the market, investing oneself in Joseph's journey, is not one I would care to take again.",1326931200,8,3592,5.112436115843271
4512384,3,B00505QAUY,"TYRANNOSAUR offers a bleak picture of life in contemporary Britain.  Joseph (Peter Mullan) is unemployed, with a tendency towards violence, who has contributed in no small part to his wife's early death (the Tyrannosaur of the title refers to his widow).  He encounters Hannah (Olivia Colman), a middle-class woman working in a local charity shop, who offers to redeem him through prayer; initially he rejects the offer, but as the film unfolds he gradually becomes more and more involved with her.  Hannah has as bleak a life as Joseph, having to cope with a violent husband (Eddie Marsan), who eventually rapes her.  She stays at Joseph's house, and the two of them form a relationship, even though neither of them can disclose their feelings.  Deliberately shot in washed-out colors, TYRANNOSAUR suggests that people are imprisoned by their existences, whether they are working- or middle-class.  The only hope of 'redemption' - which is perhaps too optimistic a word - is to trust in one another, and even then, the redemption might be only temporary or partial.  This is what Joseph and Hannah discover at the end, even if their meetings are only sporadic.  Paddy Considine's film is not for the fainthearted; the language is extreme, and there are violent scenes throughout.  It is well written, even though there are one or two implausibilities; at one point Joseph kills a neighbor's dog, who has previously mauled the child Sam (Samuel Bottomley).  Normally any dog would have been put down by the authorities after such an incident has occurred.  Nonetheless this low-budget film has a powerful effect.",1390089600,,1612,5.068181818181818

If you want a movie with great acting and that does not follow the typical Hollywood formula, this is for you - just be sure you don't need to be happy for a little while after it.

I found the way they tied the name of the movie into the story to be my favorite part.  You have to get past the 1st scene where he kills his dog in a drunken rage.  It is brutal, and I literally snuggled my dog for a good 10 minutes seeing that (think Clockwork Orange opener).

4512426,4,B00505QAUY,"I'm having a hard time wrapping myself around this film. It's exqusitely filmed, scripted, and acted, and the director does a marvelous job of painting unsympathetic people sympathetically. That in itself is a kind of artistic marvel.... But I was profoundly troubled by a few scenes in the movie, which were far more intense given the nature of the characters involved. I would have given this film 5 stars were it not for those scenes; they left me a bit scorched, I would say.  That being said, however, I do not think anything in this movie was extraneous; i.e. the director and scriptwriter have made use of each scene and each event in the lives of these characters in a masterful way to draw the viewer further into this dark world and make it partake of what one author once referred to as possessing the inner consistency of reality. That they make bad choices and live to suffer the consequences of those choices only reflects the truth about a broken humanity that is powerless to save itself: the human person must look to another for the way forward into integrity and the fulness of life.

I am particularly fascinated by the way prayer was handled in the movie--a typically improvised prayer (offered in somewhat rote fashion, as such prayers often are) spoken over a man in flight from his own broken self is received as a pronouncement of ultimate hope and light that reveals to him in stark terms just how far away from all that he truly is. That such a religious moment is not resolved in a superficial conversion that makes Life All Better speaks volumes about the depth and insight that is offered here.

Yes, the movie starts out with the central, widowed character kicking his dog, carrying it home, and watching it die, as the animal stares reproachfully at his drunken master. And yes, a woman is pissed on, as she feigns sleep on the family sofa. Letting us know from the outset what her life is like at the hands of her abusive husband (not the same guy). The scenes are brutal, yet altogether honest. Bleak to be sure, yet somehow it all works out in the end. Not in some nice, tidy Hollywood manifestation, mind you. But certainly in how the real world works. Sure, the main character is hard to watch at times, as he rages against the world, but if you stick it out until the end you'll be rewarded for the effort. He does indeed feel remorse for his terrible deed, and tries to mend his ways, but in the end the story comes full circle. Can't tell you more without ruining the startling ending.

4512444,4,B00505QAUY,"This is a movie that should be talked about much more...it's Oscar worthy in many ways, writing, direction, and the acting is off the charts (I forget names).

4512449,4,B00505QAUY,A interesting exploration of the evil in humans and living with that fact.  Well Acted. Simple yet deep and it is always nice to see a movie with substance and reality.,1368748800,,168,4.419354838709677
4512450,4,B00505QAUY,wow - this was very intimate and it opened some old wounds - the acting was superb - very graphic - but i was glad to see that she was strong enough to pay back the bad treatment,1368576000,,178,3.710526315789474
4512451,5,B00505QAUY,This movie portrays hope in life when hope is lost. It portrays God in a godless world. I loved it!,1368576000,,99,4.0
4512452,4,B00505QAUY,"Wow - this was unexpected. Guess I should have read the reviews people wrote before watching...probably wouldn't have watched it.  (** two dogs are killed, a woman is abused and raped and there is other violence/abuse **)  As it was, I almost turned it off to watch something else but then realized I'd watched enough to be sucked in and wanted to see how it turned out because these two are supposed to see each other as their salvation, so I kept thinking it would get better...

This is a gritty story of a very unlikable SOB drunken man with issues... one day he is drunk and mostly running from himself and ducks into some little (boutique?) run by a nice woman. She is scared but reaches out to him by praying out loud for him. Somehow they strike up a bit of a relationship. Then you find out that her (upper middle-class?) life isn't so peachy -- she is living a nightmare herself.

One thing leads to another and though things are very ""messy"", they perhaps find in each other just what they need and it actually has kind of a surprise and then maybe a hopeful ending. If I didn't see it through to the very end, I would not have rated it this high - more likely I would have given it 2 stars. But to be honest, it was a bit hard to watch.

I don't know anyone personally I'd recommend this to, it's a bit hard to watch. But read some other reviews and decide if you want to see this.",1368403200,,1393,4.2218045112781954

4512464,5,B00505QAUY,"This is the first movie I've seen that honestly depicts real life. We all can be beautiful, saintly even, but we can also be so dark, evil, lost. This movie gets it. I guess I seem to relate due to circumstances in my own life, nothing as extreme as the movie but very real none the less.

The two main characters have really nailed their parts. They should have won an Academy Award.

4512465,1,B00505QAUY,"Simply hated this movie.
The ""F"" bomb was used over 200 times, my guess.
I had to watch the remainder just to see if there was anything good about the movie, There was not.
The movie starts with the main character killing a dog and the movie ends the same way.

4512468,5,B00505QAUY,"Peter Mullen can pull off true anger in a movie with more realism then anyone else ever on film.
Ever see Session 9? His roles seem real and very gritty and he brings disturbing life to them.

that makes you think, life just isn't fair.",1365033600,,328,4.222222222222222
4512469,5,B00505QAUY,"I admit I had to summon up the courage to watch this; I'd had it to review for some time, knew what to expect and wanted to able to engage with it fully.
It is an unflinching, uncompromising piece of film-making; pitch-black in tone, it's angry, violent and deeply disturbing - but also quite moving. What is most uncomfortable about a film like this is that we all know that for some, aspects of what we are watching is someone's reality. As a study of urban alienation it is all too believable. Joseph is a complex, car-crash of a man, brilliantly characterised by Peter Mullan who slowly develops a relationship with the abused charity shop worker Hannah, played with subtle vulnerability by Olivia Coleman; they are ably supported by an excellent cast and Considine`s writing and direction never misses a beat - this is an amazing debut with that fact in mind.
This is a raw, difficult thing to watch - I can`t imagine anyone viewing it for pleasure or entertainment - but it is a haunting, memorable and thought provoking work. A social drama that seems to have no clear message, but leaves the viewer with a window into facets of humanity we perhaps rarely have to consider; both characters have to struggle with almost unendurable circumstances; there is a kind of resolution attained, but not without consequences.
A highly recommendable film, but be prepared for it's very dark issues.",1362355200,,1394,4.788381742738589

4512471,4,B00505QAUY,"I saw this film last night and have to say that the scene where joseph kills the pitbull whi savages the young boy was a sad indictment of the nature of our society embodied by the thuggish boyfriend who's almost in tears when the deed is done and yet didn't get the dog sent to a resuce home after it savaged the child after he and hsi friend constantly teased it and eventually it snapped.
All in all, the story of joseph and hannah was good in showing that his assumptions of her life in the beginning were unfounded snd clouded by his own bitterness another thing that I think afflicts many poorer areas in the Uk.",1360195200,,618,4.2905982905982905
4512472,4,B00505QAUY,"Some people (possibly too many of us) do wake up on a daily basis to extremely tormented lives. I appreciate the film's unapologetic realism that life, despite good intentions and best efforts, is simply life. Human beings are strong and frail and perverse. We're naturally offensive, and will break the rules designed to keep us morally and socially controlled. We snap and break under the pressure of our own demons and the insanity of those around us. We love and we hurt even when we claim indifference. We devolve and we evolve, swimming rebelliously and furiously against the strength of life's undercurrents. We go through cycles of progression and regression, climbing and falling over and over again. In our most secretive places, we're simply human. This film is not about animal cruelty, alcoholism, domestic violence, race wars, class wars, or living in a past that is lost in the present. This film is about how we are bound one to the other in the strangeness of oddly-shaped pieces that fit together to tell one of an infinite number of stories that weave and interlock in the puzzle of life.",1358640000,6,1107,4.862433862433862

4512485,5,B00505QAUY,"I've been a fan of Paddy Considine ever since I saw him in director Shane Meadow's amazing first film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Room-for-Romeo-Brass/dp/B000056IFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Room for Romeo Brass</a>, in which he played a creepy, insecure bully with considerable skill. He went on to star in more of Meadow's films, notably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Man-s-Shoes/dp/B001BLFMVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Man's Shoes</a>, in each showing himself to be an actor of great ability. With this film, Considine proves that he isn't just a one trick pony: he can direct as well as act. As far as I understand it, he wanted to make this film for some time, but had great trouble raising the necessary funds. It's a credit to him that he managed it, and then made such an accomplished piece of work. Few films nowadays dwell within scenes, or on actors' faces, thereby deepening the viewer's experience. They're far too busy whipping on to the next scene. This is not Considine's way.

The film is mainly the story of two people, an angry, ill-mouthed alcoholic, and a long-suffering religious woman who is fearfully abused by her husband. An uncompromising story arc follows. What I found most powerful was the way that Considine allowed the camera to linger on the actors' faces, expressions and acts, refraining from using music to fill the air, as it were. Consequently, the towering performances are augmented, the suffering magnified, the horror driven home even further.

This is a work of great skill, with a fine set of actors. It's so well shot, full of atmosphere, and all the more terrible for that. Thankfully, it's not 100% bleak. That would have been hard to take. Absolutely outstanding. I look forward to Considine's next film with great anticipation. 5 solid gold stars out of 5.

4512486,5,B00505QAUY,"This movie is extraordinary from start to finish.  I recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a realistic, exemplary story of good and evil. Paddy Considine has made a truly unforgettable and deeply moving film.",1352419200,,219,4.918918918918919
4512487,4,B00505QAUY,"Because of my work schedule, I sometimes have to watch a movie in two installments. I intended that to be the case here, but, I simply could not turn it off.

Here's the scoop. Joseph is an angry drunk on public aid. After a particularly bad bout with the bottle he finds himself hiding out in a used goods shop run by a very religious woman. She offers to pray for him. He'll have nothing to do with it, but after some while the two begin to trust one another and a relationship evolves.

When I saw the description of this I thought I knew what was going to happen and didn't think I'd enjoy it. But it was directed by Paddy Considine who is a veteran actor so I thought I'd give it a go. I couldn't have been more wrong on the content. This is not like ""The African Queen"" where a good woman shows a wayward man the right path. This gal, Hannah, is in a horrible circumstance herself and is on her way to chucking religion down the sewer. She might be the one who needs a new path. These feel like real people in real life. It's not neat and things aren't wrapped up pretty in the end. But both people are on their way to making peace with themselves and each other when it's over.

This is Considine's first feature film as director and he shows a deft hand. I never thought the camera was in the wrong spot and he coaxes great performances from the two leads. The music and all other production values were on par with the content. The one problem I had was that the British accents were so thick at times I simply could not catch all the dialogue. As a result I'm not entirely certain what point was being made. That those who are religious and those who are not have to find some way to meet in the middle? That's about the best I can come up with. But this is about as good a drama as I've ever seen and there are a couple of surprises that will give you pause. This is a definite watch if you're into this sort of thing.",1347408000,,1929,4.111405835543766

This dark drama, is horrifying, sentimental, wonderful and I could go on and on.. A true test of ones emotional extremes..  Short side is I really liked it.. The acting is superb, it is 100 % believable and has NOTHING to do with pre-historic creatures, but centers on good old  EMOTION. The strong dialect, is challenging at times to understand, but to me added such a fine quality to the production.. I never watch a movie twice, but  the button at h u l u  said  replay, and I hit it.. The second time around I understood the words alot better..",1339718400,11,656,4.4789915966386555

4512491,4,B00505QAUY,"Let me just say this film took me totally by surprise because it hails from good old England. A land I have always regarded as courteous a place where the Government pays for refugees, a place where a lot of people from Africa find a convenient refuge. The Government is most pious and the tax payer's money is put to rather generous use. Now again this is just something I have grown up knowing because the English are a rare commodity in their own land. They have somehow been tight lipped about the whole thing too. As a common man who's been there a few times I just feel the English take too much from the world. Do correct me if I'm wrong, intact throw stones at me in the comments column. This is also possibly why films like THIS IS ENGLAND and TYRANNOSAUR right here hit you so hard in the face. While the subject matter is mostly not akin to what i have written so far about England, I found this film to be particularly driven, angry, violent, relevant because come on England, isn't the levy supposed to break?

**SEMI STORY SPOIL BUT READ IF YOU'RE DARING**
Ty is a film based on a lonely woman who runs some sort of an everyday clothe shop and a middle aged bald angry drunk man who runs away from hooligans chasing him. He is being chased and he seeks temporary refuge in her shop. He enters the store and simply hides behind a line of clothes while she calls him out very politely. This is how they both meet and the story follows suit. NOW I MUST COMMEND the director for he made such an empirical film about very subtle downplayed lonely people who actually have a sea of anger inside them.

This film was a joy to watch because despite it's strong slaps of violence, it is very human and relatable. I will not like to compare Tyrannosaur with any films that you have seen except maybe THIS IS ENGLAND because it is such a memorable film, an instantly memorable classic for me that comes once in a way.

I loved it and it killed all my expectations. I hope I have done my job and at least made you want to watch it despite how incoherent my banter can ""READ"" to some. good luck.",1336608000,2,2096,4.287878787878788

8450760,5,B00505QAUY,"TYRANNOSAUR is no easy film to take in. It is a window into a very harsh, unforgiving environment populated with people that have a lot of personal pain. It is also brutally honest in its assessment of the world as a violent place that pushes us to our limits. Still, it isn't all depressing because of chance encounters in which we meet people who seem to be very different from us on the surface, masking pain that is very similar to our own. This is the type of story that TYRANNOSAUR tells, and all from first-time feature director Paddy Considine. He gets strikingly real performances out of his actors and shows a firm directorial hand. There is hardly anything to gripe about here, save a couple of moments of animal cruelty which could turn off a lot of people. I must admit that I was somewhat revolted in those scenes, but they still felt organic to the story. One major theme explored is what people do when pushed to their limits, and there are many instances throughout the film in which this is shown. I don't really want to spoil anything specific, so if a dark psychological drama is something you're into then this will probably be one of the best you'll see.",1431216000,2,1176,4.525821596244131
