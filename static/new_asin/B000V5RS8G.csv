And a particular highlight is Jack Lenoir (who portrays the butler/confidant/tour guide to Wayne Rogers) who's performance is fantastic. Another first-rate effort (that really needs to be available on DVD) from writer/director Frank D. Gilroy.",1444176000,,418,5.348484848484849

Cast and story keep you interested.",1387843200,2,126,4.291666666666667
8216563,3,B000V5RS8G,"The tape was locked up and the spools would not rotate.  I took it apart and found a broken pall release lever.  I was able to put the spools in another cassette and it worked fine.  I like the tape, but it was a hassle to get it working.  The seller read my original feedback and offered a refund or replacement, but I had it working so I passed.  Not worth the effort to replace at this point.",1381795200,,395,4.012820512820513
