8241368,5,B0011BK2L4,"I love this film and the way it explores the dilemma of a middle class Cuban family as the Batista regime gives way to the Castro revolution. The viewpoint is that of a pre-adolescent youngster who is confused by the changes he sees within himself and in society around him. I still find most touching his first little romance with the leukemia-stricken neighbor girl, whose impending death symbolizes the death of Cuban culture. As a final request, the girl wants the boy's grandmother, a photographic artist, to paint the burial dress in her funeral picture pink like a quinceanera gown. Because of her illness, she never will have her quinceanera, a Latin tradition something like a Sweet 16 party that is held in a girl's 15th year, but the picture will imply that she did. As the plot progresses, the boy's family must decide whether to adjust to a changing society or escape from it and start anew elsewhere.",1340496000,,914,4.754716981132075
