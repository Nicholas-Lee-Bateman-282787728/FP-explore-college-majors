3735990,5,B001OQQKOO,"I never really liked riding on a trainer, but after I learned what these virtual cycling DVDs were all about, I pulled mine out this winter.  The first person view of the road made the difference for me, and the fact that it has so many different coaches makes it like I have a bunch of different ""riding partners"" to train with.  After my first couple of rides so far, I'm now looking forward to riding all 12 different coaching tracks - that should go a long way to helping me be ready to hit the ground running this Spring.",1234742400,2,526,4.25
3735991,5,B001OQQKOO,Just when you think riding indoors on a bike going no where is boring - you can get motivated with these fun real life rides. You feel like you are really there. The music is great and the work out is the best part! It can challenge you because you are on a real course! Great for those days when riding outside is a challenge.,1233273600,3,327,4.046153846153846
3735992,5,B001OQQKOO,Well almost:) The cinematography on this video is amazing. The scenery was incredible. There was a couple of time where I almost forgot that I was in snowy Pennsylvania. The videos are shot from the first person perspective and you really get the sense that you are riding a bike thru Hawaii. SO VERY COOL! This video makes wintertime training more than bearable and darn near enjoyable. The music is good and the coaching really keeps you motivated. Get these and hit the roads in Spring with summertime legs!,1231977600,11,510,4.741573033707865

A great addition to your Spinning Class!

3735994,5,B001OQQKOO,"I had never really been much of a fan of exercise.  Once I decided to start doing something, I decided on cardio as the way to go, and indoor cycling as the means.  It was pretty boring and tedious until I bought these DVDs.  Cool coaching tracks give you several different versions of each ride, good music, good bonus pilates/yoga (I didn't expect these to be as challenging and refreshing as they were).  Overall a solid product and a great choice for anyone wanting to add some enjoyment to their indoor cycling workout.",1231804800,4,524,4.602150537634409
3735995,3,B001OQQKOO,"I purchased this because one of the workouts is on the same road I run when on Maui.  This isn't the drop-dead beauty you will see in a travel video, but rather looking at the road with scenery in the periphery.

I felt it would be a good recovery workout, which it is, as you can pedal at a reasonable pace while looking at nice scenery.  However, it's hard to follow the instructions from the coaches if you wanted a particular kind of workout (hills or sprints for example).  I prefer videos that display the gear or resistance that you should be riding and the cadence you should be spinning.  It's hard to know that you are in the proper settings and pushing the designed effort (the Australian coach seems to give the best clues).  You can tell when the course is going up or down hill, so you are on your own to adjust your workout to match the terrain and track your effort to the kind of workout you desire.  I use this when I just want to get on the bike and spin.

If you are looking for nice scenery on a recovery workout and you are experienced with indoor training, you will probably find this set useful.  If you like to be guided through a high intensity workout, this isn't the right set.

I've not done the palates effort, but it seems to be led well.",1327190400,3,1269,4.25
3735996,1,B001OQQKOO,"If you want to watch Hawaiian scenery while on your trainer, buy a travel video.  This vid was not very motivating for a cycling work out. The POV did little to make me feel I was really cycling on Hawaiian streets, as there were no other cyclists up ahead to give you a group ride feel.  Occasionally, there would be cut away shots to a lone cyclist riding behind the camera car, as in watching a cyclist behind you if you were traveling in the back seat of someones car and looking back. It did nothing to make me feel I was on a virtual bike ride.  The ""coaching"" voice over wasn't worth listening to either. Listening to someone tell me we were going up a steeper grade, or coming down a decent, etc. added nothing to help me very cadence or power output during the workout, as you really couldn't tell if you were on a climb or decent from just looking at the video. Finally, the music was very low energy for a workout.  I would have rather listened to this music if I was lying in bed with a case of insomnia. save your money, and buy Spinervals or something geared to giving you a real cycling workout.",1326067200,,1110,4.246445497630332
3735997,3,B001OQQKOO,"This series is a good workout.  The coach's voices are not easy to hear and the scenery is not as pretty as I had expected, not a high quality video production.",1301788800,,160,4.161290322580645
3735998,3,B001OQQKOO,"I have been enjoying spin classes for years and was looking for a dvd to use at home when I cant get to the gym. I was disappointed in the audio quality of the dvd . If you enjoy listening to the music while working out you sacrifice the ability to hear the coaching. It sounds like mumbling in the background and is very annoying. The visual is confusing, its hard to tell the difference between a climb and a decent so working without the coaching is also difficult. The scenery is beautiful and the music is good. Still if you are looking for a spin class experience, this dvd falls short in the coaching area.",1297814400,,613,4.293103448275862
3735999,5,B001OQQKOO,"Great product! Needed to get motivated and back in shape, and watching a bunch of people spinning on trainers with someone cheerleading them on is not my thing. Just tried my first last night, Oceanside Ride, and it was over before I knew it. No kidding...it seems like riding outside. Can't wait to try other coaching tracks and watch other discs in the Hawaii set. A great way to stay involved and interested...the sense of movement makes the time fly by. I am so glad I stumbled across these before I wasted money on something else.

Thanks to the people at GlobalRide and CyclingFusion for such a really unique and valuable tool. Some may complain about video quality, water on the lens, or camera bounce, but they're missing the point...that's part of the experience if you were really riding outside. Thanks for a great motivational product! I'd recommend these to anyone looking for something to make indoor training more engaging...actually something you may start looking forward to.

3736000,5,B001OQQKOO,"I already own their Italy 3-pak, and I recommend the Hawaii series.  The DVDs in the set while in the 45 to 44 minute length are good for both speed spinning and simulated hill work.  I use the 45 minute DVDs as a high cadence warm-up for weight training.  The longer DVD, Stredurance is good for both a 50 plus minute paceline tempo workout coupled with 20 or so minutes of hill work.  The scenery is beautiful and varied enough to keep the mind engaged.  I have found the company, Global Ride, to be tremendously responsive and honest with me.  I have been very satisfied with all of the products I have purchased.  I do find their videos to be among the best I have viewed for indoor training and wish they had more:  I own approximately 18 virtual cycling DVD's from 4 separate vendors.  I recommend the Hawaii series set very highly.  I rate this set at 5 star level.",1268524800,,872,4.3602484472049685
3736001,5,B001OQQKOO,"I'll confess up front that I'm not an expert cyclist. I have a balance problem and tend to run into rock walls. Cycling outside is just not happening for me.

These are wonderful! Not only can I revisit places I've been and love, but I can visit them from a different point of view, and my 'fitness break' just flys by. I also get to go places I've never been and for a person who just enjoys new places and adventures, this is a great exercise solution.

First I timidly tried it with just the music. The next day I tried with one of the coaches, who was supportive and not at all intimidating! I enjoyed it and got one of the best workouts I've had in years.

I loved the little water drops. They made it feel so real. In fact, I loved everything about it and hope to get more of them in the future. These will keep me busy for quite some time.

Anyone can benefit from these. If you are an expert cyclists, you'll just be doing a lot better than the rest of us, but we'll never know.  :)",1267833600,,990,4.082474226804123
3736002,3,B001OQQKOO,"I was very disappointed to pay the amount of money I did for this and find out the quality was so poor. One of the rides had water drops on the lense throughout most of the ride, and the glare from the sun was not filtered well. This was the most amatuer low budget DVD I have every experienced. The only positives were the fact that it was filmed in Hawaii, and when my weather was cloudy and raining outside I could imagine I was in sunny Hawaii. The quality was poor, I feel like I could have done a better job by strapping my own camera on a bike and riding, and I could have my 11 year old fix the imperfections on some digital software program.",1265414400,,650,4.0859375
3736003,5,B001OQQKOO,"These are some incredibly produced DVDs.  The music is fun, the video is well done, and the scenery is amazing.

What really shine are the bonus yoga, weights, and pilates sessions.  If you've never done any of them before, you can see what's involved.  Yoga isn't nearly as scary after watching one of these.",1242950400,2,309,4.666666666666667
3736004,5,B001OQQKOO,"This cycle DVD was so much more than I expected.  I bought the Global Ride: Hawaii Series Virtual Cycling Dvds Boxed Set.  The coaching and music is motivational but not over bearing.  I enjoy both but if you prefer either one can be turned off so you can use your own music.

I look forward to starting my day with the hour plus routine and feel that I get a great workout.  I am sweating buckets when I am done.

There is a bonus at the end of each workout!!!  Pilates, Yoga and strength training.  This is a great end to the exercise and a great start to my day.",1238976000,,565,4.072727272727272
8331283,3,B001OQQKOO,"On the set I received the quality of audio recording is pretty poor. There is a lot I can't hear due to it being muffled. Female coaches are quite difficult to hear as they sound muffled, the men's voice is clearer but again not that great. The camera work is pretty low rate. It looks like they strapped a go pro to a scooter and drove around Hawaii. For a ""professional"" DVD set one would assume a polarizing lens would be used in full sun situations....Nope, you just end up watching washed out full sun filming. The editing is pretty low rent as well. Using this DVD with your bike on a trainer is a little frustrating as the editing style is slash and burn, one minute your ""riding"" along the shore line and all of a sudden it's filmed on some side street. The music used is a artificial techno style, which I personally dislike. One ride was filmed after it rained so you end up with water spots on the lens. Really??? The lens couldn't be wiped off? Or edited out the rain on lens?
My personal opinion is I could of done a better job of filming with my go pro. Had I known how poor the filming, editing and voice recordings were prior to purchase I would of passed on purchasing this.",1393632000,,1191,4.274336283185841
8331284,5,B001OQQKOO,"After having a trip of a life time and visiting Hawaii, these DVD's brought me right back to where I had been and to be able to do so on a virtual bike ride was awesome.  I use these as relaxation and memory makers.  They are truly a great ride through Hawaii and I will continue to purchase these DVDs as they become available.",1378425600,,328,4.109375
8331285,5,B001OQQKOO,"This purchase was worth the cost.  While the big ride I would give 4/4.5 stars, the other two are 5's.  Really kept me engaged.",1377820800,,127,4.25
8331286,4,B001OQQKOO,"I've pruchased the Hawaii, Italy, Spain and France series and love to rotate through them.  They're all very enjoyable.  By buying the various series I can rotate through them with no issue of boredom.  There is a lot of flexibility regarding having a coach along, the music and in some cases the level of difficulty.  I find myself forgeting where I am (unfortunately in the basement on a trainer) and really feel that I'm on vacation in an country town in Europe or Hawaii.  Not sure how I got along in the past by blasting music and staring at a wall.  These DVDs are a necessity if you train indoors to suplement your outdoor training.  A necessity for the winter months if you live in the NE.  More on this specific set... The scenery is awesome.",1376006400,,751,4.470588235294118
8331287,5,B001OQQKOO,"I gave the 3-DVD Global Ride: Hawaii Rides series to my wife as a Christmas gift. After grinding through other spinning DVDs throughout our long winters in Michigan in the past, she was a bit skeptical. That is, until she slipped the first Global Ride DVD, Maui Rollers, into our DVD player. I couldn't get her off her trainer. In fact, her enthusiasm for her Hawaii Rides DVDs were infectious. So much so that I purchased a trainer and am now riding across Hawaii with her. Not only are we having great fun riding together, but we also collectively lost over 50 pounds of weight. We've never felt better! After Christmas this year, we'll be riding together across Spain or maybe Italy...thanks to Global Rides.",1374537600,,711,4.696
8331288,4,B001OQQKOO,"I purchased the global France rides which is very good, I needed something to different to add to my workout and the hawaii ride was on sale, it's a good workout and nice variety to add to my workout. I prefer the format of the France rides I think it's a better product, but th hawaiinrides adds for a change and variety. Both are good solid workouts",1370390400,,351,4.253731343283582
8331289,3,B001OQQKOO,"The island trails and senerie is the best part of these cycling D.V.D.'s. I dislike some of the graphics which is very small and hard to see, also some of the detail is misleading on R.P.M. up hill,downhill gaugeing were ur measurements should be,also D.V.D. 1 starts off with a time count down with no one actually cycling don't know what's that about. Still working on how to fgure d.v.d. 1 out before moving on to the next after 20 minutes of riding on d.v.d. 1 it stops and starts on another trail I guess. So this makes things somewhat confusing.",1369699200,,551,4.465346534653466
8331290,1,B001OQQKOO,"I hate to be negative but the QUALITY of the training and the videography of this product is poor at best.  If you want a great cycling training with great Hawaii views, this is not the series to purchase, i am sorry.  I am not an elitist at all when it comes to training videos, sometimes I still use an ancient step video from the early 80's!",1361404800,,344,4.119402985074627
8331291,1,B001OQQKOO,"Hopelessly bad, grainy, ultra low definition helmet cam shots with an out of breath rider narrating.  My favorite low spot was the rain storm where the film was of a raindrop obscured road with gunk on the camera lens.  Riveting.
Not 1080.  Not 720.  Not even 480.  Think of your grandmas old brownie box movie camera when you imagine the definition.
Save the money, put on a lei and have your spouse sing ""aloha oi"" while you bike.
Honestly, this is so bad it is embarrassing.",1358121600,,477,4.5
8331292,4,B001OQQKOO,"I enjoyed these rides but as others have commented, the voice track is poorly mixed and is much too soft in relation to the music track.  You have to struggle to make out what the coaches are saying (you feel like you are trying to figure out the lyrics to a rock song).  If there were visual cues in the form of a dashboard this would be less significant but even after watching the same video several times, I miss cues to get out of the saddle until I hear instruction to sit back down.  The first of the three videos seems to be the worst but all are hard to hear.  You can turn off the music track but the ride is pretty boring with nothing but the narration.",1330041600,,664,4.084615384615384
