387764,4,6301968964,"This is a superb melodrama about a young man, Paul Boray, from the wrong side of the tracks, who plays a mean violin, and the unhappily married society matron, Helen Wright, who becomes his patron and then his lover. John Garfield is well cast as Paul Boray, the ambitious violinist. Joan Crawford does a star turn as the glamorous and beautiful patron of the arts, who underwrites Boray's big break and ends up falling passionately in love with him. Theirs is a turbulent relationship. He is  singularly devoted to his music, and she is an alcoholic, plagued by self-doubt. They are star crossed lovers whose romance is destined to end tragically.
The film has a magnificent musical score courtesy of violinist virtuoso Isaac Stern. Pianist Oscar Levant is a double threat in this movie, as he, too, does a star turn as Boray's best friend, acting as a comedic foil. He also dazzles on the ivories, playing away so that the viewer wonders why he, too, does not have some society dame underwriting a show for him, such is his talent. All in all, a well cast and well acted film. Fans of Joan Crawford and all those with an appreciation of classical music will especially enjoy this well made film.",1007856000,41,1197,4.672985781990521
387765,5,6301968964,"John Garfield (n Julius Garfinkle) was a rough guy with a sensitive edge, so the part of Paul Boray in ""Humoresque"" was made to order for him: a kid from the streets who becomes a famous concert violinist. Garfield's attractive but implacable persona (he was considered for the role of Stanley in the original stage production of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") meant that he could turn on the charm or turn off the customer at a flick of the switch. Paul Boray knows he has enormous talent and he's ready to share it -- but not his life. When he meets a wealthy neurotic who finds him irresistible you just know there's going to be trouble, particularly when the socialite is none other than Joan Crawford at the peak of her dramatic power. Kids today tend to make fun of Crawford's acting,especially the post-1950 excesses; but the fact is she had an unusually intense presence and a razor-sharp sense of concentration and timing. This is undoubtedly her best performance: her last ten minutes you will never forget. (Incidently, her character doesn't appear till thirty minutes into the picture.) Garfield and Crawford dominate the story (the scenes where she watches him perform leave little to the imagination), so there's not much left for anyone else to do. Ruth Nelson is strong as Paul's disapproving mother, and a young actress named Joan Chandler (you can see her in Hitchcock's ""Rope"") is winning as Paul's pre-fame sweetheart, who waits patiently in the wings -- or, in her case, the orchestra section. Oscar Levant as Paul's accompanist-friend does the cynical curmudgeon thing he was later to do in ""An American in Paris"". It's not as amusing here, partly because this is a serious drama and partly because Levant was five years younger. He has a great line though: when a society matron asks him his relationship to Paul, he says it's the same as that of George Sand to Chopin. The poor woman doesn't register a blink. The screenplay, co-written by Clifford Odets, is controlled with a depth of feeling that later evaded director Jean Negulesco, when he started doing glossy Fox comedies; and it's a shame that ""Humoresque"" was evidently ignored by the Academy. With its moody atmosphere and magnetic stars, it's one of the finest films of the Forties.",996192000,8,2264,4.852713178294573
387766,4,6301968964,"Garfield and Crawford's character are developed with exquisite detail, and this is a great movie.  An added plus is Oscar Levant's presence.  His witty and scathing one liners offered a nice foil to the rest of the story.  Of all of the movies I have seen him in, he plays a lot more piano in this one, which is just awesome and a great sight to see and a great sound to hear.
Joan Crawford is quite a presence, no doubt.  But she overacts BIG TIME in this movie.  She should have offered a little more subtlety to her role.
A good buy.  This is one of the best old movies I have ever seen.",987379200,3,590,4.086956521739131

Even with the brilliant John Garfield as the titular star, when Joan is on screen, you'll look at no-one else.  Treat youself to this one.",981676800,3,370,4.661538461538462
387768,5,6301968964,"Words cannot begin to describe the wonderful feeling one gets upon viewing this motion picture. Joan Crawford delivers an amazing performance as Helen  Wright, the very wealthy and unhappy patroness who is utterly ignored by  her husband. After finding true love with violinist Paul Bolay (John  Garfield), Crawford helps him to rise to fame as she finds that he is  amazingly gifted. But to her dismay, she realizes that the greatest love of  his life is his work and not her. She finds that she has only one choice to  make as their is nothing else left for her on earth. The INCREDIBLY  beautiful and tragic final sequence with Crawford is unforgettable. The  music is wonderful, the cast is outstanding, this is truely a motion  picture to be seen by an appreciative audience.",965088000,7,780,4.804511278195489
387769,5,6301968964,"While watching Joan Crawford play Helen Wright,the bored nymphomaniac in ""Humoresque"",one gets the notion that this is an actress who's not contented with just one AA. This role is generally considered (along with ""Possessed"" (1947) as her finest screen acting. Crawford was intrigued with the character, the likes of which she never played in her glorious days at MGM, and she makes a royal star entrance(she isn't seen until after the first quarter of the movie).Joan never looked more ravishing, nor was her acting ever any more controlled; her restraint in this is admirable. Oscar Levant acts as the comedic counterpoint to maintain a balance in the screenplay -it would have collapsed into hankiedom, otherwise. The score of 23 classical and 7 popular numbers gives the film a place of honour in the history of film music. Garfield's playing of the violin is faked magnificently (it is when Joan hears his playing on the radio that she decides to walk straight into the sea!)",944352000,3,981,4.987804878048781
387770,5,6301968964,"I first watched ""Humoresque"" on December 10, 1990. The date was etched in my brain because I have NEVER been so overwhelmed by pure genius in my life before or since. I have given this movie as a present to all my  friends (birthdays, holidays, etc.). I have watched this film as my  birthday present TO MYSELF. Everyone who sees this film agrees---BRILLIANT.  Joan Crawford and John Garfield play the ultimate codependant couple, long  before modern pop-psychology popularized and distorted the term  ""codependancy."" Joan Crawford had won her Academy Award for  1945's ""Mildred Pierce"" in 1946, during the filming of  ""Humoresque,"" and it shows. Joan Crawford was never more  confident, brooding, steaming, sensual, intelligent or intense on film than  in ""Humoresque."" Everything was perfect for this, the ultimate  film noir----black and white cinematography, art direction, set decoration,  costume design (legendary MGM costume/fashion designer Adrian came out of  retirement just to do Joan Crawford's gowns), make-up, script, cast, and of  course, Joan Crawford's acting and perfectly architectured face. Every  scene and every line are executed perfectly. Post-""Mommie  Dearest"" film fans should watch this and other Joan Crawford films to  get a clearer assessment and appreciation for her work, if not for the  human being herself. Oscar Levant is hilarious as John Garfield's  piano-playing best friend, Sid. Virtuoso violinist Isaac Stern played  violin on the soundtrack (WHICH HOPEFULLY SOME RECORD COMPANY WILL RELEASE  ON CD SOMEDAY), and physically played onscreen in John Garfield's closeups  by placing his arm up Garfield's sleeve. The final sequence with Joan  Crawford's suicidal heroine walking into the sea to the strains of  Garfield's radio performance of Wagner's ""Liebstod"" on violin  (accompanied by full orchestra) is as cathartic as catharsis will ever be  on film. This sequence was recently acknowledged when the director of  Madonna's video, ""The Power Of Goodbye,"" borrowed upon it as the  basis for the storyline of the video, with a  different choice at the end.  It just shows how far we have come as a society in the ability to examine  self-esteem issues, such as codependancy. If you only buy one video in your  life, buy this one. Watch it again and again and again....you will not  regret it. I promise.",943660800,16,2346,5.307901907356948

Crawford, Garfield, and Levant turn in outstanding performances and Garfield violin playing (dubbed by a young Isaac Stern) and Levant piano is some of the best music ever put on film, done by Franz Waxman including a gorgeous transcription of Tristan and Isolde for violin, piano and orchestra.

387864,2,6301968964,"This movie started out interestingly enough, complete with Robert Blake portraying the male lead in childhood. However, once Joan Crawford's character enters the film, the movie seems to become pathetic. This film took full advantage of her propensity for over the top melodramatics, so much so that I found myself sick of her character halfway through the film. The final verbal exchange of two characters at the end of the film left me wondering if someone ended the script because of time constraints.",1485648000,,504,5.0843373493975905

The two are dynamite together added to the rapier wit of Garfield's pianist side-kick and brilliant partner in concert after concert.  Does a great job of portraying a woman hopelessly flawed by alcohol and loneliness only to be tossed through a roller coaster ride with a brilliant violinist who she supports and disagrees with constantly though out the story.

388002,5,6301968964,"I wrote a very brief review of Humoresque when reviewing the TCM Greatest Classic Legends - Joan Crawford 4-DVD set about 5 months ago, but I want to write a longer review of this individual movie...

Humoresque (1946) is a classic Joan Crawford movie from her highly successful tenure at Warner Bros. from the mid-1940s to early 1950s.  The movie is about a violinist named Paul Boray (John Garfield) who is driven to be a great violinist, but his career isn't getting anywhere until he meets a wealthy unhappily married socialite named Helen Wright (Joan Crawford), who helps him advance his career.  In the process, Helen and Paul begin a relationship, but Paul is so driven that the relationship isn't blossoming like it could and should.  Besides that, Helen is a self-centered alcoholic.  I won't give anything away, watch to find out how everything unfolds.  This movie has a lot of memorable lines and a lot of memorable scenes.  Crawford was at the peak of her career in the mid-1940s and looks her absolute best in this movie, in my opinion.  The ending of the movie is, in my opinion, one of the greatest endings to a movie in Hollywood history.

This movie also stars pianist Oscar Levant, Joan Chandler, Ruth Nelson, J. Carrol Naish, Paul Cavanaugh, and a very young Robert Blake (Bobby Blake).  Oscar Levant is very entertaining in this movie, as he provides some comic relief and some wise cracks along with some excellent piano playing.  Every cast member chosen fit their part perfectly and each did a great job.  Joan Chandler's acting is excellent.

The musical score by Franz Waxman is great.  The movie has a ton of music throughout, including the title song and music from some famous composers as well.

One of the extras on this DVD is a short 9-minute segment called ""The Music Of Humoresque"", in which the music of the movie is discussed.

I highly recommend this movie.",1384560000,2,1896,4.752293577981652
388003,5,6301968964,"As a collector of the classic Hollywood movies, and from my favorite studio, M-G-M, I am always pleased to complete my collection with yet another movie from that area. I live in Switzerland, these titles are difficult to get.",1379721600,,226,4.82051282051282
388004,5,6301968964,"HUMORESQUE received a well-deserved Best Music Oscar nomination.

This perfect amalgam of melodrama and classical music stars Joan Crawford as a wealthy socialite who befriends single-minded violinist John Garfield. The deeper this married lady falls for him the more Garfield (as Paul Boray) obsessess over his career.

Violinist Isaac Stern stands in Garfield's playing. Featured music includes interpretations of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Bizet's Carmen Suite, the title song (by Antonn Dvork) and Etude in G flat major by Frdric Chopin. Chain-smoking Oscar Levant, a close associate of George Gershwin, brilliantly plays excerpts of two of his Preludes. Levant, as Boray's long-time friend Sid Jeffers, offers him sound advice and also supplies a needed bit of levity in what is an ever-darkening story, one that ends in inevitable tragedy.

Young Robert Blake is ideal as Paul at age 11. Miss Crawford demonstrates truly enormous talents here; her doomed lover, Helen Wright is a woman you won't soon forget. Mr. Garfield is equally engaging as the unknown musician who, with Helen's help, becomes a national sensation. His steady, masculine performance anchors this movie and provides the perfect foil for Joan's several emotional scenes in what is a rare classic of the studio era. Highest recommendation!

388008,5,6301968964,"I have been buying John Garfield movies off Amazon for a little while now, and every so often they introduce more titles from this often forgotten and greatly underrated Hollywood star and fine actor. In looking the other day for Garfield movies, this title 'Humoresque' popped up. I had not heard of this before even though I am a Garfield fan and decided to buy it to add to my growing collection.

Well, what can I say? The story is a classic American story of the little guy from the neighbourhood made good, which is quite typical of some of Garfield films mirroring his own real life. In some cases Garfield's movies were about the little guy from the neighbourhood made good, or in the case of 'Force of Evil' and 'He Ran All the Way' the little guy from the neighbourhood made bad. Anyway Humoresque is also a love story, basically unrequited love between two people from different walks of life, and at almost two hours the film explores all sorts of themes regarding love and unhappy marriages and so on. Garfield is the brilliant but erratic genius from the neighbourhood and Crawford is the high-society lady with a drink problem in an unhappy marriage. I won't give away the ending but if you like either John Garfield or Joan Crawford I think you will like this film a lot.",1370563200,2,1287,4.571428571428571
388009,5,6301968964,"I don't like the violin, and I don't like Joan Crawford, but I still have to give this movie a 5.

(And by the way, did Joan have it written into her studio contracts that there had to be a suicide or an attempted suicide, or at least serious depressing moves in the direction of suicide in each of her films?)

As a story of musical talent, this movie takes the high road; well, it sort of has to, since the majority of the American public during the period would rather hear jazz or ""popular"" music.  My tastes for movies and music run to the low road, like THE BENNY GOODMAN STORY or THE GLENN MILLER STORY.

Now, a violin player can't succeed by appealing to the crowd directly, because violin players succeed or fail in an upper rarefied market that is subsidized by patrons of the arts.  So the violin player needs a patron.  Or patroness.

I rather identify with John Garfield's talented temperamental artist as he bitches and moans every inch of his way toward success.  I'm something of a social bastard myself.  (Probably why I never get invited back.)  The set-up was nicely structured; the early years of the young violinist; not too much to bore me.  My favorite character was his piano-playing friend, played by Oscar Levant, who played a nice common-sense calming influence on John Garfield's wild ranting about his music, picking apart minor weaknesses in his own playing, and complaining that ""nobody appreciates me.""

The violinist finds his patroness in the Joan Crawford character.

The chemistry between Crawford and Garfield was fun to watch, as they attacked each other as much as they both seemed to need each other.  My favorite scenes were where they were first just getting to know each other.

I hope you like the violin.  @hg47",1368921600,2,1756,4.689542483660131

As for John Garfield: this is one of his finest performances, which is saying a great deal.

Oscar Levant is hilarious and acerbic, as always, functioning as a Greek chorus. (He says of Crawford's character, ""She was born with a silver flask in her mouth."")

And the music! Even people who think they don't like classical music will be entranced by the violin playing (which was actually done by the great Isaac Stern; Levant, who was an accomplished concert pianist, did his own playing).

P.S. Garfield's character as a child is played by Bobby Blake (Yes, that Robert Blake).

388046,2,6301968964,"It's interesting to watch a classic film starring well-known actors and not having any idea of what the story will be about. I had seen HUMORESQUE listed as a well-known Joan Crawford film so I decided to watch it expecting some sort of a romantic light-hearded comedy, which of course, is not the genre Crawford if famous for. I didn't realize that HUMORESQUE has nothing to do with humor but is actually a genre of romantic music. I don't think HUMORESQUE was the best title for this film, but it did catch my attention.

HUMORESQUE is almost a long concert of classical music. If you are a fan of classical music, this movie is worth your time. I had no idea that such a big part of this movie would be classical music performances, especially violin music. This is just my personal preference, but I'm not a fan of violin music.

The movie is off to an interesting start. I immediately recognized the young, adorable kid with a head of black hair as actor Robert Blake. Here was ""Bobby Blake"" decades before his troubles and a cute kid and talented he was. Little Paul Boray wants a violin for his birthday and thanks to his loving mother that is what he gets. He spends his youth practicing and works his way forward. Suddenly he is grown up and I guess would be in his early 20's. Now, adult Paul Boray is played by John Garfield...an actor almost in his mid-30's at the time. The age difference through me off because John actually looked older than he was.

An interesting fact of the movie is that Joan Crawford does not make her first appearance until 30 minutes into the movie. Nothing is rushed in this film. I have watched several Joan Crawford films lately and this is the first time I have seen her as beautiful. Her features are not as severe. She looks more natural and it's easy to believe how her character Helen Wright would be the toast of the town. Again, here is a movie where Joan plays a woman married to a much older man but in love with a younger man. But this time the younger man looks older than her.

There is a lot of over the top high drama in the film as people begin to realize the relationship Paul and Helen have. Helen knows Paul is in love with his music more than with her. The constant musical concerts got to be too much for me, and I was amazed at how it looked like Garfield was playing the violin. In the extra features, Garfield's daughter explains how ""Garfield's"" hands were really Isaac Stern's. Here is another amazing thing about classic films. They could create an illusion very simply and very believably with genuine creativity. It really is John Garfield's body and Isaac Stern's hands playing that violin. Be sure to watch the extras to how simply the feat was done.

I'd recommend this film to fans of classic musical but as far as story, the film is seriously lacking and I was disappointed on so many levels.",1326931200,,2867,4.453333333333333

388052,5,6301968964,"Released Christmas day in 1946 ""Humoresque"" was Joan Crawford's follow-up film after her Oscar-winning performance in ""Mildred Pierece"". In ""Humoresque"" Crawford falls in love with a much younger violinist played beautifully by John Garfield. This was the first movie in which Crawford would play a character in love with a younger man. The chemistry between Joan and Garfield is evident as their characters struggle with different personal demons: Joan's character suffers from a bout with alcoholism and Garfield's character deals with issues from his boyhood. In the flashback scenes Garfield's character is played by a very young Robert Blake (shown in the credits as Bobby Blake) known as TV's ""Barretta"" and in the 2000's for his very public personal problems.

 ""Humoresque"" was well-received by the critics and the public loved it. However, Joan felt she overacted and overreacted in many of the scenes and cringed when she saw the final rushes.

 Jean Negulesco would direct Crawford in 1959's ""The Best of Everything"".

 The film was released individually on DVD in 2005 and was also part of the first Joan Crawford box set that came out that year.",1297728000,2,1158,5.165775401069519

Crawford eventually gets a divorce, and then realizes that Boray's in love only with his music.",1294531200,,505,4.952941176470588
388054,5,6301968964,"HUMORESQUE received a well-deserved Best Music Oscar nomination.

This perfect amalgam of melodrama and classical music stars Joan Crawford as a wealthy socialite who befriends  single-minded violinist John Garfield. The deeper this married lady falls for him the more Garfield (as Paul Boray) obsessess over his career.

Violinist Isaac Stern stands in Garfield's playing. Featured music includes interpretations of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Bizet's Carmen Suite, the title song (by Anton&iacute;n Dvor&aacute;k) and Etude in G flat major by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin. Chain-smoking Oscar Levant, a close associate of George Gershwin, brilliantly plays excerpts of two of his Preludes. Levant, as Boray's long-time friend Sid Jeffers, offers him sound advice and also supplies a needed bit of levity in what is an ever-darkening story, one that ends in inevitable tragedy.

Young Robert Blake is ideal as Paul at age 11. Miss Crawford demonstrates truly enormous talents here; her doomed lover, Helen Wright is a woman you won't soon forget. Mr. Garfield is equally engaging as the unknown musician who, with Helen's help,  becomes a national sensation. His steady, masculine performance anchors this movie and provides the perfect foil for Joan's several emotional scenes in what is a rare classic of the studio era. Highest recommendation!

388074,5,6301968964,"I watched this excellent film with a friend recently.  Of course over the years, I have watched Humoresque many times before and different things jump out at me each time, perhaps the sign of a truly great film.

This time, I found myself wondering about Helen Wright's (Joan Crawford's) frame of mind at the end of the film when she takes her dramatic leave of her lover.  Was she simply losing her mental tether to reality or was she growing emotionally to reach a level of sacrifice?  For a character of this type, and we have little sense of her except as a wealthy wife, she may have had little hope of rebuilding her life around some other center than Paul.  I think that shimmering ambiguity in the character and in Crawford's portrayal is part of what makes the ending as close to totally effective as that of any film that I have seen.

In addition, Paul Boray's (John Garfield's) survival of his affair with Helen to a renewed encounter with his fellow musician and girl friend Gina must give us pause.  Should we cheer or shudder for that girl?  As he fades in the end of the film, this other ambiguity is never resolved.  These complex characters and the waves of ambiguity they generate show screen writing and directorial skill--what a marvelous way to keep us turning the film over and over in our thoughts long after we have finished viewing!

Like a couple of others who have reviewed Humoresque, I will claim that this film's ability to charm does not lessen with a number of viewings.  We may differ in our reasons for finding a new enchantment in the film each time we view it, but it has something special. Maybe Humoresque is not for everyone, but it delights many of us.

PS If for no other reason, then see the film for the excellent musical score and Oscar Levant's ascerbic shots that undercut the main melodrama, providing a commentary.

388077,4,6301968964,"Sweeping, emotional ""women's picture"" from Warner Brothers' 1940's heyday features two strong, memorable leads: John Garfield's driven classical violinist and his rich patron, socialite Joan Crawford.  Both characters are a piece of work, resulting in fireworks (both happy and otherwise) and some genuine complexity as Garfield moves up the ranks and becomes the toast of the classical music world.  The real star of the movie, however, is the music, which is often featured front and center, and at length.  If you're not partial to energetic, dramatic classical music performances, that aspect of the film may bore you a little, but if you do enjoy that sort of thing, you're in for a treat.

Oscar Levant's turn as Garfield's cynical friend, a capable piano player but not quite good enough to be a star performer himself, is also a highlight of ""Humoresque"".  I liked the way he idly played old Gershwin Tin Pan Alley numbers as he argued with his friend about this and that.

The DVD of ""Humoresque"" features a sharp, clean print of the film and an interesting special feature that shows the clever ways the film made non-violinist John Garfield appear like a virtuoso on screen.  For now I'll just say this: it helped that then-newcomer Isaac Stern was a big part of the sleight-of-hand employed.

""Humoresque"" is a polished, well-crafted little gem from Hollywood's golden era, and well worth the time of film fans.",1233273600,4,1423,4.974683544303797
388078,2,6301968964,"Maybe I'm a dyed in the wool old cynic. Perhaps I have no sense of real drama. Or maybe my idea of a great love story is ""Love Story"". But for the life of me, I can not understand what all the fuss is about this sappy old melodramatic yarn. To start with the plot is about as unique as a three-horned unicorn...Boy from the wrong side of the tracks falls in love with a sophisticated upper-class society dame. He uses her to climb to the top of the ladder of his dreams and once he gets there, they both realize they have about as much in common as Abbott & Godzilla.

Really, is it me or doesn't it seem that this dime store romance plays on for a good two plus hours until you'd swear it takes up the better part of a whole day? The first half holds up pretty well...John Garfield struggling to raise above his grocery store humble beginnings, steadfastly clinging to his dream of becomming a concert violinist...Then his big break comes in the form of the wealthly society patron, Joan Crawford. The two engage in a verbal game of callous one-up-manship until she finally falls head over heels in love with him. She bestows him with lavish gifts and introduces him to the most influential people. She guides his fledgling career until he becomes the toast of the classical music world. But is  our boy grateful and dutiful to his patron? Of course not. For his one true love is his art. And like all true artists he cares nothing for fortune and fame, and less for the woman who made it all possible.

But wait, is it too late for him to redeem himself? Can he mend his ways and finally find true love and happiness in his benevolent benifactor? And can Joan Crawford, who has given up everything, her husband, her pride, even the bottle hold out long enough to fianlly have her man? Well I won't give anything away. All I can say is the final twenty minutes is so transparent, so predictable, that even Inspector Clouseau would know how it all ends. Watching the closing sequence of John Garfield performing his violin concerto, while Joan Crawford drowns her sorrow in a barrel full of booze is just too agonizing for me.

On a brighter note, the acting is top notch for these two bonified Hollywood legends. Even the supporting cast, Oscar Levant, Joan Chandler and J. Carrol Naish all contribute stalworth performances. The scenes of Crawford's fabulous Fifth Ave apartment are most elegant. The costumes are flawless and the black & white cinamatography is awesome. Even the music is wonderful. But unfortunately none of this can rescue a plot that is far too cliched, dialogue that is overly cynical, urbane and glib to be real and characters that seem lifeless and void of any true humanity.

What's Helen's problem? Does she attach herself to male artists like Paul because she believes that, as a woman, she's incapable achieving anything creative on her own? Crawford's character wears clothing with enormous shoulder pads--large and out-of-date even by the fashion standards of the time (Gina, the virtuous girl that Paul dumps, dresses in clothing that already looks ahead to Dior's New Look). Helen's big-shouldered outfits give her a masculine look that suggests she longs for the life of fame and achievement that Paul attains (with her financial and emotional support, to her credit). What's stopping her? She's hooked on her husband's money and she's an alcoholic (another black mark against her in Paul's mother's book). Crawford gives a great, scenery-chewing performance. Sure she's a mess, but she's a lot more interesting than anyone else in the film. John Garfield is attractive as Paul Boray and he's a strong actor, but he's left playing second fiddle (excuse the pun) to Crawford's non-stop histrionics. Oscar Levant plays his usual role as the wisecracking sidekick.

Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie.

Forgetting the fact that a charming young woman (Joan Chandler) is already in love with him, and that Helen is married, he begins a dangerous affair with her, not realizing the consequences it could have in regards to his career. His best friend (Oscar Levant) also shares a love for music, but can do little to convince Paul that the affair is destined to fail. Paul's career as a violinist is so busy that he doesn't always have time to spend with Helen, and she begins to resent this more and more.

When Helen's husband grants her a divorce, she rushes to Paul to tell him the good news, only to realize that Paul's first love is and always has been music. Even after all the arguing and fighting Helen and Paul have gone through, they're still deeply in love with each other. After being told off by Paul's protective mother though, she decides that she isn't willing to come between Paul and his beloved music. Paul is then left to pick up the pieces of his shattered life and try to move on with his career.

Humoresque starred two of the greatest stars of the 1940's, John Garfield and Joan Crawford, in one of the most unforgettable screen romances of all time. Garfield was of course famous for playing tough guys, and to see him play a sensitive violinist (with a dark side of course) so convincingly proved just how great of an actor he was. Crawford was likewise fantastic playing another ""bad girl"" without morals. As for Oscar Levant, I think he deserved a best supporting actor oscar for his wonderful performance. He was really a scene stealer and his sharp wit combined with his great talent as a piano player made him a huge asset to the film.

And of course there's the beautiful music of Humoresque which is practically a character in the movie. Rarely have I heard so many masterpieces of classical music in one movie. John Garfield's violin playing was actually done by Isaac Stern, but the incredible contortionist style method they used was so convincing that when Garfield toured the country on publicity tours for this movie he was frequently asked to play the violin! They explain the technique they used to make his violin playing scenes convincing in the brief featurette ""The Music of Humoresque."" Although the original soundtrack is unavailable, there is an awesome CD by Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg titled Humoresque which features a modern version of the film's soundtrack. If you love classic romances with great actors then add this dvd to your collection!",1128816000,29,3593,4.705882352941177
388123,5,6301968964,"At last, HUMORESQUE is on DVD in a fairly decent print! This film, made during the mid 1940s classical music craze that gripped Hollywood (contemporaneous examples include A SONG TO REMEMBER, DECEPTION [with Bette Davis, actually shot on adjoining stages at Warners!], SONG OF LOVE and RHAPSODY IN BLUE) is one of the best and most elaborate. It is hard to imagine a film like this being made today, with huge tranches of classsical works taking up screen time and being rendered so wonderfully. Crawford is at her most maudlin and overacts sublimely. The real outstanding performance however is John Garfield who, in spite of looking like a hoodlum, convinces as a violin prodigy. The unintentionally funny lines (penned by Clifford Odets, no less, mining his play GOLDEN BOY into the bargain!) come thick and fast e.g. ""Bad Manners! The infallible sign of genius"" or ""Martinis are an acquired taste...like Ravel!"".

A grand Warner cast of stalwarts lends support and Franz Waxman adapts and arranges some marvellous music, played exquisitely by Isaac Stern. Oscar Levant contributes his usual laconic humour and also some terrific pianism. Once again, Ernest Haller works miracles with his extraordinary photography [check the anazing shot of Garfield through a Brandy glass at the party scene near the beginning - it took a day to light it]. Jean Negulesco directs with some flair, effortlessly conjuring up 1940s New York making you wish it was as hip and sophisticated today ~ and the final knockout sequence where Crawford walks into the sea (a la A STAR IS BORN) to the strains of Wagner's Liebestod in a superb arrangement for violin, piano & orchestra by Waxman, is so over the top, you can't help but love it. Superbly photographed and edited, it is almost orgasmic! No matter that Crawford's radio would have needed speakers the size of Carnegie Hall for her to be able to hear the music on the beach...that's Hollywood !

The DVD looks pretty good but the print used has clearly suffered with age. No digital restoration was possible as the original camera negative has not survived. Nice featurette on the music and a typically lavish, overblown trailer are the welcome extras. I wish there had been a commentary track as there is so much I wanted to know - for instance, was any of it shot on location and if so, where? All in all however, it's a one-of-a-kind movie and should be in every buff's collection. 5 STARS!",1122422400,11,2431,4.869565217391305
388124,2,6301968964,"I love anything with Joan Crawford or Bette Davis, mainly for the camp element. But ""Humoresque"" is a big fat YAWN.

As you must know by now by reading other reviews, this is a ""story"" (I use the term loosely) about a sex-starved married society woman who falls in love with a ""If I wasn't a violin virtuoso, I coulda been a contender in the boxing ring"" musician.

While this must have seemed like an ""exciting"" premise at the time, this is a ""prop-open-the-eyelids-with-toothpicks"" kind of flick, which was punctuated with unintentionally hilarious moments -- moments, including the penultimate scene (which I won't ""give away"") which make this worth an evening of popcorn and bitchy backtalk to the TV screen.

As for the two stars: Joan (""Helen Wright"") was getting a bit long in the tooth to be a glamour girl, and although she had absolutely fabulous costumes and the sort of wave in her hair that must have taken a team of hairdressers to create, she still looked a bit too old for any kind of hot stud to start foaming at the mouth for.

John Garfield (""Paul Boray"") also was too old to play this part, and far, far too old to be living at home with his parents.

There is not a shred of chemistry between these two and I got the distinct impression that John kept saying to himself during his ""love scenes"" with Joan, ""Ah, hell, it's a paycheck --if they want me to kiss the old broad, sure, I'll do it.""

The ""story"" kicks off with an endless series of scenes about Boray's childhood -- and for about 30-45 minutes I kept asking myself, ""When the hell does this movie start?"" (Note: Robert Blake [!] played the ""young"" Paul Boray!)

Finally, a good 30 years later, Paul somehow finds himself playing violin in the fabulous home of Helen Wright, who apparently has nothing to do for the next 90 minutes but smoke and drink and wear stunning sequin-encrusted gowns.

One of the bizarre things about this film was to give Crawford a prop -- eyeglasses. She puts them on; she takes them off; she asks someone to fetch them for her; she puts them on and takes them off and on and off and on and... -- Jesus, Joan, darling, make up your mind, for God's sake!

There is absolutely no reason for them to have used this prop other than to make Crawford: 1) appear more intelligent; 2) appear nearsighted; 3) give her something to do with her hands other than pick up a shotglass and down its contents; 4) help her to read her cue cards; or 5) distract from the fact that she was starting to look like a transvestite.

One of the great things about watching older films is the mindset that people had to deal with. In ""Humoresque"" it was the supposedly ""shocking"" main relationship between a married woman and a single man. Nowadays, we'd be saying, ""Uh-huh, so what?""

The movie is worth watching to hear the fabulous music of Isaac Stern and to see how they made it appear that John was playing the violin, as well as to hear and see the superb and totally underrated Oscar Levant, as Paul's chump buddy Sid, who was an astonishing pianist who could toss off a complex Gershwin prelude with the sort of panache you'd expect Gershwin to do himself.

But other than the music, it gets old really fast watching Joan upend every glass she sees into her mouth and for Joan and John to smoke enough cigarettes to have given lung cancer to everyone on the set.

At any rate, if you can survive long enough to see Joan's big scene at the end, it's definitely worth it for the good laugh you'll have. Talk about creative choices!",1122076800,9,3522,4.4758190327613105
388125,5,6301968964,"This is a wonderful film but I wanted to warn viewers who are not supposed to be drinking alcohol or smoking:  Joan Crawford is smoking and drinking in each and every scene!  She never puts her glass down and always has smoke coming out of her.  I have been on the wagon for smoking for 16 months now and I would not watch it.  It's not fair for someone else to be smoking when I can't.  Just a simple warning and I do not mean to denigrate the movie.  I think Joan looks her best in this film, she is ultra glamourous and is dressed to kill in every scene.  John Garfield did his finest work and his role is very believable.  The violin music is great, too.  5 stars but be warned, it makes one want a glass of bourbon and a Chesterfield filter tip in every scene.",1117238400,3,765,4.080536912751678
388126,5,6301968964,"I've seen this movie at least a dozen times over the years and never tire of it. So rivetting is Garfield and Crawford's performances that even without the great music it would have still been a great tragic love story (and I'm not one who cares for this genre). The volatility between the two lovers is what makes this movie so great; perhaps because they're complete opposites, or perhaps because the relationship is illicit. No matter, the chemistry between Garfield and Crawford is difficult to deny.

Another point. As a violinist myself Garfield does the most believable job of ANY actor I've seen in ANY movie, and I've seen almost all, that actually appears to be playing, it's almost unbelievable.

Finally, Oscar Levant, who was a great pianist in his own right, especially as an interpreter of Gershwin, does a splendid job as the comic counterbalance to Garfield's brooding intensity, and thought he actually stole some of the scenes with his sarcastic wit.

This movie has it all: great music, great story, great acting. Truly one of my favorites from that era.",1107648000,16,1074,4.8901098901098905
388127,5,6301968964,"An apex of studio movie-making. 40's soap opera simply doesn't come any slicker than this. The black and white photography is rich, glossy, and superb, the luminescent glow behind Crawford's close-ups almost transforming this middle-aged warhorse into a fallen madonna. The screenplay anticipates Garfield's role in ""Body and Soul"" as he claws his way up from poverty using a bowstring instead of fists. For a tough guy, we still believe in his poetic soul and no one from that era was better at combining the two. Then too, no film has communicated an on-screen classical score more effectively than this, as Crawford is alternately beguiled, seduced, and overwhelmed by pulsating strains from the great composers. And, of course, there's that all-time smashing finale so lushly romantic, I'm still picking seaweed from my hair. I'm glad the screenplay gives an obscure contract player like Ruth Nelson a chance to show her thespic talents. Her face-off with Crawford over the direction of Garfield's affections is an epic one, though she's probably a shade too aristocratic for the long-suffering motherly role. Moreover, there are the many memorable throw-away lines, one could expect from a stellar cast that includes Hollywood's master cynic, the mordant Oscar Levant. In fact, his self-effacing personality and casual witticisms are so distractively entertaining, they threaten to undo the entire melodrama. For fans of Levant, it's a showcase, and I wouldn't be surprised if many of those sarcasms were his own. (If only the writers could have dispensed with that dreary stereotype of the wholesome-girl-in-waiting, this time the fresh-faced Peggy Knudsen.) With this film, director Negulesco proves he could spread the soap suds as smoothly as a Douglas Sirk or a John M. Stahl. Without a doubt, this is the Hollywood dream-factory hitting on all eight cylinders in ways that just don't happen anymore.",1103846400,13,1910,5.286184210526316

The acting of both Garfield and Crawford is superb. The role of Helen Wright seems to be the perfect vehicle for Crawford. Oscar Levant excells as a pianist and Garfield's friend. The rest of the strong supporting cast includes J. Carrol Naish, Joan Chandler and Tom D'Andrea. Garfield's violin is played by Isaac Stern.

It would be unfair to say Humoresque is a better film than Mildred Pierce, considering how different the two films are. Mildred Pierce was gritty and dark and strived for harsh realism. Humoresque is romantic and tragic - beautifully written, acted, and filmed. There are moments in movies that linger in your mind a long time after viewing.. The finale of Humoresque is one of those moments. I'm certain I will never forget Joan Crawford's melancholy walk along the sea shore in the moonlight. It is one of the most artistic scenes ever captured on film...and all the emotion Joan goes through is genuine and deep. It is definitely a glimpse through to the heart of Joan Crawford, vulnerable and beautiful, defiant and strong. For in real life, Joan Crawford was never loved. And her character in Humoresque was, as Joan described, ""a woman with too much time on her hands and too much love in her heart."" Perhaps that was the real Joan Crawford, a woman clinging to her career and the fans that loved her, when nobody else did.

It's the beginning of what becomes an uneasy romance with her, as he must battle his music with her, and she must battle with her inner demons with him.  Crawford, linebacker shoulders in place, plays her usual mix of tough vulnerability with intensity.  Garfield is his usual self as well, hardened by life on the outside, trying to fight his love for her on the inside.  The rest of the cast is fine.  The older Crawford got, the more artificial she became, and since I'm not a fan, I find the film hard to swallow just based on her alone.  Ernest Haller does a terrific job lighting her, with lots of shadows used to great effect.  In fact, apart from the stirring music, the photography is the best thing in the film, with a number of striking film noir-type shots.  The dialogue tries for greatness, but except for a few biting comments, fails to be anything but ordinary and melodramatic.  By the end of the film, I was tired of the melodrama, and although the ending is the best part of the movie, I was not unhappy to see it end.  Fans of Crawford will no doubt love this film.

388132,4,6301968964,"""They didn't believe he was my son!""
""I hope that never bothered you before.""
Or words to that effect.
I always liked Crawford - it ain't nothin' fruity, I just always,... y'know... liked her.  Everything she did was over the top (even more so with those eye-brows) and yet she came out of it looking great.  She was a ""working"" Star.  While it was ""Mildred Pierce"" that took the Oscar, ""Humoresque"" is Joan's darkest and deepest performance.  It seems to pick up where Mildred Pierce left off, as if Joan sold the restaurant chain, moved to the big city and drank herself into a pit of despair.
The Story:
Garfield is a son-of-a-grocer violinist determined to go to the top, Levant plays side-kick piano, Joan picks up the tab.
So what's the big deal?
For one thing, Garfield plays a mean fiddle - I'm not talking Pa Kettle, either: the kid's got chops.  Levant plays himself (a talented pianist and genius who in real life defined the concept of bi-polar manic depressive).  Joan plays the near-sighted (she wears glasses as some kind of metaphor) heiress-socialite who takes Garfield's career (and ultimately Garfield) under her wing.  Thing is, Garfield likes her a whole lot, but he likes the violin better.  What transpires is a self-destructive affair that shows some remarkable sexual chemistry (apparently this was an ""off-the-set thing"" too), and some unusually dark twists of character.  The performances are fantastic, particularly in the supporting cast: Mother, Girlfriend, and Crawford's husband (appropriately underplayed by Paul Cavanaugh) are all great.
This movie delivers Film Noire in one of it's strangest forms.  In a genre normally reserved for gangsters and private dicks, the musicians and the music are given a sinister light: most sets are devoid of significant illumination, everything coming from one or two on-set lamps and spots that the actors wander into; the images are all texture, high-contrast, rim lighting and low key - veteran cinematographer Ernest Haller ( ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Rebel Without A Cause"", and ""Lilies Of The Field"") delivers a masterpiece of ""negative space"".  The visual composition and mise-en-scene are remarkably efficient.
The editing is also spectacular, moving from the ""invisible"" style of Hollywood narrative, to some pretty wild montages of ""big city life"" and the crash of `28.  But where the cuts really come into play is in that next-to-last scene where the waves roll in; the last walk along the beach; that guy with the dog...
The music (almost wall to wall), and the on screen-performances are masterfully employed as emotional devices, all leading to Garfield's (and Crawford's) final performance.
Yeah, I know it's just melodrama, but  I think Crawford and Co. genuinely believed in what they were doing  (maybe even Levant believed), and so many moments that might have been badly handled (Joan drunk in the night club) or just ""cute"" (Garfield's father's obsession with statistics) actually move quite well.  In the end they've made a remarkably affecting film.
And how does it all end?
In real life Joan got another Oscar and lived to work with Spielberg; Garfield survived the McCarthy hearings without naming names, but was dead a year later;  Oscar Levant did a night-time talk-show on live TV where, immobilized by despair, depression, and addiction, he might be found collapsed over his keyboard mid-performance.",1012780800,8,3392,5.14

7818015,5,6301968964,"Humoresque was one of the big post-war films of the forties, one of those special films where absolutely everything works. Direction, cinematography, acting, screenplay and soundtrack all work together at a high intensity level. It is arguably the best film by director Jean Neguelsco and stars Joan Crawford and John Garfield. Music director Franz Waxman received an Academy Award nomination for his work on the film.

The film takes its time setting up its story,  spending about half an hour showing the life of Paul Boray (John Garfield), a future world-famous concert violinist, beginning with his childhood on New York's Lower East Side (using some stock footage) on the day he received his first violin as a birthday present. It continues to follow him as he struggles in school and radio orchestras and is befriended by Sid Jeffers (Oscar Levant) and forms an early love attachment with Gina Rommey (Joan Chandler). Thus the first quarter of the film is all John Garfirld's. Then he accompanies Sid to a society party where he meets hostess Helen Wright (Joan Crawford) and from that moment on the film takes off.

Neuelsco got absolutely riveting performances from his stars. This is arguably Joan Crawford's finest performance, far more nuanced and complex than Mildrid Pierce. Crawford seems almost a method actor here, totally becoming Helen, a character quite possibly not very different than Crawford herself. Garfield holds his ground with her, not so easy a feat, and within the plot, I think this is what draws her to him. Married to the aristocratic but weak Victor Wright (Paul Cavanagh) and surrounded by male hangers on, she's used to men fawning over her. But when she berates Boray he stands up and fights back, something she's not used to, something that intrigues her. She becomes his patron and soon he has the right manager who knows the right critics to get his talent discovered and his name known. Interestingly there are no angels here. Boray is vain, impulsive, hot headed, inconsiderate and single minded about music. Helen is domineering, manipulative, needy, insecure, lonely, neurotic and an alcoholic. This was all very grown up for the forties.

Other tensions are added by screenwriter Clifford Odets. Boray is the son of working class parents who own a small grocery shop which the family lives above. Helen and her entire group are wealthy society people who have always had it financially easy. As Sid (Levant ) notes to Helen and Paul, with her townhouse, country house and beach house it's a wonder she knows where she is. The class element is never overdone but it's always there behind everything, even in the way Paul talks (it helped that Garfield was actually from the Lower East Side). There are family tensions, chiefly in Boray's mother Ester (Ruth Nelson) who, looking like she had posed for Grant Wood's American Gothic, who makes it clear she does not approve of Paul's new society friends and especially married woman Helen. Then there's Paul's old flirtation from the music school orchestra days, Gina (Joan Chandler) who still carries a flame for him and of whom his mother approves. All of this comes to a head at the film's intense mid-peak when Paul, in a concert hall, plays the passionate Symphonie Espagnol by Lalo as all three women are in the audience. Helen is positively ecstatic, Ester is disapproving and Gina is completely torn up.

The music is a major element in this film. Of course as Paul is a concert violinist it is going to have to play a part but it does more than provide concert pieces and actually comments on the action at times. Franz Waxman, like most of the first generation of Hollywood filmscore composers came from central Europe and knew a great deal of classical music. To their credit, the audiences of the time would have recognized most of this music. This film would have been ruined if even a skilled composer had tried to make up his own music, so Waxman chose carefully, works that always fit the scene perfectly. Dvorak's lilting Humoresque belies the darkness of the film to follow, implying young Paul's naivete about the world. Von Suppe's Poet and Peasant Overture would be just the crowd -pleaser a student orchestra would perform. Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen (Gypsy Airs) would be just the kind of show-off piece Paul might play to impress the guests at a party. Waxman wrote his own Carmen Fantasie to fit the time alotted by the film. And Wagner's Liebestod (Love/Death) from Tristan und Isolde - in an unusual arrangement for violin, piano and orchestra - provides one of the most intense climaxes one can imagine. The music supports this film magnificently.

Though the film could have degenerated into a standard soap opera, both the screenwriter and director keep everything restrained and real enough, as do the actors. The tragic nature of most of the film is lightened by Levant's caustic quips which he delivers in his way that allows them to be humorous rather than cutting, a special talent of Levant's. You laugh when he says things like, ""Tell me, Mrs. Wrightdoes your husband interfere with your marriage?"" And self-depreciating quips like, ""It isn't what you are but what you don't become that hurts."" I do wish they had given him a few non-quips to humanize his character more but he's mostly there for comic relief.

Humoresque is a top notch forties drama that shouldn't be missed.",1506470400,2,5404,4.912376779846659
