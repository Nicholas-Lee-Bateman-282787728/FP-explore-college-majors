8292082,5,B001D7T6C2,"Both of these movies are enjoyable; my preference is Hanover Street for a number of reasons, not the least of which are some of the runway scenes with the superbly restored B-25 bombers.  Unless the dialog was dubbed, which i doubt, Christopher Plummer's German and French are impressive; OK, he's Canadian so the French is no surprise, but his German sounds near native.  LeslIe Ann Down is very easy to watch.  In my estimation, Hanover Street is a much underappreciated movie.  Random Hearts has an interesting story line.  Good entertainment.",1355702400,,546,5.022222222222222
8292083,5,B001D7T6C2,"Loved both DEV's.  Was a baby in Eng. in WW2, so certainly enjoyed seeing that movie, and Randon Hearts, just loved that movie, seen it 2 or 3 times already.",1349222400,,157,4.233333333333333
8292084,5,B001D7T6C2,"""Hanover Street"" has excellent actors - Harrison Ford and the beautiful Lesley-Anne Down.  It is a romantic action/drama that takes place during war-torn Europe. You see how three people's lives are unintentionally intertwined, and I felt sympathy for each of them.  The movie has a very surprising ending, and it made me realize how often fate comes into our lives.

""Random Hearts"" is an intriguing mystery and, again, Harrison Ford plays his role very well.

I felt this double feature 2-DVD set was a good buy from Amazon for the entertainment it provided and for the price I paid.  I will buy several more to give as gifts to my famiy members.",1347062400,,648,4.75
