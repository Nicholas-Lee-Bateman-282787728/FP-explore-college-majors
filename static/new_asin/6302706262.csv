496100,5,6302706262,"If you have read my other reviews you know that I have been a  wood butcher for some time. Kelly is the master of the table saw. This video is for New Guys and Intermediates (Journeymen Carpenters). Kelly actually takes the saw apart and puts it back together explaining how it works. Kelly informs us and gives us his reasons as to why we should do it this way.

I am pretty good at sawing on my older model belt driven Craftsman. And for many of us that is what we can afford. Well that is why this DVD is a winner. Kelly shows us how to adapt our tool, align our tool, and use our tool, with saftey in mind at all times. I have been a yearly maintenance person, but accuracy is important in making joints and we are show how to keep our saws in tune.  I will spend more time keeping my machine tuned up.  Kelly also demonstrats Jigs for accuracy in cutting small to large size unwieldy pieces, as well as adapting fence rails for thoese who can't afford a more expensive fence.  So as I have said previously, ""Thank You"" to Tauton Press for putting these video helpers on DVD. Since I don't have someone to show me well learned short cuts and improved efficiency, I read. I visualize and I practice, and I also see what I might do different or better. Old timers might be amused, but we intermediates say ""Oh, Yah I could do it that way.""  I look forward to Taunton turning out more DVD's. I need a mentor, but this is the next best thing.",1097107200,15,1442,4.206521739130435
496101,4,6302706262,"The video is an excellent introduction into using the table saw correctly. I like the fact that Kelly doesn't use his Unisaw to show the work, but borrowed at contractor saw from a friend. This way he showed that you can do excellent work without high end equipment. The section about the crosscut sled was a little long.",1009929600,,321,4.551724137931035
496102,1,6302706262,the quality of the production of this videao was sad;every few minutes th screen went blank sometimes cutting off kelly mehler while he was talking. i was so disappointed by the video i called Tauton books and videos to ask for my money back.,1003449600,,242,4.5227272727272725
496103,5,6302706262,"I especially enjoyed the video because the saw Mehler uses is the one I own.  The instruction is very clear and easy to follow. This video should be viewed by everyone before they ever use a table saw and by those of us who have used one for years.  I now know how to get the most out of my saw; maintain, calibrate and use my saw safely. I also now know how to make some inexpensive accessories. Own a table saw? Watch this video.",995760000,4,431,4.0588235294117645
496104,5,6302706262,"This video should come with every table saw.  Kelly Mehler's presentation is excellent - 70 minutes of clear, practical advice on how to set up and use your saw.  He moves through the full range of topics I hoped he would  cover without dragging or filler (e.g., saw set up; blade selection;  cutting large, small, angled and duplicate pieces; simple jigs to aid those  cuts; related shop tips).  Look at the reviews of his ""The Table Saw  Book (A Fine Woodworking Book)"" to get a better picture of what this  video is about. I bought the book and like it, and paged through other  books in bookstores, and I rank this video as the best first purchase.",949881600,20,652,4.504273504273504

7829608,5,6302706262,"I had this video several years ago when it was VHS. I recently reordered it in the current DVD version. The audio level on the DVD I received is not uniform but there is no better content on any other source that I am aware of. I am retired from construction and, in my opinion, this DVD by Kelly Mehler covers all aspects of table saw tune up and safety including how to build a couple of jigs that greatly enhance the accuracy of cutting material on a table saw. This is a great resource for novice or journeyman.",1439942400,,515,4.212121212121212

7829611,2,6302706262,"I started woodworking a year ago, purchasing equipment etc, and was clueless as to how to properly setup woodworking tools (table saw) and didn't realize how impearitve this is for precision cuts. I first looked online, watching several videos and tutorials, how to set up a table saw before turning on my table saw and making any cuts. I found the information online to be incredibly detailed and thorough when setting up a table saw. I was told this is the best DVD to understand how to set up a table saw, not even close to the truth.
If you must purchase this DVD, beware that this is very boring, often vague, and not all that detailed. I would only recommend this DVD if you are brand new to woodworking, live in a place where you don't have Internet, and want a general overview of how your saw works and how to clean it.
Save the money you would otherwise spend on this DVD and purchase some ""hardboard"", MDF, or melamine to make jigs for your table saw after watching better videos online.

7829612,5,6302706262,"Presented by a master carpenter, this video is extremely valuable.  It shows how to set up your saw to produce accurate work, how to align the whole saw in every dimension, and to use it safely. Beyond safety, it shows you the essentials of doing precise work.  Seventy minutes of intensely useful information.
While artistically superb, my copy had a minor audio problem (to do with mono sound switching between speakers.  Taunton graciously sent my another copy, no charge, a year after my purchase.
Another reviewer said it's no longer available.  I think it is.
I was so impressed by this DVD I bought Taunton Press's Mastering Woodworking Machines - another first-class instruction DVD.",1284681600,,691,5.035087719298246
7829613,5,6302706262,This was a great companion video to his book.  I tried to buy it (a friend who let me watch his wouldn't sell it or lend it) and found it was discontinued so I got it from the library and tried to make a copy of it.  It's copy-protected.  What a loss of a great resource!,1222905600,,271,3.8035714285714284

I have made multiple cutting boards with my new found table saw skillzzz.  I can ensure you will too.  Pick up this dvd and you won't regret it.
