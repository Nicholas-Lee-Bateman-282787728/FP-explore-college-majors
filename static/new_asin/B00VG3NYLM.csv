7089055,3,B00VG3NYLM,"I like the concept but was very disappointment with the execution. The lead character was selfish, nave and idiotic. There were too many well fed characters in a world where even the basic needs are barely being met. The bad guys seem to have their act together even with a few knuckle heads making bone head mistakes, yet the good guys (or models with attitudes) keep making screw-ups or self-indulgent decisions. The bad guys especially Neville I felt carried the show.

Still it had promise I wish it did continue. It was getting interesting.",1440892800,4,545,4.797872340425532

So much of Revolution is predictable
So many stereotypes

Its real a love affair of two childhood buddies who are inseparable with perfunctory girlfriends providing covers except they aren't fooling anyone except maybe themselves

Irritants  a spoiled self absorbed teenage girl who gets people killed because she does whatever she wants & doesnt listen

A weak nerd millionaire who is afraid of everyone & everything

A mother who abandons her husband, daughter, and son for reasons that takes multiple episodes to partially explain

A cold blooded killer who does terrible things which are never quite explained except that he created a Police state so he can be the hero to his childhood best friend who plays the power hungry warlord baddie

15 years of suddenly no electricity yet no one seems to feel compelled to do anything about it for years

Mysterious nanotechnology that is omnipresent omniscient which is woken up to take over fireflies, rats, and humans

I couldn't wait for this series to end & was so thankful I wouldnt be subjected a third season",1515283200,,1147,5.015873015873016
7089063,5,B00VG3NYLM,"AWESOME SHOW! Interesting plot, solid writing, and intriguing characters. ALL AROUND AWESOME.",1514160000,2,93,6.833333333333333
7089064,2,B00VG3NYLM,"Something to watch if you're desperate to pass the time. Horrible writing, terrible acting, and a poorly developed plot. It's rare for five minutes to pass without someone being punched, stabbed, or shot. Dialogue that often seems like it was written by a child. I'm amazed that this series lasted two years, it should've been cancelled after just a few episodes.

This complete series box set contains season one and two in their original DVD packages with an outer cardboard slip cover.",1509321600,3,488,4.951219512195122

7089075,5,B00VG3NYLM,Definitely worth watching. It's top 3 on my list 1st being the walking dead. This is tied in 2nd with supernatural and that's only because supernatural has more seasons. Great characters and actors. Sebastian Monroe is a bada$$,1478736000,7,227,5.0
