What I did not expect was the bad language. I expected it to be more of a Christian film that I could watch with my family. The F word is thrown around several times, quite often,  as well as a list of other bad words. This really surprised me. For that reason, It is not a film that I can watch with my children.

7306333,4,B0108N99DM,"The Surface, while slowly paced and only superficially storied, is a passable movie. Sean Astin's name recognition is perhaps the more lucrative reason to watch it, but the somber backdrop to the movie provides an intrigue for the day-to-day aspects in life that most people will take for granted. I wish Astin and the other actors could have been given more leeway to really dig down and make the story somewhat beefier, but I was pleasantly surprised by the cerebral theme.",1517011200,,475,4.8765432098765435

This is a film for people who have had some life experiences and understand both the subtleties and catastrophes of human existence, and their transformative effects.

After leaving shore he runs into the  wreckage of an airplane that had crashed and rescues the pilot. So, there they are stuck in the middle of the Great Lakes with a damaged boat.

7306355,2,B0108N99DM,"Numerous script problems, weak dialogue and poor acting. Also, a lot of so-called bloopers or mistakes that also make this a lack-luster film. For example, when the Coast Guard rescue helicopter hovers above the sinking boat, they drop the rescue diver a long distance from the distressed boat and make him swim a long distance instead of dropping him near the boat. I guess this was done for dramatic affect, but it's pretty unrealistic. Also, the next scene has the rescue helicopter leaving the uninjured guy in the sinking boat (I'm pretty sure the Coast Guard would rescue him too) then at the same time a large pleasure craft happens by which will rescue him. These are just a few of these type of issues that marks some pretty amateurish screen writing and/or directing. In all, a slow and poorly executed film.",1505001600,,818,4.767605633802817

7306385,4,B0108N99DM,"This film cast me back to the 80s film My Dinner with Andre. Although the conversation here isn't nearly as witty, urbane, or wide-ranging, as it was with Andre  this movies core is also just a conversation between two men who better define themselves and find themselves in the course of their exchange. This time, the conversation is literally free-floating.

But theres a lot more on this DVD than the minimalist dialog of the drama itself. I was surprised to find the DVD also contains a full-length documentary aimed at raising awareness about the need to protect the Great Lakes. This documentary is a bit flat, but is an earnest attempt to awaken us all to our duty to protect this resource against pollution, against invasive species, and against other threats - in the course of our intimate interaction with it.

Then the commentary that you can turn on to accompany the fictional film also emphasizes the need to cherish our fresh water resources. So the Great Lakes in general, and Lake Michigan in particular, is the real star of this DVD. The water doesnt get dramatically rough, as is misleadingly depicted on the DVD jacket. But theres a subtle drama here as the lapping of the water brings the men to a more contemplative appreciation of what they might yet accomplish in life.",1450310400,,1294,4.767857142857143

7306408,1,B0108N99DM,"This is a total piece of crap film, virtually suspense-less and a total waste of celluloid.  And I say that as a Sean Astin fan - his agent screwed the pooch on this deal.  The movie is a total FRAUD, starting with the promo picture you see before you.  THERE IS NO ""PERFECT STORM"" SCENARIO, THERE IS NO KILLER WAVE, and the rescue scene does not happen in the middle of a storm.  It happens in broad daylight and is anti-climactic.  Without being a spoiler on this, it should best be titled ""Two Depressed Guys Stuck in a Boat on Lake Michigan"".  BUT WOULD YOU RENT A MOVIE WITH THAT TITLE?  No, of course not.  Also, I am torqued at Amazon for selling this film as a rental in HD, when the HD version appears to be nothing more than enhanced SD.

So, even if you are a Sean Astin fan, you will find this movie a waste of $4 and 2 hours of your life.  If you want a real suspenseful ""at sea rescue"" movie, watch ""PRESSURE"".  That is a very suspenseful film that is worth your time.  This is pure crap.  Given the fraudulent promo photo, I WANT MY MONEY BACK.",1445731200,7,1059,4.157635467980295

Instead, there was no giant wave as the cover photo shows and the helicopter was only needed to airlift one of the two people in the boat to a hospital.

7306410,5,B0108N99DM,"Sean Astin and Chris Mukley provide fine performances in director Gil Cates Jr. suspenseful film centered on two desperate men who have a chance meeting in the middle of Lake Michigan. Mitch (Astin) is determined to kill himself because he blames himself for his father's death in a factory accident. Kelly Enright (Mulkey) crashes his plane into the Lake while on a delivery of a backpack with $125,000 for either drugs or black market human body parts. Both men are desperately searching for hope and identity in their lives. The videography is stunning, and the writing creates a realistic give and take of hostility until each man realizes he must depend upon the other for survival. The film begins with a dream-like sequence of Mitch preparing for his trip out onto Lake Michigan (and his eventual suicide). He meticulously preps for his day, fills a bird feeder with enough seed to last several weeks, then visits his mother in a nursing home (who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease). After making certain that everything he is leaving behind is in order, Mitch motors his father's small fishing boat out into the lake. Soon Mitch discovers the wreckage of a small plane and pulls the pilot (Kelly), who had been clinging to part of one of the wings, into his craft. The remainder of the film entails Mitch and Kelly discussing bleaker anecdotes of life that all of us experience and, often, keep to ourselves. Mitch has suffered the loss of his girlfriend through a skate boarding accident, the death of his father through the warehouse accident, and his mother to Alzheimer's. Through a chance cell phone call from the men who are awaiting Kelly's arrival with the money, Mitch is able to contact 911 and both men are rescued by the Coast Guard stationed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By the time of the rescue both men have helped each discover that hope survives. As Kelly said to Mitch during one of Mitch's self-indulgent diatribes, ""...don't do that to yourself [...] people have choices..."". This is a must see indy film. The acting is sound, the writing is crisp and honest, the directing is  insightful, and the videography is stunning and haunting.",1445212800,,2164,4.86449864498645

When I realized what was going on with the main characters, I really did feel bad for both of them. Sean Astin's character mentions people being put in your path for no apparent reason who can save you (something along those lines). This story really makes you think about those people who've been put in your own path that you're thankful for. Someone can make a huge impact in a short period of time. And these guys help one another.
