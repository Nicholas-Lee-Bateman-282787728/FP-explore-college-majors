5931809,5,B00EOS48FC,"The Octonauts are wonderful teachers about everything that concerns our Oceans & Seas! My 5 3/4 year old granddaughter has watched them for a couple of years on T.V. & my 2 year old great grandson has watched them for about 1 year. When the DVDs became available, I bought all of the ones I could find. The DVDs not only teach them about our Earth & Seas but they also teach them about why we need to take care of our planet & respect nature of all kinds in an entertaining fashion that leaves them glued to the T.V. & not get bored! This set includes:

- Here Come The Octonauts
- Underwater Rescue
- Ready for Action

Most of these are available separately but if you have one already, it is still cheaper to buy the set & have an ""extra"" in case one of the DVDs get damaged (my 2 year old great grandson likes to take them out of their package & tries to put the DVDs into the player by himself if you're not quick enough to put them in for him!).  I even have enjoyed them & learned many things about our oceans & seas & I'm 68 years old!",1436659200,3,1042,4.048543689320389

5931815,5,B00EOS48FC,"My son just turned 4 and is OBSESSED with Octonauts! He never got a hang of talking until he started watching the show. He was so into it that he copied every line and now he talks like anyone else his age. I'm so glad they finally came out with a US compatible DVD set. We've been waiting for a long time for this. So excited. Thanks Meomi!!

We even got him an Octonauts backpack and Peso and Captain Barnacles for Christmas shipped all the way from the UK to California. He has to have them with him anytime we leave the house. :)",1390003200,9,533,4.125

5931817,4,B00EOS48FC,"This set covers several adventures and all are great fun!  These are eco-friendly DVDs that teach kids a lot about the ocean and it's living creatures!

My 3 yr old grandson finds the characters fascinating and identifies best with the patched-eyed one.

Quite enjoyable--even for grown-ups with a kids heart and interest in preserving our planet's ocean-life!",1388707200,4,360,5.280701754385965
5931818,5,B00EOS48FC,"This was on our wishlist for friends/family who needed ideas for my 2 boys (1 and 4 years old). And this was a winner Christmas gift for both them and the parents!!! So far we have just played the 1 DVD and it has 5 episodes. The best part is, after playing to the end, the disc will wait for 6 seconds or so before it replays automatically! This is fantastic for busy parents doing other things (or have guests over) and kids who just want to watch Octonauts. I plan on also taking these DVDs on road trips!!!
The Octonauts itself has teaches about underwater creatures that we'd normally not get a chance to understand all around the world. It truly is unique and great for kids of all ages (and adults).",1483142400,,706,4.315789473684211

5931832,5,B00EOS48FC,"FINALLY!  For those that have been searching for the same (Region 1) version that's currently on NetFlix, THIS IS IT!  For those not in the know, the voices are different on the AU and the US versions, which - NetFlix streams the US versions (at least, in the US - which is where I am located).

The different voices are something that my daughter (age 6) is always a little confused about...SO glad to finally have this version on physical media - I just know that NetFlix will stop streaming it soon, so - very happy to have the backup.  Can't wait for MORE!",1448409600,25,560,4.355769230769231
