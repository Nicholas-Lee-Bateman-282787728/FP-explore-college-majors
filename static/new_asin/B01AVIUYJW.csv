I also tried to download the digital copy and it did not work either.  I watched this movie on a Delta flight and was really looking forward to having a copy.
I just looked further in the details about the product and it is Region B2 which does not work on players in the US.  It would be great if the seller would indicate this more strongly.",1496016000,,476,4.075268817204301

8748577,2,B01AVIUYJW,"I watched about a third of this movie on a flight home from Montreal.  It's a great movie.  However, the movie is in French and unfortunately, this DVD (unlike the movie on the plane) does not have English subtitles available.  Hence, the two star rating.  With English subtitles, I would probably rate the movie four or five stars.",1469836800,,332,4.672413793103448
