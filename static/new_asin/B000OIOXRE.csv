8185247,3,B000OIOXRE,I think over all its an ok movie kind of weird at times and a bad ending I thought it would've been a better movie by the awards it received but the casting was good the way the movie was made was good but the story kind of weird its a movie worth seeing just don't expect too much out of it.,1333411200,,292,3.725806451612903
