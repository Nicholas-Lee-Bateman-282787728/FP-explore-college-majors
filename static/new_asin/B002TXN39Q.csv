For anyone who is interested in Malta or lost civilizations as well as Stonehenge this video would be of great interest. Malta has the oldest structures in the world even older than Stonehenge which until recently was beleived to ne the oldest.  I have visited the Hypogeum in Malta and this video does it justice.",1350950400,3,404,4.534246575342466
8380765,5,B002TXN39Q,"This documentary has something for anyone curious about the oldest known civilization in the world. On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, five 6,000-year-old temples--1,000 years older than the Pyramids and 2,000 years older than Stonehenge--reveal that the people of 4000 B.C. were quite sophisticated about geometry, astronomy, engineering, acoustics, and more ... and combined these skills with artistry.

I would recommend this film to anyone studying anthropology, architecture, art or art history (the sculptures and pottery are amazing, and beautifully well preserved). There are also some intriguing finds about acoustics: These people deliberately manipulated sound at 110 hz; from a chamber in the Hypogeum temple, a low male voice will carry throughout the whole three stories of the structure.

Aside from the scientific information, the footage is spectacular and one-of-a-kind. Unless you go to Malta, I don't know how else you could see the incredible Hypogeum. Five temples are well-preserved works of spectacular complexity: Ggantija, Hagar Qim, Mnajdra, Tarxien and the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum (an underground mausoleum and temple, curvaceous like a Gaudi-designed interior).

The temples work as calendars, and the south temple at Mnajdra tells the time by the sun's position, every day. Architecturally magnificent, the temples were built with systems of inner and outer walls, ring compression, and ""head and chaser"" formations. The earliest known use of forecourts, retaining walls, corbelling and horizontal arches are all found here.

The artworks found in the ancient temples are not only beautiful in their own right, but were also made with ball-and-socket joints to allow their heads to move. Among the most remarkable artifacts of Malta's temple culture, the gorgeous ""Sleeping Lady"" was found in the underground Hypogeum ... along with the bones of thousands of people. Any DNA found in those bones will be a very significant source of information.",1261008000,6,1977,5.58
8380766,5,B002TXN39Q,"For me, watching this was like looking inside some archaeologists secret notebook before the rest of the world knows about it.  What it gave me was a collection of all these tantalizing hints about people that I never even knew existed.  You'd almost think it couldn't be real, because we would have heard more about it, but there it is!  I felt like it was a privilege to see this before the fiction writers and movie people catch onto it.  There was so much to think about.  It was way more than a description of the wonderful ruins.  Bravo.  I can't wait for more!",1260230400,4,567,4.394230769230769
