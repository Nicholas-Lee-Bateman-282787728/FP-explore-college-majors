7480414,5,B016WSGTOE,"Excellent film, I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. There is a sophisticated yet simple sense of humor to the dialogue that a person can't help but ""lol"" to. The artistic angle of each scene is on-pointe and visually interesting. The characters are relatable yet flawed; and each character's personality, story and likability build throughout the film... making the viewer question who's motives he/she is rooting for and why. There are unexpected twists and turns that keep the viewer glued to the screen.
The acting is raw, real and vulnerable. Each actor in this film carves out their own completely independent narrative and effectively makes the viewer see things from his/her point of view.
Ultimately this is an extremely enjoyable, well executed independent film and I can't wait to see more from these talented directors.",1455667200,,845,5.220588235294118
7480415,5,B016WSGTOE,"Gave this a look and...wow. I'm truly impressed. A low-budget indie with excellent performances all around and a compelling story throughout. Though the film is more thriller than horror, it does deliver some occasional scares and cringe-worthy gore. And it has some great laughs! Highly recommend this under-the-radar gem.",1455667200,,323,5.612244897959184
7480416,3,B016WSGTOE,"The Badger Game is about a blackmail plan gone wrong. Liam (Sam Boxleitner) is a successful businessman whose girlfriend, Alex (Augie Duke), discovers that hes married with a family and resolves to exact revenge. Enlisting the aid of her brother, Kip (Patrick Cronen), her former best friend, Shelly (Jillian Leigh), and another of Liams mistresses Jane (Sasha Higgins), Alex comes up with a scheme to kidnap Liam and extort $2 million from his private accounts. The title of the film refers to a method of blackmailing married men by intentionally placing them in a compromising situation.

Since none of the kidnappers is a professional criminal, things backfire from the outset, spiraling from one wrong move to another. What appeared to be a simple plan becomes complicated by the various relationships between Liam and each of the kidnappers, the original plan changes, and things turn violent.

Directors Josh Wagner and Thomas Zambeck provide greater depth of character than one customarily finds in low-budget horror flicks and lace the proceedings with generous helpings of dark humor. The unrated film becomes jarring when splashes of blood and other graphic images are introduced, but the blend of violence and humor works, and the plot creates enough suspense to keep the viewer on edge and involved.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include audio commentary with writer/directors Wagner and Dambeck and stars Augie Duke, Jillian Leigh and Sasha Higgins, and cast and crew interviews from the Los Angeles premiere.",1447891200,6,1532,5.270491803278689
8737428,4,B016WSGTOE,"**** 3-1/2 Stars **** Just a bit of clever, nasty fun - very well-made and acted, we all liked it and nearly forgot to finish our popcorn and beers.  Honestly, it moves along at a steady pace and the characters are so interesting (and entirely unreliable) you won't regret your time watching this twisty little flick. Not a ""B"" movie at all, this is a very professional indie crime thriller that you will want to share with friends.  Thanks for reading!",1494806400,,453,4.580246913580247
8737429,2,B016WSGTOE,"I made it all the way through, but it wasn't easy.  I kept thinking, this is a  really good screenplay, but it just doesn't have the right actors and director to bring out its full potential.  This is one of those movies that looked promising, but now that I've seen it, I have no desire to ever watch it again.  And it wasn't cheap.",1467331200,,333,4.15625
8737430,5,B016WSGTOE,"A fun indie thriller with great characters. This is what you can do with a small budget and some imagination, people! If you think you've had a bad day, watch what the characters in this movie go through when their ""simple"" kidnapping/extortion plan goes wrong.",1459296000,,261,4.822222222222222

8737432,1,B016WSGTOE,"If you are desperate... This is quite a bad movie -- terrible acting (except for the actor who plays Shelley), not much plot, uninteresting gore. I did get through the whole thing though, so that deserves a star.",1459036800,,212,4.605263157894737
8737433,4,B016WSGTOE,"When a young woman discovers that her wealthy boyfriend is married, she and three friends hatch a kidnapping-and-extortion scheme known in criminal circles as a badger game to teach him a lesson and score an easy $2 million. But they'll soon learn certain games can quickly spin out of control...and that one seemingly perfect crime is about to go horribly wrong. This was the description given and now for mine. I totally enjoyed this little indie and low budget gem. The performances were above average all around. The story was fun the blood and gore were top notch too. If I had only one complaint is that the kidnappers did not know that the ""victim"" had a blood disease. (Hemophilia) this is big and they should have known. The kidnappers are an odd bunch that had no business planning anything...I wouldn't let them plan a picnic! All and all I do recommend this fun little movie. You won't be watching a big budget film, so realize that going in.",1458777600,2,954,4.650887573964497

8737436,1,B016WSGTOE,"I was only able to last a few minutes because the acting, writing and production values were so atrocious.  I started watching this - I can't in good conscience call it a film - on the strength of the existing reviews.

It is evident the reviewers were either paid or have some connection with the film.  This is dishonest and is a disservice to the rest of us who are simply trying to find a decent film to watch.  This isn't the first time I've seen this and I wish there was something Amazon could do to curtail this practice.",1456876800,2,529,4.26
