2862798,5,B000R9CO94,"This was maybe only about a 20 minute promotional movie,but was very enjoyable,albeit...while I enjoyed seeing Norma Shearer in this {which was the main reason I got this for as am collecting all of her movies that I can find on dvd}....I must admit..I would really have liked to see other stars like Clark Gable,Jean Harlow,and Carole Lombard who always one for a good cause",1402876800,2,375,4.7846153846153845
2862799,3,B000R9CO94,A chance to see a large group of film stars from the 1930's doing a fund raiser for tuberculosis and sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes !,1398643200,,139,4.6
2862800,3,B000R9CO94,"As a fundraiser for the National Variety Artists Tuberculosis Sanitarium, all of the major studios of the day contributed resources - including several of their biggest stars - to this 20-minute comedy short about an attempt to locate Norma Shearer's valuable jewelry.  Never mind the paper-thin  plot - it's just an excuse to cram in brief bits by Laurel & Hardy, Our Gang, Buster Keaton, Wallace Beery, Edward G. Robinson, Fay Wray, Irene Dunne, Barbara Stanwyck, Loretta Young, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier & more.  If you're a fan of early 1930's Hollywood, this is slight but pretty irresistible.",1395187200,4,626,5.178217821782178
2862801,4,B000R9CO94,"Not much content and fuzzy quality, but a really fun opportunity to see a lot of famous stars in the early 1930's!",1395100800,,114,4.2272727272727275
2862802,5,B000R9CO94,A Who's Who of film stars from the '20's and early 30's. I had previously seen stills of this short and was finally able to enjoy watching the film itself.,1393632000,,155,4.2
2862803,2,B000R9CO94,I love Laurel and Hardy. This was nothing. It was just a flimsy film patched together to show the stars in a very weak story.  Dialog hard to understand. You need to be very knowledgable of the era to know who was who in this thing too. Interesting to see some of theses stars I have heard of and not ever seen.,1387756800,,311,4.016129032258065
2862804,3,B000R9CO94,"This little short was mildly amusing to watch. Sadly was not that great a piece as a whole item, but little segments with some of history's most memorable actors and actresses make it worth the time. L&H and their traditional car gag...was my favorite.",1384300800,,252,4.75
2862805,2,B000R9CO94,It was interesting to see the stars.  But the material was awful. I thought it was a laurel and hardy short. It was not. They were only in for a minute,1359849600,,151,3.870967741935484
2862806,5,B000R9CO94,"Film buffs will be absolutely delighted to own this twenty minutes of unmitigated fun. The Stolen Jools (a.k.a. The Slippery Pearls) is a merry little short with so many early 1930's stars showing up in its brief running time that one needs a scoreboard to keep track of them all! Ironically, this gemstone intended to help fight tuberculosis and raise money for a Hollywood sanitarium was sponsored by Chesterfield! The cigarette is prominently displayed and smoked throughout.

You can sense everyone from Buster Keaton to Richard Barthlemess is having a grand time when it is discovered Norma Sherarer's jewels have been lifted. Edward G. Robinson was stealing them for himself and had them taken from him. Shearer is a sheer delight pleading for the detective to find them while Laurel and Hardy wait outside. Before you can say Warner Baxter, Joan Crawford, a rival of Shearer's, is questioned. It turns out all she took from the party was a cute little dog, however. Styme and Chubby from the Our Gang shorts add to the search, and Irene Dunne describes the missing jewels perfectly, yet claims not to have ever seen them!

Word about the theft reaches Chief Gary Cooper, and the famous suspects just keep on comin'! Making an appearance are Barbara Stanwyck, Buddy Rogers, Fay Wray, Bebe Daniels, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Loretta Young, William Haines, Eugene Pallette, Claudia Dell, and a very funny Wheeler and Woolsey. And that's simply the tip of the iceberg! Though it may be short, you'll have to watch it several times to catch everyone. From Bebe Daniels to Ben Lyon, Fay Wray to Wallace Beery, you'll have a ball picking out a big star you missed the second or third time around.

This is also available with a terrific ""B"" mystery, Dragnet, from another company. Either way, it is a must own curio for real fans.",1266796800,5,1830,4.840255591054313
2862807,1,B000R9CO94,"This short subject was a promotional film made in 1931 to aid in collecting for charity. It is cute enough and notable for the appearances - however brief - of so many stars in one film including Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Edward G. Robinson, Wallace Beery, and of course, Norma Shearer, whose jewelry has been stolen. It is also included on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comedy-Classics-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0001HAGV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>&nbsp;for just a little more than is being charged for this one so-so short film. Plus you get a total of 50 films including a bunch of Buster Keaton short silent films, an Ernst Lubitsch - ""That Uncertain Feeling"", and an odd little comedy starring James Cagney entitled ""Something to Sing About"", which was made when Cagney was having one of his feuds with Jack Warner over his contract. That is a much better buy.",1211068800,4,963,5.694444444444445

2862810,3,B000R9CO94,"I gave this three stars more because Gary Cooper is included in it than anything, otherwise I think it is a useless piece of crap for a movie.  The plot is stupid and includes a lot of different celebrities of the time discussing about stolen ""jools.""  It is a part of my Gary Cooper collection and that is all.",1429833600,,311,4.254237288135593
