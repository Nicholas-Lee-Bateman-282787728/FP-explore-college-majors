Most of this movie was great; very suspenseful, good writing and really good acting by everyone involved. The late Andy Giffith did a superb job playing his part in light of how most of us remember him, as Sheriff Taylor.

But, the close of the film is as nutty as a squirrels breakfast. It's just not realalistic, at all. It leaves the viewer insulted and disappointed in such a lame conclusion. It's almost as though there were two writers on this film. Won't get specific because I don't want to spoil the movie for first tim viewers.
It'd give it more stars, but the ending of this film just destroys the whole preceeding minutes of suspense and good acting.

It's a shame.

With more takent in the writing department where the conclusion is concerned, this could have been a great movie.",1467676800,3,835,4.546666666666667
