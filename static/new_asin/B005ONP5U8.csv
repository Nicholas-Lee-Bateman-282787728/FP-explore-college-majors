8481598,4,B005ONP5U8,"James Mason, classy Brit, had his share of espionage intrigue on cinema, films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Met-in-the-Dark-VHS/dp/B00004CROO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Met in the Dark [VHS</a>] (1943),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-British-Classics-Candlelight-In-Algeria/dp/B004HWZDHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of British Classics: Candlelight In Algeria</a>&nbsp;(1944), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Between/dp/B006LLFXMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Between</a>&nbsp;(1954) [Amazon Instant Video]. Chalk up HOTEL RESERVE (1944) as another such. It's a bit of pre-war skullduggery from RKO Studios. It adapts Eric Ambler's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Epitaph-for-a-Spy/dp/0375713247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Epitaph for a Spy</a>. The narrative plays out in August, 1938. Mason plays  32-year-old Austrian refugee Peter Vadassy, him what's nearly completed his five-year residency in France and is anticipating his impending French citizenship and his new post as assistant house surgeon. Three more fun facts about M. Vadassy: currently he's a medical student; he teaches languages to pay for his medical school; he's an amateur photographer. That last bit propels the plot.

Peter Vadassy is holidaying in the south of France, lodged at Hotel Reserve. But when the French intelligence agency finds incriminating film in his camera, Peter, on threat of imprisonment followed by deportation, is coerced to investigate the ten guests at the hotel and ferret out the enemy agent lurking amongst them.

It's fascinating, if you're a fan of these old-timey motion pictures, seeing James Mason down the years. The early 1940's found him still in his gangly, rail-thin physique, not quite the stately, measured demeanor he would achieve in his later years. He's fidgety in this film, although that's probably an outward manifestation of his character's stress. Nevertheless, Mason is his usual suave self with the gentlemanly airs and the silky smooth diction. You can see why fellow hotel guest Mary Skelton (Clare Hamilton) would be smitten. By the way, a point of trivia: Clare Hamilton's real name was Florrie Fitzsimons and she was Maureen O'Hara's sister. This was her only film appearance. That's too bad. I thought she was a notable presence onscreen.

It's an interesting watch. It's not the whodunit aspect that fixates you. What pulls you in is watching James Mason at work as his character snoops around, a makeshift amateur sleuth who doesn't quite know what he's doing, trying like mad to keep his frayed nerves under control. Besides Mason himself, what struck me most about the film is that air of melancholia that subtly pervades the screen. It's a British film after all, shot in England, released in 1944, during the height of the world war, and the stakes had never been so high. The film, from jump, sets a moodiness and a sense of impending loss and of things in flux. No moment crystalizes this temperament, this sense of elegiac lament, more than the ending scene as the hotel's proprietor (Lucie Mannheim, also very good) gazes in the distance at a dallying couple and wistfully remarks: ""Let them be happy while they can... There's so little time.""",1415577600,,3410,6.218220338983051

8481601,4,B005ONP5U8,"One wonders what this movie would have become if Hitchcock had gotten his hands on it. Would he have revved up the plot, tightened up the script, recast some of the characters, put in a highway chase over the countryside interrupted by sheep, added a more appealing female interest for Mason? The climb up to the roof at the end, the strong lighting and direct closeups, the art and photographic direction(seemingly uncredited to one of the directors),as well as the music score and the general ""look"" of the film, not to mention James Mason's compelling presence all had the ingredients for a potential Hitchcockian thriller, but something is missing here. The plot's not that complicated (certainly not like ""The Lady Vanishes"") and there seems not to be enough risk or sense of danger (certainly not like ""The 39 Steps"")to Mason's life, although there is suspense and surprise along the way. One big weakness is the supporting cast. The young lady's character (can't even remember her name) isn't developed enough, nor does she have sufficient charm or sex appeal, as a Hitchcockian heroine would.

Still one watches it for Mason, before he has developed any overt mannerisms or been sadly type-cast as a villain. He seems to have made a number of these not-quite-up-to-snuff pictures in his career. Was he hard up? why didn't Hitchcock cast him and why didn't he ever accept a Powell & Pressburger offer? His presence on any number of these ""grade-b"" films, including the brief appearance in ""Madame Bovary"" (with Jenifer Jones), for example, or in the disappointing ""Mayerling,"" adds a sense of gravitas to any of the proceedings in which he appeared, but the scripts and directors fail him, if not the cast.

Fortunately, he can be remembered for his appearance as Captain Nemo in ""Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea,"" and Sir Randolph Nettleby in ""Shooting Party,"" both of which tapped his natural dignity and aristocratic bearing and surrounded him with a worthy cast. See those for Mason at his best.

Of four stars****, two and a half.",1276041600,2,2048,4.9476744186046515

Geoffreys plays the director, Updyke, of the resort for men only. He believes in spanking the guests to discipline them before becoming hotel employees. He gives these five men hell. Meanwhile, these men get to play football. The men have fun taking the mens uniform shorts down to stop them from making a pass or touchdown. Eventually, it becomes a football game in the nude. Updyke does not like this behavior at all. Also two guys fight over the warm shower and it ends up in a towel fight and nude wrestling match. Updyke has fun with his rubber duckies in the suana. The Bi-lingual man gets to work-out with weights in the gym a la naturel. Then the guys decide to go for a naked round of Marco Polo in the resort's swimming pool. Updyke is still keeping an eye on them. This time through binoculars. Time for the men to do some nude sunbathing. Updyke writes this down on his pad. The bi-lingual man feels like a prisoner so he tries to escape through the window, but Updyke captures him by pulling off his shorts, but that is how he got loose. Later that night, one of the men go for a moonlight swim. The next day, all the men play nude volleyball. Updyke hides in a tree still writing down the bad behavior. Now comes time for all the men to get disciplined. In the lobby, Updyke makes every man drop his shorts for a spanking. Isn't that kinky? Finally the five men find a way to get even with Updyke. Plenty of male nudity as comedy abounds.
 Filmed at an actual gay male resort that allows optional nudity.",1051401600,2,1960,5.282051282051282
