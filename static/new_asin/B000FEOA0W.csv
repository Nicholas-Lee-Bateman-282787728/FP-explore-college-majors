8121555,4,B000FEOA0W,"Despite being shot on digital video, these shorts feature artful compositions and editing. The acting and directing are not too shoddy either for such a grassroots production. More like old John Waters films, but with a more sophisticated edge. Pure wacky entertainment!!",1201478400,,271,5.476190476190476
8121556,1,B000FEOA0W,"I purchased this because I thought it was going to be a couple of short films that were dark comedies in the style of Todd Solondz.  I was very disappointed in the production quality and the overall product, itself.  The acting is horrible and the shorts appear to have been videotaped in a day in someone's apartment.  Do not waste your money on this.  I should have done more research before I wasted mine.",1198022400,,408,4.472972972972973
