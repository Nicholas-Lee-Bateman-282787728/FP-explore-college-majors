Instead of mostly focusing on Schenker's hands (which is what we'd prefer of any MSG film or video) we get nonstop jumpcuts. Back in those days (the early 80's) rock film/video directors thought it was ""cool"" & ""rock-n-roll"" to have a flashy & jumpy can't-sit-still-for-a-moment kind of presentation. But they were misguided. The result is sort of teenybopper-ish. It's silly. But, that aside, Schenker & Co. are right on the money. The playing is excellent. And that's the bottom line, ain't it?
