2300336,4,B0009MFQQM,"This is tough if you are only beginning.  I (like the first reviewer) used to exercise quite a lot, then for one reason or another, I stopped and now am trying to get back in the swing of it.  If you are either not fit or only very moderately fit, this will challenge you, however there is hope.  It does get easier the more you do it and I have to say it's well worth it.  It gets you sweating and gets your heart racing and that gets the weight off.  Challenge yourself and you'll be so happy and the rewards are great.",1126051200,39,521,4.019417475728155
2300337,5,B0009MFQQM,"I love the Bootcamp Series.  Some people may not prefer them because they are less cardio intensive than some of his other workouts.  However, in this workout, Billy gets your heartrate up and then you use the bands, which even though it doesn't feel like it, actually burns more calories because you have constant resistance with the bands.

I have been doing Billy's tapes for a long time. I am in very good shape and this workout really makes me work up a sweat. If you are a beginner and don't like high impact exercises then this is probably not for you.  Billy does alot of squats and pushups in this workout.

I also like this workout because it is an entire body workout. Besides working your arms and legs, there is on the floor stomach workout that is very intense.  However, as Billy says, ""You have to give some to get some"" and this workout definitely makes you work. Also, the Basic Training workout has some exercises that I have never seen Billy do, and believe me, I have done ALOT of different Billy workouts. Even though I am not a beginner, I put this DVD in my rotation of Billy workouts because I like the variation.  If you are a beginner and are in good shape, then I would recommend this workout.  You will definitely see results if you stick with it.",1125878400,20,1276,4.423076923076923
2300338,4,B0009MFQQM,"I have been sedentary for about 3 years now, and I used to be a moderately active person.  I used to work out a few times a week, and it was always a workout that got my heart pumping like MTV Grind (unlike Curves) or an hour and a half mountain bike ride.  I really allowed myself to get into a slump, and am over 100 lbs overweight right now.  It was really hard to get through this workout for the first time, but I did not give up.  I slowed down, and walked it out, but didn't give up.  The second time was easier, but it was still very difficult not to give up.  I had to force myself to keep going.  Blanks offers the kind of workout I have always used, the kind where you don't kid around.  You go for maximum results in this one, learn the moves, and then move on to the Ultimate DVD.  I have watched that also, and it is just like the Basic, only more circuit work, and less abs.  There is a separate Abs workout for that.  This is my first time doing a Blanks workout, and for some reason, I knew his workouts would be a challenge where you see instant results.  I can already see and feel a difference in my muscles, in my energy level, and in my psyche.  Now I just have to keep it up.  Some have said that Blanks goes too fast for a beginner, but that is what rewind is for.  If you keep doing it, you'll be happy that he didn't slow down because you'll be bored once you master it.  You will not be bored with this one because Blanks kicks your butt!!!  And for those of you who see that I'm 100lbs overweight and think it'll be a breeze for you, think again!  The people doing the routine with Billy are skinny and still sweat like crazy.  Good luck!!!",1125792000,21,1668,4.030487804878049
2300339,4,B0009MFQQM,"This is a great workout.  I do not have the bands that are used in the workout, but it is still a good workout without them.  If you have not worked out in a long time, this may be too strenuous.",1415750400,,195,3.731707317073171

And, the vids cost less now, since's he's no longer the newest/latest. And i like the basic nature of his moves: crunches, punches, kicks, twists, etc. No complex sequence of dance moves to remember.

2300352,4,B0009MFQQM,"I like this. At first, it was too hard. I couldn't get through the whole thing, but if if you just do the cadence in the hard parts, you will soon work up to speed. Each sections works a different part of the body, so you get a rest soon enough. When you are finished, you know your body got a good workout. You feel stronger, more relaxed, and accomplished. You will be sweating in no time. It's very satisfying.

The people who are doing the workout with Blanks are male and female. They are different body types so you never feel like you are working towards some unattainable ideal. You feel like you are part of a team. I have way too many workout DVDs that I don't use. I like this one and use it a lot.",1346025600,4,709,4.100719424460432
2300353,5,B0009MFQQM,The product provides a great workout.  I was pleasently surprised when the product arrived before mothers day when I thought it would not.,1339459200,,138,5.0
2300354,5,B0009MFQQM,"I read the reviews and then got this DVD. Great results right away. After the workout and shower, I feel like I did at 25 after 90 minutes of karate, though now ever so much older than 25. So I got six other Billy DVDs to mix it up and surprise the muscles. The Ab workout DVD is great, too. But this DVD has a fantastic ab workout as well.

Billy's workout efficiently mixes stretching, yoga, karate, dance, and boxing to hit every muscle and give a good cardiovascular workout.

It is a challenge to make it through the first three times. Beginners take it slow. Start with low kicks, so you don't hurt yourself. But make a commitment to let the entire 50 minutes run, if you finish all exercises or not. Use it every other day, just like in body building. Later you can alternate every day with the Ab workout, Cardio, or Flex workout.

I suggest disregarding Billy's orders to 'go left or right', or 'use your left or right hand'. I find it's better to mirror Billy's movements. I did that the second workout and could follow much better.

I use 3.5 pound wrist weights and found they work well, instead of using the bands for resistance. And keep water handy. If you want just one Billy DVD, than this is the one that you can start with and will really keep you in shape.",1331510400,10,1276,4.326359832635983
2300355,4,B0009MFQQM,"Billy Blanks does too much talking in all his workouts... and he can never keep up w/ the equality of reps... that said, once you learn where he messes up, you can count yourself and get it right! I gave this video 4 stars, b/c anything less than 500 calories for me is not my favorite... 450 calories in 50 minutes. As w/ his other videos in this series, I do not use the bands b/c there is only so much resistance I can take in my shoulders due to my job requiring me to have my arms raised ALL day long (dental hygienist) and I could not get through a day w/o pain if I went straight for the bands.",1327190400,2,601,3.975206611570248

2300357,2,B0009MFQQM,I love Taebo workout tapes but you have to pay close attention to the length of the tape. This tape is 55 minutes long with stretching and intros it's easily an hour long. I just don't have an hour to workout. Even if I did I get bored after a half an hour. He has some really good tapes that are only a half an hour and some that are less. I prefer the bootcamp cardio live and the and the ab bootcamp 2004 and 2005. There's also a 8 nminute which is really about 14 minutes. It is great and much more intense than the longer tapes. I sometimes do two of those a day.,1295654400,2,568,3.9051724137931036
2300358,4,B0009MFQQM,"Well, first of all, I'd have to say, if you are reading the title and equate ""Basic"" as meaning easy, you'll probably want to put this one back.  It's ""Basic Training"", a whole different ballgame.  Basic in this context is a core set of moves.  Now one thing I did not realize when I borrowed this from the library was that it used ""Billy Bands"".  These are two rubber tubing bands that are very slender that make the moves tougher causing more resistance for your muscles. My resistance band was not long enough or the same type so I could not use bands.  Instead, for the arm sections I picked up 3 lb weights and used those.  I have done Billy's workouts before and I knew due to the number of repetitions how much weight I would want to carry to exhaust the muscle but not to compromise my form.  This worked well for the upper arm portion.  Of course it didn't do anything for adding resistance to the kicks, but I find trying to use bands for kicks tend to get a little challenging for me to keep the tubing where it should be so, I may not have used them for that anyway.

The workout itself is good.  You do squats, pushups, overhead presses, jumping jacks, ""running"" in a plank position and Billy's usual brand of kicks and punches to add in a little more to your basic calisthenics workout. Before you get to the stretch at the end you do a killer ab segment.

Aside from the bands, it is what I expected and it worked me out pretty hard.  I'm a daily exerciser, I normally do a variety of different exercise from Jillian Michaels, Yoga, Salsa, Pilates, kickboxing and felt that this dvd would be in the intermediate category.

All and all a good workout-no surprise moves, if you have done basic training type videos before or Billy's workouts you have done the exercises and you know how to do the kicks that he does and the basic exercises.

I would say this would be good with the bands, without the bands, or like I did, with a little bit of extra free weights if you are more advanced and do not have bands-that will add a bit more to your upper body training.",1275782400,3,2076,4.31701030927835
2300359,5,B0009MFQQM,"In this DVD Billy Blanks' Tae Bo moves are combined with over all intense body workout  and elevated  to the next level by using the rubber band. This work out will build you up and prepare you for ""Ultimate boot camp"" and it is very effective if you alternate it with ""Ab boot camp"".  I had to order the other two DVDs once I tried this one.",1261872000,3,342,4.074626865671642
2300360,1,B0009MFQQM,"I got this DVD to get back in shape after a baby and I thought that I was in pretty good shape after doing Billy's older videos, but OMG!  Way too fast for ""Basic""!  My teenagers couldn't even keep up.  It's like it is in fast motion.  I wish that I could find more like his older videos on DVD.",1251936000,4,295,3.8666666666666667
2300361,5,B0009MFQQM,"This boot camp is real. I loved the challenge of the resistant bands. This is only the basic, ah!!! I identified with one of the girls in the room, she did the level one. We both we going out of breath,but Bill always came to her ""me"" and pushed to the limit. Great!!! My polar HR monitor indicated 133-158 average. I burned 370 cal in 50 min. The first 8 min are for stretch. Really nice. Do not quit. !!! Chicas, este video va a sacarles la leche. Se los recomiendo. Excellente quema 370 cal en  50min.

Billy Blanks is one of the best workout instructors I've ever seen. He is so motivating and instructive during this whole thing. The whole team of Billy Blanks are also very motivated and know exactly what they are doing. I promise you will never get bored with this workout. And this is just the beginning! I tell everyone I know to try Billy Blanks' Bootcamp. You also learn valuable defense mechanisms. You want to get into shape fast but still have fun doing it?

2300363,4,B0009MFQQM,"I really enjoyed this workout, but gave it 4 stars due to the inconsistency that Billy has in his videos.  For example, he does more reps on one side than the other, says we're only going to do 1 more rep and we end up doing 2 or 3 more, and is often off on his counting.  But, I think this one delivers results and using the bands makes it even better!  I recommend this one for those that like the old Tae Bo Advanced Workout, it is a lot of the same drills from that.",1239235200,5,470,3.875

2300365,5,B0009MFQQM,"I was always very thin and when I got pregnant with my daughter I ballooned.  I went from 130 to 220.  Now it took awhile to get use to my new body.  I started by changing the way I ate and TIMES I ate at.  I lost about 40 lbs that way.  Your still left with flab.  I bought this kit (basic, abs, ultimate, and bands).  I started it and almost had an asthma attack.  I enjoyed it though and decided to keep up with it the day after next.  Its been 3 wks and I have a stronger body, i've noticed my breathing is better and my waist is trimmer.  I am a size 12 and my pants are now big and sliding off my hips.  It's ONLY been 3 wks. After the initial 2 workouts you feel great.  I recommend this Ladies and Gents.  Like I said I went from 130 to 220.  My body is more toned and I feel like i have so much energy!

2300366,5,B0009MFQQM,"And i didn't before. I hated the original tae-bo, all the yelling and the ""do it! do it!"" and all these skinny people i could never be. Well I don't know what happened, but Billy's Bootcamp Basic Training is wonderful. He takes the time to break down why an exercise might not be working and when i made the corrections i felt this sudden surge of energy! I felt it working. He's much more relaxed and helpful and keeps saying some very encouraging things. The yelling is by the ""helpers"" in the back and they encourage you to yell which does actually help!
My muscles and twitching with strength and enjoyment and all i want to do is do it again and again. You sweat and you yell and you come out better for it. Yes yes yes, buy this product.",1233014400,6,743,4.276595744680851
2300367,5,B0009MFQQM,"I'm advanced as far as exercising goes.  I felt I needed a challenge, so after reading some of the reviews I purchased this DVD and a couple of others including the bands.  The workout is everything it promises!  The first day I did not use the bands, and I was kind of disappointed because after reading that this workout beats the heck out of you, I began to wonder about the fitness levels of my fellow reviewers.  Well, day two I used the bands and OMG!!!!!...talk about cardio/resistence/abs and all over body abuse!!! LOL  It was great, despite the fact that I was quite sore the next day.  I have stuck with it each day this week and I have to admit, I am NOT disappointed.  A few of the reviews complain about the production and the ""screaming"" in the background.  First of all, Billy Blanks is obviously there to kick your butt, not to provide a cutesy video; he comes through.  And as for screaming in the background - its very minimal; mostly counting and this comes from his daughter who obviously helps him out with keeping the others on track. - this is easy to ignore if you're interested in a serious workout and not a career as a movie production critic.  I highly recommend it - I've felt the benefits from day 2...I will continue this workout since its an all-in-one.  I don't have to do seperate weights, treadmill or going out to run; especially now that it becomes dark so early and the cold is kicking in. I can reap the benefits of all the above and thensome in one workout.  Enjoy!",1224201600,8,1506,4.416666666666667

There is a nice selection of various movements that kept me going and interested and I am ablle to get further along than I did when I first started where I had to pause for a break, which is good since I will be able to use this for awhile.

This aand his Ab DVD are a great combination for the DVD library.",1223769600,2,554,3.919642857142857

I find I get an even harder workout following this dvd than I do with 30 min cardio and 30 min weight training at my gym. Billy really knows how to make you sweat!

2300370,4,B0009MFQQM,"This video is tough. He mixes in many different moves into one hour, so its very intense. I only used the bands once and after that I simply continued without them. With that said and probably doing the video like 3 times in one week I did notice some results. I felt tightened and I felt sleek. It was a good feeling. The beginning of the workout had to many squats and there were little recovery time from one different exercise to squats. Overall this is a good video. Comparing it to other videos Billy lacks in the stretching department especially in the end of the workout. I was taught dynamic stretch should be performed in the beginning and static stretching in the end. Billy did static stretches in the beginning which wasn't too bad, but in the end there were hardly enough stretching to compensate for such an intense hour",1212883200,4,835,4.5364238410596025

I like the volume of the music, it is loud enough to set a tone.  I like seeing the class's enthusiasm.  You don't have to have the Billy Bands to do the exercises and there is one person on there that doesn't use them.  If you follow the instructions, you will still feel a burn.

2300375,5,B0009MFQQM,"Folks! This workout is no joke. I thought I could get through basic training without stopping. Well, I could not even get through first 20 minutes and had to stop because the burn in the muscles was just unbearable. This is a very thorough workout. Here's what to expect.

First of all, this workout builds endurance. If you reach a point where you get through the entire workout without interruptions then you are guaranteed to obtain an endurance of an athlete. I liked the bands, but they are usefull only for the upper body exercises. When Billy Blanks began the legs routine, the bands were just on my way and frankly did not add any resistance to the kicks. So feel free to stop using the bands once you begin the kicks. And please do not even try to get through the entire DVD if you are a beginner or only somewhat in shape. What good would it be if you have sore muscles and cannot even feel it because you died during that push-up routine? Take breaks and slowly build your endurance. Maybe after about a month you can try to be a hero and actually complete this workout and still be able to walk to a shower rather than have someone else get you there.",1167868800,64,1163,4.359447004608295

It was so much more challenging then it looked when I watched it through.  I used to think that my shoulders were one of my strongest body parts, but I was really struggling because those bands make such a difference.  Even though I was sore, I asked my husband to buy the set for Christmas and am loving the videos.",1138752000,10,607,4.084745762711864

Let me tell you, the bands make a HUGE difference!  I got an excellent workout and am sure I'll be super sore tomorrow.  And this is just the BASIC dvd.  I can't imagine what his more advanced Bootcamp workouts are like.

Needed more as I got in a plateau and/or bored. I'm 42 and now still 24 lbs overweight.  I had no idea until I did this basic bootcamp, how NOT in shape I was LOL. At first it was challenging.  I took some breaks, hitting pause,when they kept going. (They're more in shape so allow yourself the break!) You'll need lots of water, preferably with ice and leave the air conditioner or fan on lol! I sweat like dripping sweat! Listen to his instructions & get it right before moving on. Or its pointless.  There's one part where they go real fast moving side to side w kicks and jabs. I'm in an apt so I had to kinda just keep moving in place. Don't feel bad if u have to, just keep your body moving in place. The one ab exercise I can't do. I can't seem to do it right without making my back & neck hurt.  Don't do anything u tried a few times that u feel is harming u! Maybe my abs just aren't strong enough yet. Time will tell. In just 3 bootcamp workouts in full, I've noticed shape in my arms, abs, waist, and over all more strength and energy.  Just do what u can and you'll be a pro! If I can just about anyone can! I'll soon be getting his bootcamp #2! Sometimes it was hard getting started,  but half way thru& after I'm always glad I did it! As the results show after! U will bust fat&tone quickly if on a healthy diet. You WILL be sore after the first day. I took lots of aleve LOL. Second time not much!  I will say the stretches made a difference when I focused more on them rather than worrying about getting to the next parts and just getting it over with. So pay attn to him, take your time, take breaks (not too long!) and you'll get there like I did. I feel AMAZING!!! Highly recommend!",1441065600,4,1844,4.131284916201118
8063168,5,B0009MFQQM,"Good grief, if I can't get myself into shape with this DVD in my routine I deserve to be labeled unfit. Killer. Very motivated by Billy Blanks and his crowd of exercise junkies. I want to be like them. Haven't gotten through this one yet, but I love it so far. Awesome stuff.",1422057600,,275,4.2075471698113205
