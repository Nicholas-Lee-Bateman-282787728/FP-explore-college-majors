8570876,5,B008CUYQLO,"A touching look at what people go through who experience miscarriage and abortion. Both men and women will find something to relate to in this film, as both perspectives are examined. You will gain insight into how to help others if you have not experienced this type of loss yourself.  This difficult subject matter is handled very delicately. A powerful resource for the church, as well as individuals. The opening story of a miraculous survival birth would be enough reason alone to watch the film, but there is so much more. It's worth your time!",1491436800,,550,4.7894736842105265

8570880,5,B008CUYQLO,"I have not experienced a miscarriage or an abortion so I really didn't understand what people go thru when they have these experiences.  This movie showed me what those experiences are like both for the woman and the man and the depth of the pain that they go thru.  It also gave very practical ideas on how to support others who are going thru this; what to do, what not to do.  It was so amazingly touching and real and I loved the dramatized portions - really brought the stories to life.  I feel this is an extremely important movie to see for all of us, whether we've gone thru these experiences ourselves or not.",1349049600,2,618,4.3478260869565215
8570881,5,B008CUYQLO,I really enjoyed watching this with my wife. It stimulated some profound conversation and engagement. I still don't know how they were able to navigate such a delicate issue but it was brilliant nonetheless.,1348012800,,207,5.117647058823529
8570882,5,B008CUYQLO,"Absolutely amazing! A much see for those who have experienced some type of loss of a child, elective or not! Would recommend to view at a youth group, support group, church group!",1347062400,,179,4.625
8570883,5,B008CUYQLO,If you meet someone who has had a miscarriage or abortion they will not likely tell you about it.  I had no idea how common loss from miscarriage or abortion is before watching Aborted Sun.  This film explores the thoughts and feelings of some who have gone through the loss of elective and spontaneous abortions.  I have never gone through the pain of such an experience but at least now I understand a little more those who have.,1346284800,,431,4.5
8570884,5,B008CUYQLO,"This film gives a panoramic view of the other side of the curtain where people usually don't dear to walk to... it shows how most of the time people, even in church, pretend these parents are not going through a difficult situations just to avoid the uncomfortable moment of a conversation.

Infant loss, in any case, is a sad memory for these mothers and fathers who are usually denied the title.  Like one of the fathers said (I am paraphrasing), the moment you are expecting you become a parent....

Powerful! For sure churches will benefit from having this powerful resource available.",1346198400,,589,4.811881188118812
