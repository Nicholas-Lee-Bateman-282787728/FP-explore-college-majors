383097,5,6301961412,"I can seriously relate to the characters in the mission. My grandfather was a tailgunner during WWII. Once he was sick and unable to go on a mission. His entire crew and plane were destroyed on take-off. And where would I be? Out of existance. Steven Spielberg directs the first in a series of Amazing stories, a story about heart and survival. Kevin Costner is the captain of a crew of airmen in WWII. The Bellygunner dreams one day of drawing for Disney, and hopes as soon as the war is over, to work in the land of magic.
 Kiefer Sutherland, a more serious character and close companion, always keeps an eye out and protects his friend nomatter the cost. On one mission in flight over enemy lands, the plane is hit my enemy fire. The good news is they can make it back to base. But the tragedy is, the door to the bellygunner is stuck and the landing wheels are jammed. Sutherland has a tremendous decision to make, and is faced with a hard decision of his life.
 In a tension mounting climax, you see how the dreams and ambitions of one man can change the lives of the others around him forever. Absolutely great.
The other story, The Ring, is funny as all get out. If the decision had been left to me, I wouldn't have stuck these two stories together because they are so different. I would wait a half an hour between the two so you can get the most out of them. Devito and Pearlman have a hard lesson to learn about love, and what it takes to rekindle it. Good stuff.",993513600,10,1473,4.294964028776978
383098,5,6301961412,"BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT, just for the short, ""Family Dog"" I have been looking for this cartoon for years!!  I knew of someone's household that was similar to this short!  My family and I used to watch this everytime it came on cable, before the series came out.",986860800,7,258,4.14
383099,5,6301961412,"It was probably ""Amazing Stories"" schizophrenic nature - amusing family-oriented fare coupled with more mature offerings - that led to the show only lasting one season.  An example of the latter is ""Mirror, Mirror,"" a scary story about a Stephen King-like author ""stalked"" by a mystery figure similar to one of the characters of his novels.  Only the author, well-played by a pre-""Law & Order"" Sam Waterson can see the spectre until the story's final few seconds.  If the show had stuck to one genre, say of the horror/thriller vein, then it may have had a longer run. This reviewed story is, undeniably, one of the program's best.
The second installment in this tape benefits by being paired with this one.",981158400,,707,4.8264462809917354
383100,5,6301961412,"The Family Dog is absolutely the funniest cartoon I have ever seen. We wore out our copy years ago, and I'm so grateful to find that it's here for sale. Although we haven't seen it for eons, my family still quotes from it,  and we never fail to crack up in giggles at even the memory! I can't speak  for the Christopher Lloyd portion, but Family Dog is WELL worth the  investment, for the youngsters as well as the adults in the family!",952300800,5,436,4.228915662650603
383101,4,6301961412,"The first episode, ""The Mission"", is a very enetertaining tale that anybody under the age of 20 would enjoy. I consists of fighting in WW2 and of the lives of B-17 pilots. It is a miniature ""Memphis  belle"" yet is in its own class. A B-17 has many gun turrets on it, and  one is located on the bottom of the plane. In this episode of Amazing  stories, the belly gunner's bubble is damaged, and he cannot get out. To  make matters worse, the bombers landing gear will not go down, so the crew  has to risk a belly landing, which would spell the end of our  cartoon-drawing, luftwaffae-fighting, and caring hero, Kevin Costner. The  ending is surprising, and has a bit of magic to it. This is, of course, my  opinion. And the music by John Williams! WOW! amazing, to say the least.  Especially when the AS theme surges as the gunner frantically creates his  solution to the problem. If you wanna know how it ends, scroll down as far  as you can go
The gunner, being a cartoonist, frantically draws his  airplane, while John Williams them races and flares. He draws his plane,  and adds a pair of balloony, cartoon tires to the landing gear, which  results in an impressive bending of animation and live action, for the  time. And thus, the B-17 lands safely, and the gunner is united with his  lady, and the crew lives happily ever after.",943401600,5,1336,4.458677685950414
383102,5,6301961412,"We saw the Family Dog section when it was on tv. We taped it off onto video, and wore the thing out!!! All four of my kids knew every word by heart, and a lot of times, would repeat the dialog, even without the movie.  I finally found it on video, and bought all four of my kids a copy, and now  I need a copy, too. My grandkids love it as much as my kids do. Even though  we have seen this movie hundreds of times, it has never lost any of its'  appeal. The Christopher Lloyd piece is also quite funny, but The Family Dog  is the BEST!",928886400,2,536,3.8363636363636364
383210,5,6301961412,"Best episodes are on this VHS.  It is becoming very rare and hard to find becuae the DVD series came out.  The bonus to buying this VHS tape is that it has a story called, ""The Wedding Ring"" (see VHS cover)which is not on the DVD or any other tape at this time.  It is a great story with Danny Devito and his wife (the short currly haired waitress from ""Cheers"" - not Diane) and they go a great job of spinning a great yarn.  This is worth the money if you can still find it and if you still have a VHS player to see it on.  Who knows when and if the DVD version will ever come out with BOTH of these stories, right now you can only get the frist of the two on DVD.  Great stuff, take a look!

383211,5,6301961412,"One of the stories in this epsisode of Amazing Stories is 'Blue Man Down'.  It stars Max Gail, who played Wojo on the Barney Miller TV series. I first saw it when it was playing in prime-time.  It's an excellent story and has just a touch of paranormal to it.  The female lead is also very good and one of the reasons I searched out this episode.",1197590400,,346,4.134328358208955
383212,5,6301961412,"Maybe someone can explain why this truely Amazing anthology is not on DVD.  Given the glut of tv series that have been released, that ""Amazing Stories"" remains locked away is criminal.  [Oddly enough, the most interesting (if short lived) tv series ever made - Level 9, First Wave, Special Unit 2, Dark Skies, Prey, Swift Justice, Strange Luck - remain in blackout.  Heck, Firefly, the Lone Gunmen, and Crusade made it to DVD and they lasted no longer than a number of these equally well made shows.]  It's just a shame.",1139616000,2,520,4.681318681318682
383213,4,6301961412,"The first half of this is a less than memorable Christopher Lloyd episode of Amazing Stories, which says a lot about the writing since Christopher Lloyd could make a piece of toast funny. The second half of this is the Family Dog, which is not only memorable, but classic and under appreciated. This animated half hour has excellent writing, animation, and voice talent - including Annie Potts as the mother. The hilarity of home life is in your face and leaves you wanting more. My sisters, brother, even my mother quoted it for years after seeing it, ""Oh my gawd they've taken the coffee maker!"" My family was very grateful when years after seeing it, I bought each of them a copy through Amazon. They love it and watch it over and over- and what makes a classic of something beyond the audiences love of returning to the material? Even though the eventual animated series it spawned lacked the same writing punch, I would highly recommend this to anyone with a love of good clean ""art imitating family life"" humor.",1135728000,6,1017,4.655555555555556
383214,5,6301961412,"We first watched it about 18 years ago and it's brilliant, a real gem. We watch it every couple of years now and enjoy just as much. The VHS tape (which was a copy) is almost unwatchable... would love to get the DVD.

383216,4,6301961412,The cartoon was unbelievably funny! That rotten little boy and the smartass dog was too too funny for words.

383217,5,6301961412,"I remember watching this Amazing Stories premiere and being
rendered slackjawed for the entire episode.  I can remember no
better television, ever.  It was like watching 'Raiders of the
Lost Ark', '1941', and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' all
wrapped up in an hour of tension.  This is a masterpiece worthy
of film.
...and the DeVito episode is pretty good too.
