It makes me want to reconsider having my own kids. Don't  listen to the ones that totally bash this movie,it's awesome! However, if  you get scared easily, have a weak stomach,or a weak heart for that matter,  I wouldn't recommend that you watch this movie. For those of you that like  to have the sh** scared out of you, this movie is the one for you!!!",937353600,14,518,4.364583333333333

55738,5,0783230427,"This remake of the classic movie is first rate.  The acting by Christopher Reeve and Mark Hammil:  Exceptional.  Kristie Alley as the chain smoking government scientist is a fitting role.  She comes across as cold and very business first, which is not much of a stretch for her.  John Carpenter directed and he can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  The setting of the film is on the coast of California rather then in a small English town.  I thought the story of the alien s could have been better explored.  The original was made before we had the scientific advances we now have, so I think those advancement s should have been explored.  Great movie.  Excellent cast, setting, and director.  5 stars.  I was glad Michael Pare was killed off right away.",1461888000,,760,4.548148148148148

55740,3,0783230427,"John Carpenters Village of the Damned Collectors Edition gets an HD upgrade from our good friends at Scream Factory. John Carpenter directed the movie from a screenplay by David Himmelstein, Steven Siebert, and Larry Sulkis. The original script for the 1960 film was written by Stirling Silliphant, Wolf Rilla, and Ronald Kinnoch based on the novel by John Wyndham. The cast is made up of Christopher Reeve in his last performance before being paralyzed, Kirstie Alley, Mark Hamill, Linda Kozlowski, and Michael Pare.

Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birth... and the reign of supernatural terror begins. The people of Midwich must try to find a way to stop the unstoppable in the ""Village of the Damned.""

Village of the Damned doesnt have that John Carpenter quality weve come to expect from the directors more personal projects. The passion we see in his remake of The Thing from Another World is all but absent here. I don't get a sense of emotional attachment to the source material like I do for Howard Hawks original 1951film. Maybe thats because Ive read and seen interviews with Carpenter and his production partner where they admitted they were less than enthused to take on the movie and had ulterior motives.

Since ""Village of the Damned"" was made before the CGI craze hit Hollywood, we get a lot of practical and traditional special effects. Director Carpenter features not just one, but two burned and charred bodies for horror enthusiasts to enjoy. The visual effects of the children's eyes are also a treat to look upon.

John Carpenter shares the responsibility of the musical score for Village of the Damned with The Kinks singer, songwriter and guitarist Dave Davies. The combination of these two talents makes for an eclectic soundtrack. Lets just say its not quite as menacing as what weve come to expect when sitting down to watch Carpenters productions.

Village of the Damned Collectors Edition is rated R for some sci-fi terror and violence. Its rather tame by todays standards. It also contains gore, profanity, and frightening and intense scenes. If released today, the movie would be rated PG-13.

Scream Factory provides us with new special features for their Blu-ray release of Village of the Damned. It Takes a Village: The Making of Village of the Damnedcontains interviews with Director John Carpenter, Producer Sandy King, Actors Michael Pare, Peter Jason, Meredith Salenger, Cody Dorkin, Karen Kahn, Lindsey Haun, Danielle Wiener, Thomas Dekker, and Makeup Effects Artist Greg Nicotero. We get to return to the Village with Horrors Hallowed Grounds - Revisiting the Locations of the Film.

Producer / Actor Peter Jason opens up in The Go To Guy: My Career with John Carpenter. Vintage interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, a theatrical trailer, and a behind-the-scenes still gallery are found as well.

John Carpenter's ""Village of the Damned"" isn't necessarily a bad movie. It just feels like the iconic director was going through the motions. Almost like he really didn't have any personal stakes in creating something that would stand the test of time like his own ""Halloween"" or ""The Fog."" The acting isn't really bad and there are some chilling moments, but I couldn't shake the idea that I was being walked through an updated Reader's Digest condensed version of the original 1960 British film.

Village of the Damned Collectors Edition is available now on Blu-ray.",1460937600,2,3698,5.129568106312292
55741,5,0783230427,"Classic John carpenter is Village of the Damned which is a remake of the 1960 version of the same name
first time i saw this film i thought one of a Good suspense thriller no Doubt about it
and it's still Hell of a Good thriller to watch, very well Acted by Christopher reeve & Kirstie Alley

this new Blu-ray reissue courtesy of scream factory is excellent actually
SF have made lots of effort giving the film a new HD transfer in 2:35:1 ratio
the picture quality is definitely 10 times better than the very old dvd version, very nice colour restoration sharp & clear picture
hardly no Grain or Dirt
Definitely an upgrade from the old dvd version
plus the sound quality has been boosted aswell with a new 5.1 master audio mix & the usual 2.0 stereo mix
the 5.1 master sounds fantastic thru my sound system, the stereo mix sucks
about the new special features, well SF have done it again giving new extras for the fans over 2hrs worth of new extras
the original owner of the film Universal wouldn't bothered getting extras
a new 49mins retrospect Documentary IT TAKES A VILLAGE, very indepth Doco aswell worth watching for sure

this is the one and only John carpenter blu-ray reissue where John declined to do an Audio commentary
SF did ask him about doing an commentary for this film, bud he declined this time

5 stars for this new blu-ray based on new 1080p HD transfer & bit over 2 hours worth of extras",1460678400,8,2348,4.540094339622642
55742,3,0783230427,"John Carpenter's remake of ""Village of The Damned"" doesn't quite measure up to the original film (where the heck is THAT on Blu-ray) nor the novel its based on but it also isn't as bad as its reputation. There are touches of Carpenter's characteristic style but it probably the least like Carpenter's work in terms of script content as it was already written.

Carpenter was talent for hire for this project. Originally slated to be directed by the late Wes Craven, Carpenter stepped in to direct it because there was a film owed to Universal under his contract and he hoped that by doing the film (which Universal was excited about) they might greenlight his doomed remake of the ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"".

SPOILERS:

In the small town of Midwich everyone suddenly blacks out. Weeks later all the women of child bearing age find that they are pregnant. As the children grow, aside from their white hair and curiously lack of emotion, they all have the telepathic abilities among many other attributes. These albino kids (OK, they aren't albino but they all have white hair and are extremely pale) threaten both the town and the future of humanity. How were they created and who is their master?

END OF SPOILERS:

While the film doesn't quite catch fire the same way that the film that came out just before it (""In The Mouth of Madness""), it has some fine moments making it a worth film to catch. There are some flaws with the film--Kirstie Alley is horribly miscast as the scientist that is studying the children of Midwich and her performance falls flat. Amazingly, the kids give terrific performances (some of them went on to become full time actors as adults) and the late Christopher Reeve leads the adult actors and gives the best performance in the film a passionate one that raises the bar (although Mark Hammill is badly used in a largely minor role).

At 99 minutes the film should breeze by but, unusual for Carpenter, the languid pacing proves to be a problem for the film causing some of the tension to evaporate although the conclusion of the film holds up quite well. The score written by Carpenter with Kinks guitarist Dave Davies (Carpenter composed all of the sythesizer pieces while Davies wrote the guitar piece for the scenes where we first see the town of Midwich after the mass pregnancies.

As with all of Carpenter's films there are some pretty cool visual effects at the conclusion of the film.

This is obviously an older transfer. Grain is mostly eliminated here and the transfer also has some issues with edge enhancement. Color's pop and detail is improved over the previously released DVD. The bit rate is lower here than the overseas version that uses the same transfer (from Koch if I recall correctly). It is still a big upgrade from what came before but it isn't as good as their best work.

 Shout Factory also brings us a number of terrific special features. The only disappointment for me is the fact that there isn't a commentary track from Carpenter (who usually does some very good commentaries--he's best when he's pared with an actor or his DP).

We get a featurette  ""It Takes A Village: The Making of Village of The Damned"" on the background of the film featuring interviews with Carpenter,  producer Sandy King and a number of actors that worked on the project. We also get ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"" where the locations for the film are revisited 21 years later. ""The Go To Guy: My Career With John Carpenter"" featuring Peter Jason, a stills gallery and theatrical trailer as well as vintage interviews and behind-the-scenes footage.

""Village of The Damned"" may not be a perfect film but it remains entertaining. The transfer improves on what came before but it isn't a state of the art transfer.",1460505600,4,3754,4.7553846153846155
55743,4,0783230427,Still good. Nice to have it on dvd. For years I could  not remember the name of this movie. It is striking to see Christopher Reeves before his horrific experience. And then there is seeing Kirstie Alley.,1460505600,,204,4.513513513513513
55744,1,0783230427,This is a horrible remake that lacks the intelligence and sophistication of the original movie.  The source novel leaves you with a lot to ponder. This version leaves you with a feeling of time wasted and wooden acting from Kirstie Alley etc all.,1460073600,,246,4.72093023255814
55745,3,0783230427,"....but not his worst either (that would be The Ward). This is a remake of the 1960 movie which itself was based on a book. Ive seen both version but I do prefer this one over the original. Sadly this was also Christopher Reeve's last film role before his unfortunate accident. Basic plot is something weird happens in a small town & mysteriously some of the towns woman become pregnant. The resulting children however aren't exactly normal & soon it become clear what they are & what their agenda is. Reeve did a good job here, as well as the rest of the cast but especially the children. They were just really creepy in certain scenes. There isn't a lot of blood & gore here, except maybe one scene towards the end but whats here is effective & not bad looking. Music isn't bad either. Scream Factory have done another good job here as the movie looks really good & has some nice extras. Special features include interviews, making of, trailer, gallery & a feature taking you to the real locations where the film was shot. If you are a Carpenter fan then this is a must own, while far from his best its still not a bad horror film at all.",1460073600,4,1140,4.382075471698113
55746,2,0783230427,TERRIBLE COMPARED TO MGM'S 1960'S ORIGINAL. WISH THAT WOULD COME OUT ON BLU RAY ALONG WITH CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED,1459555200,,113,4.7
55747,2,0783230427,"There's something dopey in almost every scene, including a shot of the Midwich villagers assembled into an angry mob, complete with flaming torches.

It makes me think someone didn't know that ""torches"" is a British word for flashlights.

The dialogue for the alien children is awkward, and the wigs are terrible.

Lots of things don't really make sense.

Why knock everybody out during the daytime instead of doing it at night when most people are already lying down?

You risk killing some of your potential mothers if they happen to be driving.

Why knock the men out at all?

How did outsiders know that something was wrong in Midwich *before* anyone woke up to tell them about it?

(It might make sense if they were unconscious for days and days, but it seems like they were out for only a few hours.)

Why does one of the children have a more human-like mind than the others, and why does one look completely alien?

There's no explanation. It's just the writer's whim.

Also the title is bad because it makes the movie sound supernatural when it isn't.

(I don't like the book's title either. ""The Midwich Cuckoos"" sounds silly, and the metaphor doesn't hold up well because cuckoos don't kill their parents. Instead they kill other children, which is the approach taken by ""The Godsend"" and ""Orphan"".)

The government stupidly bombs the town even though the kids have already moved to a barn outside the city limits. Worse, we don't get to see it.

The airstrike is never shown.

I was also disappointed that these kids with the ability to control adults' bodies never use it to do anything besides hurt people (usually killing them).

The kids don't seem to have any goals or interests. They just walk around killing people who have hurt them or seem like a threat. They do nothing else.

Also, the self-defense aspect of some of the killings somewhat contradicts the movie's premise that the children are evil.

Overall, there isn't much to like. There were some interesting ideas, and it was nice to see Christopher Reeve walking and healthy, but that's about it.",1457654400,,2074,4.745810055865922

The children didn't really get a lot of air time, and with the exception of David, were not as likable as the 1960s version.  I did, though, like the additional plotline that one of the children had been stillborn, and that was why David was able to feel human emotions unlike the others.

Linda Kozlowski from ""Crocodile Dundee"" acted circles around her! Now that's saying something. And Mark Hamill? Basically acted like he was at a booth at a sci-fi convention. He just did nothing. There were some good effects, and the ending was effective, but I expected so much more. This has got to be Carpenter's low point. Michael Par was so/so. Big surprise!

55829,3,0783230427,The movie's okay. I loved the original when I saw it years ago. This version doesn't really expand on the old one it merely adds a few more scenes and reverses the leadership roles of one of the key kids.,1383868800,,204,4.125
55830,4,0783230427,"First I want to say that I did see the original. I saw that DVD at a convenience store in the cheap DVD section. It looked like something I would enjoy watching so I bought it. I watched it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I learned that there was a remake of this movie I had to see it.

The remake in it's own way is good. I did enjoy watching it. I won't mention the plot or storyline here. Others have already done that. So what I will do is compare the original and the remake.

For the most part the original and the remake are very similar, but there are some differences. In the remake we know how many children are born which was not so clear in the original. Also in the remake the children pair off-boy/girl. That is with the exception of one of the children-David. The one that was to be his partner was stillborn. That was the official report but there are a couple scenes that cause me to think otherwise. With that David would feel the loss and does develop emotions and feelings. This was not so in the original. There was a scene in the remake where David would walk away from the other children to visit a cemetery. There he would meet up with one of the other characters whose wife was killed by one of the other children. There they would share their experiences with losing someone dear. Also in the original all the children would be killed where in the remake David would be spared. In many ways he was not like the other children. The movie would end with David and his mother leaving town and David looking off in the distance.

I will mention two similarities with the original and remake. It is never determined who or what was responsible for bringing the children into the world. I suppose it's assumed that an alien race is responsible. Also it is never determined why they were born or what their purpose or mission was. One can assume that it was to create a superior race on earth.

This is a good movie but the original is better. I will give it four stars.

Once again Amazon did it's usual good job of getting the item to me in a timely manner. I used the cost free Super Saver shipping and had the item to me in a timely manner. Good job.",1383436800,,2180,4.256038647342995
55831,3,0783230427,"Village of the Damned is one of those films that has everything going for it but does not quite live up to its potential.  It is definitely not one of John Carpenters stronger films.  The film is not bad because there are definitely many good points to it, but also quite a few not so good points.  This film has a great premise.  The cast was great and the effects were pretty decent.  I will say the beginning and the ending are both great and suspenseful.  However, the middle portion is the factor that really brings the film down.

The movie stars the late Christopher Reeve as Dr. Alan Chaffee, Kirstie Alley as Dr. Susan Verner, and Mark Hamill in a small role as the village priest.  The story is as follows.  One day, in a small village called Midwich everyone suddenly collapses.  They wake up not knowing what happened.  A couple days later it is revealed that all of the village women have become pregnant at once.  The babies grow at an exponential rate.  They discover that the babies are of extraterrestrial origin.  Even the government gets involves to uncover this mystery.  The babies are born and grow very quickly in a few weeks or months.  These children all have white hair, little personality, and have the ability to ready and control peoples minds.  Eventually they mind control people to have them commit suicide.  Now it is up to Christopher Reeve to stop them.

Again the film starts out great where you have the whole village suddenly losing consciousness.  They, along, with the audience, are trying to figure what could have caused that.  Then you have every woman in the village getting pregnant.  This is all really interesting.  What could have caused this, and what is their intention?  Then at the end you have a fun sequence where the military comes in to deal with the children.  The children then take control of all of their minds and force them to kill each other.  That was a very fun scene with great production value.  There are even some decent kills during the middle.

However, the middle portion I found to be very boring and lackluster.  Most of the middle is focused on the children, how different and inhuman they are, and the village and government debating on what to do with them.  There was barely and horror, tension, action, or anything like that.  I just did not care and found myself almost falling asleep.  Mark Hamills character gets killed off in a stupid way during the middle as well, which annoyed me.  I am a fan of Mark Hamill, so I did not like him being killed off so early.  There are some decent kills by the children here and there, but not enough for me.

Also we never find out what these children really are, where they came from, and why they are doing this.  We know that they hate humans, but we do not know why.  All the questions that I had during the beginning of the film were never addressed.  This is why I do not think this movie quite lived up to its potential.

Overall, Village of the Damned is not bad, but was a bit disappointing.  If you are a fan of John Carpenter and his other works then give this a look.  Just do not expect something on the level of Halloween, The Thing, The Fog, etc.",1383091200,,3181,4.47212543554007

The film is about a group of extraterrestrial children being born as humans in a small town (who are seemingly identical to us in almost every way except their paranormal powers). 1960-1979 saw a period of horror films focusing on children that were chillingly effective (The Omen, The Exorcist, The Brood).

55849,3,0783230427,"Based on THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS by John Wyndham, THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED was originally filmed in 1960 and was widely admired by critics and public alike.  This 1995 update is less effective, mainly because there is such an obvious difference between how the scientific community would possibly react in 1960 and how it would realistically react in 1995.  Director John Carpenter and his writers do try to get around this--but they rely largely on the suspension of disbelief.

Although the 1960 Midwich was in England and the 1995 Midwich is in California, the stories are much the same.  A small town is going about its everyday business when quite suddenly everyone goes to sleep, dropping where they stand.  When they awake several hours later they continue with their lives, puzzled but none the worse for wear (except for the guy who fell asleep on the outdoor grill, of course.)  Then ten local women discover they are pregnant.  Some of the pregancies are impossible--one woman states she is a virgin--and when the babies are delivered they are blond with blue eyes and they behave in a most peculiar manner.  If you hurt one of them, they glare ... their eyes transform ... and they bend you to their evil will.

The cast is really very ho-hum.  Christopher Reed is okay; Kirstie Alley is slightly improbable; Mark Hamil is unfortunate.  The acting applause really belong to the supporting cast, led by Linda Kozlowski.  Although not remarkable, the special effects are entertaining, and the whole thing goes off at a good clip.  The 1995 remake isn't going to best the original, but it's an enjoyable B flick, good enough for a rainy night.

I am a HUGE Carpenter fan and whenever I see this remake I wonder what the hell went wrong. The direction is listless, story points that should be subtle are broadcasted, the acting is wooden, and the screenplay reads like something written by a 12 year old from his dad's notes. This seems like the kind of film a pissed off and contractually-obligated director would turn in to the studio - something that might seem ok when viewed in the dailies but when cobbled together is utter, abysmal garbage. But it does entertain - oh yes, in a Mystery Science Theater sweet-baby-Jesus-that-was-bad kind of way. If you want to see a real gem, see the original.

This remake can stand on its own feet as an interesting and worthwhile effort though it lacks the edge of horror which would have made it a superior offering. Still, the story itself is effective and while there is too much dilution of the sense of impending doom, it still has its taut moments. What I guess I am groping to say is that there is too much ordinary in it (like most of what the role played by Kirstie Alley has to do and a shoot-out scene among the police and troops) which diminishes the special atmosphere the film ought to have had.
In sum, being brief, it is a good minor film, gives a fair idea of what the intentions of the original film and script tried for, is watchable, but is not the quite the thriller it might have been.",1372896000,,967,4.2896174863387975

55856,5,0783230427,"Village of the Damned HAS to be one of the best ways to ever introduce viewers to a horror movie- by having everyone in a tiny town suddenly fall to the ground, pass out, and wake up 6 hours later unsure what just happened to them.  Some people fall alseep in a classroom rather innocently, while others pass out while cooking on the grill or driving leading to deadly consequences.  Can you think of a more enticing way to lure viewers into a horror movie than this?  I sure can't, haha.  Really excellent all around.  And soon after when it's discovered all the mothers are pregnant and give birth at the same time to blonde-haired little girls or boys?  Great, great stuff.

It's about a group of little evil alien children that have the power to not only see into people's minds and read what they're thinking, but also make people *do* whatever the children want.  Whenever you see the children's eyeballs glowing red, get ready!  For example, if the children wish a make a loud-mouthed janitor climb a ladder, point a broomstick towards his chest and jump off the building into a car windshield, they'll do it!  This is just one of many twisted little things the children make the innocent people of this tiny village experience.  It's a really sick and original concept for a horror flick, and I appreciate it.  Having the kids be adorable is an added bonus because the townspeople honestly would never suspect the kids being capable of such unforgivable evil and rage.

The one girl of the group of kids seems especially smart and accurate with her portrayal of being totally heartless and evil.  When she gives a speech about being a superior species and simply eliminating everyone in the town as part of the process without feeling any emotion or feeling whatsoever was almost award-winningly awesome.  Really good stuff.  With a speech that goosebump-like, hopefully she grew up to become famous in other movies.

That said, this is the 1995 remake.  The original is good but significantly less frightening since the original contains atmosphere moreso than actually showing tormenting people.  Still, both versions are highly recommended.

Now this movie does have one minor flaw- Kirstie Alley.  She maybe not be a bad actress, but she's not at *all* appropriate for a horror movie.  She's basically a detective sent on the scene to initially figure out what's wrong with the town and why everyone suddenly passed out simultaneously, but eventually she helps give birth to the babies at the hospital.  She comes off so overdramatic more often than not, and I don't care for it.  Most viewers I imagine won't care for her performance in Village of the Damned.

Overall, fantastic horror.  Maybe cheesy with a few parts that haven't dated very well, but the soundtrack, acting, horror, atmosphere, suspense, everything that counts is really good.",1363910400,,2858,4.865424430641822

When the women awaken, they find themselves impregnated by some unknown force. The resulting children all arrive in perfect health and possess an incredible intelligence, but behind their cold, unfeeling eyes lies a dreadful secret that they will kill to keep hidden. The VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED was revived in 1995 by Horror icon John Carpenter, which many consider to be the first slip towards a downward decline for the aging director. It is not that Carpenter has turned out a bad film necessarily, but even worse, he is guilty of directing a bland and boring one that lacks any form of artistic flare or originality. Despite remaining faithful to John Wyndham's classic novel, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED plays out like a drab made-for-television drama, offering up far fewer scares than the earlier screen adaptation from 1960. The vapid cast is largely to blame, as they appear to be even more soulless than The Children. Christopher Reeve sleepwalks through another dry performance while Kirstie Alley and Mark Hamill are just plain awful. Although the story essentially calls for The Children to look and act like automatons, their bad wigs, unnatural dress, and stilted attempts at conveying this on screen take them far beyond the realm of believability. Carpenter also overindulges in the science fiction elements of the plot, and adds an unnecessary amount of bloodshed that really has no place in the film. What we are left with is a poorly-played outline of Wyndham's original concept that lacks the depth and social significance which were instilled in the 1960 film.

If it had been set in the time it was written, it would have made more sense, but would still have been a pretty weak story. A massive blackout impregnates the town woman with alien children who can see your thoughts and force you to do what they wish. It's not the best story to begin with.

Is it just me or did this movie leave you entertained enough to be mad at it, just me? When I first watched this I will admit that I did not hate it like some of my friends did. I guess it helps that I am a John Carpenter fan and some of the deaths were cool to me. But every time I watch it now I can see all the potential that was there and wasted. I never doubt Carpenter on atmosphere and  here I feel he did a good enough job. But there is something there that just screams I am missing something.

Midwich California is just like any other town full of people, cars, and businesses going on day by day. That is until one day a strange mist appears in the town and soon every one there is out cold. When everyone wakes up it seems all women who can physically still carry a baby are indeed pregnant. Time goes by and all the pregnant women give birth at the same time with all babies surviving minus one. The children start to grow at a crazy pace and seem to have powers beyond that of any human, funny because they just might not be human.

For the guy that remade ""The Thing"" so wonderfully I was a bit surprised at how this one turned out. It feels like a classic Carpenter flick but it falls short like some of his later flicks did as well. I did enjoy the deaths at the hands of the kids or should I say at the minds of the kids. And some of the performances were really good but like most remakes it did not live up to the potential. Christopher Reeve is great to watch in his last film before his accident that left him paralyzed. Thomas Dekker is fun in the lead role against the kids and Kirstie Alley is good but I am glad her character got it from the kids. Speaking of the kids I must say that any horror film benefits from having creepy kids in it. Sure they are not as creepy as kids in other films but kids are freaky in these flicks, they really are.

When watching this now I think Carpenter was going for the type of mood and film that he created with ""The Fog"". I love that film and only like this film so I guess he was not completely successful if that was what he was going for. But even still it feels like he was going for an old school horror flick here. Also before I forget it was cool seeing Mark Hamill here as a preacher. Any way I do like this movie and I think a lot of people reading this would as well. Not as good as the original film but still it is better than most remember it to be.

What must be done to stop the evil from winning?

This film isn't very memorable. The acting, story, drama, and dialogue are all completely mediocre. I can't recommend buying this DVD. The best I can do is tell you that it's an ok rental.

I read the book, The Midwich Cockoos by John Wyndham,  and saw the 1960 version shortly after it was released.  The original movie, as well as the remake under review, adhers closely to the book, even the dialogue.  This story is a pioneering example of the evil child genre of horror movies, such movies as The Bad Seed and the more recent releases, Case 39 and Orphan.  This entire brood of evil children with glowing eyes is a frightening  sight, and the remake, with its improved special effects and really evil-looking children is scary indeed.  Christopher Reeve played the role of the village doctor, the role played by George Sanders in the original film; unfortunately, this was the last or close to the last of Christopher Reeve's movies before the terrible accident that left him paralyzed.  I'm not at all sure of the chronology, but I can't help but think that this story inspired Stephen King's Children of the Corn, as I think The Car inspired his Christine and Maximum overdrive.

We get the white-haired, flare-eyed kids, knocking off those who get in their way. Christopher Reeve is OK as the town doctor, but certainly nothing special.

I just caught the last 2/3rds of this movie on AMC, and it motivated me to search the net for other people's thoughts on it, and as usual, I ended up here. I first saw this movie when it was originally released, so it had been a while, but the one thing that has stuck with me is the memory of not liking it very much. So after catching the last part of it on AMC, I brought it up on Netflix and watched it through so I could give it a new honest review. What I had remembered still rang true.

I love John Carpenter movies, so it was with disheartening that this one fell flat. This movie is like an instance when all of the wrong things come together at once. All of the wrong actors were chosen and the budget appears to have been really low. Christopher Reeve does his best to carry this movie along, but even he should not have been cast for this particular role. Mark Hamil is the creepiest priest ever and Kirstie Alley is as horrible and unconvincing as she is in just about every role she plays. The woman who plays the priest's wife is better suited for a comedy role. Watch the scene when they're gathered together like angry villagers with torches and you'll see what I mean. The school custodian was made to be the stereotypical closet mumbling drunk as with every movie that has one.

I believe it's the little things, the attention to detail that can make or break a movie which is another problem with this. This was filmed as if it was a Lifetime movie, and everyone knows how terrible those are. For instance, when the entire town blacks out, it shows half of them lying comfortably with their heads resting on one outstretched arm. When the fellow in the truck that drives back into the ""hot"" area at the beginning swerves to miss a truck and blacks out, one shot shows him passed out, then another shot shows the truck clearly empty, then before he crashes, he's there again. The children's acting is just ok, but even that is almost forgivable. Even though the children are supposed to be emotionless and clone like,for the life of me I don't understand why in the world would they all have the same haircut. Why were only 10 children conceived when the town is full of women? Why does the one stillborn missing child look like a leftover alien prop from the X files?

This film falls into what I consider John Carpenter's dark days, where he was either under budgeted or was lost in his film direction like ""In The Mouth of Madness"", which is may be his worst film ever. The best part of the whole movie for me is Carpenter's cameo at the gas station pay phone around the eight minute mark.",1319241600,,2650,4.3603238866396765

It isn't scary.  The dialogue is awkward, stilted, and dull.  The pacing is jittery.  And the acting seems so forced it is just terrible.",1296000000,2,626,4.971153846153846
55885,3,0783230427,"The 90's weren't too kind to writer/director John Carpenter. After pioneering the slasher genre in the late 70's and redefining the marriage of sci-fi and horror in the 80's, he was met with flop after flop, with each successive film receiving a smaller budget than the last. Enter ""Village of the Damned,"" a little-seen remake of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1960-film/dp/B00027JYMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1960 film</a>&nbsp;based on the novel by John Wyndham. While Carpenter's mark is clearly made, the director's frustrations can't help but ooze through in this serviceable yet underwhelming thriller.

A sleepy small town is knocked out only to find its female residents (apparently all 10 of them) inexplicably knocked up. To terminate or not to terminate, that is the question. When a chain-smoking scientist (a pre-weight gain Kirstie Alley) offers the women a cash bonus in exchange for seeing their pregnancies through, they ignorantly accept. Unfortunately, the little tykes grow up to be little Hellraisers in need of a good spanking. They are mean to their parents, they defy anyone who gets in their way and worst of all, they manage to look sort of cute in doing so. Even Superman himself (Christopher Reeve in his final film role) proves to be no match for the toxic tots, as the film caps off with a match of wits that is, well, child's play.

In spite of his low budget, Carpenter makes the best of things. Quite possibly the director who is best at making something out of nothing, our hero replaces heavy gore with carefully placed sound effects, effective musical cues and other things best left to the imagination. In one scene, a woman's hand is forced into a boiling pot of water to the point where her arm looks like a giant hot dog. Although we never see it really happen, it's one of many moments in the film that will have you squirming in your seat, imagining things far worse than what's onscreen. That's the brilliance of John Carpenter, and why ""Village of the Damned"" isn't quite the dud it's been made out to be all these years. Sure, it's got hammy performances all around (Mark Hamill in particular plays it up as the town priest) but it's still an interesting little film that goes to show that even at his lowest point, John Carpenter can run circles around everyone else.",1284422400,9,2364,5.043478260869565

55889,4,0783230427,"A classic of science fiction by John Wyndham, The Midwich Cuckoos. John Carpenter makes it into a film that is disquieting. The end of the world will never come of course but it is all already programmed within our own genetic heritage. Evil is in our genes in the possibility that is being developed and progressively monitored by the social system that our human nature is producing to see the end of emotions, of empathy and compassion, the end of any kind of emotion. It is all the more disquieting because this social system of ours is producing absolute individualism and yet it is this very absolute individualism, when becoming the common point of a certain group of people that will lead them to absolute and cold is not glacial power and destructivity in the sole name of survival. That sounds and is horrible but absolutely possible. There is no difference between these mutants and the posse that is going to lynch them. They only want to survive even if that means the destruction of the other antagonistic group. But the story has no way out, no smallest ounce of hope. The doctor whose wife produced one of the children who should have been ten and are nine because of a still born will eventually use dynamite to destroy them. Even if you want to go beyond the divide you will unavoidably be led to the conclusion this divide is an absolute barrier. You will be transformed into a monster yourself. There is no escape and it is not the fact that the David who lost his mate who was the still born is escaping with his mother that promises a better future that will bring us hope. Alone he might be nothing, his feelings for his lost and unknown mate might be movingly pathetic but he cannot go against his genetic nature and his genetic nature is to look for a mate, for a partner in survival. Yet I found Carpenter's characters slightly too superficial, not deep enough, too cold in one word, though Carpenter is simple and that is an asset in the genre, no baroque or even rococo over-killing. That's lucky because those kids are nothing but a new branch or brand of Nazi SS, and those new branches or brands are becoming  by far too many and too common in our modern world though they are always isolated in one little section of the world and have not been able so far to go beyond two or three places at the same time. But they are mobile and that is the real danger because they can eventually build some kind of a network. This time it is becoming really scary.

55890,3,0783230427,"Question:

What movie has been able to bring together a Vulcan, Jedi Knight, and Man of Steel?

Answer:

John Carpenter's remake of the Village of the Damned.

Director John Carpenter's remake as well as the similarly titled 1960 film was based on John Wyndham's novel ""The Midwich Cuckoos.""  Carpenter's science fiction/horror flick also brought together the talents of Mark Hamill (Star Wars: A New Hope; Empire Strikes Back; Return of the Jedi); Kirstie Alley (Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan; Cheers); and Christopher Reeve (Superman, Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace) among others.  Village of the Damned (1995) focuses on the mysterious birth of ten children (with one being stillborn) in the isolated town of Midwich.  Dr. Alan Chaffee (Reeve) and Reverend George (Hamill) are among the parents of these seeming genetically linked children while Dr. Susan Verner (Alley) is a government sanctioned doctor whom observers the nine children from conception till their present age.

The children display potent intelligence, telepathic, and mind control abilities--which they use to sadistically eliminate those that they consider to be a threat to them--though the course of the film.  In the end, after the children have killed most of the principal characters, Chaffer loads a time bomb into a briefcase and sacrifices himself in order to put an end to the children's evil campaign against humanity.

For Reeve, Carpenter's film as well as the 1995 suspense thriller ""Above Suspicion"" would be his last before a devastating horseback riding accident that left him paralyzed.",1190246400,2,1608,5.2952755905511815
55891,5,0783230427,"For some reason this movie seems to always get bad reviews from critics and viewers.  I'm not exactly sure why, but I think that people expect something different from John Carpenter and this wasn't it.  They compare it to his other movies rather than looking at it on it's own.

I think that the movie was great, very well done in the way that it was shot and the way that the actors portrayed each character.  It's interesting to see the different twist that John Carpenter put on the original novel by John Wyndam, ""The Midwich Cuckoos.""  The tone of the movie is very eerie, with everything shot in a sort of gray, monotone atmosphere.  The leader of the children is absolutely chilling and gives a great performance.  I think that she really makes the movie with how she speaks and acts throughout the film.  People just aren't used to seeing some seven year old look as if she could snap you in half with a blink of an eye.. literally.

The visual affects are awesome.  Who doesn't like to see crazy glowing eyes?  It's just cool looking.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone not looking to rip it apart just because it's not 'gory' or 'violent' enough for them.",1177459200,4,1172,4.502369668246446
55892,2,0783230427,"Although the most prolific of the 70s directors who worked their way up from superior exploitation to the mainstream, John Carpenter's flame may have burned the brightest but it also burned the most briefly before he descended into lifeless hackwork. Even the more promising projects floundered when confronted with his increasingly pedestrian handling. His 1995 remake of Village of the Damned is a classic example. Ill-advisedly relocated to a California coastal town inhabited by Superman, Luke Skywalker and Crocodile Dundee's girlfriend, the special effects are more prominent and the body count is multiplied more than ten times as villagers burn themselves to death, impale themselves, doctors blind or perform autopsies on themselves, all staged with remarkable flatness and a complete lack of atmosphere or foreboding. A few good ideas are thrown in, but aside from one schoolroom sequence and the foolproof ""brick wall"" ending, it's desperately dull and under characterised stuff that feels like it was made by a wage slave reluctantly punching a time clock every day. More like Village of the Darned, the most mysterious thing about it is just how Michael Pare managed to get such prominent billing when he doesn't even make it past the title sequence.",1165795200,,1263,5.288557213930348

She's trying to convince him to teach the children separately from the normal children. Dr. Chaffee; ""What could I possibly teach them?"" Jill answers, ""Humanity."" It should've been a great movie. Unfortunately Christopher Reeve's excellent acting was overpowered by Kirstie Alley's incredibly horrible acting. Why any director would use her to play a hard shell government doctor is beyond me.

55896,1,0783230427,"I tried very hard to enjoy this film, being a fan of John Carpenter, of the original English version of the film, and of the original book by John Wyndham.  Unfortunately it is a very poor effort and for me ranks as John Carpenter's worst film.

Carpenter is the horror/sf/fantasy B-movie great of current times, comparable in many ways with Roger Corman and Val Lewton from the mid 20th century.  He has a deft touch and usually manages to turn in a quirkily personal vision which is always worth watching, even if he occasionally loses complete control of his films.  Like Corman, he sometimes seems to lack the patience required in order to be a really great director.

In his ""The Thing"" he brought the much loved Howard Hawks thriller from the early 50s up to date, and to his credit he made a film which was both original and also more faithful to the book than the earlier effort, but he completely missed the target with ""The Village of the Damned"".

The atmosphere of the original book is all about tension, claustrophobia, and the terror that the people next door in a peaceful village setting are not what they seem.  It depends on malevolence and an understated, brooding approach in order to work.  Carpenter failed completely to capture this on film, and consequently his ""cuckoos"" are merely nasty and spiteful.

They do not have the required air of unstoppable power, authority and - most importantly - intelligence.  The frightening thing about the children in both the book and the earlier film was that they were always two or three steps ahead of the adults, toying with them as a human child might unemotionally torment a small animal.  The audience, identifying with the adults, should be drawn into the situation and feel personally threatened, but Carpenter did not understand how to achieve this state of threat by understatement.  His style is too gory and obvious for this type of film, which needs a more subtle, romantic or gentle hand in order to work.  Ron Howard would be the perfect director for this film, precisely because he does not work in the horror genre.

Think that sounds silly?  Well imagine this - a version of ""Cocoon"" in which the old people bathe in the ""energised"" water of the pool, but then are ""infected"" by the alien presence which uses them as camouflage to quietly and methodically take over the planet, rather like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".  THAT is the sort of atmosphere that this film should have had, but completely missed.

Apart from that, there are also some gaping continuity holes in the script, and some truly absurd scenes that do not advance the action - evidence of Carpenter's typical haste and lack of patience with his films.  What a shame that this was Christopher Reeves' last film role.",1134000000,17,2769,4.745302713987474

I remember hoping that Carpenter would give ""Village of the Damned"" the same treatment he gave to his remake of ""The Thing"". With ""The Thing"" you had Carpenter adding his own touches, creating a movie that was similar to the original film, but still stood on it's own and came away with an 80's horror masterpiece. And while ""Village of the Damned"" is a pretty good movie, it just doesn't feel like a ""John Carpenter"" movie. You don't get that steady tension found in his other films like ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"" or ""The Thing"", where the mood and atmosphere of the movie really kept you in suspense the entire way through.

The special effects are a bit cheesy, and the bad things that happen are mostly all too predictable. Carpenter has written the music with Dave Davis (from The Kinks), and I didn't think I'd ever say this but maybe Carpenter should have hired a professional film music composer instead of doing it himself (with Davis). The 80's feeling of the music is a bit cool, but much of the music is just a backround sound that's not driving the movie in any direction.

A few celebrities in leading roles: Kirstie Alley (from Cheers), Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Linda Koslowsky (Chrocodile Dundee), and Christopher Reeve (Superman) feature. And John Carpenter makes a director cameo (guy at the pay phone).

55900,3,0783230427,"Village Of The Damned is probably my least favorite Carpenter film, though I don't hate it.  First, it's a remake, and I'm pretty outspoken when it comes to remakes.  Granted, Carpenter made The Thing, but that film didn't seem so much of a remake of the 50s film as it did a more true to form version of the original story.  This is basically just an updated reworking of the original film  .  If you haven't seen the original Village Of The Damned, you owe it to yourself to check it out.  Second, Village seemed a little rushed, coming out only a few months after Carpenter's superior In The Mouth Of Madness.  For those unaware, here's the lowdown:  One day in the small town of Midwich, every man, woman and child falls unconscious for six hours, resulting in a few deaths(one poor sap passes out on the barbecue grill) and a buttload of confusion.  Shortly after, the women all find out they're pregnant, and they all give birth at the same time.  The kids are intelligent, white-haired killing machines determined to kick everyone's butt.  The sudden jump from toddlers to ten year olds isn't really explained.  Do they grow at a terribly fast rate or did ten years pass?  I guess it's really not important, but I couldn't help wondering.  Actually the first 40 minutes of this movie are quite good and quite promising.  Unfortunately after that, it just doesn't know what it wants to do.  It's not particulalry scary, suspenseful or all that interesting.  You can only see those glowing eyes so many times before it loses it's punch, and this effect is way overused.  The latter half of the movie consists mainly of the kids wandering around and occasionally killing someone while the adults eventually get fed up and take action-action in the form of a Frankenstein-style mob complete with torches.  I do get a little sad watching this and seeing Christopher Reeve only about a year away from his accident.  He does the best job one could do with his role.  Michael(Eddie and the Cruisers)Pare is given way too brief an appearance, and Mark Hamill even has a role as a priest, and also has the best lines in the film(""What are they gonna do to us?"", ""We NEED fingerpaints"").  All in all, Village Of The Damned is harmless to watch coz it still retains the Carpenter style, and the first half is actually quite good.

55901,3,0783230427,"Being that I am not familiar with the story behind Village Of The Damned, or the John Wyndham novel (The Midwich Cuckoos) upon which it is based, I will try to keep my overview of the plot brief.

The story begins with a strange mist floating over a coastal town in the USA, and ten women suddenly find themselves pregnant with children that turn out to be alien creatures in humanoid form with immense powers of mind control. One specific fault I found with the plot is that, for supposedly ""emotionless"" creatures, these children sure get upset pretty easily. From what I could ascertain, much of the original idea of the story was to raise questions about mankind's inability to accept the unknown, and Reverend George (Mark Hamill) keeps the film consistent with this idea. The heroes, such as they are, consist of Allen Chaffee (Christopher Reeve), Jill McGowan (Linda Kozlowski), Frank McGowan (Michael Par), and Doctor Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley). The last of these characters is a modern addition to the story that holds little rhyme nor reason except to modernize the script a touch, much like the more explicit violence and speech of this 1995 production. The bad guys are a group of white-haired children who sit around doing nothing a lot on a farmhouse for years until someone finally decides that there's something not quite normal about them and that they Must Be Stopped.

Not having seen the original 1960 production of this film, I cannot really comment on whether this is the best version of the film that one can lay out their thirty dollars for. However, if there is one thing that director John Carpenter does well, it is to take old horror stories and bring them into the modern age, albeit with variable results. Much of this film is unintentionally funny, and much of it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but the whole sense of this on-screen town being doomed is carried well enough to make for an entertaining film. It is also worth noting that this is the last film Christopher Reeve appeared in before he was paralysed from the neck down in a horse-riding accident, a truly sad situation given his commanding presence as an actor. I personally liked Village Of The Damned according to John Carpenter. Many others don't, but I found it enjoyable enough to warrant repeated viewings.",1107129600,7,2314,4.768079800498753
55902,4,0783230427,""". . . Seeist thou as man sees?""
These questions are asked in the Book of Proverbs and in John Carpenter's Village of the Damned, a remake of director Wolf Rilla's 1960 version, both adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos.
Village of the Damned is the story of the simultaneous births of telepathic children to every woman of child-bearing age in the coastal village of Midwich, California.  Carpenter's version is more bloody than the version set in Midwich, England, starring George Sanders (but, like many of Carpenter's movies, not as bloody as people think).
Carpenter's remake is more hopeful.  Maybe the filmmakers wanted to leave the story open for a sequel, or maybe the survival of one of the children without his extraterrestrial mate is meant to show the possibility of union between the two inimical species.  (""Are we to pity you?"" asks Mara, daughter of the town doctor and leader of the alien children, as she explains the facts of cosmic evolution to her father.)
The woman quoting Proverbs is the wife of the minister killed by the children before he can shoot their leader.  The minister's wife leads torch-bearing villagers who might have come from a forties Universal horror film.  Though put to the children, the question (Are you human?) is also directed at the other villagers and at us.
This Village of the Damned begins with the same deliberate pacing of the original film, a mark of British horror.  Something passes over Midwich and everyone blacks out for six hours.  Not everyone wakes up.
If there's a theme it's what duty parents owe their children.  Children often seem like alien monsters even when they weren't conceived in a blackout by an interstellar cloud.  Children demand food and education about the world and ultimately they demand that their parents step aside - -  die - -  for them to inherit it.
Here there are good reasons for parents to feel uneasy about their soon-to-be-born offspring - -  some women are virgins or have been separated from their husbands so the children couldn't have been conceived normally.  But none of the parents reject the children for that reason.
The mothers have no choice.  After the mass conceptions they all have dreams of  carrying their babies to term - -  the first telepathic action of the childrens' group mind.  The men accept the children, too.  The angriest husband, who's been away for months, at first leaves his wife, but then joins her in the huge delivery room where all the children are born on the same night.
After the children are born the adults, even their parents, aren't safe.  The childrens' urge to survive and the knowledge that one species or the other will dominate causes them to play on the emotional bond that exists for the parents, especially the mothers, without being hampered by it themselves.  This isn't much different than the biological adaptation normal infants have acquired to ensure their survival.  David is the exception, the one whose ties to the group mind are weakest.
One of the children was stillborn and taken away by a government scientist (or was it?).  She was to be David's partner.  Mara tells David that his lack of a mate does make him less valuable to the group.  As the children realize they have to escape the town and their parents' control - -  grow up - -  the town doctor, Mara's father, has the opportunity (and therefore the responsiblility) to try to save humanity.  David, too, makes a choice.
Parents, especially ones with green-eyed children, might have some disturbing thoughts after watching this movie.",1078617600,4,3571,4.859504132231405
55903,3,0783230427,"If horror maven John Carpenter decides to do a remake of a classic sci-fi horror film, it should be safe for fans to assume that it's gonna be great. After all, this is the groundbreaking filmmaker who turned Michael Myers into a slasher-film icon in HALLOWEEN (1978) and directed the highly revered THE THING (1982), itself a remake of the classic 1951 film THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD.  So when Mr. Carpenter's 1995 remake of the classic 1960 thriller VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED came out, it should've been a fantastic cinematic experience for horror and science-fiction fans.  It should've been.  Sadly, it wasn't.
For those of you unfamiliar with the basic plot of both films, here's a quick summary.  In the middle of a seemingly average day, all of the residents of a small village mysteriously fall unconscious, and anyone attempting to go into the slumbering village also passes out.  When the folks finally awaken, most everything seems to be perfectly normal.  Normal, that is, with the exception that all of the women of the village capable of bearing children are pregnant.  The mystery children are all birthed nine months later, and as they grow, it is very apparent that all of them have eerily similar physical characteristics.  Also, they mature and learn much faster than the average child, which is creepy enough.  But the real terror begins when they start exercising their preternatural psychic powers.
In the original 1960 film, it was always tacitly implied that the strange children were fathered by extraterrestrials, but nothing occurs in the film to blatantly prove such.  This actually adds to the mystery of the origin of the children, which in turn heightens the suspense and terror...and the fun for the audience.  Unfortunately, Carpenter's 1995 remake loses most of this fear-of-the-unknown suspense when it is revealed that one of the children had miscarried, and the aborted fetus, which has been preserved in the office of the village doctor, looks like the stereotypical sci-fi alien, complete with bug-eyes and an almond-shaped head.
The original film stars British actor George Sanders as the astute ""father"" of one of the mystery tots who eventually infers the evil nature of the village offspring and ultimately saves the world.  Sanders was an accomplished veteran of both the British and U.S. cinema, and his talent and experience add a great deal of credibility to the film's fantastic plot.  But for some reason, John Carpenter chose to cast Christopher Reeve as the lead in his remake.  Though Reeve is an adequate actor who did a fine job as Clark Kent and his titular alter ego in SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (1978), he just simply does not have the range or depth of Sanders and is therefore unable to pull off a convincing average-Joe hero.  Add to this the tepid performance of supporting actress Kirstie Alley (TV's CHEERS)--here grossly miscast as a government scientist--and it becomes impossible for the audience to suspend its disbelief and surrender to the fantasy of this film.
Carpenter's remake of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is not without its moments, however.  Gore hounds and fans of slasher films like Carpenter's HALLOWEEN will enjoy the scene where a man lies roasting on a barbeque grill.  And though they are not as genuinely eerie as the children in the original film, the evil kiddos in Carpenter's remake can often be creepy little brats, and some of their scenes are quite scary.
Overall, the 1995 remake of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is a disappointment, and true horror fans should avoid it and instead push harder for the original 1960 film to get the DVD treatment.  In the mean time, fans who want to spend an evening with John Carpenter will probably get more satisfaction from viewing one of his other films like THE FOG (1980) or THEY LIVE (1988).",1071014400,26,3805,4.93730407523511
55904,4,0783230427,"Midwich was a nice, friendly place to live - until one day, the whole town mysteriously falls asleep for a few hours. A while later, the town discovers 10 women are pregnant - including the town virgin, and a wife whose husband was away.
Nine months later - all women give birth, and 9 of these babies survive. But their families (and then the town) soon discover that these are no ordinary little kids - while the white haired, bright eyed kids are quick o develop physically and seem to poses psychic and mind reading abilities, their moral values wish a lot to desire...
While the moral issues arising from this story line do get acknowledged, the writer / director team chose to go for the obvious creeps and thrills from this movie than to go into morality issues too deeply. This is a legitimate persuit, and it is a good movie as a thriller / suspense / horror movie, another production of it (looking into different angles of the story) can remake it and get a completely different result...",1071014400,,999,4.555555555555555
55905,4,0783230427,"This remake of the classic 1960 chiller is one of John Carpenter's more underrated films and never fails to disappoint for overall creepiness.  Christopher Reeve (in his final big screen role before his paralyzing accident) plays a town physician who discovers that 10 women in his small town are all inexplicably pregnant at the same time after all waking up from a mysterious sleep inducing myst.  When the children are born, they all look basically the exact same and can control people's minds.  The original Village of the Damned is one of the creepiest films of all time, basically because of the fact that it's not what you see, but what you don't see, that gives you those chills down your spine.  In this remake, Carpenter goes for his usual blend of shocks and gore that do lower the overall creepy atmosphere of the film, but all together Village of the Damned is still a shocker that does it's job well.

55906,5,0783230427,"I saw the original ""Village of the Damned"" when it was released back in 1960.  Being a child myself, I was horrified at those evil little kids with the white hair and the glowing eyes.  The inimitable George Sanders and that lovely British horror queen Barbara Shelley starred and it scared the bejesus out of me!  Now in the latter part of the 20th century, horror maven John Carpenter remakes it, and along with ""The Thing"", Carpenter did himself well in making the remakes original in their own rights without sacrificing the mood and feel of the earlier versions.  There is an innate eeriness in evil children; one cannot remove one self from realizing that despite all the evil they are doing, they are still children.  Christopher Reeve is gallant and controls the nuances of his performance; Kirstie Alley is deliciously over the top in her role as the government scientist who wants to (what else) study the children; Mark Hamill makes a rare appearance as the town's minister, and he gives the role an unusual grace and subtlety to a cliche role; the children all do nicely, as one would expect children to do.  Lindsey Haun as Mara and Thomas Dekker as David are especially memorable.  However, for me, Linda Kozlowski's performance as Jill, David's mother, commands the essence of futility but firm hope, and makes her the real ""star"" of the film.  Hard to believe she's Crocodile Dundee's woman, in this change of pace role.
The music and cinematography are also supportive.
A GOOD THRILLER.",1068422400,,1503,4.821011673151751
55907,5,0783230427,I can remeber very little of this movie because i saw it when i was about 8 and i am now 14. All I remember was this mist coming over the vilage and putting every one to sleep making the wemon pregnat and them having demonic children that can make you do freaky things. For instants that scene where that one mother gave her child that hot soup and the child made the mother stick her hand in the boiling pot of water (ouch)Then that one scene where the children are at the eye doctor and the lead child comes in and makes the doctor put the eye drops in her eyes (ouch!) Then the last scene where Reeve's is in the barn and the dinomite blows them up. Thats all i remember. A must own!,1046476800,2,686,4.051470588235294

  Great movie, I give it two thumbs way up! That, Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, and The Others are my five favorite scary movies, even though Freddy Crougor is great too!

55910,5,0783230427,"Village of the Damned is a remake of a 1960 version, which is based on a book, The Midwich Cuckoos. Village of the Damned is about a small town in which everybody passes out. Nobody can get in or out. When they wake up, 10 women are pregnant, one a virgin. Only 9 of the children are born; one is stillborn. These children have platinum white hair and cool emotionless personalities. It turns out they can control bodies and read minds.
People seem to have mixed feelings about this movie. Some say it ..., and others say it was great. Some feel halfway. So, of course, my opinion might be different than yours.
I'm one of the people who loved it.
Most of the acting was good, like Christopher Reeve, who did a good performance as the father of Mara, the leader of the children, who was played by Lindsey Haun. Lindsey did a great job as the emotionless, cruel child. Thomas Dekker was good as David, the one good child, teetering between emotionless and being normal. The special effects are good, but this wasn't too scary; though it did have freaky moments that made you jump. It was violent and kinda gory at times.",1027382400,,1119,4.463414634146342

This movie just goes to show that you don't need alot of profanity, nudity, and gore to have a good horror film. What I really like about Village of the Damned is that it doesn't lose its scariness. I have watched it quite a bit and I still get a tad scared every time I see it. John Carpenter also does a good job with the music which adds some creepy effects to the movie. The main reason I don't give Village of the Damned a 5th star is because it is somewhat slow starting out but it does a great job eventually picking up. If you are someone who has nightmares from watching scary movies, I wouldn't recommend seeing this.",1024099200,3,696,4.2406015037593985

55913,1,0783230427,"This has got to be one of the worst movies of all time. The cast looked sad and bewildered throughout the entire movie, and I don't think that it was caused by their fear of the other-worldly children. No. They were terrified of what this turkey would do to their already-flagging careers. Christopher Reeves looked almost embarrassed saying the same lines over and over again for the whole 99 minutes. When the children forced Kirsty Alley to gut herself with a scalpel I'm sure that I could see a relieved smile break out on her face just before she passed on. Mark Hamil's performance was convincing despite the majority of his lines being a string of hackneyed 'these-children-should-be-damned-to-hell' tirades.
Repetition was what the movie suffered most. The original book, the Midwich Cuckoos was an inspirational story for its time, but much of the ground has already been covered to death in contemporary TV science fiction. The movie simply failed to capitalise on adult moral and social issues caused by the unwelcome visitors, or in fact the plight of the visitors themselves. For example it could have tackled the emotional issues felt by the parents by their offspring shunning then subjugating them. Instead it fell back on special effects and elaborate murders scenes. Therefore, the whole experience felt empty and dragged on unnecessarily. The whole thing could have been condensed into a snappy 30 minute Outer Limits episode and had much more impact.
I read the book as a child and really wanted the movie to be good, but it simply was not. Spend your hard-earned elsewhere and let John Carpenter forget his folly.",1020211200,8,1634,4.989010989010989

One of a small village, people suddenly lost their mind for a while, after that, some women are pregnant all together. Then they give birth to a baby who has a special power with white hair. It is a very interesting creation. These kids destroy the village and no one can control of them. Children, who are superior to other people, are made by particular power from the outer world. Finally, they live with themselves without the other people, make a wall to protect from the others. It shows that human have a compromising mind and discriminate people who are different from others. Because of this reason, in the end, the children hurt village people even their parents. This is a self-protection instinct, which is strong for them. After all, the character that beat off the children is a Superman, Christopher Reeve. He is a physician and his daughter is one of the children. He sacrifices himself to get rid of the children by using bomb. John Carpenter, he is an attractive director.

One big change can be found in the personality of one of the children, David. The child actors are as good in this movie as in the original. They are eerie, but maybe slightly less than in the original version, because of the screenplay possibly due to the fact that this movie is in color.

The small town of Midwich one-day falls inexplicably asleep. Many accidents occur due to the sudden narcolepsy, which is exaggerated in John carpenter style. The result is that several of the village females including a virgin are in a motherly way.
