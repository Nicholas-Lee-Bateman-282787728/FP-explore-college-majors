1993454,5,B0001EK9VK,Yo from the clips i have seen this bboy(breakdance)film is off the hook. Its good for begginer or intermidiate dancers. The first disc gives you the basic moves like the six step. Well anyways i don't want to tell you everything because i could be here forever. But anyway get this video its tight. Later bboys bgirls keep dancin.,1076198400,17,330,4.610169491525424
1993455,5,B0001EK9VK,"With absolutely no dance background, I just wanted to learn some things and mess around.  This video breaks the moves down into simple steps that are easy to follow.  Very happy with the purchase.",1289347200,,196,4.735294117647059
1993456,5,B0001EK9VK,"If you have will to learn on your own get this DVD!!! U don't even need to go to classes because this DVD shows you & teaches you everything. Some steps should be tought a lil slower & in more detail, but still awsome DVD!!!",1287360000,,224,4.0

1993458,2,B0001EK9VK,"This DVD could have been awesome. Unfotunately, it falls on its face. The dancers know how to dance.  However, they for some reason recorded many of the instructional tracks without audio.  Even my K-mart camcorder can do audio.  I can barely tolerate this, but then comes the fatal flaw.  This DVD does not play properly on most DVD players.  If you go to the menu, and then select a particular move to learn, it displays an error message on ALL 5 of my DVD players (something like ""data rate exceeds capability, overide?"").  I have never seen this message before, and own thousands of DVDs.  Doesnt matter if I play on blueray player, portable DVD player, standard DVD player, PS3.  The compilation just sucks.  Having to constantly override each time I want to rewatch a selection just brings me to seathing anger.

There are some good things about this DVD.  Breakeasy in New York is a great and reknowned teacher (would have been nice to hear his voice!).  The advanced class with Zulugremlin is great, watched it like 5 times.

All in all, as I own like 10 different breakdancing DVDs, I would definately AVOID this one.  You will be much happier with Broadway Dance Center: Breakin Foundations (not sold on amazon but by far the best first DVD that eventually teaches a whole routine, utube sample [...]) or Breakdancing-Completely Street(carefully explained individual basic and advanced moves), or Top 20 Breakdance Moves(entertaining jokester teaches both breakin and hiphop).  All of these are clearly better.",1257552000,12,1520,4.952569169960475

1993460,4,B0001EK9VK,This is a great dvd set for beginners! It goes through the basics step  by step at a good pace and then builds on them. The music isn't bad and the language is clean. It shows how to make the moves your own and put them together. My son used it and then his uncle borrowed it to brush up on his basics as well.,1244073600,2,310,3.769230769230769
1993461,4,B0001EK9VK,"My son loves the video, except for the problem with the passcode. Every time we try to put on a new chapter, it asks for a passcode (which we don't have). Without the code, the dvd freezes for a couple of minutes and then plays again.

1993462,5,B0001EK9VK,the producers of this video did an amazing job. excellent break down of the steps.  excellent advice for drills and warm ups. excellent styling.  ive seen hella dance vids.  breakdance is hard to teach and these guys did a remarkable job.  im impressed.  proprs.,1232668800,,262,4.863636363636363
1993463,4,B0001EK9VK,"Much as I love my 14 yr. old daughter, her dancing style could probably best be described as ""what the...?!""  When she expressed an interest in improving her skills, especially in the break dancing arena, I was totally supportive!  But I wanted to find something that would be appropriate for this 14 yr. old, and her 11 yr. old sister.  This video turned out to be just what we were looking for.  The video starts out with a warm up routine, then has several instruction sequences that are easy to follow and understand (works well for my daughters), while still teaching skills and moves that are impressive and current.  It also has clips from competitions, giving the viewer an idea of what these moves actually look like on the floor.  The video is simple and well organized, making it easy to find and repeat the exact sequences you want to view.  And from what I've seen, this video is ""clean"" - moves, clothes, language, etc.  A good buy!",1231718400,12,946,4.589285714285714
1993464,3,B0001EK9VK,"You will learn as much as being in an online breakdancing forum for at least an hour a day.

1993467,3,B0001EK9VK,I purchased this video to learn some steps to teach my students at school.  I found the video's quality to be quite low and a little cheesy.  Some of the steps were easy to pick up and others were difficult.  My students got bored watching the movie 5 minutes into it.  The pace was very slow.,1204416000,2,293,4.178571428571429

1993469,5,B0001EK9VK,I've always wanted to learn to breakdance but couldn't find a good source to even learn the basics. Then I found this video and I can actually do some impressive looking tricks after just a week! It breaks down each move over and over from different angles so learning the moves is a breeze.,1202688000,,291,4.407407407407407
1993470,5,B0001EK9VK,"This was the best $20 or so I spent in 2007.
There are lots of instructional dance clips on youtube.  Nonetheless, this DVD set is helpful because it provides a structured set of lessons starting with very simple moves and progressing gradually to more complex material.  Also, the lessons themselves are quite forgiving, breaking down (pardon the pun) each move into a series of discreet, simple components.  For me, this is all important because none of my friends break, so I don't have any personal guide.
Some suggestions to improve the next edition:
(1) After I've completed disk 2, then what?  I'd love a referral to where to go to break.  I live in a NYC suburb, but even the most dance-friendly of the 22 bars and clubs in my home town prohibit breaking, even by 40 year old ivy league lawyers.  Where can I go to show off?
(2) The guys who made this DVD are up to their eyeballs in talent and, perhaps because of this, they sometimes underestimate the beauty of their work and gloss over really, really good stuff without the attention it deserves.  Thus, some of the lessons clearly teach a simple move, then sum up the lesson with a dazzling display of acrobatics which leaves me both inspired and hopelessly confused.  For example, the DVD provides a clear method to learn the New York backspin starting from a baby freeze; the lesson ends with a demonstration - a guy dropping from top-rocking directly into a NY backspin (skipping the baby freeze altogether) and ending the backspin in a chair freeze: absolutely beautiful - and absolutely impossible to replicate, unless you hit the rewind button 10, 20, 30 times or more.",1199145600,2,1638,4.7027972027972025
1993471,4,B0001EK9VK,"This dvd is great at teaching toprock,floats,freezes,drops

I have to admit i had trouble learning how 2 backspin and windmill

1993472,5,B0001EK9VK,"I agree with all the people that gave these DVDs a positive review. I just want to add one piece of information on how the instruction is working:
(1) Unfortunately, the instructors do not hit the beat the way you are supposed to in the instruction parts. Things are sufficiently slow, but especially for beginners, it is important to see how moves and music go together. It seems like the music has been added after the instructions were filmed. When I started out, coordinating music and moves was the single biggest obstacle for me.",1195516800,2,535,4.702127659574468
1993473,5,B0001EK9VK,I worked with this to learn and build a bboy group for my church. it works very well and the instructions are very simple and clear. only in english.,1187136000,,149,4.172413793103448
1993474,1,B0001EK9VK,"This video looks amatuer in the way it was shot. It looks like it was filmed in someone's basement or backyard. Also, the language is so street I barely understood what they were saying (not everybody is a street kid english please!!). Very disappointed and definitley not worth the money!",1178064000,4,289,4.8
1993475,5,B0001EK9VK,"I bought the dvd last year, and I only apologize to the curious possible buyers that it took me so long to get on here and tell you how good the program is. First, the videographers are excellent because when they show the guys dancing, if they're doing a full body dance, they show them head to toe at all times, and whether its the upper body, lower body you ALWAYS know what the dancer is doing which is crucial to learning. Next, it teaches a whole lot of material, street dancing, waves with you body through muscle and joint isolation, the robot, top rocks, advanced/power moves, basic moves, it teaches you everything you need to get your bboy skills goin if you're serious about not only learning to break from a beginners stand point, but also advancing very far. If you master this dvd set you'll rock with anyone out there. Because you'll not only know so many different moves, and aspects of breaking and just street dancing period, that you'll be skilled enough to literally start developing your own style and moves,  as well as to update on present day moves that you see in the coming future. You'll be strong enough, and fast enough in your body, and you're mind will just be in that breaking mode. If there are any moves your seeing from the past two years that arn't on the dvd, it's because the dvd was copyrighted in 2004, but if theres any level you need to get to this dvd will definetely advance you to it beyond measure. I'm glad I bought it, I can't say I regret anything from it. Oh i forgot, it has alot of different guys that brought different aspects to the culture of breaking, and if you like researching the dance, theres some names on here that you might appreciate knowing about. Theres a basic moves dvd in the pack, and an power moves dvd, and theres breaking events that you'll see, and just all these different dudes that'll teach you any and everything.",1176422400,6,1893,4.471098265895954
1993476,5,B0001EK9VK,Actually it is VERY COOL CD i swear it is so clear in everything especially in the accent it is very easy for who don't know a lot in english language & i did a good breaking :P :D WOW i'm now a bboy :D,1175644800,,202,3.511111111111111
1993477,5,B0001EK9VK,This is the best breakdancing video that i have come across. It's step by step instructions. They show you that right way and wrong way of doing moves. BUY IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BREAKDANCE THE RIGHT WAY.,1174694400,2,209,4.25
1993478,3,B0001EK9VK,"i think this dvd is awesome, it's really cool to see those guys breakdance, but it's really not for everybody... if your not in shape you won't be able to do it. it gives me motivation tough.",1174435200,2,191,4.1891891891891895
1993479,5,B0001EK9VK,"It goes slow enough for even the greenest of dancers can catch on. There isn't alot of subjective material in it, meaning they show you the basics and tell you to build your own style off of it. Very easy to understand and follow.",1173830400,2,230,4.25

1993482,5,B0001EK9VK,"One of my favorite things about this dvd is the fact that it is made by ""real"" breakdancers.  These guys know what they are doing and they break it down for you in easy to follow steps.  They also have different dancers showing you how to do the same moves.

Nothing in the reviews indicated a parental advisory, so I thought it would be a good purchase for my nephew for his 7th birthday. Oops!

1993496,3,B0001EK9VK,"Before I saw this video I had never tried any of this.  I went to a ton of raves and did liquid but was always amazed by the break dancing I saw going on.  Based on the reviews here I decided to try this video.

After watching this video about a dozen times I'm only slightly better off than I was.  There is no doubt that these guys are awesome dancers.  They do break down everything into small steps and go over them slowly.  The problem is that I can do every single step that they show slowly but they turn up the speed by ten, put everything together and talk more about style than instructing you through it.

The idea is that they don't want you to copy their style but evolve your own.  I agree with that.  But if you are a novice, like myself, than you want to be walked through one or two full routines so you feel you can move through all the different steps with ease.  Only once I have that down can I begin to modify and add my own style.  If you ever took dance lessons as a kid, you know that is how the professionals teach you.

If you are someone who already can do the basics of beat boy dancing this would be a phenomenal video for you.  However, if you are like me and never tried it before in your life get this video later on.",1118966400,34,1250,4.012145748987854

*the instructors featured are not only top-notch dancers, they are very good teachers with good communication skills; they make this stuff look easy and it is way easier for you after you watch their video; I have literally never seen a teacher of the art form who is half as effective as Zulu Gremlin

*this video is a technical and historical landmark: you can probably learn more of what you want and need to know about B-boying from this video than from any other video in existence; there's a minimum of the usual clowning and posturing BS and lots of authentic history from people you never heard of who laid the cornerstones of the old school; some of them are very insightful dudes you need to hear if you think you already know what real hip hop is and how we got where we are now

*the production quality of the teaching segment is mostly way above average; the battle footage quality is a bit above average but nothing to write your homies about

If you only buy one B-Boy video in your entire life you should buy the Detours video at detoursvideo.com. When viewing Detours be sure to wear a helmet or other protective headgear to catch your mind in when it gets blown. If you only buy two B-Boy videos, Breakdance Step-by-Step should be the second.

Good: This is the best thing I have ever bought it teaches u pretty plain and simple but yet very detailed and clean, I learned the moves pretty fast. I'm 15 years old, showing off at school gets u so much attention. I would say the guy teaching u talks at about a medium pace, not too slow, not too fast. U learn like 30+ moves on this DVD. Its only 27$ free shipping, I would say that's cheap as hell, a lot better than going to a dance school (very very few teach bboying). Impress your friends, maybe even get some girls (I did), hell, do it for a hobby incase u have no life like I used have. This is the Shiz.
Bad: My only gripe about this DVD is that they don't teach 1 move, the Air Flare (it's a power move, pretty much the hardest move, the god of all moves) the only reason I'm saying this is because the DVD has 30+ moves spread across 2 DVDs, why not include just one more move. THIS should definitely not stop u from buying this DVD. U can see what air flares look like on a video clip, if u get as good as me u can just see the move on your screen then go on the floor and do it perfectly. It looks like starting a headspin, put while on a handstand, and flipping off each arm. To see clips of breakdanceing see [...] very nice website, you'll know what air flares r when u see them, trust me.
Peace Yall BuY ThiS,........Latur iwould give this a 12/10 if i could",1081468800,56,2056,4.091584158415841

8011149,3,B0001EK9VK,"this has some great steps and good ideas; however, it'll take a while to get some of the more acrobatic things on here... have plenty of space, and have a partner near by to help with a few of the harder movements to make sure you don't hurt yourself",1361145600,,250,4.122448979591836
