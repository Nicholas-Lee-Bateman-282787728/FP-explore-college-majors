1236366,3,B00000JPGL,"This is admittedly a good war film, probably my favorite from the era of Italian filmmaking before the Spaghetti Western changed everything and all their movies were done in English.  This movie kind of sticks with this later trend with cameos by Peter Falk and Arthur Kennedy (though they are only CAMEOS mind you), but the English dubbing is much worse than usual.  The bulk of the cast is played by fairly anonymous Italian and Russian actors, the scope is grand, but the battle scenes fairly disappointing.  Also the film is annoyingly pro-soviet, especially during the soviet anthem singing scenes and then later with the heroic partisans.

However, this DVD, for all it's expensiveness, is frankly horrible.  It's an obvious transfer from a VHS tape, and from a VCR that had a hard time with the tracking control.  On top of that, there is no menu, and no chapter stops... so to stop watching and start again means you have to sit and FF through the movie as fast as your DVD player will let you.

Hold out and wait for a better version of this little-seen war classic to come out.  In the meantime, dig up the old VHS tape as it's basically the same thing.",1144886400,18,1163,4.584541062801932
1236367,5,B00000JPGL,"i remember watching this movie with my father WAY back in the early 1960,s and i never forgot it. 35 years later i found it was available on the web and bought it immediatley. this film contains some of the most incredible images of the war in russia that youll ever see. im not talking about heavy bloody war scenes like saving private ryan or stalingrad. im talking about an italian soldier who gets shot down in an endless field of sunflowers that seeemed to go on forever as he tries to get close to a russian woman. a scene where two huge armies are facing each other about to go in to battle, a rabbit suddenly runs out on the snowy russian plains between the armies . a russian soldier and an italian soldier chase the rabbit to see who will grab it after it is shot. both armies are cheering theire  soldiers on like its  a footbal match and suddenly an italian soldier shoots and kills the russian. the russians attack with a vengence. an italian soldier and a russian woman in a frozen blizzard landscape. she trying to escape the partisans he trying to get to italy! suddenly like ghosts in the night there are russian soldiers on skis all around them. they hide , they part and later he finds her frozen corpse. look for a very young PETER FALK in his pre columbo days appearing as an italian doctor! unforgettable film photographed at all the actual locations in russia where the battles with the italian army took place. a unique film half italin half russian with 2 american actors ( peter falk and george kennedy)truly one of the oddest films ever made. released in italy as ""ITALIANA BRAVA GENTE"". check this wondeful film out",1063324800,12,1643,4.491638795986622
1236368,5,B00000JPGL,"This is a first-rate movie which portrays the Italian army in Russia fighting for the axis powers.  As an ally of Hitler, Italy had to provide a contingent for his Russian campaign.  This movie provides a fairly honest portrayal of average Italian soldiers caught up in a bad cause.  The acting is good, and the parts played by Peter Faulk and George Kennedy are very interesting.  Faulk plays a wayward Italian doctor, while Kennedy is a fanatical facist officer.  All come to grief in the 1942 Russian counter-offensive outside of Stalingrad which virtually wiped the Italian army corps out, and sealed the fate for the Germany 6th Army in the city itself.  What makes a good WW2 movie in my opinion is not only the subject and storyline, but also the equipment.  There are accurate weapons in this production, including Russian T-34 tanks.  Always a treat to see the real thing!  This is an Italian movie with English dubbing.  As an Italian flick of the 1960s it has some odd moments here and there, and the movies length can be a bit daunting for the faint of heart. Still, the films subject matter and perspective make it unique, and a classic of its kind.  You will find interesting comparisons to the recent German release ""Stalingrad"" which deals with the same time period.  Both of these movies are highly recommneded for the WW2 buff, and for those seeking interesting cinema.",980467200,31,1387,4.7573221757322175

7913158,5,B00000JPGL,"Great movie, as a student of ww2 eastern front, I can't say enough about the movie. I saw this movie on a late movie in 1974, and never saw it again. It shows what can happen to the everyday guy who gets in over his head thanks to his goverment. Peter Falk has a short role as an Italian doctor, Arthur Kennedy plays a hard case black shirt facist officer . We all know what happen to axis forces, so it doesn't end well for anyone in the film. The winter is unreal. I was lucky I got a dvd copy from amazon and it was very good. A more detailed view of the russian front watch or buy the russian mini-series "" Liberation ""  took 3 years to make 1968-1971, you won't be disappointed.",1424131200,,683,4.059259259259259
7913159,5,B00000JPGL,"I saw this movie on tv way ,way back when I was a young boy and it made a deep impression on me because it is the only war film I ever saw about the Italian army on the eastern front. It features massive battle scenes and shows the cruelty of war on the eastern front. I saw the German film ""Stalingrad""but it doesn't measure up to this one in showing both the violence and cruelty of war.""Stalingrad"" seems tamer in the length of battle scenes though it is also very realistic. Perhaps more but showing shorter battle scenes. Please put this one on the dvd format.
Correction the movie ""Sunflower""is also about the Italian army on the Russian front and I saw that one too as a young boy on tv but that one is about a tragic love story set during the war.",1419552000,,755,4.213793103448276
7913160,3,B00000JPGL,Black and white film is good but the story line is off base. The combat pictures and uniforms look really good. This movie makes the russian military seem its on the right side of the campaign from the start. We know now how the russian military was just as ruthless,1396742400,,266,4.34
7913161,4,B00000JPGL,I remember watching this movie as a kid and I finally got a chance to see it again. The most interesting thing about the movie is how the Italian Army's story was told. A true history lesson that often times goes untold.,1396224000,,220,4.261904761904762
7913162,1,B00000JPGL,"Must've been taped off a TV broadcast....Horrific English dubbing, 1:1:33 aspect ratio, grainy, scratched .  Only purchased it because it's the only available print out there...Hope that's corrected....
The sunflower field sequence still amazing though.",1356652800,,253,6.228571428571429
7913163,5,B00000JPGL,"An interesting dvd showing the Italian Army experience during WWII on the Eastern Front. This movie complements the movie Stalingrad, as well as the movie titled Stalingrad, Dogs do you want to live forever. War is hell.",1353715200,,220,4.972972972972973
7913164,4,B00000JPGL,"I saw this movie years ago and was struck by the political sophistication. The singing of the Internationale  (this song is not just the Soviet Anthem, it was the internationalist anthem, sung in many languages all over the world)was a brilliant moment. Two of the Italian soldiers are Internationalists - socialists, and one fought in Spain against the Fascists. He is recognized by a Russian Colonel during a medical truce but has to deny it as he would be be in big trouble with the Fascist army.  The portrayal of the russian prostitutes, the cruel, chaotic retreat during which Italian soldiers are crushed by panicked truck drivers are just not the stuff of any other war movie I have ever seen. If you don't know the history, a lot could go over your head or be mistaken  for Soviet  propaganda, but it is way more sophisticated than that.  Scalding, unforgettable...it ranks with Battle of the Neretva as films that bring you to lesser known but ferocious episodes in the war.",1309996800,5,984,4.764705882352941
7913165,2,B00000JPGL,"This would have been a good movie if they actually showed the reality of the war.  It was good enough to watch at a friend's house and a lot of discussion on the accuracy.  Seriously, this is a movie only a war ""afficionado"" would love.  With ""Enemy at the Gates"", this one qualifies for a remake.",1252540800,,297,4.267857142857143
7913166,3,B00000JPGL,"rarely seen, probably for good reason.
the soviet propaganda will make you barf!
it is interesting only that there isn't any really good movies about the russian front, and this is no exception! for war movie buffs only.
peter falk steals the show and a good performance by george kennedy.
otherwise PU!",1242518400,,303,4.846153846153846
