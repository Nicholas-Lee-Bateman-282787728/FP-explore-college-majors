4184606,5,B003RFC0IU,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Nostalgia Family, all-regions disc. In fact, I don't see the company name anywhere on the disc or cover; I'm going by Amazon's description for the studio/production company name. All that aside, however, this is a great transfer. The black-and-white picture is almost flawless; the audio is perfectly clear. And the story, production, acting and directing are all superb. I had never seen this movie before, but I'm glad that I made the DVD purchase. It is great entertainment and great quality!

I have several British titles on my wish list, and this was one of them. Sadly, it's often hard to find Region 1 versions of the great British films. I hope that we see more and more of them made available to us on this side of the Atlantic.",1444262400,7,777,4.630434782608695

4184608,5,B003RFC0IU,"The ""Third Key"" is actually the US title release for the British detective drama called ""The Long Arm"".  The ""Long Arm"", starring Jack Hawkins is a terrific police procedural from 1956 and was the last production for the famous Ealing Studios.  There is a region ""2"" release of this movie by Optimum Classics.  The Region ""1"" release is by Retroflix--so sometimes you are not sure what you will be getting in terms of image quality.  I already own the Region 2 release and it a a beautiful print, in vitually perfect condition.  I recently picked up a copy of the Region 1, Retroflix version and was stunned to find out that it is of equal quality, image wise to the Optimum version.

So if you love this movie, as I do, and you don't have a mult-region player, take a chance on this.",1296172800,4,784,4.4475524475524475

8403626,4,B003RFC0IU,Terrific British movie from the 50's.  Not the traditional canned screenplay or plot.  Jack Hawkins (the Centurion in Ben Hur) is a convincing and powerful Detective Inspector for New Scotland Yard.  The supporting cast is very good as well.,1494892800,,241,5.128205128205129
8403627,5,B003RFC0IU,"1950's London, shows how crime was solved by sharp investigators before computers. Shows the card index crime files and the leg work to follow up evidence. Great scenes of 1950's London a real plus! Not a bad transfer in  sharp B&W .",1488240000,5,233,4.5476190476190474
