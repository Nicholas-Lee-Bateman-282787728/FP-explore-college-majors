This anime is a MUST have for anyone who likes lesbians and/or craziness.  Personally, I adore both.  There isn't a male character in the entire thing.
The music in this anime plays constantly and changes rarely.  It was just starting to get on my nerves when the anime was over.
If you crave romantic, deep and meaninful storylines, or in-depth characters, and hederosexual relationships... this anime is not for you.

Then, Miyuki fell down the mysterious hole... and so begins this modern day japanese retelling of a timeless european classic. In this version, every charecter is female, and there is plenty of sexual content. However, the show is in fact more funny than offensive. (It was done by CLAMP, an all-female artist team.) Unless you're under 17 or are really easily offended, this is a great one to see. The film gets four stars instead of five only because I'd been kind of wanting to see what direction Miyuki's life would take later on. Then again, perhaps that would have been too dirivetive.

809973,3,6304124120,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1995 Japanese anime...
I started this adventure with a 1903 short of Alice In Wonderland, and have now chronologically arrived in the year 1995 to meet Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland. Wow. The times they are a changin'. This is going to be a short review because so many other folks who know the manga/anime genre far better than myself have posted excellent reviews. Two out of several entries that helped me make sense of what is somewhat unfamiliar territory for me are entitled:

""Miyuki-Chan in Fanservice Reverse-Harem Land!""
""ALICE IN WONDERLAND as metaphor for sexual awakening?""

What can I add? First, I didn't notice anyone comment on the Bill Murray sort of 'Ground Hog Day' theme injected at the end of the story. Poor Miyuki (an adapted Alice voiced by 26 year old Mariko Kouda) wakes up after her harrowing ordeal only to apparently begin it all again. Ouch!

What else? This is another example of an Alice tale not for children. The adult sexual/lesbian theme throughout is simply digested better by a post 15 year old or so person. But if there is any doubt this is a comedic takeoff on AIW, the repeating soundtrack (which I loved) continuously reminds us this is a parody. And a good one. The two vignettes mimicking the two Lewis Carroll Alice books are hilarious. Little Miyuki is so late, so very late... for her very important date (to get to school on time). But, you know...

In previous reviews of Alice videos I've started to delineate ""adaptations"" which attempt to capture the essence of Carroll's words in moving picture form, from the ""interpretations"" which tend to include many of the characters and story line, but embellish on the core work.

Then there are the ""takeoffs"", which are inspired by Alice's adventures, but take a sharp departure from there on out. This production of course falls into that camp. But if you take it in that context, the video can certainly be appreciated. This title also turned me on to CLAMP (tried to google what that stands for but got no results. Is that an acronym?).

If you like parodies of Alice may I recommend the following:

It's nothing more then soft-core porn. Don't get me wrong I like stuff like this but if this film I'm watching has a good story and memorable characters to back it up and this film has neither. The characters are 1D,unlikable,bland and worst of all, forgettable. It's very rush at best in-fact,this film is only 30 minutes long. The ONLY GOOD thing about the movie is the animation is first-rate but even that fails to help it in the long run. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1342051200,,643,4.411764705882353
809975,4,6304124120,"I've wanted this for several years since I first learned of it's existence just because it's paying homage to Alice in Wonderland to which I am a fan of. Upon receiving this DVD, I was met with mixed feelings overall. Since I didn't research it at all, beyond the fact it's like a parody of Alice in Wonderland, I thought it would be more like a movie and have a longer running time than it did.

All the characters are female. Any male characters being gender swapped to the female persuasion. The genre is Comedy, Fantasy, and it boasts Yuri themes (Girl + Girl relationships). With all this innuendo, and women running about, there isn't much in the way of story. So let's dive in and see what this is all about.

!!! [Spoiler Alert] !!!
Miyuki-chan is an ordinary, cute girl that is late for school. On her way out she spots a skateboarding bunny girl and falls into Wonderland. Within Wonderland, she visits the commonplace locals that Alice in Wonderland also visits, as if paying homage to the original story. However, in each successive scene, Miyuki seems to be at a loss as to where she is and wanders around asking everyone ""Where is this?"" or ""Where am I?"" Usually the other female characters never give a strait answer and start to toy with cute little Miyuki-chan. There is absolutely no character development either, and the running time (30 minutes) is rather short as some OAV's / OVA's tend to be.

Miyuki then finds her way back to reality somehow and then delves into Mirror Land. This time she reads a sign that is backwards that says Mirror Land and wanders about as the female denizens grope her and tease her, playing games, etc. Eventually she gets to a chess board to play against herself where the loser must strip naked! There is quite a lot of fanservice, innuendos, and Yuri themes. If you like these kinds of things and want something extremely casual and fun to watch, then more power to you, this might be up your alley.

... [Spoilers End] ...

Overall, I enjoyed the short experience for the most part. However, I wish it was longer, like a movie and to have a bit more character interaction, plot development, and character development while maintaining the themes it prominently displays throughout.

Also note that their is no English Dub, just the original Japanese voices with English subtitles. The same applies to certain other series like Sakura Diaries (Uncut), Card Captor Sakura, and the like.",1333670400,,2439,4.686915887850467
809976,5,6304124120,"Well... Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland is just as it sounds.  It's basically an anime version of Alice in Wonderland with a little bit of twist: it's all female.  It's a trippie, psychedelic world with yuri overtones that's just absolutely ridiculous, but in a good way.  I would not recommend this to anyone that's shy to ecchi anime but it is not, I repeat, NOT a hentai.  At best I would recommend a minimum age of fourteen/fifteen to view, but use you best judgment (there are more adult animes out there).  There are really only two episodes: Wonderland and its sequel Mirrorland.  The anime's great if you really love anime like I do and okay if you have forty-five minutes to an hour to kill to not only watch the show but explore trailers and other options on the disk.  There's really no plot to give away since each episode is separate from one another.  If you've read the real Alice or seen any of the film adaptations, you can guess the next scene, plus or minus a thing or so.  It's just a little more sexy and interesting, that's all.  But like I said this is an amine for people that really like the genre and are aware of those little obscure and silly animes that will most likely remain OVAs.  As a starter anime to new people - no, but for experienced - well you get the idea.",1269302400,,1291,4.382352941176471

809978,1,6304124120,"I'm not just giving this one star because I didn't like it, but because I found it to be a poor DVD all around. You don't even get to see those cute bunnies on the cover!

This DVD was purchased because I am largely an anime fan as well and an enjoyer of the Alice in Wonderland story. This movie failed me on both levels. Even it was cast with all live supermodels, it would still be worse then watching a Girls Gone Wild commercial. The animation was far from anything high quality, the entire soundtrack was basicly one repetive song that reminds me of one of those benny hill skits where they speed everything up and even though I don't like fan service in my anime, this was still lacking in that department as well. There is no payoff either to this sexual fantasy. As soon as alice even gets close ""getting good"" Miyuki runs off to the tone of that annoying song just to run away from the next batch of seducers.

The only cool aspect of this movie, and it wasn't even that cool...more of a ""this doesn't suck that much"" was the lyrics to the ending credits (because of the translation as well as the japanese words spelled out in english) and the landscape of mirrorland.

I prefer action in my anime, this has none. Wasn't good enough for adult anime, but had too many sexual tones to be a childrens story either. This was a poor sexual story as well as a poor alice in wonderland story.

if you DO like the alice in wonderland story, I would suggest not purchasing this film, as it might leave you feeling that the story was raped by this film.

809979,3,6304124120,"Not quite right is the best way to summarize this. This at best should have been a bonus on a regular DVD show, not its own.

Visuals:

Mostly eye candy. The characters are well drawn, but sort of cookie cutter style.

Backgrounds were adequate, and the colors were acceptable.

Sound:

Music was annoying. It was an alright tune at first, but the little jingle plays the entire 30 minutes of the film with very minute variations.

The rest of the sound effects were alright, nothing stunning but nothing un-acceptable.

Story:

Extremely scarce. Basically take Alice in Wonderland, convert the characters to licentious women, lop off 99% of any story line and you'd still have more story than this. It has a split second start, and then the rest is hastily slapped together moments of women hitting on the lead character. This story could have been so much more, but I have a feeling that it was low budget.

High points:

Beautiful kinky women, Nice looking scenery, and I love watching how scared straight women act when hit on.

I recommend buying it. It isn't completely worth the money. Its' sort of like paying full book price for a pamphlet, BUT! This show seems to have promise and maybe decent sales might prompt them to release something more tolerable.",1152144000,,1264,4.752293577981652

Don't get me wrong it wasn't totally bad, but it may have been better if only of these women actually did something to her.  As it is, it seems silly that the title character gets so worked up when nothing has been done to her.  Or maybe thats the point, when her copy takes off its clothing, she gets so anxious because this clone of her is actually playing out desires that she is afraid to admit to herself, specifically a need to be an exhibitionist, to be loved by other women, and to feel pleasure.  This is the most plausible explanation to why she keeps having these fantasies; sure, you could argue that Miyuki is the victim of this world, but the real reason is that she actually want this. Sadly, the real Miyuki never receives anything but a tease from all these women.",1143763200,2,866,4.427672955974843

  Clamp, the renowned all-female studio that created the anime, draws on some of the unconscious concerns of its young ""shoujo"" audience for the humor and fascination.

  Miyuki, the heroine of the story, who can't help but enjoy her fetching appearance while she sits and combs her beautiful hair in front of the mirror, must know that while she is still partly a child she cannot remain that way for long.  In her trip to Wonderland she encounters the somewhat grotesque caricatures of female seductiveness that are among the inhabitants of popular culture, such as girls in bunny suits and cat outfits.  That they try to seduce her might be symbolic of her fears of what she might herself have to become.

  In the second segment, the trip to Mirrorland, it is Miyuki's own reflection that pulls her in, making the confrontation all the more direct.  Seeing how quickly and shamlessly her mirror-double is willing to strip naked embarrasses Miyuki to the point that she must flee, even though it is, after all, only in front of other women.

810017,3,6304124120,"I kept hearing about this anime from the all-female CLAMP manga collective, so I bought the DVD (which also includes MIYUKI-CHAN IN MIRRORLAND, or ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS). The limited story of both short films (actually just a series of strange events) is of a Japanese schoolgirl, Miyuki, who first disappears down an interdimensional ""rabbit hole"" along with a PLAYBOY bunny type ""white rabbit"", then meets a series of all-female characters in fetishy garb based on the characters in ALICE IN WONDERLAND. All these characters seem to want to fondle, kiss or sexually dominate Miyuki, who just gets embarrassed, runs off and falls into the next batch of supernatural lesbians who invite her to ""come play with us"". MIYUKI-CHAN IN MIRRORLAND repeats this trend - except here Miyuki is pulled through her bedroom mirror by a more sexually knowing version of herself, who touches her in an intimate (but non-explicit - so stop drooling, *Okatu-San*!) manner.
The entire tone of the first production is more cute-comical than menacing (even the whip-wielding Red Queen who restrains Miyuki with her bullwhip never actually flogs her), and Miyuki's greatest fear is being embarrassed by all this free-floating feminine touching and snuggling. The second has a bit more edge to it, as the chess game Miyuki plays with her mirror self has living female pieces who whip each other into (again, non-explicit) nudity, and the loser of the game has to strip (which mirror-Miyuki does willingly as our Miyuki looks really, REALLY embarrassed and tries to get her to stop, screaming ""But I'm not married yet!"" in the English - subtitled only - translation.) Even so, this is as far removed from hardcore BDSM tentacle *hentai* on the order of Maeda's UROTSUKIDOJI (""Overfiend"") Saga or Pink Pineapple's ANGEL OF DARKNESS as an episode of Saturday morning's CARDCAPTORS (also created by CLAMP, incidentially).
Depending on which theory you read, Carroll's ALICE books are either a satire of British politics of the time, or a metaphor for a young girl's sexual awakening. CLAMP seems to have gone full-bore for this second interpretation in their story - all the characters except the easily-embarrassed Miyuki are dressed in a sexually provocative fashion, most make seductive advances towards her, and mirror-Miyuki in ...MIRRORLAND is not only willing, but eager to shed her Japanese schoolgirl outfit and stand proudly naked before her other self.
Complicating this, at least to a Western audience, is that all these characters appear to be cliche'd predatory lesbians; however, as Schodt pointed out in his book MANGA! MANGA!, men are often shown in Japanese popular culture as sexually brutal and beastly, whereas women (even sexually active ones) are seen as infinitely more gentle. To the Japanese female fans of CLAMP's work, even the whip-wielding Red (Bondage) Queen would be a gentler, safer introduction into the mysteries of adult sexuality than any man would have been. Miyuki might be embarrassed by all this sex, but she won't be terrified of it coming from other women.
This is the kind of short, slightly-kinky but clearly female-oriented *anime* that you might want to show to any women friends who are under the impression that ""all those Japanese cartoons are nothing but S-M porno and big robots."" (Though I'd like to know what's wrong with big robots, anyway.... Gekiganger - STRIKE! <g>)",1033689600,17,3408,5.153429602888087

As such, there is plenty of male-/lesbian-oriented fan service; those offended by scantily-clad females and the like should probably avoid this title.
There are some perhaps-unintended links to other anime series.  Bunny girls pop up across a lot of anime series.  The card girls are particularly reminiscent of the main warriors of Wild Cardz.  The way some characters are drawn seem to harken to other CLAMP characters, albeit just slightly.
The main drawback to Miyuki-chan in Wonderland is that it is incredibly short - only about thirty minutes total.  It would have been nice if the DVD offered some good extras, but all there is here is scene selection and trailers for other ADV Films offerings :-(  Also, the music is incessantly repetitive, to the point that it becomes annoying on the level of ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" by the end of the thirty minutes!!!  Still, [...] it is hard to go wrong buying this hilarious PS2-compatible DVD :-)",1024099200,8,1196,4.91542288557214

7864895,4,6304124120,"CLAMP, the creative team behind RG Veda, are back with two Wonderland-esque stories told in a manner that suggests that the story could continue on and on forever. There's some fan service - suggestive dialog, suggestive situations, panty shots and some bare skin, but, nothing too objectionable. Although there are no naughty bits in the show and some of the more over-the-top elements are really quite tame by today's standards, given the degree of fan service, the youngest anime fans among us should probably stay away. Miyuki-Chan is an older title and does exhibit some signs of its age in the way it looks and feels, but, it has held up very well over the years and is still well worth a peek. This title is out of print at the time of this writing, but, if you can find it relatively cheap, it is certainly something you should consider having in your anime collection.",1421884800,,877,4.664516129032258

7864900,4,6304124120,"Miyuki is your average Coquettish young maiden who just wants to make it to school ontime. sadly, her subconcious won't let her.
at least they won't if the ladies of CLAMP have their way.
seriously though, this is a cute little fanservice romp, and while the art may be it a little risque' its nothing worse than what  you might see on the TV. Long story short, this is clamps little foray into video game parody (Nanase Okawa, their main writer at the time, was a huge fan of Eroge-type games and had a collection of more than 150 different ones at the time this  story was created). there is an oversized art-comic which continues the theme (Miyuki gets a job, she falls asleep watching Barbarella, playing mah-jong, and the final story where she takes the place of the lead protagonist of their series X). this show however, just focuses on Wonderland and Mirrorland and is meant to be a fun little piece.
the first part - Miyuki in Wonderland finds our distressed Heroine running late, untill a skateboard riding bunny-girl creates a portal that drops the poor girl into wonderland, and after encountering the denizens she learns that they either want to fight her or undress her! and just when she thinks she's safe, the whole cycle starts all over for her.
the second part - Miyuki in Mirrorland - is meant as a fun romp through the looking glass, especially when her own reflection tries to seduce her. she's pulled into the mirror realm where all manner of lovelies await our heroine (including the sexiest Jabberwocky ever) and her ultimate fate is *gasp* tied to a strip chess-match!
the show is a fun look into this poor girls sub-concious and with the way both episodes end, you have to wonder if she's even aware that events keep looping around her.
the other thing about the series is that even though its been years since ive seen it, i STILL find the bgm to be extremely catchy and fun, and even the closing song (about a girl who's cheating with her best friends boyfriend and the all importance of love over friendship) is still an earhook.",1392422400,,2058,4.604904632152588
