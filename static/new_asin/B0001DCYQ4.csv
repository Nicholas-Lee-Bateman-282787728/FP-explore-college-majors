8010363,5,B0001DCYQ4,"Kennywood Memories is a great documentary about one of the most historic and traditional theme parks in the United States.  It truly goes into depth on the park's rich history and roots, and why it's so appealing to a massive audience.  Being from Pittsburgh myself, I can say that it truly made me nostalgic and made me want to go to Kennywood right away!",1356652800,,356,4.546875
8010364,5,B0001DCYQ4,"What a great video.  A trip into the past, beautiful nostalgia and big smiles everywhere.  Full of vintage footage of the park, old photos, interviews with people who were there and lots of current (1989) filming of the park as it stands.  Great for anyone into old rides, games, carnivals, theme parks, amusement parks, trolley parks, etc.  Balanced coverage of all the rides, including the kiddie rides which most books and videos tend to discount.  Well done Rick and crew!  Highest recommendation.",1235174400,3,501,5.048780487804878
8010365,5,B0001DCYQ4,"I LOVE Kennywood Memories.  I used to watch this all the time growing up between yearly trips to Kennywood.  I nearly have it memorized.  Rick definitely does an excellent job narrating just as he does on all the Pittsburgh History Series videos.  The film basically runs you through a day at Kennwood, starting from sunrise to closing time.  Lots of park history is very neatly sewn in to give you a taste of Kennywood through the decades.  Even though its been 8 years since I've been, this film can make it feel like you're right there about to jump on the Thunderbolt or munching on fries from the Potato Patch.  If you've ever been to Kennywood, you need this!",1214524800,2,665,4.53781512605042
8010366,4,B0001DCYQ4,"I first went to Kennywood in 1952 and have continued to go when in Pittsburgh over the past 55 years.  This DVD is special because it contains so many film clips from the past of the various rides, the ethnic events there such as ""Italian day"" and the old commercials that people of my era can all relate to.  I first saw the show on PBS in Houston, Texas in the late 90's and enjoyed it so much that I made myself a video tape.  The DVD is even better as it contains many extras to enhance the memory experience.",1213660800,,513,4.11
8010367,5,B0001DCYQ4,"The first time, that I saw Kennywood Memories, was on tv, on Pittsburgh's PBS station, WQED. Then, when Kennywood Memories came out on VHS, I immediately bought the tape. Then, Kennywood Memories was released on DVD, with alot of neat extras. I also immediately bought the DVD version as well. Kennywood Memories, is a superb documentary, about a great, great old amusement park, located in the borough of West Mifflin,PA., in the Pittsburgh,PA. area. Rick Sebak, is superb at the work that he does, on any of his documentaries, on historic places, in and around, the Pittsburgh,PA. area. Anyone who loves Kennywood, will thoroughly enjoy watching this excellent documentary, on Kennywood. I highly recommend the DVD version, over the VHS version.",1171238400,7,747,5.181818181818182
8010368,5,B0001DCYQ4,Rick Sebak is a master at documentaries. You will not be disappointed with this entry. I bought the vhs when it first came out and this dvd is exceptional because of the bonus material. Any fan of Kennywood has to have this dvd and I strongly urge Mr. Sebak and/or WQED to consider a sequel to catch up on the advances in the park. Thanks for a great documentary on this marvelous amusement park and hope to see more in the future.,1084924800,13,431,4.2682926829268295
