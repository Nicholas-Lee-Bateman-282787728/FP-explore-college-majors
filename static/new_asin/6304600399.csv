907683,5,6304600399,"More than a century ago New Zealand, or Aotearoa as the Maori people call it, went through the Maori Wars when the British authority attempted to enforce its control there.  New Zealand was and still is the only former British colony taken by treaty and not by force.  The story is about the Maori people and their plight for justice in an Imperial system.  Its about honour and the preservation of traditional ways of life.  Although the characters are largely ficticious there is no ficticous dipiction of traditional hakas or the subtitled sections of Maori language.  Anyone who can understand the point of view of native peoples wishing to preserve their society will find merit in this film.

From a cinematic perspective, its an old film.  Some of the scene  transitions might not make sense to persons who have not spent much time in New Zealand or among Maori.  Understand that the term Utu translates to ""consequences"".  But it means more the consequences of your specific actions.

I lived there for a fair spell of time.  The Maori are a noble if not troubled people there on the edge of the world.

Utu is an incredible film which captures the spirit and the power of the Maori people.  Frankly, they are the best people in New Zealand if not the South Pacific.",1139097600,4,1274,4.68018018018018
907684,5,6304600399,"This film on the surface is a tale of an episode in the Maori Wars in New Zealand in the 1870's in which a Maori scout - Te Wheke - turns 'renegade'. Te Wheke embarks upon a vengeance raid after the murder of his family by the colonial troops he has been serving with. The film weaves an intricate web of relationships between complex and intelligently scripted characters that are set within an equally complex society in which two conflicting cultures are alternately accommodating and warring with each other and among themselves. I had to watch this film several times before I really began to appreciate it and understand what it was about....and I'm glad I had the patience. Essentially the film explores the whole concept of vengeance - the meaning of 'utu'. The film depicts how the innocent pay the price for the wrong doings of others, how the wronged become the perpetrators of acts of violence against the innocent and ultimately how the notion of vengeance spires out of control and everyone is sucked into the cycle. The beautiful yet tragically sad ending does not shy away from the awful truth about the only way in which the vengeance cycle can end. A great church scene in the early part of the film, an interesting concept on the use of the bible....and what an outfit. A fantastic film! --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.",1133568000,,1382,4.668032786885246
907685,4,6304600399,"Based on a true account of the Maori uprising of 1870, 'Utu' posits the often asked and all important question ""Who are the savages amongst us?"" In this particular case is it the native Maori of New Zealand who dared defy British occupation and rule, or was it English arrogance and total lack of concern for the native culture that brought about the eventual end of British Colonialism in the area?

Brutal, violent, uncompromising, yet at the same time it contains moments of unexpected humor. Another great film in a long line of movies to come out of Australia and New Zealand. Unforgetable performances by Anzac Wallace as the rebellious Te Wheke and Bruno Lawrence as the white settler obsessed with avenging his wife's death.

Some lessons are never learned. Savages come in all forms, colors and disguises.",1128211200,7,814,4.891304347826087
907686,5,6304600399,"The conflicts of the indigenous peoples of Australia and New Zealand are often eclipsed by the conflict of Native Americans against the U.S. government. Utu offers an insightful snapshot into the conflict many of the New Zealand Maori felt against the encrouching culture of the English. The film showed that even those Maori who aided the English struggled inside to keep their cultural identity from being pulled into the undertoe of English colonialism.

The film serves up a good course of action, especially with the double barrelled shotgun scene. I highly recommend this film because it vividly presents the conflict between colonial powers and indigenous peoples. This film is ""Last of the Mohicans"" in a New Zealand context.",1051056000,18,733,5.211864406779661

907688,5,6304600399,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the early 1980s, and a recent reviewing confirmed its brilliance. The subject matter is unique, a Maori uprising against Europeans in 19th century New Zealand. But what makes the movie worth watching are the performances. Several of the performers stand out, but especially Bruno Lawrence, who I have long considered one of the great underrated actors of the past twenty years. He has never gotten the kinds of rolls that I believe he deserved, but his work in this film as the settler bent on revenge for the loss of all he loved is stunning, as was his work in the films THE QUIET EARTH and SMASH PALACE.  I was baffled when this movie came out that it didn't make a bigger splash than it did, and I have remained amazed that so few people seem to know about it.
Anyone who enjoys any Australian or New Zealand film should definitely seek this move out. Just an outstanding film.",1022716800,12,924,4.4674556213017755
907689,5,6304600399,"This is a beautiful film. It is fiction, but an accurate portrayal of the sort of thing that went on in the 1850's when the Maori tribes were attempting to get their own land back from the British. There is some violence but it is necessary to the story and not excessive. The country is achingly beautiful, the performances are perfect, the music is haunting. Utu is unforgettable.",1014336000,8,382,4.632352941176471
907690,3,6304600399,"Leonard Maltin's characterizing this film as ""dull""  leads me to question whether he's actually seen it. In fact, it's a remarkable piece of work with powerful performances.  ""Sometimes I'm mad ... sometimes I'm not!""",990057600,4,217,5.352941176470588
907691,5,6304600399,"Set during the Maori Wars in New Zealand, this movie is a powerful examination of the damage revenge does. Nothing is cut and dried, and it demands a lot from viewers, but in the end it rewards with a new perception  about the difference between justice and vengence. See it, if for no other  reason than it is one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen.",961113600,10,365,4.352941176470588
7875541,5,6304600399,"I saw this when it came out and over the last 10-years have tried to get a DVD of this. That a film this good, on so many levels, is not readily available is suspicious. Sure, I saw one for $130 somewhere but really? Are there technical reasons, financing reasons, political reasons? That last one makes some sense. Don't know why, but in a capitalistic market, supply comes a little closer to demand. Don't want to go on a rant, so in closing this in one of the 5 films one should see in their life.",1497225600,,500,4.21875

7875546,5,6304600399,"Having studied with my senior English class ""The Greenstone Door"", a novel set in New Zealand's early colonial history,this film was the closest I could provide to a visual setting for these turbulent times. It has a setting and plot which balances sympathetically the tribulations the early settlers faced  with the frustrations and cultural adjustments the Maori had to suffer. We enjoyed it from an academic as well as an entertainment point of view. I was amazed it took me so long to track down a copy. Thank you Amazon.",1308614400,,525,4.833333333333333

7875548,5,6304600399,"Utu is a film that deserves to be better known. The acting is excellent, the story very compelling, and the eerie score supports the visuals well. The story of a Maori uprising against the British army quickly has the viewer rooting for the underdog. The fact that some soldiers are Maori, and others born in New Zealand, casts doubt on their allegiances. There are some excellent battle scenes, as well as strong emotions from some powerful speeches. This film leaves the viewer with a lasting impression the way Once Were Warriers does.",1297296000,,538,4.858695652173913

7875550,4,6304600399,"Utu - Maori for `Blood for Blood' - is almost a great film. It's certainly a terrific `Western,' even if it is set in New Zealand in 1870. It's a Maori version of any number of Westerns where Geronimo jumps the reservation and starts a private war, with Anzac Wallace's army tracker Te Wheke deserting when he finds the British Army have destroyed his peaceful village and seeking revenge on all the `Pakehas.' As his guerrilla war continues, more and more Maori soldiers desert to Te Wheke's cause (not always welcome, either), preconceived notions of right and wrong are challenged as alliances and agendas shift until nobody's hands are clean.

Director and co-writer Geoff Murphy really knows how to use the camera to best effect and uses the landscape superbly, capturing the wet humid feel of a country at once half-built and already decaying, but more than that he tells a great story with some terrific scenes that hark back to a style of classic but morally complex storytelling that went out of fashion in the late 60s and early 70s. There's also a level of savagery that's long been lost in American cinema - not only does he hang the verger from bell rope but he also hacks off the head of the vicar in front of his congregation and then delivers a sermon of his own with the head resting beside him on the pulpit. The action scenes are superbly handled, at once brutally realistic and engrossing. Unfortunately he miscalculates with Bruno Lawrence's initially intriguing settler seeking revenge of his own, overplaying the comedy in his madness. It's not enough to overbalance the film but it does undermine the character, and it's often unnecessary in a film which has a lot of dry wit in the script already.

Sadly the DVD copy is pretty disgraceful, a real pity for a film that looks this good.",1147046400,3,1810,4.7066246056782335
