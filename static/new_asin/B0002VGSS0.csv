8033116,3,B0002VGSS0,"You couldn't go wrong making a film that's true to a James Thurber story, could you? Well, no, but that doesn't mean the movie would be particularly interesting or entertaining. Once we got over the initial laugh about a world class aviator who sounds and acts like a redneck, where does one go from there? There is one major surprise toward the end, but it's neither funny nor flattering to the establishment that runs things. And this is it. 3 stars",1477094400,2,451,4.580246913580247
8033117,5,B0002VGSS0,"Excellent production of the James Thurber story ""The Greatest Man in the World."" Thurber wondered what would happen if a hero came along who wasn't exactly heroic, and refused to be molded into the country's idea of what a hero should be. The quality of the film is a bit poor, but the production closely follows Thurber's story, and brings it wonderfully to life. Brad Davis does an incredible job as Jack Smurch, and Carol Kane is also excellent as Smurch's Sweet Patootie.  While Thurber is mostly remembered for ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" he wrote many other great works. This one was one of my favorites, and it was brought to life in a well-cast, well done fashion. I'm glad to see it is now available on DVD.",1461974400,4,723,4.561538461538461
8033118,5,B0002VGSS0,Excellent Satire on Heroes.  Well Done. The hero was not what the establishment wanted. They tried to remake him into their image of a hero. Very Funny.,1360368000,3,152,4.62962962962963
8033119,5,B0002VGSS0,I taught these stories for years in high school using some of these videos and am now assembling a video library for my son.  Not high def but great stories well told.,1268784000,3,167,4.21875
