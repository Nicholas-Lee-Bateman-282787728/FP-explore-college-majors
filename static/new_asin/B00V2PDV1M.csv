7076208,5,B00V2PDV1M,This is an excellent Spanish program! The video quality is great and the storyline is funny and engaging. My kids learned so fast and actually enjoyed it (something I cannot say for ANY other foreign language program we've tried). Great for children of all ages!,1451433600,4,262,4.844444444444444
7076209,5,B00V2PDV1M,This series of Spanish videos are the best. I hope they produce many more.,1435017600,6,74,4.357142857142857
8708952,5,B00V2PDV1M,"My teen daughter is not a big fan of school and learning language. I am French and my daughter speaks French but it has not been an easy process with her. We have had some opportunities to travel to Central America with my husband's work and we thought we should all learn some Spanish. Plus, it's useful here too. We decided to try these videos even though they are ""for kids"" because my husband and I liked the demo we saw. We all have loved these! Even my hard to please daughter. They are cute, funny and we remember the Spanish, which I find amazing. This is an easier and pleasant way to learn Spanish, at least for our family.",1491868800,3,633,4.283333333333333
8708953,5,B00V2PDV1M,"BEST foreign language DVD series for kids we've ever bought.  My daughter absolutely loves it.  She actually plays it herself without me even asking her to do it. It was so easy for her to learn from it because of the way it uses other children in real life situations while they speak only Spanish on screen. It's like enrolling her in an expensive foreign language immersion school with a video instead! The company says they are working on a Mandarin series and I can't wait to start getting her that series, as well. Yes... the DVD's are expensive. That's the only negative I have.  I wish that weren't the case. Other than that.. we are glad we discovered this foreign language series.",1491004800,2,690,4.59349593495935
8708954,4,B00V2PDV1M,I WIsh there was English words to correspond.  But we will see how it works for us in a month,1485993600,2,93,3.65
8708955,5,B00V2PDV1M,"Absolutely amazing and I would recommend to everyone who would like to learn Spanish- both children and adults.
Both my children and I have learnt so much without even realising we are learning and the knowledge seems to be really absorbed rather than just remembered.
It is also very good value for money as there is a really good amount of content and videos that can be watched repeated without getting bored.
Cannot recommend highly enough!",1484352000,,444,4.855263157894737
8708956,5,B00V2PDV1M,"Our family felt a little sad when we finished this series. It was fun to watch and we can't believe how much we learned and how easy it was. Each time we started a new video, at first it seemed like it may be somewhat difficult. But every time we watched again, it got a little easier and after awhile we couldn't believe we ever thought it was hard at all. We hope more will be made soon.",1478822400,3,389,4.0
8708957,2,B00V2PDV1M,"Too short, not enough lesson, bored easily. Would not recommend unless child under 5.",1476489600,,85,5.142857142857143
8708958,5,B00V2PDV1M,"I studied Spanish all through High School and College. It was always a desire of mine to have our children as passionate about languages as I am. After looking and using other programs, we were very exited to find a program that brought real life conversation alive in a way that made our kids say, 'Can we watch Spanish?' on a Saturday!! That's how you know a learning aide is worth it's weight in Spanish Gold. Thank you for creating a product we can use and enjoy!",1471478400,,467,4.379310344827586
8708959,5,B00V2PDV1M,"This language software is hands-down the best I've seen. We used the online version to prepare our boys for our move to Spain. The concept is clever, as the story lines are captivating in and of themselves, and all the kids are cute. Even though it was challenging, often I found our 8 year old logging on by himself and watching. That ordinarily doesn't happen with foreign languages, in my experience. The Spanish is South American and a bit different than the castellano spoken here in Madrid, but it wasn't a problem for them to learn basic conversational skills. The program definitely gave them a head start.",1470441600,2,614,4.747663551401869
8708960,5,B00V2PDV1M,"I LOVE IT.
I have been looking for something like this for a long time.
I love that the idea ""kids teaching kids through a story""
For my experience teaching Spanish I know how important is to have fun in class.
I also love the story and every lesson is the continuation of the previous lesson.
I recommend it.",1468368000,,309,4.254237288135593
8708961,1,B00V2PDV1M,This is a bootleg knock off.  Doesn't even work on my dvd player.  I will be looking into a refund,1457568000,4,98,3.85
