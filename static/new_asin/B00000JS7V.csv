7913975,5,B00000JS7V,"""Where Is Everybody?"" is the title of the first TWILIGHT ZONE episode ever made; but the question is also asked by the protagonists of ""Time Enough At Last"" and ""The After Hours.""  ""Time Enough at Last"" stars Burgess Meredith as a bookish bank teller named Henry Bemis.  Scolded by his boss and his wife for being ""a reader,"" Bemis retires to the bank's vault each day during his lunch hour to indulge his passion.  One day while he is reading in the vault, a nuclear explosion occurs and the earth is turned into a wasteland.  Stumbling upon the remains of a public library, Bemis declares that now he has all the time in the world to read - but does he really?  Rod Serling's script for ""Time Enough at Last"" is whimsical though ultimately tragic, with similarities to both ""The Obsolete Man"" (also with Meredith) and ""The Lonely.""

Imagine entering a department store with the intention of buying a small item - like a gold thimble.  You are beckoned to by an elevator operator and let off at the store's ninth floor - only to discover that the entire floor is dimly lit and deserted save for a smug saleslady and a single gold thimble.  Later, you learn that the store has no ninth floor, and that the saleslady who waited on you is actually a mannequin!  This is what happens to Marsha White (Anne Francis) in Serling's uncanny ""The After Hours.""  A particularly notable quality of this episode is the absence, for long stretches, of music or dialogue - apt for this tale of a woman who finds herself alone in an empty, darkened store, with only mannequins for company.  In my opinion, the essential theme of ""The After Hours"" is that of running from or ignoring one's true self.",1109980800,,1684,4.561461794019934
7913976,5,B00000JS7V,"`THE AFTER HOURS' remains just as fresh and effective as when it was first aired on June 10, 1960 and its lingering haunting imagery remains engraved into one's subconscious. Who can ever forget Anne Francis as Marsha. Her impeccable performance and exquisite face are indelible. ""Marsha"" that very name and the way it was repeated over and over was so eerily unsettling sending chills down one's spine. This episode when compared to `WALKING DISTANCE' demonstrates the great versatility of Rod Serling as a writer. `WALKING DISTANCE' is probably the best prose that Serling ever penned where every bit of dialogue was so heartfelt and moving. In `THE AFTER HOURS' Serling gives us a more visual tale where the storytelling is more dependent on the images. Serling gives us a story of two strikingly opposite worlds that co-exist within a department store. The vivid contrast and the realistic depiction of those two worlds is at the core of this story that has a strange tinge of melancholy about it. Thanks to effective lighting, production design, photography, Douglas Heyes' Direction and impeccable acting it succeeds on all levels and is one of the definitive episodes of the series. In `TIME ENOUGH AT LAST' a bank teller brilliantly played by Burgess Meredith is a man whose nearsighted-ness is only matched by his preoccupation with reading. Becoming the only survivor of a devastating H-bomb catastrophe he is finally able to pursue his only real passion in life: reading and then more reading. Rod Serling's story interestingly juxtaposes the ultra-introverted world that Burgess Meredith has created for himself with a New World truly void of those human interruptions that would otherwise interrupt his self-imposed solitude. Due to a twist of fate however, the viewer must ponder how will he ever survive? `TIME ENOUGH AT LAST' first aired on November 20, 1959.",1020816000,,1875,5.130718954248366
7913977,4,B00000JS7V,"Making its debut on home video is the classic THE AFTER HOURS, which stars Anne Francis as a young woman shopping in a seemingly normal department store.  After being locked in accidentally after closing time, the girl, Marsha, is visited by some strangely familiar mannequins.
'TIME ENOUGH AT LAST' has Henry Bemis (Burgess Meredith) survive a H-Bomb that destroys civilisation and he the only survivor.
Truly mesmerising stuff.",969667200,4,429,5.3088235294117645
7913978,4,B00000JS7V,"""The After Hours"" is a Serling gem, better yet a sterling gem. Anne Francis is terrific and the plot always seems to surprise. Brugess  Meredith has HIS FINEST role in ""Time Enough at Last,"" the most  twisted, ingenious, and remarkably unforgettable episode produced for the  show. Like ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""The Outer  Limits,"" Serling's series will remain a landmark on the history of  television.",969408000,2,410,5.246153846153846
