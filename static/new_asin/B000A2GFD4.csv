8072439,3,B000A2GFD4,"They had enough material to make three DVDs.  Unfortunately, they decided to make six.  There are times when a problem is started on one DVD and then actually solved on the next.  In fact, the entire problem solving sequence is repeated on the next disc.  The Standard Deviants are wonderful.  The person who edited the DVDs is out to make money.  Here's a suggestion: re-issue the disks.  One on linear ODEs, one on 2nd-order ODEs and one on higher order ODEs.  I'd like half my money back, please.",1151193600,,499,4.590909090909091
