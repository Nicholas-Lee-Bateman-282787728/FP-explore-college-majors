8363493,5,B002C7MX2M,"This film is not about a national park or wild landscape which is the subject of most Finley-Holiday films, but about a fantastic railway and the amazing countryside it passes through. The idea of setting out from a station ""in town"" and climbing thousands of feet to a high place in the snow (except in the late summer months obviously) with panoramic views, really appeals to me and this film gives you a generous number of views all the way from the station to the summit of 14,110 foot high Pikes Peak.

The film is superbly photographed in high definition with excellent music and narration and features views in all the seasons. It looks like a real challenge to keep the railway open when deep snow covers the mountain! There are fascinating clips on track and train maintenance and I especially enjoyed the wonderful views of the train climbing its way up the mountain with Colorado Springs or the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop.

The return trip takes around 3 hours 10 minutes and should I ever have the chance to return to Colorado, I would definitely make a point of doing it.

This is a fascinating DVD and I would recommend it to people who want a really nice souvenir of their trip or to those simply interested in the subject.",1344384000,,1241,4.581081081081081
