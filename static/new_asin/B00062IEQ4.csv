8036940,1,B00062IEQ4,"Wildly out-of-tune singing, sometimes wandering a whole step sharp; inaccurate rhythms put singers far from the beat; tempi consistently rushed; chorus singing in Russian while soloists sing in heavily accented Italian; many other musical and vocal reservations; inscrutible intertitles, and almost half the screen taken by subtitles in Prologo -- then no subtitles for the rest of the film.  There are better performances of this opera to be seen yearly in just about every major city.",1179187200,7,486,5.394736842105263
8036941,4,B00062IEQ4,"I've always appreciated the talents of opera performers and this showcases the performers abilities very well.  This is the first opera I've ever owned and while I don't understand the words, (no subtitles... a disappointment) I appreciate the style of the acting.  ""Vesti la giubba"" gives me chills every time I listen to it.

One reviewer commented on Atlantov's ""snarling"" saying it made it hard to sympathize with Canio.  My question to her is, ""How would any man feel upon realizing his wife were cheating on him?""  I think Atlantov's performance of ""vesti la giubba"" is the best I've seen.  He shows heartache mixed with the anger that Canio must feel since his decision is to kill.  Atlantov's acting and singing are dead on from ""Recitar!"" to ""il cor"".  The snarls arise from the contempt Canio has for the fact that he must, ""Laugh, clown"" and perform for the audience to ""applaud"" while his heart is breaking.  While we can sympathize with his plight, Canio takes a leap that few people would take.  Many people have had their heart broken without resorting to violence, so maybe the ""bleak""ness of the set is appropriate since the story itself is bleak in the sense that it is not hopeful or encouraging.  It is quite tragic.

Atlantov's performance of ""vesti la giubba"" is now my measuring stick for all performances of this aria.  While the stage is rather barren, I feel it takes nothing away from the performance itself.  Sometimes the actors can be pushed to greater limits when there are less distractions around them and they are even moreso the center of attention.  I would have given 5 stars if it would have had subtitles, but I find that the lack thereof has been a benefit since I have aquired an interest in the Italian language.",1166745600,6,1754,4.723684210526316
8036942,4,B00062IEQ4,"OK, I will be brave enough to be the first person to review this DVD. I rate this DVD as 4 stars, although performing-wise maybe it deserves more than even 5 stars. From the very first moment, from the very first ""Si puo!"", you get an idea how strong this performance is vocally. Huge voices! And I mean huge! Atlantov's singing is very passionate. Sometimes, maybe even too much of emotions, but he is one of the best heroic tenors of his generation and this performance shows you why. Nothing seems difficult to him. Low register, middle voice, brilliant high notes. In Kalinina you will find great Nedda. She is amazing. Her voice is so beautiful and so rich. She is outstanding. Orchestra is also phenomenal. However, I still give this DVD 4 stars and the reason is because the chorus sings in Russian language while leading characters sing in Italian. It is little bit strange, but that's the way operas were staged in USSR. I am surprised the whole cast did not perform in Russian. And also the camera-work is not so great, the picture is little bit dark, not perfect, but sound is great. So I think it is a good idea to see this production. You get an idea how outstanding Bolshoi Opera Theater was and remains nowadays.",1102032000,11,1227,4.5565610859728505
