8595804,5,B00DPDKT8W,"This is yet another great season of hilarity for the Psych cast, writers, producers, and the amazingly versatile creator, Steve Franks.

This series just seems to get funnier every season, every episode, and with every new guest star. James Roday is a brilliant actor and his ability to banter with each other cast member is unbelievable. With Dul Hill and Corbin Bernsen to play off of it's no wonder that the producers are ecstatic with Roday's off-the-cuff, impromptu riffs.

This DVD set is well worth the price - highly recommended!",1438732800,,537,4.955555555555556
