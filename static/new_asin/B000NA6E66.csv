8176170,5,B000NA6E66,"After I finished watching the 15 years of the DVD version of the TV hit series, ER - I just could not resist watching this.  It was fitting to see how things worked behind the scenes.  I surely would recommend this to anyone who was/is a fan of ER.",1392163200,2,248,4.040816326530612
8176171,5,B000NA6E66,"As an old ER fan, this show was really fun to watch.  There is an incredible amount of behind the scenes work, stuff you'd never even think about, and fantastic attention paid to details to make the show as realistic as it was.  From seeing the different kinds of fake blood for various purposes, to the prosthetic devices custom built for the actors to wear, to the ridiculously real mechanical babies, and the walk through the archives of props (medicine bottles, stethoscopes, etc.) it is truly amazing.  You understand the value of the artists and researchers who create the ER world, so that the actors can step into it, and truly become their characters.  If you loved the ER series, you'll love seeing behind the curtain (so to speak)!",1381536000,2,742,4.728682170542636
