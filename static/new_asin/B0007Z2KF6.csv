2253350,1,B0007Z2KF6,"What many of us feared has come true: Universal has apparently replaced at least some of the music on season 3 as it did on season 2.  Universal's replacement of the music is an outrage, especially in this age of director's cuts and original aspect ratios.

While Universal's replacement of the music and bare-bones releases reveal that Universal just does not understand this series and its fans, they also reveal that we are unlikely to get anything better.  So you will have to decide whether you are willing to buy what Universal has released or do without the series on DVD.

While I originally decided to boycott the DVDs, I begrudgingly relented after learning that the show is cut by 10% or more when shown in reruns (to allow for more commercials).  So in an ironic twist, Universal's bastardized version of this series is likely to be closer to the original intent than the versions shown in reruns.

I still hate Universal for what it has done to this series, and hope that the person who made that decision suffers for it someday, but for now, I will make due with what is available.",1112227200,18,1095,4.618556701030927
2253351,5,B0007Z2KF6,"The reason VHS copies of ""Northern Exposure"" had all the music left in tack  and some recent DVDs have not is that copyright laws have CHANGED since VHS was the primary format for home video and licensing costs have risen.  Universal has to licensee each and every song used in each and every episode individually and it is very much within the realm of possibility that some of the copyright holders and some of the songs used either will not allow them to be used or want so much money that it makes it prohibitively expensive to do so.  If you want to blame anyone, blame the copyright holders.

This is why we may never see a DVD set for the great sitcom ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" and why fan's of ""The Wonder Years"" are still waiting for DVD sets.  The simple fact of the matter is that you can either have ""Northern Exposure"" DVD sets with some music variations, or no ""Northern Exposure"" DVD sets.  I, for one, chose the former.  Some other shows, such as ""Moonlighting"" may have been fortunate to have found copyright holder more cooperative about licensing than others.  Again, if you want to blame anyone, blame the copyright holders.

Look, here is a novel idea.  Why don't we wait until we find out what the third season on DVD is like before we start slamming this page with one star reviews complaining about how season two was released?

Having said all of that, season #3 and season #4 were the best seasons that ""Northern Exposure,"" one of the handful of greatest TV shows ever, had and I for one can't wait to have them on DVD.",1112140800,16,1540,4.464285714285714
2253352,3,B0007Z2KF6,Liar Liar Pants on Fire.  How can they claim the reason for the added expense of Northern Exposure on DVD is because of the music rights....and yet they were able to release nearly a half a dozen titles a few years ago on VHS with no premium cost?  Someone is taking advantage of us.  Wonder who?,1111968000,4,296,4.25
2253353,2,B0007Z2KF6,"If the reality is that music rights are expensive, and that the DVD companies are trying to ""help"" us by keeping costs down on DVD's, WHY are there multiple shows from the 80's and 90's that still get the original music included, and keep a competitive price nevertheless?

MOONLIGHTING is coming out on DVD, and they managed to keep all the original songs.  Better yet, it still is affordable at $39.95.  If other companies are doing it, why can't the people releasing NE?

I was extremely disappointed with the first season, and I burned and ripped my copy of the second season from the video rental store so that I would have the benefit of the 2nd season Northern Exposure without the *blemish* of actually having to PAY for something inaccurately dubbed as ""The COMPLETE Second Season"".

Don't bother buying the third season.  Look for it on bit torrent (under my handle), and it'll be available for everyone to enjoy for no cost at all.  That's *why* the internet is great, after all.  If the companies want to cheat us out of the original music of the COMPLETE third season, we'll cheat ""them"" out of some of their money for the COMPLETE season as well.  Fair is fair.  If they want to lowball things by cutting corners, turnabout is only fair play.  =)",1111622400,12,1260,4.605381165919282
2253354,5,B0007Z2KF6,"The reality is simple.  Changes in copyright law means that licensing costs of music are expensive and these costs are multiplied on shows like NoEx which used music as a key point of many of its episodes.  It is quite possible that Universal was unable to license all of the songs used in season two which is why some of it has been replaced.  Copyright law is a very complicated issue which might also explain why some of the songs missing in season two are available in other countries or even in an alternate language track.  Furthermore it could well be that the rather cheesy presentation on previous NoEx DVD sets (flip discs, etc.) was done as a way to keep the already expensive sets (due to licensing) down in price so they would not be priced out of the market.  The expensive per episode of the first two sets are probably designed to subsidize subsequent season which had a full slate of episodes.  Note the title of this set: ""The *COMPLETE* Third Season.""

Look, I'd LOVE to be able to have each and every NoEx episode in its original pristine form complete with each and every song.  But I realize that such may well be financially difficult if not all but impossible (it is possible that the copyright owners of some of the music refused to grant licensing rights).  As it is I am simply thrilled we are getting this first rate show on DVD and season three is, quite possibly, the best season of all with such episodes as ""The Body in Question,"" and ""Seoul Mates,"" among others ranking among the best commercial TV has ever had to offer.  Season four, which given the release schedule so far could be out in the fall of 2005, rivals season three.",1111622400,13,1663,4.495016611295681
2253355,4,B0007Z2KF6,"According to other internet resources selling the 3rd season states it will go for $59.98 and come with 3 DVD, so it looks like it will be the entire season. THAT MAKES ME VERY, VERY, VERY HAPPY.....TO break up the season would be like taking Chris in the morning off the Radio (it just doesn't work) if you know what I mean. So I say bring on the entire season and lets not mess around.

2253357,4,B0007Z2KF6,"Dear Sirs, customers of Amazon, and internet surfers alike:

As far as I am concerned, Northern Exposure is my favourite TV series ever. I watched most of the episodes in my home country, Spain, and I am now buying the different seasons that get published overseas.

I bought the first season, since the parka was cool, and the sound and image quality were really better than the edition of the first season we got in Spain.

-you can check this out comparing editions of the UK (which is the same edition as in Spain) and USA or Canada-

So I was really happy to buy the second season, with another great parka, and with a very high image quality. The sound was good too, but there is a big flaw to be considered.

Some of the music that was originally used in certain scenes was removed, and subsituted with some meaningless elevator music. This is a true fact. And it is a relevant issue to be taken into account, given that Universal stated that the higher price of the previous season was due to paying the music rights and so forth. We paid more for a complete edition of this wonderful TV series.

However, season two came out with the same price, but without some songs. I noticed these changes while watching the show, and it is a pity for we the fans of this series. We deserved more transparency from Universal, more information.

What is more, the original music IS actually in the DVD of the second season! In the Spanish language track, you CAN listen to those wonderfully chosen songs!

So please, Universal, we need an explanation for this. You made a big mistake, either changing only one track (I suppose that the rights for the songs do not depend on which language you include them in) or changing the music, simply.

Now the third season is about to come out. Great news, but: will we have a bittersweet aftertaste? The answer can only be posted by Universal.

Is the original music included this time?

We already know there is no parka this time (pity!). Let's cross our fingers and hope that the music is included in its full version. We already have George Lucas changing original movies, we do not need more people doing this kind of things.

This great TV series deserves it.

And yes, I will buy it anyhow.",1110931200,17,2234,4.5

The set of Season 3 that I have contains 3 separate discs, each in their own case, and BOTH sides of each DVD contain the episodes.  The problem I'm noticing is that it seems I should play ONLY SIDE A of EACH of the three discs first, then play side B of each. It would be cumbersome to do this (partly because the labeling inside the interior perimeter edge of the disc is so small and difficult to discern) and the episode description sequence is according to Disc 1, then Disc 2, then Disc 3... not Disc 1 side A, Disc 2 side A, Disc 3 side A, then Disc 1 side B, Disc 2 side B, Disc 3 side B.  As an example, we've noticed that we're seeing episodes where Maggie's house was burned down by her mother and then we see episodes where she's still in her old house. Chris cut his hair for the mayoral election but then in the next episode, his hair is long again until we get to side B of the next disc where it's still short.  Some episodes are ""timeless"" and don't need to be in any order, but some do need to be viewed before the others.",1452470400,,1136,4.035555555555556

2253641,4,B0007Z2KF6,"The pros when it comes to season 3 (and beyond) are that the double sided DVDs are gone, and you get full seasons of the show.  Season 3 has 23 episodes vs the 8 and 7 for the first two seasons.  The con is, of course, some (but not all) of the original music from the series is gone and replaced with canned instrumental music.  Some of the original songs are still there.  Most of the replacement music are in Chris' scenes in the radio station.  I do not have the old episodes on tape and do not remember the original songs off the top of my head (I was a teenager when the show aired, and did not pay a ton of attention to the music) so I am not sure what the original songs were, but you can tell when a replacement was dropped in.

Obviously a main sticking point when it comes to releasing old shows on DVD is getting the rights to the music.  NE is certainly not the only show it has happened to, but it was a show where music was a large part of the show and not always just on in the background.  The reality is that Universal could not just release the DVDs with original music without getting permission from all the rights holders to all the songs.  If they did they would be sued.  The big controversy when the first couple seasons got released on DVD was the high cost (especially since there were so few episodes) because they paid for the rights to all the songs and passed it on to the consumer.  Now yes, you can be mad that they were too cheap to continue to pay whatever it takes to get all the songs, but these days the only way to see the show is in this format.  It is not on in syndication any longer, so unless you taped it on VHS years ago, there would be no way to see it.  So you have to make the choice about whether or not having all the music will ruin your enjoyment of the show to an extent that you could never watch it any other way.

The third season begins to abandon Joel's ""fish out of water"" feeling, and starts to focus on more of the ancillary characters and the town itself.  It also expands on the sexual tension and ""will they/wont they"" aspect to the Joel and Maggie relationship.  Toward the end of the season you started to see less of Rob Morrow because he was starting to have contract issues with the producers.  As a result many of the episodes began what would continue into the remaining seasons of focusing on other story lines.  The show had very high quality acting and writing however, so even though they began reducing his role the show remained entertaining.

As far as extras go, there are deleted and/or extended scenes for every episode on each disc.  The last disc has a few different gag reels and some unaired storylines.  There are no commentaries or interviews with cast members at all, but for what is there, the material is good.  The A/V quality is about what you would expect for a DVD presentation of a show that is now over 20 years old.  Not great, but better than what you would get on VHS. If you can accept not having all the music, it is definitely worth picking up because the show is wonderful, and this is probably the best overall season.  If the music thing bothers you too much, then skip it.",1402185600,13,3179,4.216528925619834

Other than that the show is now entering into it's classic Northern Exposure story lines. The mid point, before the terrible decline starting for me in season 5 and tragically in season 6. But, at least in season 3 we are still hopeful Maggie and Joel will lay down their arms and just admit damn it that they love each other, or at least are seriously attracted to each other. That Ed might, just might, shed his self doubting beaten down persona and really make a movie, or write that script, is season 3 where he receives the Shaman calling? In season 3, things are still good, and as they should be. No Dr. Capra, and worse Mrs. Capra to chew up and spit out the scenery and with it most of the lines.

The show is set in a small town of Alaska, Cicily, and documents the lives of a New York doctor and all of the lovable characters who live there. This television series was broadcast during the 90's but it, in my opinion, was ahead of its time. I can recall watching it on TV with my grandparents when I was little, and loving it then. It is suitable for individuals of all ages, and I don't think it is possible to see just one season. Oh, have I mentioned that I love it?",1282176000,,585,4.095652173913043

But,after I watched the scene on the DVD I had this feeling that something wasn't right. I didn't dwell on it too much. Of course,this is before I found out that Universal chose not to include some of the original music in the DVD compilation.
The music on this show mattered. It's the reason why I bought both soundtrack CDs when they were released.
I have the money and I will pay if you give me what I want. And what I want is the series delivered on DVD as originally aired.
Why doesn't Universal release a compilation for people like me?
Are the music license issues the only reason for the edit?
It angers me when people take what you love and change it so as to increase its profitability.
What do the creators of Northern Exposure think about these changes?
This is so stupid. Now I can't watch any of the episodes because I'll always have this feeling that something's missing.

I first noticed it in the scene where Maurice arrives in the bar drunk during his mid-life crisis.  ""Family Tradition"" by Hank Williams, Jr. was missing from the scene.  As I investigated more, I noticed very pivotal musical numbers were missing from other scenes.  And, when the characters are in the Brick, THOSE signature songs are missing, and replaced by really crappy milquetoast elevator music.  It ruins the episodes for me.  This might not all be Universal's fault.  ASCAP and BMI have gotten particularly greedy when it comes to re-usage rights.  It sucks for the consumer.  In the case of Northern Exposure, in many, many scenes, it just falls apart.",1276905600,15,765,4.868217054263566

2253750,4,B0007Z2KF6,"Overall, I am pleased with the Northern Exposure Season 3 DVD set. I had no idea, however, that they changed the music that was used in the original tv airings. Case in point is the Wake Up Call episode on Season 3. At the very end of the episode, I was expecting to hear The Cheiftains' Coolin Medley, to which I had been accustomed. When I heard music that was different being played, I was shocked, and went online to verify if anyone else wrote about this. I then saw all the reviews here that, by and large, seemed to mirror how how I felt. The end sequence, as originally aired on television, always moved me to tears as Coolin Medley was played over the montage of the characters celebrating Spring and rebirth, the emotional climax of the song coinciding with the shot of Maurice standing on the roof, playing his grandfather's bagpipes. I really wish they would have kept the original music on the DVD set.",1268438400,3,915,4.485029940119761

I don't know how the third season compares to any of the others, it's the only one I've got. But what I've seen of it so far, it's exactly as I remembered the series, interesting characters, somewhat off the wall story lines, quirky humor, and some characters that remind you of somebody you know, you just can't quite place who...

On the other hand the writers and crew had to expand on their characters and themes, producing over twice the amount of stories than the first and second seasons combined.  Rick is reborn as a dog?  Adam gets an Eve?  Doctor Joel is no longer the center of the show, as many of the other characters become the reason for the story, and a lot of the episodes are not funny.  They are touching, full of drama and sometimes sadness.  But this show was meant to be FUNNY.

I too am SEVERELY DISSAPOINTED with the music change in many of the episodes.  Why are they messing with such a good thing? Is this some kind of copywrite infringement deal or something?

When I bought the DVD I was looking forward to hearing 2 songs in particular, that I wanted to hear again because it was so touching when I first saw it.  One was in Ep. 4.11 Survival of the Species when the female vocals were playing as the women burried the women's things in Maggie's yard.  It was painfully ungratifying to hear it replaced with some grating operatic substitute that had no place at all in the scene.  The other was in Ep. 6.15 at the end of ""the Quest"" when Joel is on the boat back to New York.  That sub song was equally irritable.  And many other little songs here and there that was so jarring to hear, they seemed really out of place.  Are they even coming out with the original music or is this it?

The writing, character development, and locations all add up to one entertaining, quirky, serious, and funny television show that might have you looking at things in a way you might not have thought possible.  Its subtle and not in your face approach to philsophical ideas and how they relate to the many faces of humankind is something that many current writers, producers, and directors should pay attention to.  I have to give the DVDs bad marks in regards to the rerelease production quality.  In many of the segments, background music from the original airing has been replaced by muzak or songs that kind of sound like the original song musically but not lyrically.  Special features such as deleted scenes have slowly disappeared from each successive season and have been shuffled around from the DVD in the set that has the episode upon it to the B-side of the last DVD in the set.  This makes it difficult to watch related outtakes together with the associated episode without moving discs about.

2253819,5,B0007Z2KF6,"I discovered this series (thanks to Amazon reviewers) only in 2006, while looking for some DVDs to carry with me when going home to be with my mother just after she was diagnosed with a severe illness. I usually read rather than watch DVDs but I felt that, on this occasion, I would lack the necessary concentration to deal with books.

I bought the 3rd season instead of an earlier one purely for its better value for the money (over 20 episodes instead of 8 or 9), but easily got into knowing the characters within the first couple of episodes.

I watched this series before going to sleep or during several sleepless nights, and found it extremely quirky, funny, and able to distract me, while at the same time dealing with serious issues, such as death, in a manner that I found hopeful as well as touching. I laughed and cried (and I rarely do the latter) and appreciated the intelligent dialogue and depth of content, both rare commodities in many shows nowadays (I realize that  I sound really old with this statement, but I am only very moderately so).

Not having seen the original series I cannot really comment on the soundtrack, but I did notice some really interesting music in some scenes, and failed to notice it at all in many other moments. If the pieces I noticed are the survivors from the original series, then I can see why so many are upset about it being missing in the DVDs, but they are still well worth watching. My DVDs got momentarily stuck occasionally, so maybe they are too packed with data, but overall the quality was OK.

It is a perversion of original intent. It is tearing the sails of the schooner America. It is slashing Mario Andretti's tires. It is spoiliation of achievement.

Universal has taken a 5 star show and given it a 1 star DVD treatment. The show is still there. And it's not a totally empty shell. But nobody buying these DVDs who has seen the show as intended should be deceived: You WILL notice the difference. There is no cherry on top. There is no final perfection.

2253839,1,B0007Z2KF6,"I am surprised and angered by Universal's decision to release seasons 2 and 3 of ""Northern Exposure"" on dvd with original music deleted. When this series was originally airing on network television, more than one reviewer astutely observed the vital and critical role that the carefully selected music played in this finely crafted series. In fact, I believe I remember reading that this was the first TV series for which viewer interest in the music was so high that a web-page was specially created listing titles and info on the songs featured in each episode. It was very evident that the featured and background music in each show was meticulously chosen and to blend with and accentuate the narrative and themes. Frequently the emotional impact of a particular scene was solidified -- and in some cases actually established -- by the accompanying music. The musical selections, like the show itself, were frequently offbeat and out of the mainstream, but they were well thought-out, well integrated and represented some of the most talented and critically acclaimed artists of the show's period and before. The generic elevator-style music that Universal has chosen to substitute for those original songs is an insult to the show, its fans and their customers. I realize that licensing of music is no simple matter, but I also know that it is possible and that it has been done for other series. I would hope that, particularly with the all of the negative attention that has resulted from this decision, that Universal will make this situation right for future dvd releases, and will re-release seasons 2 and 3 in their intact (as originally aired) form -- with all of the original music. I believe that the typical fan of this show would tend to be the type of individual for which this kind of thing matters. And I believe most would be willing to pay a little more, or wait a little longer, as long as it meant seeing this series in its unaltered form. Smart marketing might actually highlight and take advantage of the musical excellence of this series via bonus features-- e.g., providing lists and information pertaining to the songs and artists featured in each episode. My low rating pertains almost entirely to the very poor judgment in this decision to modify the show before releasing on DVD. (To a lesser extent, it also pertains to other problems inherent in these discs, which other reviewers have also pointed out, but which I believe are minor compared to the issue of removing the original music.) Were it not for those factors, and if I were judging only the quality of the original series, I would give this release the highest possible rating. I believe it remains, to this day, one of the finest shows that has ever been produced for network television, and this is the season where it really began to hit its stride.",1139788800,40,2845,4.831967213114754

2253844,5,B0007Z2KF6,"Season Three, which began in the fall of 1991, was the first full season of NORTHERN EXPOSURE after two very short seasons that appeared in the summer of 1990 and the spring of 1991.  The first two seasons, though brief, were tantalizing for their uniqueness and quality.  Season One lacked many of the fantasy and surreal elements that was such an important part of the subsequent seasons, but from Season Two until the final season when the show began to suffer following the loss of Rob Morrow, the show was amazingly consistent.  Until THE X-FILES debuted in the fall of 1993, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was far and away the quirkiest, most delightful television show on network television.  Even the staid Emmys, which usually reserves its award for less innovative, interesting series, acknowledged the brilliance of the show by recognizing Season Three by awarding it the Emmy for Best Drama.

Though the first two seasons did not lack for great individual episodes, Season Three hit the ground running and turned out one classic episode after another.  Beginning with ""The Bumpy Road to Love,"" in which Maggie learns of her dead lover Rick's many infidelities and Joel and kidnapped by Adam's lover Eve until the season finale ""Cicely,"" which tells of the town's founding by two progressive lesbians, viewers were given one imaginative treat after another.  Choosing favorites in such a rich season is almost silly, but I do have favorites.  I loved ""Oy Wilderness,"" in which Maggie and Joel have engine problems while flying back to Cicely and are forced to spend a couple of days in the wilderness.  Even better was ""Animals R Us,"" where Maggie becomes convinced that a stray dog is actually Rick reincarnated.  One of Joel's best episodes comes in ""A-Hunting We Will Go,"" where the nonhunting New Yorker gains a sudden passion for hunting that can only be described as bloodlust, only to suffer a change of heart when he can't stand to kill the grouse he has shot, instead binding its wounds and nursing it back to health.  A circus comes to Cicely in ""Get Real,"" with the performers portrayed by members of Cirque du Soleil and Marilyn engages in a courtship in which words play only a small role.  ""Burning Down the House"" is memorable for a visit from Maggie's mother, who inadvertently burns down her house, and for Chris's attempt to find just the right cow to throw through the air on his trebuchet, deciding to toss a piano instead once Ed informs him that Monty Python had performed the same stunt in a movie.  ""Democracy in America"" is precious if for no other reason than to see the previously hirsute Chris show up at the polling site resplendent with a fresh shave, haircut, and conservative black suit and tie.  The pride with which he, a convicted felon unable to vote, gazes upon all those able to exercise their right to vote is for me one of the highpoints of the season.  In a season filled with amazing episodes, my favorite might have been ""It Happened in Juneau.""  Forced to share a room because of a lack of hotel rooms, Joel and Maggie decide to have sex, only to have a sleep-deprived Maggie pass out before they do the deed.  Maggie nonetheless thinks they have, with ramifications for future episodes.  By the way, fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL should look out for James Marsters (aka Spike) in this one as the Bellhop Joel talks to in the hotel after his presentation bombs at the medical conference.  Also check out the extras for a funny ad lib where Joel embraces the Bellhop.

Season Three doesn't alter the alchemy that had been created in Season Two, though it did polish it.  In particular Chris achieved the importance he would possess throughout the show's run as both the town's conscience and soul.  Using his radio show ""Chris in the Morning"" (even if broadcast at night), he hovers over the town like a benevolent spirit, offering his blessing on all the inhabitants.  Though not traditionally religious in any way, NORTHERN EXPOSURE was consistently one of the most spiritual shows on TV, and without Chris that would have been impossible.  He seems to embody all the wonder about the glory of being alive that the show itself strives to communicate.  Elsewhere in Cicely, Joel continues to adjust only gradually to living in Cicely, while he and Maggie continue doing their love/hate mating dance.  Surely one reason the show's creators (and those of every other show with a potential romance) were hesitant to allow Joel and Maggie get together was because of what happened on MOONLIGHTING when David and Maddie were allowed to consummate things:  the show's ratings plunged.  As a result of the David and Maddie fiasco (though I think personally that the ratings dive of MOONLIGHTING was as much the result in a decline in the quality of the writing as having the romance come to fruition), every show since then has created as many impediments to having people attracted to one another get together as possible.  So, Joel and Maggie were emulated by Mulder and Scully, Lois and Clark, John Crichton and Aeryn Sun, Buffy and Angel (when Buffy did get a boyfriend in Riley, he significantly was one none of us cared about), and Jack and Kate.  The central romance in almost every series is like those figures in Keats's ""Ode to a Grecian Urn,"" where the lovers are always chasing but never embracing each other throughout eternity.

NORTHERN EXPOSURE is fascinating from a narrative standpoint.  Beginning with HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties, most ""quality"" shows tended to have multiple story arcs running at once, most of which did not get resolved each episode.  NORTHERN EXPOSURE actually adopted the stand alone format that dominated most television from its creation until the eighties.  Each episode would introduce two or three plot elements, all of which would be resolved by the end of that episode.  The show was almost unique in the nineties or the current decade for resolving conflict each week.  It differed from pre-HILL STREET BLUES shows, however, by constantly picking back up themes from previous shows.  The result was that you got a sense that the show had ongoing arcs, whereas in fact it merely picked back up previously resolved stories.  The only episode from Season Three where one episode immediately picks up on the previous episode was ""Our Wedding,"" in which Maggie becomes furious when she learns that she and Joel had not in fact had sex in the previous episode.

Finally, this is the first set in the NORTHERN EXPOSURE series where one doesn't have to complain about the cost.  The price is comparable to other single-season sets of TV shows.  It is still almost impossible to understand the rationale in releasing Seasons One and Two in separate sets and each priced as if it were a full season.  They remain two of the most overpriced sets for any television show.  Nonetheless, if there is such a thing as ""Must See"" TV, this is as close as any series can come to ""Must Own"" TV.

Note:  For those complaining about the substitution of music, this is something we just have to deal with.  If you want a culprint, don't blame Universal but the RIAA.  The demands for royalties on the original music is simply too high to make inclusion of it possible.  This is why ALLY MCBEAL has not been released on DVD and is likely never to be released.  The music on that show was too integral to allow of substitution, but the royalties are simply prohibitive to allow of a box set that anyone could afford.  As long as publishers insist on exorbitant fees we will see music substitution.  It is why they can't include the original music videos in episodes of BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD.  It is why many current TV shows employ from the start music from lesser performers.  Just don't blame Universal.  They really don't have any choice in the matter.  It's either substitute or charge $99 for each season.",1139184000,10,7891,4.7794985250737465

It's the production of the dvd set that I am disgusted with.  The first two seasons were only half seasons which is NOT reflected in the price.  Also, and this is the worst and most annoying aspect, the dvd's are recorded on both sides.  This means, of course, that there is almost no place where you can touch the disk without worrying about doing damage.  They put six to eight episodes on a single disc.  The writing to identify the disc is around the center hole and is nearly microscopic.  I own two other dvd sets that are well made and are of popular recent shows so I know it is possible to make something well and keep the price reasonable.

I do own the first and second seasons and am enjoying them very much. Although I enjoyed the music when the show was on the air, I have not noticed the ""missing"" music as other reviewers have mentioned, at least with regard to Seasons One and Two, so they either kept the original music in the ""big"" scenes from the first two seasons, or I must not have paid that much attention to the music when the show was on the air (except for Iris Dement's ""Our Town"" which I distinctly remember).",1135900800,7,921,4.2988505747126435

Chris in the Morning continues to spin the same music, despite reports to the contrary.  You lose nothing in these DVD's.  I see now that Universal Studios has bundled the first three seasons, which is what it should have done with the first two seasons.  Surprised they didn't wait to package all six seasons, but I guess the remaining seasons will come out in due time.

2253849,3,B0007Z2KF6,"So far, i think season 2 was the best. This season replaces the fire between Joel and Maggie with a flickering match. That's really the whole focal point for their little barbs.. here its hardly existent in most episodes and then made issue in some. Kinda throws me off. Adam and Sgt. Semanski are the best part of this season and they have little screen time in the season. Both are great characters and wish they had been a bigger part. And lastly, the writing seems to be more cute and preachy. ""Cicely"" for example. Even Chris' relativist, Eastern philosophy ramblings take on an annoying tone.  The 2nd season had more witty banter and more random events making this show what its known for. Here its replaced with too much sentiment and less hilarity. I can appreciate giving the show some heart but its slightly too obvious on the sleeve here. Like when Joel discovers that Jack, the previous resident committed suicide, they never really fully tie it all together in a Norther Exposure kind of way. That episode had some really great opportunities to explore but doesn't. Its sentimental but not really well connected themes. Then there's ""Burning Down the House"" which is classic Northern Exposure. Best episode of the season. This season just seems a bit lost for identity.. or maybe trying to assume too many. And am i the only one who really wants to kill Shelly? I actually can't stand that character. Nonetheless, i still look forward to getting season 4... I'm waiting!",1129939200,4,1484,4.77431906614786
2253850,2,B0007Z2KF6,"Responding to the reviewer who said he/she did not watch ""Northern Exposure"" to listen to the music -- For most TV shows, that would be 100% correct.  But I have never experienced a TV show, ever, where the music was so integral to setting the mood and tone of the series as ""Northern Exposure.""  The feeling that you get in certain scenes is completely set in harmony by the original music that accompanied it.  (Ed dancing with the cranes, the ""running of the bulls,"" burying Bill...) The music is what completed the scene.  No other TV series has ever done that, to my knowledge.

I respect the opinion of those who don't care about the music -- that's all the better for them because they can enjoy these DVDs perfectly well!  I wish I was like you!  But for those of us who yearn for the original music... it's just not the same.  I wish Universal recognized that -- I know they could do something about this issue if they wanted.

That having been said, I am reviewing this DVD without having purchased it (I rated it 2 because I have to put something) -- I bought the First Season and was extremely disappointed with the cheap two-sided discs, the lack of any extras, the difficult disc navigation, and the ""parka"" packaging which was a total waste of money as far as I was concerned (spend that money on music royalties!)  I have read the reviews for Season Two and Season Three and nothing has impressed me to urge me to buy them.  I admit it -- I'm cheap.  I'm holding out (praying!) for Universal to issue something worth purchasing -- hopefully a set of all the seasons, with all music intact.

I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released. The third season had a whopping 23 episodes on it, as well as the extra footage of out-takes. You can't go wrong with Northern Exposure.",1127088000,9,682,4.120300751879699

All in all, the ""re-scoring"", or whatever you want to call it, of a few parts of a few episodes was done well.

As for some of the comments about audio synch, I have not noticed this issue and have watched (almost) all of the set now. This may be an isolated anomoly, and may have something to due with the DVD players in question.

But the third season is even better.  There are so many memorable episodes in this collection.  By and large, the best and most moving episode is the season finale, ""Cicely.""  It won three Emmy awards and the Director's Guild Award, and when you watch it, you will clearly understand why.  The writing is of cinematic quality, and the pure emotion in the episode will leave you both moved and inspired.

2253860,3,B0007Z2KF6,"I hadn't realized how much the background music in a TV show really matters until today, as I was watching the episode ""Wake-Up Call"" on the Season 3 DVD.  At the end of the episode, there is a lovely piecing together of shots of each character as a song plays over it (with no dialogue heard.)  My heart almost broke today watching this scene on the DVD, because I remember the original song that had played at this moment.  It was an Irish tune called ""Coolin Medley"" played by the Chieftains.  The song that replaces it on the DVD?  An oriental/Irish-sounding melody that is quite bland in comparison; there were no real climaxes and it really didn't fit the scene.  But the ""Coolin Medley"" was perfect!  I remember watching that scene on TV and smiling because the music was so uplifting and perfect for what was happening with each of the characters.  If you can possibly get a hold of the original TV-aired episode (perhaps someone recorded it?), watch it and compare that ending scene with the DVD version.  It makes you want to cry at what they have done to our beloved TV show.  The music was such an integral part of Northern Exposure.  They really need to release the show as it was...not as some bastardized version of itself.  The fans will gladly pay for it, I can testify.",1125619200,16,1287,4.523809523809524
2253861,4,B0007Z2KF6,"In the past seasons releases, we the consumers could feel kind of ripped off. Afterall, Season 1 only had 8 episodes, season 2 was down to 7 episodes. We may have been hardpressed to be willing to shell out the $40-50 for the price tags on each of those seasons when they should honestly have been released in unison in one set of Season 1 & 2 package giving us 15 episodes for the one price. Finally we have our first full season of NEx with 20some episodes. This is the proper satisfaction of acceptable material/episodes for the pricing.

Rather than go on about how great NEx was, let's look at the actual product here. Before, you got the cute but quaint little parka with your season package. Now we have the standard cardboard box holder. At least it will stand up on your shelf properly and your kid's Barbie doesn't get another sleeping bag (ie the parka package). The quality of the show is transferred well and the images are just as good as the original airings. The sound is well done through the majority of the episodes (one of them had music vs speech balance screwed up).

No the downer of the set. Upon reading some reviews with their rantings about being upset that original series music wasn't included, I would laugh at their pettiness. The thing is, in some small part they were right. There is a definite lack when watching the episodes and you can hear the bland, generic, soft sounds, and instrumental mish mash with which Universal replaced the original scores. You can however, overlook (overlisten?) the majority of the music filler but there are certain points in certain shows where you think, ""What the heck?!""; prominently is the quirky music that Chris in the Morning played during his segments. No longer do we get the oddball yet infectious tunes Chris dealt us but rather some blah piece of orchestral pablum.

Why can't these companies just produce a few (or, in some cases, only a couple)extra dvds and just charge a little more? Does noone care at all about quality anymore? It seems everyone is only out to make a buck, without a care in the world about what they will leave behind eventually. I for one suggest that anyone who cares about this starts a petition, and we get enough people to volunteer to pay a little more for each season (of this show or any others) in order to get something that, if properly taken care of, will LAST FOREVER. If workers can unionize then why not buyers? Let's all get together on this, people. Let's demand top quality. It's better than having to eventually buy the same damn thing more than once.

This is why hacks like Britney Spears are all over the radio and charts and why tripe like ""American Idol,"" ""Dancing with the Stars"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" are big ratings grabbers.

One can lament the loss of some of the music in the ""Northern Exposure"" DVDs but if Universal is unable to obtain the rights for a song (sometimes the answer from copyright holders is simply NO) there are simply only two solutions: replace the song for which the rights could not be obtained, or not release the particular episode (or the entire series) at all.  That music that is here (and this is probably 99% of the songs that were featured prominently) still costs money to license. This it adds up for each individual song and on the back of the third season DVD set is a disclaimer: MUSIC MAY DIFFER FROM TELEVISED VERSION.  I'm sure Universal could have lowered the price for these sets much further by simply replacing ALL the music even if they were able to obtain the rights, but we all know what would have happened then.

The vast majority of people who watched and loved ""Northern Exposure"" during its original five year run on CBS will simply not notice the few changes that have been made in order to get this exceptionally good series onto DVD, and how does one expect ""younger audiences"" to appreciate this show if they simply aren't allowed to see it at all  due it being withheld from the market because some copyright holders simply said ""NO"" when it came to allowing songs they owned from being included?

I don't consider that the omission of some music being a ""trivial"" matter, but I do recognize it as part of the sad reality of the day.  Heaven knows there are too many people today who see things in black and white terms so I, for one, am glad that Universal chose not to play that game and that I can still see these groundbreaking television series as a result of their siding with the gray.",1122422400,14,2034,4.646239554317549
2253875,1,B0007Z2KF6,"Nor am I an economic ""fuzzy."" I'm an arch-capitalist who is fully aware that businesses exist for the purpose of turning a profit. HOWEVER, there's a matter of integrity involved, both economic and artistic.
A number of NE fans, presumably younger ones, seem to have overlooked a basic point. Brand & Falsey, the creators of NE, are Baby Boomers; in fact, I think they're probably my age. We grew up glued to Top 40 radio which, through the mid-50's and beyond, played just about any type of music that DJ's thought listeners would enjoy (and would sell)--pop, rock, easy listening, country, R&B, novelties, saga songs, movie themes--you name it, it probably got played. That music helped to form our tastes as we got older; it prepared us to be receptive to virtually all music, including the new wave that hit in the mid-70's and which sometimes appears in NE, e.g., Robert Palmer. In fact, that music helped form us as people; THIS is why the music is such an integral part of NE and why the particular pieces used were chosen: Brand & Falsey are products of their time and culture and they're paying tribute to it. In fact, I don't believe that younger audiences can even fully appreciate the series because they're not familiar with the music. Would Rick's funeral procession be as funny if ""Nature Boy"" weren't being played as ironic background music? How many younger viewers recognize ""Theme from Moulin Rouge"" when Shelly tries to emulate a 50's housewife? THIS is the ""seasoning"" that contributes to the flavor of an already funny show and raises its level to the sublime.
To put it bluntly: the music is itself a character in the series.
And how successful, may I ask, is the rerelease of a series in which a character's participation is edited? And how ethical is a business concern that gives no warning of any kind on the packaging of that release to the effect that one of the characters is missing? I thought we were supposed to have progressed past the days of ""caveat emptor.""
Universal has a pretty crummy track record, from where I sit, where doing right by their customer base is concerned. And pray answer, previous reviewer, why, if the rights to the music were not available, said music appears in its entirety...on the SPANISH LANGUAGE TRACK?! I suspect I'm not unique in wanting an explanation to that one. And why are purchasers asked to shell out big bucks on the basis of ""securing the rights"" for music that's not included, not to mention even crummier packaging than on the previous releases? (Yeah, I know it's cheaper on Amazon, but that's only because it's not selling well.)
Fans are entitled to opine that the omission of the music is trivial. However, to postulate that the disappointment of those of us with higher standards and who know better is unreasonable is just outrageous, particularly in view of the fact that we just want the series the way it was released--in its entirety. Universal ought to be ashamed.
My only hope is that they don't get their mitts on St. Elsewhere.
Note to a succedent reviewer: Perhaps it escaped your attention that ""appreciate"" was qualified by the adverb ""fully"" in my review. People are not only entitled to their own opinions, they appreciate things on different levels, e.g., I'm aware that I cannot ""fully"" appreciate Tarkovsky because I don't speak Russian; nevertheless, I'm a fan. Regardless, I want to view his work as he intended it, which is why I'm unhappy with Kino's release of ""Mirror."" I read Amazon reviews because I want to know what I don't know. And if, as you write, younger viewers are to ""appreciate"" NE, wouldn't they have a better shot at doing so ""fully"" if the series were presented as intended and originally released or at least being aware that they're getting an altered release? My complaint was with those who think that people like myself have no basis for disappointment; if you're happy with the status quo, that's fine for you. But on what grounds do you base your claim that ""the vast majority of viewers,"" etc., won't notice the omission (a speculative stretch, to say the least)? Certainly not on the fact that Amazon has the series ""priced to move,"" as it were, not to mention the reviews expressing disappointment, not to also mention that the people for whom the series was targeted have been programmed by years of Top 40 Radio listening to associate songs with events--""scenes"" in this case. With all due respect, you're way off base.
Refer back to my ""Spanish language track"" observation (for which no one has yet offered an explanation), and as for the disclaimer that FINALLY appears on the package, well, better late than never, I guess--it doesn't change the fact that it would seem that their prior omission was misleading and based on thinking like yours, i.e., that the ""vast majority"" of purchasers ""wouldn't notice"" and that ""...business and artistic intergrity are pretty much [...] mutually exclusive.""
I stand by my review; its basis isn't speculative. I've personally had bad experiences with Universal's DVD releases; I've never even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement of my ever-so-correct correspondence with regard to defective merchandise (and no, unless Universal is also producing movies involving women and donkeys or have expanded their manufacturing base to include ""prescription meds,"" no reply was inadvertantly overlooked in my spam folder).
I should've guessed that my mess of a Monster Legacy Box Set and the commercials that couldn't be skipped on the most recent release of Animal House (just like TV but more expensive!) were harbingers of more bad things to come.

Universal produced the show and sells in on DVD for one reason and one reason only -- TO MAKE MONEY.  If they could not make money off of it the show would never have been made in the first place.

Poor packaging, inaccurate dubbing, and weak organization are legitimate complaints but enough about the music substitutions.  THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT NOT ALL MUSIC WAS AVAILABLE UNDER COPYRIGHT LAWS and there is NOTHING Universal can do about that other than replace it or simply decline to issue the show on DVD at all.  The rights to each song has to be individually acquired for a DVD and if the copyright holder simply say s ""NO"" the song cannot be legally used.

I've watched only four episodes so far, but in each of the four, there are times when the voices are not in sync with the lips of the speaker. This has become incredibly distracting. Especially in episode 3, I think this sync issue occurs three different times, each time lasting 3-4 minutes.

Like I said, I can deal with the music (or lack thereof), but it makes me sick every time I'm watching a new scene and all of a sudden it looks like a bad dub job on a Chinese movie.

Perhaps, that why I desperately waited for the DVD's to come out. As I watched the episodes, one realizes what a high caliber show this was and is. Can you name anything that has as wonderful a combination of comedy, drama, spirituality, and strong characters as this on tv right now? The DVD's are crisp and clear catching Northern Exposure's gorgeous scenery with its wintery landscapes and fresh autumns. It's nice to revisit the general store/post office Ruth Anne ran to the Brick-practically the hubbub of the town. I almost felt like throwing on a parka and heading to Alaska from the images the scenes invoke.

Much has been mentioned about the music. Sometimes I did notice that there seems to be more silent spots where I thought music should be playing. It wasn't until I watched #9 Get Real that the music totally clashed (hard hitting pianos and crazy guitar chords straight out of a low budget soap opera) with  the scene of the silent Flying Man performing for Marilyn. Even then this episode with carnival performers is wonderful. My favorite is the Emmy-winning Seoul Mates episode, a ""Christmas"" in Cicely is awesome indeed. Another favorite is ""The Body in Question"" about the french man frozen from 2 centuries ago is absolutely hilarious.

I guess I could get upset over the stupid credits of Topher Grace's movie (cant even remeber the name of it) that I can't fast foward through, or the dismal packaging, or the music but I am so desperate to view these gems I'll go ahead and take it- all 23 episodes that are worth their weight in gold.",1120089600,7,1721,4.654605263157895

I've know for the past 15 years that ""Northern Exposure"" has a very loyal and dedicate following, but it wasn't until reading some of these reviews that I realized how dense and how far out in La-La land some of them really are.

Music licensing fees are a fact of life and they are here to stay.  Deal.  Yes, there are some ""Northern Exposure"" fans who would happily pay one hundred, two hundred dollars and maybe even more, for a full season set with all original music restored but you know what?  There aren't ENOUGH of them to make such a package cost effective and profitable for Universal who, again REALITY CHECK, are releasing these sets for one purpose and one purpose only -- TO MAKE A PROFIT.  Even issuing two separate sets will not aid in this goal.

Even if somehow they could restore all original music and price the sets at a reasonable level to sell enough copies to be worth their while there is also the distinct possibility that some of the artists and copyright holders of some songs have simply said NO.  No, they won't sell the rights to their songs at ANY price.  What else can Universal do?  Would you rather have nothing rather than having at least something?

Get over the box design.  Sheesh.  People complained endlessly about the parkas and the case design for the first two seasons.  It appears that Universal took heed and redesigned the set for the third season.  So what are people doing now?  Complaining about the redesigned package for the third season, that the missing parka and about how this set will look different on the shelf next to the first two seasons.  Whine, whine, whine.  Gripe, gripe, gripe.  Man can some people ever pick.

""Northern Exposure"" unquestionably represents some of the best programing commercial television has ever had to offer.  But there are many televisions show (late 70's/early 80's sitcom ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" springs to mind) that may NEVER see a DVD release simply due to the fact the music licensing will make such a release cost prohibitive.  I am grateful that ""Northern Exposure"" is finding its way to DVD even if some compromises need to be made in the process.  This isn't genocide or world hunger people.  It is television entertainment.  Let's keep a little perspective.",1120003200,22,2285,4.738578680203045
2253886,4,B0007Z2KF6,"As a long time fan I have immense loyalty to the show but I am incredibly upset by Universal's handling of these DVD series releases. The audio has been so altered to remove and replace the original music that in some places the dubbing of voices to actors lips moving, is worse than a spagetti western or 1970's Hong Kong action film. It is seriously bad and almost impossible to watch. People who buy the show love the entire package, the scripts were clever warm and witty as were the characters and their development. The music was unique and integral enough that not one but two ""song's from Northern Exposure"" albums were created and released. If the fat cat's who make these calls can't justify shrinking their profit margin a little to release it with it's original music so be it, but how dare they show such contempt to their customers as to send it out with it's dialogue not in sync. I am very disapointed ad disatissfied.",1119916800,13,934,4.565476190476191
2253887,1,B0007Z2KF6,"Two Issues:

First, not the original music.  See my review of ""In Living Color, Season 3.""  Same applies here; if studios are going to sell edited versions (in this case and in the case of ""ILC, S3,"" loss of original music) of the series we remember, then they need to state so on the product listing.  Otherwise, let's stop buying the DVDs.  Frankly, I'm sick of the entertainment industry with all its complaints of piracy - what did they do to us selling us an ""incomplete"" product?  It's okay for them to do so, while at the same time they sue some person who is legitimately backing up his/her CDs...?  Let's get Amazon.com to weild its clout and force either a) the original series, or b) some disclaimer on the boxes.  In either case, let the market decide - let's see if customers will pay a higher price for the ""real series."" Or will fully-informed customers cause the sales to tank?  Either way, it's better than getting ripped off like we are now.  For ""Northern Exposure,"" like ""Tour of Duty,"" ""In Living Color,"" or ""thirtysomething"" (if it ever shows up on DVD, the music was the series!

Second, the packaging.  Why did the studio switch from the jacketed (literally) packaging to a boxed set?  It messes up the ""look"" of the series (the Star Trek gang, for example, did a great job of maintaining continuity of packaging for each of the series).

We need to let Amazon know we are displeased and have Amazon pass on our displeasure.  What do y'all think?",1119916800,23,1470,4.557251908396947
2253888,5,B0007Z2KF6,"I have all 110 episodes of the show on VHS and was able to spot immediately where the ""fake"" music replaced the original in each episode on the Season Two DVD and I have to agree with Anthony who said he was ""gutted"" while watching them.  It pretty much ruined it for me too.  Granted the show is great on its own, but as others have said before, the music used in the originals is there for a reason and when heard, engenders emotions that generic music will never be able to do.

Well - I've watched 3 episodes so far on the Season Three DVD and if they have replaced any of the original music, it's not as obvious as it was on Season Two.  While watching ""Only You"" last night, I noticed that Billie Holiday was where she was supposed to be so that's a good sign!  If there is any generic music being used (and the sleeve indicates that some music has been replaced) it's been blended into the background a little more seamlessly, so as not to be so jarring to the long time fans.

Season Three may just be the best season of the series (though season four has some real gems too!) so here's hoping that we won't be disappointed.  Can't wait to get home tonight to watch some more!!",1119484800,16,1185,4.216814159292035

2253890,4,B0007Z2KF6,"I'm adding to packaging comments. My series three came in its green slipboard case with no labelling of 'Northern exposure series 3' on the spine of the case. What is the idea of a blank spine so that when you are searching your shelves for something you have to pull the item out completely to see what it is?

Can't we have a label on the spine too please. We seem to have gone from one extreme to another - from cute parka overkill to almost blank case. Was this an expression of frustration from packaging designers who feel they did well with the parkas and weren't appreciated for it? I didn't mind the parkas but it would have been good to stay with the concept for uniformity once they'd started - or at least visually emulate a parka printed on the casing.

It may also seem picky to focus on packaging but it is part of the product (and a fairly high priced one) you are buying that is there to add to the products accessibility, usefulness and visual appeal. So I hope they lift their game next time.

I loved the music of Northern Exposure for its eclectic suitability. I'm not as tuned into what music was originally in each section. However the music was such a key element in the shows presentation and added to its quirky feel - why mess with something so integral? The series was so good that it may seem petty to comment on these things but music can be very important to mood and is a key artistic element that a lot of thought was put into in the original.

Northern Exposure fans though are there for the DVD contents and will no doubt put up with the irritations but I hope the consumers' needs will be kept more in mind in future.",1119312000,10,1653,4.305466237942122

2253894,4,B0007Z2KF6,"True, the parka pack is gone, and I do miss it. However the change to slimcases warrants a more manageable packaging. And I am in favor of the slimcases because of the improvement of episode listings and synopses on the sleeves. That is definitely nice. Now, more pressing matters:

MUSIC: I went through after purchase to satisfy my curiosity (I didn't have anything else to do at the moment) and held my breath. ALL THE PLOT-INTRINSIC SONGS ARE INTACT, except for the original Chieftans ""Coolin Medley"" from ""Wake up Call"". In terms of incidental music from The Brick and KBHR, ""Jolie Louise"" by Daniel Lanois is missing from ""The Body In Question"", and there are a few more that may be changed, but the majority is still there. All of David Schwartz's brilliant music is still intact, the wonderful symphonic stuff and Willie Nelson's ""Hand's on the Wheel"" are staples of ""Three Amigos"" (perhaps my favorite episode)-still there. Billie Holiday's ""Let's Dream in the Moonlight"" from ""Only You"", Bela Fleck and the Flecktones' ""Flight of the Cosmic Hippo"" from ""Jules et Joel"", The Chieftans' do have ""Il Est Ne"" intact in ""Seoul Mates"", Bach's ""Invention #8"" and Fredrica von Staade's beautiful ""Bailero"" from ""Wake up Call"", Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" from ""Burning Down The House"", ""Democracy In America"" 's Copland ""Simple Gifts"" and the stuff from the American Boys Choir, Enya's ""Caribbean Blue"" from ""The Final Frontier"", and the one I held my breath on, the quintessential quirky song, without which the sequence could not work, ""Toy Cows in Africa"" by Chance for ""It Happened In Juneau""!

So, yes there are a couple of songs missing, and I miss them-great songs. But EVERY OTHER ONE I CHECKED is intact, the video and audio quality: excellent. Still deleted scenes and unexposed footage, the latter now presented in three season-encompassing 10-minute blooper reels, as well as the assemblage of footage from Ed's film.

I also agree with a previous reviewer that said these stupid artists should realize that their music appearing on the DVD's can only help their careers (or lack of career).  I bought music by Iris Dement solely based on the song ""Our Town"" heard in the last episode of NX.  Seriously, the greed in the music industry knows no bounds...but I digress.

As someone who works in the publshing business, i don't think most people have an appreciation for just how much money can be involved for these licenses. You have pay the publisher AND the artist/label for a song. And that could run anywhere from $8,000-14,000 for both licenses. Figure 5-7 songs per episode, and that is 50-70K per episode and there's 23!!!! episodes on this thing. That doesn't even begin to include other costs. So i don't think there's a large market for fans willing to pay $400-$500  for NX dvd sets, that UNI wants to do that make them that way.",1118880000,8,635,4.51304347826087
2253902,5,B0007Z2KF6,"Yeah, sure.  I'd be willing to pay twice, maybe even three times the price for a DVD set of ""Northern Exposure"" with all the original music restored too, but let's face it.  There simply aren't enough of us out there who would be willing to do so to make it cost effective to do so.  Give these sets a list price of a hundred bucks or so and very quickly they will get priced out of the market.  It is just another example of some of the little imperfections a purely market drive economy has.

Then there is another issue altogether.  It is well within the realm of possibility that the copyright holders of some of the songs that are missing simply said NO to allowing their music to be included regardless of how high the price went.  When that happens there are only two choices -- replace the music or do not release that episode at all.  Of those two, I'll go with the former without question.

As for the third season of ""Northern Exposure"" it represents some of the best that commercial television ever had to offer.  Smartly written scripts about unique and very well developed, multidimensional characters in imaginative situations.  It was proof that network television does not always have to relay on the lowest common denominator to get a hit.  At a time when all of American is inexplicably obsessed with the utterly talentless Paris Hilton and contrived ""reality"" programing that is an important message.",1118880000,6,1420,4.658634538152611

What a dissapointment to finally own my favorite episode, Wake-Up Call, and find that Coolin Medley by the Cheiftains has been replaced by a piece of sorry elevator music. I could forgive some little background snippet of music on the jukebox in the brick, but this is the tune that brings the whole episode together at the end of the episode and is vital to carry the emotion of the whole episode.

2253904,5,B0007Z2KF6,"I give this release a full 5 Stars. Thank you Universal, I have also purchased Seasons 1 & 2 and will absolutely buy Seasons 4 through 6 when they are released. This release doesn't have the cute little ""Parka Pack"" that 1 & 2 had. In my opinion it was cute but added little and wasn't the reason I purchased the sets. This release has three separate DVD cases that fit into a green paperboard slip case. Each DVD case includes the Episode title, Episode Number and a description of each episode including special guest stars. These are listed right on the outside of the case so you know exactly which episodes are contained on the DVD even before you open it. This was a nice feature and should satisfy the nay-sayers from the previous releases in regards to inserts, etc. I also want to say my piece in regards to the background music that everyone is griping about. I am a huge NX fan and I didn't notice any difference at all in the first two seasons and wouldn't even have been aware of the ""Music Issue"" even after I watched both seasons through on DVD had I not read these reviews afterward. My opinion is this. Nobody tuned in to NX in the early to mid '90s just to listen to the music and people don't still remain fans to this day soley because of the music. We are fans because of the exemplary quality of the writing and acting. I believe instead of ripping on Universal because of this licensing issue, the blame should be placed on the money grubbing musicians (and their attorneys) wanting to leverage every last cent they possibly can out of everything. Knowing that a huge audience tuned in every week and is still watching this show on reruns and buying these DVDs, I would say that any musician lucky enough to have been included on this show should be thankful for the exposure and realize that they have probably sold more CDs as a result. Case in point: I personally sought out and purchased ""Robert Tree Cody's CD, Maze"" after hearing a portion of ""Bird Song"" on one of the NX episodes. So Hint, Hint, to the musicians with music on Seasons 4 through 6, let your music be heard on these DVDs without trying to leverage Universal (and ultimately us as consumers) to the hilt and you will undoubtedly sell more music. In conclusion, I am extremely happy that this show is available on DVD, a format that will last and I will be able to watch 20 years from now. Thank you Universal and I WILL buy the rest of the seasons when available! Also thank you to Amazon for the extremely high level of customer service. I pre-ordered this DVD set and it was in my mailbox yesterday (June 14) the date it was available in stores. So I give a five star rating to Amazon as well!",1118793600,14,2689,4.390781563126253
2253905,5,B0007Z2KF6,"First off, I gave the DVD sets a 5 star rating because of the video portion of the DVD's. The audio is where the problem lies when talking about the Northern Exposure DVD's. Whoever decided it wise wise to change the music in parts of these episodes should be fired from Universal or at least not ever be allowed to make a decision there again. The music to Northern Exposure is an essential part of the show. Some episodes revolve around the music and to replace the music that was originally in the episodes with cheap ""faux"" music is a rediculous attempt to make more money. I love these DVD sets, but it seems odd watching them and knowing you paid all that money for them and they aren't there in the form they were when you first watched them on T.V.. I wonder if they'll replace all of the Native Indian music as well? Like on one of the later episodes when Dr. Fleischman goes to find Elaine in Seatlle. At the end of that episode there's an excellnt native American vocal song that is my favorite song in the series. Also the song ""Our Town"" tha plays at the end of the very last episode ""Tranquility Base"" is a great song and summarizes the whole series well. But that song was done by a real artist and I wonder if that song will be changed too? It would be a travesty if it was. Someone told me you can hear all of the original music if you watch the episodes with the Spanish option on. Haven't tried it myself though. The people that released the Fraks And geeks DVD's bartered and talked with all of the bands that appeared on their show's soundtrack. It took them a while, but they got all of the to sign on and were able to include all of the music that was on the show on the DVD's and still offer the DVD sets fairly cheaply. And why is there no episode listing on the DVD's or the booklet sleeve? If you want to find a certain episode, you have to keep putting the DVD's in and out of your player to see what episodes are on what disc or what episodes are on side A and B! As for the epsides themselves they are great! It is a pleasure to be able to revisit Cicely, Alaska and be in that world whenever I want to. The episodes look good and it's nice to see the entire episodes and not have 4 or 5 minutes cut out like they do for the reruns of the show. After The Simpsons, Northern Exposure is my favorite TV show of all time. I'm glad these DVD's were released so I can watch them even 20 years down the road.

But I would like to correct what I see as a 'misperception'  in a few of the reviews I've read (I'm not sure if 'misperception' is the best word to use here - but it's the word that comes up for me as I write this). . . I worked in the theatre as a sound tech and designer.  Each moment in any show - TV, film or stage - is a very precious moment (there just isn't a lot of time in a show especially a single TV program!).  I put as much thought and creativity into making each moment on stage the best it can be - I hopefully have the training (and perhaps a little talent) to support a creative vision and add to the texture of the whole production.  Have someone else come in after the fact and change anything - lights, sound, music, costumes, etc - and you change the hard work and creativity, the message and original intent of the artists who created the show.

(Now to address the 'misperception':) I have yet to hear what this Third Season of NX on DVD will bring but to say it's ""only"" the background music that's been changed on the Second Season - ""just"" the background stuff - isn't honoring the whole of what made NX great and it belittles the work of the people 'behind' the camera - they put as much effort and energy into the show as those to the 'front' of the camera.

I for one really miss hearing ""Le Mer"" (from Season 2/Ep 2 - The Big Kiss) playing ""in the background"" as Chris tries to woo Maggie!  Was that ""just"" background music?  I don't think so.  I could go on but my point is - trained and skilled people put time and energy into creating something we all loved - their work too made this show great - and I for one am sad to see their efforts and creativity removed for whatever reason.",1117670400,56,1802,4.137535816618911

We love this series: it is intelligent, entertaining, at times even spiritually enlightening. The characters are engaging and complex. I don't know what more anybody could ask for...what are the odds that anything like this could ever make it into prime time? The odds approach infinity. I can't even think of that many movies that have the same level of intelligence.

Personally I am convinced that Universal is doing its best to safeguard the integrity of the original episodes and transfer this to DVD in 99.9% of its entirety, unless legally impossible. I am inclined to trust the person who was professionally involved in licensing (see his review) rather than the many who are not. If you are one of the ones griping about the music, I simply see no evidence that the integrity of Northern Exposure has been damaged in any significant way on Season 1 or 2. You are not only punishing yourself, but punishing others as well. Those who truly love this series are going to vote with their pocketbooks. And the result will be that Universal will keep releasing the series on DVD. I am truly grateful that Season 3 is coming out and hope the entire series makes it to DVD.

The only legitimate gripe that Universal needs to hear is: skip the damn Parka packaging and use the money for labels. Cripes, blank DVDs in volume is not that expensive and I'd be more than happy to cover the difference. This is the one pet peeve that chaps my ass, Universal!

2253915,5,B0007Z2KF6,"I have been on both sides of this debate - I helped secure a synch license for an obscure 45-second song in a Laugh-In DVD episode.  That one song cost the DVD makers $10,000.  And it wasn't even integral.  Can you imagine the license or royalty cost for famous songs on a release of this size.

So, knowing how much it would cost to produce that ""ideal"" set, I'm totally enjoying NE in the meantime.  Music may have been a ""character"" - but it isn't Joel, Maggie or Maurice.  I haven't noticed anything missing yet - and I've noticed the inclusion of many famous well-known songs.

I truly believe this is a best they can do situation and we've got to live with it.  There will not be a Criterion Edition.  A million things to enjoy, maybe 50 to not.

I hadn't noticed the missing music.  Thankfully, it was nothing that is truly integral to the episode(s).  There is so much music in Northern Exposure that holds so much meaning and is chosen perfectly for the storylines.  I had noticed the lack of labels, which has been endlessly frustrating.  I don't want to have to squint or use a magnifying glass to tell which disc I'm using or which season it is.  I would gladly trade the collectible sleeping bag packaging for some quality labelling.  I have also noticed the sloppy way in which the first two seasons were put together. Neither one really requires two discs and the menus for season 2's cds are a little confusing.  And yes, the first two seasons are overpriced -- let's face it, Universal has a captive audience.

So, I'll definitely keep buying all the seasons ...I just wish they'd all come out at once!  Aurora Borealis is one of my faves , but even I'm getting tired of watching it (my VCR broke or I'd be watching my VHS tapes).

2253917,4,B0007Z2KF6,"Next to St. Elsewhere (oh, whither my St. Elsewhere?), Northern Exposure was the best show yet to be released on DVD.  Some music is missing, yes, but, guess what?  The show still rocks.  The music was wonderful, but the episode ending music all seems to be intact as far as I can tell.  Specifically I am thinking of the wonderful song that accompanies the end of the Running of the Bulls episode.  Man, that song and that scene cemented NE as THE SHOW at the time for me.

So, yeah, some music is missing, and, yeah, I'm bummed about that.  But the show is so damn amazing that I would definitely rather have it sans some music than not have it at all.  Why punish myself by not getting to see it again?  Because that is who I would be punishing.  Universal will get along just fine without my 30-40 bucks, and yours, too.  You aren't punishing them by not watching these shows.  You are only punishing yourself.

And while watching the episodes, never once did I think to myself, ""Hey, where's that song?""  Not once.  The shows are just too good to obsess over some missing mystery music.  Would they be better?  Yeah.  Are they still great anyway?  Hell yeah.  I'd rather have NE with a few missing songs than a 20 disc exhaustive set of some overrated show that I could care less about.  X-Files perhaps?

On top of that, the sheer tonnage of deleted scenes and unexposed footage is a true treasure.  A lot of what ended up cut for time purposes is every bit as good as what made it into the episodes, especially as the show progressed.  Getting to see so much new material was a real treat.

So why only 4 stars?  I want more.  I want some commentaries, and I want some making of/retrospective material.  That stuff, more than the missing music, is what bumps it down to a 4 star release for me.  The shows are still 5 star (hell, 10 star) stuff, but I would like a bit more in the extra department.",1114992000,18,1905,4.332386363636363

Look folks, I really don't care if Universal replaces some song that was playing faintly in the background on the Brick jukebox while Chris and Shelly are having a conversation.  What on earth difference does that make?  Thus far all the music that has been replaced has been for situations such as this and I, and the vast majority of ""Northern Exposure"" fans would not even notice the change (...).

If, at some point, Universal replaces music that is pivotal to the plot, say Procoul Harem's ""A White Shade of Pale,"" which Chris flings the piano, or Iris DeMent's ""Our Town"" which closes the show's final episode, there would be cause for complaint.  But for now the whiners come across as little more than ""Star Trek"" geeks who argue for hours which captain is superior or just how something should be properly translated into Klingon, or ""Star Wars"" nerds who camp out for weeks in line to be sure they get tickets for the first showing of a movie that will play at their local cineplex for six months.

I am one of those who love the show -- it's one of my all-time favorites, if not my favorite -- but won't accept a mediocre product for a substantial amount of money.

As someone else said, if those of you who love NX are willing to accept a product that does not include all of the original music,  isn't packaged well (episodes on both sides, poorly-labeled DVDs, etc.), and costs over $40 for less than ten episodes (for seasons 1 and 2), then why should Universal do anything different?  You're basically taking what you can get, rather than asking for quality at a reasonable value.

I haven't purchased either season 1 or 2, and won't purchase season 3 if it's more of the same crap.  If Universal tried to license all of the original music but couldn't, they haven't told us that.  Someone else's review said that all of the original music is on the Spanish option on the DVDs; I find that hard to believe, because if so, why wouldn't Universal also include that music on the English soundtrack?  I might never get NX on DVD, because I doubt Universal will improve the quality of the product with all of the die-hard NX fans willing to pay whatever it costs for whatever they can get.

I resent those who complain and criticise the DVD-producers because I worry that those nay-sayers will put off buyers which will in turn cause the DVD-producers to stop producing or to slow production down in a very protracted way. Be grateful for the show and for the DVDs, people!! ANY Northern Exposure is better than no Northern Exposure and ANY Northern Exposure is better than anything on TV now. I agree that in an ideal world, everything would be perfect, but think about it: would you really rather wait forever for Northern Exposure to be available on DVD to satisfy your music issues?

2253928,5,B0007Z2KF6,"Yeah, I'd be willing to pay more for fully intact episodes of this phenomenally great TV series, but I'm also realistic enough to know that there are probably not enough people like me out there who are.  During the peak of its popularity during its five year run ""Northern Exposure"" was a solid ratings hit, but its ratings were never through the roof.  Add to that a certain number of its fans have since moved on than having DVD sets with full music could well price the sets so high that there are priced out of the market for all but the diehards and there probably aren't enough of us for expensive sets to be profitable.  Sad, but that's they way things are.

Besides, licensing costs could well be only part of the problem.  It is well within the realm of possibility that Universal simply cannot get the rights to every single song because the copyright holder is not interested in granting permission no matter what the price.  Why?  There could be any number of reasons.  Maybe they did not like the way the song ended up being used in the original episode, maybe the copyright holder is somebody else from when the song was originally licensed, maybe they changed their mind.

So, with all of that let me just say that I'll be looking forwarded to adding this set to my DVD collection which already includes seasons one and two.  It would be great to have all the original music, but missing a song here, and a song there cannot distract from the fact that this remains one of a handful of greatest TV shows in broadcast history.

As for season three itself, it is an excellent season.  This is the seasons in which Chris' philosophy begins to take better shape, in which Ruth Ann moves from being merely the nice lady who runs the general store to a well defined character, in which both Joel and Maggie start showing more nuance and in which Marilyn, well who doesn't love everything about Marilyn?",1112832000,16,1912,4.526162790697675

While it is great that this stunning series is finally being released on DVD, I can't help but feel that, without all the fabulous music,  it is somewhat the poorer.

I don't really like the fact that Universal replaced some of the music in season two, but since the music in season one was left in tact and some of the music in season two wasn't it seems pretty safe to say that they simply were not able to license all of the music for season two.

The music, while always a nice addition was only on the rarest of occasions absolutely essential to the plot.

I loved the beginning of Northern Exposure. The main protagonist had a clear objective. Get back to NYC. But the main character turns into a secondary character in the final season, due to an actor/studio contract dispute, and the protagonist doesn't achieve his goal. It's a mission failure. The series ends with secondary characters who become the main characters in the final season. The ending is flawed, but it's still a great series, a great ride, with great scenery and characters, with a better ending than Twin Peaks (1990-1991) got. A second Twin Peaks (2017) show tried to make up for the failed mission of the first show.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.
