8030204,2,B0002PIKU0,"DOG DAY:

Clearly this is not Lee Marvin's most memorable role. After robbing an armed vehicle using a bazooka, wearing a suit with a red carnation, Jimmy Cobb (Lee Marvin) hides out in a barn at a farmhouse owned by oversexed siblings who abuse their help. He ditches the money in the wheat field, but it is quickly removed by a boy who enjoys whiskey, cigarettes, and the local cat house where his aunt works. Everyone is after the money they think is buried in the field.

The film has lost something over time. My bad transferred to DVD copy made watching a film that lacked some entertainment value more difficult. The film claims it was made in 1984, but it has the feel of a 1970's sex comedy. Even Lee Marvin couldn't save this film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity, sex talk.

CONDITION RED:

This is supposedly based on a true story.

Danny Cappelli (James Russo) is a former boxer working as a prison guard. He is an old neighborhood Philadelphia blue collar type guy who has some stress issue which he brings out with some early first person narration. His inability to get along with male inmates without going into the berserker mode lands him a job at the less stressful ""G-Block"" guarding women.

Gidell Ryan (Cynda Williams) is a prisoner. She is an up and coming night club singer and part owner, along with her boyfriend Angel (Paul Calderon) of an adult entertainment establishment. He is the reason she is in prison. Our main two characters discover they both like closet sex and plan their escape.

Gidell's character was not well developed. It could have used a few clever minutes showing us her crime. Russo played a fairly decent blue collar guard, being chased by an Adrian clone from ""Rocky.""

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity (Cynda Williams, some strippers with pasties)

8030205,1,B0002PIKU0,"Dog Day was not one of Lee Marvin's best films, not by a long shot. It was perhaps one of his worst films I have ever seen. I would not recommend this film to anyone, as you will be sorely disappointed with the entire cast. Many of whom are not well known in the U.S.

I give this film a rating of less than (1). For me it was a zero!

Condition Red was predictable and not a good prison film, as prison films go. Condition was shown on regular TV, and I saw it when it first aired, but was not impressed with it at all. Another zero rating...",1232150400,3,543,3.9272727272727272
