each time after i doing the reverse postures in the series, i start feeling vomiting - i do not think those reverse postures are good for pregant woman, i think sitting and standing postures might be better.",1309132800,,292,4.528301886792453
8199708,5,B000R9C0D4,"Sara does an incredible job of preparing an expectant mother for carrying a baby 9 months, delivering the baby and having the strength to carry on postpartum.  Many of the other pregnancy videos are very basic, not even allowing the HR to go up.  This one may be a bit challenging for those who have not been exercising, but I highly recommend trying and getting as far as possible, taking as many breaks as necessary.  I am a certified personal trainer, also in prenatal/pospartum exercise.  It is much more important to get in a challenging workout, even if more rests are required than to not try, or waste time on things that are too easy.  This is the best full-body workout I have tried during pregnancy.  This is my 2nd pregnancy, and I used this for my first through the third trimester.  It was WONDERFUL!  Again if some parts are too challenging, modify to a comfortable level but don't give up!",1272240000,,905,4.577639751552795
8199709,2,B000R9C0D4,"I tried this video, and couldn't make it past the first ten minutes of the first trimester. She goes so fast while telling you when to inhale and exhale and i found myself hyperventilating and had to stop. My husband gave it a try as well and barely made it as far as I did. It is just too rushed, causing me more anxiety and failure to breathe correctly. Not worth it. I will have to go find a new one tomorrow.",1261958400,,412,4.036585365853658
8199710,5,B000R9C0D4,"She does a great job in her workouts getting you in shape for childbirth!! Really enjoyed the workouts, and having the first, second and third trimester workouts! Great video's!!",1240531200,,178,5.172413793103448
8199711,5,B000R9C0D4,"This is my favorite prenatal yoga DVD (I have bought many!).  I keep pretty fit (light running, walking, light weights etc.) and this DVD compliments the regime perfectly.  I always feel like I've actually had a workout afterwards.  This is my second pregnancy and the half hour sessions are better now that I have a demanding toddler.  I alternate between the 3 different sessions (the 2nd trimester is great for my back) and so never get bored.

I've seen comments about poor production - I note I am more interested in the actual workout than production.  For example, Shiva Rea's DVD, while it is well-produced, drives me mad as it is too easy and slow.

Other DVD's I like are Dr. Christine Anderson's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga DVD (longer, was great for my first pregnancy ... again production not great) and the Perfect Pregnancy Workout (love this one).",1223856000,3,857,4.789115646258503
8199712,2,B000R9C0D4,"The production quality on this DVD is horrible. It sounds like something I could make in my backyard. This I would overlook if it was an outstanding yoga workout. But in the second trimester, some of the moves involve moving from a flat, lying position to a backbend like move very quickly, and it makes me dizzy every single time. I doubt I am the only pregnant lady this would happen to. I am a beginning yogist, but not completely inept. I liked having three workouts tailored by trimester, and the rest of the moves were good, but I wish I had purchased a different DVD.",1209254400,,574,4.4245283018867925
8199713,5,B000R9C0D4,"This is a wonderful prenatal yoga video series. Includes the three dvds - 45 min first trimester, 35 min second trimester, 37 min third trimester. Very nice having three separate videos so you don't get bored with one routine. Great stretching & strengthening coordinating the breath, helps you to feel lengthened and calmer by the end. Not too intense so you are able to complete each tape even through the nauseous and tired months. Very relaxing and natural settings.

You do not have to have prior yoga experience to enjoy these videos. Sara talks you through each movement. The videos focus on yoga postures with breath-coordinated movement (for those who are familiar with yoga, its similar to moderately intense vinyasa yoga style) rather than a yoga approach that jumps from one posture to the next (hatha yoga).

I have three other prenatal yoga & workout videos (Shiva Rea, Erin O'Brien, Tracey Mallett), Sara's is the one I prefer the most.",1195084800,,951,4.9375
