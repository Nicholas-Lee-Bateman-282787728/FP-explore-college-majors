1425398,3,B00005CC62,"Chino (Charles Bronson) has a small ranch outside of town where he breeds horses.  Jamie (Vincent Van Patten) is a young boy who comes to the ranch looking for work and developes a friendship with Chino.  Catherine (Jill Ireland) plays Chino's love interest.  This doesn't work out due to her half-brother Maral (Marcell Bozzuffi) who is the big rancher in these parts does not care for Chino.  In the end, Maral more or less runs Chino out of town.

The movie itself, while it does have some good scenery, misses and is very slow and is rather boring.  Other than the relationship between Chino and Jamie, the plot is pretty flat.  Seemed like the characters were just putting their time in to earn a paycheck.

As for the DVD itself, only the movie and scene selection are on the DVD.  The sound is mono and the transfer could have been much better (even though the back of the DVD indicated ""Digitally Remastered for Superior Picture & Sound Quality"".
Front Row Entertainment should have done a much better job releasing this DVD

Hope this review helps you.",1359417600,6,1061,4.655913978494624
1425399,5,B00005CC62,"This movie is great. I have watched it several times already. Charles Bronson plays very down to earth, shows strength, heart and love for his mustangs. There is also some romance. It just has something for everybody. If you love a down to earth Western and horses, this is a movie for you.",1326672000,,290,4.490566037735849
1425400,2,B00005CC62,"The sound is the main problem with this DVD edition of Chino (that and the fact the film is presented ""full screen""). The picture is about as good as it would be on an average vhs tape, but the sound is sometimes muffled, sometimes echoing--so much so in parts that it sounds as if they just played the film in a big room and recorded the soundtrack with the mic on a cheap boombox. But the movie itself is very good.
And to make up for the sound quality, this DVD offers an episode of Bronson's 1950's TV show, ""Man with a Camera,"" unavailable anywhere else (for now).
So, for [price range], yes. For [price]--don't bother.",1027296000,3,624,4.387931034482759
1425401,3,B00005CC62,"I've like Charles Bronson ever since I saw him in Dirty Dozen. This DVD consists of Chino and Man with a camera. Chino is a well made film with Bronson as a half-indian horse rancher. It features beautiful horses and a lot more. This important film in his career is also known as Valdez, the half-breed. The other three important characters that is a teenage runaway is played by Vincent Van Patten, Maral, a wealthy breedy by Marcel Bozzuffi and his sister is played by Jill Ireland.  Man with a Camera is a b/w TV preogramme. In it is a young Charles Bronson playing Mike Kovac, a photographer. It is an interesting TV presentation.  This DVD also contains and introduction by the great Tony Curtis and an original trailer for Kid Galahad starring the King, Elvis Prestley.",974678400,2,775,4.649635036496351

7938053,5,B00005CC62,"Although an Italian/Spanish/French production and shot in Spain, ""Chino"" (1973) isn't a genuine Spaghetti Western on account of director, John Sturges (""Magnificent Seven"") being an American (although he didn't finish the film; Duilio Colett did). More Importantly, ""Chino"" lacks the typical comic book tone and one-dimensional/amoral protagonists of most Italian Westerns, e.g. ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" On the contrary, ""Chino"" is ultra-realistic and features flesh & blood protagonists.

THE PLOT: Chino Valdez (Charles Bronson), a half-breed, runs a horse farm in the desert and is usually persecuted when he goes to town. A 15 year-old runaway named Jamie drops by and Chino decides to hire him. Meanwhile, a neighboring rancher is starting to fence-up the wilderness and Chino falls for his beautiful half-sister (Jill Ireland).

I stayed away from ""Chino"" all these years because I was told that it was a slow, lackluster and uneventful Bronson Western. Well, it might be sort of slow, since the story focuses on the characters and their drama, but it's not lackluster or uneventful. I was surprised at how good it is. The theme is the dying of the Old West and everything that went with it. Big time ranchers are moving in and fencing-off the land and Native Americans are becoming extinct across the landscape, except for Reservations. Being a half-breed, Chino seems to stir-up trouble wherever he goes through no fault of his own, which results in a saloon fight here and there. Thankfully, Jamie is too young to be bigoted and they develop a sort of father/son relationship.

If you enjoy horses you'll love ""Chino."" It features the running of a herd in open pasture, cameos of a magnificent stallion, the birthing of a foal and its life with Chino & Jamie, the bareback riding of a group of Natives, Chino's great drive of some horses into town and an unexpected horse mating scene. Fittingly, that last one is the set-up for Chino making the moves on his woman, lol.

There's also a fairly long Native American sequence where Chino introduces Jamie to the band of Indians that are basically his family. There's a sleeping-in-the-tepee scene that's reminiscent of a similar scene in ""Dances with Wolves,"" which came out 17 years later. Also, as Chino entertains the idea of hooking-up with a sexy squaw Jamies meets a sweet young thang.

Unfortunately the story didn't end the way I would've liked it to end; it left a sour taste. But then I reflected on the movie and accepted it. In view of the film's main theme -- the twilight of the Old West -- I suppose it ended the way it had to. Besides, not every story ends on a ""everyone lived happily ever after"" note.

In any event, ""Chino"" breaches the ceiling of greatness as a simple, yet compelling drama that takes place in the soon-to-be-gone Old West.

The film runs 98 minutes.

7938054,3,B00005CC62,"The actors are great and it's the type of movie I like.  The picture quality looks like a movie made in the 1920's and the sound is not much better.  If you really like Charles Bronson and Vincent Van Patten, and they are both superb actors, you might watch this all the way through in spite of difficulties in viewing it.",1387584000,4,322,4.262295081967213

7938056,1,B00005CC62,"This review is on the quality of the DVD, and not the film itself. The artwork for the DVD is just cheap. It looks like someone personally made it in 1 minute. But the worst part is the quality of the picture and sound on the DVD. It was not even close being VHS quality. The picture is so blurry, you cannot tell what is going on. The sound has so much feedback; the dialog is hard to hear. I only made it five minutes into the film and I had to turn it off. I gave this movie to a friend, who is a big Charles Bronson fan, and he hated this DVD too for the same reasons.",1373414400,3,572,3.8151260504201683
