3444049,5,B0019VM63I,"Awesome story - This is the video EVERYONE should see (at least once)
I bought 3 to pass around.
Our family loved it!",1398729600,,117,4.130434782608695
3444050,5,B0019VM63I,I had seen this story on CNN. I wanted to be able to watch it commercial free. It's a very sad but inspirational story about what all Michael went through after being wrongfully convicted. It's a real eye opener as to how flawed our system is. I also wonder just how many innocent people are in prison. At least in this case the prosecutor who had gone on to become a judge lost everything and went to jail. That should happen in every case.,1398297600,7,441,4.261904761904762
3444051,5,B0019VM63I,This documentary will stick with you long after you watch it. An amazing story. I stumbled across it on CNN and then told everyone I know to watch it. One of the best docs I've seen in ages.,1396483200,8,190,4.026315789473684
3444052,5,B0019VM63I,This story was so captivating that I watched it several times back to back on CNN.  Unfortuanely it is not yet available to share with family and friends so with that alone I should have given it four stars.,1389052800,2,207,4.3076923076923075
3444053,5,B0019VM63I,"I thought I could get to see on the CNN site, but they don't have the entire show and they are charging $90 to get it on DVD.",1388361600,,125,3.5
3444054,5,B0019VM63I,"I watched this movie in CNN about two weeks ago. Thankfully they replayed it again back to back and I was able to DVR. I've watched it 3 more times since then. I plan to buy the DVD as well.

This is the story of a man who experienced a horrible injustice. While in prison and at a moment of great despair, he experiences an encounter with God. His authentic nature is riveting. I encourage anyone to take an hour and watch this documentary. It can be life changing just to witness Michael's conversion and the fruit of his inner peace.

Love ya Michael!",1388188800,12,554,4.3173076923076925
3444055,5,B0019VM63I,"I accidentally came across this on CNN, too, and wish it were immediately available to purchase and share. Michael Morton's descriptions of his life are riveting enough to capture your complete attention. Then his encounter with God in prison was the unexpected surprise, not only to him but to us as viewers, of the redemption you feel  and understand with him whenever he opens his mouth to speak!",1387065600,3,399,4.867647058823529
3444056,5,B0019VM63I,"This is an amazing story about injustice when the system don't always stop power hungry DAs from unfairly presenting a one-sided case, even if that means concealing evidence that might help the defense. I know Michael Morton personally and the real story is how an amazing God could change his heart and remove all bitterness. You need to buy this so you can share it with someone who is struggling with forgiving. Michael said saying you forgive and actual forgiveness is like the difference between saying you can fly and flying.  Five stars is not enough, its five times five stars. Hes the real deal in a real world.

3444057,5,B0019VM63I,"This is the best movie I've seen in many years.  This true story is absolutely amazing!  I'm ordering the DVD so that I can show my friends who didn't get to see it when it first aired on CNN.  I've never written a review on any website, EVER.  But because this movie is so powerful, I wanted to post my 5-star rating so that as many people as possible get to see it.",1386633600,21,367,3.9863013698630136
3444058,5,B0019VM63I,"I came upon this documentary by accident. And since my country is on the verge of a similar crisis, it opened my eyes to see how such beautiful and rich countries can turn a shambles because of debt, political corruption, corporate greed, privatizations and a docile society. It's hard to watch what your country might become. Paco Solanas is the most provocative activist documentarist of our time and doesn't leave anything to the imagination in terms of what needs to be denounced in latinamerican societies. He provides with a social mission that cannot be denied: using our skills to leave a message of social impact to the next generations. I HIGHLY regard and recommend ""The Dignity of the Nobodies"", is a must-see and an excellent tool for the classroom. Kudos to Solanas!",1254787200,5,780,4.916666666666667

3444060,3,B0019VM63I,"The conviction of the innocent man pales compared to the murder of the second woman, which murder might well have been avoided if the authorities had functioned capably and had apprehended the murderer in a timely manner.

3444062,3,B0019VM63I,"You have to be inhuman to not find inspiration in the story of a man that was let down by the system this badly and  misunderstood by his family that willfully.  His only firewall against a noir reality of 25 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit  was his own  attitude.  CS Lewis would call him surprised by joy.  But, CS Lewis lost that debate about the time he gave up on a career in xtian apologetics to write fantasy.  So, to me, the fatal flaw in this documentary is that it focuses on xtian wishspeak instead of all the little hacks this man used to become a better person under wickedly adverse circumstances.  I would still give it 5-stars, if he would have came out of prison raring to smite those who spitefully used him but full of forgiveness for his son.",1490572800,,775,4.296551724137931
3444063,5,B0019VM63I,Excellent documentary of the strength of the human spirit. Michael took a horrific tragedy and found peace and love in the good it brought to his life.,1489968000,,151,4.62962962962963
3444064,5,B0019VM63I,GREAT movie.  True story. Real life. You WILL be moved.,1489190400,,55,4.5
3444065,5,B0019VM63I,"It moves slow at first.  But,  remember,  it is a true story.
While very sensitive subject mater,  I'm glad the director included his family members.  Yet,  convicted of murder then proved innocent  because prosecutors withheld evidence that would have set him free,  real murderer caught  and the family of the murdered wife were left out of the movie.  Why?  I want to know why they did not rejoice in the fact that the real killer was found.
The movie,  it is difficult.  It's a heart breaker.  Important for any potential  juror to see.  It's not what the  prosecutor says.  It is what absolutely is presented that CONCLUSIVELY proves guilt.  Remember,  the party is innocent  until PROVEN  guilty.",1487030400,,702,4.82051282051282
3444066,4,B0019VM63I,"Having lived during the era of Sheriff Boutwell, I can very well see how this could have happened. I knew the man personally and always had the creeps around him. I am so glad to see that good old boy politics are finally being brought to light in Williamson County. However, be assured they will never go away. So glad Mr. Morton was able to win his so richly deserved freedom.",1486598400,,378,4.338028169014085

3444086,5,B0019VM63I,"This is such a tragic story, and it's unbelievable that the judicial system STILL refuses to test DNA, when they have samples. I recently read about a man, soon to be EXECUTED and they still refused to test the DNA samples. (he has always claimed to be innocent) How can that be???? That's what testing is for...so the innocent aren't falsely convicted. I'm sure he was executed by now, because if I recall, he had 5 days. I believe in the death penalty...but there better be actual proof, with all the evidence there can possible be. Refusing to test DNA is beyond outrageous. I hate what this poor man had to endure, and the great losses he suffered....but I'm so happy to have met him through this documentary. He is a remarkable man in every way possible. It didn't say if he got a settlement, but he should have....and a HUGE one. There is a saying, and I am paraphrasing: It is better to let a guilty man go free, then to convict the innocent. If anyone knows Mr Morton received a settlement, or not, please reply below. I would love to know.",1481846400,,1048,4.435233160621761

Frankly the Judge and the DA had justice served on them. The hammer should have come down harder on them both for such a travesty of justice, Deplorable treatment resulting in a ruined life, nothing can repay this man for what he lost, Thankfully he rose to new heights of love and compassion through this terrible experience,,and new levels of responsibility were brought into the judicial system because of it. How DNA has changed the judicial landscape since it has been introduced into the system.  Very well done film Hard to watch though.",1479859200,,666,4.893805309734513

3444095,5,B0019VM63I,"I am not surprised when people actively promote injustice because it furthers their interests or makes their life easier. But when these people are part of the judiciary system, entrusted with seeking the truth, I'm amazed at their callousness. This wonderful documentary would not have materialized had not Barry Sheck's Innocence Project, responsible for exonerating 700 persons committed to long prison sentences, stepped in and assumed Michael Morton's case.

Morton may have been declared innocent, the real culprit for the murder of his wife may have been found, but for me too little was done to punish those responsible. The prosecutor in the case lost his license to practice law for 5 years, and served 5 days in jail> Surely this is not enough punishment for withholding exculpatory evidence. How about John Bradley, who blocked the formal investigation of DNA evidence on the famous bandana for 7 long years? Shouldn't he have been put in jail for a good portion of the extra time Morton served because of this delay?

The documentary fails to inform us on some crucial aspects of the case following Morton's exoneration. Fro Wikipedia, I learned that the state of Texas agreed to compensate Morton with an undisclosed lump sum for his 25 years in prison, and $80,000 per year. But did Morton's son change his legal name once more to assume that of his father's? Did Christine Morton's sister, who adopted Morton's son, formally apologized to him for her contribution to the harm and hate Morton suffered? Did members of the original jury? I wish I could follow up on this case and see how the lives of the principals have been affected since the exoneration. 5 stars",1478563200,5,1679,4.929328621908128

3444103,5,B0019VM63I,"Amazing integrity through what most any person would deem a nightmare - 25 years in prison for something he didn't do.  When offered parole, he turned it down because it would require that he show remorse for his actions.  He clung to the only thing he had left - his innocence.  In the end justice prevailed with the help of many attorneys and years of requests.

I do believe the sheriff's office and prosecuting attorney withheld evidence on purpose. No competent and honest investigating officer could ignore what was in the file so they must have made a conscious decision to ignore it and therefore did not call the investigating officer to the witness stand in order to keep the information he had from coming to light and also keeping him from perjuring himself.

What is rare, is the man at the center of this story.

3444132,5,B0019VM63I,"If you have already followed this story in the news and read every long-form magazine article about the case, then the main thing that this documentary offers that you haven't already seen is the first-hand accounts of the people impacted. I was especially touched by the interviews with Michael's former fellow inmates. The interviews with Morton's son also serve to highlight what a terrible thing was done not just to Morton himself, but to everyone touched by this tragedy. This documentary does not focus particularly on the aftermath of this case, the changes made in the law after and as a direct result of Morton's case, the Forensic Science Commission, the fallout for Ken Anderson and John Bradley (minimal as it was), or a broad examination of the Texas Justice System. Instead this documentary primarily focuses on telling Michael's story, something he very much deserves to have told.",1468627200,4,897,5.0675675675675675

This is an amazing documentary and only a person devoid of humanity will fail to be truly touched.  I think there are multiple messages here which, if heeded, can make us demand higher standards to which we all will benefit from.  Such is the gravity of this amazing story.

Yet the filmmakers somehow managed to drain much life from Morton's story. Everything from an absence of visual design/interest, listless music that reaches for pathos but only catches sap, pacing that numbs like metronome, and unimaginative storytelling choices all poorly serve Morton's incredible journey through the flawed justice system.

Between this story, the West Memphis Three, The Central Park Five, Ryan Ferguson's debacle and the Avery/Dassey case, I am all out of trust or respect for our Judicial System.  Maybe the system is not as flawed as the people in power, but many of them are corrupt as it gets.  At any rate, this documentary had a gentler tone to it than most of the others, but was just as, if not more, effective.  I have all possible love and respect for Michael Morton,  who truly understands what grace and forgiveness are all about.

Very touching story about a wrongly convicted man who was not willing to take the pardon offered him in exchange for apologizing for the horrific murder of his wife that he never committed.  A spiritual giant of a man who eventually found peace and even forgiveness toward the man who caused him to spend 25 years behind bars: watch the end credits and you will see that forgiveness expressed in a court room.

That those people responsible for hiding exculpatory evidence, not running tests on evidence, or taking shortcuts for a ""win"" rather than justice be severely punished by the same legal system they used to convict an innocent person.  Most people cannot even imagine being convicted of  a crime.  Most people are not Michael Morton.  He was the story and the story teller.  He was the criminal and the victim.  He was the man who called out to God and then allowed God to do the work necessary to open the cell door forever.  I am most grateful that when Michael speaks I do not hear rage and bitterness.

This brave man who endured a great injustice never gave up hope, kept himself busy whil incarcerated first graduating from college and then his Masters Degree and along the way found time to incourage other inmates and offer them hope as well.

The audio book incited a mixture of emotions for the wrongful suffering endured by him and his family that deprived him of relationships and a normal life.

3444215,5,B0019VM63I,This is a quietly powerful documentary that touched me to my core. Michael Morton's journey to freedom and personal enlightenment is inspirational. I look forward to reading the book & highly recommend this film.,1403395200,4,212,5.264705882352941
3444216,5,B0019VM63I,A real life story of things gone horribly wrong and how things eventually turned around.  Amazing in that Mr. Morton came out of it as an inspirational person with an attitude that I would strive for.  Highly recommend.,1401062400,4,219,4.7368421052631575
3444217,5,B0019VM63I,"Remarkable. Unpretentious. Sad and happy all in one film. Uplifting.  Maddening when it comes to our ""justice"" system correcting their errors.",1399593600,2,142,5.761904761904762
3444218,5,B0019VM63I,"I watched this true story with two teenagers.  It was as good for them as it was for me.  Not only does it give a glimpse into the harsh, un-glamorous life in prison, but it highlights beautiful traits of character, forgiveness, and the depth of spirituality that sustains this special man.",1398816000,8,290,4.666666666666667
8275357,5,B0019VM63I,Incredibly powerful story/documentary.  Can help but feel like that some heads should roll -namely Ken Anderson.  This story is uplifting and at the same time very bittersweet.,1522022400,,176,5.481481481481482
8275358,5,B0019VM63I,Watch it!  It's unbelievable how badly he was treated but how peaceful and gracious he is.  The prosecutor should be in jail.,1521158400,,125,4.636363636363637
8275359,4,B0019VM63I,"It really should be 4 1/2 stars.  This is an amazing story and travesty for our legal system.  What people might not know is that the prosecutor who was found in contempt of court for purposefully keeping pertinent information from the defense spent only 5 days in jail, while Michael Morton spent 25 years and missed his son's entire childhood!  I just can't find words for this injustice.  I am hoping that Michael Morton filed several civil suits.

Kudos to all the selfless individuals, particularly his attorney that worked on his case for SEVEN years for free.",1503100800,,566,4.793814432989691
8275360,5,B0019VM63I,"Justice should prevail among all things.  This story is gut wrenching, true and gives you a point of view you want to hear.  Michael Morton has it right when he says that God's Love is everything and true belief in our Heavenly Father will bring more peace then anything you can ever dream possible.
There are several messages here to be grasped.",1502150400,,346,4.564516129032258
8275361,5,B0019VM63I,"Sad but I think these cases should be more promoted. If I had time I would go into more about the anger I feel about the injustices that go on in the justice system......ALL Prosecutors, Detectives and police should be prosecuted and arrested for the firmest sentences found in the books or make new ones.....there are many more like this and they (law enforcement involved) should not be allowed political agendas for the future in their jobs.

Laws need to be changed immediately. More on this the next review I give.....",1500422400,,523,4.747252747252747
8275362,5,B0019VM63I,Excellent telling of a very gut wrenching situation.  Bless Michael and his family as they put it all together.,1499990400,,111,4.842105263157895
8275363,5,B0019VM63I,This is an amazing documentary. It should be viewed by everyone as you never know if you could be in this same situation or to be sitting on a jury to judge someone's life. The justice system is broken and should be viewed that way no matter who you are. There are quite a few people that should have been severely punished in this case and weren't in my opinion.,1498348800,,363,4.2
8275364,5,B0019VM63I,Excellent documentary. Michael Morton did receive a miracle from God providing the right people put in the right place - unfortunately after the reverse occurred. He feels life circumstances made him a better person. He is an amazing human being.,1497398400,,246,5.175
8275365,5,B0019VM63I,"After experiencing so many injustices, Mr. Morton is an amazing individual to not harbor any hatred in his heart for the folks that put him in prison. I'm glad that this was not a capital murder case, and I'm so thankful that the Innocence Project was there to help him get his freedom back! I wish him a peaceful, joyful life.",1496620800,,327,4.377049180327869
