8618142,5,B00FR3SNRC,"The product came in excellent condition. The dvd, photo book, notebook, and stickers were amazing as well.",1484179200,,106,5.294117647058823
8618143,5,B00FR3SNRC,"don't be scared to buy this new from deep_discount_dvd!! it's half as expensive and just as good. I received this within 5 days of placing the order with a tracking number and great wrapping. there weren't even any damaged corners, which is something you sometimes can't avoid even if you buy an album in-stores.

the dvd set itself is worth buying. you get these cool stickers and a notepad in addition to the dvds and photobook. the case is sturdy and the same size as what they use for the that summer concert dvds. a very nice addition to your infinite collection if you buy it at the right price :)",1474329600,,603,4.4324324324324325
8618144,5,B00FR3SNRC,"Package arrived within six days, very happy about that. While there was no protective wrapping, something that I was not surprised about from reading the reviews before making my purchase, the DVD was in great condition; no scratches whatsoever, and the case was fine.
Aside from the issue of no protective wrapping, I'm very happy with this.",1458777600,,342,5.017543859649122
8618145,4,B00FR3SNRC,"Arrived in good condition, but the inside DVD case was broken when I opened it, so the DVD does not stay in its place. Content is very good, and very affordable, but arrival condition could have been better.",1425600000,,207,4.473684210526316
8618146,4,B00FR3SNRC,"This dvd set is absolutely gorgeous. The cds play really well and the stickers and notebook set are amazing. However, there was no protective bubble wrapping at all. Amazon dumped these fragile dvd sets along with my father's order of construction tools. If Amazon upped their packaging, I would purchase more kpop cds...",1394150400,3,321,5.0754716981132075
