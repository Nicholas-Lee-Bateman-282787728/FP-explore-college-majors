8696217,4,B00RXF7800,"It's a shame the RSC chose to film a version of this production done on a thrust stage -- the proscenium stage version at the Barbican would have been better for film. And the sound level is poorly managed, so you have to keep adjusting the volume. But the acting is top rate.",1491091200,,276,4.226415094339623
8696218,5,B00RXF7800,"I love the Shakespeare live series.  When you go to the Globe in Stratford-Upon-Avon or in London and see a play you are immersed in the play, the characters talk to you and you feel as though you are part of the play.  In the Shakespeare lLive series you have almost the same experience (except you are not standing in the pit for 3 hours).  The actors are magnificent.  You can read the plays, as I have, but to see them acted out by a talented actor you see the nuances and the interplay by the characters you cannot get by reading.  I intend to buy a copy of everyone of these plays to enjoy and share over and over.",1483920000,2,620,4.133333333333334

8696221,5,B00RXF7800,"With the Royal Shakespeare Company performing at Stratford-upon-Avon, there is certainly a level of expectation far above the norm.  And in this two Blu-Ray DVD set, the cast exceeds these expectations.

I have never been to Stratford-upon-Avon, but the intimacy of the venue and the way the audience surrounds the stage is fascinating, and demands that the actors immerse themselves in their roles to bring them to live for the audience that surrounds them on all sides.  This dynamic is interesting from the get-go, and this cast of actors makes it seem effortless, as they are so firmly grounded in their roles.  And this is true from Jasper Britton (who plays King Henry IV) all the way down to Jennifer Kirby (who plays Lady Percy).  The more-than genuine performances of Alex Hassell (Prince Hal), Paola Dionisotti (Mistress Quickly), and Trevor White (an *amazing* performance as Hotspur) are stunning, but Sir Antony Sher is simply unbelievable as Sir John Falstaff, totally immersing himself in the role and the warm and richly satisfying language that Shakespeare gives to this character.  But the way in which he brings this loveable rogue to life in Part I is a thing of magic and craftsmanship that is rarely seen and experienced.  His performance makes you smile and laugh and rejoice in the state of being alive in a way in which few people really are  this is acting of a sort that is captivating, and it is truly delightful to lose oneself in the warm energy of the performance.  I cant say enough about how truly incredible this is  and in Part II, the delight carries forward until the end, where Prince Hal (as he ascends to the throne and realizes that to honor and serve his fathers memory, he must turn his back on his youthful indescretions) conveys to Falstaff that he will have no more to do with himI have seen productions where this came off somewhat noble and condescending, but in this production it is clear that Falstaff is hurt and profoundly surprised to find that his friend is leaving him and judging him at the same time.  And I felt for Falstaff in a way that I have never felt before, even when I read the play and thought that I truly understood what was being conveyed.  I am still struck by the emotions that I experienced here, the pain on the parts of both Prince Hal who does what he feels he must do, and Falstaff who experiences the pain of his friend leaving him behind.  It is absolutely worth the entire 6 or so hours to view Parts I & II just to get to this point and feel what these incredible actors (and actresses) have made real and palpable.
In Part II, Nia Gwynne is delightful as Doll Tearsheet (and people make fun of some of the James Bond girl names!), and Oliver Ford Davies is wonderful as Justice Shallow, beautifully accompanied by Jim Hooper as Justice Silence.  Both parts are a treat to watch and lose oneself in, and while the action of Part I is certainly a driving force, the character development and emotional connotations present in Part II are captivating.  If this kind of work is typical of the RSC when they perform at Stratfort-upon-Avon, you can rest assured that if I ever have the opportunity to see a performance in London I will most certainly take advantage of it.  This is spectacular theatre, and it is gripping and thrilling and warm and witty andwellit is all of the wonderful things that spectacular theatre can be.  This is work of an unbelievable quality, and I am truly envious of those that had the privilege of experiencing it live for the price of a ticket.

On a Blu-Ray DVD, both the picture and sound quality is incredible, the clarity astonishing, and every nuance that this gifted group of actors and actresses conveyed clearly and strikingly.  The extras are illuminating and enlightening, particularly the segment with Sir Antony Sher on the Part II DVD.  Every single bit of this two DVD set is absorbing set is captivating, and there are simply not enough positive adjectives available to convey how enjoyable this is.  Very highly recommended!",1430697600,5,4049,4.690677966101695
8696222,3,B00RXF7800,"There is a lot of hype about this production of what, to me, is the most significant pair of plays that the Bard wrote. But I found it disappointing. My criticisms will of course be swept aside by the cognoscenti but: it is TOO stagey, the performances were no more than adequate (one or two overdid it, others were bland) and Sher was far from the dominant/tragic force that Falstaff demands. Sorry boys...not convincing!",1429228800,3,422,4.716216216216216
8696223,5,B00RXF7800,I was fortunate to see both parts of this production live at the RSC in England and was thrilled to see the special edition set available on DVD. Incredible acting and some intense stage combat between Hal and Hotspur. Fabulous Falstaff portrayed by Antony Sher; other notable performances by Alex Hassell and Jasper Britton. A must see for any fan of Shakespeare and/or the RSC!,1428105600,4,379,4.846153846153846
8696224,3,B00RXF7800,"I don't care much for little Falstaffs: they're a contradiction in terms. Antony Sher is too small for the part in every sense (height, girth, personality), and his old-man's voice is not fooling anyone. But he's a good comic actor; he gets his laughs; and he's endearing the way a leprechaun is endearing. Ever since Richard III (1984), Sher's audience has been waiting for lightning to strike again. His Falstaff does not constitute a second bolt, but it's nothing to be ashamed of. And if we must have puny Falstaffs, I will gladly take Sher's rendition over the scabrous and joyless performance of Simon Russell Beale, who looked like a garden gnome with its paint flaking off.",1427500800,5,681,4.829059829059829
8696225,5,B00RXF7800,"Watching the superb new BluRay version of this Royal Shakespeare Company production of the two parts of Henry IV, I thought of a quote by the late Terry Pratchett: You cant build a plot out of jokes. You need tragic relief.  Shakespeare balances the tragic and the comic, the historical and the situational, perfectly and deftly in the first part, if a tiny bit less so in the second. Comedy is the key ingredient, but strategic doses of tragic relief move the history along and make us care for the characters. Shakespeare creates a great figure in Sir John Falstaff, and presents him in the round, literally and figuratively. Antony Shers portrayal is outstanding: comic, and often hilarious (rather than Elizabethan clown/jester funny), but also sometimes cruel, and a figure in the end of deep sadness and regret.

The true measure of this productions success, though, is in the integration of both parts of Henry IVs story through the most amazing cast, who all work together to present Director Gregory Dorans (and Shakespeares) vision. Many cast members take multiple roles, and actors portraying noblemen might show up in the next scene as carriers or soldiers. Trevor White, outstanding as Hotspur in Part I, plays the small but key role of Lord Mowbray in II. Antony Byrne impresses as the Earl of Worcester in I, and actually get three roles in II: Rumour, a Porter, and an outrageous Pistol. Nia Gwynne is touching and sad as Lady Mortimer in the first part, and plays a hilarious and sad Doll Tearsheet in the second. This is an ensemble play in the best sense.

The plays as history present the passing of the crown from Henry IV, usurper and uneasy king, to his son, the wastrel Prince Hal who becomes Henry V. Jasper Britton is an impressive King: distracted by guilt, deathly ill, and never easy in his role. His son begins as callow as can be, and only starts his journey to true Kingship by the end of the second part. Alex Hassell retains a bit of the upper-class twit through most of both plays, with glimpses of greatness on the battlefield in Part I, and with his dying father in Part II. Henry V will have his apotheosis in his own play, and Id love to see Hassell continue this role in that play. Meanwhile, there are plenty of sparks between Hassell and White as Hal and Hotspur have their thoroughly dramatic final confrontation at the Battle of Shrewsbury at the end of Part I. The stage fighting here is absolutely amazing, turning up the tension to a fever pitch, accelerating the action to its inevitable end.

The presentation on BluRay from Live from Stratford upon Avon is really special. The camera always seems placed just where it needs to be, whether adding sweep to a battle scene, or focussing without moving on the back of Falstaffs head as he is rejected and humiliated by his once-friend, the new King. When the King passes and Antony Sher slowly turns to the camera, tears streaming down his face, we witness a great theatrical moment. These two discs are full of those moments. Through the magic of HD video and sound we feel that we're right there in Stratford watching.",1426723200,5,3116,4.691042047531993
