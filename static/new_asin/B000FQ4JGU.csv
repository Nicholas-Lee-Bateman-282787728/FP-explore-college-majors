This may make it seem easy at first, but when it comes time to actually play to music you will be lost. No instruction is given on musicality or rhythms. It's basically just for people who want to clang their cheap cymbals together and feel exotic. Maybe it would work for a quick Halloween persona. But don't expect to actually learn anything.

If you are truly interested in learning finger cymbals I suggest these videos:

It turns out the elastic on them are horrid and the cymbals themselves are far too bulky.  If you have small fingers, like I do, they will move all about no matter how much you tighten them up.  A shame as I was really looking forward to adding cymbals to my moves.

The actual instruction is bad as well. She uses words or phrases to match your zill work with (Which is good) but only gives you four examples and moves through them so fast that if you are a beginner you are left behind saying ""What?""

The booklet is not at all like I thought it would be.  It is a booklet that gives you motivational quotes then actual instruction. One actually suggests that you give yourself a Belly Dancer Name.  That is instruction?  I was looking for something that tells you about posture or foot placing even a guide on using finger cymbals.

The steps are very basic and did not give me the workout other videos have.

The DvD music that you are suggested to use your cymbals with is too fast for a beginner and there is no guide as to what Cymbal pattern you use to what song.  Very confusing. But it is a good music DVD to dance to.

Your money is better spent elsewhere - this is designed for someone who just wants to mess around and not for someone who wants to really work out or learn the art of Belly Dancing.

I will be returning this product.",1250121600,2,1441,4.177536231884058
