Relive magical moments at the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria, and just about the time the chorus chimes in on ""Climb Every Mountain"", a state of euphoria likely to ensue.",1342137600,,303,4.527272727272727
7816176,3,6301862090,"Before I go into detail about the video, I thought it appropriate to give a short synopsis of her life.  Dorothy Kirsten was born on July 6, 1915 in New Jersey.  Early on she had an intense voice which only became more beautiful as she grew and began her voice training.  Finally she began singing with some top groups on the radio and later became the top soprano on the Kate Smith Show.  Dorothy's big break and good fortune was to have as a good friend and mentor, Miss Grace Moore, a well-known opera singer.  Dorothy began to study opera and eventually, she was on her way to becoming a prima donna for the Metropolitan Opera Company.  This video will confirm her clear notes, perfect diction, and intense emotions displayed in whatever role she was playing!  On this video, the opera portion with her co-star, Mario Sereni, is splendid, of course.  However, her duets with Thomas L. Thomas in the latter part of the video are not quite as spectacular as his voice could not match hers.  In addition, the film is grainy and has degraded since it was originally recorded.  Still, it is one of the few surviving examples of the great soprano performing.",1335657600,,1156,4.595121951219512

7816178,5,6301862090,"Previous to Callas and Tebaldi, there was Albanese, who delighted audiences for many years at the Met.  This rare video gives only a small hint of how she thrilled audiences.  The selections are most lighter music
(only Nedda's aria from Pagliacci representing opera) but beautifully sung even in the usual 'campy' Firestone production.",1192579200,,336,5.320754716981132
7816179,5,6301862090,"I have used this tape to stun disbelievers,  and silence people who boast that they don't like opera. Her performance here of ""Lo, hear the gentle lark"" shocks and stuns in that she begins in the most poised and arch manner, then displays technically  and musically some of the greatest singing you can find anywhere.

A great artist, in my opinion.",1153267200,,349,4.688524590163935
7816180,5,6301862090,"I must say, first of all, that I am writing this review in advance of the fact. When I finish my pre-screening review, I will order the VHS. Many years ago my wife and I had the great pleasure of seeing and hearing Mr. Hines in concert at the Second Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale. His program was in two parts, the first being composed of Broadway and Hollywood music, the second of gospel music. At this point I must interrupt myself with the comment that the only other reviewer of this tape referred to Mr. Hines as a ""fundamentalist"" having spiritual qualities. I whole-heartedly agree - and thank God for that! We need more people like Jerome Hines in this day and age. That having been said, I resume with the comment that Mr. Hines opened the second half of his program with my favorite hymn, ""The Holy City"". That booming bass voice literally shook the rafters. All the remainder of the second half was memorable as well, but this was THE defining moment. That plus his warm-hearted rapport with the audience. For me that is more than enough to rate this VHS a five-star without further ado.

7816181,5,6301862090,"My 5 rating is for Thomas L. Thomas's voice, which is as magnificent on this tape as it was when one heard him in person. Visually the tape is probably as good as it can be, given the performance styles and technology at the time Voice of Firestone was telecast. I bought it for Thomas's voice, and I don't really care that the tape is fuzzy and that the little vignettes and settings for the vocal numbers are tacky and painfully corny.

The tape is composed of excerpts from several appearances Thomas made over the years on the Voice of Firestone program. The vocal selections are varied, interesting, and good listening -- Thomas's big baritone could handle everything from his native Welsh folk songs to American spirituals to art songs to arias from opera, and make them sound like they were produced with no effort at all. Altho he doesn't appear as much of an actor on this tape, in person on the concert stage he had a warmth and charm which could capture an audience and have them hanging on every note.

I am grateful to all the companies who have preserved the voices of Thomas L. Thomas, Allan Jones, Nelson Eddy, James Melton, Robert Merrill and others like them as reissues on tapes and CDs. The art of these great singers -- real singers who sang real songs -- must not be allowed to fade into oblivion.",1127952000,,1319,4.514644351464435
7816182,5,6301862090,"It is something of a mystery that the Ukrainian-born baritone Igor Gorin (1908-1982) appeared so rarely in opera. In a sleeve-note Bob Rose suggests that he may have been a stiff actor, but goes on to say that ""a probable reason for his non-engagement at the Met and other principal opera-houses, despite his obvious vocal talent, was that he was a throwback to an earlier bel canto style of singing"". (His RCA acetates tend to support this view; e.g. ""Dagl `immortali venici"" from 'Attila' is a fine example of Verdi baritone singing, showing that any query about his acting ability does not extend to his subtle use of words). Rose goes on, ""His beautiful lyric baritone was most suited to the works of Bellini, early Verdi and Rossini, the repertoire that he was simply not given."" Indeed, Gorin, who studied at the Vienna Conservatory and made his debut in 1930 at the Vienna Volksoper, appeared only once at the Metropolitan, on 10 February 1964 as Germont (with Mary Costa and John Alexander), and his career at the New York City Opera consisted of just five performances in the autumn of 1963: two as Rigoletto and three as Germont. (He sang these two roles on television with the NBC Opera Theatre, to great acclaim). Opera companies with which he performed included those of Chicago, Cincinnati and New Orleans, and he appeared frequently in recital, on radio and on TV. The four shows on this video illustrate the high status in which the population placed him. He sings with a superb technique solid enough to be taken for granted, thus able to spend time on words and vocal shading. Here in his 40s the voice remains beautiful in sound - recordings made when he was 70+ show he retained much of the quality and technique. Whilst some material could be seen as banal, it is all performed with conviction. The operatic arias are sung as well as anyone, with ringing top notes worthy of a lyrico-dramatic tenor. For me, Gorin continues the timbre and style starting with Amato and Schwarz through to de Luca and Schlusnus; listen to the operatic arias and note long-breathed lines, dynamic changes with gorgeous mezza-voce, and well-projected words. Then e.g. play ""The blind ploughman"" for a performance comparable to Dawson's, and move on to ""Through the years"" ... very moving.",1048636800,9,2289,4.826972010178117
