7498890,1,B017DSRZL8,"Decent acting and cinematography won't save this valueless piece of trash masquerading as ""entertainment"".  There is nothing new; there are no redeeming ""lines""; in the ending scene, the boyfriend elects to arm his whimpering, hysterical young girlfriend who can barely ""keep it together""--not a good move.  The script causes characters to act in ways that reasonable people simply wouldn't.  It's cringeworthy NOT because of suspense, but because people act (or fail to act) in ways that are calculated to induce the viewer to feel suspense, but instead, we are left feeling frustrated at the ridiculous behavior.  OK, there's a blackout--does this mean that people imagine that there are no consequences for actions taken during such a  blackout? Ludicrous.  This is yet another instance in which the screenwriting and plot are given short shrift in favor of hiring known actors and paying for cinematography.  Hey--good effort.  Next time, try investing in decent storytelling and dialogue.  This could have been an interesting film.  That whimpering girlfriend should have turned the gun on herself--it would have been more interesting and I would have been at least a little satisfied.  The meek will DEFINITELY NOT inherit the earth....",1463788800,,1242,5.350515463917525
7498891,4,B017DSRZL8,"I can tell some  reviewers have NEVER BEEN in any blackout.
I have been in several....one in the 80's!!!!!!!...in San Francisco...PLANNED...most everyone knew...some work or something. About 10 of us got together....< GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD >....and STAYED IN !!!! IT was CHAOS out there...and it was less than 12 hours. Mention the year because it was a much nicer world then.
NOW?????? If they riot because there are not enough TOYS for sale at the mall????
Get a grip....but ya know what ??? yr. not gonna survive ANY blackout.
Sorry to be harsh....but this is NOT fiction, really.
BOOM...lights go out...how long can YOU survive without opening yr front door??? Got water??? Food ??? Medicine...??? TOILET paper, paper plates so if you DO have food you don't have to waste water washing them.???? In this modern world...so many have less than 3 days of food on hand, but bad things happen ALL the time.
How about the bad storm on the East Coast....in real life??? THEY had notice and were starving. Catrina??? A bad earthquake???

7498897,2,B017DSRZL8,"The film focuses on 4 young adults hiking and camping on the Mohawk Trail in upstate NY. Meanwhile, Martin (Jordan Marder-writer, producer) and his expecting wife Julia (Lymari Nadal) return to his deceased parents' home in a plot to be developed. Frank (Bill Sage) is the local sheriff.

When a poorly explained nation wide blackout, lasting several days happens, a group of people misbehave becoming looters, rapers, and killers as if this is the end of the world and the lights will never come back on. Eventually they, as expected, confront those in subplots A and B.

That's about it. The rape is implied. The killings are not very graphic. The dialogue is boring and attempts to have a theme about light and darkness with a Genesis quote that didn't tie in that well. It didn't make me want to run out and buy duct tape and candles.

7498909,2,B017DSRZL8,"This movie had a lot going for it, but it contains glaring problems that are too large to overcome.
1 - This movie takes place in a community in the New York countryside, the kind of community you'd imagine would be hunters, yet the only two people in this town with guns are the Sheriff and the survivalist
2 - Speaking of the Sheriff, where are all his deputies?
3 - This is a community that has grown up together, and they all know each other well, yet the minute a couple of bad guys show up and shoot the Sheriff, a handful of these people gladly jump on the truck and go along with these murderers because the power has been out for five days.
4 - About that - the power has only been out for five days. While that's going to cause some Xbox addicted kids to freak out, it shouldn't be long enough for the entire town to go nuts. And how much are these people eating, that they've run out of food in only five days?
5 - Yes, this community ran out of food in five days (never mind the massive corn field).
6 - The survivalist served in some war with another character's father, and they appear to be the same age, but the survivalist talks like he's much older than the other guy.
7 - When the bad guys come to raid the survivalist's home, he breaks out the heavy artillery and chooses shotguns. He has all means of weapon at his disposal, and he chooses shotguns, from the ground floor. He's a military combat vet, but he doesn't think to get a high powered rifle with a scope, get up in the attic and start picking off the bad guys.
8 - And, again - everything goes to hell in five days. That's a quick descent that makes little sense.

7498917,5,B017DSRZL8,"This film has often been in my thoughts since I watched it over a month ago. Though a low budget production, I was more impressed with it than with ""Into The Forest"" - both are good movies about the aftermath of a widespread collapse of the power grid. Both will make you think, and are bound to make you look at yourself and your neighbors a little differently - wondering about how we'd behave in that situation. I think this film deals more realistically than the other with how quickly things might get brutal in such a catastrophe - I like the ending more too - again, more realistic. It may surprise you as it did me, yet is more likely to be what actually would happen. Think ""Lord of the Flies.""

Not long before I saw this movie I'd complained to a relative about the power lines that marred a nice sunrise photo I'd taken and sent him. After I saw this movie, those same lines looked just lovely to me. Two days ago, he finally had his power restored after eight days without it since Hurricane Irma. I'm guessing he doesn't mind those ""ugly"" power lines in his neighborhood either.",1505692800,2,1092,4.405940594059406

7498937,1,B017DSRZL8,"First, like so many other bad movies, the plot and characters were written by someone with a very low opinion of women. Every female character in this travesty is portrayed as a submissive sheep who wouldn't even consider picking up a weapon to defend themselves, their 'loved' ones, or other innocent people. Of the only two female characters who had weapons put into their hands, one freezes and refuses to shoot invaders while her husband and the 'survivalist' fight for their lives downstairs, and the other one freaks out, threatens her boyfriend and the group of innocent people with him, then shoots and kills one boy. Absolutely pathetic writing.
  I agree with a previous reviewer in that there was no hero or protagonist. There were way too many main characters (seven) for this which was at least six too many considering that every one of them was too naive and weak-willed to be of any use in a crisis or 'apocalypse' type setting. The 'survivalist' was nothing of the kind. Assuming he was a survivalist, then having materials on hand to board the windows is a to be expected, but made of weak pressed board? Really? And then on top of that, not reinforcing or adding a simple cross-bar to at least slow people trying to break in. Also, what did this 'survivalist' use his limited fuel for the generator for? For emergency electrical needs? -No. For emergency floodlights in case of a night attack? No. This one burns his entire stock of generator fuel away in a short three days to watch videos of his dead wife. This is a morbid character who has no will to live since his wife died, which is the total opposite of a 'survivalist' who prepares because he is determined to live no matter what.
  I could go on and on, but I think the final insult to the movie viewers is that the power mysteriously coming back on at the very end, just as it mysteriously went off in the first place, makes the whole plot meaningless even if there had been any good plot points or direction. The only good thing I can say is that the cast played their roles very well for the characters they were given. It's not the fault of the cast that their character personalities were written in a directionless, naive, and shallow manner.

When faced with crisis, our masks come off. This is what determines what type of human being we really are inside. Someone else said that stores have a 30 day supply. Not true. They used to but , now with the advent of barcode scanners they stock only what they need to and keep inventory down to a bare minimum. The Amish and Mennonites will do just fine until the rest of America murders them for what they have. Same with the Mormons. You can not survive by yourself. It takes a whole town to come together and not turn on each other to survive. This scenario could very well come true and on an even more critical catastrophe. If an EMP hits, the power may well be out forever. Cars won't run, phones and internet won't work. Generators won't work.

7498950,5,B017DSRZL8,"Sadly this movie can come true. Stop and think, most supermarkets are suppose to carry at the most a 30 day supply of non-perishable items in a fully stocked shelves and everyone behaves their selves. Buys with reason for what they need. Also it has been said that the truth is most super markets only have a weeks worth because the supplies are only a phone call or a computer click away. Also super markets do not want to waste money on too much inventory on hand. Cheaper to buy as and when needed. Look at your medicine refills. When you go and order over the phone or on the computer you are given only a 30 day supply unless other wise requested. That is for only non-controlled medicine. The medicines that are controlled are tightly watched. How many people carry fire arms of any type let alone know how and when to use deadly force to protect them and their love ones and friends from two legged animals? All know the two legged animals are out there. And there are the two legged animals kept in check because of the thin line called the law. As seen in this movie once that thin line is broken and want, desire, greed, self preservation begin that leash is gone so too good will to all man and women.

How much people must band together to survive, to fight off the two legged animals. Learn new life skills. Just look around you and stop and think of the crazy mess, this world of ours is in now.

7498955,5,B017DSRZL8,"I agree with several viewers that the movie was well cast, acted, and directed, but most of all it was believable. I felt that the scenarios laid out for each group of people were thought through and very possible if we lost our electric grid. Props to everyone involved for making it convincible. It was worth the 90 minutes I invested watching it. I especially enjoyed that the person telling this story, somewhere between the writer and the director, showed the consequences of either not owning a weapon (prior to an apocoliptic event), much less knowing anything about the awesome responsibilities of handling one, or owning one but not having the sensability to pull the trigger fast enough in a life or death situation. Guns can save a life just as easily as take a life. It is all in the hands of the person operating it. If we are so quick to empower our children with sex education in schools, perhaps we should consider educating children and adults about responsible and ethical gun handling, storage, and ownership as well.",1486339200,,1036,4.761111111111111

7499036,5,B017DSRZL8,"I read a lot of the reviews and a lot of people say how unlikely things will go that badly that fast and I ask you this: Do you know how to hunt? How to dress and butcher an animal? Do you know how to grow food? Do you know what wild plants are edible and which are poisonous? If the lights went out how much food do you actually have at your house? This scenario isn't that farfetched, cyber attacks or sabotage could create this outcome. An even more devastating outcome would be an EMP or a CME (coronal mass ejection) in which case as stated in the film all technology in the affected area is toast. When you have a nation of people who only know supermarkets and fast food chains this movie is the result. Things WILL get nasty. Civilization will disappear. The predators will eat the prey. These are the facts. To those who think a community would band together, I say your naivet will get you and those you love killed. This movie is a cautionary tale of how dependent we as a nation are on technology. My only complaint with this movie is how woefully unprepared the ""prepper"" was in terms of firearms. The AR-15 is America's rifle and the fact he didn't have even one is kind of ridiculous although it would make the climax far more anti-climatic. The bottom line is Evil will prevail when good men do nothing. Regardless of your politics, you owe it to your family and those that you love to have some long term food storage and a means to protect yourself (i.e firearms). Call it an insurance policy or whatever, it is an investment and the people that you love are worth it. Buy one, get trained, continue to train, it saves lives. I really liked this film and I recommend it to everyone. After you have watched it you should consider what exactly you would do in that situation? A solar flare occurred in the 1800s that caused the aurora borealis to be seen as far south as Cuba an event like that would cause all current cars to cease functioning, all cellphones, all devices that have any kind of sophisticated microchip would be fried and you would be for all intents and purposes back in the stone age.

Most movies in this genre are one or two star movies and at least the acting was good.  Could have been better like instead of the teenage girls crying about everything maybe they could have risen to the occasion.  I also think it would take more than one week for people in a rural community to go berserk.  We've been out of power for a week and nobody went berserk or stole food or shot anybody.

7499147,2,B017DSRZL8,"The Blackout was disappointing.  The idea of what could happen in a small community when the power goes out is good, however, in this film it just muddled along.  Characters weren't developed enough, no real plot twists, and you never find out why the power went out to begin with or how it came back on.  Oddly enough, people seemed to have enough gas to drive around while the gas station was shut down due to no power, and their personal emergency generators run out of gas.  Then a couple of guys drive into town while the local sheriff is rationing the food supplies, kill him, and then take the food.  In the mean time, two young clueless couples, out camping, come into town and find out that things are out of control.  The story sort of drifts along with dull characters and no real dialog to make things interesting.  It's a stretch giving it two stars.

I like that they went with a more common power grid failure as the cause of this castrophe.  No actual cause is cited in the film, giving it realism.  (It would take months afterwards to figure that out for certain.)  The US DOE knows that the domestic power grid is aged and prone to the one of  highest failure rates for an industrialized nation also.

Even the build up throughout the first part of the movie was great, but the ultimate climax of the movie wasn't to the level I thought it was going to be. The bad guy was bad and the viewer knew it, but not the quote ""good guys"" in the movie, so it wasn't as satisfying to watch him get his kumuppins. Think die hard where he drops the dude off the roof. Nothing like that in this movie. Also, more of a dark look into human nature. I don't know, I just think the ending could have been more satisfying. Plus, I didn't connect too much with any of the characters. And what's with that cover? A bit of a bait and switch. That scene never existed in the movie. No little girl hiding in a house, no gas masks, there might have been a few assault rifles, but you mainly remember shotguns.

This isn't meant to be a commentary on ""rural America"" or how ""rural Americans"" would respond. The movie did a very good job portraying the fear, confusion and panic that could occur if our Country was ever thrust into a blackout situation with no contact from the military, media or outside sources. The movie follows four particular story lines centered around each individual group and how they respond during a total grid failure. I have read and seen my share of apocalyptic/disaster storylines and this was quite good. The acting and production was very good for, what I imagine, is an independent film. The ending depicts the irony of society and how quickly citizens could fall into chaos during a catastrophic disaster. Well done.",1471651200,2,835,4.929078014184397

This movie is great IMHO - good acting, good settings, scary, and you can convince yourself it's possible - like most fiction, you can come up with a lot of holes in the movies, but that's part of the fun so the Preppers and Zombie Fighters can feel better about how their supposed expert skills are going to keep them safe in a crisis.  I liked that they took out some key players fairly quickly and you have to appreciate that since ostensibly no one is safe.  I'm not at all clear on why one guy was a Prepper and they kept showing a video of his wife, they're unrelated and unexplained, but whatever, it is a fun movie, the kind where you say ""Don't do it!"" or ""Why did you do that!"".

But to me,even though its just a fictional movie,it does show just how easily,yet realistically can be in a variety of ways/scenarios,like the one shown in the film to occur,&that can bring things to a dangerous head in the right conditions. In the movie,people reach points w/loosing their sense of humanity quickly was what made this movie holding my attention throughout until the end. Although I do have unanswered questions,like the big one being,""Why&What happened to cause the widespread power outage occurring in the 1st place?""....
  I will say that given it was a B- type movie,it had good Actors(even some recognizable ones are in it)that played their character parts in such believably done ways altogether! Which is a plus in my book! I know its different w/everyones personal opinions,but I really recommend this movie &hope others like it as well!!If you liked this movie &want to see others similar to this one,I recommend ""Goodbye World""made in 2013.

For the couch potatoe reviews that believe Mayberry, Little House, Ponderosa, and Petticoat Junction will happen in the rural areas you are living a dream.....Yes, Most ppl do have rifles in their trucks, most ppl are related, most ppl have more than 1 bad apple in their kin, most kin have multiple skeletons in multiple closets. Its more like Hatfield/McCoy... Humanitarianism will decline rapidly, as unaccountable ppl already living in the country will rape pillage take over with no thought of tomorrow. Poor ppl in rural areas will have less of a culture shock. Most in rural areas have grown up with out power/running water/bathrooms..I notice my rich neighbors in a panic seconds after a power outage, whereas my poor neighbors pull out all their camping gear they use many times a yr from not paying their bill. In 2yrs since that movie release their have been rapid changes, so now we see that movie as no shock. Actually, arguments over supplies seem rather mild, as were the attitude towards the Cop. People already do not get along on a normal day in distress! As for this ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE FASCINATION...SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES/popular TV,  are desensitizing us to a reality that all those hungry ppl will be looking for food when the cans run out.(SOME scenes reminded me of a ZOMBIE take over) What will they eat? You figure it out. Most are on THE WIDE ROAD NOT PREPARING, some have taken the narrow path, learning, preparing, helping, sharing. Short read~NIGHT BY ELIE WIESEL, you will see a pattern of disbelief and a government take over. Yes that's a little beyond this movie but really not. Missing in this movie is the Govt take over, Maybe that will be a sequel when the power goes out again for these citizens.

7499280,3,B017DSRZL8,"Considering that most movies in the apocalyptic genre are pure dreck, this was a pretty good film.  It was a solid 3-star, for sure.  Get rid of the college kid backpackers (at least earlier in the movie) and it'd be closer to 4 stars, for this genre.  I live in a major metropolitan area, grew up in a rural western town 60 miles outside a major city and find this film's plot plausible.  Americans are unaccustomed to missing any meals, let alone going hungry for days.  Ever been in a U.S. east coast city when a snowstorm is forecast?  The supermarkets are besieged based just on forecasts of inclement weather.  Those reviewers citing their own experience with local power outages are missing a major plot point:  most of if not the the entire country clearly has lost power (learned via ham radio) and maybe the world, so it'd be remarkable if there was not mass panic.  Without running water, sewer and food, social order in cities would breakdown quickly and residents would leave in desperation.  This movie was apparently set in Massachusetts, close to the most densely populated corridor in the U.S.  I thought the ending was pretty good, too.  Early in the movie, at the town hall meeting, it is made clear what the impetus for the blackout was -- a scenario that America's policymakers and power company executives have done far too little to prevent.  Our civilization hangs by a very thread and when this film snips that thread, it gets interesting quickly.",1467763200,7,1472,4.7254901960784315

As far as ensemble goes, films usually use that when they're talking about movies that feature an incredibly talented cast of actors and actresses, which was definitely not the case in this movie.  I suppose they meant it more in the vein of an 'ensemble cast' which is made up of members in which the principal actors are assigned roughly equal amounts of importance and screen time.  I guess you could say it did do that which was probably why it moved so slow and I ultimately didn't care what happened to any of them.

blackout and its impact on one local area. The acting is superb and
there is ample tension throughout its duration. It bogs down a little
at times with mundane dialogue, but overall the pacing is good. The
film is a study of human behavior during a time of serious crisis and
it plays out in a fairly realistic manner. There is an obvious
anti-gun bias evident, especially at the end of the film, where it
seems that everything would be fine if there were no guns. Well,
realistically, in a global blackout that lasted for any extended
period, everything would not be fine--guns or no guns. In a world so
dependent on modern contraptions and conveniences, most of us would not
know how to survive in their absence--not for long anyway. In the end,
it is a good film, but personally I could do without the political
message.",1465430400,6,889,4.5625

7499569,4,B017DSRZL8,"I feel like I have to review this movie, after reading all the negative reviews it's been given. I love post apocalyptic, survival when the grid goes down type movies (the creative kind without zombies).  I'm usually on the lookout for prepper situations, not because of the prepper theme, but because of what prepper themes (ought to) draw out of the characters.  This one goes far with that theme and has a lot to say in a suspenseful action packed way.  I mean where else is one character going to be able to say something like ""It's not the darkness when the lights are off we should be afraid of; it's the darkness when the lights are on""?  (The actor who says that does a nice job on the delivery, too--it comes out very un-cheezy).  And no, the timeline isn't wrong...think of the crap that happened after Katrina,,,didn't take long for the worst (and best) of human nature to make itself known.  The irony is that the reviews here are illustrations of the dichotomy the movie actually explores: some people have faith in humanity (rightly so) and some people don't (again, rightly so).  Those optimists who grade this film down are obviously the faithful.  Personally though, I love the tension between the two views, which is really well explored in this film.  The acting, plausibility and depth of thought are much better than movies in the same vein that arm-chair directors are giving much better reviews (ie Snowpiercer).",1465171200,,1435,4.754032258064516

Some of the scenarios were unrealistic, but the basic premise is more likely than most people think could happen. This isn't a movie encouraging prepping for an apocalypse, but it hopefully will encourage anyone watching it to be a little more prepared to take care of yourself, or at least have a plan, in case government isn't there to hold your hand after either a natural or unnatural event disrupts life as we know it today.

The ending was a bit quick and I felt like it was not fully flushed out. I wish the movie had gone on to explain why the blackout happened, etc. I also wanted it to go a bit more into depth of what the aftermath would be for the various characters.

A good story needs a plot, and a good plot needs a hero or central character. No one is the protagonist. The second issue is that the power came on. It would be one thing if the story ends with no power of any kind, but another if it was just a blackout that lasted a long time. Also, the ladies in the film are crybabies and screamers.

Our midsize city had no rioting, no panic, no mob scenes; just a lot of people cooking on grills in the backyard and trying to use up the contents of their fridge and freezers.  Also country folk would take a lot longer to break down, they are more self sufficient than big city people and have more stored supplies.  They are also just used to taking care of themselves and helping out their neighbors.  A much better miniseries for this general concept is Jericho.

Two criminals try to rob a food supply and they aren't going to just have to shoot a sheriff and a civilian, they are going to have to shoot it out with hunters who have rifles in their cars. You aren't going to have people jumping on a truck to join them because the people around them are relatives and people they've known all their lives not some greasy-haired cons who just shot your neighbor or cousin and you aren't going to have people dependent on what is left in some small store to get their food, even today. Number three, blackouts happen all the time in rural areas. Everyone in upstate New York is going to have a generator because you will freeze in the winter if you don't. Fuel won't last forever but no one is going to be panicking in a week. I could forgive the stupid if the film were decent but the acting is only okay and the characters unengaging.

No one knows what caused it or why but they know it's all around them in neighboring cities too and has been going on for about a week when the movie timeline begins.  The acting is very good.  You get to see the perspectives of several people during this time and how they handle it.

It's primarily about our human nature when we feel threatened or scared and the possibilities of what we would have to do to survive and keep our loved ones safe.  It's not pretty and has a stark realism of the initial chaos that would likely transpire in any such crisis.  Everyone does things against what they believe in as surviving demands.

This movie gets really slow at times, especially in the first 30 minutes or so.  I removed one star because of there being a bit too much character development that didn't really amount to helping the story much.  But there are characters you will likely identify with.  Some traits in these people you might recognize in yourself or others you know.  Its a look at a likely reality none of us would want to have to see.

Overall, I found this movie to be suspenseful and you find yourself wanting the regular cast to survive.  It was rated R due to some gross scenes of violence.  Any rape or sex was only implied and not shown.  I do recommend seeing it.",1535846400,,1407,4.378378378378378
