8428765,5,B004GIJ2AQ,"This is a riveting Israeli soap opera - with a young, handsome Romeo and Juliet-like couple who are in love but from different and forbidden communities - a secular Russian ""Romeo"" and a charedi ""Juliet.""  The sub-plots involving the Russian parents and other relationships hold your interest throughout.  The series is well-acted, and hearing the Hebrew language (with English subtitles throughout) is a plus.  I highly recommend ""A Touch Away.""",1387584000,6,446,5.3428571428571425

In the past I bought DVDs directly from an Israeli distributor. Despite paying high fees for delivery, they would come in 6 weeks or more. This package I bought through Amazon, and it arrived within a week!!",1350172800,,268,4.38
