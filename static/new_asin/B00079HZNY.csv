The anime Overman King Gainer is just damn GOOD FUN.  The previous volume one started off in action with a bang and in this second volume the story continues at a good exciting pace with room for nice character evolution (with a look at Gain's past) and wonderful humor.

We're introduced to a new villian with a fierce hatred for our beloved Gain.  I don't want to spoil too much about him, so I'll just say the new bad guy is sadistic and obsessed.  My kind of favorite bad guy! Y'know like Dilandu from Escaflowne?

Anyways, the new mecha we see are awesome!  They're so colorful and fantastic. I love the animation in this anime.  Characters are easily distinguishable.  My younger brothes desperately want the mechas as toys.  So c'mon Bandai, give us a toy King Gainer!!

There are still many episodes to go, but right now I'm digging this show.  It is a good anime with good re-watch value.  It's worth the price and time.  Still not convinced?  Then rent it! This is a MUST SEE anime for 2005!",1115683200,4,1154,4.5512195121951216
