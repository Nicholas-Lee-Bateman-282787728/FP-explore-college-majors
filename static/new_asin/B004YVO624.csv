8448968,5,B004YVO624,My daughter loved all three videos and watches them constantly. Inside the pack was a card with a picture and recipe for a Dora Castle Cake. Of course that is the cake we wanted to make and now her birthday is Saturday and I cant find the card. If anyone can scan it in and send it to me I would greatly appreciate it. vtcol@yahoo.com.,1342224000,,335,4.1692307692307695
