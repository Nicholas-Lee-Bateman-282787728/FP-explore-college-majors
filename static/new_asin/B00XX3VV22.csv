8716999,5,B00XX3VV22,"An erotic film directed by Ovidie, there are many explicit scenes -- lesbian and gay, as well as vanilla sex between two adults. It's in French and you know you get more realism from actors we don't see every day. Ovidie is well know for her erotic films, in some of which she acts herself. I give it 5 stars because it's not porn per se, but just sex in its many forms. To each his own ...",1525305600,,390,4.012820512820513
8717000,2,B00XX3VV22,"The Kiss centers on Claire (Tiffany Doll) who befriends a San Francisco tourist Jolene (Madison Young) who was robbed by a thief. Claire helps this woman out, paying her hotel bill. Claire has been in a ten-year relationship with her boyfriend Pierre but it has gotten stale as they are getting into squabbles over the most inane things and there's a chance the wedding will be called off. Claire wants to meet new people; she's known Pierre since she was nineteen years old and it's time for her to branch out.

As typical of most French adult films, The Kiss is heavy on dialogue and plot, short on sex scenes. The bj scene with Claire and Pierre is forty seconds long while Claire having lunch with Pierre's parents has Pierre's dad ranting about how China and Russia are dominating the world's economy for several minutes. The only intense sex scene is the girl-girl action between Claire and Jolene. Jolene dominates Claire with a strap-on and the chemistry between the two is believable. The other intense scene is a foursome pitting Claire and Jolene with two gay guys they met in a bar and I don't think a lot of straight males would be into hot guy-on-guy action.",1520121600,3,1172,4.661835748792271

8717003,5,B00XX3VV22,"Outstanding. It was better that I expected, explicit and storyline to boot. You saw the relationship with the women coming but you never anticipated what was to follow. Glad I bought it. Want to see more from this producer.",1470614400,5,223,4.743589743589744
8717004,2,B00XX3VV22,I was thinking the kiss was a movie about man and woman.  This movie focus more on the relationship between two women than focusing on the relationship between man and woman.  Maybe more information needs to be provided about your movies so that one can decide if this is the nature of the movie that they are looking for.  I'm trying one more movie to see if this meets my expectations.,1466985600,3,387,4.422535211267606

8717006,3,B00XX3VV22,"First thing. The DVD cover has nothing to do with the actual theme of the movie. In fact, it's misleading. The ""Kiss"" that is the subject of the movie takes place between the two female lead characters ... and the ""Kiss"" in and of itself was nothing remarkable. I am a fan of Ovidie, but of all her movies (I own the Sex Stories triology and Pulsion), the Kiss is my least favorite. This Kiss begins with an explicitly erotic scene and later degenerates into hardcore graphic porn ... featuring male/male; female/female; combination female/male/female/male orgy scenes.

I had no problem with the explicit graphic visuals in the movie expect for one small problem. The visuals did nothing to explain or enhance the reason why Claire was so enthralled with Jolene's initial ""Kiss."" Other than kissing ultimately leads to the abandonment of wild sex. Yet nothing of storyline substance was provided. Claire was presented as being too nave and her boyfriend of 10 years was much too weak and accommodating. She literally jumped into bed with Jolene why simultaneously lying to her emotionally-drained boyfriend ... someone who supposedly loved her but never left their apartment to meet Claire's strange new girlfriend. It was also extremely difficult  to believe Jolene's character.  Was she simply a self-serving nymphomaniac or a self-controlled freedom-loving slut?

In the end, Tiffany Doll's (Claire) character did make me use my critical thinking skills. First, she never had any intention of cheating on her boyfriend with another man (or woman for that matter). Secondly, she knew he was cheating on her. And lastly, she was infatuated with Jolene beyond explanation. Which begs the question: who is Claire and what does she really want? This is why I give ""The Kiss"" a solid 3 and 1/2 stars, rounded down, of course.",1454630400,12,1823,5.046511627906977
