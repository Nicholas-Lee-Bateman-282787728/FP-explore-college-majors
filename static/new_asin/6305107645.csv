972037,5,6305107645,"This is the British animated version of the Dicken's classic. Alistair Sim provides the voice of Ebeneezer, and reprises a role by which he will come to be known for generations. This is the animated version produced by Chuck  Jones, of Warner Brothers and Grinch fame. Might be too strong for younger  children (under 5) due to its very ""artsy"" rendition of the  story. The images are quite dark, and the loose animation style tends to be  a bit frightening. Which is why it achieves the ""ghost story""  feeling that Dickens intended, quite well. This is one of the better  animated versions that will thoroughly entertain adults. Highly  recommended, if you can find it in print.",916790400,,680,4.810344827586207
972038,5,6305107645,"The absolute best version of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol""!  Alastair Sim's performance as Scrooge is wonderful because he brings out Scrooge's essential humanity.  Right from the beginning you can see that  this Ebenezer Scrooge isn't a cartoon villain like so many other versions  -- he's just a sad, lonely and frustrated old man who's made all the wrong  choices in his life and doesn't know how to be happy or kind anymore.  So  many touching little scenes throughout that if I started listing them, this  review would take up way too much memory, so I'll just say --- BUY IT!  You'll never regret it!",913593600,3,605,4.740384615384615

972162,2,6305107645,"I remember back in the 70's, watching an animated Christmas Carol on TV that contained scenes that I considered quite frightening as a kid.  There were lots of generic Carols at the time; live action and animated, but this one stood out.  I may have seen it only a couple of times, and then it disappeared off of the face of the earth.  In the following years, I referred to this particular Carol as the ""Lost"" Carol.  I didn't think I would ever see it again.  Lo and behold, there it was on Amazon.  Now, I'm not one to spend any great deal of money on a 30 minute ""cartoon"", but this one is worth it.  I have found my lost Carol after all these years.  I haven't viewed it yet, but am waiting for a special time to sit down and relish this treasure.  The haunting animation, Mr. Sim's talented voice, the adherance to the original story; which is rare, all add to the enjoyment of this one of a kind production.  Once ordered, this arrived on schedule in perfect condition, which was a relief considering the price.  I recommend to anyone who was a child in the early 70's and remembers this to make the effort and spend the money.  Purchase a new copy.  You don't want a used VHS tape.",1166227200,4,1189,4.278026905829597

972166,5,6305107645,"This version is a masterpiece! I, like many others have noted here, saw this as a kid on TV in the early 70's and haven't seen it again until recently. The film made a haunting impression on me. It is creepy and magical and it gives you a true feeling for Dickens' classic ghost story. I plan to show it to my kids, but not until they're a bit older. The animation has a sort of cross-hatch shading that changes with every cell, giving an unsettling feeling. The ""camera"" angles and transitions are dramatic and original for any animated feature. The icing on the cake for this version?: Alastair Sim does the voice of Scrooge, the same actor seen in the 1951 black & white film version - unquestionably the best Scrooge in the two best versions! This video is difficult to find. But if you really want it and you can't find it here, check a certain on-line auction site from time to time. Don't be put off by the lame cover art (which looks like it's from a coloring book) - it's not indicative of the animation in the actual film, which is outstanding. Let's hope ABC or Anchor  Bay finally put this out on DVD! This should be shared.",1105401600,9,1136,4.3584905660377355
972167,5,6305107645,"This video won an Academy Award in 1972 for 'Best Short Subject,Animated Film', and rightfully so. There are so many things good about this film. It was directed by Richard Williams ('Roger Rabbit, Charge of the Light Brigade) and the executive producer was Chuck Jones ( Warner Bros. classic cartoons, Grinch who stole Christmas,Tom & Jerry).  When 'A Christmas Carol' was first published in 1843 it had color illustrations done by an artist named John Leech. This film looks (to me) as if leech's drawings have been brought to life.

  Also, this film features the voices of two actors that starred in the 1951 'Scrooge' (the Alastair Sim 'Carol'), one of them being Alastair Sim himself!

  I have never seen this 'Carol' on TV except for the first time it was shown back in 1971 on ABC TV. I was a young child then and every christmas from then on  I would look for this 'Carol' but never found it . I found versions with cheap looking animation, or versions that  took great liberties with the original story. This one is faithful to Dickens.

  The only thing wrong with this 'Carol' is it is too short...22 min. Made for TV.

  I don't know why this 'Carol' isn't broadcast every year.

  If you love 'A Christmas Carol' you will love this Video.

  This is great for all ages.

  Buy it!",1101254400,7,1295,4.554585152838428
972168,5,6305107645,"The only problems with this version of the classic story - It's too short, it's hard to find, and it's not available on DVD at this time. I have a copy on VHS from ABC Capital Cities video from the early-90's, which was recorded at SLP speed and therefore loses some of the original quality. C'mon ABC, you couldn't have saved that much money skimping on video tape, and you messed up some of the beauty of the animation! I'm trying to buy this re-released version here on Amazon mostly to have a backup in case my old one breaks (plus an extra for my girlfriend and her son). Yes, I'm concerned about wearing it out. It's that good.

I have watched and studied animation for almost 40 years. There are several different approaches to animation in this one episode, all intertwined to give it a unique look and an eerie feel...remember, it IS a ghost story. This is the only animated version that I've ever found that included the hearse passing Scrooge on the stairs. The Ghost of Christmas Past morphs from a young child to a girl to an old man with multiple faces and limbs and so on just like described in the book, something that I've never seen in any other version, live or animated (by the way, if you never read the book, try it, then watch this video to see what I mean). Marley has never been scarier, as goes for the floating spectres and the Ignorance and Want children. I first saw this as a child of about 10, then each year for the next few until ABC quit airing it (why?). Even at that age it gave me the creeps. Fun creeps, you know? But creeps regardless. This probably isn't suitable for very young kids. It might give them nightmares. I'm not kidding.

Some of the most impressive pieces of animation surround the scenes near the lake in the Ghost-of-Christmas-Past segment and the entire ""transportation"" sequence in the Ghost-of Christmas-Present segment...I can't say enough about how beautifully this was done. One other sort of odd note is the limited use of background music. Most directors try to relay a feeling of fear, dread, terror, etc. through spooky music. Director Richard Williams opted for minimal background music. The eeriest scenes had no music at all, just the dialog. It works perfectly.

If only it hadn't been done for a 30 minute TV spot, minus commercial time! It was later released in theaters and then won the Oscar in 1972 for Best Short Subject, Animated. It should have been a full length feature.

I hope Amazon comes through. I ordered this special order item in mid-November but have been told not to expect it until mid-January (if at all, I presume).**

One last note -  several reviews note this as a Chuck Jones creation. That's not exactly right. He served only as Executive Producer, meaning that his production company was involved and that he probably had a financial stake. Richard Williams was the director. I'm a huge Jones fan, but we should give credit where credit is due.

**Addendum as of 12/21/04 - Amazon notified me that this is unavailable and cancelled my order.",1101081600,13,3038,4.614814814814815
972169,5,6305107645,"All the comments made by the other reviewers are true. This twenty-three of so minute classic is, in my humble opinion, in the top four or five versions of Dicken's Christmas Tale. The first being the other Alastair Sim Christmas Version (1954). This ranks up there with either two or three as the ""BEST.""
It is sad that like so many other fine versions of A Christmas Carol, this hasn't been shown very regularly on any network or cable channel in recent years.  This makes it all the more imperative that it come out on DVD.
So Goodtimes Video (or whoever owns the rights). Please put it out on DVD. It's worthy of DVD release.

It lived up to my memories of seeing this 30 yrs ago & did not disappoint me. Moving and creepy like any authentic A CHRISTMAS CAROL should be!
(Marley & the Phantoms, and the Waifs at the Christmas Present Ghost's feet may disturb small children- they sure gave me the chills this morning *L*)",1041897600,10,466,4.4941176470588236
972211,5,6305107645,"Stop what you are doing right now and purchase this rare gem. I remember watching this version as a child at my grandmother's house in the 1970's and it scared me more than I will admit here. To this day my perception of Dicken's classic is irreversibly defined by the ghost of Jacob Marley loosening his bandage and his bizarrely stretched screaming jaws. The impressive art direction and stylistic pencils make this version a must for any fan of quality animation; for example, Scrooge ascending the stairs in darkness with only his face illuminated by candlelight, the dead emotionless voice of Christmas Past as she shivers in and out of focus, and of course the feral black-and-white skull children lurking beneath the Ghost of Christmas Present's robe. Also worth noting is the aerial shot of Christmas Yet-to-Come as he stands with Scrooge in the graveyard, with gaunt tombstones all around them like blurry grey thumprints. There are lots of supernatural touches like these and be reminded it may be unsettling to younger viewers.
 The Script is reasonably faithful to Dicken's original: though abbreviated to a 30 minute time slot, the story shines through clearly. In any case this is easily the spookiest and most memorable version of a Christmas Carol.
 Take note of the scene where the Ghost of Christmas Present visits the Miners laboring in the bowels of the earth. As the miners sing carols, the flickering candlelight flushes the scene in a kind of shifting twilight. No one animates like this anymore!

I have always remembered the incredible voice of Alistair Sim and the beautiful and quite spooky animation and always wondered why the networks never kept showing this on a yearly basis.

Animation is the best medium for portraying the ghosts, and this gem is a must-have for serious students and professionals. See how human figures may be animated without being overly 'realistic'.

And I remember waiting for the show to air every Christmas,  then it just disappeared, only to be replaced with lame musical versions!  I searched countless video bins in vain, and was so glad to find it on Amazon (why didn't I check last year!)For those who take animation seriously, this is the Christmas classic for you, to be ranked with the Grinch and Charlie Brown's Christmas.

972218,5,6305107645,"Come Christmas 1971, the infamous New England Green Christmas, ABC aired a strange 1/2 hour animated version of 1951's ""A Christmas Carol"". Directed by famed master animator Richard Williams and Produced by veteran  master animator Chuck Jones (Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, The Grinch) with  narration by Sir Michael Redgrave and Alastair Sim himself reprising his  role as Scrooge, this ""Christmas Carol"" is as faithful and  stylistic as any filmed version. In fact, the atmosphere evoked by the  double-vision animation itself makes it the spookiest version told; indeed,  some scenes may be too intense for children under five. The artists' unique  use of lighting adds to the spectral effects, this film ""Being a Ghost  Story of Christmas"" as the subtitle reminds us. The artwork is  stunning: the backgrounds recall the bleakness of mid-19th century England  and the characterizations remind one of the pen and ink renderings that  graced 1930s editions of the novella by illustrator Milo Winter. Important  details often overlooked by films three times the length are included. The  narration itself mirrors the classic 1951 film version and Sim himself  lends all his charm to this remarkable picture. Why this was aired so  little then disappeared altogether is as mysterious as the story it tells;  perhaps a new generation will enjoy this as I did going thirty years on  (Cartoon Network, are you reading this?). My only regret is that it isn't  longer. Don't let the video cover art fool you, this is THE animated  version that we lost too many years ago, the one that the Academy awarded  for best animated short in 1972. It deserves no less recognition than that.",947548800,54,1676,5.069597069597069
972219,5,6305107645,"To begin with, a warning: many of the reviews you'll find here are incorrectly filed and unrelated to this remarkable animated gem.  Many of the reveiwers here seem to be talking about the Alister Simms original live  action feature--a classic in its own right and deserving of all due  praise--and not discussing this specific version of the Dickens classic.  This can be confusing and frustrating (at least it was for me during my  initial attempts to locate this lost classic at AMAZON.com).  That said,  let's proceed.
You, dear viewer, are truly in luck.  You have stumbled  upon one of the few genuine miracles of Christmas: Chuck Jones' animated  version of the Christmas Carol.  I saw this amazing presentation during its  original broadcast (I believe it was on ABC, lo these many years ago) and I  have NEVER forgotten it.  If you are a Dickens fan, a Christmas Carol fan,  or simply a fan of remarkable animation, you MUST own this video.  That it  was not immediately enshrined as a Christmas Classic to be repeatedly  viewed after its initial boradcast remains one of the great, tragic  mysteries of our times.  I dare say this version of the Dickens tale (which  I must confess I consider not simply a ""beloved Holiday  tradition"" but a genuinely brilliant piece of modern literature worthy  of all the stuffy academic consideration often heaped upon more  ""serious""-- but far less gifted--written endeavours).  I searched  in vain for more than twenty years, hoping to stumble upon the minor wonder  again.  And now, thankfully, I can share my happy fortune with you,  Constant Reader.
Rendered to capture the flavour of the original pen and  ink sketches and etchings which accompanied Dickens tale in print, this  animated version brings home the world of Scrooge's England in a way both  startling fresh, yet immediately familiar.  The fine line work of the  graphic design lends a rather fleeting, spectral quality to the entire  affiar--perfectly in keeping with the tone and context of the story itself.  I defy a child not to be captivated by this animated version's mesmerizing  visual character.  Supported as well by wonderful voice characterizations  and carefully edited music and sound, this ANIMATED CHRISTMAS CAROL should  make everyone's Top 10.  To see it, is to be transported.  Buy this video  and you will own a treasure to be cherished for every Christmas to come.  GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE!",945475200,27,2425,4.969924812030075
972220,5,6305107645,"Yes... this is ""A Christmas Carol"" and yes... it ""stars"" Alistair Sim. BUT this is NOT the classic 1954 version which so many reveiwers here seem to think. This is the 1972 Chuck Jones animated version. The animation style is based on the original drawings that accompanied the publication of Dickens's classic story and as such it is quite unique. Sim again shines in the role of Scrooge but the real star of this outing is the brilliant animation. Chuck Jones may be best known for his Looney Toons animation but this production is inspired and adults will be as mesmerized as the children. Maybe even more so as, in all honesty, some of the effects may be  too intense for young children (such as the ghost of Jacob Marley which beats anything in any live production I've seen). If you have the '54 version get this one as well. You'll enjoy noting the changes in Sim's delivery almost 20 years down the road and you'll enjoy this class production. I'll bet even Disney would be impressed.

2009 Note: While Chuck Jones is indeed the executive producer of this classic animated version, I should have given credit to director/animator Richard Williams for his essential role in this feature's creation.

Example:  It shows one scene in his school when he was a child, then immediately to Fezziwig's party, then when Belle is breaking up with him - and off to the next ghost.  There is nothing that tells us how Scrooge came to be the way he is.  For some odd reason, it shows the miners, the men at sea, but nothing about Fan.  Basically it skims through the tale.
