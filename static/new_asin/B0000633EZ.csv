7958167,5,B0000633EZ,"I ordered this video for my husband because, he already had this same video and wore the first one out. I could see his steady progress each time he did a review lesson. The lessons are simple enough that I could follow easily. I recomend this video for a novice and an intermediate player alike. My husband gave the old tape to a co-worker and he praised it also. I wish they made it on a DVD also.",1178928000,,399,4.128205128205129
7958168,5,B0000633EZ,"Covers a variety of comping techniques, discusses the Mixolydian and Dorian foundation of the genre, and covers some basic chord progressions.  Lots of good ""rules of thumb"".  I liked the clips of Ross playing the exact exercises in a band situation.  I had no real understanding of how to play funk guitar even though I had 13 years of experinece.  This was a perfect introduction, and has given me a foundation to build on.  I highly recommend this video.",1038441600,,457,4.734177215189874
