1628712,4,B00005N89P,"Okay, I know this movie is twenty years old. I know in the 80's it was ignored. I know it's not the best film but I enjoyed it. I also know I should be glad it's even available on DVD in the first place but the DVD was pathetic. I am surprised they offered the trailer but no special features whatsoever? Even films from the 50's and 60's that are on DVD have commentary. I wanted to see old interviews and updates about the stars, especially Jonna Lee who I haven't heard of since the 80's. I used to love Judd Nelson and first saw this film when I was barely four.  The DVD should have offered commentary from Judd Nelson ( it's not like he has anything better to do these days ) or at least Andrew Dice Clay. Something!  I am sick of studios shoving out DVDs that cost fourteen dollars and sticking you with an unclear muffled trailer, no commentary, no special features...nothing! Judd Nelson made his film debut in this movie and he did a damn good job. Now why couldn't the DVD live up to that?
The four stars are for the film. I give one star for the DVD version.",1072569600,3,1070,4.189320388349515
1628713,3,B00005N89P,"(Actually I give it 2 and a half stars) ""Making the Grade"" is a below-average teen comedy. The plot is paper-thin, it simply revolves around Palmer Woodrow (Dana Olsen) who is told that he has to graduate from college (Dear God!) or he will have to get a job! So what does he do? He hires street-hustler Eddie Keaton (Judd Nelson) to stand in for him and attend classes under his name. Not much substance here. And the plot isn't the only thing that suffers, so does the whole overall production value, i.e. sloppy editing, grainy footage, a heavily annoying score, etc. I myself was drawn to this movie because of the presence of Judd Nelson and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay. Both give above-average performances and do good with what little they are given. Nelson pretty much portrays a mild and more-likable Johnny Bender and the ""Dice Man"" pretty much protrays an exact duplicate of himself, except he's actually ""tame"" in a sense. Dana Olsen also does a moderately good job as Palmer, he did the best to his ability with such an unfunny premise.
As for the DVD itself, nothing special here, just a poorly edited trailer, not even a booklet! The sound is below standard, whether it's just the way the master was recorded or the remix was poor, I can't tell. But I do know that it isn't consistent and is hard to make out what the actors are saying because the sound effects and dialogue are blended together. The picture quality is slightly above VHS quality, as the picture is very blotchy and white streaks peirce the screen momentarily, it appears as thought they didn't even digitally master it, let alone bleach it. Plus a few scenes are dark and are hard to make out.
Overall, I was rather disappointed with ""Making the Grade"", the film and DVD. This is an exact example of how even actors can not save a film from disaster, but they can prevent total failure and shed some light on an otherwise dull film. I feel that should they had a better, more indepth script, they could have had a memorable teen flick. I can only recomend this film if you enjoy 80's teen comedies, like Judd Nelson, or are compelled by the price, which isn't bad and saves this one from a total waste. But saying that, don't expect a lot. For those of you who do not fit under either of these categories, I suggest you pass and try ""Slackers"". Thanks for reading, I hope this helped in making your decision, enjoy.",1021161600,2,2389,4.532407407407407
1628714,5,B00005N89P,"I was surprised to see this movie available on DVD.  It was a long time since I had seen this movie, and viewing it again brought back some great memories from the '80s.  Judd Nelson plays a street kid that switches places with a rich guy, and goes to Prep School for him.  Lots of Preppies, and laughs are what this movie is all about!  This classic was a Golan & Globus Production, which also gave us movies like ""Breakin'"", and ""Invasion USA""  If you like '80s teem comedies, this one is a ""must have"" for your collection.",1015804800,4,525,4.316326530612245
1628715,2,B00005N89P,"I picked up this DVD because it was filmed in my hometown of Memphis and it seemed to be billed a pretty funny ""1980s"" movie.
But the film is mostly disappointing, plauged with bad acting and poor production quality. The fat kid from ""Head of the Class"" was the saving grace, but most of the characters, including Judd Nelson, were just so wooden. I don't think they had a very good script to work with either. The laughs come few and far between. And Judd Nelson talks like a normal guy, but reverts to this weird Italian thing where he struts around going ""yo"" whenever a good-looking girl is around.
If you want to see a funny ""1980s"" type of movie that takes place in a school, why not go for REAL GENIUS, SIXTEEN CANDLES, BETTER OFF DEAD or SAY ANYTHING. See? I just thought of four better movies just off the top of my head.
Maybe I was expecting too much. I really did want to like it, but there are definitely better movie choices out there.",1012435200,4,949,4.337078651685394
1628716,5,B00005N89P,"For the longest time the cinematic treasure was not available on DVD, and I had to scower the internet for copies of this film on VHS. It was worth the time, effort and money because the is a GREAT film.
If you remember the 80's then be prepared to laugh uncontrollably. The Preppies in the movie will seem over the top to many, and maybe they are slightly, but not as over the top as you would think. This is so funny to see the pink and green, the terrible nicknames, and the pomposity of wealth at it's highest.
The cast is terrific, the writing is excellent and the movie is hilarious. It stars Judd Nelson, in his very best role as the punk that a rich snob pays to go to an elite and very preppy boarding school.  Andrew Dice Clay appears in the film, I think his very first on screen appereance, and he does the Dice character that he will repeat later on to much fame and fortune.  Luckily for the viewer he also does in much funnier here then he did later on.  Dana Olsen plays the rich kid who pays Judd Nelson, and after watching this film you will wonder why he never made it big.  He was laugh out loud funny.  The rest of the supporting cast is terrific too. BUY THIS NOW! You will not regret it. Especially if you remember the early 80's and you read The Preppy Handbook.  Then this film is a must see!!!",1006732800,3,1319,4.173228346456693

Or, maybe, they will just go down in history. Regardless, Making the Grade chronicles the mishaps of that zany group, Palmer, Eddie, and the charasmatic Dice, as they trapse throughout Hoover prep in search of Love, money, and those last 11 minutes on the hour. In addition, the sound track by Shandi brings such incredible emotional swells that one can only be reduced to tears. Even if you aren't a fan of 80s B movie genre, you find a loveable cast carving out shards of humanity in a humanistic drama wrought by cunning deception and vengeful greed. A great movie depicting a classic era. Its also a great educational film. Quotes like ""remember, its almost NEVER the letter E"" got me through a prestigious medical school. Give this one time, its an acquired taste, like Brie. You will love it.",999216000,8,980,4.909638554216867
1628718,5,B00005N89P,"There are movies you watch that you know are ""great"" movies, but you love them for different reasons. It is no exaggeration to say that ""Making the Grade"", along with ""Strange Brew"", is a movie that encapsulates 80's movies for me. I am hardly a big Judd Nelson fan, though I now realize he did a better job with this role than I originally thought, and the love interest, Jonna Lee, is cute but hardly memorable. But every other cast member in this movie is a riot and the screenwriter, Dana Olsen, steals the show as preppie slob Palmer Woodrow III. For quotability, it ranks up there with WKRP and Seinfeld- no joke.

1628724,3,B00005N89P,"When we first got a VCR in the mid 80s or so, I distinctly remember that 'Making The Grade' was among some of the first movies we ever rented for this newfangled invention. A momentous occasion firmly etched into my memory. So, the movie has that built in nostalgia going for it. However, having just seen the movie for the first time in 2 decades or more, I was happy to discover that it is more than just pure nostalgia (although it is that), but a thoroughly enjoyable, charming comedy.

Palmer Woodrow (Dana Olsen) is a rich, spoiled, privileged young man. He would much rather lay about and party than anything else. But when his father orders him to attend Hoover Academy, Palmer has other ideas. He hires street kid Eddie Keaton (Judd Nelson) to take his place at the academy, while he goes to Europe. Eddie gets $10,000 dollars to make sure that Palmer graduates. This is a perfect situation for Eddie. He gets money and a hiding place from the Dice Man (Andrew ""Dice"" Clay), who's looking to collect. In the process, Eddie falls in love and rocks the campus.

The 80s comedy youth movie was powerful in the 80s. Not to mention a lot of fun. The decade was full of them. ""Making The Grade"" may not re-invent the wheel or have some different, fresh approach to the 80s youth/school comedies, but it is a delightful and insanely watchable movie. A nice addition to the genre. Coming just before his big breakthrough hits in ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""St. Elmo's Fire"", Judd Nelson is very charming and appealing and you can easily see his star power in the making. His entrance to the academy is cool and memorable. Other familiar faces in the movie include Gordon Jump (""WKRP In Cincinnati"") and Dan Schneider (""Head Of The Class"" and ""Better Off Dead""). The movie has many memorable and quotable lines and scenes that I instantly remembered but could never remember what movie to fit it with. It's a competent and solid movie that has laughs, memorable dialogue, fun lead characters, and a fine cast. Different identities, wooing the beautiful girl, and facing up to the truth is not a new storyline. 'Making The Grade' makes it feel like it doesn't matter because it's just fun. It's well written, solidly directed, and you like most of the characters. Why Dana Olsen, who plays Palmer Woodrow, didn't appear in more 80s fare, I will never know. He did, however, go on to write the 1989 Tom Hanks film, ""The Burbs"".

It's not some sophmoric fun filled with T&A. It's not ""Porky's"". Sadly, when it does come to this movie, it is hardly remembered or mentioned when it comes to 80s youth comedies. It's horribly overlooked and just not appreciated enough and that needs to change. For anyone interested in these types of movies from the 80s, I highly recommend it. It's one of those lost movies of it's time that deserves more recognition amongst those other more famous young 80s movies.",1357603200,,2894,4.659491193737769

1628730,5,B00005N89P,"I remember being so happy they finally released this hilarious movie on dvd. It's such a classic cheesy-in-a-good-way 80's flick that I can and do watch it over and over again. Judd Nelson has that rare talent for playing many different types of characters and he did so throughout his brief career as an A list movie star. Playing con man Eddie Keaton as well as bully John Bender in The Breakfast Club then playing straight-laced Alec Newberry in St. Elmo's Fire, nerdy Phillip the Groover in Fandango, he also starred in From the Hip, Billionaire Boys Club, Relentless, New Jack City and a forgettable movie, Blue City, with Ally Sheedy that I didn't even bother seeing. Then his career seemed to falter and he was never the same. As much as I loved his Brat Pack movies, this pre-Brat Pack movie is my fave. Not only is he adorable but also funny. The scene where he struts into his dorm is classic- especially when he checks the pay phone for a possible left-over coin. But it isn't just his movie. Palmer Woodrow is a classic character and Dana Olsen is great as this lazy slob who's always up for anything and has a sense of humor about everything. Shame on the movie company though for teasing us that we would see more Palmer and Eddie in a movie titled Tourista that never came out. Shame on the movie company also for giving us great music but no soundtrack on cd so we could play it. The two songs by Shandi were great. One thing I couldn't understand was the Jonna Lee appeal. Her character and she herself were boring. The plot of the movie was complicated enough to be funny but not so convoluted that we were scratching our heads trying to figure it out. The coach and the Diceman (in his first appearance as his alter ego) were amusing too. Judd Nelson and Dana Olsen were so great in this movie that I really wish a sequel had been made. And a soundtrack. This movie is silly for sure but good fun and a definite 80's classic. I would also liked to have seen some bonus stuff on the dvd like maybe a commentary with any of the actors. It's always fun to know some behind-the-scenes factoids or trivia that only those on the set could provide.

1628736,4,B00005N89P,"It has been said that there is nothing new under the sun.  In fact, it has been postulated that in the entirety of the cosmos, there exists no more than 135 comedy ""situations"".  Making the Grade makes use of number 97--""the old switcheroo"". Poor kid and rich kid trade places and mirth ensues.  Period.  The rest of the ""plot"" is incidental.  In the case of this particular movie, classes collide at an uppercrust prep school and it becomes painfully obvious that this film's entire raison d'etra is to pander to a generation of Lisa Birnbach desciples who think the ""preppy"" culture is a fad.

In general, the acting is lackluster--with the one shining exception of Dan Schnieder, sadly now known as ""the fat kid"" from Head of the Class.  Production values are practically non-existant.  The movie does feature a few notable one-liners that raise a chuckle or two, but thats about it.

The irony is, I love this film!  I liken Making the Grade to the popular wedding hors d'oeuvre, Rumaki.  I hate chicken liver, I hate water chestnuts and I am only marginal about bacon--but I love Rumaki!  Go figure.  This movie strikes me in the same way--I despise most of the ingredients, but I can view the outcome over and over.

All in all, Making the Grade fulfills all the requirements I seek in a movie:  i.e. it entertains.  As an added bonus, it takes me back to a time when the collar on my pink polo shirt stood straight up and I wore penny loafers with bermuda shorts.
