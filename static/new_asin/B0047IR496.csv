8418226,5,B0047IR496,The Verminators series is great and the first one is no exception! I got these videos for to help me improve my calling skills and to get set ideas for stand set ups. This video delivers all of that and more. Randy Anderson and his guys are hilarious and you'll learn a lot from watching them. Enjoy!,1453680000,,300,4.280701754385965
