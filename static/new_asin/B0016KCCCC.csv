3157348,5,B0016KCCCC,"Hammer Studios is known for its particular brand of horror films, but in the early sixties they also ventured into the realm of adventure. Four of those titles are included here. PIRATES OF BLOOD RIVER is a swashbuckling potboiler, with Christopher Lee as a one-eyed pirate, and Sinbad's Kerwin Matthews as the persecuted hero who saves the town that rejected him from treasure seeking mauraders.

DEVIL-SHIPS PIRATES has a clever premise, a Spanish privateer that sailed with the Armada runs ashore near a small and remote British town and terrorizes the populace, tricking the hapless villagers into believing (at least for a while) that the Armada defeated the British navy and the rest of England is now occupied by the victorious Spaniards. This clever IT HAPPENED HERE touch from screenwriter Jimmy Sangster makes DEVIL-SHIP special, as does Christopher Lee's performance as the absolute nastiest villian he's ever played in his long and distinguished career.

Two dark masterpieces are on the second disk. THE TERROR OF THE TONGS, with Christopher Lee as the evil head of the Red Dragon Tongs, is set in nineteenth century Hong Kong. When the Red Dragons murder a British sea captain's teenaged daughter, they unleash a reckoning they never imagined.

The second film on disk two is STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY, the ""true"" story of the Kali Cult in India. This film is the only black and white entry in this set and it stars no major Hammer actors, yet you'll be rivited by a suspenseful story that really draws you in. Though this was made decades ago, be warned, STRANGLERS is not for the faint of heart. This story was ""remade"" in the 1980s with James Ivory behind the camera and Pierce Brosnan in front of it, titled THE DECEIVERS.

Jimmy Sangster, Hammer's premier screenwriter, offers commentary, along with a Hammer film historian. Trailers are included, along with some wacky supplemental material. The widescreen transfers are excellent on all four films. Kuddos to Sony Home Video for this release. Now, guys, when are you going to release THE GORGON on DVD?",1213315200,42,2068,4.9855072463768115

3157380,4,B0016KCCCC,"ICONS OF ADVENTURE is a two DVD set from Sony Pictures (current owner of Columbia Pictures who released the films included here) that offers 4 action/adventure movies from Hammer Films made in the early 1960s. They are making their first DVD appearance. Other DVDs available in the ICONS series of Hammer films include ICONS OF HORROR which contains TWO FACES OF DR. JEKYLL / CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB & THE GORGON / SCREAM OF FEAR as well as ICONS OF SUSPENSE which features 6 B&W titles led by the 1960 THESE ARE THE DAMNED. All are worth checking out and having if you're a Hammer fan. For the record there is also an ICONS OF SCI-FI disc devoted to Toho Studio's early Japanese Monster films from the same era. For the purposes of this review, I'll pass on the 2 pirate movies included (the main reason they were included in this set was to cash in on the success of the Johnny Depp PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN franchise) and focus on the two exotic adventures set in the Far East.

THE TERROR OF THE TONGS is a well made, colorful programmer from 1961 that is set in 1910 Hong Kong. An English ship's captain (Geoffrey Toone) seeks to avenge the murder of his daughter by the Red Dragon Tong, a secret society rather like a Chinese Cosa Nostra headed up by Christopher Lee (preparing for his Fu Manchu roles later in the decade). Most of Hammer's stock company at that time (Ewen Solon, Roger Delgado, Charles Lloyd Pack) are seen in oriental make-up playing Chinese characters. In these politically correct times, this offends a number of people but it really shouldn't as these aren't really characters but vessels to move the plot forward and there's no attempt to make the make-up realistic. Think Gilbert & Sullivan's THE MIKADO. French actress Yvonne Monlaur (BRIDES OF DRACULA) is the exotic Hammer lovely this time around and she's about as Chinese as the Eiffel Tower. The set design by Hammer regular Bernard Robinson is fabulous and adds to the fun. TONGS is basically a B movie serial given an A picture treatment and should be thought of as such. Disposable entertainment that's remarkably entertaining.

THE STRANGLERS OF BOMBAY is a different matter. Instead of exotic and colorful, it's very grim and monochromatic (it's even shot in B&W) as it relates to the Thugee cult in India in the 19th century. This is probably the most sadistic film that Hammer ever made as it contains numerous burnings and mutilations which, for the time, are graphically visualized. Much like TONGS where a single British officer stands up against an organization's brutalities, STRANGLERS features an army captain (Guy Rolfe, best known for William Castle's MR SARDONICUS) who takes on the murderous cult when his superiors won't. There is also a strong anti-colonial feel to the film as it criticizes how the British ran India. One British officer gets himself and his retinue killed because of his rank stupidity. As this film is directed by Terence Fisher who did most of Hammer's FRANKENSTEIN & DRACULA films, good will ultimately triumph over evil but at a heavy cost. There's no question that this film heavily influenced Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM. Much darker than TONGS, STRANGLERS is loaded with images that are hard to erase.",1381190400,3,3261,4.800711743772242
3157381,5,B0016KCCCC,"Although I vastly prefer the '50s and '60s Hammer monster movies, I have to admit that these old Hammer adventure films are delightful fun and full of surprises for the uninitiated (like me).  For example, I was blown away when, as my wife and I were watching ""The Terror of the Tongs"", suddenly Yvonne Monlaur appears, decked out in a nice, slinky 1950s-style Chinese dress!  Fantastic!  And she stays around nearly the whole movie!  In full color!  And several other members of the Hammer gang, including Oliver Reed, can be spotted here and there in the set.  I enjoyed all of the movies, but seeing Monlaur, and hearing her beautiful French accent in ""The Terror of the Tongs"", was the real treasure for me.  Thank you, Sony!

Mr. LEE reminded me a little of Frank Langella in CUTTHROAT ISLAND. The other two were well made drama/suspence movies with good acting, well thought plots and plenty of action.

The fourth film (Stranglers of Bombay--the only one of the three in b&w) is less enjoyable and doesn't have Lee in it, but is still fun.

A major flaw of this films is the casting of Europeans as Asians while actual Asian performers are forced to stand around as extras.  It's a sad commentary on the times and how racist we were not too long ago . . .",1274832000,2,605,4.327433628318584

3157411,4,B0016KCCCC,"Although this set contains 4 movies, I bought it for 2, specifically Terror of the Tongs and Stranglers of Bombay, as these fit as easily into the ""Hammer Horror"" collection as in the adventure collection, which I find less interesting. Both films are in fine condition, and in Tongs, it is great to see Christopher Lee in yet another villainous role. Some of the gruesomeness is surprising given the British Board of Film Censors' attitude toward these films, particularly shots of cut -off hands in Stranglers, making me wonder if this is a restoration or the original release. The censorship applied to Tongs results in its being fairly tame, as discussed in detail in the excellent book Hammer Films: The Bray Studios Years. For Hammer collectors, this set is a must-have. Others might find it less interesting.",1216944000,2,815,4.956204379562044
3157412,4,B0016KCCCC,"That caveat aside, this is a rather splendid set of four of Hammer's adventure films of the Sixties with a nice array of extras - including audio commentaries on all four films - and trailers to compliment the fine widescreen transfers.

The Pirates of Blood River is infamous as the pirate movie that takes place entirely on land (well, you do at least see a ship at sea from the shore). Kerwin Matthews is the rebellious youth trying to bring moderation to the fiercely religious island community of exiles who finds an even bigger problem when Christopher Lee and his band of pirates land on the island in search of the founding fathers' hidden treasure, and aren't too bothered by how many villagers have to die finding it. Sporting an eye patch, a good accent that strangely makes him sound like a French Max Von Sydow and a henchman called Hench, Lee is a villain so cool he doesn't even sweat, and if the movie isn't a great high adventure it's an entertaining programmer. A problem picture for Hammer, who couldn't decide whether to go for a restrictive X or a general U certificate, it went back and forth with the censors several times (the main casualty was the amount of blood in the water after the piranhas lunch on one character). None of the censor trims have been restored here, but the film boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.

The Devil-Ship Pirates is an entertaining pirate romp from Hammer that's a part of studio legend. Hammer built a Spanish pirate ship for the film planning to reuse it on other pictures. Unfortunately, it was a death trap - the woodwork was so bad the decks would give way under people's feet and it was so unseaworthy that even in calm landlocked waters the thing would capsize, nearly drowning cast and crew. Things got so bad that even the parsimonious Hammer burnt it for real in the final scenes!
The film itself isn't as good as the story behind it, but it's a neat premise - the crew of Christopher Lee's Spanish privateer convince a small village that the Spanish Armada defeated the British to give them time to make repairs - well executed and an entertaining enough way to fill an hour-and-a-half on a Sunday afternoon.

It's all too easy to understand why Terror of the Tongs is such a rarity now - forget the political incorrectness, the most terrible thing about it is the sheer tedium. One brief scene of mild off-screen torture, a couple of badly choreographed fights and a LOT of sitting around talking to French or Irish actors pretending to be Chinese makes for a very, very long 80 minutes. Lee is mostly inert throughout the movie and has little to do, leading lady's Yvonne Monlaur's thick French accent and bad makeup make a mockery of her every scene and a plot which somehow manages to mix revenge, opium (""the pipe of dreams""), brothels, corruption, secret societies and murder and do nothing of even the remotest interest with them leaves you wondering how many irreplaceable body cells died while you were watching. The only pluses are Arthur Grant's photography and Bernard Robinson's typically beautiful production design and sets, both better than anything you'll see in even the best of Harry Allan Towers' superior Fu Manchu series, but other than that the most memorable thing in the film for me was the curious fact that, made up as a Chinaman, Marne Maitland looks just like my dog - and I don't think she'd be flattered by the comparison!

Only the existence of 'George and Mildred' stops this from being one of Hammer's very, very worst. Dull, but don't let that put you off the set - it's more than worth it for the other films.

The Stranglers of Bombay is much more like it. Directed by Terence Fisher at the peak of his powers, it's slightly more accurate than expected - some research has been done into the Thugs, which is more than can be said for Gunga Din - but is still closer in tone to Victorian melodrama than history. Guy Rolfe is typically laid back as the officer trying to persuade the apathetic East India Company to investigate a series of disappearances only to be ignored and ultimately replaced by the a particularly idiotic candidate who went to the right school. Investigating on his own, he soon comes up against the followers of Kali, with results that should entertain anyone who likes Fu Manchu and his ilk. It's particularly interesting just how critical the film is of the British mismanagement of India - although more an Old Boys' network here than the otherwise unemployable dregs of the Empire that made up the Honorable Company's ranks overseas in reality, rather than agents of civilisation, their concern is purely with the bottom line. It's a fast-paced 80 minutes with many of the usual 'British' suspects - George Pastell, Roger Delgado, Tutte Lemkow and Marne Maitland - in black face in the supporting cast, and better production values than you might expect from the obviously low budget.

It's strange that the film is such a rarity since there are many more politically incorrect films still in circulation: maybe its down to the controversy that greeted it on its first release. Nonetheless, well worth a look if it crosses your path, especially in a good widescreen transfer in its original 'StrangloScope!'",1216944000,8,5243,4.737130339539978

With great fencing sword duals and action.
 The second movie is :Devil-Ship Pirates"" he is a Privateer, a real dreadful and caning one, with real galleon and great cinematography and swashbuckling action.
Disc 2: ""Terror of the Tongs"", a great perphomence by Lee as the Tong Lords,
with great peices of sets and art.
 The second movie is ""Stranglers of Bombay"" a real deal masetpeice, tells the true story behind the Tuggee cult the follower of Kali, that inspired Steven Spilberg and rinvent the stry with Indiana Jones and the Temlpe of Doom.
It's just outstanding lovely set that you can own from the Hammer Productions Library.
The picture quality of all 4 movies is the best out there you ever can get it, colours are strong with great contrast you can't even compare it with today's new released movies on DVD. They are made in High Definition Masters, with bautifull anmorphic widescreen presentation.

I carriage Sony to release sooner the other Columbia titles, from the Hammer Production on DVD, just right after their planned Icons of Horror set, and to do their justice same as on the Icons of Adventure Set.
My suggestions:
""Icons of Sin-Fic/Historical Adventure""

Disc two: ""Scarlet Blade"" double with ""Brigand of Kandahar"".

This movie is shot in black-and-white and runs for 80 minutes. As I mentioned, this is a Hammer Studios film. It was directed by Terrence Fisher and conveys a sort of story about the Thuggees of India, a murderous religious cult.

Guy Rolfe plays Captain Harry Lewis, a seasoned British officer who trys to persuade the East India Company to investigate a situation where people have disappeared -- he is ignored. Lewis is replaced by an incompetent for all his troubles so he investigates the matter on his own. George Pastell plays the role of the High Priest of Kali.

The big picture is that this is yet another story of British mis-management of one of its colonies, in this case, India.

3157419,5,B0016KCCCC,"Okay, perhaps I am exaggerating, but Sangster is a marvelously inventive and imaginative screenplay writer.  If not all his history or horror is real, it's also never dull.

Three of the films in this set were written by Sangster, and they're on a creative par with the rest of his work. Stories come to the point right away, have plenty of action, and conversations are literate but brief.

My favorite of these four films is Terror of the Tongs.  The story of one man attempting to penetrate a large and well-organized conspiracy of terrorists may not seem too likely, but this film is so well made that any disbelief gets suspended right away. The story is very tight and moves quickly.  Sure, nobody who plays Chinese is actually Chinese, but I don't think any offense was meant. It would be well to remember that this was made in an era when actors like Victor Mature played Native Americans.  (It would be years before the industry began to make smarter  casting choices such as Robert Redford as Denys Finch Hatton in Out of Africa.)

The two swashbucklers, Pirates of Blood River and Devil-Ship Pirates, are both highly enjoyable.  There are a few scenes from Blood River that, in composition and color, resemble some of the outstanding N.C. Wyeth or Howard Pyle pirate paintings.  Both films have a great look about them, and a major reason is the presence of Christopher Lee. Whether the part calls for elegant or basic costume, with eye patch or without, Christopher Lee is what pirate captains are supposed to look like.

The Stranglers of Bombay is indeed similar to the Pierce Brosnan film The Deceivers, as the other reviewer mentioned.  I do not claim to know anything of terrorist methods other than what I've seen on the news, but if my understanding is correct in even a limited way, then Stranglers of Bombay shows that terrorist tactics of the 19th century have some overlapping with those of the 21st century.  This is another depiction, like Terror of the Tongs, of how one man tries to uncover the secrets of an organization which has thrived on murder, fear, and silence.  For one man to penetrate such a conspiracy may not be quite believable but writer David Z. Goodman (whose writing here is as good as Sangster's) makes a strong case that it could have happened. Of course, budget and dramatic considerations enter into this, but again, it's terrific work by all concerned.

Three films have great color and Stranglers has glorious black and white.
All have excellent picture detail.  Also, there are numerous extras. Chapter 1 of the serial Great Adventures of Captain Kidd is a don't miss.
It's more skillfully made than Ed Wood's films, but not by much.",1213660800,3,2685,4.766738660907127

Both films are in fine condition, and in Tongs, it is great to see Christopher Lee in yet another villainous role. Some of the gruesomeness is surprising given the British Board of Film Censors' attitude toward these films, particularly shots of cut -off hands in Stranglers, making me wonder if this is a restoration or the original release. The censorship applied to Tongs results in its being fairly tame, as discussed in detail in the excellent book Hammer Films: The Bray Studios Years. For Hammer collectors, this set is a must-have. Others might find it less interesting.",1216944000,2,815,4.956204379562044
3391909,4,B0016KCCCC,"That caveat aside, this is a rather splendid set of four of Hammer's adventure films of the Sixties with a nice array of extras - including audio commentaries on all four films - and trailers to compliment the fine widescreen transfers.

The Pirates of Blood River is infamous as the pirate movie that takes place entirely on land (well, you do at least see a ship at sea from the shore). Kerwin Matthews is the rebellious youth trying to bring moderation to the fiercely religious island community of exiles who finds an even bigger problem when Christopher Lee and his band of pirates land on the island in search of the founding fathers' hidden treasure, and aren't too bothered by how many villagers have to die finding it. Sporting an eye patch, a good accent that strangely makes him sound like a French Max Von Sydow and a henchman called Hench, Lee is a villain so cool he doesn't even sweat, and if the movie isn't a great high adventure it's an entertaining programmer. A problem picture for Hammer, who couldn't decide whether to go for a restrictive X or a general U certificate, it went back and forth with the censors several times (the main casualty was the amount of blood in the water after the piranhas lunch on one character). None of the censor trims have been restored here, but the film boasts a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.

The Devil-Ship Pirates is an entertaining pirate romp from Hammer that's a part of studio legend. Hammer built a Spanish pirate ship for the film planning to reuse it on other pictures. Unfortunately, it was a death trap - the woodwork was so bad the decks would give way under people's feet and it was so unseaworthy that even in calm landlocked waters the thing would capsize, nearly drowning cast and crew. Things got so bad that even the parsimonious Hammer burnt it for real in the final scenes!
The film itself isn't as good as the story behind it, but it's a neat premise - the crew of Christopher Lee's Spanish privateer convince a small village that the Spanish Armada defeated the British to give them time to make repairs - well executed and an entertaining enough way to fill an hour-and-a-half on a Sunday afternoon.

It's all too easy to understand why Terror of the Tongs is such a rarity now - forget the political incorrectness, the most terrible thing about it is the sheer tedium. One brief scene of mild off-screen torture, a couple of badly choreographed fights and a LOT of sitting around talking to French or Irish actors pretending to be Chinese makes for a very, very long 80 minutes. Lee is mostly inert throughout the movie and has little to do, leading lady's Yvonne Monlaur's thick French accent and bad makeup make a mockery of her every scene and a plot which somehow manages to mix revenge, opium (""the pipe of dreams""), brothels, corruption, secret societies and murder and do nothing of even the remotest interest with them leaves you wondering how many irreplaceable body cells died while you were watching. The only pluses are Arthur Grant's photography and Bernard Robinson's typically beautiful production design and sets, both better than anything you'll see in even the best of Harry Allan Towers' superior Fu Manchu series, but other than that the most memorable thing in the film for me was the curious fact that, made up as a Chinaman, Marne Maitland looks just like my dog - and I don't think she'd be flattered by the comparison!

Only the existence of 'George and Mildred' stops this from being one of Hammer's very, very worst. Dull, but don't let that put you off the set - it's more than worth it for the other films.

The Stranglers of Bombay is much more like it. Directed by Terence Fisher at the peak of his powers, it's slightly more accurate than expected - some research has been done into the Thugs, which is more than can be said for Gunga Din - but is still closer in tone to Victorian melodrama than history. Guy Rolfe is typically laid back as the officer trying to persuade the apathetic East India Company to investigate a series of disappearances only to be ignored and ultimately replaced by the a particularly idiotic candidate who went to the right school. Investigating on his own, he soon comes up against the followers of Kali, with results that should entertain anyone who likes Fu Manchu and his ilk. It's particularly interesting just how critical the film is of the British mismanagement of India - although more an Old Boys' network here than the otherwise unemployable dregs of the Empire that made up the Honorable Company's ranks overseas in reality, rather than agents of civilisation, their concern is purely with the bottom line. It's a fast-paced 80 minutes with many of the usual 'British' suspects - George Pastell, Roger Delgado, Tutte Lemkow and Marne Maitland - in black face in the supporting cast, and better production values than you might expect from the obviously low budget.

It's strange that the film is such a rarity since there are many more politically incorrect films still in circulation: maybe its down to the controversy that greeted it on its first release. Nonetheless, well worth a look if it crosses your path, especially in a good widescreen transfer in its original 'StrangloScope!'",1216944000,8,5243,4.737130339539978

With great fencing sword duals and action.
 The second movie is :Devil-Ship Pirates"" he is a Privateer, a real dreadful and caning one, with real galleon and great cinematography and swashbuckling action.
Disc 2: ""Terror of the Tongs"", a great perphomence by Lee as the Tong Lords,
with great peices of sets and art.
 The second movie is ""Stranglers of Bombay"" a real deal masetpeice, tells the true story behind the Tuggee cult the follower of Kali, that inspired Steven Spilberg and rinvent the stry with Indiana Jones and the Temlpe of Doom.
It's just outstanding lovely set that you can own from the Hammer Productions Library.
The picture quality of all 4 movies is the best out there you ever can get it, colours are strong with great contrast you can't even compare it with today's new released movies on DVD. They are made in High Definition Masters, with bautifull anmorphic widescreen presentation.

""Icons of Sin-Fic/Historical Adventure""

This movie is shot in black-and-white and runs for 80 minutes. As I mentioned, this is a Hammer Studios film. It was directed by Terrence Fisher and conveys a sort of story about the Thuggees of India, a murderous religious cult.

Guy Rolfe plays Captain Harry Lewis, a seasoned British officer who trys to persuade the East India Company to investigate a situation where people have disappeared -- he is ignored. Lewis is replaced by an incompetent for all his troubles so he investigates the matter on his own. George Pastell plays the role of the High Priest of Kali.

The big picture is that this is yet another story of British mis-management of one of its colonies, in this case, India.

3391916,5,B0016KCCCC,"Okay, perhaps I am exaggerating, but Sangster is a marvelously inventive and imaginative screenplay writer.  If not all his history or horror is real, it's also never dull.

Three of the films in this set were written by Sangster, and they're on a creative par with the rest of his work. Stories come to the point right away, have plenty of action, and conversations are literate but brief.

My favorite of these four films is Terror of the Tongs.  The story of one man attempting to penetrate a large and well-organized conspiracy of terrorists may not seem too likely, but this film is so well made that any disbelief gets suspended right away. The story is very tight and moves quickly.  Sure, nobody who plays Chinese is actually Chinese, but I don't think any offense was meant. It would be well to remember that this was made in an era when actors like Victor Mature played Native Americans.  (It would be years before the industry began to make smarter  casting choices such as Robert Redford as Denys Finch Hatton in Out of Africa.)

The two swashbucklers, Pirates of Blood River and Devil-Ship Pirates, are both highly enjoyable.  There are a few scenes from Blood River that, in composition and color, resemble some of the outstanding N.C. Wyeth or Howard Pyle pirate paintings.  Both films have a great look about them, and a major reason is the presence of Christopher Lee. Whether the part calls for elegant or basic costume, with eye patch or without, Christopher Lee is what pirate captains are supposed to look like.

The Stranglers of Bombay is indeed similar to the Pierce Brosnan film The Deceivers, as the other reviewer mentioned.  I do not claim to know anything of terrorist methods other than what I've seen on the news, but if my understanding is correct in even a limited way, then Stranglers of Bombay shows that terrorist tactics of the 19th century have some overlapping with those of the 21st century.  This is another depiction, like Terror of the Tongs, of how one man tries to uncover the secrets of an organization which has thrived on murder, fear, and silence.  For one man to penetrate such a conspiracy may not be quite believable but writer David Z. Goodman (whose writing here is as good as Sangster's) makes a strong case that it could have happened. Of course, budget and dramatic considerations enter into this, but again, it's terrific work by all concerned.

Three films have great color and Stranglers has glorious black and white.
All have excellent picture detail.  Also, there are numerous extras. Chapter 1 of the serial Great Adventures of Captain Kidd is a don't miss.
