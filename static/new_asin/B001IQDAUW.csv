8311305,5,B001IQDAUW,"use of a narrative device that uses two different sets of actors to play the same characters, one set for ""reality"", and one set for a sort of ""idealized re-enactment.""  All of this is being told in the past tense on an odd talk show. My only gripe is that the meeting between the two romantic leads is filmed twice in two entirely different places, breaking the pattern.  The theme is a man following his impulses too often for his material desires, but following his impulses too seldom for his desire for love.  It makes much more sense the 2nd viewing.",1343952000,,556,4.485148514851486
