8299620,5,B001EW9U5O,"This mesmerizing film made at great risk by a master filmmaker is a journey into the haunted pasts of a doctor and two mental patients whose lives intersect when the hospital is bombed by US troops in 2003. The past lives of the two patients prove them to have been healthy, happy individuals whose illnesses are a result of being unable to bear the cruel twists of fate dealt them by Saddam's regime. Ahlaam, the title, means Dreams in Arabic, and is also the title of the main character,  a young woman whose husband to be is dragged away by police during their wedding and never seen again. While the bombing of the mental hospital allows the patients to escape its cruel, filthy confines, their run-ins with newly arrived US troops do nothing to alleviate their tragic lives.
While harrowing, the film is also beautifully crafted and compelling.",1230595200,2,849,4.736486486486487
