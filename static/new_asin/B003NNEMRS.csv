This time a man who left behind a shameful past suddenly reconncets himslef with these phantoms who intend blackmail him.

High caliber suspense that will be maintained until the last shot of the film. Robert Ryan demonstrates once more why he was one of the main icons of this genre.

Fine direction of Robert Steveneson. Don't miss it.",1322352000,5,499,4.659090909090909
4160605,5,B003NNEMRS,"The cinematography and acting a very good, with Robert Ryan, John Agar, and Laraine Day turning believable performances. Brad Collins (Robert Ryan), former stevedore, is rising fast in a shipping company when local communist agitators use his former Party affiliation to extort his help in stirring up trouble. When Brad resists, communist femme fatale Christine works through his brother-in-law Don. But Brad's new wife Nan sees that her husband and brother are under pressure; when she investigates on her own, party boss Vanning takes ruthless action.

This is an accurate portal of the communist party in the 1940s and 1950s as articulated in Whitaker Chamber's book Witness. McCarthyism is a myth, as Senator Joseph McCarthy couldn't have served on the House Committee for Un-american Activities - because he wasn't a member of the house.

Three books every American should read are: Witness by Whitaker Chambers, Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America's Enemies by M. Stanton Evans, and Totalitarianism: How the Socialist Faith is Destroying America.",1319500800,,1112,5.385057471264368
4160606,5,B003NNEMRS,"Do not be dissuaded by left wing film critics who brush this film off with comments like ""cornball acting"", and ""cartoon characters"", and ""fatuous script"". Indeed, had other noir spy films of the era, which these critics seem to find no fault with, been made implementing the original story of commie villains instead of altering them to nazi villains, some glorified films would have suffered from obscurity as this one has. The acting in this film is as good as any of the top rated noir films I have seen. My wife and I love 1940`s film noir and own nearly all of the noir DVD`s available. I knew of this film but had heard that it was unavailable (Gee, I wonder why) until I decided to check on it at Amazon. The noir style camerawork is as good as any noir film i`ve seen and as far as the story goe`s, while it may not be as great as Double Indemnity, Laura, or Out of the Past, I feel it is at least on equal par to sutch films as Born to Kill, Crossfire, or I Wake Up Screaming. In other words It`s a damn good film noir that deserves at least a three star rating. It`s only fault as far as I`m concerned is that it was too short. But to left wing critics it dared to touch on a taboo subject, and for that it`s been damned and shunned for the past sixty years. The film moves along fairly quickly and  peeks your interest throughout. Robert Ryan stars as a former commie who pulls his head out of his, well, emerges from the dark side let`s say, and is now vice president of a shipping company in San Francisco. In other words he`s an ""evil capitalist pig"". He soon is being blackmailed by the leader of a local ""group"" of communists who threaten to reveal his past to his employer and new spouse, played by Loraine Day. Thomas Gomez is so convincing as the lead commie you will want to reach into your television, pull him through and strangle him to death. For all you film noir lovers out there this film is worth the money and a definate bonus to your noir library.",1283731200,20,1978,4.246684350132626
4160607,4,B003NNEMRS,"This is a beautiful black and white movie filmed by renowned cameraman Nicholas Musuraca. It tells the story of a man with secret (earlier membership of the American Communist Party) and the way he deals with it. The communists are depicted as a secret society consisting of arrogant, affluent intellectuals (and a few hired thugs), an organization without a head. Everybody seems to be scared, even the section leader - an interesting performance by Thomas Gomez who played a victim of capitalism in the purportedly pro communist movie Force of Evil by Abraham Polonsky. The main character is ordered to use his position in the shipping industry to ignite unrest and dissatisfaction among the workers - seemd pretty believeable to me as a course militant policital action might take. The behavior of the main character, Robert Ryan, is somewhat mysterious as he keeps his past affiliation a secret instead of trusting his faithful wife. All in all I found this an inspiring movie with good performances (William Talman is also great and scary as the contract killer) and a stunningly beautiful woman I did not know before: Janis Carter.",1280188800,10,1137,5.021164021164021
4160608,3,B003NNEMRS,"Hollywood propaganda.  Made in 1949, before the McCarthy hearings but probably adding fuel to the fire, we have communists drowning, driving over, and defenestrating those who don't go along with their nefarious plots to create labor strife on the San Francisco docks.  Robert Ryan is suitably cool and Thomas Gomez is predictably evil.  However, whether Laraine Day or Janis Carter in the ""Woman"" of the title we'll never know, since neither of them ever gets to Pier 13, which isn't in the movie anyway.",1276560000,2,505,4.988095238095238

8401282,2,B003NNEMRS,"What's truly  ironic about this movie is the longtime movie tough guy Robert Ryan was an outspoken opponent of McCarthyism and the ""Red Scare."" He was part of the Hollywood group organized by Bogart and Bacall that went to Washington, D.C. to protest the hearings on Commie infiltration into Hollywood and risked being blacklisted except his status as a much decorated Marine  Corps drill instructor would have made public that the the hearings were a shameless sham to smear good Americans. He did make many excellent movies although this is not one of them.",1409184000,,559,4.9361702127659575
8401283,5,B003NNEMRS,"This was originally titled, 'I married a Communist', and my history teacher mentioned it one day, claiming, ""I've looked everywhere for this and I can never find it."" I don't understand how people can say that. Does 'everywhere' not include Amazon.com? Because I just typed it in and I found exactly what he wanted. Anyways, he was very excited when I gifted it to him, his face was priceless. :)",1403049600,,396,4.671428571428572
8401284,4,B003NNEMRS,"This is a great little movie, with an interesting side to it.  It was made at a time of early cold war spies, undercover operators, and American communists.  It is very much a late 1940's film, with great black and white photography, good acting and a relevant plot line.  It seems kind of dated to us, but the underlying outlook on reality, the ""commies"" of the day, are very much still with us.  I hesitated to give a 5, because I like to save this for the very top.  But a 4 seemed a little weak.",1402617600,4,499,4.15625
8401285,3,B003NNEMRS,It's difficult to like a film when the lead characters make stupid decisions.  Not Robert Ryan's best.  It picks up in excitment the second half then falls with a thud.,1384905600,,168,4.566666666666666
8401286,4,B003NNEMRS,"I studied film in a university setting and have kept my interest through the years.  This is a small film in terms of films overall.  But it is also an important artifact insofar as it reveals how people thought and depicted in film the underground, communist movement.  Gone are the days, but not the movie.",1370131200,,308,4.5636363636363635
