7836398,3,6303059910,"Silent Witness:Shroud of Turin is a fairly well-made and interesting introduction to the Shroud of Turin, to its purported history, to its photographic mysteries and to the modern characters involved. It includes a recreation of Secondo Pia's 1898 photographing of the Shroud and the 1532 fire that damaged it. The film also includes short, seemingly staged interviews with author Ian Wilson, scientists John Jackson and Eric Jumper, botanist Dr. Max Frei and others. The film relies rather heavily on Frie's analysis of pollen taken from the Shroud which led him to conclude that the Shroud had been in Europe, Turkey and Palestine. LA Coroner Dr. Robert Bucklin analyzed life-size blowups of the Shroud to demonstrate the anatomical correctness of the wounds.

The film does perpetuate a few canards about the Shroud, mainly that disproven notion about the nail wound necessarily appearing in the wrists and damaging the median nerves. Also, a Vatican priest's indication that the Shroud shows 100+ lashes is an exaggeration. Since the scourge had three thongs, there were only 30 or so separate strokes -- nothing I'd like to experience, but a little less sensational.

All in all, a light but not bad introduction to the Shroud, its photographic peculiarities and the controversies that swirl around it.",1146787200,,1307,5.219047619047619
7836399,5,6303059910,The Silent Witness is a compelling documentary.  This film details the historical and scientific data supporting the research on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin.  This video is a must see for those who believe in  the resurrection of Christ as well as those who doubt it.  I base the 5  stars on the bases of content.  It is a logical and illuminating series of  fact however it is a documentary with the visual panache of a low budget  film.,955584000,4,450,4.469135802469136
