Part 1 (lessons 1-12 landscape photography):
Presentation was methodical and lessons covered the technical, practical and artistic aspects of photography. Michael Melford emphasized keeping things simple, and explained the concepts of lighting, composition and moment with practical examples. Using a simple oak tree from his backyard he was able to illustrate and drive home a number of good points.

Exposure and depth-of-field control by manipulating f-stop, shutter speed and ISO were well covered, but white balance and neutral-grey metering were left out. Post-processing with Adobe Lightroom was briefly demonstrated. Overall, a decent set of 12 lessons.

Part 2 (lessons 13-24 wildlife photography):
Simplicity emphasized in Part 1 took an about face and turned into complexity in Part 2. The case studies in the second group of lessons while fun to watch as a documentary, failed to achieve its objective as a photography course. Somehow theres a disconnect between Part 1 and Part 2, perhaps due to a lack of continuity along the same theme of lighting, composition and moment. The examples drawn from Tim Lamans on-location NatGeo assignments were simply not practical nor applicable to the average photographer enthusiast, i.e. the target audience of this course.

Theres no question that Tim Laman is a passionate and an accomplished photographer. But sometimes a skilled practitioner may not necessarily make an effective teacher. A good instructor can relate to his target audience, and teaches whats realistic and doable at the student's level. Most of the Part 2 lessons seem to focus on the exotic subjects and locations rather than techniques of photography. There's really no point in discussing 10 species of monkeys and 39 species of birds of paradise when the student cant possibly go out and emulate the complex setups and rigs necessary for such shoots. Also, whats the relevance of showing a time-lapse of photographic equipment and gizmos all laid out covering every inch on a hotel bed? The photographic paraphernalia shown throughout the lessons isn't something the average student can afford to own nor aspire to tote around in his/her travels.

For the reasons above, lessons from Part 2 offer little practical value. Unless Part 2 gets an overhaul, or removed (perhaps repackaged as a standalone documentary), I cant recommend the bundle as a photography course as a whole.

P. S. while close captioning is a necessity in any training video, I couldn't find a way to turn it off in the video.",1512864000,,2619,5.209026128266033

7800607,4,1629973238,"The two sections of this course are approached very differently. The landscape lectures, by Michael Melford, are extremely educational, comprehensive, useful and enlightening.  I've always admired landscape photography, and with the course I have a better understanding of it and feel like I could give it a try.  I really bought this course, however, for the wildlife course, as I'm an avid amateur wildlife photographer.  These lectures would be better named ""Twelve Documentary Lectures on Extreme Wildlife Photography.""  Don't get me wrong, watching Laman discuss his adventures is fascinating,  But I'm never going to hire porters to carry my equipment, or build hides 50 feet up a tree in Borneo, or push my gear crawling through the mud, or get to meet researchers who will share their subjects with me.  I'm going to take a couple lenses to my local wildlife refuge or park, hoping the bird I've heard about, or anything, will show up, and I'll get a chance to photograph it without something going wrong like missing the moment or the light going bad,  With the wildlife lectures, I had to constantly ask myself, ""Ok, how does this translate to real life?""  And I coudn't always answer it.  A full lecture on techniques used in flight photography would have been amazing, for example.  Oh well, I'll keep looking,  I'll rewatch to see if there is anything else I can glean from it, but was generally disappointed.",1481673600,6,1422,4.932773109243698
