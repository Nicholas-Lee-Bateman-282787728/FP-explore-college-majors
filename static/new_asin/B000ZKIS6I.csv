8235765,1,B000ZKIS6I,"There is no connection between Zen Buddhism and shiatsu, other than the fact that both originated in the Orient.  Whenever I see a title that has the word ""zen"" in it, and it has nothing to do with zen, I refuse to even look at it.  It's just bald marketing for spiritual suckers.",1404086400,,280,4.264150943396227
8235766,1,B000ZKIS6I,"I expected this DVD must be really good due to its cost $68.88 for 1 DVD. It turned out it just plain. It's not very bad, but I don't think I learned much from it. The contents are very basic and not in depth. The instructor and the client both wear black pants. It's hard to see the instructor's movements. What's more, when I was purchasing it from amazon.com, it showed the price was DVD: $68.88, shipping&handling: 7.98. Then a few weeks later, I found my credit card was charged 90.77 for this item. Definitely I don't recommend this seller.",1363824000,,546,4.47
8235767,4,B000ZKIS6I,"When I checked out with my credit card, it was $68 for one DVD The Art of Zen Shiatsu. Afterwards I found the charge was around $91 from my credit card account. Definitely if I had known I had to spend $91 for one DVD, I would have not purchased it. The hidden charge was disturbing.",1345680000,,283,4.071428571428571
8235768,4,B000ZKIS6I,"As massage student, I certainly learned quite some new technique from this DVD. I especially love using
one's knees on the hip and back of legs.

I agree with other reviewers that their pants are long and dark, hard to see. It would be better if the
recipient of the massage wears short gym clothes.",1334707200,,299,4.4363636363636365
8235769,4,B000ZKIS6I,I am a massage instructor and I really enjoyed this DVD.  It is clear and precise. I especially appreciated the stretching exercises given at the beginning.  It is pleasant on the eyes and a well made product.  It is a good teaching aid and a refresher for those who have not practiced the art of shiatsu in while. A workbook to accompany it would be worthwhile.,1306540800,,362,4.454545454545454
8235770,3,B000ZKIS6I,"Good DVD on Shiatsu. The only thing would have been better is if they used a lighter background in the video. Since the subject is wearing dark clothes, it is hard to see exactly what is going on. But overall it is a nice video.",1287705600,,228,4.088888888888889
8235771,5,B000ZKIS6I,"This DVD is very professional and very easy to follow.
The music and background are beautiful and give me peace of mind.
As a massage therapy student, it was very helpful to learn shiatsu.
I believe this DVD is good for both beginners and professionals.
This is the best DVD/video for massage therapy for me so far.
I recommend this DVD for people who want to learn shiatsu.",1261699200,,374,4.514705882352941
8235772,5,B000ZKIS6I,"As students of massage therapy, we are contantly in search of clear presentation.  Zen Shiatsu has really become the gold standard for me. This video is so professioanal, so clear, and really captures the simple beauty of Shiatsu massage while at the same time gently introducing the various subtle and more complex points for the advancing practitioner. The video and sound quality, the music and the background, and the instructors voice and instruction really make this the essential DVD for my professioanl library.  It's a good reference, it's soothing just to watch, and it's perfect for the student.",1254960000,,606,5.173469387755102
8235773,5,B000ZKIS6I,"This is an extremely well done presentation on shiatsu. I am a licensed acupuncturist and use these techniques on a table that I lower a little bit more than when doing acupuncture(although I tend to mix them together using both acupuncture and shiatsu). At least 90% of the material here will work on the table. I also transcribed the entire DVD as a way to get it into my brain a little more. In sum, this presentation has transformed my acupuncture work in a very positive way .",1212796800,,481,4.4772727272727275
