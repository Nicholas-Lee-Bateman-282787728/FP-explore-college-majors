8756857,5,B01DT01IM6,"Five entertaining and informative videos, no pseudoscience here.  The video on Tutankhamen was about 90 minutes and dragged a bit--is it really so important how he died?  A lot of time is devoted to examining mummies with MRI.  The best video I had seen on the NGC channel, about the building of the Great Pyramid of Khufu/Cheops at Giza.  Totally fascinating new theory of how they did it, which I found thoroughly convincing, and the story of the researcher who proposed it is a great human interest story.  The other videos are all quite good; not a bummer in the five.  Some of the episodes are about 45 minutes long.  There are a few extras, all pretty useless.",1518652800,,666,4.593220338983051
8756858,4,B01DT01IM6,"Informative and professionally produced.  My only issue is that the investigations strictly follow the 'modern scientific methods', and the cultural / religious / mystical roots have been more or less left out.  I like documentaries which are comprehensive in their interpretive methods.  Would still recommend this CD set.",1517616000,,323,5.6875
8756859,5,B01DT01IM6,"Set came quickly and was packaged well. Price was great! You can't be the price for what you get! We used them for a homeschool unit on Ancient Egypt and while my daughter initially did not want to watch them, she was very quickly engrossed.",1487980800,2,241,4.377777777777778
