5667056,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Having just been to Ireland, I loved the very Irish wit of this clever spoof on the monster movie genre!!",1375142400,2,105,4.3
5667057,4,B00BQRBGYA,"From experience, for lesser known films, I am skeptical of their initial Amazon reviews (especially reviews that are light on description and heavy on raves). Such glowing reviews seem like marketing fluff or good vibes from folks related to production/cast members. So, with three 5-star reviews, I was dubious here, but willing to purchase the lottery ticket. I'm a Sci-fi fan and I appreciate the comedic horror/dark sci-fi genre... think Kevin Bacon in ""Tremors"" or Bruce Campbell in the ""Army of Darkness.""

Well, I have to admit, ""Grabbers"" delivered. The mix of charming local Irish flavor, alien squid-like monsters, and drinking until you're drunk (as creature kryptonite)... it all worked! The CGI effects were decent for the cost, there was character development, a consistent story, and a bit of romance to make this a decent choice for a couples night - assuming that you both go for ""campy"" Sci-fi monster flicks. For me, it barely crossed into the ""horror"" category and the gore was limited. There were a few gasp moments for those seeking thrills, but the quirky humor kept the ""scare"" factor in check.

Parental Advisory: There are ""F"" bombs/curses all over the place (Irish accent notwithstanding), and suggestive lines but no nudity. The gore includes a severed head or two - you would think that's horrific, but under the circumstances, it wasn't. The portrayed stereotype of the Irish loving their alcohol could possibly be offensive to some people (if you view this as serious drama), but that does an injustice to the intent of this funny British entertainment piece.

Overall... while on my personal Indie scale I can't get to a 5-star rating... for what it is, I rank it a solid 4 star. I'd be willing to spring for the sequel if they go that route. Don't ask too many questions and simply enjoy the ride.",1375056000,,1830,4.915857605177994

5667059,5,B00BQRBGYA,"This movie is an overall good time.  It is a fun sci-fi flick so don't expect something to think about and analyze.  It uses a lot of the same basic storyline that has been done before; however, it still manages to keep it fresh and entertaining.  If you like sci-fi and british comedy, then this is a must.  One of my favorite things is when the action picks up so does the comedy, similar to Shaun of the Dead.  There is a nice mix of tension and comedic relief to keep you wondering if you should be laughing or fearing for the characters.  If you are someone who easily jumps at horror movies, you might even get a little fright from a few moments.",1374278400,5,652,4.217741935483871

5667069,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Loved this!  I originally saw it on tv (i've watched it several times ) and i wanted it for my  permanent  video  library, it takes place at the current  time in a small costal town in Ireland.  It involves a policemen who likes to drink (most of the town does) , a replacement officer from a larger town (she does not  drink)  and some  extra terrestrial life form that drops into the sea. What ensues is a charming and  funny tale  with a monster that threatens the town .

5667070,4,B00BQRBGYA,"As a science fiction movie, even at the B-movie level, this film is a complete failure. There is very little science, or fiction, other than ""it came from space, has tentacles, and eats (sober) people."" What completely redeems this is the fact that ""Grabbers"" is funny as heck thanks to the two leads and their supporting cast.",1497916800,,327,4.754385964912281

5667080,5,B00BQRBGYA,"This is an absolutely side-splittingly hilarious movie that, despite not being a ""first-run"" kind of movie, was WAY better than you'd expect it to be from the title and description alone. I watched it once when Amazon Prime was showing it for free, and then decided when I had guests at the house that we all needed to watch it again - so I gladly paid the purchase price to own this movie. Is it absurd? Yup. Is it over the top? Sure. Is it funny and somehow endearing? 100% so. I'm sure I'll laugh through this several more times.",1481587200,,532,4.33

Editing seems a little choppy, but if you can get past that you will find that the cast provide great performances and the effects are pretty solid.

5667090,4,B00BQRBGYA,"This a nice fun contribution to the alien creatures attack a small town genre.  Reminds me a lot of Critters and other movies like this that were my staple viewing as a little kid in the 80's.  This one's creatures resemble squids when fully grown with mouths like the pit thing had that Jabba tried to dump Luke, Han and the others into in Return of the Jedi. They love human blood but always spit out the head. When these creatures are hatchlings they ooze the awwwwww aren't they cute factor, until they attach themselves to your face!  It's a movie that isn't trying to be plausible and isn't taking itself seriously at all.  The way the local island inhabitants learn to protect themselves from these creatures is pretty unique and appropriate to the culture of Ireland. It's just a movie trying to have fun.  Granted it is a little slow in parts, especially the beginning but even that is somewhat entertaining by the interaction between the new temporary Garda (police officer) played by Ruth Bradley (Humans) who takes her job seriously and goes by the book, and the permanent police officer, Richard Coyle, who sees his job as an excuse to get drunk and just take things as they go.

The aliens look pretty good for a non massive budget movie.  Things like the spat out heads at times look fake but really you're watching this kind of movie for the fun of it, so that sort of thing doesn't hamper your enjoyment to any significant extent.",1471219200,,1447,4.5852713178294575
5667091,5,B00BQRBGYA,"This is one of my favorite movies! I watched it three times on Netflix while it was still available, then rented it on Amazon Prime and watched it three times in 48 hours. I decided to buy a DVD so I could watch it when the mood strikes.

5667094,5,B00BQRBGYA,"I found this movie at our public library and kept checking it out. I figured I needed to have my own copy at that point. If you enjoy the movie, Tremors, you will really enjoy this, Set on an island off the coast of Ireland and produced by the Irish Film Board, the setting is authentic as it was filmed in Ireland. It is scary and at times, hilarious. The characters are very likable, the special effects are credible, and the ending is very satisfactory.

5667097,3,B00BQRBGYA,"Although I liked it these horror/comedies tend to be a bit too much comedy than horror for my liking.

 The creatures (or going by their scientific name, Grabbers) are very well done for a low budget movie and the setting a pub in the Irish countryside is quite picturesque. It was nice seeing Bronagh Gallagher of The Commitments fame again and Paddy was quite the character.

 But Ruth Bradley is the star of the show and when she gets drunk the cuteness factor gets turned up to eleven. She's good too in the TV show 'Humans' a sub-par remake of the brilliant Swedish sci-fi drama 'Real Humans'.

 Grabbers is an enjoyable enough movie with some fantastic creatures but just a bit too silly for my tastes.",1463702400,,708,4.579365079365079

5667102,5,B00BQRBGYA,"The first two reviews in this block are largely spot on. I hesitated to give the film five stars, but that was only in deference to it's situation as a lowly genre film. For what it is, a formula-faithful creature feature, I can't think when I've seen a better one. GRABBERS is beautifully shot and edited, with a much better script than it needs; the acting is uniformly goodand here and there, superb; the laughs are numerous, well-earned, and plot- and-character based; and the monsters are excellent (much better in design and execution, I thought, than the tentacled whatsis in the latest star wars film (not to take anything away from the perhaps intentional cheesiness of that beastie).

They could survive on land, as long as the stayed wet.  A major storm was forecast soon, which would allow the Grabbers to feed off the entire town.

Those who investigated the attacks found the Grabbers weakness.  One victim had survived - the town drunk.  He'd been so drunk, his blood alcohol level had been fatal to the Grabber.

5667120,4,B00BQRBGYA,"WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS!!!  This Nothern Ireland-lensed horror comedy (filmed partly in the same area as the revived Hammer Films' WAKE WOOD - 2011) has a really ridiculous premise, but the goofy overall tone of the talented cast will win you over very quickly (and, for once, their accents don't need subtitles to understand what they are saying). The film opens with what looks like a meteor hitting the waters just off the coast of Erin Island (a town known more for their drinking than their fishing), when the crew of a fishing trawler notice it and send out an SOS to the Coast Guard. Everyone on the trawler is then disposed of by a huge creature with tentacles. This just happens to be the first day of policewoman (here called 'Gardas"") Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley), who is on a two-week temporary assignment on Erin Island to replace another Garda who is on holiday. She is picked up from the ferry by fellow Garda Ciaran O'Shea (Richard Coyle), who is nursing the mother of bad hangovers and doesn't want a stranger as a temporary partner.
Their first case as an investigating team is the beaching and deaths of a group of Pilot whales. Island coroner Dr. Adam Smith (Russell Tovey), who takes one look at Lisa and is instantly smitten, tells them that this phenomenon is known to have happened before, but scientists have no explanation as to why it happens. Eternally drunk fisherman Paddy (a hilarious Lalor Roddy) catches a baby tentacled creature in one of his lobster traps and puts it in his bathtub (after it squirts something in the face of another fisherman), while other people are being pulled off the beach into the ocean by large tentacles. A married couple relaxing in a house near the beach (the husband is watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD [1968] on his TV) get a knock on their front door and when the husband opens it, he notices one of his friends (who he thinks is drunk) is moving weirdly. He is actually being used as a marionette by a giant creature as bait (or a worm as it were, pulling a reversal on fisherman) and when the husband goes outside to investigate, a tentacle pulls him up straight in the air, his wife screaming in terror. She tries to hide in the house, but a tentacle comes down the chimney and pulls her through the fireplace.
When Paddy is attacked by the small creature he found (it tries to wrap itself around his face, a tribute to ALIEN [1979] and there are all types of references to other horror and science fiction films in this movie), but he manages to pull it off him without being harmed. He brings the baby creature to Alan's lab for an autopsy (Paddy thinks it is dead and calls it a ""grabber"", a reference to TREMORS [1989]), but Alan discovers that the small creature is pregnant (he pulls out a disgusting round egg from its body) and tells Ciaran, Lisa and Paddy that all the creature needs to survive is water (shades of GREMLINS [1984]) and blood, so he sets fire to it and Lisa accidentally sets off the sprinkler system (Alan sarcastically says, ""You are Irish, aren't you?""), reviving the creature and it attaches itself to Ciaran's face (it's funny and horrifying at the same time, as Ciaran hits himself in the face with a shovel to get the creature off him), but the creature suddenly lets go and falls to the floor. Adam comes to the conclusion that the creatures are allergic to alcohol (Paddy is drunk and Ciaran still has alcohol in his body from last night), but they must find out how much alcohol in their system it will take to kill the creatures (since all Paddy and Ciaran did was temporarily incapacitate the small creature), so they use Lisa as a test subject (she has never drank alcohol before) and get her drunk as a skunk (it's a really funny scene) and then inject a vial of her alcohol-infused blood into the small captive creature, killing it. Adam reads her blood alcohol level as 0.20, so they will have do get everyone on the island that drunk (there seems to be a lack of children on the island, so that isn't a stumbling block in this film), but not tell them the truth so there isn't a panic.
They come up with the bright idea to throw a party at the island's bar owned by husband and wife Brian (David Pearse) and Una Mahar (Bronaugh Gallagher; who is as funny here as she was in BOTCHED - 2007), who are both aware of the situation, with a ""free bar"", so nearly everyone on the island shows up (hey, free booze is free booze!) for the free drinks (mixed with Paddy's super-potent homemade brew). It begins raining outside (not a good thing) as tiny tentacled creatures approach the bar (it a hoot the way they move) and Brian and Una try to get everyone to a 0.20 alcohol blood level while a drunk Ciaran and Lisa are keeping an eye out in their patrol car outside and begin to fall in love (it's a highly inappropriate time and a drunk Lisa mentions that very same fact, but the drunken heart wants what the drunken heart wants). They spot the tiny creatures approaching the bar and start squishing them beneath their feet, but they then notice one of the bar patrons has stepped outside to take a leak and it is grabbed by the mother of all tentacled creatures, spitting out the poor guy's head out till it rolls at Ciaran and Lisa's feet. When the bar runs out of alcohol is when the trouble really begins, but I won't spoil it for you, other than to say that drunk people are rather useless in life-or-death situations (Brian runs outside in the rain with a Super Soaker full of Paddy's extremely flammable alcohol with a lit candle taped beneath the water gun's spout, he being too drink to understand that as soon as he walks outside, the candle will be extinguished by the rain) and Lisa going into full-blown Sigourney Weaver mode (copying one of her actions in ALIENS - 1986). In the immortal words of Brian the next morning. ""That was fun, wasn't it?"" It sure was and a final coda at the end leaves the film wide-open for a sequel, one I wouldn't mind watching.
Director Jon Wright (TORMENTED - 2009; ROBOT OVERLORDS - 2014), working with a screenplay by first-time feature-length writer Kevin Lehane, keeps the tone light and funny, even in the gore scenes, such as when Ciaran and Lisa go to the house that was attacked and a human head rolls off the roof and hits Ciaran squarely on the nose. For once, the CGI is not a distraction and works very well here, as the giant creature destroys a car and its tentacles impale people through their torsos or just lift them up in the air. The CGI-filled sequence of the baby creatures approaching the bar will have you howling with delight, not because the CGI is bad, but because it is so good you will not notice it is CGI at all (That is what CGI should be: invisible). Screenwriter Lehane fills the film with references to other films (there's a direct sequence related to PREDATOR [1987] towards the end of the film) and some extremely funny dialogue, such as when the bar runs out of alcohol and the drunk group discusses that they may have to sacrifice one of their own in order for the others to get away and Brian says, ""Let them eat Father Potts (Michel O'Gruagain). That should keep them busy for a while!"" (the look on the portly Father's face is priceless) or a s**t-faced Paddy telling another patron when he discovers that they are out of booze, ""Relax, you'll give yourself angina!"" Don't raise your expectations too high and you'll have a lot of fun with this film. Also starring Pascal Scott, Clelia Murphy, Louis Dempsey, Ned Dennehy, Stuart Graham and Jonathan Ryan.

special effects and creepy as well as amusing in some parts.  I put this film in the ""TREMORS"" class of films.  There is this meteor thing that  crashes outside a small Irish fishing town and then every thing breaks loose.  There is this mother monster (about 4 feet across) that can lay bowling
ball size eggs that are bigger than her body, and there is the Father that is huge and gobbles up people but spits out there heads. And then, there
are these cute little babies that cause panic in the little town.  There is a drunk hero and a cute chickeeboo  and admire and some very fine CGI
effects as well and good background music too boot.  Like BATTLESHIP this one never explains why these aliens came (to eat I guess) but it is
a very campy movie I think and should be liked by most monster-alien afficiadoes I think.  Anyhow, I give it 4 stars, I would give it 4 1/2 stars if

5667129,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Grabbers is a modern creature-feature, horror-comedy from the Emerald shores of Ireland. The film is directed by Jon Wright, who directed the 2009 dark horror, social satire Torment, which dealt with class warfare and social injustice within society through the microcosm of the politics of life among the student body. That film was a serious address to the principles of an action-consequence scenario set in a traditional-styled horror. Grabbers is a lighter, more fun-loving satire about Irish stereotypes, inebriation, and a celebration of community and culture facing an identity in transition,set in total b-movie sci-fi, horrror-comedy fanfare.

For me personally, Grabbers is one of those rare films that celebrates everything about classic b-movie creature-features in a modern way without looking like it is making a big effort to do so. It gets it right! The film flows smoothly and effortlessly, which makes it an easy, fun viewing experience. There is no real odd moments were the acting seems coerced, or the lines fall flat. You don't even have to be Irish, or from the UK, to get the humor to relate to the film. Grabbers maintains a level of story and dialog that is truly universal. Not since Killer Klowns From Outer Space and Tremors have I enjoyed a film like this so much. The creatures dominated every scene they were in, with care and quality taken to how best to represent the monsters on screen. They didn't look cartoonish or ridiculous. The actors were funny and likable. The funny was actually funny. I have to say that Grabbers is a really great film, and one of the best horror-comedies that I have seen in a great while.",1432598400,,1653,4.946043165467626

Grabbers would fit remarkably well within the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.  Though it has most in common with Shaun of the Dead atmospherically, Grabbers is a fair amalgamation of each in both horror and humor, pulling themes of Shaun's Winchester Pub, Hot Fuzz's police and investigative elements, and The World's End's alien threat.  I don't mean to suggest there's any aping afoot on Grabbers' part, only fans of Pegg/Frost/Wright will feel more than comfortable for the two or so hours they spend with the townsfolk of the fake Irish island of Erin.

As with all good otherworldly threats, Grabbers opens with what appears to be a meteor crashing into the sea.  Shortly after: chaos, islanders disappearing by inexplicable means in an otherwise quiet hamlet.  Strong pacing keeps the audience engaged during the slower beginning through use of tiny reveals with the alien's design and nature.  I hesitate to spoil that journey so I'm being vague, but it's not a terrible secret if you're paying any bit of attention.  I'd gone in blind, knowing what I was likely getting into only through assumptions, and it made for a better experience than I think I'd have otherwise gotten with those bits known too early.  Special effects for the creatures are good.  At some points they appear rubbery which only added to the film's camp, but this is reserved more for the smaller aliens - spawn, I guess - and not the larger adults.

Acting is fine.  The only actor I knew was Richard Coyle, and him from the awful Prince of Persia.  He's considerably better here.  There's a moment when Ruth Bradley's character has a Ripley moment with a nice take on the ""Get away from her you bitch!"" line, Irishfied (not a word) for better punch.  In this way the writing is good.  Though I'm sure it's not, much of the dialogue had an ad-lib feel with actors/characters playing well off of one another to a point of easy familiarity.  I settled into the town right away.

Grabbers stands well with other horror comedies.  Again, you're looking at more Shaun than Dale and Tucker, Grabbers even hedging close to late 80s/early 90s in its presentation, a trait immediately prone to winning me over.  I don't know if I'd go back to Grabbers any time soon, though I wouldn't be upset if it was the only thing available to watch either.

The premise, and most of the film, is taken up by the lame concept of ""if we all just get really drunk, the alien monsters wonted eat us"". And it's an awkward, grandma and grandpa getting drunk with all the townspeople. The monsters look cool, the acting isn't bad, but the most dramatic scene is the cover of the DVD, and even that is not in the film. Too much lame drunk humor, a really weak budding romance, and not enough originality to make this film descent.

5667143,4,B00BQRBGYA,"I liked a lot this Irish-British tongue-in-cheek parody of SF/monster movies. It is not a masterpiece, but a well done, funny, highly entertaining film. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

This film PRETENDS to be a serious SF/monster movie, so the opening scenes and premises follow strictly the rules of the genre. On a dark night (it is always a dark night) cruel invaders from outer space arrive on a meteorite (it is always a meteorite). They land in the sea in the middle of a storm (when sea is involved, it always begins in the middle of a storm), near a small isolated community (it is always a small isolated community), residing on a small coastal island (as everybody knows it is probably the best place to begin an extra-terrestrial infestation). They want to grab and eat people (of course they do) and also to spawn and multiply (I can understand that - spawning and multiplying is fun...). But they also have a special weakness (they always have one...).

On their way will stand a lonely sheriff (they are always lonely - even if they have partners)... well, OK, in fact an An Garda Siochana agent named Ciaran O'Shea (Richard Coyle). This hero is a rather likeable guy, although definitely not the most elite element wearing the uniform and of course he has some issues (they always have issues). Just before the beginning of the invasion he is (of course) paired with a brand new partner, who is completely different from him (they always are) and in the beginning they don't get along well (they never do), but it will change (it always does).

This partner is a chick (they frequently are), named Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley). Lisa is a by-the-book kind of cop and a rather strictly-buttoned-up kind of gal - and she also has a kind of little secret which makes her social contacts in Ireland a little bit difficult... She also TOTALLY hates being wolf-whistled...))) She is of course cute even if not exactly a kind of super-model beauty - because if she was one she wouldn't work on a one-dog island but go to Dublin and play in the movies... oh, wait...

All this takes like the first five minutes of the film and of the rest I will not say much - you deserve to discover it by yourself. However it is also fair to say that, with the whole thing happening in Ireland, the consumption of potent potables, Catholicism and Polish immigrants will play some part, very important for the first point and very episodic for the latter two. Also, because this extra-terrestrial invasion occurs exceptionally in Ireland and not in USA, large firearms will NOT appear - instead, Earth will be defended and protected by most unusual but surprisingly efficient (and TOTALLY HILARIOUS) weaponry...)))...)))...)))

I liked this film A LOT and I spend a really nice moment watching it. I laughed a lot and there was a couple of scenes in which I really ROLLED ON THE FLOOR! Alien creatures are very well done, secondary characters are excellent and the settings have a unique kind of charm. I cannot however rate this film five stars, because the two main characters switch roles in the middle of the film and that doesn't work so well. Also, the development of relations between Ciaran and Lisa was not handled well. Richard Coyle does a great job in this film, but he is a guy in his 40s and his character is too old and worn out to be credibly attractive to a young sweet thing like Lisa, who is barely out of her diapers...

That two points notwithstanding, this is a good, funny, highly entertaining and very original film and I am glad that I bought it. ENJOY! Or rather, in this case, SLAINTE!",1421280000,,3621,4.641185647425897

5667155,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Wacky locals versus yucky extraterrestrials is a lot of fun IF you watch it in the right frame of mind. It plays a lot like a modernized re-working of ""ISLAND OF TERROR"" from 1967. That great little ""B"" picture told much the same story: bizarre lifeforms threaten to obliterate a tiny island community off the coast of Ireland (and possibly the world, if they get half a chance), and the island locals band together to stop the menace. The difference here is that instead of radiation the locals use inebriation as a means to stop the beasties. You see, the slithery creatures cannot stand alcohol, so the folks quickly realize that everyone has to get as blitzed as possible in order to ward off the creepy critters, which makes for some tough planning & plotting sessions when everyone that's required to do hard, clear thinking is three sheets to the wind.

The film has its share of shocks & screams but it's all played for fun and I laughed out loud at most of the goings on. Some of the jokes fell kinda flat but for the most part I was all-in for this laugh & scare frightfest, which proudly carries on in the tradition of such similar classics of the genre as ""An American Werewolf in London"" and the ""Tremors"" series of films. ""GRABBERS"" was the work of a small local film company and several talented local types. The visual F/X are decent considering the tiny budget and the relative inexperience of the crew & techs who worked on it. You can tell that it was a work of love and that everyone, both cast & crew, seemed to be having a blast. Actually, the only negative I can think of is that the thick accents of some of the actors might make it tough-going for those not used to British films.

5667173,4,B00BQRBGYA,"Grabbers (Jon Wright, 2012)

There are a couple of dozen ways to get me to watch a movie no matter what else anyone tells me about it. (Earlier tonight I posted on Facebook that the only way it would be possible to get me interested in a movie with the ridiculous title of Witching and Bitching would be to put A Film by &Aacute;lex de la Iglesia underneath the title. Unfortunately....) One of those is casting Richard Coyle as the male lead. I adore Coyle, both in his television work (Strange, Coupling) and his film work (A Good Year, What Rats Won't Do). But you stick Richard Coyle in a movie about invading aliens and rampaging drunkenness? I'm there with brass knobs on. And so I will not pretend for one second that I will be writing an unbiased review of Grabbers, a film I loved with all my stingy little heart, and I am going to rationalize away a lot of criticisms I have read about the movie that, I realize during rare lucid moments, are all quite valid (including those raised by my lovely colleague over at Nekoneko's Movie Litterbox, who coincidentally posted a review of the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;two days after I watched it). But you know what? I don't care. I still loved it with all my stingy little heart.

Wright (Tormented) and screenwriter Kevin Lehane (turning in his first feature) give us the tale of Ciar&aacute;n O'Shea (Coyle), a high-functioning (and I use that term loosely) alcoholic police officer on an island so quiet that most days of the year, he can stay behind his desk drinking. His boss, Sergeant Kenefick (Patriot Games' Jonathan Ryan), is going off to the mainland for some continuing education and, for obvious reasons, he doesn't feel quite confident leaving the island in O'Shea's less-than-capable hands. He requests a stand-in from the mainland, and gets it in the form of Lisa Nolan (Flyboys' Ruth Bradley). She's upbeat. Worse, she's a teetotaler. Still, O'Shea thinks he can get through the two weeks with minimal distraction...until the island is invaded by bloodsucking monsters from space. Eventually (normally I would call this a spoiler, but it happens to be the movie's tagline, so...) the two of them, along with the island's coroner, discover that the only thing that will keep the monsters away is alcohol. Backup is on the way, but the two of them have to keep the islanders alive until it comes...so what better way than to gather everyone in the local pub and have the biggest piss-up the place has ever seen?

So, let's see. Slimy aliens, gallons of booze, and Richard Coyle. What's not to love? Coyle is a much-proven comic actor, and Bradley holds her own against him. There was one subplot that was kind of predictable (though I enjoyed it immensely), and some viewers might be put off by the over-the-top nature of the climactic sequence and a few of its build-up scenes. But then if Wright was going for a parody of every big-budget Hollywood monster movie since Independence Day, even in part, I thought he did a pretty darn good job of sending them up while still keeping his own movie relatively down-to-earth. It feels odd to describe a movie as affable, but when I put the two things up against one another, that's what comes to mind. Other than that, any possible criticisms of the movie that came to mind were minor at best; a few minor characters who could have been better-developed, mostly. In other words, what are you waiting for? If you're looking for a monster movie involving copious amounts of alcohol, you've found it. *** ",1396915200,,3507,4.7254901960784315

It deals with communal peril, an island cutoff from the mainland and the current nesting place of a big many limbed monster from........?  The thing likes blood and removing heads.

Reminiscent of Tremors (even the name of the creatures--grabbers--is similar to ""graboids,"" the epithet given the monsters in Tremors), this film is by turns, tense, hilarious, frightening, and poignant and remarkably free of gore.  The scenery is beautiful. I'd love to see that shoerline in person, minus the ""grabbers"" of course. There's humor throughout, enough to keep it from being wholly horrifying, but it comes from the situations ant the characters themselves and isn't slapstick or artificial. It's an interesting view of life on a small Irish island played around the intrusion of alien creatures built along the lines of HP Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Irish accents may take a bit of intent listening. A few familiar faces, for those who've watched Being Human or Primeval. All in all, I'm glad I found it.",1394755200,,878,5.1328671328671325
5667178,5,B00BQRBGYA,"In this unexpectedly charming movie, a likable alcoholic is challenged with saving an Irish community of fishermen from a blood-sucking alien invasion through reckless inebriation.  Now I understand that this plot may leave you pondering ""just how good could this movie really be?""  Just take my word for it and give this film a chance.  Think Shaun of the Dead.

Our unlikely hero is local drunkard Ciarn O'Shea (Richard Coyle; BBC's Coupling) and, of course, he of all people makes the discovery that the tentacular aliens are allergic (even deadly so) to the local lushes' high blood-alcohol content.  Nice choice to begin your invasion, aliens.  You're deathly allergic to alcohol and you crash-landed off the coast of Ireland.  Smart choice!

Because we can't have a proper hero without some romantic tension, the local bar wench exerts some uncomfortable yet cute pressure in coupling Lisa (Ruth Bradley; Beauty and the Beast, Primeval) with O'Shea.  Ruth Bradley and Richard Coyle fair splendidly as a dainty prude who is drunk for the first time (in order to survive) flirting with a drunk who is trying to sober up to impress her.  The warm fuzzy levity is abundant and their flirtatious relationship comes off as shockingly convincing.  And by the way, Ruth Bradley really rises to the challenge of acting drunk.

They had some fun with the gore effects.  This movie isn't exactly ""gory"" but it still has its fun with rolling severed heads.  The CGI alien monsters look a lot like the giant facehugger that brings down the engineer towards the end of Prometheus (2012).  In fact, you'll delight in the cephalopodic mayhem when it actually ""facehugs"" a victim.  They look great!  Oh, and the hatchling grabbers make adorable squeaky sounds like a Pomeranian chew toy--they're so cuteuntil they attack.

The dialogue is nothing short of charming and excellent throughout the movie.  Almost any time I wasn't laughing out loud, I was grinning at the marriage of the silliness of these scenes coupled with oft-alcohol-induced dialogue.  The characters all play off of each other splendidly and the chemistry between O'Shea and his flirtatious rookie drinker Lisa is a much slurred splendor.",1394064000,,2196,5.081005586592179

5667186,4,B00BQRBGYA,"""Grabbers"" is one of those movies that's succinctly summed up in just one sentence: drunk guys fight off an alien invasion. So of course it takes place in Ireland.

Garda Ciar&aacute;n O'Shea (Richard Coyle) is an alcoholic with a sad past; he's teamed up with an attractive new partner, Garda Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley).  It seems Nolan has taken the assignment to prove herself and climb the ranks. It doesn't take long before they discover something strange going on at the island in the form of mutilated whale corpses. And that strange thing is aliens.

Some thought went into creating these aliens.  They're starfish-like creatures who have a brachiolaria stage of larval development -- they're cute little worms who make squeaky sounds and will chew your face off.  But as adults they're massive hulks that roll along like a floppy wheel on their many legs, akin to the wheeler spider. And oh yeah, they can't stand the taste of alcohol. Which is quite the plus when you own a bar.

O'Shea and Nolan assemble a crack team of experts to fight the so-called ""grabbers,"" including town drunk Paddy (Lalor Roddy), marine ecologist Dr. Smith (Russel Tovey), and pub owner Tadhg Murphy (Louis Dempsey) to execute a madcap plan: they invite all the residents of the town to celebrate an oncoming storm in Murphy's pub.  O'Shea stays sober to defend the pub while the villagers get plastered. What could possibly go wrong?

The biggest challenge for the rest of the humans is not the grabbers but their extreme intoxication.  They do stupid things -- things that everybody does in horror movies, but at least now they have an excuse -- that leads them right into the grabbers. It's hilariously stupid.

If the film has a flaw, it's the very awkward, not very believable romance between O'Shea and Nolan. O'Shea's a drunk because of a tragic past, you see, which makes the uptight Nolan -- who just needs to get drunk to loosen up -- see the light. Grabbers escalates as its monsters get more bold until it ends up with a clich&eacute;d standoff that involves explosions. But if ""Grabbers"" biggest problem is that it concludes with a satisfying boom...it's hard to fault it too much.",1390262400,,2180,4.804812834224599

Well, anyway, the actors were exceptional. The film was campy fun, and I'll not spoil anything in the film that isn't already in the trailer,
so, I'll just say that the blood-suckin' twenty-three-tentacled monster thrived on both water a-n-d blood, but alcohol was toxic to its
metabolism. The town has a lock-in drink-fest to keep the monster away from the door.
Despite a small budget --- the CGI special FX took almost two years, and --- people that LOVE such films donated a lot of their expertise

Netflix viewers have given Grabbers 4.5 Stars, and IMDB 6.1 out of 10. So I added it to my queue. Every time I scrolled over the movie, and read the plot-line, I groaned, and kept scrolling.

Today, I decided to try it. Figured, why not. Also, I am to write a Sea Monster story for my publisher. Watching Sea Monster films is homework, research. At least that's the way I see it. Research.

Anyway, let me start with this. I want to visit Ireland. The scenery in this film -- the hills, the ocean, the bluffs -- amazing and breathtaking beautiful. The movie opens with a fishing boat out at sea when a fisherman observes something like a comet rocket out of the sky and slam into the ocean. Thinking it might be a distress flare, the crew maneuver the ship for a closer look.

Officer Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradly) is on a ferry with a temporary assignment to work on the island. Officer O'Shea is not thrilled about Lisa's arrival. Figures she will be a thorn in his side, since he is an barely-functioning alcoholic. Lisa, coming from a city busy with drug raids, murders and rapes, is hoping the island will prove equally challenging. O'Shea assures her it will not be the case.

On land, the beach is covered with Pilot Whale carcasses. They're slightly ripped up, as if they had been attacked. Dr. Adam Smith (Russell Tovey) admits he's not sure exactly what has happened to the whales. Soon, bodies are discovered, bodies and the heads from bodies ...

Between eggs being laid, and a fisherman taking home some unknown creature he caught in a lobster cage, it becomes quickly clear that a new species is in town; alien to the waters, or alien to this world. Once it is realized that the creatures are similar to leaches, surviving on blood and water, it looks like there might not be a way to stop what is going on in town.

An odd discovery is made as a way to stop the monsters from attacking. The officers and doctor form a plan using this new information. It is quite possibly all they can think to do in an effort to save everyone from the sea monster  devouring people on land!

The acting is pretty good. The entire cast did an amazing job. There were no small parts! I feel like the first half of the movie was more horror with some humor. The second half was more humor with some horror. Feel like they may have tried to re-capture the magic of bound-to-be cult classic Shaun of the Dead. Nice thought. Fell short. Not saying it wasn't humorous. It was. It just wasn't funny. There is a difference. The special effects and creature creations were not bad. Better than I'd seen in some huge budget films. Again, the scenes with monsters ranged from horror to humor -- but were done well.

Plenty of irony in the film. Some in your face, some not so in your face -- but still there if you see it. Written by Kevin Lehane, directed by Jon Wright, this 94 minute movie is Not Rated. Based on some profane language and mild blood and gore, I'd say it was rated between PG-13 and R. For a B-Horror / Comedy .. I'd have to give Grabbers 4 out of 5 Tombstones!

We simply didn't have the label. Then when ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" came out as a ""cult"" film it ticked me off. You don't set out to make a cult film. You set out to make a film that may, through audience reaction, become a cult film. Seems to me the makers of this flick were trying to make a cult film.

Here's the scoop. Something comes down from outer space and splashes into the waters off a sleepy Irish Island. A creature emerges and begins feeding off the local populace. Said creature needs two things: Blood and water. However, the blood can't have any alcohol in it. The locals figure this out and proceed to get hammered while the head cop, and his fetching, temporary deputy try to determine how to dispatch this nasty intruder.

This is a rather fun romp. The set up is similar to ""The Blob"" and ""Slither."" The characters are more 'type' than they are round, and, the entire town needing to get sloshed to avoid becoming monster chow, takes too much of the horror out of it. In ""The Blob"" and ""Slither"", as light as parts of those films might play, when the doo-doo hits the fan, they become genuinely scary. This flick also pays homage to/borrows from/steals from ""Alien"" and ""Aliens."" This might not have bothered me so much had the film itself been better. The monster effects are pretty decent. The script also telegraphed certain things you knew had to come into play later on. I like being surprised so this took a little away from the enjoyment for me. Now, the directing. There were 8 or 10 film companies involved in the production. Seems to me they could have come up with a better director and camera man.

Don't expect huge laughs but its still an enjoyable little flick worth your rental dollar.",1380499200,,355,4.741935483870968
5667212,3,B00BQRBGYA,"GRABBERS serves up clever and and original concept: Aliens creatures that can be killed by alcohol attack an Irish pub. I'll drink to that!

This film works thanks to creepy effects and a solid cast headed up by Richard Coyle and Ruth Bradley who portray the overwhelmed local constabulary. The rest of the players are just as skilled and instantly recognizable from other, serious dramatic roles. Speaking of Ms Bradley, if you haven't seen her break out performance as Caroline Reid in the true-life thriller, IN HER SKIN, check it out. Bradley is amazing.

If you're a fan of old-fashioned alien invasion flicks, make up a batch of popcorn, and settle in with GRABBERS.",1379808000,,672,4.885964912280702
5667213,5,B00BQRBGYA,...you'll love this! Very funny and well-acted. The Irish version of Tremors -- just as funny and just as exciting.,1378512000,2,115,4.8

5667218,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Very fun movie.  It reminded me, more than once, of Shawn of the Dead.  There's not much of a plot, but the characters are hilarious.  Writing is good, but not consistent.
Most of the acting is good, with a few weak spots.  The plot setup is done well -- just enough scenes to explain the movie monster and instill fear for the viewer to enjoy.
The climax is clever and makes sense.  If you like Simon Pegg's funny stuff, this movie is very similar.",1376784000,19,449,4.2976190476190474
5667219,4,B00BQRBGYA,This is a nice departure from most of the recent horror movies that look to shock instead of entertain.  This movie is a fun campy horror movie that you could certainly watch with your tweens.  I would compare it to other fun monster movies such as Tremors.,1376784000,2,257,4.446808510638298
5667220,3,B00BQRBGYA,"this is a film in the genre of tongue in cheek sci fi that includes ""serenity"" or ""host"" or any movie put out on the syfy channel. the terrors are brief and merciful, the monsters horribly improbable, and the assorted human victims and heros inept but lovable. especially because they are routinely drunk and cursing. there isn't a whole lot to it -- monsters invade, and only whiskey can save the irish -- but the cast chemistry is quite good and really the main enjoyments are the comic characterizations, idiotic arguments, and loving shots of the irish countryside. i especially liked ruth bradley as the prim and proper female police officer who gets undone in a goofy drinking scene; she reminds me of kate winslett.",1376611200,,722,4.784
5667221,5,B00BQRBGYA,"Honestly, I am SO tired of the endless repeated scripts of most movies.  This one was a treat.

5667223,4,B00BQRBGYA,"Well-made, funny, scary and thoroughly entertaining Monster flick in the mode of Tremors, or even Arachnophobia.  The creature effects are excellent, the acting fine, and the story about a town coming together to battle a threat was a real treat.  Plus is had ""George the Werewolf"" from the UK version of ""Being Human in it.

The conceit that the creature can't tolerate eating drunk people adds a layer of comedy to lighten the mood.  Great chemistry between the lead characters with great and off-beat supporting characters.  Highly reccommemded!",1376092800,6,548,5.181818181818182
5667224,4,B00BQRBGYA,"I am constantly looking for new monster movies to watch, hopefully enjoy and then add to my movie collection. Unfortunately, more often than not, these films end up being comparable to a Syfy Channel movie of the week (in other words, it sucks). Thankfully, every once in awhile one comes along that stands out. Such is the case with the 2012 release of GRABBERS.

I first read about this film in HorrorHound Magazine, and though it was getting good feedback, the premise certainly couldve gone either way. Blood-sucking, tentacled aliens invade the coast of Ireland where the locals only hope of survival lies in their ability to get drunk! So how good could this film actually be? REALLY good!!!

This horror-comedy is actually an Irish production and definitely stands way above any Syfy Channel original film. Fishermen accidentally catch an alien cephalopod in their lobster pots. They eventually realize that this species feeds off of the blood of humans (of course) but that if they have a strong alcohol content in their blood, it can hurt, and even kill, the alien menace. Obviously the aliens are not that smart if this is their weakness and they arrive in Ireland.

This movie has great characters, with great chemistry. The two leads, Ciarn OShea and Lisa Nolan, bring the whole thing together. They are both police officers, with Lisa covering for a vacationing officer. Ciarn, played by Richard Coyle is an alcoholic trying to quit and Lisa, played by Ruth Bradley, has never had a drop of alcohol in her life. This makes for a good plot twist as Ciarn quits drinking to impress Lisa and Lisa must get wasted to save the town.

The characters are all very likeable and they all put on a great performance of being drunk. The aliens themselves, done with really good CGI, look amazing and some of the scenes are really impressive. The movie moves at a quick pace and there are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments. This is definitely a movie I highly recommend and you do not need to add alcohol to make it watchable. As of this writing this film is available on Video On Demand through Amazon, with a blu-ray release scheduled for later this year. Check it out! You will not be disappointed!",1376006400,42,2207,4.769633507853404
5667225,5,B00BQRBGYA,I really liked this movie. It was funny but not stupid funny. Overall I was really entertained by it. Would recommend to others,1375660800,2,127,4.565217391304348
5667226,4,B00BQRBGYA,A blood drinking giant alien comes to Earth in order to reproduce.  It needs human blood (we assume as no animals get eaten) to survive.  The only drawback is that it is violently allergic to alcohol and will die if it consumes any.  It lands off the coast of Ireland.  This movie is definitely worth the money if you are a fan of the horror comedy genera.  The acting is decent (definitely B+ movie quality) and the premise is very original.  The only drawback is that the main male character takes the stereotype role of drunk Irish cop too far at times.  He tends to come off as a caricature (of course this is a B movie so that's OK).  The special effects are really good for the budget and the scenery along the Irish coast is very beautiful.  All in all I would recommend to any fan of this type of movie.,1375660800,,811,4.248366013071895

5667228,5,B00BQRBGYA,"I love movies where I can see faraway places I'll never go. This film is set on an island area off Ireland's coast and featured likable people whose realness carries the film.

It's been a LONG TIME that I have watched a horror film where I cared so much for characters that I was terrified for their safety. Usually, I am so irritated by the selfishness, sarcasm, and general meanness of the characters that I am cheering when they die.

Not so in GRABBERS. I loved these characters and their fondness for one another. GRABBERS is like any other ""desert island"" film like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or TREMORS but what GRABBERS is missing is the ""mean character"" whose selfish motives endanger everyone. Just like in the film TREMORS, the characters in GRABBERS work together to defeat the monsters. Moreover, the characters in GRABBERS discover an interesting defense against the title boogers that I'll let you discover.

See this film and don't psychoanalyze it, don't look at it through a cultural lens, just watch it and enjoy the emotion and some of the coolest monsters I've seen in a while.",1375574400,17,1097,4.732984293193717

I thought this was going to be a scary movie where people over acted and had under written lines.
