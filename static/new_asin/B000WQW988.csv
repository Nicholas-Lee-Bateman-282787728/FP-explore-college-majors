2989342,5,B000WQW988,"Words cannot express how I feel about this performance.  Nirvana gave us a collection of sonic masterpieces, while others remember them for the album NEVERMIND, it is this performance that will be remembered as their finest hour.  Tonight I finally got to see this show on VH1 along with a bare witness documentary of those who were there.

I pre-ordered the dvd a few days ago and even paid extra so it gets to me ASAP.

Finally NIRVANA has come home.

Come as you Are!",1195344000,,470,4.482352941176471
2989343,5,B000WQW988,"All I can say is ""THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!""  Thank God this is finally available on DVD.  I have been waiting since the first time I saw it on Unplugged.  Words can not describe how great this performace is.  Everytime I listen to the CD I realize how much we lost when Kurt died.",1195171200,,290,4.125
2989344,5,B000WQW988,"Yes, it's about F******* time. Now I can finally toss out my old VHS recording of this legendary performance.",1194998400,,109,4.7894736842105265
2989345,5,B000WQW988,"First of all, this show took place on my 21st birthday.  While I was not there, I remember being absolutely floored when I first saw this performance on MTV.  You have to remember, Nirvana had never played these songs acoustically before this -  they were grunge, loud, full of feedback.  Then they go and play this show.  It gave them such a new dynamic, a sign of things that could've come for Nirvana had they continued.  Not a dud in the whole show, every song is a classic, from their incredible interpretation of Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" to the show closer ""All Apologies"".

I have seen thousands of concerts by hundreds of bands, both live and on video (I'm a video DJ and collect live concert footage), and I would have to put this in as one of the top 5 shows by a single band ever.  Absolutely amazing....

Now when is Pearl Jam's Unplugged show going to come out?",1194566400,,886,4.386503067484663
2989346,5,B000WQW988,"Oh, it's about time they released this masterful unplugged set by Nirvana. It's been a travesty for too long that this wasn't available, but at least now the dream is coming true. The best unplugged set MTV ever did, in my humble opinion.",1194480000,,238,4.558139534883721
2989347,5,B000WQW988,"This performance cemented Nirvana's reputation as being more than just a band of the moment, it elevated Kurt Cobain to the pantheon of great musician/songwriters and convinced any naysayers that he truly was THE artist of his generation. Songs from Nevermind and In Utero like ""All Apologies"" and ""Something In The Way,"" stripped to their skeletal parts, revealed facets previously unnoticed, and a depth the studio versions failed to capture. Nirvana's Unplugged performance became the measuring stick against all other Unplugged performances, and nothing held a candle to it. It has become a moment in time for a generation, and it was no wonder that MTV replayed the performance ad infinitum when Kurt was found dead in his home several months later. It also happens to be the one performance that bears repeat viewing, which owes much to the careful orchestration of the set and song choices by Nirvana. From the start with a ""ABOUT A GIRL"" a song from the first Nirvana album, which Kurt states 'no one really knows this song,' to the cathartic final performance of ""WHERE DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT"" culminating in a primal scream, which still gives me chills when I see it.

I can't wait to see this again, and again...",1194393600,9,1225,4.889423076923077
2989348,5,B000WQW988,"Can't wait for this to arrive. I was exstatic to hear they are going to release it on dvd. Now that I see that this disc is going to be loaded with extras, I'm completely over the moon. I whish it's the 20th already!!!!!!",1194307200,,221,4.045454545454546
2989349,5,B000WQW988,"This is the best unplugged performance ever and one of the best live acoustic recordings from the 90s. It was all recorded in one take, not like other unplugged concerts from other bands.

This is pure honest live music at is best, a legendary performance indeed.
A must have for anyone that enjoys good music.",1193875200,5,310,4.636363636363637
2989350,5,B000WQW988,"It is about F*ckin' time they release this legendary concert to dvd, or even to have it officially released period.  I Will def. be picking this dvd up on it's release date.  I will forever be a fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.  PS.  no more ppl forking out $50 or more for a crappy bootleg, this is OFFICIAL BABY! WHOOHOO! (Below is the offical Press release)

LOS ANGELES, October 23, 2007 - Nearly 14 years to the day of the filming of Nirvana's landmark ""MTV Unplugged"" performance, that raw, revealing and emotionally gripping acoustic concert previously seen only on television will be available for the first time on DVD. Unplugged In New York (Geffen/MTV Networks/UMe) will be released on November 20, 2007 and will feature the complete, unedited 66-minute concert including ""Something In The Way"" and ""Oh Me"" not aired during the original 44-minute broadcast. Unplugged In New York also includes five previously unreleased rehearsal performances and MTV News interviews with the band and audience members.

Filmed November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios, the show first aired on MTV on December 14, 1993; just four months before the untimely passing of Kurt Cobain. Unplugged In New York DVD is now presented in both Dolby Stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound and includes both the shorter original broadcast version, and Nirvana's entire unedited performance. When released on CD in November 1994, MTV Unplugged In New York debuted #1, won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996 and was quickly certified five times platinum.

Favoring a selection of carefully chosen tracks over the band's hits, Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl perform acoustic versions of Nirvana's ""About A Girl,"" ""Come As You Are,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea,"" ""Dumb,"" ""Polly,"" ""On A Plain,"" ""Something In The Way"" and ""All Apologies."" Six other songs are covers that mined Nirvana's musical diversity and depth, from David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold The World"" and The Vaselines' version of ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam"" to the trad folk ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" associated with Leadbelly and the Meat Puppets' ""Plateau,"" ""Oh, Me"" and ""Lake Of Fire."" Meat Puppets singer-guitarist Curt Kirkwood and bassist brother Cris Kirkwood perform with Nirvana on those tracks. Also seen and heard throughout are Nirvana's touring guitarist Pat Smear, an original Germs member and the original and now recurrent guitarist of The Foo Fighters.

The DVD adds the MTV News ""Bare Witness"" feature of interviews with the band, the MTV production staff, and fans in the audience, plus the rehearsal footage for ""Come As You Are,"" ""Polly,"" ""Plateau,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""The Man Who Sold The World.""

The well-thought out set list includes covers that shine, and moments of unexpected humour.  This is one of my most prized DVDs.  It's one thing to listen to the enjoyable soundtrack alone, but watching the members play and sing brings their performance into full focus.  The sound quality and camera work are outstanding.  MTV was great at the visuals and sound, and this is no exception.  Buy this later bonus version which has the practice session and the in between banter unfiltered.  Perfect.  This is in fact where I fell in love with Nirvana and have been intensely exploring them ever since.",1464307200,,768,4.801526717557252

2989435,5,B000WQW988,"Of all the Nirvana dvd's available, ""MTV Unplugged in New York"" is my absolute favorite.  I've been a Nirvana fan for over 20 years and love all their music.  I watched the original show when it aired on MTV in 1993 and couldn't wait for it to be released.  I purchased a cassette tape of
Nirvana ""Unplugged"" as soon as it hit the record stores.  I played that tape in my car until it was no longer functional.  I eventually replaced it with a cd for the same reason.  Again, I played the cd until it was all scratched up from constant listening.  I finally replaced the cd last year and decided to get the dvd so I could ""relive the 90's"" (when Nirvana was at the top of the charts).

I love Nirvana's acoustic versions of ""About a Girl"", ""Pennyroyal Tea"", ""Come As You Are"", and ""All Apologies"". I love their cover songs too.

Despite the great premise, most of the unplugged specials aren't very good, this is really one of the few exceptions. This one seemed doomed from the beginning with Kurt Cobain being dope sick and uncooperative with the shows producers. He threatened not to play several times and the show only went on at the last possible minute. What resulted was probably one of their best live performances recorded for posterity in full color. They would play only 9 more shows before Cobain took his life 6 months after the recording of this concert.",1413590400,2,631,4.851851851851852

2989486,5,B000WQW988,"This great DVD shows the original uncut recording, with all of the commercial break pauses and other random chit chat, along with the original MTV broadcast (which didn't include ""Oh, Me"". It also has all of the looseness (not to mention an impromptu rendition of Sweet Home Alabama) that you don't get in the superbly-edited CD recording. The MTV broadcast, for example, edits out the story of the offer of Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000 (apparently the offer was only a tenth of that, but it's always more interesting to exaggerate a story), while both the MTV broadcast and the CD edit out Kurt's mispronunciation of David Geffen as David ""Gessen"". It also edits out the profanity, such as ""fart you all, this is the last song of the evening"" before the band goes into an insanely good ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night."" Funny, he pretends to smash a guitar at the end of the set, before walking off. Ah yes, Kurt - in those days he walked, he talked, he smoked, he gave autographs... he loved his wife and his daughter... then he blew his brains out and selfishly deprived all of us of himself and his songs. But hey, what did he owe us? How can one person just give and give and give and give...?

It's cool to see him so close, his glassy stare, his occasional smile, the way his jaw shifts in strange ways, how he seems to sing so effortlessly, how he hardly seems to move from his perch at the edge of his band, who sit so far behind him. Krist slack-jawes, Dave Grohl trying to be light-hearted, Pat Smear off to the side and looking a bit amused with it all... The biggest revelation of the DVD is the banter between the last two songs and a strange audience interaction when they request REM's ""Pretty Persuasion"" (?!?!), and one woman screams lustily ""RAPE ME!!!"" A shocked, yet devilish smile from Kurt here. ""I don't think MTV will let us play that.""

The DVD also has a weird ""interviews with"" a bunch of irrelevant people who were there or involved backstage. It's very different from the spirit of the show. There are also a few samples of the practice session, where we hear that Kurt's vocals are too low in ""Polly"", how his voice cracks already in ""Plateau"", not to mention how you get to see Curt Kirkwood singing along to his own songs (as we do in the main set).

Nirvana's Unplugged is not only the best edition of Unplugged, but one of the true great live performances.  As many other reviews have noted, the majority of the songs performed by Nirvana weren't particularly well-known songs by the band except for ""Come As You Are"" and ""Polly"", and several of the songs are actually covers of other artists' songs.  In fact, for years I thought ""The Man Who Sold the World"" was a Nirvana song.  Some of the best songs are covers of Meat Puppets songs, ""Plateau"" and ""Lake of Fire"".

2989507,5,B000WQW988,"Despite being a die hard NIRVANA fan; I never purchased this dvd because I had recorded it on SP mode (VHS) and it was in tremendous quality. Furthermore, I recorded it onto a DVD-R so I was extremely happy with the show. However, I thought about NIRVANA unplugged because of the 19th anniversary of the show and decided to impromptu buy it. ***IF you are a serious fan than this is a pre-requisite. I am so happy with the DVD for a myriad of reasons, which I will provide in thorough detail.

Okay, the main thing that I liked about the DVD was that it provided context to discrepancies between the CD, ""Unplugged in New York"" and the MTV performance. For example, the songs were not in the same sequential order. I knew that two songs had been omitted, but Dumb was track 6 on the CD and performed 4th on MTV. That always perplexed me. Why did that happen? What was I missing? If you ever felt the same I am going to begin answering these questions.

Well, first off I will detail what is actually on the DVD for an attention getter: The MTV performance as aired many times, rehearsals, a documentary on the event; entitled Bare Witness and The unedited performance from Nov. 18, 1993. (Really as if you were there in the audience.)

The MTV performance has been broadcast thousands of times, but in case you aren't a die hard fan I will detail the track listing. It is as follows:

1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. Dumb. 5. The man who sold the world. 6. Pennyroyal tea. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Plateau. 10. Lake of fire. 11. All Apologies. & 12. Where did you sleep last night?

The Rehearsals are really enlightening because some of the dialogue heard on the CD makes sense now. I would imagine NIRVANA rehearsed more than 20 minutes, but maybe not. The included Rehearsal set list is as follows:

1. Come as you are. 2. Polly. 3. Plateau. 4. Pennyroyal tea. 5. The man who sold the world.

The ""Bare Witness"" documentary aired on MTV back in 1999 and is approx. 15 minutes. I hated this documentary back then and feel comparable today.

& The unedited performance. The GEM. It not only included the missing two songs; Oh me and something in the way, but also qualifies a proper dialogue context.  The set list here is the same as the CD, but way better.  Having said that...the set list is as follows:

1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. The man who sold the world. 5. Pennyroyal tea. 6. Dumb. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Something in the way. 10. Plateau. 11. Oh me. 12. Lake of fire. 13. All apologies. 14. Where did you sleep last night?

Okay, I have laid out what is on the dvd; now I can finally give you some specificity to what I have been saying repeatedly about context. I'll break down the unedited performance and reference the MTV performance and rehearsals too.

Unplugged in New York opened with audience clapping. Well, on the unedited performance you see who this people are. You see the band come out on stage and sit down. Kurt opened up by saying ""Hello here."" This would lead to the intro of about a girl. There isn't much of a break before the band starts come as you are; similar to the MTV performance.

Next, Kurt Cobain introduces Lori Goldston, the cello player, and Dave Grohl acknowledges the new guitar player Pat Smear. People seem to forget that Smear was going to be a full fledge member of the band moving forward. It saddens me  that this fact is totally forsaken. For instance, he isn't even listed on NIRVANA's wikipedia page as a member. He is at the bottom as only a touring member. Kurt said, many times that Smear was going to help contribute on the next album. My point is he wasn't just an extra guy that appeared, for the first time, on Saturday Night Live in Sept. 1993. He was a legitimate member and on the unedited version of Unplugged; that point is conveyed albeit briefly.

Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam goes by just like it did on the MTV performance. Do you remember when Kurt said I guarantee you I will screw this song up? He was talking about The man who sold the world and this dvd explains why. Kurt was having problems with Pat's guitar, on the song intro, during the rehearsals. He appears moderately frustrated. I.e. in a constructive non condescending manor.  The song is terrific leading up to Pennyroyal tea.

I always wondered why Kurt asked am I going to do this by myself? Well, during the rehearsals the song really wasn't going well. Initially, they had Pat playing guitar and also singing backup. Scott Litt, the sound technician, suggests that Grohl play guitar and Smear focus on the backing vocals. This really didn't improve things and Kurt was playing the song in a different key too.

Therefore, Kurt asks am I going to do this song by myself? Another part that was edited out of the MTV performance...Grohl asks Smear Are you not going to sing? Then quickly he answers Kurt with do it by yourself. Kurt acknowledged that he was going to play in the normal key, by himself, and it is absolute BRILLIANCE. OUTSTANDING. 100 percent better than rehearsal.

Next, Kurt opines that we can't play dumb next. However, he quickly concludes that Unplugged is taped and MTV will edit it differently anyway. He would have to tune his guitar down to a D for on a plain. Thus, they decided to play dumb next. Afterwards, on the unedited version, Kurt says we can't play those two songs back-to-back because they are the same song.

There really isn't anything new with Polly in the performance. Kurt needed his vocals raised the rehearsals and Grohl sang out of key. However, on the unedited performance it came together perfectly again.

Again, On a plain is virtually the same as the MTV performance. Moreover, Something in the way is the exactly the same as heard on Unplugged in New York the cd. However, at the beginning of the unedited performance, Kurt asks Grohl to play a beat to help him keep time.

You always hear how raw NIRVANA was as a band, rightfully so, and that is on display after something in the way. They don't even have a set list authenticated. Moreover, there was no cue for the Meat Puppets to come on stage.

Kurt starts to drink tea after something in the way when someone may have told him to hurry up. This leads to Kurt and Krist Novoselic discussing an old show called Davie & Goliath. Kurt mentions that there was episode in particular that scared him as a boy. And, that it wasn't very Christian. What's next? Oh, we're supposed to play Meat Puppets songs. Right, Kurt asks?

The Meat Puppets come on stage very slowly. All in all there is about a 5 minute delay between songs. The banter is fantastic though. Kurt references Nine Inch Nails and a fan screams out for FREE BIRD. Kurt facetoiusly indicated that he was expecting somebody to say that.

Krist starts playing Sweet Home Alabama and Kurt rips into shreds with mocking vocals. The crowd laughs. I hate Lynard Skynard! I really enjoyed this part of the unedited performance obviously. What song is next is asked again. What are they tuning a harp? Kurt asked that on Unplugged in New York and it makes sense now because why is this taking so long?

NIRVANA runs through Plateau, Oh me, new in the Unedited version, and Lake of fire. Afterwards, Kurt plugs their cd. Thank you, Nirvana! You hear the Meat Puppets say that just like Unplugged in New York. What's next? Another delay. Extremely interesting though. Kurt asks any requests?

The crowd shouts out Sliver a few times. Krist plays a bit of the riff. You get a Marigold reference here. Next, Somebody says in bloom. Kurt is bewildered by that. ""How are we supposed to do In Bloom acoustically?"" This created quite the dichotomy because All apologies is next.

All apologies is always the footage shown of Kurt when talking about his suicide. He looks and feels depressed with the context of said clip. However, he is talking to the fan about In Bloom and actually starts the song, but Pat isn't ready. He looks back at Krist and Pat says I'm sorry. The song is started again. The point is he was in a good mood prior to the song beginning. It is quite the juxtaposition when considering the all apologies footage on documentaries and newsroom B-roll.

Grohl asks, after all apologies, why don't we do sliver? Kurt says, I don't think that would work well. Grohl agrees, thinking, yeah you have to scream on it. The subject of requests comes up again. D-7 is mentioned, but Kurt repudiates that by saying that isn't our song. The irony being they had performed covers all night. Kurt was actually who pointed that out. The crowd yells TEEN SPIRIT. Thankfully, the band didn't play it or even acknowledge the fan.

A female fan yells for Rape me and Grohl asks was that Kennedy? He is so Funny! Kennedy was an MTV VJ at the time.

I don't think MTV will let us play that one, Kurt said. This was a reference to the 1992 MTV VMAs. Ironically, NIRVANA was allowed to play Rape me on the Live N Loud special that air just one month later. Anyway....Krist starts telling the Led belly guitar story that you hear on Unplugged in New York. He tried to get David Geffen to buy it for him etc.

This leads to Where did you sleep last night? The song was spectacular and maybe a poignant send off for Kurt? Cliche. I am typing this at work. 4a.m. Just pondering. Bottom line it was great, but what happened after? The cd and MTV performance just end. I always wanted this rectified. You sort of get this on the unedited performance.

It gets conspicuously  quite in the room and Kurt begins to sign a few autographs. He hated to do that, but didn't seem disingenuous here. Krist is standing behind Kurt and appears to be getting ready to ask Kurt; well, what did you think of our performance? The unedited DVD fades here. I was disappointed by that because I wanted to see the ending in totality. Nevertheless, the unedited DVD is powerful. I highly recommend it, even if you have the MTV performance recorded like I did.

Lastly, that Bare Witness documentary is on the special features. Lewis Largent, VP to MTV Programming, kept saying things like what are these songs they are playing on Unplugged? He intimates that the covers were played here for the first time. That is absolutely false. NIRVANA was playing Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam in their 1991 set-list. Where did you sleep last night? had been played, electrically, too. Finally, Largent was like SPECIAL GUEST.. maybe Pearl Jam? No, not Pearl Jam. Forget the debated Kurt/Eddie Vedder personal feud. It is a fact that Kurt thought Pearl Jam's music was less than mediocre. Additionally, he thought they were made by a producer to exploit the Seattle sound. In another words, Pearl Jam exemplified the grunge trend that he resented.

Bare Witness also has a few fans talking about being there. It just seems pretentious to me. I.e  Perhaps, those ""fans"" didn't even attend the show to begin with. The documentary is salvaged, I guess, with a good interview of Alex Coletti. He was the Unplugged producer at that time. Nothing new was added. It is the exact same piece that aired on MTV, I still have on VHS, in fall 1999.

Seeing Nirvana, seeing Kurt performing on a tape for more than 3-4 minutes (one song) - was not something I experienced ever in my life. This DVD left me completely speechless and made my heartbeat stop just to capture a a simple moment, like one of my greatest wishes came through.

This is Kurt singing with his deepest emotions, with the saddest look on his face and the best, the best performance Nirvana ever did. It's also worthy to say that is not only completely amazing to see Kurt sing, but also it is very agonizing (at least for me) to see Kurt in this light.

2989534,5,B000WQW988,"I know that Nevermind's the one that gets all the glory, but this has always been my favorite Nirvana release. The group's work is just as good in electric mode as it is in acoustic format, and sometimes even better - as much as I love ""Come As You Are"", ""About a Girl"" and ""On a Plain"" in their studio versions, I think they even get better in an acoustic setting. Plus where else are you gonna find treasures like the Meat Puppets set (those Kirkwood brothers can PLAY!), the totally screwed-up version of ""Pennyroyal Tea"", where he totally flubs the lyrics, their brilliant covers of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" (which I think is better than Bowie's original), the Vaselines' ""Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam"", with a great accordion (NOT an oxymoron, by the way), and one of my favorite Nirvana tunes, ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"", which has some CREEPY screaming at the end. Not to mention that version of ""All Apologies""... even redundant, already acoustic tunes like ""Dumb"", ""Polly"", and ""Something in the Way"" are still amazing.
Of course, you can get all that on the CD, but here's some reason to buy the DVD. For one, the between-song banter is expanded upon, and unlike the usual between-song banter (which usually consists of the whole ""Are you ready to ROCK? I can't hear you, over all the ROCK! Show me your SOUL, San Fransisco!""), is really funny. I especially like the little jokes they make at Lynyrd Skynyrd's expense when the Meat Puppet guys come on (nothing against Skynyrd, I just find that mumbled joke run-through of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" funny, and the puns about ""Free Bird"" funnier). Plus the set - the candles and flowers - looks cool. And it's funny to hear the ridiculous songs people shout for near the coda.

I was already a big fan of the Unplugged CD, but I'd never seen the MTV broadcast. I bought this DVD hoping for a good show. It far exceeded my expectations.

Kurt Cobain was dead years before I ever even heard of Nirvana. I got to know Nirvana through their audio. I avoided media coverage and other people's opinions on Kurt Cobain, because I can't stand celebrity worship or misguided fascination with his suicide. The man was incredibly talented. He made great music. He put his soul into his music. He cared about his work. Those are the nicest things I can say about almost any stranger.

Anyway, the concert is great. The band knew MTV would edit the show for broadcast, and  it's relaxed, unhurried, and unaffected. The Unplugged album is a great showcase for Cobain's voice, and this show is even better. Neither the man nor his lips move much. He doesn't seem to be trying. In other words, he seems sincere. The band is infinitely more interesting to watch than any fan boy ever led me to believe. It felt good, to see this for myself. I can wear a Nirvana T-shirt now.

Cobain also seems high. He was addicted to heroin around the time this was recorded so... maybe.

2989544,5,B000WQW988,"It's been fifteen years since this show aired on MTV. Since then, the accompanying CD has become a staple with most fans of the band, while the show itself became a distant memory. On one hand, it just doesn't feel like fifteen years have passed since then; the music still sounds fresh, vital and contemporary. On the other hand, my son barely knew how to walk when this was filmed, and now he's applying for a driver's license. I guess perspective is everything. In its time, the most jarring aspect of this performance rested in how well these songs worked in an acoustic environment. Here was this intense, electrified, post-punk indie band playing at James Taylor volumes. Kurt Cobain remains seated throughout, while Dave Grohl plays his drums with a deft touch, using brushes. Against all expectations, the show rocked in ways that nobody could have predicted, and finally, the evidence is available on DVD for all to see.
 So many of these songs are classics in their own right, but many have been surpassed by the specific versions featured in this program. ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam,"" ""The Man Who Sold the World,"" ""All Apologies"" and ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"" represent some of the best music that our culture had to offer, and what held true in '93 still holds true today. This performance seemed simple and charming in its time, but has grown to represent so much more. Watching this, it is impossible to not mourn the loss of Kurt Cobain. What he could have achieved is incalculable, but there is so much evidence here pointing to the raw and crucial nature of his artistic creativity. We are so much worse off without him than we tend to acknowledge. Considering that he passed away within six months of this show, it now takes on the airs of a eulogy, an impression that is heightened by the candles and flowers that adorn the stage.
 On a technical note, this DVD contains the unedited performance, including songs that did not appear on the original MTV broadcast. For purists and impatient types, it also contains the edited version as aired by MTV. The extra tracks and between-song banter only add to the casual brilliance of this performance, and the recording is so crystal clear that you can hear the texture of Grohl's brushes on the cymbals. As rock and roll films go, this is classic, like footage from Woodstock, or Altamont. It seemed so simple at the time, but nothing like it has appeared since then. An entire generation has now come of age that never had the opportunity to see Nirvana, and specifically this show. Now that I've watched it a few times, I know what I must do. I need to give this to my son. before he leaves for college.

2989549,5,B000WQW988,"I had listened to Nirvana's most well known tracks back in the early 90s, and I knew of the circumstances surrounding Kurt's death. But - since I had not taken serious notice of Kurt and Nirvana early on, I didn't fully realize why some people on the radio were so vocally mournful of his passing.

Then in late 2006, my then 13 year-old son got me reinterested in grunge music and Nirvana at a deeper level. We were stuck in slow car ride during a snowstorm with only a Nirvana CD in the car. I listened to several tracks I hadn't heard before, either because I was a tuned out baby-boomer and/or they didn't receive the airplay. Following up, I listened to a lot more and it was a musical reawakening.

I later bought the unplugged DVD as an early holiday present for my son, and it ended up being a present for both of us. I actually kept it after our first watching - and viewed it late at night while I was doing some laptop work. In summary - watching this video makes you wish Kurt could be resurrected. This is a truly great live performance! It's like being in the living room with a relaxed, yet well-rehearsed and enormously creative artist.

Biggest pluses - the unplugged version of ""All Apologies"" is even better than the already great studio version. Great collaboration with the Meat Puppets - especially ""Lake of Fire."" Kurt's take on Leadbelly's ""Where Did you Sleep Last Night"" is riveting. There was a good measure of low-key but effective humor and side comments.

This performance was humble yet visually interesting to watch. They did not need to ""put on a show"" to move their audience. To Nirvana's credit, this performance was actually the antithesis of stagemanship. And that is because the stagemanship was not necessary.

My only regret is that they didn't include an unplugged version of ""Heart Shaped Box"" in this collection. For that, you need to pick up the ""Wishkah"" CD (or download the MP3). The Wishkah is a river near Kurt's native Aberdeen WA. This information I gained from a recent film ""About a Son,"" which is an exceptionally well-done retospective documentary.

I agree with Tom Petty in regard to a comment he made about Nirvana being ""the most significant band since the Beatles."" Kurt Cobain was a truly amazing talent - and it ended far too soon.",1200528000,,2292,4.6330049261083746

I have never felt so in touch with any band until I watched this. It makes you feel like you are there, back in 1993 just watching him goof around and be real. It shows him and the band in the most raw footage ever. Every facial expression, every word, every comment... its just Kurt through and through. I nearly cried, and believe me I'm not one to show emotion. But, for a moment it felt as if he was still alive I guess... I always wished I could have met him or gone to one of his concerts. And now with this dvd I can experience the true Nirvana experience anytime I want. There is nothing I could say that would in anyway be a critic of this dvd. It is Nirvana in its perfection. The way you remebered them, the way you always will. This truely does the band every bit of justice that they deserve. I swear I have watched it several times within the last few day in amazement, of course driving my fam crazy...lol. I fell in love with the band all over. That is amazing.

I'm glad they took their time to release this performance with all the nowadays technical standards in sound & picture quality. What amazed me the most it's the new Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 mix by Elliot Scheiner, even the rehearsals are featured in full discrete true surround sound, you can hear clearly every single instrument coming from all different channels and of course everything is well placed. If it wasn't enough there's the 2 channel version which is far superior to the original CD.

Picture quality it's quite good for a 14 plus year old broadcast performance, seeing this concert it was hard to believe for me that unfortunately Kurt is dead and Nirvana doesn't exist anymore, specially because it feels like it was filmed yesterday, image is polished, crisp and bright as it should be.

I had seen this concert the night it was first aired on MTV and I loved it. This is the last live performance that Kurt Cobain ever gave before his tragic death. This acoustic performance is among Nirvana's best. The power of Kurt's voice is breathtaking. This performance proves that Nirvana was one of the greatest and most talented bands ever. The best performance, in my opinion, is ""Pennyroyal Tea"". Kurt does this song all by himself and it showcases the true talent that he possessed. This is such a great concert because it was performed in front of a very small audience and in an intimate setting. Very nicely done. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves Nirvana. You won't be disappointed!",1198800000,,817,4.453333333333333

The visual and sound qualities are excellent, the extras add a bit more for your dollar but the actual performance footage is more than enough. The DVD contains the entire recorded performance except for Sweet Home Alabama which I don't believe the band plays completely in any case. For people who know Nirvana only as a rock band and Kurt Cobain as the more often than not raving singer/guitarist, his performance will stun you ear drums with the beautiful sounds his voice shows when singing in a different style and format. All of the musicians, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl (drummer, now lead singer guitarist of Foo Fighters)display a dexterity in musical style that I really enjoyed. The slower pace & different key of the music played here allows you to hear the lyrics better, and the instruments more individually played. The solos by Kurt are sometimes heartbreaking  when heard in the hindsight of his untimely death. Oh Me, a Meat Puppet  cover, Something in the Way, Pennyroyal Tea, and Dumb, are particularly poignant. About A Girl, Come As You Are, All Apologies, Polly are equally excellent. There isn't a song on here I didn't like. It's said Kurt was under the influence at the time, or indulged afterwards with serious consequences--whatever the tongue-waggers wanted to make of it, he & the band put in an excellent, professional performance irregardless of any extenuating circumstances.",1198713600,,1523,5.015810276679842

I wish that the Audio was full bitrate DTS instead of the half-bitrate on offer, as the video quality is not what matters - or at least it shouldn't matter.

This show is unique - nothing else in the Unplugged series could match it and was a huge departure from other Nirvana live performances. Nirvana never conformed to anyone else's standards, and their MTV Unplugged performance is another example.  In the ""Bare Witness"" segment, MTV producers admit to being worried about how it would turn out because Nirvana didn't follow the show's formula for success.  They didn't play their best-known hits, they played a lot of cover tunes, they didn't invite a high-profile celebrity artist to be their guest performer and they didn't even do retakes - they just let it stand.

It's sad that such a peaceful, mellow, and talented era was replaced by a bunch of corporate lip syncing jokers. MTV barely even plays music anymore. Yeah, they had non-music stuff in the 1990's such as the rock and jock games, singled out with Jenny McCarthy, and Beavis and Butthead (but at least they had a music theme to them).

2989577,5,B000WQW988,"Thanks to the legal hijinks that dragged on long after Kurt Cobain's death, anything Nirvana-related was put on hold.  After the legal resolution a couple of years ago, a 3-cd set of unreleased recordings saw the light of day (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-The-Lights-Out/dp/B00065XJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With The Lights Out</a>), not to mention the obligatory ""best of"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nirvana/dp/B00006V9A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nirvana</a>).  Now finally comes the somewhat legendary ""MTV Unplugged"" show.  This set still draws some mixed reactions, even if most fans agree it's brilliant.  Taped just months before Cobain's suicide, it's both startingly raw and disturbingly planned, with the band playing amongst candles and flowers (stargazer lilies, to be precise)--more than a few people noted it seemed like a funeral, and indeed that's the way Cobain intended it.  Other details that stand out include the fact that while most of the band sit propped on wooden stools, Cobain sits in what appears to be a standard swiveling office chair (""I have very bad posture,"" indeed!) and the presence of ex-Germ (and future Foo Fighter) Pat Smear, who backs Cobain up as a second guitarist.  Anyway, for all its emblamatic status, ""Unplugged"" also gave a somewhat false impression of the band, and Cobain in particular.  Instead of the decidedly plugged in punk the band was known for, Cobain was transformed into a pained-looking, cardigan sweater wearing ghost warbling about how Jesus didn't want him for a sunbeam.  Another MTV broadcast, taped just a few months before ""Unplugged"" the suitably-named ""Live and Loud"" show, could restore the balance somewhat, but of course it hasn't been officially released on DVD yet.  Nevertheless, ""Unplugged"" retains an almost atavistic hold on the viewer, and is still one of the most intense musical performances ever broadcast on television.

Instead of a basic acoustic run-through of their hits, the band used the opportunity to put a new spin on some of their album tracks.  The songs ""Polly"" and ""Dumb"" were pretty much unplugged before, but in the context of this show became brillianty-etched character studies.  The main character, however, was always Cobain, and his songs constant references to death and alienation became all the more chilling here.  ""Unplugged"" is, therefore, something of an audiovisual suicide note.  No suicide note has been as exhilerating as this one, though.  If you never believed in the concept of catharsis, this might chance your mind.

The band also used the show to highlight some of their own favorite music, and five of the songs here are covers, all of them given new life by their inclusion here.  David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" now seems like Cobain speaking from his grave, even if he wasn't dead yet.  The tradional ballad ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam"" was performed by one of Cobain's favorite bands, The Vaselines, but this version was both tribute and personal statement.  Three songs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meat-Puppets-II/dp/B00000I9KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meat Puppets II</a>, with Chris and Kurt Kirkwood from that band joining in, also seemed handpicked for their metaphorical content, most notably the damnation-themed ""Lake of Fire.""

What makes this DVD more than just a keepsake is the fact that the entire performance, complete with between song banter and mistakes, are included, as well as the original broadcast version.  The uncut ""Unplugged"" also has 14 songs, compared with the broadcast version's 12.  Of course, all the songs can be found on the CD version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MTV-Unplugged-in-New-York/dp/B000003TB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MTV Unplugged in New York</a>), but now it's available in full 5.1 glory (and done remarkably well, I might add).  The long version also includes a very brief, abortive version of ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" done as ""the Brothers Meat"" (as Cobain says) were setting up.  While the retrospective documentary also included here is disapointinly light on information, it does include a short clip of Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo, who was at the taping.  So while this is pretty much essential for fans, even the curious will want to check this out.  Hopefully, some of Nirvana's electric performances will be released soon, but this is still a unique performance that easily transcends the era when it was done.",1196640000,146,4603,5.712609970674487

Wish they would have interviewed the guy from Sonic Youth, or something/someone more interesting; even Dave or Krist (probably impossible).  Still waiting all these years was worth it.

I've played this on my laptop, and in my DVD player at home with 5.1 surround, and it sounds great in both places.  MTV did a fantastic job putting this together.  Not only do you get the MTV broadcast, but you also get the entire show, without editing, from song to song, and it's really cool to see how Kurt was interacting with the crowd, Krist and Dave, and the guest musicians he had on the show.

The MTV News ""Bare Witness"" segment was really neat too.  You see people involved with the concert, whether it be fans or the MTV producers behind the scenes, and they lend some really valuable insight into that very special evening in NYC.

I think even if you are not a Nirvana fan or a Kurt Cobain fan (how can you not be a fan, though?), this DVD is a great purchase.  For $12, you cannot find a better value for what you get in terms of quality.  Also, this was the most historic concert of the 90's, as just a few months later, Cobain's life was ended.

2989582,5,B000WQW988,"I just got done with my review for DVDFanatic... This is an excellent release for many reasons. Here are excerpts from my review:

Finally we are able to see the entire unedited performance that took place on stage at Sony Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993. In addition to that, for the MTV-lovers out there, you get the original MTV broadcast performance and a few other goodies.

Though there is a small part of me that wishes there was a 16x9 presentation of this, but I am happier to have the originally shot and intended 4:3 Full Frame aspect ratio. It looks fine, but is noticably from the mid-`90s It may have restotred a little, but ahsn't really been refined or sharpened. Either way, still brighter and better than a VHS taped from TV in 1994!

Available are a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track, DTS 5.1 track and the original Dolby Digital Stereo. I found myself watching the MTV broadcast in Stereo, but pumping the DTS for the unedited set. The 5.1 mixes put you in the room with the band; the subtle roaring of this ""acoustic"" crowd surrounds you. And though there is a minor difference between the DD and DTS, it is basically negligable when the music is playing. They are both a mix well done.

An eight-page color booklet inside has more photos (some from the CD booklet) and a page with the show's setlist, players, DVD credits, etc.

Considering what this is (a mid-`90s TV special), they did a great job in presenting a comprehensive package to fans. Of course, one could argue that the entire performance is a bonus feature, but MTV and Geffen opt to consider the original MTV performance the bonus material instead - making the unedited performance the main feature. This is brilliant. In addition to that, you get an older MTV special and rehearsal footage. It's not a lot, but it is pretty much everything you could have asked for that has something to do with the event at hand. I really can't think of anything lacking here, except perhaps a commentary from Grohl and Novoselic. But who was going to seriously cross their fingers and hope for that.

 Original MTV Version (45:37) - The ever-so-familiar original broadcast, complete with logos, commercial breaks and song titles, is actually really great to watch every now and then for nostalgia purposes. Some songs were edited out of order and others were dropped altogether, but this broadcast version is the one that fans have burned into their memories. You can choose a song individually or ""Play All."" The same three audio tracks are available for this performance as are for the main feature.
 MTV News: Bare Witness (14:04) - This is a great retrospective from 1999 made up of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. Fans, MTV personnel, members of the media, fellow musicians, and more comment on the evening. The piece actually does a great job of putting the uniqueness and what made this evening so special into perspective. For some it will serve as a reminder; for others it will attempt to explain history. It's the best and most appropriate featurette that could have been included. Excellent.
 The Rehearsals (22:33) - In this area of the Bonus Features menu you will find five songs from the rehearsal to view. What's odd is that there is no ""Play All"" option and you have to select each song individually... or so it seems. Actually, if you select the first song, all others will play in order after it. The collection is absolutely fantastic behind-the-scenes footage of Cobain, just practicing and chatting with the band. It's great to watch and a much-appreciated addition to the set. Rehearsal performances include: ""Come As You Are,"" ""Polly,"" ""Plateau,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""The Man Who Sold the World.""

Nirvana: Unplugged in New York is a must own for fans. For the first time, you will see the full performance that took place that night, and you'll get to experience it in a great 5.1 surround mix. In addition, you get the original broadcast version, rehearsal footage and a nice featurette on the event. There is no better way to spend $12, so make room next to Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on the shelf and purchase immediately.",1195948800,8,4146,4.76183844011142
2989583,5,B000WQW988,"i watched this Thanksgiving night on a 57 inch high def tv in full DTS surround and above that its like watching a totally different show. i mean i grew up watching this unplugged concert and listening to it for years but never have i experienced anything like this. its completly unedited and uncut. the banter between songs is amazing. you really get an idea what the band members were really like and what it must have been like to actually be at this concert. the songs sound totally new due to the remastering and on the rehearsals you get an even better look at how the band worked as a whole. there are a lot of things i could go on about but i don't want to spoil it for anyone. but one of my favorite parts is the end when Kurt signs a few fans CD's. its almost like he knew they were there, among all the record label people it seems like he had a knack for finding the real fans.

i totally reccommend this DVD to a true nirvana fan, youll be glad you got it.",1195776000,3,970,4.105263157894737
2989584,5,B000WQW988,"Yes indeed...good things come to those who wait.  After being a purchaser of a VERY compromised ""copy"" of the broadcast version, ran off extensively from what seems to be on a boot-leg DVD machine, I am pleased to have finally ordered, the real-deal.  And...as a matter of fact...""order"" is all I have done so far...haven't even received the product yet...hence I still give it 5 Stars!  (Some things are just known in advance...due to it's longstanding critical acclaim & acceptance)

Next...and I'll only believe it, when I see it...the ""Industry-Machine"" must do what's been in the lurch for even ten years prior!  And that is to restore another ""First-Aired-On-MTV-Relic""...the ""UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY: LIVE FROM RED ROCKS, DENVER, CO"" from U2, onto DVD...the VHS being out of print, for seems to be forever and NEVER released on the DVD format...ever!  And PLEASE guys...include the actual song that the picture on the LP, Cassette, CD & VHS proudly sported...the shot of Bono on top of the stage's pillars, kneeling down, with flag pole in hand, and helicopter in background!  ""Electric Co."" was the cut...and MTV was the entity that aired it...and every official release has since ""obliterated"" it!

The industry FINALLY got things right with this Nirvana modern classic...so let's go back about another 10 years...and do the same with U2's RED ROCKS.",1195689600,,1357,5.053811659192825
2989585,5,B000WQW988,"Seriously...why did they wait so long??

It would have been nice to have had some of their other music videos added as extras with 5.1 sound, but this will work just fine.  Picture quality is great ans it sounds awesome.

Love the rehearsals.  Buy this!!!",1195603200,4,255,4.6

2989588,5,B000WQW988,"I got the DVD today!
I've been waiting for this DVD for 14yrs!
I saw Nirvana at the Omni in Atlanta, Nov,1993,
little over a week after they recorded Unplugged.
Why has the machine waited soooo long to release this???
This ""uncut"" version of Unplugged totally kicks butt!
Hopefully, someday, some exec they might get the idea
to put ALL of Nirvana's videos on DVD, then everyone
can throw away their crappy bootlegged copies (LISTEN UP DGC)
Dave and Kris, we love ya.
Kurt, we miss ya, R.I.P.",1195516800,2,492,4.6022727272727275
2989589,5,B000WQW988,"Maybe Kurt was just at the right place at the right time. Maybe he was a sloppy guitar player. But he was a good song writer and he was honest. Call it Nirvana. That's what it is.

I was 12, maybe 13 when I was first truly starting to love this band. Something spoke to me. After seeing the Unplugged performance on Much Music I had to own it on video. Finally today, 13 years later, I am.

Nirvana unplugged was to me then what it is to me now. An honest performance of a band at its best that spoke to a generation and more.

Call Cobain what you will. He is the Elvis and The Beatles of a later generation.

And just so you know, there hasn't been an artist in rock as big since.

To finally see the entire concert uncut in the pleasure of my own home is a blessing. As a bonus, you can view the original aired version. The rehearsals offer insight into how the night was played out. See why Kurt was worried about screwing up 'The Man Who Sold The World', and why 'PennyRoyal Tea' was a solo performance. See for yourself why Nirvana Unplugged is a testament of time.",1195516800,32,1071,4.1298076923076925
2989590,5,B000WQW988,"It's been 14 years, but Nirvana's legendary Unplugged performance is now on DVD.  The picture quality is excellent.  Same with the audio.  The rehearsals are a great bonus too.  I could talk about this show all day, but if you're reading this, you know how great the show is.

One thing I haven't heard mentioned:  The Bare Witness MTV2 thing is a new edit that is only 14 minute long.  The broadcast version without commercials is 22 minutes.  A lot of stuff mentioned during ""Where did you sleep Last Night?"" was pretty powerful.  It's all gone.  Some of it is now overlapped on the last song in the clip..  so now it's totally ot of context.  It's a nice little bonus feature.. But 8 minutes are missing and they don't tell us why.",1195516800,5,734,4.43609022556391

Nirvana gave us a collection of sonic masterpieces, while others remember them for the album NEVERMIND, it is this performance that will be remembered as their finest hour.  Tonight I finally got to see this show on VH1 along with a bare witness documentary of those who were there.

I pre-ordered the dvd a few days ago and even paid extra so it gets to me ASAP.

3223842,5,B000WQW988,"First of all, this show took place on my 21st birthday.  While I was not there, I remember being absolutely floored when I first saw this performance on MTV.  You have to remember, Nirvana had never played these songs acoustically before this -  they were grunge, loud, full of feedback.  Then they go and play this show.  It gave them such a new dynamic, a sign of things that could've come for Nirvana had they continued.  Not a dud in the whole show, every song is a classic, from their incredible interpretation of Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" to the show closer ""All Apologies"".

I have seen thousands of concerts by hundreds of bands, both live and on video (I'm a video DJ and collect live concert footage), and I would have to put this in as one of the top 5 shows by a single band ever.  Absolutely amazing....

Now when is Pearl Jam's Unplugged show going to come out?",1194566400,,886,4.386503067484663
3223843,5,B000WQW988,"Oh, it's about time they released this masterful unplugged set by Nirvana. It's been a travesty for too long that this wasn't available, but at least now the dream is coming true. The best unplugged set MTV ever did, in my humble opinion.",1194480000,,238,4.558139534883721
3223844,5,B000WQW988,"This performance cemented Nirvana's reputation as being more than just a band of the moment, it elevated Kurt Cobain to the pantheon of great musician/songwriters and convinced any naysayers that he truly was THE artist of his generation. Songs from Nevermind and In Utero like ""All Apologies"" and ""Something In The Way,"" stripped to their skeletal parts, revealed facets previously unnoticed, and a depth the studio versions failed to capture. Nirvana's Unplugged performance became the measuring stick against all other Unplugged performances, and nothing held a candle to it. It has become a moment in time for a generation, and it was no wonder that MTV replayed the performance ad infinitum when Kurt was found dead in his home several months later. It also happens to be the one performance that bears repeat viewing, which owes much to the careful orchestration of the set and song choices by Nirvana. From the start with a ""ABOUT A GIRL"" a song from the first Nirvana album, which Kurt states 'no one really knows this song,' to the cathartic final performance of ""WHERE DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT"" culminating in a primal scream, which still gives me chills when I see it.

I can't wait to see this again, and again...",1194393600,9,1225,4.889423076923077

I will forever be a fan of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.  PS.  no more ppl forking out $50 or more for a crappy bootleg, this is OFFICIAL BABY! WHOOHOO! (Below is the offical Press release)

LOS ANGELES, October 23, 2007 - Nearly 14 years to the day of the filming of Nirvana's landmark ""MTV Unplugged"" performance, that raw, revealing and emotionally gripping acoustic concert previously seen only on television will be available for the first time on DVD. Unplugged In New York (Geffen/MTV Networks/UMe) will be released on November 20, 2007 and will feature the complete, unedited 66-minute concert including ""Something In The Way"" and ""Oh Me"" not aired during the original 44-minute broadcast. Unplugged In New York also includes five previously unreleased rehearsal performances and MTV News interviews with the band and audience members.

Filmed November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios, the show first aired on MTV on December 14, 1993; just four months before the untimely passing of Kurt Cobain. Unplugged In New York DVD is now presented in both Dolby Stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound and includes both the shorter original broadcast version, and Nirvana's entire unedited performance. When released on CD in November 1994, MTV Unplugged In New York debuted #1, won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996 and was quickly certified five times platinum.

Favoring a selection of carefully chosen tracks over the band's hits, Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl perform acoustic versions of Nirvana's ""About A Girl,"" ""Come As You Are,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea,"" ""Dumb,"" ""Polly,"" ""On A Plain,"" ""Something In The Way"" and ""All Apologies."" Six other songs are covers that mined Nirvana's musical diversity and depth, from David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold The World"" and The Vaselines' version of ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam"" to the trad folk ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" associated with Leadbelly and the Meat Puppets' ""Plateau,"" ""Oh, Me"" and ""Lake Of Fire."" Meat Puppets singer-guitarist Curt Kirkwood and bassist brother Cris Kirkwood perform with Nirvana on those tracks. Also seen and heard throughout are Nirvana's touring guitarist Pat Smear, an original Germs member and the original and now recurrent guitarist of The Foo Fighters.

The DVD adds the MTV News ""Bare Witness"" feature of interviews with the band, the MTV production staff, and fans in the audience, plus the rehearsal footage for ""Come As You Are,"" ""Polly,"" ""Plateau,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""The Man Who Sold The World.""

3223932,5,B000WQW988,"Of all the Nirvana dvd's available, ""MTV Unplugged in New York"" is my absolute favorite.  I've been a Nirvana fan for over 20 years and love all their music.  I watched the original show when it aired on MTV in 1993 and couldn't wait for it to be released.  I purchased a cassette tape of
Nirvana ""Unplugged"" as soon as it hit the record stores.  I played that tape in my car until it was no longer functional.  I eventually replaced it with a cd for the same reason.  Again, I played the cd until it was all scratched up from constant listening.  I finally replaced the cd last year and decided to get the dvd so I could ""relive the 90's"" (when Nirvana was at the top of the charts).

I love Nirvana's acoustic versions of ""About a Girl"", ""Pennyroyal Tea"", ""Come As You Are"", and ""All Apologies"". I love their cover songs too. In fact, my favorite Nirvana track from this session is a Meat Puppets song called ""Oh Me"".  The entire performance, cover songs and all, is outstanding! I highly recommend this dvd to Nirvana fans.",1424563200,,1026,4.386243386243386

Despite the great premise, most of the unplugged specials aren't very good, this is really one of the few exceptions. This one seemed doomed from the beginning with Kurt Cobain being dope sick and uncooperative with the shows producers. He threatened not to play several times and the show only went on at the last possible minute. What resulted was probably one of their best live performances recorded for posterity in full color. They would play only 9 more shows before Cobain took his life 6 months after the recording of this concert.",1413590400,2,631,4.851851851851852

But now on to the other great things about this dvd first off its amazing in quality i unfortunately never got to see nirvana play a show since i was too young to before i kurt took his life unfortunately. If you're a huge nirvana fan this is definitely a must have for your collection. Its like seeing kurt live and you can see his emotions as he plays the songs its perfect. Almost makes you want to cry seeing his pin pointed pupils and his cashed eyes. Again this is a must buy as soon as you pop it in, well at least in the case of my xbox 360, it just starts playing from the beginning of the show as if you were there to actually see it yourself.

3223983,5,B000WQW988,"This great DVD shows the original uncut recording, with all of the commercial break pauses and other random chit chat, along with the original MTV broadcast (which didn't include ""Oh, Me"". It also has all of the looseness (not to mention an impromptu rendition of Sweet Home Alabama) that you don't get in the superbly-edited CD recording. The MTV broadcast, for example, edits out the story of the offer of Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000 (apparently the offer was only a tenth of that, but it's always more interesting to exaggerate a story), while both the MTV broadcast and the CD edit out Kurt's mispronunciation of David Geffen as David ""Gessen"". It also edits out the profanity, such as ""fart you all, this is the last song of the evening"" before the band goes into an insanely good ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night."" Funny, he pretends to smash a guitar at the end of the set, before walking off. Ah yes, Kurt - in those days he walked, he talked, he smoked, he gave autographs... he loved his wife and his daughter... then he blew his brains out and selfishly deprived all of us of himself and his songs. But hey, what did he owe us? How can one person just give and give and give and give...?

It's cool to see him so close, his glassy stare, his occasional smile, the way his jaw shifts in strange ways, how he seems to sing so effortlessly, how he hardly seems to move from his perch at the edge of his band, who sit so far behind him. Krist slack-jawes, Dave Grohl trying to be light-hearted, Pat Smear off to the side and looking a bit amused with it all... The biggest revelation of the DVD is the banter between the last two songs and a strange audience interaction when they request REM's ""Pretty Persuasion"" (?!?!), and one woman screams lustily ""RAPE ME!!!"" A shocked, yet devilish smile from Kurt here. ""I don't think MTV will let us play that.""

The DVD also has a weird ""interviews with"" a bunch of irrelevant people who were there or involved backstage. It's very different from the spirit of the show. There are also a few samples of the practice session, where we hear that Kurt's vocals are too low in ""Polly"", how his voice cracks already in ""Plateau"", not to mention how you get to see Curt Kirkwood singing along to his own songs (as we do in the main set). Wow.",1371254400,,2290,4.463007159904534

3223986,5,B000WQW988,"I think I missed the original broadcast of this in 1993, but I do remember frequently seeing clips of different songs aired as music videos.  Nirvana's Unplugged is not only the best edition of Unplugged, but one of the true great live performances.  As many other reviews have noted, the majority of the songs performed by Nirvana weren't particularly well-known songs by the band except for ""Come As You Are"" and ""Polly"", and several of the songs are actually covers of other artists' songs.  In fact, for years I thought ""The Man Who Sold the World"" was a Nirvana song.  Some of the best songs are covers of Meat Puppets songs, ""Plateau"" and ""Lake of Fire"".  This DVD is great, since it includes both the broadcast version and the original unaired version with all 14 songs.

3224004,5,B000WQW988,"Despite being a die hard NIRVANA fan; I never purchased this dvd because I had recorded it on SP mode (VHS) and it was in tremendous quality. Furthermore, I recorded it onto a DVD-R so I was extremely happy with the show. However, I thought about NIRVANA unplugged because of the 19th anniversary of the show and decided to impromptu buy it. ***IF you are a serious fan than this is a pre-requisite. I am so happy with the DVD for a myriad of reasons, which I will provide in thorough detail.

Okay, the main thing that I liked about the DVD was that it provided context to discrepancies between the CD, ""Unplugged in New York"" and the MTV performance. For example, the songs were not in the same sequential order. I knew that two songs had been omitted, but Dumb was track 6 on the CD and performed 4th on MTV. That always perplexed me. Why did that happen? What was I missing? If you ever felt the same I am going to begin answering these questions.

Well, first off I will detail what is actually on the DVD for an attention getter: The MTV performance as aired many times, rehearsals, a documentary on the event; entitled Bare Witness and The unedited performance from Nov. 18, 1993. (Really as if you were there in the audience.)

The MTV performance has been broadcast thousands of times, but in case you aren't a die hard fan I will detail the track listing. It is as follows:

1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. Dumb. 5. The man who sold the world. 6. Pennyroyal tea. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Plateau. 10. Lake of fire. 11. All Apologies. & 12. Where did you sleep last night?

The Rehearsals are really enlightening because some of the dialogue heard on the CD makes sense now. I would imagine NIRVANA rehearsed more than 20 minutes, but maybe not. The included Rehearsal set list is as follows:

1. Come as you are. 2. Polly. 3. Plateau. 4. Pennyroyal tea. 5. The man who sold the world.

The ""Bare Witness"" documentary aired on MTV back in 1999 and is approx. 15 minutes. I hated this documentary back then and feel comparable today.

& The unedited performance. The GEM. It not only included the missing two songs; Oh me and something in the way, but also qualifies a proper dialogue context.  The set list here is the same as the CD, but way better.  Having said that...the set list is as follows:

1. About a girl. 2. Come as you are. 3. Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam. 4. The man who sold the world. 5. Pennyroyal tea. 6. Dumb. 7. Polly. 8. On a plain. 9. Something in the way. 10. Plateau. 11. Oh me. 12. Lake of fire. 13. All apologies. 14. Where did you sleep last night?

Okay, I have laid out what is on the dvd; now I can finally give you some specificity to what I have been saying repeatedly about context. I'll break down the unedited performance and reference the MTV performance and rehearsals too.

Unplugged in New York opened with audience clapping. Well, on the unedited performance you see who this people are. You see the band come out on stage and sit down. Kurt opened up by saying ""Hello here."" This would lead to the intro of about a girl. There isn't much of a break before the band starts come as you are; similar to the MTV performance.

Next, Kurt Cobain introduces Lori Goldston, the cello player, and Dave Grohl acknowledges the new guitar player Pat Smear. People seem to forget that Smear was going to be a full fledge member of the band moving forward. It saddens me  that this fact is totally forsaken. For instance, he isn't even listed on NIRVANA's wikipedia page as a member. He is at the bottom as only a touring member. Kurt said, many times that Smear was going to help contribute on the next album. My point is he wasn't just an extra guy that appeared, for the first time, on Saturday Night Live in Sept. 1993. He was a legitimate member and on the unedited version of Unplugged; that point is conveyed albeit briefly.

Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam goes by just like it did on the MTV performance. Do you remember when Kurt said I guarantee you I will screw this song up? He was talking about The man who sold the world and this dvd explains why. Kurt was having problems with Pat's guitar, on the song intro, during the rehearsals. He appears moderately frustrated. I.e. in a constructive non condescending manor.  The song is terrific leading up to Pennyroyal tea.

I always wondered why Kurt asked am I going to do this by myself? Well, during the rehearsals the song really wasn't going well. Initially, they had Pat playing guitar and also singing backup. Scott Litt, the sound technician, suggests that Grohl play guitar and Smear focus on the backing vocals. This really didn't improve things and Kurt was playing the song in a different key too.

Therefore, Kurt asks am I going to do this song by myself? Another part that was edited out of the MTV performance...Grohl asks Smear Are you not going to sing? Then quickly he answers Kurt with do it by yourself. Kurt acknowledged that he was going to play in the normal key, by himself, and it is absolute BRILLIANCE. OUTSTANDING. 100 percent better than rehearsal.

Next, Kurt opines that we can't play dumb next. However, he quickly concludes that Unplugged is taped and MTV will edit it differently anyway. He would have to tune his guitar down to a D for on a plain. Thus, they decided to play dumb next. Afterwards, on the unedited version, Kurt says we can't play those two songs back-to-back because they are the same song.

There really isn't anything new with Polly in the performance. Kurt needed his vocals raised the rehearsals and Grohl sang out of key. However, on the unedited performance it came together perfectly again.

Again, On a plain is virtually the same as the MTV performance. Moreover, Something in the way is the exactly the same as heard on Unplugged in New York the cd. However, at the beginning of the unedited performance, Kurt asks Grohl to play a beat to help him keep time.

You always hear how raw NIRVANA was as a band, rightfully so, and that is on display after something in the way. They don't even have a set list authenticated. Moreover, there was no cue for the Meat Puppets to come on stage.

Kurt starts to drink tea after something in the way when someone may have told him to hurry up. This leads to Kurt and Krist Novoselic discussing an old show called Davie & Goliath. Kurt mentions that there was episode in particular that scared him as a boy. And, that it wasn't very Christian. What's next? Oh, we're supposed to play Meat Puppets songs. Right, Kurt asks?

The Meat Puppets come on stage very slowly. All in all there is about a 5 minute delay between songs. The banter is fantastic though. Kurt references Nine Inch Nails and a fan screams out for FREE BIRD. Kurt facetoiusly indicated that he was expecting somebody to say that.

Krist starts playing Sweet Home Alabama and Kurt rips into shreds with mocking vocals. The crowd laughs. I hate Lynard Skynard! I really enjoyed this part of the unedited performance obviously. What song is next is asked again. What are they tuning a harp? Kurt asked that on Unplugged in New York and it makes sense now because why is this taking so long?

NIRVANA runs through Plateau, Oh me, new in the Unedited version, and Lake of fire. Afterwards, Kurt plugs their cd. Thank you, Nirvana! You hear the Meat Puppets say that just like Unplugged in New York. What's next? Another delay. Extremely interesting though. Kurt asks any requests?

The crowd shouts out Sliver a few times. Krist plays a bit of the riff. You get a Marigold reference here. Next, Somebody says in bloom. Kurt is bewildered by that. ""How are we supposed to do In Bloom acoustically?"" This created quite the dichotomy because All apologies is next.

All apologies is always the footage shown of Kurt when talking about his suicide. He looks and feels depressed with the context of said clip. However, he is talking to the fan about In Bloom and actually starts the song, but Pat isn't ready. He looks back at Krist and Pat says I'm sorry. The song is started again. The point is he was in a good mood prior to the song beginning. It is quite the juxtaposition when considering the all apologies footage on documentaries and newsroom B-roll.

Grohl asks, after all apologies, why don't we do sliver? Kurt says, I don't think that would work well. Grohl agrees, thinking, yeah you have to scream on it. The subject of requests comes up again. D-7 is mentioned, but Kurt repudiates that by saying that isn't our song. The irony being they had performed covers all night. Kurt was actually who pointed that out. The crowd yells TEEN SPIRIT. Thankfully, the band didn't play it or even acknowledge the fan.

A female fan yells for Rape me and Grohl asks was that Kennedy? He is so Funny! Kennedy was an MTV VJ at the time.

I don't think MTV will let us play that one, Kurt said. This was a reference to the 1992 MTV VMAs. Ironically, NIRVANA was allowed to play Rape me on the Live N Loud special that air just one month later. Anyway....Krist starts telling the Led belly guitar story that you hear on Unplugged in New York. He tried to get David Geffen to buy it for him etc.

This leads to Where did you sleep last night? The song was spectacular and maybe a poignant send off for Kurt? Cliche. I am typing this at work. 4a.m. Just pondering. Bottom line it was great, but what happened after? The cd and MTV performance just end. I always wanted this rectified. You sort of get this on the unedited performance.

It gets conspicuously  quite in the room and Kurt begins to sign a few autographs. He hated to do that, but didn't seem disingenuous here. Krist is standing behind Kurt and appears to be getting ready to ask Kurt; well, what did you think of our performance? The unedited DVD fades here. I was disappointed by that because I wanted to see the ending in totality. Nevertheless, the unedited DVD is powerful. I highly recommend it, even if you have the MTV performance recorded like I did.

Lastly, that Bare Witness documentary is on the special features. Lewis Largent, VP to MTV Programming, kept saying things like what are these songs they are playing on Unplugged? He intimates that the covers were played here for the first time. That is absolutely false. NIRVANA was playing Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam in their 1991 set-list. Where did you sleep last night? had been played, electrically, too. Finally, Largent was like SPECIAL GUEST.. maybe Pearl Jam? No, not Pearl Jam. Forget the debated Kurt/Eddie Vedder personal feud. It is a fact that Kurt thought Pearl Jam's music was less than mediocre. Additionally, he thought they were made by a producer to exploit the Seattle sound. In another words, Pearl Jam exemplified the grunge trend that he resented.

Bare Witness also has a few fans talking about being there. It just seems pretentious to me. I.e  Perhaps, those ""fans"" didn't even attend the show to begin with. The documentary is salvaged, I guess, with a good interview of Alex Coletti. He was the Unplugged producer at that time. Nothing new was added. It is the exact same piece that aired on MTV, I still have on VHS, in fall 1999.

Seeing Nirvana, seeing Kurt performing on a tape for more than 3-4 minutes (one song) - was not something I experienced ever in my life. This DVD left me completely speechless and made my heartbeat stop just to capture a a simple moment, like one of my greatest wishes came through.

This is Kurt singing with his deepest emotions, with the saddest look on his face and the best, the best performance Nirvana ever did. It's also worthy to say that is not only completely amazing to see Kurt sing, but also it is very agonizing (at least for me) to see Kurt in this light.

The group's work is just as good in electric mode as it is in acoustic format, and sometimes even better - as much as I love ""Come As You Are"", ""About a Girl"" and ""On a Plain"" in their studio versions, I think they even get better in an acoustic setting. Plus where else are you gonna find treasures like the Meat Puppets set (those Kirkwood brothers can PLAY!), the totally screwed-up version of ""Pennyroyal Tea"", where he totally flubs the lyrics, their brilliant covers of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" (which I think is better than Bowie's original), the Vaselines' ""Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam"", with a great accordion (NOT an oxymoron, by the way), and one of my favorite Nirvana tunes, ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"", which has some CREEPY screaming at the end. Not to mention that version of ""All Apologies""... even redundant, already acoustic tunes like ""Dumb"", ""Polly"", and ""Something in the Way"" are still amazing.
Of course, you can get all that on the CD, but here's some reason to buy the DVD. For one, the between-song banter is expanded upon, and unlike the usual between-song banter (which usually consists of the whole ""Are you ready to ROCK? I can't hear you, over all the ROCK! Show me your SOUL, San Fransisco!""), is really funny. I especially like the little jokes they make at Lynyrd Skynyrd's expense when the Meat Puppet guys come on (nothing against Skynyrd, I just find that mumbled joke run-through of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" funny, and the puns about ""Free Bird"" funnier). Plus the set - the candles and flowers - looks cool. And it's funny to hear the ridiculous songs people shout for near the coda.
This review wasn't very coherent, I know, but hey. I love this stuff so much, I can't even talk about it without turning into a rambling fanboy. Just buy it. If you like the band, you won't be disappointed.",1207267200,2,1953,4.598853868194842

3224036,5,B000WQW988,"There are two kinds of people you can't listen to: the ones who refer to Kurt Cobain by his first name, and the ones who say Nirvana was just power cords. I'm neither.

I was already a big fan of the Unplugged CD, but I'd never seen the MTV broadcast. I bought this DVD hoping for a good show. It far exceeded my expectations.

Kurt Cobain was dead years before I ever even heard of Nirvana. I got to know Nirvana through their audio. I avoided media coverage and other people's opinions on Kurt Cobain, because I can't stand celebrity worship or misguided fascination with his suicide. The man was incredibly talented. He made great music. He put his soul into his music. He cared about his work. Those are the nicest things I can say about almost any stranger.

Anyway, the concert is great. The band knew MTV would edit the show for broadcast, and  it's relaxed, unhurried, and unaffected. The Unplugged album is a great showcase for Cobain's voice, and this show is even better. Neither the man nor his lips move much. He doesn't seem to be trying. In other words, he seems sincere. The band is infinitely more interesting to watch than any fan boy ever led me to believe. It felt good, to see this for myself. I can wear a Nirvana T-shirt now.

Cobain also seems high. He was addicted to heroin around the time this was recorded so... maybe.

Most importantly, the music is great. Better than ever. The songs felt better than new.",1202860800,,1435,4.478927203065134

3224041,5,B000WQW988,"It's been fifteen years since this show aired on MTV. Since then, the accompanying CD has become a staple with most fans of the band, while the show itself became a distant memory. On one hand, it just doesn't feel like fifteen years have passed since then; the music still sounds fresh, vital and contemporary. On the other hand, my son barely knew how to walk when this was filmed, and now he's applying for a driver's license. I guess perspective is everything. In its time, the most jarring aspect of this performance rested in how well these songs worked in an acoustic environment. Here was this intense, electrified, post-punk indie band playing at James Taylor volumes. Kurt Cobain remains seated throughout, while Dave Grohl plays his drums with a deft touch, using brushes. Against all expectations, the show rocked in ways that nobody could have predicted, and finally, the evidence is available on DVD for all to see.
 So many of these songs are classics in their own right, but many have been surpassed by the specific versions featured in this program. ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam,"" ""The Man Who Sold the World,"" ""All Apologies"" and ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"" represent some of the best music that our culture had to offer, and what held true in '93 still holds true today. This performance seemed simple and charming in its time, but has grown to represent so much more. Watching this, it is impossible to not mourn the loss of Kurt Cobain. What he could have achieved is incalculable, but there is so much evidence here pointing to the raw and crucial nature of his artistic creativity. We are so much worse off without him than we tend to acknowledge. Considering that he passed away within six months of this show, it now takes on the airs of a eulogy, an impression that is heightened by the candles and flowers that adorn the stage.
 On a technical note, this DVD contains the unedited performance, including songs that did not appear on the original MTV broadcast. For purists and impatient types, it also contains the edited version as aired by MTV. The extra tracks and between-song banter only add to the casual brilliance of this performance, and the recording is so crystal clear that you can hear the texture of Grohl's brushes on the cymbals. As rock and roll films go, this is classic, like footage from Woodstock, or Altamont. It seemed so simple at the time, but nothing like it has appeared since then. An entire generation has now come of age that never had the opportunity to see Nirvana, and specifically this show. Now that I've watched it a few times, I know what I must do. I need to give this to my son. before he leaves for college.

There ""Unplugged"" taping showed that they were not only a band that could play loud and with conviction but could express there point of view in a softer, acoustic form.  This performance truly shows the range of a band that was the poster childs for the ""grunge"" movement but expressed them in a way that shows how this band was much more than just a grunge band.  With Kurt Cobain's telling lyrics and the conhesiveness of it's members Nirvana will go down in history as one of the great bands.  This performance DVD shows why.",1200528000,,606,4.532110091743119
3224046,5,B000WQW988,"I had listened to Nirvana's most well known tracks back in the early 90s, and I knew of the circumstances surrounding Kurt's death. But - since I had not taken serious notice of Kurt and Nirvana early on, I didn't fully realize why some people on the radio were so vocally mournful of his passing.

Then in late 2006, my then 13 year-old son got me reinterested in grunge music and Nirvana at a deeper level. We were stuck in slow car ride during a snowstorm with only a Nirvana CD in the car. I listened to several tracks I hadn't heard before, either because I was a tuned out baby-boomer and/or they didn't receive the airplay. Following up, I listened to a lot more and it was a musical reawakening.

I later bought the unplugged DVD as an early holiday present for my son, and it ended up being a present for both of us. I actually kept it after our first watching - and viewed it late at night while I was doing some laptop work. In summary - watching this video makes you wish Kurt could be resurrected. This is a truly great live performance! It's like being in the living room with a relaxed, yet well-rehearsed and enormously creative artist.

Biggest pluses - the unplugged version of ""All Apologies"" is even better than the already great studio version. Great collaboration with the Meat Puppets - especially ""Lake of Fire."" Kurt's take on Leadbelly's ""Where Did you Sleep Last Night"" is riveting. There was a good measure of low-key but effective humor and side comments.

This performance was humble yet visually interesting to watch. They did not need to ""put on a show"" to move their audience. To Nirvana's credit, this performance was actually the antithesis of stagemanship. And that is because the stagemanship was not necessary.

My only regret is that they didn't include an unplugged version of ""Heart Shaped Box"" in this collection. For that, you need to pick up the ""Wishkah"" CD (or download the MP3). The Wishkah is a river near Kurt's native Aberdeen WA. This information I gained from a recent film ""About a Son,"" which is an exceptionally well-done retospective documentary.

I agree with Tom Petty in regard to a comment he made about Nirvana being ""the most significant band since the Beatles."" Kurt Cobain was a truly amazing talent - and it ended far too soon.",1200528000,,2292,4.6330049261083746

It shows him and the band in the most raw footage ever. Every facial expression, every word, every comment... its just Kurt through and through. I nearly cried, and believe me I'm not one to show emotion. But, for a moment it felt as if he was still alive I guess... I always wished I could have met him or gone to one of his concerts. And now with this dvd I can experience the true Nirvana experience anytime I want. There is nothing I could say that would in anyway be a critic of this dvd. It is Nirvana in its perfection.

If it wasn't enough there's the 2 channel version which is far superior to the original CD.

Picture quality it's quite good for a 14 plus year old broadcast performance, seeing this concert it was hard to believe for me that unfortunately Kurt is dead and Nirvana doesn't exist anymore, specially because it feels like it was filmed yesterday, image is polished, crisp and bright as it should be.

This acoustic performance is among Nirvana's best. The power of Kurt's voice is breathtaking. This performance proves that Nirvana was one of the greatest and most talented bands ever. The best performance, in my opinion, is ""Pennyroyal Tea"". Kurt does this song all by himself and it showcases the true talent that he possessed. This is such a great concert because it was performed in front of a very small audience and in an intimate setting. Very nicely done. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves Nirvana.

The visual and sound qualities are excellent, the extras add a bit more for your dollar but the actual performance footage is more than enough. The DVD contains the entire recorded performance except for Sweet Home Alabama which I don't believe the band plays completely in any case. For people who know Nirvana only as a rock band and Kurt Cobain as the more often than not raving singer/guitarist, his performance will stun you ear drums with the beautiful sounds his voice shows when singing in a different style and format. All of the musicians, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl (drummer, now lead singer guitarist of Foo Fighters)display a dexterity in musical style that I really enjoyed. The slower pace & different key of the music played here allows you to hear the lyrics better, and the instruments more individually played. The solos by Kurt are sometimes heartbreaking  when heard in the hindsight of his untimely death. Oh Me, a Meat Puppet  cover, Something in the Way, Pennyroyal Tea, and Dumb, are particularly poignant. About A Girl, Come As You Are, All Apologies, Polly are equally excellent. There isn't a song on here I didn't like. It's said Kurt was under the influence at the time, or indulged afterwards with serious consequences--whatever the tongue-waggers wanted to make of it, he & the band put in an excellent, professional performance irregardless of any extenuating circumstances.",1198713600,,1523,5.015810276679842

Nirvana never conformed to anyone else's standards, and their MTV Unplugged performance is another example.  In the ""Bare Witness"" segment, MTV producers admit to being worried about how it would turn out because Nirvana didn't follow the show's formula for success.  They didn't play their best-known hits, they played a lot of cover tunes, they didn't invite a high-profile celebrity artist to be their guest performer and they didn't even do retakes - they just let it stand.

After the legal resolution a couple of years ago, a 3-cd set of unreleased recordings saw the light of day (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-The-Lights-Out/dp/B00065XJ4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With The Lights Out</a>), not to mention the obligatory ""best of"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nirvana/dp/B00006V9A0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nirvana</a>).  Now finally comes the somewhat legendary ""MTV Unplugged"" show.  This set still draws some mixed reactions, even if most fans agree it's brilliant.  Taped just months before Cobain's suicide, it's both startingly raw and disturbingly planned, with the band playing amongst candles and flowers (stargazer lilies, to be precise)--more than a few people noted it seemed like a funeral, and indeed that's the way Cobain intended it.  Other details that stand out include the fact that while most of the band sit propped on wooden stools, Cobain sits in what appears to be a standard swiveling office chair (""I have very bad posture,"" indeed!) and the presence of ex-Germ (and future Foo Fighter) Pat Smear, who backs Cobain up as a second guitarist.  Anyway, for all its emblamatic status, ""Unplugged"" also gave a somewhat false impression of the band, and Cobain in particular.  Instead of the decidedly plugged in punk the band was known for, Cobain was transformed into a pained-looking, cardigan sweater wearing ghost warbling about how Jesus didn't want him for a sunbeam.  Another MTV broadcast, taped just a few months before ""Unplugged"" the suitably-named ""Live and Loud"" show, could restore the balance somewhat, but of course it hasn't been officially released on DVD yet.  Nevertheless, ""Unplugged"" retains an almost atavistic hold on the viewer, and is still one of the most intense musical performances ever broadcast on television.

Instead of a basic acoustic run-through of their hits, the band used the opportunity to put a new spin on some of their album tracks.  The songs ""Polly"" and ""Dumb"" were pretty much unplugged before, but in the context of this show became brillianty-etched character studies.  The main character, however, was always Cobain, and his songs constant references to death and alienation became all the more chilling here.  ""Unplugged"" is, therefore, something of an audiovisual suicide note.  No suicide note has been as exhilerating as this one, though.  If you never believed in the concept of catharsis, this might chance your mind.

The band also used the show to highlight some of their own favorite music, and five of the songs here are covers, all of them given new life by their inclusion here.  David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"" now seems like Cobain speaking from his grave, even if he wasn't dead yet.  The tradional ballad ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam"" was performed by one of Cobain's favorite bands, The Vaselines, but this version was both tribute and personal statement.  Three songs from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meat-Puppets-II/dp/B00000I9KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meat Puppets II</a>, with Chris and Kurt Kirkwood from that band joining in, also seemed handpicked for their metaphorical content, most notably the damnation-themed ""Lake of Fire.""

What makes this DVD more than just a keepsake is the fact that the entire performance, complete with between song banter and mistakes, are included, as well as the original broadcast version.  The uncut ""Unplugged"" also has 14 songs, compared with the broadcast version's 12.  Of course, all the songs can be found on the CD version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MTV-Unplugged-in-New-York/dp/B000003TB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MTV Unplugged in New York</a>), but now it's available in full 5.1 glory (and done remarkably well, I might add).  The long version also includes a very brief, abortive version of ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" done as ""the Brothers Meat"" (as Cobain says) were setting up.  While the retrospective documentary also included here is disapointinly light on information, it does include a short clip of Sonic Youth's Lee Renaldo, who was at the taping.  So while this is pretty much essential for fans, even the curious will want to check this out.  Hopefully, some of Nirvana's electric performances will be released soon, but this is still a unique performance that easily transcends the era when it was done.",1196640000,146,4603,5.712609970674487
3224075,5,B000WQW988,"Get this DVD now!  The quality (to me) is amazing.  The extras of the band rehearsing is so awesome and watching it over and over reminds me how much i love and miss them.  There's a behind the scenes interview of people who were there and the kid in the hat was pretty dull.  Wish they would have interviewed the guy from Sonic Youth, or something/someone more interesting; even Dave or Krist (probably impossible).  Still waiting all these years was worth it.  The extra songs and the banter between songs are priceless and I'm so happy there was an opportunity and now a DVD that captured Kurt's amazing talent.",1196553600,,614,4.587155963302752
3224076,5,B000WQW988,"This DVD is great! The sound is amazing (DTS) and the picture quality is just as good. And yes, there are subtitles. I don't know what that other guy was talking about.",1196208000,,168,4.28125
3224077,5,B000WQW988,"This is absolutely the best music DVD I've ever seen.  Picture quality is great, and (obviously) more importantly, the sound is incredible.  I've played this on my laptop, and in my DVD player at home with 5.1 surround, and it sounds great in both places.  MTV did a fantastic job putting this together.  Not only do you get the MTV broadcast, but you also get the entire show, without editing, from song to song, and it's really cool to see how Kurt was interacting with the crowd, Krist and Dave, and the guest musicians he had on the show.

The MTV News ""Bare Witness"" segment was really neat too.  You see people involved with the concert, whether it be fans or the MTV producers behind the scenes, and they lend some really valuable insight into that very special evening in NYC.

I think even if you are not a Nirvana fan or a Kurt Cobain fan (how can you not be a fan, though?), this DVD is a great purchase.  For $12, you cannot find a better value for what you get in terms of quality.  Also, this was the most historic concert of the 90's, as just a few months later, Cobain's life was ended.  This intimate look into that special night that so few shared with the band is really worthwhile.",1196208000,3,1201,4.345291479820628
3224078,5,B000WQW988,This is a great dvd with an outstanding performance by Kurt Cobain. Great sound quality and the picture was good as well. You won't regret purchasing this flawless performance on dvd for the first time.,1196035200,2,202,4.8
3224079,5,B000WQW988,"I just got done with my review for DVDFanatic... This is an excellent release for many reasons. Here are excerpts from my review:

Finally we are able to see the entire unedited performance that took place on stage at Sony Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993. In addition to that, for the MTV-lovers out there, you get the original MTV broadcast performance and a few other goodies.

Though there is a small part of me that wishes there was a 16x9 presentation of this, but I am happier to have the originally shot and intended 4:3 Full Frame aspect ratio. It looks fine, but is noticably from the mid-`90s It may have restotred a little, but ahsn't really been refined or sharpened. Either way, still brighter and better than a VHS taped from TV in 1994!

Available are a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track, DTS 5.1 track and the original Dolby Digital Stereo. I found myself watching the MTV broadcast in Stereo, but pumping the DTS for the unedited set. The 5.1 mixes put you in the room with the band; the subtle roaring of this ""acoustic"" crowd surrounds you. And though there is a minor difference between the DD and DTS, it is basically negligable when the music is playing. They are both a mix well done.

An eight-page color booklet inside has more photos (some from the CD booklet) and a page with the show's setlist, players, DVD credits, etc.

Considering what this is (a mid-`90s TV special), they did a great job in presenting a comprehensive package to fans. Of course, one could argue that the entire performance is a bonus feature, but MTV and Geffen opt to consider the original MTV performance the bonus material instead - making the unedited performance the main feature. This is brilliant. In addition to that, you get an older MTV special and rehearsal footage. It's not a lot, but it is pretty much everything you could have asked for that has something to do with the event at hand. I really can't think of anything lacking here, except perhaps a commentary from Grohl and Novoselic. But who was going to seriously cross their fingers and hope for that.

 Original MTV Version (45:37) - The ever-so-familiar original broadcast, complete with logos, commercial breaks and song titles, is actually really great to watch every now and then for nostalgia purposes. Some songs were edited out of order and others were dropped altogether, but this broadcast version is the one that fans have burned into their memories. You can choose a song individually or ""Play All."" The same three audio tracks are available for this performance as are for the main feature.
 MTV News: Bare Witness (14:04) - This is a great retrospective from 1999 made up of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. Fans, MTV personnel, members of the media, fellow musicians, and more comment on the evening. The piece actually does a great job of putting the uniqueness and what made this evening so special into perspective. For some it will serve as a reminder; for others it will attempt to explain history. It's the best and most appropriate featurette that could have been included. Excellent.
 The Rehearsals (22:33) - In this area of the Bonus Features menu you will find five songs from the rehearsal to view. What's odd is that there is no ""Play All"" option and you have to select each song individually... or so it seems. Actually, if you select the first song, all others will play in order after it. The collection is absolutely fantastic behind-the-scenes footage of Cobain, just practicing and chatting with the band. It's great to watch and a much-appreciated addition to the set. Rehearsal performances include: ""Come As You Are,"" ""Polly,"" ""Plateau,"" ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""The Man Who Sold the World.""

Nirvana: Unplugged in New York is a must own for fans. For the first time, you will see the full performance that took place that night, and you'll get to experience it in a great 5.1 surround mix. In addition, you get the original broadcast version, rehearsal footage and a nice featurette on the event. There is no better way to spend $12, so make room next to Live! Tonight! Sold Out! on the shelf and purchase immediately.",1195948800,8,4146,4.76183844011142
3224080,5,B000WQW988,"i watched this Thanksgiving night on a 57 inch high def tv in full DTS surround and above that its like watching a totally different show. i mean i grew up watching this unplugged concert and listening to it for years but never have i experienced anything like this. its completly unedited and uncut. the banter between songs is amazing. you really get an idea what the band members were really like and what it must have been like to actually be at this concert. the songs sound totally new due to the remastering and on the rehearsals you get an even better look at how the band worked as a whole. there are a lot of things i could go on about but i don't want to spoil it for anyone. but one of my favorite parts is the end when Kurt signs a few fans CD's. its almost like he knew they were there, among all the record label people it seems like he had a knack for finding the real fans.

i totally reccommend this DVD to a true nirvana fan, youll be glad you got it.",1195776000,3,970,4.105263157894737
3224081,5,B000WQW988,"Yes indeed...good things come to those who wait.  After being a purchaser of a VERY compromised ""copy"" of the broadcast version, ran off extensively from what seems to be on a boot-leg DVD machine, I am pleased to have finally ordered, the real-deal.  And...as a matter of fact...""order"" is all I have done so far...haven't even received the product yet...hence I still give it 5 Stars!  (Some things are just known in advance...due to it's longstanding critical acclaim & acceptance)

Next...and I'll only believe it, when I see it...the ""Industry-Machine"" must do what's been in the lurch for even ten years prior!  And that is to restore another ""First-Aired-On-MTV-Relic""...the ""UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY: LIVE FROM RED ROCKS, DENVER, CO"" from U2, onto DVD...the VHS being out of print, for seems to be forever and NEVER released on the DVD format...ever!  And PLEASE guys...include the actual song that the picture on the LP, Cassette, CD & VHS proudly sported...the shot of Bono on top of the stage's pillars, kneeling down, with flag pole in hand, and helicopter in background!  ""Electric Co."" was the cut...and MTV was the entity that aired it...and every official release has since ""obliterated"" it!

The industry FINALLY got things right with this Nirvana modern classic...so let's go back about another 10 years...and do the same with U2's RED ROCKS.",1195689600,,1357,5.053811659192825
3224082,5,B000WQW988,"Seriously...why did they wait so long??

It would have been nice to have had some of their other music videos added as extras with 5.1 sound, but this will work just fine.  Picture quality is great ans it sounds awesome.

Love the rehearsals.  Buy this!!!",1195603200,4,255,4.6

I've been waiting for this DVD for 14yrs!
I saw Nirvana at the Omni in Atlanta, Nov,1993,
little over a week after they recorded Unplugged.
Why has the machine waited soooo long to release this???
This ""uncut"" version of Unplugged totally kicks butt!
Hopefully, someday, some exec they might get the idea
to put ALL of Nirvana's videos on DVD, then everyone
can throw away their crappy bootlegged copies (LISTEN UP DGC)

Kurt, we miss ya, R.I.P.",1195516800,2,492,4.6022727272727275
3224086,5,B000WQW988,"Maybe Kurt was just at the right place at the right time. Maybe he was a sloppy guitar player. But he was a good song writer and he was honest. Call it Nirvana. That's what it is.

I was 12, maybe 13 when I was first truly starting to love this band. Something spoke to me. After seeing the Unplugged performance on Much Music I had to own it on video. Finally today, 13 years later, I am.

Nirvana unplugged was to me then what it is to me now. An honest performance of a band at its best that spoke to a generation and more.

Call Cobain what you will. He is the Elvis and The Beatles of a later generation.

And just so you know, there hasn't been an artist in rock as big since.

To finally see the entire concert uncut in the pleasure of my own home is a blessing. As a bonus, you can view the original aired version. The rehearsals offer insight into how the night was played out. See why Kurt was worried about screwing up 'The Man Who Sold The World', and why 'PennyRoyal Tea' was a solo performance. See for yourself why Nirvana Unplugged is a testament of time.",1195516800,32,1071,4.1298076923076925

One thing I haven't heard mentioned:  The Bare Witness MTV2 thing is a new edit that is only 14 minute long.  The broadcast version without commercials is 22 minutes.  A lot of stuff mentioned during ""Where did you sleep Last Night?"" was pretty powerful.  It's all gone.  Some of it is now overlapped on the last song in the clip..  so now it's totally ot of context.  It's a nice little bonus feature..
