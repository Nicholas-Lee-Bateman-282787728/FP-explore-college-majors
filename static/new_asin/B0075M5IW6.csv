8510610,5,B0075M5IW6,"Liked the moral to this story. It has humor and some tears and some anger and well deserved indignation. Mostly it has a story of how the person who would love us most is often over looked because of appearance. Maybe too short, too heavy, teeth a little crooked, what ever. We are so prejudice in how we think we should choose a partner we forget to look at the person's heart. Very nice story and of course the cast is just the best ever!",1375747200,,440,4.188235294117647
