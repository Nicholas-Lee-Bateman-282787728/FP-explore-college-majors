4933308,5,B0062P2N5C,"This is a great ski video, could use snowboarders to be even better, but if you are a skier you are going to love this video. It is awe inspiring, and very artistic. We play this in our medical office for the patients to watch.",1336262400,,227,4.066666666666666
4933309,1,B0062P2N5C,"If you are into getting preached to about the evils of Global Warming and climate change this is your brainwashing dream.

The beginning of the movie has some decent non-ski cinematography. Wait, where is the snow?

There is some decent pow, but the shots are all cut up in some lame attempt at art. Clean smooth ski shots are generally better than splicing ten different lines together semi out of order.

Then 2/3 of the way through the skiing stops and it goes to full guilt trip you are ruining the world, climate change is the most important thing in ski movies crap.

Wait, I thought I ordered a ski movie?

Save your money, or better yet, get the new MSP movie Attack of La Nina, that movie is sick.

Pros:
There is one sick section with some of the deepest pow ever.

Cons:
The movie is a downer.
Soundtrack might be ok, but the lame voice overs...

Final verdict? I want a refund.",1333929600,2,889,4.378048780487805
4933310,5,B0062P2N5C,"I typically watch 2-3 ski movies a year, MSP, TGR, Poor Boyz, the usual. This is a very special movie, the best 2011/2012 movie in my view. Not as good as Steep, still my favorite, but good. My only concern, I am afraid that for next year everybody will try to copy this, and then it will get boring pretty quickly.",1331683200,2,315,4.180327868852459
4933311,1,B0062P2N5C,"I felt like I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the skiing to kick into high gear...and then the movie ended.  Does not compare to a TGR, MSP or other major ski movie producer film, there quite simply just is not enough skiing. Save your money.",1325721600,,250,4.319148936170213
4933312,5,B0062P2N5C,"Definitely one of the most innovatively filmed ski movies ever. These guys (mostly, a few gals show up)throw some wicked air and take really sick lines down incredibly steep terrain mostly accessed either by skinning to it or taking a chopper. Pretty good soundtrack too.

There is not really a story or if there is it wasn't something I could follow and the action seemed to jump from place to place without the film telling you, but, hey, it is a freakin' ski movie. It has lots of big mountains and deep snow. And, the filming techniques used are cutting edge.

Check it out to get your ski brain and body super-charged!",1325635200,7,623,4.553571428571429
4933313,1,B0062P2N5C,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie, as it was high on half-baked skier metaphysics on life and global warming and very thin on actual skiing.  For every brief scene of skiing, the audience is forced to muddle through environmental-awareness oriented shots (which are, admittedly, very nicely shot) and embarrassing voice-overs by the athletes.  If you buy ski movies to see limit-pushing skiing that amazes you and gets you excited to get on the mountain, then absolutely do not buy this movie.",1324771200,2,502,5.109756097560975
4933314,4,B0062P2N5C,I thought this movie was only about sports but it's so much more.,1427328000,,65,4.076923076923077

4933320,5,B0062P2N5C,"Only one other ski movie compares to All. I.Can - Blizzard of Ahhhhs!  These two are the best, and then there's all the rest.",1392163200,,125,4.208333333333333
4933321,5,B0062P2N5C,"This film is so well done, instead of one section that pops, they kept the quality up all the way through.  This film has taken ski films into a new, higher quality territory.",1390435200,,175,4.303030303030303
4933322,4,B0062P2N5C,"More than just a travel log of fortunate skiers. This film has a message that should resonate with all outdoor enthusiasts, and not to mention that the cinematography is breathtaking and extremely well done.",1389916800,,207,5.117647058823529
4933323,5,B0062P2N5C,"We LOVE Sherpas Cinema films!! They capture a true art and essence that hasn't been showcased in this nature before. They blow our minds every time, keep us dancing to the killer soundtracks, and will keep us coming back for more! An absolute MUST SEE! Also see Into the Mind; their newest release!",1388620800,,298,4.6415094339622645

4933325,5,B0062P2N5C,This is the Ultimate Ski movie.  Lots of great cinematography and it was awesome getting to skiing all over the world (like Morocco- who would have thought?).,1365552000,,158,4.851851851851852
4933326,5,B0062P2N5C,"Words really can't express the love I have for this film. Extraordinary in pretty much every way, and it goes far beyond just a skiing documentary. I highly recommend the Blu-ray to take full advantage of the cinematographers eye!",1363564800,,230,4.923076923076923
4933327,4,B0062P2N5C,"I bought this based on some clips and trailers about the movie.  I loved the cinematic time-lapse of nature and the blending of summer and winter shots of the same location.  However, some of the scenes were cut short without finishing the segment for some reason and that detracted from the next segment.  The skiing shots were done well and the landscape was beautiful.  I had no issue with the global change segments since I knew they were part of the movie up front.  But I felt they could have done more with interviewing the skiers and such.  This is a decent movie and I understand it was a cinematic view of skiing and also what we're doing to the environment, but I definitely would recommend Warren Miller films over this one if you want an action-filled skiing movie.",1363046400,,778,4.561151079136691
4933328,5,B0062P2N5C,"Defininely one of the best ski or snowboard movies out there.  I've been skiing for the past 23 years, with a decent portion spent doing competitive racing and freeriding and this one is easily the most inspiring and important.",1360800000,,227,4.82051282051282
4933329,5,B0062P2N5C,"I don't understand why the other reviewers have to give bad ratings simply because there is an environmental subtext to this film.  As they say in the film, by being out on the mountain we are all inherently environmentalists.

Griefers aside, this film is simply amazing.  I've watched it with skiers and non-skiers and everyone is blow away on so many levels, the skiing, the scenery, the cinematography, the context, the music.  Its all so enjoyable.  I've owned it for a few weeks and have shared it with so many people.  I can't imagine many people who wouldn't thoroughly enjoy this film.  Can't wait to see what Sherpas Cinemas comes out with next.  Okay, I'm going to go watch it again now!",1360454400,2,698,4.663934426229508

The artistic and technical cinematography is superb.
A friend shared it with me and I had to own it.

Buy one and pass it on...you will like this film even if you have never  been on skis or a board.",1360108800,,282,4.109090909090909
4933331,5,B0062P2N5C,This is one of the best ski movies as far as the cinematography and epic shots! definitely does not disappoint,1359331200,,110,4.55
4933332,5,B0062P2N5C,Well produced movie that will interest the non skier and snow nut alike.  I live in South Africa so DON't ski.  Saw a clip at the Banff film festival and bought the movie. Some stunning scenery and locations.  Love the crisp look of white powder on a clear day!,1357689600,,261,4.285714285714286
4933333,5,B0062P2N5C,"Not your typical ski porn film. It IS ski porn, but so much more: Knock your socks off innovative cinematography, mind boggling concepts, gorgeous art direction, and a message that if you really truly love skiing, you have to understand that your passion is inextricably interlinked with the health of our planet.

This film has won so many awards it's insane, both inside the ski industry and in equal competition with the major blockbusters.",1353974400,,443,4.986486486486487

8491353,4,B0062P2N5C,"I'm not into snowboarding, but when I saw the 10min preview of this film I had to check it out. The editing, the shots, everything goes together so flawlessly. Honestly there's so many beautiful moments in the film it's surreal. I've now purchased ""The Art of Flight"" and I'm much more likely to watch winter sports! If you want a peek into the dreams of a die hard snowboarder, check this out.",1483833600,,394,4.486111111111111

8491356,5,B0062P2N5C,The cinematography of this movie is on another level. Not just a shot of some skier doing something big. Each shot is incredibly well-planned and artistic. A must-watch if you're into film.,1476921600,,189,4.9375

Just go pick up a copy and support those people that put there lives on the line to make this dangerous film. OK?",1433289600,,286,3.629032258064516
