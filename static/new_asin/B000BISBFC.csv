8087022,5,B000BISBFC,"I ordered this DVD just to see Jamaa Fanaka's (RIP)  flick ""Street Wars"".... an early 90's gangsta flick set in Los Angeles. I enjoyed the film and really only watched just to see Bryan O'Dell who plays the drug kingpin/older brother. Great actor. Wish he had been in more films.",1424822400,,279,4.58
8087023,3,B000BISBFC,"warriors of the wasteland: completely amazing as far as ""what the HELL did i just see"" cinema from italy.  i watch terrible movies with groups for the last 5 & it's one of the best i've ever shown.  it has a great twist at the end that you'd never expect.

blood tide: james earl jones plays a bigoted chauvinist who accidentally releases some creature that we only see for about 30 seconds of the entire movie.  NOTHING interesting happens for the first 45 minutes.  total snooze fest.  one neat thing is that the sensei from the karate kid stars in this, wasn't sure who he was at first but i knew his face.

street wars: zero sci-fi.  this was obviously filmed to cash in on the gang movie crazy of the early 90s and did what can only be described as a bizarre job.  sugarpop, a kid straight out of an annapolis prep school, goes home for the summer (by riding his jet powered moped, no less) to find his neighborhood has turned into a crack wonderland.  lots of goofy moments, a bunch of shootouts and posturing by an openly gay thug go by until his brother is shot down.  inheriting his brother's top spot in the cartel, as well as millions of dollars, he decides to turn the cartel around and do good things.  the last part of the movie shows them trying to take out drug lords by flying ultralights and doing strafing runs and dropping home made bombs.  the police sort of take the stance of ""we'll let this thing sort itself out, they're just black."", which is absolutely amazing.  i think there's a statement trying to be made in this movie, and i think it's ""we shouldn't have made a movie, but we did and there's crack in it.""

i'm rambling and incoherent, but that's probably a result from watching these 3 movies back to back.",1317686400,,1739,4.390625
