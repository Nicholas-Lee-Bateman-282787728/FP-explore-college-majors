2423370,4,B000BL02FG,"First let me say that I have years of experience in various martial arts, mostly both Chinese & Japanese.
My focus & forte is self-defense with joint locks & Dim-Mak/Kyusho-Jitsu that is effective with efficient movements.
This DVD & the companion book are very good & someone with experience & focus can get a lot out of them both.
I find the Qi Gong very useful & well done.
My main complaint is about the woman that demonstrates the first long sequence. She dances well, but I can't see why she was chosen to demonstrate the form. Maybe her ballet like movements would translate better into combat than I give her credit for, but I am doubtful(sorry).
And, truth be told, I am probably too critical of her movements.
 Other than that, you can always learn so much from great masters such as Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming & Master Shou-Yu Liang.",1210032000,8,838,4.586666666666667
2423371,4,B000BL02FG,"Definetely presents a lot of material with excellent application footage. A bit misleading, however, in that the majority of forms are presented by people other than Master Liang Shou-yu. Master Liang, whose skill is clearly very high, is shown demonstrating applications and single movements of the form but it's difficult to piece together the energy of his movements into a connected whole as the flavor is quite different from the young lady demonstrating the continuous sequence.

  The DVD, is however, definetely worth the price provided you are willing to watch it in slow motion several hundred times as the movements are quite complex.

  I would recommend it to anyone with a background in internal martial arts or access to a teacher of this particular style. I would not recommend it to someone without experience in any of the internal styles or at least some basic Qi Gong under a qualified teacher as unfamiliarity with relaxation and correct joint alignment could lead to some serious discomfort and possible injury in attempting these forms.",1181088000,17,1059,5.127906976744186
2423372,5,B000BL02FG,"Make no mistake, this killer DVD is the source for comprehensive info on the art of Pau Kua. It contains the complete 3-volume video series done by the two masters, with easy navigation. Includes everything from Qigong, solo and partner conditioning training demonstrated by Yang and Laing, solo and partner forms, to the martial applications, and weapons. Amazing. To get into the esoteric depths of the subject, pick up the companion book to this DVD and read the ancient texts. Awesome.",1146614400,19,489,5.049382716049383

8088480,5,B000BL02FG,"This is one of Mr. Liang and Dr. Yang's older joint efforts, but it still remains a really solid resource on Baguazhang.  Baguazhang, though a relatively ""modern"" art (originating largely in the 19th century), has a surprising amount of variation and numerous traditions.  This video does a very good job of providing an overview of the forms and methods of Mr. Liang's specific lineage as well as offering some basic excercises that can benefit any turning palms practice. The teaching and explanation is divided well in both the video and the accompanying book with Mr. Liang providing the demonstration in teaching in his Emei Baguzhang tradition and Dr. Yang providing instruction in qigong methods as translation of traditional documents. I found the updated DVD (which combines all of the old VHS videos) to be well edited and menued.  I found the revised edition of the book to be layed out more clearly and with better type face.  Although I don't practice Mr. Liang's style specifically, I enjoy watching this presentation  over and over again. In particular the demonstration of the ""Deer Hook Swords"" which are so famous in the tradition.",1447372800,,1149,5.026315789473684

8088484,3,B000BL02FG,"Liang Shou Yu is a good martial artist from the mainland and a very dedicated practitioner of the arts. His main expertise is Shuai Jiao (Chinese wrestling) which is evident in his Bagua. (Nothing wrong with that, it just shows what flavor he has.) There is a lot of information in this book and overall it deserves a higher score but the amount of information is actually the problem. Not enough in-depth information is given about the basic elements. It's nice to see the elk horn knives but to include a partner set in a book that also teaches basics for this complex system is like trying to please everyone at the same time. The conditioning exercises are mostly from Shuai Jiao and they are fine but it shows the attempt to cover everything. As a survey this is fine but there just is not enough strong instruction on the essentials of Bagua. This is a coulda: it ""coulda"" been a great book.",1319414400,,897,4.50920245398773
8088485,3,B000BL02FG,"This video was created by Master Liang Shou Yu and Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. Even though this dvd was published by YMAA I feel that it falls short of YMAA's standard of excellence. The main reason for this is that even though Dr. Yang is in the DVD the primary focus is Master Liang and his style of baguazhang. As with Master Liang's other videos I felt the demonstrations lacked any sort of power or intensity. I was also dissapointed by the lack of historical information that is usually present on Dr. Yang's DVDs. If you practice Master Liang's style of baguazhang this DVD may be of use to you; if not I would advise giving this one a miss.",1304726400,3,642,4.4033613445378155
8088486,5,B000BL02FG,"This DVD along with the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baguazhang-Theory-and-Applications/dp/1594391130/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baguazhang: Theory and Applications</a>&nbsp;offers the most comprehensive background and coverage of Bagua Zhang.

In the DVD there are several demonstrations to match book.
And the DVD has rare demonstrations of 2 person form, and deer horn knives form.
And even rarer demonstrations of applications with deer knives against swords and staffs.
You will want to make sure that you buy the book with this to explain the forms.

The demonstrations in the book are done in the classical Chinese style of teaching.
The technique is performed at normal speed, and then performed again twice at a slower speed.
During the performance there are not any instructions either vocally or with sub text.
However, there is nice oriental type flute music playing.
And I would guess that this method would work well if you had a teacher present to correct your mistakes.
Or if you were or had learned this particular style and wanted something as a refresher or a prompt for your memory this would be great.
In any case it does have several good examples of Bagua Zhang forms and applications.

Bagua emphasizes circular movement, employs both defensive and offensive strategies, and trains mainly in the near and middle ranges of distance.

The DVD is separated into 3 parts:

* Section 1 contains basic training and body conditioning, teaches Bagua Qigong, and demonstrates the foundation basic Eight Palms sequence with martial applications.

* Section 2 instructs the intermediate level Bagua Swimming Body sequence, named for the swift and agile movements of a swimming dragon, with martial applications.

* Section 3 presents the unusual Bagua Deer Hook knife. Covered are hooking, seizing, controlling and cutting techniques, and the complete sequence, with applications against the long staff and sword.

I personally found the forms difficult to learn from this DVD, however I really liked it as a resource and as a great reference.  (I did learn a Bagua form from Ted Mancuso's DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bagua-The-Art-of-Change/dp/B000S5RRQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bagua: The Art of Change</a>&nbsp;)
From my experience I recommend this as a reference and as a way to expose one's self to a variety of Bagua Zhang forms.
And as a way to broaden one's exposure to different Bagua styles and techniques.

And I absolutely recommend getting the book of the same title to go along with this as the book has a lot of explanations and more detail. The two are closely tied together.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baguazhang-Theory-and-Applications/dp/1594391130/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baguazhang: Theory and Applications</a>

The quality of the DVD its self is very good.  You can tell that it was made by a professional crew.",1298851200,5,3002,5.875862068965517
8088487,5,B000BL02FG,"This video is full of Bagua from very basic to very advanced. It is a response to the modern attitude of I want, what I want, when I want it. The nice thing about this video is that it has distinct sections for various levels of ability. Please see the print screen images of the menu at the top of this page.

Basics include individual palms, stances, stepping.
Advanced qigong development, pole training (pushing / hitting a post) and partner exercises and forms.
Forms demonstration consists of the Basic eight palms and applications, Swimming body palms and applications, Dear Hook Swords and applications. 1st option of watching the forms is one section at a time (8 sections per form) playing twice at slow speed and then switching to normal speed then to applications. 2nd option is the Complete form slow. 3rd option is the Complete form normal speed.

Recommendations for using this video most effectively.
1st Watch everything on the video.
2nd Decide your level of Bagua (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).
3rd Chose a section appropriate to your level in the slow option and follow along.
4th Form training, 1 section at a time slow until comfortable.
5th Form training Complete Sequence slow.

Development time. Please keep in mind our bodies require time and regular exercise to develop. As we are working out with these videos our bodies are gradually becoming stronger, more flexible, and more coordinated.

Example: I purchased this video because I wanted to learn the Swimming Body Palm form (form 2 on the video). Some of these moves are very new to me, so I had to watch the form slow 3 times just to figure out what was going on. We're talking 360 or more degree spins with the palms sometimes turning horizontally while he is stepping to keep up with the linear traversing movement, and other times the palms are swinging in a vertical circle while spinning on one foot in the same spot and the palms are so coordinated that they all are striking downward onto the same spot in rapid succession.

Realizing the potential benefit of this kind of training I am just going slow, watching how he steps, spins, and how he moves his palms. I was quite awkward at first. Now I can almost follow along with the complete sequence in slow mode.

Compromise: I must admit I have to make some compromises in the following ways. First my training area is much smaller than the one in the video so my sliding step is much shorter. Second, my legs are not as limber, so I do not yet crouch as low as this instructor. Third, my mid section is not quite as dragon-ish as this instructor so it may be awhile before I can lean to one side and turn simultaneously.  Having said that, I am still safely determined to learn this form.

Book Baguazhang -Theory and Application: I had this fascinating companion book awhile back and gave it to a friend. So I re-ordered it mainly because it has the secret songs or poems of Bagua. Ancients passed on knowledge by creating short songs or poems to be used as keys for remembering and understanding the art. The video is a stand-alone instructional tool, so you do not need the book to learn the forms and improve your body.

However, at a later date you may consider purchasing the book to improve your mind and understanding of the art. It seems that when one writes a book, there is a lot of thinking and analyzing the topic from different perspectives that gets put into the book. Here is an excerpt from the book. Secret Songs of Attacking. Page 123. Hands: Grabbing, striking, seizing, and controlling, use both hands. It is real (Gongfu) when the feet and the hands both arrive together. The fist is like the cannon shape, the body bends like a dragon. The hand like chopping the mountain and rush forward.",1291420800,15,3755,4.65158371040724
8088488,1,B000BL02FG,"It's like paying for a lesson in how to use a knife, and all you get is two hours of watching someone eat steak.

The demonstrations have some value.  If you are a masochist, you could spend years figuring bagua out from the demonstrations.  For this value, I might give it two or three stars.  However, for $80, I wish I could give it zero stars.",1280016000,6,347,4.212121212121212
