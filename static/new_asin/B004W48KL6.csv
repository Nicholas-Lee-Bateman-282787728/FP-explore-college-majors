4485251,5,B004W48KL6,Veggie Tales videos are loved by my children. They do a consistently good job of reinforcing the moral lessons we share with them. Good parenting and these videos make a good 1-2 punch.,1355529600,,185,4.636363636363637
4485252,4,B004W48KL6,"I love Veggietales. I've been hooked since I was 8, and now my 3 year old loves them too!

These three stories are very good ones. I love having them on one dvd, so I don't have to change discs to put on a new one.

My only qualm was that I didn't realize the video was only a compilation of stories, not the entirety of each of the videos these stories are in. If you're looking to have a complete Veggietales collection at some point, buy each of these videos individually. The full video version of Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush has a story about Junior asparagus facing bullies as well, and the full video version of Sheerluck Holmes has a story about the ""Asparagus of La Mancha,""  both of which are not here. This is half of each of those movies, and the full-length version of Tomato Sawyer and Huckleberry Larry.

That said, if you're looking for wonderful Veggietales stories as we all know them, this is great. Just don't use this to add those three movies to your Veggietales collection.

Oh, and it may be noteworthy to point out you can't select subtitles on this video. I wanted to figure out the lyrics to a song in Sheerluck Holmes, but they sang fast and there are no subtitles here. Can't even find the lyrics online. I guess I'll just have to listen closely!",1334534400,7,1300,4.422594142259414
