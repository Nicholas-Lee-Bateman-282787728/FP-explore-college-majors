8156139,2,B000KF0DV6,"I am a ski instructor and bought this video with the hopes of adding to my bag of tricks for teaching.  I found this video to be way out of date and based on European skiing styles of the 1990's.  Even though the instructor was on shaped skis, he was still teaching the straight ski methods.",1264982400,,291,4.178571428571429
8156140,5,B000KF0DV6,"I just started to ski and I advanced so quickly because of Martin Heckelman's DVDs.  If you want to learn this DVD is a must.  Really.

If you have never been on skis, start with Ski tips 1 along with this DVD.  I spoke with the author of this DVD, Martin Heckelman, and he suggests to get Ski Trips 5: Ski Carving after this DVD to get to a more advanced place.

Good Luck.  Once you look at these DVDs you will be so happy that you got them.",1233100800,,443,3.9213483146067416
