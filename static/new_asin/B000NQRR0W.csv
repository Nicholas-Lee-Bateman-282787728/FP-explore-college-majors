2778919,4,B000NQRR0W,"Below I will list some basic pros and cons about the film.

Pros:
- Historical video clips mixed with reenactment scenes: It is a very nice blend. Of course there is a strange contrast between the quality of the footage from older historical clips and the more modern reenactment. However, this blending is definitely a pro because it gives a sense of the authentic nature of the true-story narrative, along side with the enjoyable action-packed reenactment.

- Excellent incorporation of world events and history: Although the main focus of the video is to describe the actual activities of the Navy Seals, the video also does a great job of giving background information on the events that were happening in the world which shaped these missions. It is very educational and informative in that respect.

- Narration: The speaker is very clear and sounds like he might be a military-trained individual. His voice and manner of speaking is a nice addition to the presentation.

- Very suspenseful: It seems that the makers of the video took some liberty to ""dramatize"" the story by making it very suspenseful. I'm sure the actual true-stories had an element of suspense, but this video probably embellishes the suspense. I suppose this could be considered positive or negative (positive because it makes the video more entertaining, or negative because it probably strays from or exaggerates the true-story). I am choosing to consider this a positive feature of the film because it probably doesn't compromise the true-story too much and it definitely adds an enjoyable touch.

Cons:
- Made for TV: It seems the video was made for TV, not DVD. This is apparent from the fact that every 15min or so, the video suddenly recaps on the events that were already shown earlier. Sometimes it's rather confusing because you will be following the chronological flow of the story and all of a sudden without warning, the narrator makes a statement describing events that were earlier in the video. This happens every 15min or so. It seems that the video was made for TV and that these sudden interruptions that summarize the previous events are included to reorient a viewer after an interruption due to advertisements. Of course, there are no advertisements in this video, so it seems confusing when these summary statements are made all of a sudden every 15min. for no reason.

- Awkward special effects: It seems the special effects are very low budget. For example, it seems that fire and explosions were super-imposed over buildings and boats to give the illusion that that they are blowing up or burning. The effects look rather fake. However, the video is not meant to be a high-dollar action movie with top-notch special effects and pyrotechnics. It is more of a documentary. So as long as the viewer can tolerate this and has reasonable expectations, then it shouldn't be a problem.

Overall, I was very impressed with the video. I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who enjoys learning about Navy Seals missions.",1340064000,5,3018,4.952569169960475

2778945,2,B000NQRR0W,"This walks the line between reenactment and documentary badly.  The reenactment itself is uneven and often BAD.  It looks like cheesy 80's stuff, and more than once the SEALS run away from an ANIMATED .GIF EXPLOSION!

This should have been a documentary.  It could have been great, with some maps or other information to flesh out the narration about what's happening... but instead you are stuck with cheap, bad reenactment.  It just looks so cheap, and the actors are terrible.  Sometimes it almost seems like there isn't a script.  Once the leader briefs his team and says, ""Gentlemen, we are ghosts on this mission, gentlemen.  Gentlemen, during this mission..."" --and I was thinking, ""Did he really mean to keep saying 'gentlemen?'  That can't be in the script, he must be freestyling and trying to sound like a Tom Clancy game.""  In another instance, they keep talking up Manuel Noriega's 'gunship' boat that will turn the tide of the Panama invasion... and end up showing a small municipal harbor patrol boat.  I am guessing there is no way in hell Noriega had a $14,000 crumby boat, but this DVD is so low-budget, they didn't even try.  And it was therefore anticlimactic to have SEALS strapping a ton of C4 to... a tiny commercial boat.

I watched this in the background while I was doing other things but it still managed to bore me.  There is better SEAL or military stuff out there.",1402099200,,1394,4.730290456431535
2778946,5,B000NQRR0W,A must see video for all fans of the Navy Seals and Spec Ops forces.  You get a lot for your money with this video collection.  Highly recommend this product and vendor.,1401753600,,169,4.25
2778947,2,B000NQRR0W,"This is not a documentary. It is 3 dramatic reenactments (Panama, Somalia, Grenada). I knew I was in trouble when I heard the music playing when the DVD main menu loaded. Maybe it's okay as a Navy Seals recruiting video. Check it out on youtube before buying/renting it; look for ""SEALs: Untold Stories- Under Heavy Fire"".
