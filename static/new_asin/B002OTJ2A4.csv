8376413,3,B002OTJ2A4,"The Returning (1983), also known as ""Witch Doctor"", is made for the 80's Native American Indian Burial Ground horror crowd (The Shining (1980), Poltergeist (1982), Amityville II: The Possession (1982), Scalps (1983), Pet Sematary (1989)) with some extremely unpleasant acting and immensely ludicrous screen writing.

If you've ever believed in shamans, Native American Indian magic or Native American Indian supernatural powers, you will no longer continue to do so after watching The Returning.

The special effects (flaming stones that infrequently ""burn"") supposedly depicting a shamanic battle between the ancient spirits of two Indian shaman magicians, are so obviously contrived and improbable, you can only explode in scorn; if you're fortuitous, you'll puke, as I did.

The film is also a good example of the limitations of film-viewing, because I found the movie problematic (not a major problem alone), poorly acted, and tiresome for a so-called horror movie.

The movie is not great fun, nor do not look at it as a serious Native American Indian horror film, but it's still worth a look.",1289520000,,1098,5.329479768786127
