8225354,3,B000WR3Q0W,"As previous reviewers have mentioned, ""Belfast: The Sad Reality"" is a 39-minute guided tour of Belfast that was entirely filmed with a hand-held camera, which indeed gives this video a somewhat ""amateur"" feel that is possibly the video's most interesting feature and its most irritating element.

The narrator, one Martin von Merkom, is a competent if extremely biased tour guide. His commentary, which can be quite interesting at times, is often marred by frequent (and unnecessary) reiterations of previously made points as well as a noticeable speech impediment that can occasionally be a bit distracting. He also starts nearly every sentence with ""the sad reality is..."", which quickly goes from being annoying to becoming almost amusing, albeit in a not-really-funny kind of way. The last part of the video, which shows Mr. von Merkom in his vehicle discussing William of Orange and Orangeism, as well as what he believes would be the easiest way to achieve lasting peace in Northern Ireland, is arguably the most interesting segment of this tour. It is somewhat ironic that Mr. von Merkom should point out, time and time again, the bigotry of the Loyalist community (an opinion whose validity I am not questioning at all), only to turn right around and indulge in a heavy dose of prejudiced talk himself, using words such as ""ignorant"", ""animals"" and other such unflattering (and fairly gratuitous) terms to describe Loyalists. In spite of all his shortcomings as a narrator, Mr. von Merkom still provides viewers with a unique, man-on-the-street view of Belfast and of the Troubles, which makes this video worth watching if you are truly interested in this period of Northern Irish history and don't mind the absolute lack of objectivity in the commentary.

The filming style used for this video can only be described as ""amateurish"" at best, and ""motion-sickness inducing"" at worst; either words apply perfectly in any case, and the result does not translate into an entirely enjoyable watching experience, especially when the camera tilts a full 90 degrees for several seconds. Quite awful.

Overall, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone but the most hardcore Northern Irish history enthusiast. However, if you are that interested in the history of Northern Ireland and the Troubles, then this video is a worthy addition to what is probably already an extensive video collection on the subject.",1259366400,,2407,5.135204081632653
8225355,3,B000WR3Q0W,"First off, the film is only 39 minutes long and it more like someone's home video than it is an actual film.  I was hoping at least for a more documentary style but that's not what you get.  Most of the filming is done through a car window with the driver doing all the talking and pointing out areas of interest such as the many murals, the wall and memorials.  There is a bit of a history lesson but I've read plenty of books to know all of this.  There are no subtitles either to help you with the accent and I found myself having to go back two or three times to make sure I understood what was said.  It certainly is a unique look but I was hoping for so much more than a 39 minute tour of Belfast.  The producers should have sat down with the taxi driver and interviewed him a bit and others as well.  It is worth looking at especially the murals if you've never seen them before.",1254096000,,886,4.057471264367816
8225356,4,B000WR3Q0W,"A very informitive documentary, although very one sided. I am from belfast and grew up with the problems there and have witnessed first hand what took place over 30years of conflict. This DVD tells of a lot of the tragic events, but those events didn't just happen to the Catholic population. Worth watching.",1227916800,,308,4.830188679245283
