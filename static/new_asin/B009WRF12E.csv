8544700,5,B009WRF12E,"Anything that Dr. Joel Fuhrman write, speaks about  or records on disc is worth while.  If you follow his advice you will lose the
risk of cancer, heart attack, diabetes & stroke and be very active into your 90's.  He shows you how to build up your immune system so
disease can't get in.  No more flu, colds, allergies.  The US government has been providing it's citizens the wrong information regard to diet for 100 years. You should get a look at this guy's food science info, just for the sake of knowing what's wrong with our food  system & the health system it
turns it's back on.  Once you hear Dr. Fuhrman, when you stand in the check-out line at the grocery store, you will be shocked  at the big percentage of people who buy  food that does nothing  for their bodies & actually is putting them at risk daily for major disease in mid-life & old age.  He always says on his DVD's at the end,  ""Tell someone"".  He's sincere. He wants disease gone.  Our health system is going to be the demise of this country whether we have Obamacare or private health care.  It's scarey learning this info. But if everyone keeps their head in the sand, the outcome is very bad. The country can't afford hundreds of  millions  quadruple bypass heart surgeries, &  stroke & diabetes costs. We could have none of those diseases...not one.  This doctor doesn't  care how you learn.  He doesn't need the money.  He is a rich man. He wants to change the health of all Americans.  That's what he's about.  (Not to mention his recipes are terrific)  Think about this:  If you eat no flour & no sugar , go extremely light or also give up  white potato, rice, &  boxed cereal, you won't have to diet to lose weight.  You lose whether you want to or not. All your health problems will end. Imagine!( I should point out....  Actually the US has changed the food pyramid . Go look at it online 50 years ago and then today's version.  Most people haven't noticed  the change. Still it's not perfect yet)",1421193600,4,1980,4.413888888888889
