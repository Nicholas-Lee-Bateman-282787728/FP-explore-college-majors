4180900,5,B003R9IELI,"A BIG fan of Camilingieri, I was thrilled to get the episodes of Montalbano's adventures. The very best thing is that our detective is cast so perfectly that no one else could ever play the role...it's better than the books--isn't that saying something?",1306454400,13,253,4.906976744186046
4180901,5,B003R9IELI,"Since Andrea Camilleri isn't cranking out his Inspector Montalbano mysteries for me fast enough I've turned to the Italian DVD series to get my visual fix. First of all, let me be upfront: I'm a big fan of the book series so what you're getting here is fan blast with little scouring but a lot of pleasing 'ah's' at the texture of the finished product.
  With episodes 4 thru 6 you get The Terracotta Dog, The Artist's Touch and A Trip to Tindari. You also get fast paced dialogue with the same running pace subtitles and a true retelling of Camilleri's works. More so, you get an excellent cast that literally fit the bill. Actor Luca Zingaretti epitomizes Montalbano as do Cesare Bocci, Katharina Bohn, Peppino Mazzotta, Angelo Russo and the others that round out the wonderful cast.
  The Sicilian settings grab your visual attention as do the portrayals by the cast offering up another way to take in the satisfying storylines.
  Like I said I'm a fan but even if this series was my first introduction to Camilleri I'd be out scrambling to find the others. It's that good.",1290211200,46,1076,4.636842105263158

4180943,5,B003R9IELI,"DETECTIVE MONTALBANO is like pasta. No matter how much you eat, you always want more. Luckily, this TV show is not only delicious...it's good for you, offering nutrition not only for the mind and the wit, but for the eyes and the soul.

For those unfamiliar with this superb mystery-comedy-drama series produced over many years by Rai Television, DETECTIVE MONTALBANO follows the life of Salvo Montalbano (Luca Zingaretti) a wily, quirky, quarrelsome, food-addicted Sicilian cop who is police chief in the small but far from sleepy seaside Sicilian village of Vigata. Backing up Salvo, and quite frequently fighting with him (this is Sicily, after all) are his long-suffering, long-distance girlfriend Livia, sultry and (mostly) platonic friend Ingrid, hot-tempered and perpetually amorous second-in-command/best friend Mimi Augello, bumbling but loveable aide Catarella, gentlemanly sleuth Fazio, trigger-happy Galuzzo, indolent CSI tech Jacomuzzi, and of course the irritable pathologist Dr. Pasquale. Together they are half-family, half-colleague, and all entertaining. This DVD set includes three episodes: ""The Mystery of the Terracotta Dog"", ""The Artist's Touch"" and ""A Trip to Tindari.""

MYSTERY - Montalbano has his hands full, and then some, juggling a Mafia don who wants to defect and a 50 year-old double murder committed during the final days of Italy's involvement in WW2.  But while digging up the past is touchy stuff, playing the Mafia is dangerous business, and a mistake by Mimi Augello turn Montalbano from hunter into hunted, with tragic consequences.

ARTIST - A wealthy but crippled goldsmith commits an almost ritualistic suicide in his wheelchair, but when his will is determined to be a forgery, his estranged brother becomes the prime suspect in his murder. Montalbano's investigation unearths a love triangle, an old family quarrel, and an elaborate plot centering on that oldest of Sicilian motivations: revenge.

TINDARI - A notorious womanizer is shot dead on his own doorstep. An elderly couple disappears on an excursion to the resort town of Tindari. Is there a connection between these two seemingly unrelated incidents? Before you can say ""mingia!"" Montalbano is dealing with an aging Mafia boss speaking in riddles, a young Mafia hood on the run from the law, and a lot of home-made pornography which may be the clue to solving it all.

I hesitated whether to give this package 4 or 5 stars because I didn't feel ""The Artist's Touch"" was quite in the league with the other two. However, ""Terracotta"" is so damned good it is almost painful -- a mingling of Sicilian history with a Romeo & Juliet style love story, slippery Mafia intrigue, and some brutally violent action. As for ""Tindari"", it is the most nakedly sexual and at the same time, most diabolical of all the MONTALBANO storylines, showing both the grisly depths of barbarism to which the Mafia sinks as well as one of the funniest sequences in the history of the show, when Montalbano tries to kick down a door that proves to be somewhat tougher than he is. As always, the episodes spend much time exploring Montalbano's complex sense of honor as well as his relationships with such people as Mimi and Ingrid, but the best thing about MONTALBANO is not the plotting -- which can at times be convoluted and sluggish by American standards -- but the superb writing (adapted for TV from the novels of Andrea Camilleri), the wonderful chemistry between the actors, and the exploration of Sicilian life and culture -- a life of food, family, argument, corruption, humor, violence, sensuality and intrigue. That, and Luca Zingaretti, who is just a joy to watch, and brings to the screen the same mix of genius, idiosyncratic irascibility and off-kilter sex appeal that Jeremy Brett did to the amazing Granada TV SHERLOCK HOLMES series of the 1980s/90s. Montalbano loves a mystery, but what he really hates is the idea that someone can play him, and as a general rule, it's not wise to try. Though it is fun to see!

These episodes (in Italian with English subtitles) are presented in 16:9 anamorphic, and total up at 312 minutes, or about an hour and three quarters each. So sit back, open a bottle of wine, and get ready to feast your brain on some of the finest TV around...from Sicily, with love.

I do enjoy the series. The stories are interesting, as is the main character, and it is enriched as we get to know other players as well. I thought the subtitles ( the series is in Italian) would be a distraction, but after the first few minutes, one hardly noticed it.
The location scenery in Sicily is lovely, and In a visit to the island  this summer, I found a definite Montalbano cult, especially in Ragusa!

Montalbano and his modern Sicily feel very fresh -- it is not burdened or preoccupied with mafia rubbish, but neither does it deny their presence.  Be warned:  1) the series is addictive, 2) your reading speed may need to improve, 3) you will wish you understood Italian.  Why did i say travel?  Because I drifted from the Midsomer Murders (UK), to Maigret (both the subtitled original French and the nearly silly UK remakes), and now I'm off to Montalbano and Sicily.

4180991,5,B003R9IELI,"We are introduced to Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vig&agrave;ta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Scilly. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness,decay and at times murder.

He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim&igrave; Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal,including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer, so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front.
Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!
In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.

The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.

My only minor gripe was the extras seemed too `light', and I also thought there would have been more episodes on the discs.

If you like detective stories then this series are not to be missed",1333065600,6,2297,4.822335025380711
4180992,5,B003R9IELI,"You're lucky in the USA to have so many of the Montalbano episodes available. In Britain we are only just beginning to catch up. When I discovered Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano novels, I felt as though I'd stumbled across a gold mine. I'm hard to please when it comes to fictional detectives, but for me these books are up there alongside such greats as Raymond Chandler's first four novels or Dashiell Hammett's ""The Dain Curse"". And now we have the TV version, which I rate as highly as John Thaw's Inspector Morse or Jeremy Brett's first few TV series as Sherlock Holmes.

You can't help but compare Montalbano and Morse. Both have the quirkiness of the hero; both have humour; and both have beautiful backdrops, in the shape of Sicily and Oxford.  The difference for me is that with Montalbano I love the books AND the TV version, whereas with Morse I love the TV version but I'm not keen on the books.

The character of our flawed hero Montalbano has been adapted well for the screen, although we obviously don't get inside his head as much as we can in the books, and the TV version portrays him as a younger man. Montalbano is selfish and odd, but endearing and amusing - even more so in the books than on the screen. Here is a man who will avoid meeting his girlfriend so that he can savour a good meal in his favourite restaurant without having to talk to anyone. Of course every writer tries to create a detective who is in some way ""different"" or quirky, or has an interesting relationship with his sidekick, but the Montalbano creation really works and is very refreshing.

The humour, too, is an important element in both the TV version and the books. Camilleri thankfully does not rely on the currently predominant crime story formula of shock, gore and serial killers. There are gruesome murders, certainly, but the prevailing tone in Montalbano is light and humorous. Much of the humour involves Montalbano's personality and his interactions with the other characters. But there are also comic gems such as Officer Catarella with his linguistic difficulties and clumsiness.

In the books Camilleri's left wing politics are evident. There are plenty of sideswipes at Berlusconi and references to the links between the Mafia, big business, and corrupt politicians and police officers.  In one story, ""Rounding the Mark"", Montalbano considers resignation from the police force because he is disgusted at the (real life) police brutality directed against protesters at the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001. We do also see this sort of thing in the screen version, but rather less so than in the books.

There is only one thing that for me slightly spoils three of the books in the series, and which I hope won't appear in their TV versions. In ""The Track of Sand"" there is a brief episode where Montalbano seems to be living out events that he has previously experienced in a premonition-type dream. Similarly, in ""August Heat"" we have an incident involving telepathy between twins, and in ""The Scent of the Night"" there is a surreal episode in which Montalbano finds himself living out scenes from a novel he has previously read. The Montalbano stories are generally very down-to-earth, and I can't understand why Camilleri has slipped these brief paranormal incidents into three of the books. Over here we haven't got these episodes available in the TV version yet. But I'm hoping that these paranormal intrusions will have been dispensed with.

It has been said that the great thing about Raymond Chandler's novels is that they take you into the world inhabited by his creation Philip Marlowe: its places and its characters. Similarly, by either watching these DVDs or reading the novels, we can be transported into Montalbano's world.

4180994,5,B003R9IELI,"This continuation of the cases of Inspector Montalbano is, as are all the disks in the series, delightful and entertaining. The stories are extremely well done and essentially faithful to the books by Andrea Camilleri. They chronicle the cases of the irreverent and always clever inspector of the Vigata police on the island of Sicily. There is a very distinct Sicilian flavor to the series which makes them different than American or British crime stories. The close relationships between individuals and families, the sense of tradition and history, the love of good food and of life well lived permeate these stories in a way that is foreign to American detective fiction. One might call them police procedurals as long as you realize that in Sicily the best procedure is sometimes to ignore procedure. Together with the case at hand there is the ongoing story of the life and often rocky love affair of the inspector.

8403338,3,B003R9IELI,I'd give it a 3-1/2.  Some of the episodes are much better than others and some could have gone unwritten.  We like Montalbano's laid back style; some of the writers could do with a refresher course and make them more interesting.  We'll hold off buying any more for a while.,1505260800,,275,4.46
