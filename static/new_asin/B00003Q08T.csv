7919258,5,B00003Q08T,Being a wrestler since 1967 and coach since 1995 this tape gives to the novice wrestler and parent the best understanding of wrestling that I have found.  The tapes succintly provides the basic wrestling rules for the wrestling parent so that they can have a grasp of the rules and immediately enjoy the sport.  The tapes go on to develop winning wrestling strategies that are universal to all winning students of the sport.  I highly recommend these tapes to all wrestling programs who want to start a winning path from the beginning.,1063584000,4,535,4.793478260869565
7919259,1,B00003Q08T,"Unless you have never seen a wrestling match before, this video series is a waste of time and money.  I ordered these after reading the editorial and was extremely dissatisfied with the teachings and explanations.  They are only 15 minutes in length and cover only the most basic moves, moves learned in the first week of any quality wrestling program.  They do not explain the rules in full and lack the explicit detail needed to execute any move to it's fullest advantage.  I give it a 1 star rating only because I could not give it a zero.",1041552000,6,542,4.5
