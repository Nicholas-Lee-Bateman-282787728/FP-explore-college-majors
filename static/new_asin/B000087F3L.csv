7979391,5,B000087F3L,"On this second volume of Fred Harman's character from his comic strip ""Red Ryder Double Feature"" starring Allan Lane as Red Ryder (replacing Wild Bill Elliott) and Bobby Blake (Little Beaver) both were filmed and released by Republic/Sidney Picker Productions ~ directed by R.G. Springsteen in 1946 with screenplays by Earle Snell ~ Lane starred in seven Ryder series, with taut action and well staged fisticuffs between lane and villainous Roy Barcroft.

Opening oat eater is ""Stagecoach To Denver"" (56 mins-B/W-1946), featuring beautiful Peggy Stewart (Republic Studios leading lady), Martha Wentworth as the Duchess (Red's Aunt), Edward Cassidy as Commissioner Felton, Bobby Hyatt as Dickie Ray who needs an operation from a stagecoach collision, Tom Chatterton as Doc Kimball who will perform the surgery. Emmett Lynn as Coonskin, George Chesebro as Blackie Grubb, Edmund Cobb as Duke, Ted Adam as the not to trusting bad Sheriff, Forrest Taylor as Matt Disher...but all is not going smoothly when our favorite ""Bad Guy"" Roy Barcroft as Big Bill Lambert enters the picture and his scheme is pure evil (heh, heh, heh)...but never fear in his second Red Ryder Film, Allan ""Rocky"" Lane will save the day and lock up all the villains and the rest of the Republic stock company in the hoose-gow!

Second is an above average outing ""Vigilantes of Boom Town"" (54 mins-B/W-1946), featuring our favorite leading lady Peggy Stewart as Molly McVey, George Turner as legendary boxer ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett, Roscoe Karns as his manager Billy Delaney, John Dehner (Paladin of radio ""Have Gun Will Travel"" fame) as Bob Fitzsimmons in a title bout in the state of Nevada in Carson City, George Chesbro as Dink, Eark Hodgins as the Governor of Nevada, Ted Adams as the town sheriff, George Lloyd as a hired hand. Bobby Barber as Corbett's second and of course the ""King of the Badmen"" alias Mr. Roy Barcroft (real name Howard H. Ravencroft) who never ever disappoints his many fans for all the ""boo's & hisses"" that will come in the last reel ~ must not leave out the veteran stunt-men and women who bring much of the action, adventure and old west to life through tight fight fisted choreography and galloping chase scenes mixed with ""pure excitement"" on the big screen.
