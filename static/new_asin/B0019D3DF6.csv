3433053,1,B0019D3DF6,"I love old horror movies and I love cheap campy movies but this collection is just bad.
The Devil's hand has some nice cinematography and is the best in the set. Seems like there is an awful lot of saving Hitler's brain in these movies.",1257033600,2,236,4.266666666666667
3433054,4,B0019D3DF6,"To anyone who hung out at the drive-ins in the early 1960s or watched late night TV later in the decade, most of the titles in this 8 movie 4 disc collection will bring back fond memories. Crown International specialized in cheap fare for the drive-in crowd. Compared to them, American International was MGM but Crown International's films were edgier. Some of it was unquestionably the low budgets they were shot under but many of the scripts were tighter and pushed the envelope further than most of their contemporaries. No production code worries for CIP. They also employed such old timers as Lew Landers (RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE) who knew how to stretch a buck.

Two of the films, TERRIFIED and especially BLOODLUST (a remake of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME) are surprisingly graphic for the time and can still raise eyebrows today. Two other movies MADMEN OF MANDORAS and THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN are the same film. BRAIN is the TV version with extra footage added. THE DEVIL'S HAND (a voodoo story) and THE CREEPING TERROR (a monster film) are classic Grade Z schlock along with LAND OF THE MINOTAUR (despite Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance). THE HEARSE (w/Trish Van Devere) is the one true gem of the set.

Hats off to BCI Entertainment for making this series available. This is only one set out of four DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSICS DVDs and the only one devoted to horror films (the others are classic 70s sexploitation flicks like THE BABYSITTER and THE TEACHER). The quality of the prints is outstanding considering how rare some of these titles are and with a selling price around $10, you can't go wrong if you enjoy this type of movie. Long live Crown International! Independent movies made with cleverness and creativity to overcome the meager budgets they had to deal with.",1256688000,6,1781,4.816993464052287
3433055,4,B0019D3DF6,"The only good movie in this collection is ""The Hearse"" with Trish Van Devere. Land of the Minotaur was just lame and many of the other older movies followed suit. I guess it is okay as a collectors item for nostalgia buffs but I really didn't care for it
much. The movie with the doll was interesting. Trish Van Devere gives a good performance in The Hearse and if your looking for something spooky, it's a good choice. The music in the hearse is actually very pretty. They saved Hitlers Brain was just kinda... weird. I think if your wanting nostalgia the old black and white movies such as the day the earth stood still or the old war of the worlds might be a better choice.",1246838400,2,676,4.330708661417323

What exactly is on these disks? Instead, of a product description that lists all the titles, we get a set of incoherent movie reviews that mention fewer than half of them.  I can't even read all the titles listed on the box cover because when I blow up the image a couple of them are still illegible.

3433101,4,B0019D3DF6,"Okay, this DVD is worth the price of admission for The Hearse (a surprisingly okay supernatural B-thriller) and The Creeping Terror, a movie that defies description - watch it, then read up on the sad/hilarious story of how it came to be so... terrible. Terrible, yet utterly delightful.

As added bonuses:

- Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing in Land Of The Minotaur, which has something to do with satanic Greeks, a grumpy priest and pretty girls, but is entirely lacking in an actual minotaur - it's best watched drunk.

- Bloodlust, which is like a parody of The Dangerous Game starring Mike Brady, except they didn't intend to make a parody.

- The Madmen of Mandorus, which is like a loopy prequel to The Boys From Brazil and starring Hitler's brain.

- An innocuous film called Terrorized, with a plot that makes no sense and very little in the way of terror (save this one for when you've got nothing else to watch)

- The Devil's Hand, involving a hypnotic demon-seductress, a satanic cult and voodoo dolls. And catchy theme music.

3433103,4,B0019D3DF6,"Duncan commented on this collection having one movie per side of two sided discs, making the quality better.  While I agree, and that is the reason I am buying this collection, in defense of Mill Creek, they have been using 9 Gigabyte discs for some time in their multiple movies per disc collections, although I can't say for sure that was done in the other collection he mentions.  Many dvd players have in the on screen display a reading of the megabytes per second the disc is putting out.  One can tell the quality by the amount it is reading.  5 megabytes per second and higher is optimum quality, and you will know you are getting the best possible by that reading, although length of the movie also determines this somewhat, and if you have a movie that is over 90 minutes, a reading of around 4 megabytes per second is still optimum quality.  Movies from 60 to 70 minutes can read as high as 9 megabytes per second.",1335139200,6,924,4.443786982248521
3433104,5,B0019D3DF6,"I bought this collection to get 'The Creeping Terror', a film I've never seen but reputed to be one of the worst ever made. Well, yes & no. The basic plot idea is good, unique for the time, but not explained till the very end. The director tries hard, lots of monster point of view shots somewhat ruined by the victim's tendency to just stand there and gape in horror (when they could easily run away). The Creeping Terror is rather charming, though if you don't like slugs you might actually be a bit creeped out. The front is upright, containing some guy with his feet (disguised as psuedopods) kicking out from under the 'skirt' as he clomps along, the bulk of the monster's body billowing out behind him in a bumpy undulating train held up by perhaps two or three crouching people. Lots and lots of shots of it in broad daylight too. Why watch this film? It's delightful. Nobody is a trained actor. It's fun watching local townspeople and/or investors in the film doing their best to follow directions. The dance sequence is hilarious, all those lanky teenagers twisting up a storm and looking energetic but idiotic in the extreme. And the infantry tactics employed by the soldiers attacking the monster is beyond idiotic, totally inept. And the lovers lane sequence where the monster sucks people out of cars while a not too bright guy watches puffing on his pipe contentedly. Ed Wood Jr. would be envious. I consider this film highly entertaining. I enjoyed every moment of it. On a technical note the image is watchable, a bit washed out at times, but acceptable.",1306454400,4,1570,4.671480144404332

the big difference is that this collection puts one movie on each side of the disc, meanwhile the other one puts 2 on each side.  both are single layer on each side so this means they're cramming twice as much movie into the same amount of space.

3433110,4,B0019D3DF6,"""Drive-In Cult Classics Volume Two"" is a marked improvement on the first volume in the series and features eight films that range from laughable (""The Creeping Terror"") to modestly creepy (""Terrified""). All of these films are in the camp-as-high-art genre, and I recommend the set to connoisseurs of B-movies everywhere.

I started off with ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"", a cinematic travesty made over a decade or so by two different sets of people, starring two different sets of actors. What could possibly go wrong? The basis for the film is the very short 1963 feature ""The Madmen of Mandoras"", which was apparently shot years earlier and shelved for a while. In the late 1960s (1968 seems the most agreed upon date), some television brain trust wanted to broadcast ""The Madmen of Mandoras"", but it was too short to fit in a traditional movie time slot. They hired some film school students to shoot additional wraparound footage to boost the running time. The result is one of the most jarring viewing experiences in cinema history, and ranks up there with the very best of Ed Wood or Ray Dennis Steckler for enjoyable camp viewing.

The film opens with the newly shot footage of a smarmy male and a voluptuous female CID agent arguing and engaging in possibly the worst banter in film history. The acting and writing will both make you cringe; the good news is you frequently can't hear what's being said over the loud background music. It seems that the CID is investigating the death of a scientist who was working on the G-Gas project. The dead scientist knew of the antidote, and they discover that Dr. John Coleman another brilliant scientist, has been kidnapped and taken to the South American country of Mandoras.

The G-Gas plot sort of devolves into a ""Wild, Wild World of Batwoman"" pursuit of evildoers, with the movie going on to feature crazy Nazis planning to take over the world, Hitler's head in a jar (who the cast refers to as ""Mr. H"") yelling orders in German, a brain dead kidnapping and murder subplot, lots of stock footage, a supremely annoying and pathetic romance subplot, ridiculously inept car chases, doublecrosses, gunplay, explosions, a fire, and Hitler's head melting. Everything is here but the kitchen sink, and that may be here too, just too grainy and out of focus to see.

For someone who adores nonsensical B-movies, ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" is a film to marvel at, and I particularly recommend watching it back to back with ""The Madmen of Mandoras"", conveniently located on the flip side of the DVD.

I really should have watched ""The Madmen of Mandoras"" first, as it was the earlier of the two films made, and is a much more cogently produced picture. The version here is a new transfer, and looks very good compared with most other films of similar vintage. I started with ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" simply because I had seen it before, but ""Madmen of Mandoras"" was new to me. It has most of the same elements, but is markedly improved over ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"" for two essential reasons: it is much shorter, and it doesn't have the atrocious CID storyline or actors cluttering up the plot. The film still has plenty of annoying features, notably the little sister subplot (she is the most annoying character in the non-CID version of the film by a mile). From the dumber-than-rocks department, the main characters at one point dump a body in a phone booth in broad daylight; of course they didn't realize he had been shot either, despite sitting in a car next to him. Much like the glorious Ed Wood spectacle ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", there are lots of day-versus-night shots, and other marks of schizophrenically idiosyncratic filmmaking techniques on display here. I liked it much more than ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"", but it's still a laugh-a-minute cheesefest.

""Bloodlust"" is yet another retelling of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", Robert Reed and his inane friends stumble through terrible dialogue and the jungle attempting to evade Dr. Albert Balleau (Wilton Graff) and his henchmen who are dressed like Bastille guards.

Seeing a young Robert Reed is entertaining, but the rest of the cast is perfectly annoying, especially when the two girls have conversations like ""May I say it just once more please?""...""What?""...""I'm scared!"" The frolicking foursome (and the boat captain) are not terribly ingenious, and in one hilarious scene come up with the worst bluff ever in the history of motion pictures. After thrilling plotpoints such as a clambake, leeches in the quicksand, and taxidermy using a vat of acid, you'll be surprised that when the film is over it's only been 68 minutes long: it will feel like a lot longer.

There are certainly worse movies from the early 1960's, but I didn't need yet another retelling of a story I was first made to read in middle school. The script is terrible and the dialogue and stilted delivery made a potentially gripping early horror movie much less than it should have been. For horror completeists, this is worth seeing once, everyone else can move along.

 ""The Devil's Hand"" is a obscure movie about devil worship in middle income America. It gets two stars for unintentional hilarity and brevity. The quick version is that an ordinary man, Rick Turner (Robert Alda), gives up his entire existence (including his fiance) when ensnared in a Satanic cult by a witch via thought projection. Early in the film this manifests itself by having him mysteriously drawn to a weird doll shop. It turns out that Frank Lamont, the man who runs this shop, is also the ""High Executioner"" of the cult and holds rituals and human sacrifices in the stockroom in back. It will not surprise you to see Alda's fiance (well, ex-fiance by the end of the film) Donna (Ariadna Welter) as the surprise human sacrifice in the gripping conclusion. There is actually nothing here that will surprise you, as the plot is predictably straightforward right through the end, 71 long minutes after it started.

You might think that this would be a captivating subject for a film, and indeed it could be. Here, though, it isn't for two primary reasons: first, Alda has no issues giving himself over to ""Gamba"" (as the devil-god is known); second, the film is a showcase for congas and bongos as well as interpretative voodoo dancing. These two ingredients skewer any interest in whatever else may be going on in the film.

Watch for Neil Hamilton (Commissioner Gordon on the ""Batman"" series) as Frank Lamont in as good of a performance as could be expected given the material, and Bruno VeSota, who many will no doubt remember as Seltzer from the Jerry Warren classic ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman."" While it featured ultra-annoying music, terrible dream sequences, and a ridiculous plot, ""The Devil's Hand"" still wins for brevity and an utterly ridiculous concept.

""The Creeping Terror"" is an all-time B-movie favorite, easily as ridiculous as anything that Ed Wood ever came up with, although with worse production values. The filming was apparently marred by cast and crew departures and numerous technical issues, including loss of the soundtrack, requiring the spliced together monstrosity to be narrated to achieve a modicum of coherence. The first monster disappeared during filming, and a replacement monster was, if anything, even more ridiculous. The monster in question is a giant shag carpet from outer space who comes to Earth to eat coeds, interrupting a honeymoon and causing much horror and hilarity in its wake. This is one of the greatest of all B-movies, and I cannot emphasize how wonderful this film is.

""Land of the Minotaur"" is a 1977 Greek production starring Donald Pleasence as Father Roache, a priest who knows how to deal with an ancient, evil Minotaur monster dwelling in a picturesque Greek town. The film also stars Peter Cushing as the very picture of evil; unbelievably Cushing appeared the very same year in ""Star Wars"", also as (surprise!) the personification of evil. The movie starts with a former pupil of Roache's coming to visit and do some archeological exploration with some friends. Roache is welcoming (yet creepy) and cautions the explorers about the area, helpfully translating an inscription over a passage they go through as ""Those who enter the forbidden chambers of the Minotaur must die"". Pleasance is the same character he is in every movie, even though here he's the good guy. As the evil plot unfolds, Pleasence brings a detective friend of his from New York to help clear up the situation, although I can't fathom why: he is generally clueless and spends most of the film whining how religious Pleasence is. (He's a priest, remember?).

For a supernatural plot complete with guys in black hoods, sacrifices, chases, private investigators, ancient rituals, how could this be so...boring? The pace is absolutely slug-like, and with Pleasence as a good priest and Cushing as the priest of the Minotaur, there's never any doubt that the film is heading for a cataclysmic battle which will be won with the old crucifix ploy. The film has some atmospheric moments, but is more ponderous than scary.

""Terrified"" is an early psychological thriller that features plain awful acting and absolutely terrible audio. It's frequently hard to understand what's being said, but the plot is fairly straightforward: a college student is writing a term paper on terror, and decides to go undercover and finds himself the target of a lunatic killer in an old abandoned town at night. The premise is wholly implausible: two teens want to go visit an old wino (""Crazy Bill"") in a ghost town at midnight to ""ask him a question"". They go to the town and discover an extremely creepy cemetery. While the premise and acting may be sub par, the lighting and the cemetery and ghost town sets are excellent, really making this movie a lot more enjoyable.

You would expect that if two teens saw a man in a black mask and a murder in a cemetery in an abandoned town at midnight, they would go an get the police; instead these teens foreshadow the entire Scooby-Doo franchise by a decade and decide to go exploring the spooky graveyard, complete with tarantulas and masked villains. The film remains completely unbelievable until the very end, but despite dragging pacing in places, does manage to exude an atmosphere of creepiness and work in a chill or two. I won't reveal what happens to those meddling kids, but will say that while not without its moments, ""Terrified"" will not leave you terrified.

This set has eight very different films, some of which I liked more than others. My favorite of the bunch has to be ""The Creeping Terror"", which is side-splittingly funny, but all of them have their own peculiar charms. As a very nice bonus, there is an excellent color pamphlet inside the case which provides details on each of the eight films, a touch I really appreciated. For B-movie lovers, this will definitely cure whatever ails you!",1268265600,23,10950,4.893800539083558
