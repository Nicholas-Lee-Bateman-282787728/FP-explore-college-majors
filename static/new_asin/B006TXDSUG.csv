8504245,4,B006TXDSUG,"""I Killed Rasputin"" is a 1967 French/Italian co-production directed by French actor Robert Hossein telling the story of the death of the evil monk Rasputin by Prince Yusopov with a script by Hossein, Alain Decaux and Claude Desailly.  Prince Yusopov authorized the script.  Hossein cast the very talented Peter McEnery (""The Moon-Spinners,"" ""Entertaining Mr. Sloane,"" ""Negatives,"" ""The Game Is Over"") as the Prince with Geraldine Chaplin (""Les Uns et les Autres"" ""Cousin Bette""), Ira Furstenberg, Patrick Balkany and himself (""The Burglars,"" ""Les Uns et les Autres"") in major roles with a mis-cast Gert Frobe (""Goldfinger,"" ""$"") as Rasputin.  There are many incredible images photographed by Henri Persin, with magnificent set decoration and haunting music by Andre Hossein.  The movie is somewhat tedious and despite the poorly rendered and laughably tame orgies and, because Frobe is not a good choice as he lacks the ability to mesmerize viewers, it is otherwise fascinating.  One of McEnery's best performances.  The MOD DVD by VCI Entertainment is a vast improvement over the VHS released by MPI Home Video but lacks definition and is somewhat soft focus.  This is unfortunate as it is considered a big international film and has always needed to be more available.  A Paramount release in Eastmancolor.",1345248000,4,1308,5.315533980582524
