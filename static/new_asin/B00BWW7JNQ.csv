5679872,5,B00BWW7JNQ,"I grew up watching Pokemon and knowing the first 150 pocket monsters. It's great to finally own the first season and getting all 3 box sets was a great bargain. I have noticed that looking for the individual box sets of season 1 is becoming difficult. The first box set of season 1 is really hard to find (and also expensive if you do come across it), but it seems to have been re-released in slimmer case.

Anyways, I think it's good to get the entire collection rather than purchasing the individual box sets. Even though this complete season 1 collection is limited, I say it's worth getting.",1398470400,2,595,4.5092592592592595

8574906,5,B00BWW7JNQ,You get 79 episodes. Back cover on case shows the name of the episodes.  Thankfully Holiday Hi -Jynx is included. If you want first seasons of Pokemon buy 3 box edition. It's getting harder to find 3 box set now. So if I was you order you this set fast before it's gone. Don't get the Pokemon 2014 dvd edition. Cause you only get 78 episodes.

8574908,2,B00BWW7JNQ,"I'm not going to comment on the quality of the show which most people are probably familiar with anyways. If you want to see this show exactly as it was presented on 4kids all those years ago with no alterations whatsoever, you will probably like this a lot since that's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less.

I personally was very curious to watch this show subtitled to see a more true to the source material presentation but unfortunately, there are no subs available on this release. I guess it's my fault for not double checking the product details but I just assumed that it would have subtitles since every other anime product that I have ever owned had a subtitle option and I erroneously thought it was a standard feature. Another disappointment is the complete and total lack of any sort of bonus features. There aren't even any trailers. Nothing. This set is about as bare bones as it gets. It is just the show, edited for content, with the English dub, and that's all.

There's at least one episode missing, maybe more, for reasons unknown to me. Another strange thing I noticed is that, on one of the disk menus (which are very bland by the way), a picture of the main character Ash is shown but this picture actually comes from a much later season of the show which is apparent by the different outfit, making it glaringly out of place to anyone even casually familiar with the franchise. I don't even recognize the image they used there which means that it's at least past Johto. It seems like a minor thing but it's very unprofessional and reeks of laziness.

All in all, I can only recommend this product for people who only want a trip down nostalgia lane and don't care about anything beyond that. Quite frankly, I'd say save your money for a more competent release.",1421712000,2,1786,4.557632398753894
