8429786,5,B004I0EX8I,"I purchased this DVD a few years ago and I'm glad that I purchased it. Sitting in the ""Hot Seat"" as the last customer put it is the best way to learn what to say during a job interview. I would recommend this DVD also a voice recorder so that you can hear how you deliver. Over time you will get better and better.  I definitely would recommend this DVD to friends and family.",1445040000,,376,4.081081081081081

8429789,3,B004I0EX8I,"I was disappointed to see how the poor execution of a good idea really limited it's range. The idea of having interviewers (5 sets) ask questions giving you time during a pause to practice your answers is on target. But on this DVD,the accent would be difficult for non-native speakers of English state-side to understand. And their facial expressions! Never cracked a smile in the first interview, both interviewers! I used to interview many years ago and I was trained that it was a mutual ""sell"" operation; while you evaluate the candidate, you also present a positive image of the company by your demeanor. You don't wan't to scare away good potential employeees!",1333497600,2,667,4.911504424778761
8429790,5,B004I0EX8I,"I was recommended this DVD by my recruitment agent as I had lost a lot of my self confidence over the past eight months of job hunting.
Being able to put myself in the ""Hot Seat"" of a simulated interview was the best practice I could wish for, combine this with the downloadable work book and I was amazed at both the improvement in my confidence and the delivery of my answers.

Would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
