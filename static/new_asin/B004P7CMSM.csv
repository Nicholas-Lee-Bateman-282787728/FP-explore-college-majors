8437507,5,B004P7CMSM,"Pokemon 4Ever is such a beautiful movie. I love it so much. It is based on the video game series by Game Freak, and it takes place during the Johto League of the TV anime series.

The movie features the Legendary Pokemon Celebi, and Suicune. In the movie, Ash, Misty, and Brock meet a boy named Sammy who is from another time era. Sammy was teleported into Ash's time when he and Celebi were attacked. After the group meets with an old woman, they find out that Celebi is hurt. So they have to go and try to help Celebi in a mysterious forest. After they revive Celebi in the Lake Of Life,  an evil masked man wants to try to catch Celebi, and use it's power to take over the world. But the legendary Pokemon Suicune helps Ash and his friends in trying to stop the Iron Masked Marauder.

This movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. It is beautifully animated, and the American voice actors all do a wonderful job. Even one critic on the DVD cover called the movie ''Outstanding''. I agree 100%. This movie is also VERY emotionally effective. The ending makes me cry every time. It's a totally beautiful movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone.",1381449600,,1145,4.3915094339622645
