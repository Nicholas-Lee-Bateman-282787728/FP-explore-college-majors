This movie is camp at it's best. I liked The Swarm much better, but this is still a great movie.

3527917,4,B001DAIVXE,"...Not really, but before watching THE DEADLY BEES, I was all set to have loads of fun with my review. I couldn't use ""O Death, Where Is Thy Sting?"" as someone else had already come up with that so I came up with my own title. The problem is that after watching it, it's not half bad. In fact I really enjoyed it so my title is inappropriate but it's too good to waste. What makes KILLER BEES work for me is how low key it is. The script by Robert Bloch is solid and the characterizations are varied and believable. Most people bitch about the swarming bee effects but I have a good imagination and don't need for everything to be literal so I took them for granted and then moved on. If you want literal, check out Luis Bunuel's LAND WITHOUT BREAD and you can watch a donkey get stung to death right before your eyes.

Long time Amicus regular director Freddie Francis put his phototographic eye to good use here. The film not only looks good overall but the compositions of the camera shots and the movement within those shots keeps things interesting and at 82 minutes, the movie moves pretty quickly. I love the opening where we're treated to a behind the scenes look (ca. 1965) at how a live television program is staged. The pop group The Birds (no, not THE BYRDS!) featured at the beginning show off a young Ronnie Lane on guitar years before his gig with The Rolling Stones. Susanna Leigh makes for an attractive and an intelligent female lead. Guy Doleman is suitably dour, practicing for his Colonel Ross role in the Harry Palmer movies. Frank Finlay is quietly over-the-top in his trademark way and Michael Ripper is Michael Ripper yet again.

The story involves a pop singer who is sent to a remote island for some R&R. Once there she becomes involved with two local beekeepers, one of whom turns out to be a murderous psychopath. No points for figuring out which one as it's fairly easy and that's not really the point of the film. The point is how the story unfolds, slowly, which allows us to spend time with the characters and get to know them within the limited restrictions of an 82 minute film. The fact that Francis refuses to sensationalize the bee attacks, compensates for the lack of literal, high tech effects. THE KILLER BEES is not a great movie and has no pretensions of being so, but it is a remarkably well crafted old school thriller (as opposed to being an outright horror film) that still manages to entertain even if it's only in a nostalgic way.",1383436800,,2479,4.482300884955753

3527919,4,B001DAIVXE,This is a well done Hammer style horror flick. Well worth the time it takes to watch. If you enjoy Hammer you will enjoy this.,1363737600,,126,4.08
3527920,5,B001DAIVXE,"THE DEADLY BEES is a quiet find, a small, low-budget British offering that I first saw in a drive-in with another film in the States. I am now in China, as readers of my other reviews know. I ordered this film at the same time I ordered and watched two other insect films: THE NAKED JUNGLE and PHASE IV. Both of those are about ants -- one film over ten years older than THE DEADLY BEES; the other tens years newer.

I heard the story ""Leiningen and the Ants"" on Mystery Radio, which I can access here in China. I listened to the under-rated WIlliam Conrad play the part of Leiningen in the radio drama, and it made me interested in see the film that I remembered seeing in my father's small-town movie theatre as a boy. In the film, Charlton Heston plays Leiningen, and WIlliam Conrad plays the lesser part of a South American official. Heston does an admirable job in the role of a tough, self-made man who boasts (maybe too often) about carving his own empire out of the jungle. Some of you may know that William Conrad played Matt Dillion in the radio version of GUNSMOKE. His distinctive voice gave a virile presence to the role of the frontier marshall, much more than the wooden James Arness did for the popular, long-running TV series in the States. Most of you undoubtedly know that Conrad went on to play a tough, but overweight, cop on a TV series, the name of which escapes me at the moment. He also directed suspense films such as TWO ON A GUILLOTINE.

PHASE IV is a science-fiction thriller which features awe-inspiring microscopic photography of the world of ants. Why Saul Bass only directed one film is beyond me, because this little paranoid apocalyptic story is certainly worthy of being added to the pantheon of end-of-the-world productions and is certainly superior to the film 2012.

All three of the above-mentioned films are excellent productions in their own right. However, unlike the 1950s adventure with Heston and the 1970s sci-fi film featuring tiny but intelligent ants (when they work together, that is) , THE DEADLY BEES (Amicus) is a mystery thriller. The killer bees are being used as murderous weapons in this film -- the question is. . . by whom? At first, the pop singer, played by the lovely Suzanne Leigh (who later played a different type of character in the superior Hammer adventure THE LOST CONTINENT (my review of this is elsewhere on Amazon), believes that one character is the villain. The early scenes are carefully arranged to give her this suspicion. She is led to believe, with the help of mousy beekeeper Frank Finlay, that the surly, brooding, often angry Guy Doleman character is the cause of the deaths in the plot.

Doleman, in this film, is his own worst enemy, because his easily-annoyed personality and gruff voice set him up as the villain, particularly when his over-bearing wife is killed. He only seems to have a quiet appreciation for others when he addresses the pub keeper's daughter who has come to help his useless wife on the farm when Leigh is sent there to recover from exhaustion. The pub-keeper is played by one of my favorite British actors who plays so many minor -- but important -- roles in Hammer films: Michael Ripper. Even Ripper's character suspects the Doleman character because the carefully contrived evidence points him, as well as Leigh, in that direction.

In the end, we discover that all has not been what it seems, particularly when early scenes are revisited, but manipulated to show what really happened -- sort of the way Downy Jr. and Law reconstruct the evidence to point out what has really happened in the recent film SHERLOCK HOLMES. The special effects of the killer bees swarming to attack humans and a dog may not be particularly effective -- certainly nothing to compare with the close-ups for the activities of the intelligent ants in PHASE IV-- but the reconstruction of the story in order to retell it from a different perspective is certainly well-done.

Even though I am a Yank -- now an ex-pat -- I have always had a fondness for British films, particularly the Hammer horror films (many reviewed elsewhere), and I have always liked the actor Guy Doleman, better know as Harry Palmer's boss Colonel Ross in THE IPCRESS FILE, FUNERAL IN BERLIN, and THE BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN. He and Michael Caine play off each other quite well -- the no-nonsense Ross and the crafty, conniving Palmer. Doleman also has a brief role in THUNDERBALL as a villain who dared try to disable the indestructible James Bond. Too bad he is dispatched early in the film with a missile from a motorcycle. Of well, he is still around to give Palmer fits later. Maybe he appeared in many British productions, but I saw nothing of him in other films that made it to the States until THE DEADLY BEES.  In this film, he seems uncomfortably out of place as a husband of an unattractive, bitchy woman who owns the farm where he keeps his bees. He seems more at home in a gentleman's club in London -- particularly in THE IPCRESS FILE where he exchanges low-key banter with Nigel Green. Nevertheless, his surly manner in THE DEADLY BEES keeps him at the center of suspicion as the killer.

THE DEADLY BEES is certainly worth seeing if, like me, you enjoy low-budget British thrillers. it is also worth seeing for Guy Doleman's moody performance. As for Suzanne Leigh -- she is always worth seeing, whether in a Hammer vampire film like LUST FOR A VAMPIRE where she barely snatches the hero away from the clutches of the beautiful female vampire Carmilla, in the Bulldog Drummond detective thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE, or as the sex-starved vixen in THE LOST CONTINENT. With Leigh and Doleman and Ripper, how can you go wrong? Only if you are looking for cutting-edge special effects instead of a tight little thriller,",1273449600,7,5792,4.699507389162561
3527921,4,B001DAIVXE,"Here's an obscure film that has finally made it's way to DVD. One of the better Killer Bee movies and it's wrapped in a nice little mystery to boot! The Bee effects run hot and cold, but still deliver that creepy crawly feeling. I remember this film from Saturday's afternoon horror fest when I was a wee lad! The film holds up and is as entertaining as I remembered it to be. The DVD transfer look very good, but the titles etc seemed a little fuzzy, nothing too distracting though. It would have been nice to have some extras, even a trailer! Too bad, but it makes a fun Halloween flick!",1224547200,4,589,4.315315315315315

8292485,3,B001DAIVXE,"Modest little late 60's British horror flick.  Some strange deaths are occurring from bee stings on an small British farming island.  Who is causing it, the surly farmer or his next-door, down the road mild-mannered neighbor?  A young singer having a rest cure vacation at the farm tries to figure out the buzzing mystery a-la Nancy Drew.  My main question is, if one needs a rest cure why not go to a quiet off the beaten track tropical island with adequate facilities and not much tourism?  WHY go to a shabby run-down farm in late winter on an isolated island and stay with a bickering couple who obviously can't stand each other.  Even the local pub owner won't crack a smile.  JEEEZ.  Other than all that an OK time-passer but the bee attack special effects are at best sub-par.  The DVD quality is great but has no extras.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1414368000,,864,4.5519480519480515
8292486,5,B001DAIVXE,"I bought this movie because I have fond memories of seeing it on TV way back when.  It is a fun little non-thriller with not much of a mystery attached.  The story features killer bees.  There are two beekeepers on the same island.  One is obviously a mad scientist who developed the deadly strain of bees and then figured out a means of targeting potential victims through scent.  The other is just a beekeeper.  That gives you a 50-50 chance of guessing who the villain is (there are no other suspects).  Naturally, it takes forever for the authorities to figure out a crime has even been committed.  The poor bees get blamed for everything.
There's also one and a half pop songs offered, neither worth remembering.  The level of acting is sufficient (but arch); no one steals this movie from the bees and the perfectly awful bee FX.  Along the way, the lead actress (Suzanna Leigh as Vicki Robbins) gets to play at being Nancy Drew.  She also gets to romp about in a bra while swatting bees.  As melodramas go, it's a bit dry.  But I just had to have it for my collection because it's on the high side of hilarious.  I love movies like this.  It's suffocating in portent yet nothing grandiose happens to justify the ominous tone throughout.  Some will find it a bit flimsy and long in the tooth, some might find it rapturously awful.  I think it's great.",1412553600,,1357,4.495901639344262
