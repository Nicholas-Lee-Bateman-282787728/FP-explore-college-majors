Heidy takes the user way beyond time-wasting crunces in the neat little program.  Turned this skeptic into a believer.  Now I annoy all my friends telling them to BUY THIS DVD. NOW.",1404086400,,436,4.564102564102564

REVIEW: Yes, you will be sore. Man, am I sore! But hey, 3 weeks in and I am seeing A CUT STOMACH.

I picked this dvd because the description claimed that it would reveal my hidden 6-pack, Figured it was worth the price if it really could- And ladies, it did!

By summer will be flaunting my sexy belly, thanks to Heidy. Also, she's a welcome alternative to those 'drill-sargeant' instructors- You know who I mean!!",1397779200,,448,4.506172839506172
8620432,5,B00G3KW5RW,"As someone who's purchased quite a few workout DVD's in the past, I was originally hesitant to try another program that
 "" promised "" an improvement. After getting The Unleashed Body: Abs unleashed, I watched it from start to finish, before actually getting into my workout outfit and trying it out for myself. One thing that immediately struck me was the fact that I felt that someone was actually speaking to me, rather than an instructor who simply charges through a routine, with little or no thought as to who might be at the other end. Heidy's presentation was just perfect for my workout style. I've done about a small amount of pilates in the past, and it was easy to get into the program with this video.

Being in my mid 40's I've found that it gets harder and harder to take care of my trouble areas...lower and side abs specifically. I put some serious time in on my treadmill, but this still  has never addressed specifically the toning that I used to be proud of.
Within a few weeks of starting Abs Unleashed, I began to feel an improvement. I actually  felt  "" tighter "" in my trouble areas. After a bit more time, this feeling turned into results that I can actually see ! ( and I'm not the only one !! )

As with any program, repetition is the key, and not giving up when results don't show after only 2 or 3 days. The calm and peaceful manner with which Heidy guides you through the various routines made me eager to get in front of my TV, even after a hard day at work.

I'm so glad that I purchased Abs Unleashed, and look forward to purchasing more of Heidy's wonderful videos in the future.",1396396800,,1612,4.3533333333333335
