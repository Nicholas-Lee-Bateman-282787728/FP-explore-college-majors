8504907,1,1607130084,"I was most pleased to see that a CD version of the French Folk Dancing video and cassette tape set, previously published by Gessler, was on the market. Although the cost of the new version is a bit expensive, I decided to order it so I could have clearer sound. Unfortunately, the product is of very poor quality. The sound of the recording is fuzzy and doesn't amplify well. It was truly a disappointment. My hope is that a high quality product with French Folk Dancing instruction and background musice will be produced soon.",1243296000,,527,4.617021276595745
