no exercices, no details on anything... this DVD is just a joke !",1321488000,2,125,4.04
7992289,1,B00009P1MU,1/2 hour of Danny Morris playing with his band. No instructions on how to play or any techniques. I am a new beginner and it was not that helpful at all.,1241222400,2,153,3.967741935483871
7992290,5,B00009P1MU,"This is a brief but concise video where Mr. Morris demonstrates concepts that are important to a bass player no matter the type of music they play, and he does so simply and clearly so that the viewer gets insight into possibilities latent within each topic. Mr. Morris presents the concept first on bass without any other rhythm track, showing the chord progression or rhythmic idea. He is not showing off so you end up saying, 'wow, he's amazing' - although he is a wonderful bass player to hear and watch - but instead you get what he is talking about and showing and can carry it over to your own work.

Mr. Morris then repeats the concept with a backing track, develops it and riffs on it a bit, then the dvd cuts to concert material to see the concept used in his performance. The method to this dvd is well-thought out and something I will watch repeatedly to get further nuances. Also, Mr. Morris' passion about his instrument and the players that inspire him is so palpable, you just want to get on your instrument the moment the dvd ends.",1240358400,,1048,4.458333333333333
7992291,2,B00009P1MU,"This DVD has a five star review by Ms. S. Vandegriff.  It is not a five star product.  Vandegriff has four other reviews, all of Berklee products.  All of the reviews are five star and the all the descriptions contain the adjective ""great"".  I feel a bit misled.  The running time for this DVD is 32 minutes.  Most of the time is spent talking about the groove and working with the drummer.  There is not much time where Mr. Morris is actually playing the bass.  I thought that as the title implies, Mr. Morris might be demonstrating several rock grooves.  For me, the title does not correlate with the content.  There is not much to be learned by watching this DVD.  Two stars may be a generous rating.",1222128000,4,703,4.4140625
