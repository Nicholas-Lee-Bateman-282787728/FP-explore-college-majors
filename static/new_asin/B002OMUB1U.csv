3962110,2,B002OMUB1U,"So far, this is my least favorite of this series, followed by the CT version of Santa Claus conquers the Martians.  I was finding almost no humor in this.  For me, it was a long long long way from MST3K...and I'll probably never watch it or the other one I mentioned again.

After viewing, it had my pining for good old MST3K.  I'd just finished up watching that series 100% from the early years (well, what was available) then the 1st season all the way through to the 10th.  Before, I'd only seen the series with holes here and there since rights issues limited what was shown throughout it's run.  I felt CT was a natural series to follow it with.  So far, I'm pretty impressed with it overall.  Just not the 2 episodes I've mentioned here.  Glad others enjoyed them, I just didn't.  Looking forward to getting to the live episodes.",1388361600,,835,4.434210526315789
3962111,4,B002OMUB1U,"Not as funny as some of their others, like The Alien Factor or Danger: Tiki Island, in my humble opinion.",1384819200,,105,4.3
3962112,4,B002OMUB1U,I should say more than half the fun. I had no idea that there were so many copiers of this format. these folks do a good job. seems a tad too many of them. still it is a fun ride,1373328000,,178,3.475
3962113,5,B002OMUB1U,"I'm a fan of MST3K, and have seen a lot of those.  This is the first Cinematic Titanic I've seen, and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny and clever it was.  If you're an MST3K fan, I'd undoubtedly recommend this.  (I next watched the Cinematic Titanic episodes The Oozing Skull and The Wasp Woman, and they didn't reach the level of this one.)  Enjoy!",1372550400,7,356,4.430769230769231
3962114,4,B002OMUB1U,As a MSTie I have followed where the gang has headed....read some of Mike's books....Trace's comic...saw an episode of Frank's series etc etc. The Rifftrax and Film Crew stuff have been fine but I missed Joel. I watched the new season of Arrested Development and there was a flash of MST in there and I realized I had not checked out Cinematic Titanic. I'm glad I did. This episode wasgood but I think others will probably be better.,1372291200,,433,4.564102564102564
3962115,5,B002OMUB1U,"Legacy of Blood is a classic.  It has been riffed by many in the past, but none quite as well as Cinematic Titanic.  They really made an enjoyably bad movie a must see.  You will love it.",1371254400,,187,4.0
3962116,4,B002OMUB1U,"Having watched all of the MST3Ks that were free on Prime I was happy to see a few Cinematic Titanic selections become available.  Legacy of Blood is the first I've watched so I don't know the setup (why their silhouettes are setup as they are in this vs. MST3K, Cinematic Titanic seems to take up more screen space) but the jokes are there and that's what is most important.

As to this specific movie--Legacy Of Blood--wow what a strange one!  The 70's were a crazy time when even good movies were odd making bad movies off the charts, but at least this means there was plenty of material for the crew to riff off.  I'd give this one 4/5.  It's better than some of the drier fare MST3K chewed through like Red Zone Cuba or The Starfighters, but miles short of Final Sacrifice or Manos the Hands of Fate.  It had a bit of ""gore"" that probably wouldn't have been allowed on the series though it is still extremely tame by modern standards.

Kudos to Amazon for getting it onto Prime, it's worth a viewing!",1370736000,5,1004,4.394594594594595
3962117,5,B002OMUB1U,"Price issues aside, and despite an extra terrible film, this is some strong work from the gang. Damn Funny.
And, for me, Frank Conniff is elevated to genius status simply for the moment when he works in an obscure Tom Waits phrase into the riffs. Nuff Said.",1344038400,3,257,4.48936170212766
3962118,5,B002OMUB1U,I want to thank the previous poster. I went to the CINAMATIC TITANIC website where they have all these films for $14.99.,1293580800,7,120,4.5
3962119,5,B002OMUB1U,"Look, it's the MST3K guys back in action. You know if you want it or not. What you may not know (OK, you probably know, but juuuust in case) is that you can buy these movies for far less at Cinematic Titanic's own web site. Plus, they can be downloaded as ipod or android apps from their respective marketplaces. Do a little searching and get this, from the original legitimate source, for less than half what these sellers are trying to get from you.",1287532800,17,451,4.380952380952381
3962140,4,B002OMUB1U,"In this deservedly forgotten 1971 grindhouse movie, an insane millionaire's loathsome family, hoping for a fat inheritance, is bumped off over the course of one very long night. You get overacting galore, incestuous love, a guy who looks like Burt Reynolds dressed as Freddie from the Scooby-Doo cartoons, a color film so murky it might as well have been shot in black and white, and some pretty sharp riffing from the CT crew.

I could've done without the tedious comedy skit they performed while the film was paused; the movie itself was hard enough to watch. I'd call this a solid CT performance, not as out-of-the-ballpark funny as ""Danger on Tiki Island,"" but entertaining enough to ease the pain of watching this hamfest.",1420329600,,727,4.9105691056910565
3962141,4,B002OMUB1U,We like it very much!,1419897600,,21,3.4
3962142,4,B002OMUB1U,This movie is so wrong that only Cinematic Titanic can make it right.,1418860800,,69,4.384615384615385
3962143,5,B002OMUB1U,"I thought this was pretty funny, almost as funny as Mst3k.",1418428800,,58,4.363636363636363
3962144,3,B002OMUB1U,Lots of laughs.  Terrible film.,1418083200,,31,5.2

3962146,5,B002OMUB1U,"Most of the MST3K folks are back in this 2008 followup to the original series. This time the movies are full-length, and there are no robots - although the actors who performed them are here. I think there are only a few episode of (less than 10), but this and the other episode of Cinematic Titanic I've watched are really pretty fully. Check it out!",1412553600,,351,4.415384615384616
3962147,3,B002OMUB1U,I've seen it twice. Laughed out loud both times. I like the 5 person format. Makes the riffs more varied and constant. BTW the ending of this movie is worth watching it. Laugh just thinking about it.,1407196800,,199,4.405405405405405
3962148,1,B002OMUB1U,Stupid movie.,1407196800,,13,6.0
3962149,4,B002OMUB1U,"Definately the best of the series, some of the scenes in the actual film don't seem like they really belong to the film (or plot) itself. A cornicopia of corniness ,poor cinematography, and, I use the term lightly, bad actors. The MSTY crew has a hay day on this one!",1406678400,,267,4.36
3962160,5,B002OMUB1U,Very clever.great to hear Joel doing what he does best.,1405814400,,55,4.6
3962161,1,B002OMUB1U,"Horrible acting and bad quality all the way around.  I can appreciate something that is so bad-its good, however I did not find this one entertaining.",1403136000,,150,4.769230769230769
3962162,3,B002OMUB1U,"Well, this is a really bad movie and some of the jokes are really funny so it has that in common with MST3K.  Otherwise though some  riffs just fall completely flat and missing are those obscure riffs that MST3K had. Not bad, but not wonderful either.",1401062400,,251,4.434782608695652
3962163,3,B002OMUB1U,"What made the MST3K episodes so successful was the creative wit and the wholesome decorum which made the satires suitable for everyone. Now, this talented crowd has descended to unnecessarily include more tacky, and sometimes vulgar remarks which only serve to narrow the audience. From 5 stars to 3. Wish you could all get together and resurrect the old formula including the robots.",1394668800,,384,5.111111111111111
3962164,5,B002OMUB1U,"Another great show from Cinematic Titanic, overacting galour, riffs aplenty, very enjoyable from start to finish.  Ending a bit predictable, but no matter, watch it for the riffing and enjoy.",1393459200,,191,5.366666666666666
3962165,5,B002OMUB1U,"I've been a fan of MST3K since it debuted so I'm biased towards this type of entertainment.  It was through Amazon that I found out about the Cinematic TITANIC (CT) series and I'm grateful for it.  After watching every Prime-available MST3K a number of times I was looking for something new.

Legacy of Blood is a really bad movie based on a simple formula.  The family patriarch dies, the will is read and his servants and surviving children (heirs) spend some time in his home.  Along the way cast members die.  The CT crew then go about riffing as they do so well. Aside from the stereotypical roles (a servant named, Igor. ""Body by Charles Atlas.  Head by Mel Brooks."") and poor acting there are some REALLY strange set pieces and scenes which lend themselves to necessary ridicule.  ""Salvador Dali called.  He said he doesn't get it.""

If you enjoy MST3K-style humor then I recommend you give this movie a go.  There is a bit of gore involving piranha and bees that is not appropriate for some.  Otherwise, the dialogue is clean and there is limited sexual innuendo.",1393200000,5,1071,4.638297872340425
3962166,5,B002OMUB1U,The kind of movie and the kind of riffs that Joel and the MST:3000 crew were born to handle. Very funny. Sad they won't be plying their unusual craft any more!,1392681600,,159,4.161290322580645
3962167,5,B002OMUB1U,A horrible film featuring John Carradine and the guy who played James Dean's brother in EAST OF EDEN.  Watching this film makes you think Dean made the better career decision of the two.  The old MST crowd does an excellent job with this incomprehensible film.,1391299200,,260,4.7555555555555555
3962168,5,B002OMUB1U,Did not disappoint always witty And hilarious a great way to kill an hour .god I hate writing the damn reviews. Just take my money and f offf,1390867200,,141,4.071428571428571
3962169,5,B002OMUB1U,"I love all the Cinematic Titanics, but this one ties with Alien Factor at #1. The perfect cheesy movie combined with brilliant riffs!",1389916800,,133,4.826086956521739
8376171,5,B002OMUB1U,There's no excuse for not watching this.,1442361600,,40,4.857142857142857
8376172,4,B002OMUB1U,Very funny riffing of an awful film. Would not be worth watching except for the fine riffing from the CT crew! A must see for any MST#k fan!,1441584000,,140,4.035714285714286
8376173,4,B002OMUB1U,"An awful movie with funny commentary by the gang behind MST3K.  This one has it all, bad acting, bad cinematography, bad script, bad direction, bad catering, if you count the head under tin foil scene.  Good stuff to laugh at that will never make it to TCM",1439769600,,256,4.425531914893617
8376174,1,B002OMUB1U,"The movie dubbed in with sarcastic comments is ludicrous and without any merit, whatsoever.  Ditch the idiots making stupid comments and it might have been worth a watch!",1439683200,,170,5.071428571428571
8376175,5,B002OMUB1U,Must see for MST3K fans,1431388800,,23,3.8
8376176,4,B002OMUB1U,"The commentary is great, classic MST3K, but the movie is SLOOOOOW. Gave up on this one about halfway through.",1430697600,,109,4.7894736842105265

8376178,5,B002OMUB1U,"Amazing cast from an amazing show reunite to riff on yet another lackluster film.  While the jokes and cast are hilarious the film itself is rather boring and difficult to pay attention to.  Fortunately with the original MST3k crew you don't have to worry about paying too much attention to the film on screen, just the actors riffing away below.",1426982400,,346,4.75
8376179,3,B002OMUB1U,This was decent. Not their but not their worst. The movie was one of the worst but the jokes made it so much better.,1426377600,,116,3.875
8376180,5,B002OMUB1U,Having the riffing team back together for cinematic titanic makes for great fun. they do a masterful job of transforming movies that aren't really watchable into something really humorous. We enjoy the format and the overall quality of the whole presentation.,1425945600,,259,5.341463414634147
