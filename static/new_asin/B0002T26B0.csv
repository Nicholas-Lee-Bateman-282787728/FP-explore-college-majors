8178096,5,B0002T26B0,"Picture quality is astounding. What one would expect from their (Japanese) animated remasters. Just as uncompressed and beautiful as Do You Remember Love (DVD remaster), Macross Plus (DVD remaster) and Perfect Blue (DVD remaster). Audio is Japanese PCM, so yeah. No English subtitles though. Box art is rather underwhelming, as is the sleeves for the 4 DVDs. But the artwork for all, if not most remasters' is never really as good as the first edition releases.",1483401600,2,461,5.078947368421052
