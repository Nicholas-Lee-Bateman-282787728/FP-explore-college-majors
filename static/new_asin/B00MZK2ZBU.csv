6605033,5,B00MZK2ZBU,"I absolutely love Turbo Jam. Its by far my favorite workout. I own alot of different workout DVDs and this one has the best music and really good routines. It really works you because its fast paced, but there are alternative moves and you still get your heart rate up. Charlene makes the work out so much fun.",1492387200,,310,4.362068965517241
6605034,5,B00MZK2ZBU,"I had worn out my first set of disks bought in 2007 from ordering by phone.

It is great to have the complete set of workouts again which I really like because I sometimes get sore heels from other aerobic routines, even the low impact ones. Chalene's workout team with two people demonstrating the low-impact alternative are great.",1492128000,2,332,4.724137931034483

8675496,3,B00MZK2ZBU,"I am a huge music person. It keeps me going. I have used it before to lose weight and it has worked in the past. However, I purchased it thinking it was going to work again but now it seems boring and the music doesn't motivate me. It has a great work out but I just wished it had better music.",1517184000,,294,3.8360655737704916
8675497,5,B00MZK2ZBU,"I discovered Turbo Jam on the BeachBody on Demand service. I have tried many workouts over the years.  The Firm ""fanny lifter"" series is my fave, but I've been with it so many years, I'm always looking for a new workout that I can rely on and truly look forward to.  This is it!  My favorites are the Turbo Sculpt (so I can still get some cardio and sculpting similar to the Firm style) and the Cardio Party Mix.  I love the progress bar and timers for each section. They keep me motivated through each section and make the time fly!  Charlene is high-energy and fun.  Lots of ways to level her workouts.  I like to move, but don't like high-impact/lots of jumping, and this is perfect.  I have all the videos via the online service, but I love them so much, I am here for the DVD, so I have more options for using it where I don't have streaming service.  GREAT WORKOUTS!",1515456000,,872,4.2682926829268295
