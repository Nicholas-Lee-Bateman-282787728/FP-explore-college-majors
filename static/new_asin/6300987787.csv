301948,5,6300987787,"All right, I'll begin by saying that ""Yes! This is the movie from the Metallica video"" Good, now that is out of the way..... This is one of the finest works of cinema you will ever see. The story is along the lines of a train wreck (you can't stop watching no matter how much you want to). It is a beautifully twisted look into the mind of a man whos only remaining sense is touch. Which is not much when you have no arms or legs. The feel of the sun on his skin is the only way he can keep track of time. His memories are his only company. This film will let you see how a man can be trapped in his own body. You will be disturbed, uncomfortable, and the memories of this movie will creep up on you when you're alone in the dark. Enjoy.",999734400,16,737,3.92

301997,4,6300987787,"Rescued from obscurity by inclusion in the video of Metallica's 1989 hit single ""One,"" this is a powerful and uncompromising drama about a soldier (Timothy Bottoms) who loses both arms, both legs, his sight, his hearing, and his speech in WWI. Still able to think, he lies in a hospital bed for years, wishing for death. While devoid of gore, the movie is very psychologically unsettling because of its subject matter, and a very disturbing performance by the 18 year old Bottoms in a sensational screen debut. The scenes that take place in the hospital are excellent. The dream or hallucination sequences of the Bottoms character are weird more than anything else, but overall, this is a very good anti-war movie. And make sure you buy the version of the DVD with the bonus materials; they're a great enhancement to the movie.",1470096000,8,827,4.830985915492958

302000,1,6300987787,"I purchased this because I am familiar with the TV version from many years ago and wanted to have this in my DVD collection.  Unfortunately, there was no warning that the PG rating for this does not reflect the R content.  I was not prepared for the obscene language and nudity that do not add anything relevant, but instead completely detract from the story.  I didn't finish watching the movie.  The only reason I may choose to keep this DVD instead of tossing it into the garbage is the Metallica ""One"" video which I previously owned on VHS and loaned to a friend's son a few years ago, never to return.  The ""One"" video is worth the purchase price, but the movie itself is a disappointing dud.  Too bad I can't buy the version that I first saw years ago that focuses on the compelling story without the unnecessary content.  If I could buy the Metallica video on it's own, this DVD would be a goner.",1465430400,,903,4.403614457831325

My date and I really did not know what to think of it at first when it ended. Then we found out later it was Dalton Trumbo's protest against war. And it delivers!  But there are some great, serious scenes with Donald Sutherland playing Jesus Christ.  A great movie to see again if you were one of those who did not 'see the leopard' in the late 60s and early 70s. If you do not 'see the leopard' in America's adventures today, you may want to see this to support some of your reasons why you don't.
  I will not deny that I was 'protected' from the draft by my college deferment and was glad of it.

This is a preachy anti-war movie.  I guess, depending on your point of view, the voiceover narration is an excellent method to convey how we are unable to communicate about the horrors of war.  For me, it made the movie preachy and draggy.

Also, the voiceover narration was absolutely required by the director's choice to have  the hero have absolutely devastating injuries including blindness, muteness, loss of limbs.  It asks much of an audience to ask us to empathize with a protagonist whose face we cannot see.  Perhaps, I was not a good enough audience.",1399852800,,707,4.745901639344262

302184,1,6300987787,I saw this movie when it first came out years ago and it was absolutely awful.  I consider it the worst movie I've ever seen.  My husband and I started watching it the other night mostly out of morbid curiosity because we had such bad memories of it from long ago.  The thought of a keeping a soldier alive that has lost all limbs and is nothing but a torso and a head is absolutely horrible not to mention cruel.  This movie should have never been made.,1398038400,5,454,4.183908045977011

302187,5,6300987787,"I got interested in this movie because of a metallica video and the psychological aspects (I'm a psych major). I thought it was very interesting how they chose to do some parts in color and other parts in black and white. It seems very fitting that the hopeless present situation be in black and white and memories and dreams be in color. I felt sorry for the poor guy. The only sense he had left was his cutaneous senses. However, he manages to learn to understand his environment through vibrations, warmth and cold, touch, and texture. Time becomes very important to him. The situation for him is gloomy. It's hard to imagine being in his position. His thought process and coping mechanisms are intriguing to say the least. I think they did a really good job with this movie and I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I didn't really like is it didn't have much of a closure in my opinion. It seemed like suddenly things changed and then it just ended. The way it ended whith his thoughts was conclusive but the ending as a whole felt lacking. This great new development happens and then it's done. I really did like the movie though. The story itself does sort of speak against war but it's about a man trapped in a terrible situation to be used as a sort of experiment and the psychological effect it had. There is very little action and almost no war scenes so if you are looking for war movies with battle action, this isn't it. It is sort of anti-war though. In fact it almost seems for war the way people in the movie in his dreams and memories talk, except it's not. The way people thought about things and the social pressures that led to him joining the army are shown but then we see the awful outcome of what happened to him because he was persuaded by those pressures and ideals to join the army.
Also be warned, there are naked scenes and suggestive scenes. There aren't many, but there are some.",1396310400,,1921,4.444759206798867

I can say that the scenes still do not mess up the movie. but its a shame they couldn't get the whole thing on one disc. but as I said the DVD is a beautiful transfer. just wish it was complete. maybe one day they re release this in its entirety. but untill then if you're a purist I suggest you find a transfer from the VHS. either war. this movie is a masterpiece. just wanted to give a little insight on the different releases of this.,1376179200,5,848,4.102409638554217

That scene is just as true today as it was when the movie was made.  And even when the book was written.

Additionally, the scene where Jose is discussing how to get fired is missing.

302326,4,6300987787,"This is a film that will bring tears to your eyes, with its anti-war message and frustrations felt by a crippled soldier. Joe is an American soldier, who loses most of his body parts in an explosion in the waning days of World War I, and finds himself in the supply room of a military hospital. He can't speak and is kept alive by air and feeding tubes. The doctors and nurses believe that he is a ""vegetable,"" but his mind can function well. Joe doesn't know what is real and what is a dream. He doesn't know what country he's in or what year it is.

The flashbacks of Joe's life and the war are very moving. The patriotism, followed by the stupidities of the Great War are dramatized quite nicely.

Joe struggles to communicate his thoughts, and finds a way. But that's for you to discover, when you watch the film.

302371,5,6300987787,"this 1971 movie, based on the famous 1939 anti-war novel of the same name by Dalton Trumbo makes a powerful and obvious statement about the horrors of war, but I also think that it makes an impassioned statement about the need to treat people with disabilities, no matter how profound, with dignity and humanity.

As the film opens, a team of doctors stares down at the breathing but otherwise completely incapacitated victim of enemy shelling. The unidentifiable soldier, we learn as he does, has lost both of his legs and arms, as well as most of his face. More importantly, the medical diagnosis is that he has lost nearly all of his brain function, except for the autonomic brain stem function which keeps him alive. The doctor in charge calls him ""decerebrated"" (lacking in higher brain functions) and orders that he be kept alive and cared for so that they can see what they can learn from him.  He further commands that the staff involved in the care of the patient not become emotionally involved with him, as he cannot think or feel anything at all. The young GI, it turns out has a very active mind, and throughout the two hours of the film experiences thoughts, flashbacks, dreams and desires, although he is unable to hear or see or communicate.

Once he was whole and active as any other young American male. He was Joe Bonham, caught up with the desire to ""make the world safe for democracy"" and do his part in by serving his country to fight in The Great War. He seemed to have a romanticized view of the war, and he had no second thoughts about leaving his family behind, even though his father was dead. He had no problem leaving his girlfriend, Kareen, behind either, even though she repeatedly begged him not to go. She was sure he will be killed, but this did not bother him. What he never considered is that a fate perhaps worse than death itself could await him.

In between the flashbacks and vignettes, we see the patient lying on a hospital bed mostly covered. He has a blanket or sheet over what is left of his body. His face, except for his forehead is covered by a mask. His curly hair and his neck with a breathing tube are visible. He struggles with trying to find out what happened to him, where he is, how much time passes, and how to communicate. I find it interesting the doctors insisted that the patient be sequestered away from everyone else to such an extreme that he ends up in a storage room with even the windows shuttered and the door locked. If he moves around too much they give him a sedative. Basically he is just considered to be a lump of flesh.

(sorry for some spoilers). Eventually a nurse opens the window and he can feel the sunlight on his face. Eventually another nurse feels compassion for him and touches him lovingly. He exults as he learns to interpret the letters which she draws on his chest, spelling out ""Merry Christmas"". He finally thinks of a way to communicate by tapping his head in Morse Code. Medical staff, including the original doctor are brought to his room to witness this communication. Now that they know that he is a thinking, feeling man, does this bring him more humane treatment and end his isolation? Will he find a reason to want to continue to live?  These questions and their answers are what make the ending of this film interesting, and I think have insight for our treatment of the severely disabled in general.",1298160000,,3399,4.536704730831974

This was a time when MTV was actually a music channel, with music video's on air all day and all night.
Today, MTV is a completely worthless channel that has nothing to do with music anymore.
But anyway, back in the good old days the ""One"" video introduced me to real music and made me fall in love with it permanently.
Later on in my life, I learned what the brilliant lyrics of James Hetfield were all about; both the song and the imagery told the tale of a young World War One soldier who lost his arms, his legs, and even his own face during the battle in the trenches. But he lives on, trapped for life in the deepest Hell-bowels of his own mind. These fragments came from a ruthless anti-war film called ""Johnny Got His Gun"". I never found a copy in shops nearby (I live in Belgium), so I bought the DVD online. I think every old-school Metallica fan like me should see this film, because maybe we have the privilege of understanding the pain and tragedy of this story in a deeper way than the rest of the world.

302376,5,6300987787,"I first came across this film on YouTube. Having a few hours of free time, I decided to watch the film and see if it was really as good as the reviews on Amazon.com would suggest. I was not disappointed.

The film is a most powerful inditement of needless wars and a military industrial complex that cares little for the lives of ordinary citizens like Joe. Through following Joe's present situation of having lost nearly his entire body (scenes filmed in black and white) and interspersing these horrific scenes with reminiscences from the past (scenes filmed in color) which over time become less and less reliable, the viewer receives an incredible contrast between the tragedy that is and the possibility that might have been.

I have not read Trumbo's novel by the same name, so I cannot say for certain how loyal the film is to Trumbo's intent.

However, standing alone, the film is still a powerful motion picture and one that I absolutely recommend, especially for Americans who prefer the neoconservative (Kristol, Cheney) approach to foreign policy ['preemptive wars'] over that of Ron Paul and Alex Jones. Hopefully, the film will at least open up the eyes of people who think 'war is peace' and that the next war will be the 'war to end all wars.'

Also, I believe the film does a good job questioning the omnipotence of Jesus Christ (played by Donald Sutherland), who is unable to assist Joe in either finding hope or ending his life.",1275696000,,1447,4.752988047808765
302377,5,6300987787,"The first two paragraphs are taken from a review of Dalton Trumbo's novelistic treatment of the film under review. The points made here apply in general to the film:

""The subject of war has had all sorts of novelistic treatments, the most successful usually treading lightly on the war action itself and delving into the personal choices and consequences of the characters as their central aim. In that odd sense the most compelling novelistic treatments are either pro-war (for some seemingly rational reason like defending one's country, coming to the aid of a smaller, weaker country, etc.) or neutral to the more physical and psychological dimensions of the situation. A flat out, anti-war (or, to use a more vague term, pacifistic) treatment is usually not successful either because it has a ""preaching to the choir"" quality or strikes some false chord. That is not the case with Dalton Trumbo's ""Johnny Got His Gun"".

Although this novel was written under the sign of the Hitler-Stalin Pact in the late 1930s, reflected in Communist International and American Communist Party political line as one of intense opposition to Western war preparations it brings more home truths than merely another piece of `communistic' propaganda and it would be incorrect even for staunch anti-Stalinists to dismiss it out of hand. Joe, the main character here, maimed beyond belief and repair, is every mother's son, every American mother's son. His interior monologue, as he remembers his past, his lost youth, his desires and the useless way he was used in the last days of World War I is almost unique in the way the story unfolds. It certainly is not for the faint-hearted, or the weak-minded. As steps are now being taken to up the ante in Afghanistan, another one of those wars to `defend' democracy, or whatever the reason of the day is, this thing should be required reading for every mother, and every mother's son and daughter who seeks to put him or herself in war's way.""

The film pretty faithfully follows Trumbo's, or at least the spirit of Trumbo's, main point. Off a reading, or rather re-reading of the novel I thought that it would be hard to sustain a film based on the lack of ""action"" in the story line. That is dealt with two ways-flash backs by Joe to sunnier times and by ""dream"" sequences featuring the likes of Donald Sutherland, as Jesus, giving his droll interpretation of Trumbo's message. This is not an easy film to get through; certainly not for those who like their entertainments light, but the pathos of the scenes as Joe tries to make sense of his ""new"" world is cause for reflection. That said, could one find a better actor than Timothy Bottoms to play the role of Joe, the fresh-faced ""dough boy"" filled with illusions, filled with thoughts of invincibility, but also filled with dreams and sorrows as he goes off to war. Kudos here. And thanks, brother Trumbo",1273276800,,2891,4.836363636363636

The political agenda and philosophical premise may fall apart upon close examination, but the very human story of a young American soldier in WW I who loses all his limbs and four of his senses is as unforgettable as his novel.  There's no blood and gore here.  It's the bandaged stump of a man's memories, feelings and especially sense of touch that burn in his soul.  Timothy Bottoms is terrific as hallucinating war victim Joe Bonham and Donald Sutherland makes an interesting appearance as Jesus.  With the limited technology available to merge dreams, memories and reality, this film suffers here and there.  But the empathetic story of one human suffering for a nebulous cause is searing in its timeless depiction of the price paid by old men in suits who see youth as gun fodder for their dubious political or capitalist agendas.  The last transfer of the DVD of this title appears to be a slightly truncated (censored?) version compared to my memories of a once daring PBS broadcast.",1252454400,2,1191,4.866336633663367
302414,5,6300987787,"""Johnny Got His Gun"" tells the shattering story of a young war veteran whose limbs are amputated and whose eyesight, hearing, and speech are destroyed from an explosion during combat.  The movie emphasizes the harrowing and irreversible costs of war.  It presents military commanders who are skillful at conducting war, but who fail miserably to comprehend the resultant human suffering and deprivation.

The story makes a powerful plea for the right of an individual to chose his own fate.  Johnny begs army officers to allow him to die, but they ignore his desperate requests.  A courageous and compassionate nurse understands Johnny and mercifully disconnects his breathing tube so he can die swiftly and be released from his body which has become a prison. But infuriatingly, his superior  reconnects the tube so that Johnny can live on indefinitely in a state of complete helplessness, hopelessness, and despair.

""Johnny Got His Gun"" is not only an indictment against war, but it rails against the complacency and incompetence of bureaucracy where our so-called leaders are too dense and too cowardly to do the right thing.  It's much easier for them to stick with the status quo, in this case prolonging life regardless of the quality of that life and ignoring the right of an individual to chose his own future.

Writer-director Dalton Trumbo was himself a victim of bureaucracy lead by Senator Joe McCarthy's committee on ""UnAmerican"" activities which sought out and branded so-called communist sympathizers causing these people to lose their livelihoods and even go to prison.  Trumbo was one of these people who were denied due process and even the basic constitutional right of free speech and free association.  Isn't that in itself ""unAmerican""?

Trumbo is beyond brave in delivering an intense and uncompromising vision of war, of those who wage war, and of those who are forced to live with the irreparable consequences of war.",1249257600,2,1943,5.133333333333334

It looks like the tape is running at different speeds.  If this was intentional by the filmakers, I do not know.  This was very distracting to watch.  You can tell everything is 'looped' too(where actors re-record their lines) because their mouths rarely matched what was being heard.  But this is an old movie so I can understand that a little - a lot of 70s movies have that issue(Dirty Harry, Deliverance, etc).  The making-of is not really a making of.  It spends most of the 49 minutes talking about how the director was blacklisted in the 1950's which I didn't care to hear about.  I was more interested in the making of this movie than the directors career.  The Metallica video is flawed.  It looks like someone hit the pause and play button rapidly every 10 seconds, giving it a really weird movement.  It was out of sync.  This is not the way the video is on a Metallica 'The Videos '89-'03' DVD from a few years ago.  The above issues, along with the editing mentioned in other reviews, makes me say you are better off renting it and not buying it like I did.  The jerky movements are distracting.  If I want to see that I can watch the 3 stooges and see how they speed up the film when they do pratfalls, etc.  Overall I like the movie, just not the presentation of it on this DVD.",1242777600,,1424,4.377862595419847
302420,3,6300987787,"Johnny Got His Gun is one of my favorite films and by far the most depressing I've ever seen. I recommend it to just about anyone... however, I have a few issues with this DVD.

First of all, it IS edited. I have a VHS copy and Kareen is definitely shown nude from the front in it. I'm not sure what else was cut out, but based on the different running times mentioned in other reviews, there must be more and I find this annoying and unnecessary.

Also, I'm not sure if it's just my copy, but I am unable to watch the music video or the interview with Timothy Bottoms. When I try to select them, the trailer plays. This is something I have to take up with the company, I guess, but just beware!

The quality of the DVD itself is fine. The sound isn't that great, but I didn't expect it to be... and it's audible to healthy ears. The problem is those with not-so-great ears have no way to follow it since there are no subtitles. What the hell, people? It's 2009!

I am still thrilled to finally have this on DVD since I'm not sure how much longer my VHS copy will last, but I'm not entirely pleased with it and recommend buyers take these things into consideration before excitedly purchasing like I did without looking into reviews/specifics of the DVD.",1242691200,11,1254,4.3008474576271185

302463,5,6300987787,"I felt the need to point out some stuff regarding the debate about the  different ratings for Johnny Got His Gun. I purchased the new 2009 DVD from Shout Factory with the PG rating, and I also own a version released on VHS from Media Home Entertainment that's rated R. They are NOT the same. First, the R version is 1 hour 51 minutes and the PG version is only 1 hour 46 minutes, making it approx. 5 minutes shorter. In the R version, Kareen's nudity isn't partial but in fact full frontal. After she hangs up her robe, we see her turn and face Joe, then walk to the bed, whereas in the PG version on the DVD they take this out, cutting to a close-up reaction shot of Joe watching her. This shot is in the R version as well, but as I said, there we also see what he's seeing. This is the most obvious trim in the PG version, but considering the difference in length, there are apparently more (the ""compassionate relief"" scene does appear to be in both versions, however). As others have suggested, given the importance of the subject matter, maybe the edits were made in hope of reaching a wider audience.
On the plus side, the DVD transfer is practically flawless, with a sharp, bright, clear image, compared with the poor VHS picture quality (although in a strange way, the soft, grainy picture of the VHS almost seems to fit the mood of the film more). Also, the bonus features on the DVD about the film's history are well worth the purchase price.
 The R version is worth seeking out to view Trumbo's complete vision, but rest assured the film's message remains the same in both versions. This is definitely a movie everyone should see.",1241654400,5,1641,4.430463576158941
302464,5,6300987787,"Some reviewers are confused on this film print used for shout factory's dvd presentation for ""Johnny Got His Gun"". The film is the exact same version as the R rated version(I had a vhs tape and region 2 dvd both rated R and the dvd for some reason said it's 116 min. long but it actually runs 1hr 46 min) so I don't know why there's a PG rating on the packaging,it must be a mistake unless if the movie rating standards are different today then they were back in 1971 when this film was originally released in theatres back then. Shout factory did an outstanding bang out job on this dvd presentation. The picture quality is excellent and it's in anamorphic widescreen. Versions i've seen in the past have had scratches on the film negative,you know when film negatives show their age over time, but not here I think there was digital restoration done for this presentation. On the Audio there is some very slight tape hiss in some areas but overall it is above average. You get some very nice special features that compliment the film and of course the video for Metallica's ""One"" along with some very insightful commentaries and interviews from Timothy Bottoms and producers.
 Some other reviewers on here have said they've seen versions of this movie with certain scenes cut but I guarantee to those reviewers that those specific scenes are all here on Shout Factory's presentation,bottom line this is an excellent dvd for this film with a strong statement that still withstands the test of time,and now it's preserved forever.",1241481600,4,1530,4.730337078651686

After reading previous reviews, I think there must have been a mistake on the packaging, because this couldn't be a PG version.  It has the scenes that would make it R--Kareen's partial nudity, the prostitute and the, for lack of a better phrase, ""compassionate relief"" scene with the nurse. The ""I'm the boss, this is champagne, Merry Chrismas"" scene is in there too, so if something was cut, I have no idea what it would be.

This is one of those films that clearly endures (I'm proof), and we need its message more than ever now.  Extras are phenomenal, too (Tim Bottoms looks great!). Kudos to Shout for digging it up and dusting it off!",1241136000,2,732,4.481203007518797
302466,5,6300987787,"After reading through all the commentary here on the Amazon forum I decided to rent this version before purchasing it, just to make sure I knew what I was getting.
I remember seeing this movie in its intact, original form, and it saddens me that this version, like so many others, has been edited, with several seconds noticably missing from several key scenes. As others who know have already commented, some of these scenes are present, but have been edited and visibly shortened, for god only knows why.
I decry any censorship in either the written or visual form that detracts from or lessons in any way the author or directors full intent. If something seriously offends me I alone reserve the right to stop reading or watching it. I do not need a censor from above to do this for me. Only god and those censors that made the cuts know their motives and rationale but IMO it shouldn't have happened.

For those of you who were fortunate enough to have taped the most intact version that was broadcast on cable a few years back (in the 1990's), treasure what you have as it is not likely that we will see the likes of such a complete showing again.
Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is scheduled to broadcast ""Johnny Got His Gun"" on the evening of July 15, 2009. I plan to record it but unless they have access to the original cable broadcast, mentioned above, I have my doubts that what I will see will differ from the ""Shout"" presentation.

That said, this ""Shout"" presentaion is probably the most intact version of this 1971 classic otherwise in extent. The quality of the DVD is excellent and the Bonus interviews and material are well worth the price of admission. For the excellent quality of the DVD and the efforts of Shout to deliver I give them cudos, and the movie is still worth 5 stars. Even in its abridged form it is still very powerful and only those of us that know better will miss what we are not seeing.

For those that can appreciate the movie, I strongly recommend the read as well. Both the book and the films screenplay and direction are by the same Dalton Trumbo, a controversial man in controversial times that sadly have changed so little over these many years.

My Original (April 13, 2009) query & commentary ""Could someone please tell us if this is the original, unedited version?"" Follows Below:

When I first saw this film in its original version it depicted, without actually showing, the horror of war through the memories of this hapless victim. And what was worse, the insensitivity of a medical community willing to do anything to keep ""Johnny"" alive, so long as they believed that he was mentally dead.
This movie, like the novel, has stuck with me many years, and when an opportunity to purchase an overpriced copy of it became available, I bought it, looking forward to seeing it again as I had remembered it. Sadly I was disappointed to discover that I had purchased an ""edited"" version of this fine film. Someone with ""god-like"" powers had deemed that one scene that I remember vividly, not because it was explicit, or pornographic, but because it was so human, should not be seen by the public, although the entire subject matter of the film is far more amoral. And just as the book was banned during WW 2 for its antiwar sentiments, so has this scene been banned, to protect us.
War and disfigurement is acceptable. Keeping a vegetable alive as an experiment is acceptable. But viewing a tender moment of compassion and human touch is evil and subject to corrupt the viewer. The scene I recall, that was not present in the version I purchased, depicted a young nurse, caring for ""Johnny."" He has no extremities, and no face, but apparently his manhood was somehow spared. During a bath, he must have had an erection and this nurse, with tears in her eyes, compassionately relieved him. This was not graphically illustrated, but the viewer understood what was happening. Johnny blesses her as the only human to treat him like a man in all the years since his injury. Her tender touch is the only bright experience he has to look forward to. It was this nurse who finally realized that Johnny was still a thinking human being, and learned that his head tapping was Morse code for ""please kill me."" When she compassionately tried to smother him, with Johnny blessing her all the while, she was stopped by her superiors before the mercy killing was complete and terminated. Johnny was stashed away, even deeper into the bowels of the hospital ""dungeon"" least someone else discover the inhumanity of his forced survival.
So here is the true pornography, that someone would not want us to see a scene that made the succeeding attempt at mercy killing so poignant. Johnny is left to be as forgotten as the forgotten war which took away all, except the man within the horribly injured shell.

When I pay good money for a movie or a book, I want to see what the author or director had originally intended, unedited and unabridged. I want to decide for myself what is worthy for me to view or not.
I would gladly purchase this DVD from Amazon, if I knew that it was intact and not edited in anyway from the original. So if someone has already purchased and viewed this current release, would you please enlighten us as to whether the scene which I described is present or not.
It is not an explicit scene and its subtleness could easily be overlooked, by everyone except the censor. But its presence lends power to this movie that contrasts inhumanity with humanity.

I cannot rate this current DVD since I have not seen it. As for the original uncut version, I would easily give it 5 stars.",1241049600,4,5623,4.605788423153693
302467,1,6300987787,"I saw this movie years ago, either on VHS, cable, or while I was at college, and it was a while after it was originally released at the movie theater. I seem to remember that the version I saw was rated R, so I'm assuming that that version was close to (or the same as) the official theatrical release. The version I saw was a masterpiece by any standards.

Now I may be totally wrong about this, but this DVD version from Shout Factory seems to be edited, censored, or whatever you want to call it. If it's been chopped up, then it's also a big disappointment, considering that this was an exceptionally fine motion picture in its original form. So what's the deal, Shout Factory - has this movie been edited in any way? If so, then are you guys going to release the original cut of the film, or is this what we have to live with?

P.S. I rented this movie first from a local video rental outfit. If anyone has a copy of (or vividly remembers seeing) an uncut version, I'd be interested in reading your opinions about this re-release. Personally I'm going to wait and see before I put out good money for this DVD. Totally unacceptable.",1240876800,5,1136,4.35377358490566

Is there an all region release that might be more complete?",1240876800,,375,4.081081081081081
302469,5,6300987787,"I am overjoyed ""Johnny Got His Gun"" is finally on DVD. Like the other reviewers, I key into the moment I got the book, saw the movie. A battered Bantam edition with a cover painting vaguely screaming, then intensely burning into my eyes when I realized in that dark store what I was seeing--a used book store--a dark cold November late afternoon-the first war novel I bought, because of that front cover of hell and the resounding review blurbs from all over the world on the back and inside. I read it Friday night. I was in UT. I have never been more shaken in my life. I had nightmares that night that Joe was on my attic steps trying to weep and having no eyes or face. The putting away when discovered, the shame of it, and far too often the truth is hidden, until it is too late.

When the movie came out, I saw it in Memphis one hot Saturday afternoon. I was astounded that an ""unfilmable"" novel was filmed. As has been said, the beauty, the passion, the sheer incredible urgency of Dalton Trumbo's words could not be conveyed, yet it is unforgettable. I wrote endlessly about both for my university newspaper. I wanted to scream on housetops, read this book, see this film.

Timothy Bottoms was superb as Joe. His dreams, his nightmares, his dad, his mom, his girl, even Christ mingle and slip away and try to help or say stay far from me, and his gradual knowing piece by piece what has happened to him. ""Oh Joe, put your two strong arms around me. Oh Joe, don't go.  You won't come back."" To the angry roar of the crowds and of the train ready for hell and the pompous patriotic speeches screamed in the background, all of it a series of horrors, a bid for love, a nurse's kindness, and the utter tragedy, for this is the face of war, Joe says to himself, everyone must see me, SOS SOS SOS

It is the most powerful book I have ever read and re-read, and one of the most powerful movies. Part of the genius of them is focusing on one soldier, few battle scenes, taking us into the mind of  a man as dead as dead can be and who horribly is aware and thinks. The sheer rapture of Joe's becoming able to count the days, to know it is Christmas morning, to dream he is whole and young and free as he falls into glorious summer grass on a blue sky day.

One of the greats. A book and a movie needed right this second. Somehow Dalton Trumbo wrote from inside the mind of a man so destroyed. Somehow he made it into a movie. I wish to climb again to the house tops and scream see this movie, read this book. It is so heartening to read the reviews--and how such power and such love of life Dalton Trumbo created is remembered and still loved. That's the thing of it. Joe on my attic steps, trying to cry, but having no face or eyes. That is the thing.",1240876800,2,2753,4.214421252371917
302470,4,6300987787,"Everything the previous 2 reviewers say about this film is true.  It's one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made.  I saw it in the 1970's when it was released theatrically.  I have vivid memories of it today.  There's no question I was deeply moved and the intense images were burned into my psyche.  But, be warned.  I also remember it being the single most depressing film I've ever seen.  In fact, that's my strongest memory of this challenging work.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy great dramas, even the unhappy ones.  But this story is filled with such utter despair and hopelessness that it sent me into a profound state of depression.  So, if you have a difficult time with exceedingly sad content, you should probably steer clear of this film.",1240358400,,761,4.611940298507463
302527,5,6300987787,"In 1971 I was 17, and a budding ""hippie"" with anti-war leanings and a rebel streak a mile long.  While riding the NYC subway to work one day, I noticed a young man about my age absorbed in a book as he rode next to me.  The title of the book was Johnny Got His Gun.  ""Probably some right-wing adolescent shoot-`em-up war epic"", I thought to myself, dismissing the teen and his book from my mind.  A few weeks later, I read an article in the newspaper that a film was being made of the book Johnny Got His Gun, and I was instantly embarrassed at my previous assumption of the book's subject matter when I read that Johnny Got His Gun was actually a pacifist anti-war classic, and that its author, Dalton Trumbo, had been blacklisted as a communist during the 1950's.  A few days later, I ran across the book in my favorite bookstore, and picked it up almost without thinking.

I was immediately blown away by the intense imagery of the narrative's storyline.  Joe Bonham, an 18-year old soldier, is hit by a bombshell on the last day of WWI, and awakes in a hospital bed horribly deformed.  Unable to speak, see, hear, or smell, he gradually learns that his arms and legs have been amputated.  As the horror of his situation unfolds in a stream-of-consciousness first person narrative, he slowly realizes that the bomb shell that hit him scooped out his face, leaving a gaping hole where his eyes, ears, nose and mouth used to be.  The army doctors automatically assume he is a thoughtless vegetable, and in an experimental effort to see if they can keep someone in his condition alive, he spends the next several years in a hospital bed, well cared-for but practically forgotten.  Joe is constantly thinking but unable to communicate.  Deprived of all senses, except feelings and thoughts, his story movingly unfolds, and I was forever transformed by the beauty of Mr. Trumbo's story-telling ability and the terror-filled description of Joe's situation.  He spends his days remembering the details of his young life, while struggling to overcome the inability to discern his conscious thoughts from his nightmares.  As I waited for the film's premiere, I must have read and re-read the book a half dozen times, and 38 years later, portions of the powerful book still stick with me.

I saw the film on opening day in an art house on the east side of Manhattan, and although I was slightly disappointed by the movie's inability to project the author's hauntingly beautiful prose onto the screen, the story has remained a favorite of mine ever since.  I recall that the film got lukewarm reviews, but I remember urging all of my friends to see it and experience it for themselves.  I also remember a review by Rex Reed, then one of the top film critics in NY.  In describing the scene where Joe finally manages to communicate with a nurse the fact that he has conscious thoughts, Mr. Reed said that that scene alone contained more tenderness than the entire film ""Love Story"" (which was then a current smash hit).  I was also bitterly disappointed that the film did not get more attention.

Recently I learned that an all-region DVD of the film was available from Portugal, and I gladly paid Amazon the import price of the DVD.  I also obtained a new copy of the book, and found to my delight that the story had lost none of its impact after 38 years.  Why should it?  The book was first published in 1939, and when I first discovered it 32 years later, I found it fresh, vibrant and surprisingly topical.

Apparently due the fact that a stage version (and a DVD of the stage version) is getting quite a bit of attention, the powers that be have finally decided to release this forgotten gem.  I will now order the new DVD as well.

Although the film is slightly dated, I heartily recommend it for its unforgettable storyline.  I also recommend that anyone who enjoys it check out the novel; Mr. Trumbo's masterpiece is every bit as compelling as any film version could ever be.",1234137600,58,3975,4.609375
302528,4,6300987787,"I bought this movie for a friend of mine and watched it before I gave it to him.  He told me I could.  He said it changed his life, so was interested to see it.  It sure makes you think about life itself.  This poor young man was trapped in a body that could not respond in any way to people around him, yet he knew everything that was going on and all conversation.  It sure lets you know the kind of terrible tragedies that happen to those who are in the service and sustain injuries so debilitating and have to live this way for the rest of their lives.  We take for granted our freedom while others fight to preserve it.  It has helped me want to be more willing to give to causes that need help because of services provided by those willing to give their lives in our behalf.",1230422400,,780,4.092105263157895

Also the text on the DVD BOX is in Portuguese, as well as the menu. But the the film is in English.

This movie may never see the light of day because of its story. It's about a soldier in WWI that gets blown to pieces and lays in a hospital bed. The entire film you have WAVE after WAVE of emotion. You learn the back story of this soldier as well as what is happening. The back story is in Color while the present is in Black and White.

After seeing this movie, I truly recommend that you pick up the Novel of this outstanding story. and the writer directed this movie.

Now there is another movie that just came out recently and it's the PLAY VERSION of this story. And from what I have read from Imdb.com It's not all what this version is.

""Landmine, has taken my sight...taken my speech...taken my hearing
taken my arms...taken my legs...taken my soul...
Left me with a life in hell.""

Clips of this movie appear on Metallica's video ""One"".  The magnitude of these devastating injuries is impossible to comprehend.  The soldier can't decipher his reality from his nightmares.  He is kept alive, slowly going mad, just for the doctors to study for future cases.
I really love how this movie was shot, using B&W film for the soldiers day to day suffering, and color sequences to pull you inside his memories, nightmares, and subconscious.  At moments you'll also feel trapped inside this surreal sort of desperation.

302531,5,6300987787,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's about a young American soldier named Johnny who gets hit by a shell on the last day of the First World War. Johnny lies in a hospital bed, a quadruple amputee who has lost his eyes, ears, mouth and nose. His only means of communication is by banging his head against his pillow.  As the movie progresses you get inside Johnny's head by means of a series of flashbacks and fantasy sequences. We learn about Johnny's failed shoe salesman father, his first, and last night with the woman he loves, his pre war job in the local bakery. I was so moved by the nurse in the movie. She finds a way to communicate with Johnny and her kindness to him should inspire us all. So, what's this movie all about? Well it's a damning indictment of war, obviously, and a strange one at that. But it's also a metaphysical examination of what it is to be human. The absence of limbs and features in no way extinguishes Johnny's imperishable humanity and in this case the mind definitely rules the body rather than vice versa. Bizarrely, the story is based on real events, and while this kind of truth is usually too strange to be turned into fiction, the director successfully turns Johnny into the living embodiment of the horror of war,but also of the unquenchable resilience of the human spirit. This is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it if you are someone who likes to watch movies where when you are done watching it the story stays in your mind and has a high impact on you.",1187136000,3,1522,4.4163701067615655
302532,5,6300987787,"I know that the title of this review may seem strange , but here is what I mean. More than an attack on war this story is an attack on what we sometimes do in the name of life. The doctors in the movie all think they are doing something great keeping this ""living meat"" alive to study, never even thinking that this ""hunk of meat"" might be a thinking living person. The story is really a horror of the first order as we learn that this ""lump"" is alive, thinking and knows that he is doomed and wants to die but they won't let him. This is a very good , but flawed film that should be seen. That said it is such a downer(the last shot is just heartbreaking) that to watch this one more than once a year(if that often) is to invite a nightmares of the worst kind.

There is a brief scene in the band's Long Version of the Music Video where the protaganist, as a young boy, asks his Father, ""What is Democracy?""  This is pre-WWI.  The Father, John Huston, I think, mumbles something like, ""It's got something to do with young men killing each other, I think.""  I made sure my kids watched that video, back inna day...

The cover is, for me, thought provoking in a way.  That Peace sign, the split fingers.  That sign has it's roots in the 15th century, you know, The 100 Years War.  At the Battle of Agincourt, the French cut the middle fingers off of Welsh Archers that they had captured.  After that, the Longbowmen would show that they still had their fingers by flashing, what later became, the Peace sign.

  A few years ago, my now grown son joined the Army, right out of College.  He sent me a great picture of him taking a break on a training march...serreptitiously flashing the Peace sign.

If you can't see the movie, go pick up a Metallica CD called ""And Justice For All"".  You never know.  It could be life altering.  Give Heavy Metal a chance.

302571,4,6300987787,"Personally, I enjoyed the movie a lot.  It clearly illustrated the horrible nature of war and the negative effects it can have on individuals who fight for their countries.  The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that it is somewhat slow paced.  It is a sad and depressing movie, but war is not exactly a happy topic anyway.  The movie differs slightly from the book (although it was directed by Dalton Trumbo who wrote the book).  In my opinion the book is almost always better than the movie, such is true in this case.  I highly recommend watching this movie, but only if you have the patience to sit through a slower paced film.",1122422400,4,649,4.411764705882353

302573,4,6300987787,"The figure of horrifically wounded soldier Joe Bonham literally haunted my nightmares after just seeing the clips from this film in Metallica's ""One"" video when I was younger.  I have since been moved and quite changed by seeing the full film, reading Trumbo's novel (several times), and experiencing the little-known stage adaptation by Bradley Rand Smith.  Trumbo's novel is required reading for anyone interested in war literature.  There is no story like the story of Joe Bonham, a boy who has, as literally as one can state it, lost everything by blindly participating in a war he never understood.  The film, book, and play are staunchly anti-war and may come across overly didactic (even unneccessarily so) at times, but the subject of these great pieces of art is Joe himself.  It is ultimately a story about life, about how far the human spirit can be pushed and about the absolutely senseless reasons we destroy ourselves and each other.  For me, the film is a little messy, in comparison to the book and play, but all three together really get the point across.  If you're interested in learning more about the play (which Amazon doesn't carry - and should!), check out the website I've included.

302578,4,6300987787,"This is a significant film that has reached cult status. Dalton Trumbo wrote the novel in 1938, won the National Book Award, and then the book was banned as subversive. Trumbo suffered a polemic from HUAC in 1949, and spent a year in jail for contempt of congress. The book was banned again in 1950, during the Korean War. Kirk Douglas brought him out of exile in 1960 to write the screenplay for SPARTACUS. In 1970, Trumbo directed this film himself, adapted from his own book, and it emerged as a scathing anti-war allegory. When the film opened, it did poorly at the box office in America. The Viet Nam war had clouded the issue. Perhaps if he had included more humor and satire in the picture it would have been easier to digest. Watching it is like drinking white lightning; it burns all the way down.

 In 1989, the rock group Metallica released a 7 minute video called TWO OF ONE, and it did use clips from this film. This helped to generate more interest in the movie. The cinematography was above average, done by Jules Brenner, nicely blending B&W, sepia, and full color scenes.

 We are introduced in the opening scene to a group of doctors discussing a decerebrated patient, a grievously wounded soldier, assumed to be brain dead; incapable of sentience or dreams; just an armless, legless, faceless, totally deaf living chunk of meat with a beating heart and an active colon. But we soon hear the soldier's voice, and realize he is aware of his environment.

 Timothy Bottoms, in his film debut, played the young soldier, Joe Bonham. He did an exceptional job with the voice over work, and we get to see him in the flesh in flashbacks; even the moment he crouched in the trenches, readying himself for his rendezvous with the howitzer shell that had his name on it. There were some rough spots in his acting, but overall he was fine as the fresh-faced naive Joe. Jason Robards played the father, and he underplayed brilliantly. He was a terrific actor, who could bray and strut like in A THOUSAND CLOWNS, or he could quietly inhabit a role like he did in this film. Kathy Fields did a credible job as Joe's sweetheart, Kareen. Charles McGraw was wonderfully gruff, yet compassionate at Kareen's Dad. Eduard Franz, a skilled character actor, played the pivotal role of General Tillery, the doctor that had spared Joe's life, such as it was. Donald Sutherland played Christ, looking every inch both the hippy and the savoir. His scenes gave us a humorous take on death and war. Trumbo should have paid more attention to this level of satire. It might have made this movie more popular to the audiences of 1971.

 Diane Varsi was outstanding as the fourth Nurse. She found a way to share her love of humanity with what was left of Joe. Her willingness to see him as a human being, to open windows, to sponge bathe him, even masturbate him, showed a level of compassion unrivaled in the piece. It was she that figured out Joe's incessant head movements were important. They turned out to be Morse code. Joe found a way to commlunicate with his doctors.

 He asked to be allowed to be around other people, even to be given over to a carnival if necessary. He was tired of being alone. If they would not do this, then they should kill him. It was a chilling scene indeed, when shame, guilt, and cowardice washed over the medical assemblage. They fled quickly, exiling Nurse Varsi from the room, turned their backs on him, leaving him alone and drugged in the darkness and the complete silence, in the hellish limbo of the land of the living dead.

 I liked this film a lot, more for its message than its content. As TV Guide put it, the movie was,""flawed but powerful."" This film has sturdy teeth, and it bites through much of the traditional dogma, propaganda, and lies that politicians force-feed us eternally. It teaches us that blind patriotism can lead us into dark events, whereby the powers that be will be able to manipulate or sacrifice our life or limb on the alter of their choosing. It teaches us further that freedom, liberty, and democracy can be reduced to buzz words that can mantle the real issues. We come to realize that, in fact, there are worse things in this world than death.",1091577600,100,4205,4.599465954606141
302579,5,6300987787,"When I was young, the heavy metal group Metallica released a video entitled ""One"".  A child at the time, I remember seeing black and white images of a man who appeared to be wearing a nurse's mask, and hearing narration.  Later on, seeing the video a few times, I realized what it was about, who this man was, and the general plotline.  I was so simultaneously horrified, depressed, and abysmally aware that this COULD happen and probably had happen that I thought about it for days.  I even feared, for a time, turning on MTV for fear of seeing the video again.  It stuck in my mind like morbid superglue.
Finding out more about ""Johnny Got His Gun"" as novel, I was almost terrified to touch the book, but soon couldn't resist anymore.  The impact of the novel on my mind was indescribable.  Although I had no intention whatsoever of seeing the film (the book, in it's depth, sincerity, hopelessness and painstaking attention to gruesome detail had overwhelmed me), I promised myself that one day I would.
I did.  While it doesn't approach the power of the novel, it is a film like no other.  I have never once seen a plot this bleak and ""in your face"" in terms of anti war, matters of human dignity and just bare suffering ever.  It made my stomach turn, heart leap and etched in my memory.  The scenes where Joe talks to an obviously illusory Christ are surreal and disturbing.  This is bar none the most powerful anti-war film, and one (if not the) powerful films I have ever seen.  I am not surprised at it's obscurity, as few would even want to see it.  Brilliant, breathtaking, and absolutely devastating.  If you're up for a challenge and a mind blower, watch this straight through with no breaks.",1085788800,23,1705,4.5442622950819676

302626,5,6300987787,"I haven't read the book, but I knew the basic plot outline and so when I saw this film, I expected very strong anti-war sentiments to be pervasive throughout the movie. However, even though the main character loses his arms, legs, face and four of his five senses to a mortar in World War I, not a drop of blood is shown in the movie and the film's indictment of the institution of war seems to take a backseat to the young soldier's struggle to adapt to his dark, silent and motionless environment.
I was hesitant to watch this film at first because I thought it would be dull to watch a two-hour movie concerning a horribly maimed young man lying in bed. However, due to his unique condition of being connected to this world only through his sense of touch, I found it fascinating how he first struggles to distinguish his dreams from his reality, and after that tries puts his energy toward discerning the passage of time.
The movie includes a number of dream sequences, which to a man deprived of sight, sound, smell and taste, must certainly at least rival anything that happens during his waking hours in importance. The numerous dream sequences serve to explain his past and shed light on his values. Some of them are quite surreal, some are unhappy while some are fairly humorous.
The ending is grim and the man's predicament is left unresolved, which leaves the viewer to fill in some of the blanks, but this invites the viewer to give the movie some thought after seeing it, and I by no means felt that the movie was left so open-ended that I felt like I had been shortchanged.

I'm unsure why this was?

Perhaps the grotesquery and horror of war can never truly be captured on film?? One can only engage surreptitiously at best in any film. We cringe from violence and the sorrow wrought of war. However, perhaps this is too individual a thing to ever be universal.
