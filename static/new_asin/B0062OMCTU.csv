4933273,4,B0062OMCTU,It was nice to have all 3 of these movies in one set. I really enjoyed Home alone part 1 and 2 as a child and now my kids can have them and watch them whenever they want. The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is because I don't enjoy part 3 as much as the first 2 movies because of the different kid they use in part 3 and because I didn't think it was as funny as the first 2.,1387756800,,384,3.5294117647058822
