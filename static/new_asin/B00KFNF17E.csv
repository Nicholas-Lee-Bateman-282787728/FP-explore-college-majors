6424284,4,B00KFNF17E,"The movie was based on the book by VC. Andrews. There are 5 books, ""Flowers in the Attic"", ""Petals on the Wind"", ""If there be Thorns"", ""Seeds of Yesterday"" and the prequel, ""Gardens of the Shadows. ""Petals on the Wind"" is the second book. The movie is not exactly like the book, but close enough. The book ""Petals on the Wind"", picks up from where the children leave the attic and the family home.. The movie begins 10 years after the children leave the attic. The movie is about 3 children, Cathy, Chris, Carrie, who escaped from a horrible situation. Cathy, the dancer is strong, forceful and determined to get justice. Chris, the doctor is silent, handsome and devoted to Cathy. Carrie is sweet, needy and confused. They find a better life and careers at the home of a caring stranger, but they can never forget the past. They fight forbidden feelings, guilt, deep anger and unending pain. Cathy vows to destroy the mother, who threw them away. The movie had action, lust, hate and revenge. The movie does contain SEXUAL  situations between blood relatives. The movie is rushed and chapters of the book are skipped in order to make the 2 hour timeline, but I liked it""",1401148800,32,1171,4.6298076923076925

6424348,1,B00KFNF17E,"This adaptation of the book was so off the mark that I don't even know how they can call it ""Petals on the Wind"".  This book was probably my favorite in the series and this movie did not do it justice at all.  The fact that it picks up ten years after the kids run away from the attic was the first major ""what?"" moment for me.  It starts off at Paul's funeral.  He died at the end of the book and he was a major character in the whole book.  Just really weird that they would do that.  Why even make a movie at all if it is going to be so different than the book?  The three kids stay on at Paul's house because apparently he left it to them.  Henny is there and she can speak for some reason and doesn't pass away in the movie.

Carrie is in her private school and getting picked on by other girls for what reason?  The actress who played Carrie was very pretty and not really strikingly short like she was in the book.  In fact, the movie never really acknowledged why she was getting picked on. Chris has a long term girlfriend in the movie.  Cathy is probably 25 throughout the whole movie and was she just sitting at Rosencoff ballet school for 10 years waiting to get a break?  That wasn't explained.  Madame Marisha was an afterthought and Georges wasn't in the movie.  Julian just randomly shows up and the actor did an okay job portraying him but it didn't explain why he was so unstable, he just came off as a total brute.  Cathy didn't know him at all and just went to New York and moved in with him.  In the book she already knew him for a few years, graduated high school, then went on to New York.  Madame Zolta didn't exist in the movie.

The whole thing about Julian dying was just implied.  He and Cathy got in a car crash (she wasn't in the car in the book, she was at home after Julian broke her toes) and showed him laying on the pavement - cut to 10 months later.  I don't like how swiftly they sped through Carrie's death.  Then after that Cathy quickly seduces Bart and there was no passion or hatred or anything between both of them.  Cathy gets knocked up by Bart right away, there wasn't must passage of time in this movie, so that made Jory and Bart Jr. only a year apart in age where as in the book they were 4 or 5 years apart.

When Cathy confronts the grandmother, she'd had a stroke but she could talk.  That whole scene was okay but what happened in the book was way more extreme, after all, Cathy went there to get revenge!  The end party scene was pretty anti-climatic, and again, it was just implied that Bart died in the fire.  I wouldn't watch this movie again.  It is impossible to try to cram a 400 page book into 90 minutes and they didn't really even stick to the plot.",1469318400,2,2712,4.133843212237093

I don't know what they were aiming to achieve by changing so much...certainly they couldn't have hoped to improve on the already stellar story lines V.C. Andrews wrote.

6424386,3,B00KFNF17E,"Here be spoilers.

Been a long time since I read the book so I went into the movie prepared to judge it on its own merits. However, its merits being slim I guess it does no harm to make the comparison. The casting of Cathy and Chris was spot on, in physical appearance as well as chemistry. In the spirit of the source material they did a great job inducing a twinge or two of angst and heartache over their apparently tragic emotional predicament. Aside from their relationship, it was hard to like Cathy as a person at times and I have to wonder what her brother would think of her if he knew about the glass in the rival ballerina's shoe incident. I don't recall disliking book-Cathy but I haven't read the book in about 20 years. Back then I didn't realise I was reading trashy melodrama, delicious though it was.

A writer has every right to be in love with her hero, as VC Andrews clearly was, and it was no difficult task to make Chris likeable. The scriptwriter, on the other hand, did have an annoying tendency to put Chris in several scenes while giving him no lines (he was easy on the eye so there's that). Carrie was also well written and well played.

I felt the movie failed to address a major theme of the book, that Cathy and Chris defied the odds and became the prima ballerina and superstar doctor they always dreamed of being, in spite of their shocking childhood. Those dreams helped keep them alive in the attic. Their successes here came across as rather lukewarm. Carrie's demise would have benefitted from a voiceover of her suicide note, which I recall almost word-for-word from the book after all these years. It would've nicely summed up her story given that the movie had little time to do it justice.

I don't care that they glossed over the somewhat creepy Paul storyline. Chris's fiance was a new character and I didn't mind that addition - he was shown to make a fairly genuine attempt to get over Cathy, even if it did require liquid courage. Think about it, he's the only character who gets a happy ending (well, other than his actual ending, I suppose, but I hear it's quick and painless).

Overall, it's a 2-star movie that I am bumping up a notch because of the few moments of 4-star goodness.",1455667200,,2231,4.458333333333333

Henny can talk and yes most annoying of all Cathy the steel determined ballerina is a weak and honestly silly woman.

Now in spite of all these i still really enjoyed the film. It was sad and captured the essence of the book, Cathy and Chris' enduring inescapable love for one another, Carrie's haunting inability to escape from the trauma of the attic, and Corrine's degeneration to insanity..

6424438,4,B00KFNF17E,"Petals in the Wind starts in the year 1970, supposedly 10 years since the events of Flowers in the Attic.  Since Flowers in the Attic was set in the 1950s this doesn't entirely make sense, but you can live with it.  I would have liked the film to have included the events that happened in those ten years though as we the viewer are just plonked into a funeral for a rich doctor who we are told took the kids in and raised them as his own.  Later we find out that Cathy was pregnant and had a miscarriage with Christopher's kid (both played by different actors than the first film), so there's obviously a lot of interesting stuff we never saw happen, such as how they found this guy to live with in the first place, as well as dealing with the trauma from what went on in the first film.  Did they think about going to the authorities for one?  Anyway we join the lives of the three kids with the youngest still in high school where she is picked on by two mean girls, for some reason she doesn't think she is attractive even though she is way hotter than any of her classmates, and still carries her doll that she took with her from the first movie that her mother gave her.  Christopher is finishing some sort of Scrubs style hospital internship and Cathy is a ballet dancer, where she will be about to meet a man who will bring on a new violent world for her to deal with.  Christopher is jealous that Cathy is starting at other men the way he looks at her.

Ellen Burstyn has probably about five minutes of screen time all together in this sequel, she never looks like she does on the cover of the DVD which is a still taken from the Flowers in the Attic cover anyway.  She does a good job but most of her acting is from a bed looking like she does at the end of Attic.  Heather Graham has about ten minutes total of screen time, mostly spent either being nasty to Burstyn or being nasty to architects renovating the mansion.  It's only due to the other actors being unfamous that these two's names dominate the DVD cover and their images are centre and larger than the actor and actress playing the two main characters.

Like the first, this is a made for TV movie and the low budget does show at times, there's a shot inside a car where it is obvious there is a green screen behind the windows and the car is not really moving for example. Although you probably don't need to have seen Flowers in the Attic the plot does build upon the unnatural type of love between a brother and sister which was a heavy part of that book and a briefly touched on in the movie. Odd that if they were going to make this sequel that it wasn't touched on much in the first movie.  Petals on the Wind is a tale of the aftermath of evil done to children and ends as a classic revenge type story.  It was better than the original film simply because it was prepared to tackle a subject they were obviously reluctant to do in the first.  The acting is probably midday soap opera level at best, but still Petals on the Wind is worth giving a look.",1440633600,,3031,4.210708117443868

6424542,5,B00KFNF17E,"Wow. That was my reaction to the end of this movie, that ending scene with Corrine was chilling. Okay let me petal backwards here. This was a great adaption of the second novel in the series. There were a few changes however and they are the following: 1. Paul is taken out of the movie entirely when in the book he was a major character throughout.  2. Julian's back story with his parents isn't delved into like in the book.  3. Olivia or ""The grandmother"" can actually speak and has dialogue in the movie where as in the book she can't talk.  Those are the major changes I noticed but it didn't effect the movie badly at all I thought and plus they are trying to get a 500 page book into 90 minutes and I think they did a pretty damn good job considering what they had to work with. Now the acting...I thought the acting in the movie was quite good. I thought everyone nailed their parts especially the one who played Julian. I was much more impressed with the actress who played Cathy this time around, the actress who played Carrie did an excellent job in playing the disturbed Carrie(sorry I don't know most of the actors' names), and Ellen Burstyn was amazing as always as Olivia. But Heather Graham really impressed me. I thought she was good in the first one but she really steps up her game here and like I said in the beginning that final scene with Corrine was freakin bone-chilling, my jaw dropped, amazing Job Heather! Wyatt Nash as Chris was good, a bit robotic at certain moments, but still good, I think I liked the other actor a bit better though. So overall, great adaption, great acting, a very good movie and better than the first one. Also has an amazing cliff hanger.",1429488000,,1690,4.410256410256411

There are so many things wrong with this movie that I do not know where to begin. First of all, Paul was NOT dead! Cathy did stuff with him and that wasn't in the movie. Carrie didn't just die, she talked to Cathy before she died, and Chris NEVER was about to get married. I cannot BELIEVE I didn't listen to the people who warned me not to get this. I learned my lesson. Flowers In The Attic was at least OKAY, but this one was not good.

6424620,4,B00KFNF17E,"I eagerly got this sequel from Netfilx after seeing the previous Flowers in the Attic updated version.  I am also happy to see that someone is undertaking that the entire series is going to be made into TV movies.  This was, as many know, more over the top that Flowers was, and Flowers was scandalous as is.  The acting was good (and very much so by Heather Graham as the mother Corrine), but the only criticism is that the story was a bit on the choppy side.  However, the original was also choppy and unbelievable, so that's what they had to work with.

It is ten years after the three kids escaped the attic of their grandmother's house and iron fist and have been abandoned by their mother, Corrine, who has skipped off to live with her new husband, Bart.  Cathy has begun her ballet career, Chris is in medical school, and youngest sister Carrie is enrolled in a private girls school.  They all have their demons to deal with, Carrie's addition to being pushed around in high school is the obvious appeal to the high school / teenage set that these books were aimed at.  Cathy and Chris, of course, are dealing with the fact that they once slept together (albeit it was a rape) in the attic one fateful night during their imprisonment despite their being brother and sister.  Chris says that he could never love anyone else but Cathy, and Cathy says that he must forget her and move on.  As well as the baby she miscarried which she never mentioned until now.  They try, oh how they try, but they cannot forget one another.  Chris attempts to date other women, Cathy's attempts to date other men go a bit haywire to say the least.  Cathy goes to New York with a guy named Julian who is suffering from some kind of break down or some nonsense who becomes jealous and possessive.  Conveniently enough he is killed in a car accident and Cathy returns with a son she had by him, Jory.  Then Cathy meets up with Bart, her mother's husband, and out of spite decides to begin an affair with him as well to hurt her mother Corrine.  In the meantime, Chris's career falls apart because he and Cathy were caught in a passionate embrace by his former fiance, Sarah, Corrine looses it, and Cathy and Chris move away and decide to start their rather hilariously dysfunctional family afresh far away from their relatives who have caused such pain.  And six years later, Cathy and Chris are living happily in California with their children, the envy of all those around them as they look ""so perfect"".

Oi ...  You couldn't make this up, oh wait, you did.  What does this tell you?  That we are going to follow the examples of our parents and become them in some way?  We could and chances are, we will.  Will we ever truly break the cycle be it good or bad?  We can, but that person is few and far between, and there is only so much we can hide, so much we can avoid, so much we can deny, and what all that hiding, avoiding and denying can and will do to a person.  I commend this movie for attempting to put this on film when it was such a difficult subject matter to tackle and a crazy story that goes in a million directions at once to end up in a situation.",1425081600,,3153,4.348717948717948

6424644,2,B00KFNF17E,"First, I read the book first so I'm doing a two-part review.

The movie alone:

Although I am biased by knowing the original story, I did feel the movie was only a 3-star film. It moved really quickly through the main events and I would have liked them to be explained a little more throughout. It was a rushed movie with many ""years later"" sections and I think, had I not read the book first, I would have been lost.

Now, for those who have read the book:

Not like the book! For this part, I'd give the movie a 1-star review. I completely understand needing to leave parts of the story out in order to fit the story into a film (though really, it should have been longer than 90 minutes) but the directors changed and added so much, it doesn't even feel like the right story. I felt that Cathy's character was weaker in the movie than in the book and I didn't like her as much, though they did give her a little fire towards the end.

Things that were different (SPOILERS):
1. Henny is not deaf.
2. Paul's funeral is the opening, so he doesn't even have a speaking part! He played a huge role throughout the story, so I was baffled to see them kill off his character before he even made an entrance.
3. Julian just seemed thrown in only for Cathy to have Jory. He was so naturally introduced in the novel that by the time he married Cathy, I was really on the fence on whether to hate or love him. In the movie, I just hated him for being the abusive guy Cathy ran to. Oh, and they threw in a ""let's put glass in another dancer's shoes so Cathy can have the main role"" and didn't give her talent any real focus. They made it seem like she only got roles in thanks to Julian, when really she held her own on stage.
4. When Julian is in the wreck, Cathy is in the car with him (which is when she announces her pregnancy), and from the wreck scene it jumps forward to after Jory is born with no mention of suicide.
5. The one good change was having more of Corrine included, mostly because Heather Graham is so phenomenal at playing her role, by far the best actress in the films (other than the grandmother).
6. And speaking of the grandmother, she has quite a few speaking roles. That's right--she's not completely bedridden and silent at all. Which actually I loved most of her lines so I also didn't actually mind this as much.
7. The final ""plan"" of Cathy's also looked like less of a plan in the film. It almost makes it seem like her pregnancy wasn't planned and she takes advantage of the situation. Her relationship with dear old stepdad was also more on the romantic side than the cat and mouse game in the book.
8. Because of the jumping around and not having the background of Cathy's thoughts coupled with her being less of a spit fire, the scenes of Cathy and Chris, then Cathy and Julian and then Cathy and Bart were really close together and made her seem a little whorish in comparison to the book.

(SPOILERS OVER)

And the list goes on and on. It may not be as bad for someone who hasn't recently read the book or someone who hasn't read the book at all, but my advice would be to watch it for free if you can just to experience the superior acting skills of Heather Graham and make sure to read the book.",1420675200,4,3224,4.224025974025974

6424683,5,B00KFNF17E,"This was surprisingly accurate.
They did leave out a few things.
They changed a few things too.
Henny died.
Henny did not leave them. Henny died.
If they didn't want to add the stroke scene.
She could have just died in her sleep or something.
That's what made me mad.
Then...this doesn't really have anything to do with the movie but I despised the name Jory.
Jory is a terrible name. Call you kid Julian or Cory. DONT CALL HIM JORY!
Christopher gets a girlfriend. Again not in book.
 Then. . . They left out Madame Zolta (I think that's her name) She was sort of  jerk but she deserved to be included.
At that part when *spoilers* Julian puts glass in Yolanda's shoes. That was stupid. It made Cathy look like a sore loser. Why couldn't she just have been smoking pot like in the books?
Then they just left in the middle of the performance!!!?! I hope their understudies were there.
Cathy was not in the car when Julian was crippled. Yolanda was. Yolanda died. Julian was crippled. He did not die. He was crippled. Madame Marsha made him feel the need to kill himself.
Anyway. Besides all of that and some other stuff I probably or accidentally left out. This was a pretty good movie. The ending was my favorite part. I really wish they'd have taken Cory's body with them. They forgot how Corrine screamed for Bart to go get her mother. She killed him. Olivia did not deserve to die that way. But the end was the best part. When Corrine is screaming in the mental asylum. That acting was the best.  I cant wait for Garden of shadows :)",1412640000,2,1536,4.382456140350877

6424692,5,B00KFNF17E,"Lifetime's adaptation of the second novel in V.C. Andrews' Dollanganger Saga is not a disappointment.

Paring down a nearly 500 page epic revenge drama into 90 minutes of television is no easy task, but screenwriter Kayla Alpert does a fine job of this nearly impossible endeavor. Petals on the Wind is quite possibly V. C. Andrews' most complex and ambitious novel, it covers close to 20 years of time, encompasses several major events, marriages, births, deaths, confrontations, and revelations. All of the characters, including the minor ones, are complicated and have fairly extensive backstories and interesting idiosyncrasies. Ms. Alpert incorporates as much of all of that as humanly possible in the allotted time and as a result the film moves at a breakneck pace, one major plot point after another before you know what's hit you. That can be seen as a hindrance by some, or a good thing by others. For me it was neither here nor there, the fast pace didn't bother me.

What was necessary to happen, in order for the remainder of the novels to be adaptable, happens. What NEEDS to be covered is covered, some things are expanded upon that are merely hinted at in the novel (Chris's relationships while at school, Cory's remains, etc.) and in my opinion that was a nice touch. Although Ellen Burstyn's character is rendered immobile and incapable of speech in the novel, in the film she has regained the ability to speak...and as a result we get some fantastically morbid moments and effective dialogue that actually adds to the overall vibe of the picture. I was pleasantly surprised, and loved the twist that the Grandmother and Cathy were actually, unintentionally, working in tandem to bring Corrine down, it was a nice touch as well that had me nearly cheering at the screen when Burstyn states in front of the Christmas party guests, ""Oh Corrine dear, I don't think anyone is interested in the rantings of an old woman."" Ha!

I was also extremely pleased with the amount of screen time that Bailey Buntain's Carrie got. It's so important and emotional in the book, and she really NAILS the part perfectly.

The casting is perfection, the acting is solid (Heather Graham is VERY good this time around), and the pacing exciting.

My only two criticisms? One, being the cheesy fade-outs to commercial. Nothing screams ""Cheap TV Movie of the Week"" like fade-outs to commercial. I REALLY hope they return to the sharp cuts used in Flowers in the Attic in the next film If There Be Thorns...they create a feeling of theatrical seamlessness. And Two, Julian's death scene...that REALLY fake ""green screen"" street rushing by in the background when Cathy and Julian are arguing in the car was SOOO bad I almost giggled and it made the whole scene teeter on the edge of high camp. Seriously guys, don't do that again.

The rest of the production is so good, that I was able to look past those two pet peeves. Holding my hopes high for If There Be Thorns. So ready!",1411516800,,2968,4.787109375

I understand that producers try to make the best version into a movie by crowding as much of the book's important details so that the viewer can understand the concept.

The acting was good. Not really great but fairly reasonable. The most talented actor was hardly shown which would be Ellen Burstyn . These were young actors on their way up and they were good. Can't take away from them their talent.
Some of the parts were almost comical because as I said , they were crammed to close together and caused a little humor in that regard. But , take my word for it,. The book is better. More exciting and you cannot sense the confusion the kids had after getting away from their Grandmothers attic. In the movie they just show that their incestuous desires just  suddenly happened.

There are a few graphic sex scenes, so this isn't a movie to watch with the family. They recast ed the siblings in this one since they had aged 10 years and because of the more mature content.

Even though it's been quite a few years since I read the Flowers in the Attic series, I'm still pretty sure that more than half of what happened in this film did not occur in the books. This was beyond cheesy and badly acted(Heather Graham anyone?). I had zero expectations going into this and after the not much better Flowers in the Attic, I didn't think it could get worse. I watched this because of boredom and a stupid sense of obligation. There hasn't been an adaptation of Petals on the Wind before so I gave it a chance.

I wouldn't even call this a guilty pleasure. It's just plain bad. Ellen Burstyne is the only slightly redeemable part of this but her role is minuscule and not worth it in the end. Just stick to re-reading the books and not sullying those memories...",1403481600,5,870,4.4375
6424733,3,B00KFNF17E,"I had higher hopes for this movie, but I don't think it's as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. This is HARD book to make into a movie, same as Flowers. I didn't like it per say, but there are many movies far worse that fans adore (I'm not talking about Twilight before anyone thinks that). I have loved the books since I was in middle school (I'm 18 now). Personally I think they should have made it a series like HBO did for Game of Thrones.",1403395200,7,449,4.056179775280899
6424734,5,B00KFNF17E,If you're like me and are in love with the books and have read them you will notice there are alot of differences between the book and the movie. But besides that it was great and I think all the actors were pretty good. Also if christopher is as sexy as the guy who played christopher in this movie i don't know if i will be able to contain myself.,1403136000,,349,4.0

6424737,5,B00KFNF17E,"if you saw flowers in the attic you have to continue the story here. just like the books the storyline is a bit over dramatic but if you liked the 1st one you'll be glad to see the followup. and if you know the books, you know to expect the melodrama anyway.",1402876800,,258,3.980769230769231

6424739,4,B00KFNF17E,"This is the 2nd in a series of movies based upon the V.C. Andrews books about the Doppleganger family.  Petals on the Wind was actually a bit better than Flowers in the Attic (first in the series) but it was really difficult for the movie makers to cram this entire book into a 2 hour movie - the story in the movie seems to fly by somewhat but it covers the important parts.  The trailer of this movie gave away TOO much information - it was very long and covered about every dramatic detail of the movie so that kind of spoiled the movie just a bit.  Another thing...if you haven't read the book, be aware that this story involves an incestual relationship between the two main characters.  It couldn't be left out as this relationship is a huge part of the entire series of books.  If you have younger folks watching this, I'd suggest a discussion before and afterwards just to make sure they understand what is happening.  The Lifetime network has released a teaser promising movies following this one based on the next two books in the series -If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday.  I'm looking forward to watching those two as well!",1402790400,13,1143,4.492753623188406
6424740,4,B00KFNF17E,"I watched Flowers in the Attic on television, but couldn't Petals on the Wind. I'm kinda glad that I bought it. It's not bad. Heather Graham goes a little overboard on the scene chewing, but let's be honest it's Kathy's story. The actors that portrayed the three remaining kids were great.",1402704000,4,289,4.686274509803922
6424741,2,B00KFNF17E,I just finished watching Petals on the Wind. I was struck by the universally bad acting and terrible production values. The film looked low budget even by Lifetime standards. Yet it was hard to look away. I remember reading the book many years ago and I was surprised that Lifetime did not shy away from the incest story line.,1402531200,,326,4.5423728813559325

6424743,4,B00KFNF17E,"This film was great.  I didn't like the actress who was cast as ""Cathy"",  but all-in-all,  this was a great movie.  Ellen Burstyn is perfect.  This isn't a film for the children,  although.  There are some rather gratuitously sexual scenes.  The whole ""incest"" thing is enough to gag a maggot,  however,  it truly makes you feel anger for these characters.  The only real ""good guy"" in this film,  is the Grandmother.  She's the only one you don't really feel disgust for.",1402444800,,472,4.679012345679013

6424748,4,B00KFNF17E,"This is the Lifetime sequel to ""Flowers in the Attic"" which left me speechless. The film picks up a few years later. Our children managed to survive until Dr. Paul Sheffield adopted them. The incestuous siblings pick up where they left off. Cathy (Rose McIver) leaves for NY for ballet. Christopher (Wyatt Nash) is following his adopted father in the medical field and young Carrie (Bailey Buntain) has trouble adapting socially to high school and the world in general.

Christopher gets a girlfriend and plans to get married, while Cathy is pregnant with a child she claims is her ballet boy friend, but who knows. Mom (Heather Graham) makes it back into the film during the second half.

I was scratching my head at the disjointed script and soap opera type drama. Wyatt Nash reminded me of Casper Van Dien and not in a good way. The plot twisted in ways I was not prepared for, i.e. the character has not really been established, especially Cathy who ranged from sweet innocent to demonic devious. The sexual curiosity of Carrie was done awkwardly if not unintentionally comical.  The bizarreness of the film, kept me watching, like a train wreak. Please don't make another one because I will watch it. I haven't read the book, but it has to be better.

Rated TV-14 for theme and implied sex. Several scenes of clothes being removed and passionate kissing.  Rose McIver in bra.",1402185600,5,1380,4.7573221757322175

6424750,1,B00KFNF17E,"What in the HELL was this? I don't blame the actors- they didn't write this but Cathy was a steel hearted, strong, cynical powerhouse in the books- this character was like a battered housewife. Horrible!!! That is NOT who Cathy was. So rushed. So impossible to wrap this book into a 90 minute movie. So sad- because it would have been a great mini series because the books have such a following.",1401580800,11,395,4.5
6424751,5,B00KFNF17E,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie, I loved it! I have watched it four times in 6 days. The only thing I wished had changed about this movie id I wish it was longer or they had divided it up into two movies. I am excited to see If there be thorns and seedsof yesterday, I hope to see Rose McIver and Wyatt Nash together again on screen, they did an amazing job. They couldn't have cast a better Cathy and Christopher, the chemistry between them was amazing. I do wish they had shown more of Cathy and Christopher together, it is such a sick and twisted romantic love story, this movie is a must see!!!!",1401580800,13,599,4.217391304347826

The children are grown up and living a life outside the attic as normal as can be until their adopted parent dies. Problems in the children's/young adults lives start to arise that bring them back to their mother. What do they seek from their mother? Revenge or answers? I won't tell you, but it's worth finding out.

I couldn't stop watching this movie which is what lead me to give it a rating of 5 stars.
I liked how dramatic it is, but I don't like the sibling scenes.
I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 16 who likes twisted stories or movies with a gorgeous cast. Almost too gorgeous...",1401235200,3,691,4.315384615384615

8658202,1,B00KFNF17E,Nothing like taking a great series and trashing it.  This is probably the most offensive rendition of the 4 done...They are so many characters that could have been explored better.  Sorry Heather Graham's portrayal of Corrine was sad.  At least the first Flowers in the Attic in 1987 had a wicked mother that was believable.  Only positive was Ellen Burstyn.  No clue how this is rated 4 stars? Maybe if you didn't read the books this would be enjoyable?,1529366400,,454,4.69620253164557

8658204,4,B00KFNF17E,"TV movie sequel based on the follow up to Flowers In the Attic. Petals is definitely an improvement on the first installment. The producers finally realized the over the top soap factor and just went for it. The sequel has more sex, scandal, and lust just like in the book. Fans of the original novel will see that chunks of the beginning of the story were removed, and I would say that it didn't really effect the movie overall. Petals on the Wind probably would have worked better in two parts as opposed to one. Things feel a little rushed and it shows. The cast is good, especially Rose McIver as an older Cathy. Heather Graham seems more comfortable in this movie than she did in Flowers, and her performance fells less wooden as she embraces the vapid soullessness of Corrinne. This movie series has a car wreck quality to it. It's not brilliant TV but you can't help but keep watching.",1507507200,,892,4.512345679012346
