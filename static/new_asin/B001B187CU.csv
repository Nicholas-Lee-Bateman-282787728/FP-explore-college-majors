3479276,5,B001B187CU,"The most amazing movie about fighter pilots training to fly f-14s.  Unbelievable cinematography, its like watching the real Top Gun. This movie's been making its rounds at film festivals. I saw it at the Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose.  I can't wait for its official release in September.",1217203200,3,293,4.959183673469388
3479277,5,B001B187CU,"First of, I have no idea why amazon says its gonna be released in Sept 08.  Bought this DVD from another site in Aug07.  However it was more expensive and had some delivery issues.

The whole movie was very real in terms of the later stages of pilot training and how it feels to enter a mission ready squadron being the newbie, or the ""nugget"".  Personally enjoyed the story of ""faceshot"" the most.  Really inspiriing story of perserverence and crazy amounts of will. Great cinematography and accompanying soundtracks and it also has some actual footage of him in combat.  Scenes from BFM really feels like you're in the cockpit pullin the same Gs.  If you enjoyed top gun cuz you thought the planes were cool, then you'll definately enjoy this, being possibly the last production featuring the Tomcat.",1216252800,3,802,4.768115942028985

3479280,5,B001B187CU,"A Righteous video about the Tomcat.  An intimate over-the-shoulder documentary of two Naval Aviators who share their dreams, frustrations and pride.  A hoo-yah video rush on carrier decks, in jet fighter cockpits, around ready rooms.  Fallon dogfights, ground attacks, night traps.  They're all here.  Some people complained about the video quality.  I never noticed anything around me after the jets started catapulting off the carrier.  Duh.",1472342400,,443,5.621212121212121

By following 2 individuals I could see that everyone over comes challenges with different styles and outcomes.  The photography is amazing and the ship board flight video was shockingly true to life. It also helped show that ones sex has little to do with the ability to get the job done.  Great flick.  Art",1432425600,,467,4.728395061728395

Also can show the very real risks and dangers, including tragic crashes and the dangers of SAM (surface to air missiles) that our pilots must deal with.  Reminder that this show is the real deal with humans under extreme stress and danger, so be prepared for a few scenes of rough language.

3479302,5,B001B187CU,"I had the pleasure of attending the Naval Academy during the time Meagan and Jay went (I was originally class of '02 and graduated with '03). This film about their flying careers was not only interesting but truly eye-opening to the many challenges that fighter pilots must overcome to be successful. One will have a whole new respect to what our Naval aviators go through when trying to land on a carrier in pitch black darkness.

3479306,5,B001B187CU,"I will admit that I am an aviation nut. Never the less, I have no hesitation in giving this DVD five stars. It is not a highly technical aviation DVD but rather concentrates on the human element and what it takes to be a Naval Aviator. The footage is pretty cool too. If you are remotely into aviation I would recommend this DVD.",1321228800,2,329,4.238095238095238
3479307,5,B001B187CU,"The movie is about the experience of 2 pilots going through F-14 rigorous trainings.  It not only shows the glamorous side of pilots, but realistically reflects the emotional turmoils they go thru in the process before triumph.  It's very motivating, and I've not seen other fighter pilot documentary as such.  It makes u feel connected with the characters.  I wish the movie was longer though.",1311724800,2,394,5.015384615384615

3479310,5,B001B187CU,"I enjoyed the dvd because she was the only F-14 female pilot then, before the plane was retired in 2006.  It was a different perspective of just watching male pilots all the time.  Very good dvd for anyone interested in The F-14 Tomcat.  Excellent dvd.",1293753600,,252,4.555555555555555
3479311,4,B001B187CU,An exciting documentary. Unfortunately the images does not met the standard of bluray format - clear & bright. The camera used does not appear to be of HD. Anyway an excellent piece to watch.,1292803200,2,191,4.647058823529412
3479312,5,B001B187CU,As a former Navy pilot I went into a cold sweat when viewing the section of this video that showed the two trainees in night carrier quals.  It was extremely well done and put you right back in the cockpit. Also the pilots first experience in combat in Iraq was more informative than any other piece I have seen that shows modern aerial warfare. I could watch this video 100 times!,1291248000,,381,4.366197183098592
3479313,5,B001B187CU,"Those of you who loved the movie Top Gun with Tom Cruise, will love this.  Ok, there are no Tom Cruise or Kelly McGillis characters and it's not scripted etc, but the arial combat sequences are second to none.  The arial photography is almost identical to that of Top Gun however it is captured as it happened with full audio of the pilots and the briefing and debriefing of the sorties.

This movie charts the story of two young Navy recruits who are to become some of the last people to be trained to fly the F-14 Tomcat and they only have one shot at it before being sent aboard the carrier and into war over Iraq/Afghanistan.  What is surprising with this film is that it draws you into the lives of the families, instructors and friends of the two students who give their perspectives of how hard it is to deal with war and the purpose of working in such dangerous environments.

Many of the fellow pilots in the students squadrons feature in the movie , together with some icons of the Tomcat community such as Dale ""Snort"" Snodegrass instructor and Jim ""Puck"" Howe of VF-31 Tomcatters.

I highly recommend this movie on a number of levels.  It has the heart wrenching story that can (depending on how emotionally weak you are!!) draw you to tears but also gives the same visual energy and kick that Top Gun gave in the mid eighties and even now.

You gotta buy it!!",1282262400,,1372,4.438247011952191
3479314,5,B001B187CU,This is a great documentary.  I got the Blu-ray and its great.  They follow these two naval aviators thru their F-14 training on the last Tomcat class of the VF-101 Grim Reapers.  You get some background on each of their challenges of getting to be pilots and thru the F-14 class and follow them into the fleet.  This is a must for any F-14 fan or aviation buff.,1274832000,,362,4.279411764705882
3479315,4,B001B187CU,This documentory was awesome. For someone who grew up loving fighter planes I found this video to be great. It featured amazing dog fight sequences and real heart hitting stories about the piolots.,1266537600,2,197,5.0
3479316,4,B001B187CU,"This documentary can't be praised too much.  Great story, interesting characters, superb photography all centered around ""nuggets"" learning to fly the late, great, and much missed F-14.  Given the struggle the producers and to get this to the public, thank goodness they persevered.  Highly, highly recommended.

There is a fly in the ointment:  Although the price difference between the DVD and the Blu Ray version has narrowed, the DVD is the better buy.  The Blu Ray version's quality is only marginally superior to the DVD, especially on an upscaling player, possibly because the producers had to expend so much to get it distributed at all that they didn't enough funds left to do a proper HiDef version.  Get the DVD.  You'll save a couple of bucks, still have this magnificent production, and you'll be able to show it on any DVD or Blu Ray player.

So I grade the documentary a 5 +, but the disappointing quality of the Blu Ray lowers my overall grade to a 4.",1257379200,3,967,4.708333333333333

3479321,5,B001B187CU,"The title ""Speed and Angels"" is a key component in the exhilarating action of this movie and is an analogy to the lifequest of two inspired aviators.  This film, several years in the making, is a passionate construct by director Peyton Wilson; initiated as a documentary, the driving force which focused all components is the evolving human interest story and how dreams are achieved.

3479325,5,B001B187CU,"I was pleased to view his documentary film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. I was also able to meet the two pilots, the Producer, Director and Editor of the film. As a retired Lt. Colonel and an aviator, I found the storyline quite excellent. A true story and something we rarely have an opportunity to see in this day and age of our military. The storyline of the two young pilots was well done, the cinematography superb, and the information about the requirements of attaining and being selected for the flight status in the F-14 was very interesting. Although the F-14 is no longer in the inventory and has been replaced by a more modern aircraft, the story is no less interesting. I encourage you all to see this film. Well done.",1233446400,,737,4.548872180451128

3479331,5,B001B187CU,"I just watched this movie for free on [...].  I've been an aviation junkie ever since my friend's dad took me up for a flight when I was 13.  Since then I've become obsessed with flight.  Top Gun was a great movie, but I knew it was just a movie.  Speed and Angels is the real deal, and that fact makes it (in my opinion) better than Top Gun.  There's lots of footage from the cockpit, and lots of radio chatter.  You do get a sense of what the pilots are experiencing, and the way the film was edited gives you a glimpse at how quickly information comes at you.

An excellent documentary.  I'm going to buy it for the special features (one disadvantage of watching it on Hulu).",1229731200,,678,4.2015503875969

This movie will motivate anyone who thinks they don't have a shot of achieving their goals.  These two individuals had to overcome so much in order to achieve their life long goals of being Naval Aviators.

3479334,4,B001B187CU,"This is a very well done movie based on two fresh Naval Aviators. It follows them through their struggles and life of becoming a figher pilot. The movie accurately depicts pilots training and job with the US Navy. If you are ever interested in becoming a pilot or want to get a good look at what they go through, this a great movie for you. I give it 4 out of 5 stars due to it being more of a documentary rather than more of an action film.",1227484800,,441,4.0227272727272725
3479335,5,B001B187CU,"I originally purchased this documentary with the hope that I would get some good High Def footage of the F-14 Tomcat. The footage turned out to be great and the quality of the image on screen during aerial scenes was exactly what I was looking for. The aerial scenes were cut action movie style but was very well done and made the film a little more exciting and more fun to follow for the average person.

What suprised me was that this was an all around quality production. The story of both of the pilots that the film makers followed was extremely engaging. It was actually inspiring to hear their story, and see the tremendous odds they overcame to achieve their dreams. Like no kidding adversities that the average person would use to get out of mowing the lawn or use to not get out of bed in the morning.

The film follows both of them from when they were student F-14 pilots, to when they make it to the fleet, to the first time they get deployed, to when one of them faces actual combat, to them sharing their thoughts after they have achieved their dream. This is an all around good documentary that I can see a lot of people get emotionally invested into when watching it.",1226534400,2,1184,4.401826484018265

And more importantly, an excellent video diary of the passionate human spirit.  Defeat is not an option.  Meagans ordeal with her inner self on the carrier is a testament to the power of determination and ""Faceshot"" says all one needs to know about Jay.",1224979200,,420,4.684931506849315

3479338,3,B001B187CU,"More or less as expected for a naval pilot documentary.  A little slower paced than I would have liked, covering the 2 pilots' lives more than the actual flying. Some great video footage, and especially nice was the fact that the aircraft flown is the F-14, an aircraft now retired that we will see less and less of.",1224547200,,316,4.448275862068965
3479339,5,B001B187CU,"Superior footage of the flying and fighting compared to many movies that are singularly focused on that aspect.

However, the movie is so much more than just action scenes. Never a word but those of the pilots/trainees yet with a very few subtitles you are in the lives of the pilots. It sucks you in and leaves you holding your breath through most of the movie!

If you buy it only for the dogfight/aerial footage, you won't be even slightly disappointed.

If you buy it for a good movie to inspire you and could care less about the aerial footage, you still won't be disappointed.

It really is that well done!!! Bravo to all of you on the crew!!!",1223596800,,649,4.428571428571429

This movie really takes the in-flight portions to the next level even better than Top Gun did in my opinion. Where is Speed and Angels 2 already? What happens to Jay and Meagan? It's funny but this story had me captivated enough to actually remember the characters names long after seeing it.

A must see for aviation buffs...",1222646400,4,459,4.597560975609756
3479341,5,B001B187CU,"Loved this documentary.  The story is told through the compelling personal stories of two young, aspiring pilots - one man and one woman.  Their back stories, families, and personal histories provide a rich context for the stunning footage of planes landing on aircraft carriers, aerial dogfights and military settings. The passion these pilots have for what they do transcends the specifics of flying and has universal appeal.  As a middle-aged liberal female I was surprised to enjoy the film as much as I did. Especially loved how the woman pilot's challenges were portrayed.  A true glimpse into a world I knew nothing about but now admire.",1221609600,,644,5.047169811320755
3479342,5,B001B187CU,"I really liked that this documentary is both a left and right brain kind of movie.  For the left brain folks, Speed & Angels is a serious & compelling look at what it takes to become a navy fighter pilot.  It describes the roles of F-14 Fighter pilots and their RIOs (ie copilots), the training involved, the physical and mental challenges they go thru, and the constant danger that they face.  For the right brain, the story unfolds as we meet two remarkable aspiring pilots with incredible will and determination.  We meet them, their friends, families, and co-workers, and learn their stories.  We witness the challenges our heroes face as they complete their flight training, and make the leap from training environment to learning the challenges of dogfighting and daytime/nighttime carrier landings.

Speed & Angels is a visually stunning, inspiring documentary that educated me as to what it means to achieve a goal and inspired me to pursue my own.",1221609600,,956,4.94375

3479344,5,B001B187CU,"I am a peacenik so I went into the theater preview of Speed and Angels sceptical and ready to be contentious.  Yet the film's brilliant and sympathetic crafting overpowered me. I spent the whole movie perched  on the edge of my seat.  Here is a story of the desire to be the best at something very hard and to risk all to gain all.  Yes, it is about fighter pilots.  But no it is not a war movie. It is an intricate tale of what it took for one man and one woman to be the best at what they do.  I was captivated by it.  Technically, it will knock your socks off.  Visually it is stunning beyond belief.  Emotionally, it is the work of masters.",1221523200,,644,4.0476190476190474
3479345,5,B001B187CU,"I have always wondered what it's like to be a fighter pilot, since only being up there doing the job can really answer that question; words just fail to describe it.  Well, this movie has answered that question and more.  While watching it, we participate in breathtaking dog-fighting scenes, nerve-wracking aircraft carrier landings, classroom instruction, but best of all, we see it all through the eyes of Jay and Meagan, two of the last F-14 pilots for the US Navy.  We cheer for their joys and achievements, we worry with them through their difficult training, and we are proud of their accomplishments in spite of impossible odds.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, better than Top Gun, because you know that the stakes are real this time.  After you watch it, you'll want to see it over and over again!",1221264000,,824,4.655172413793103

The two individual F-14 ""Tom Cat"" pilots (one female, one male) that are featured in this documentary have inspirational individual stories. Out of the 3,000+ fighter pilots presently in the US military, there are only 24 women. There is only one female F-14 ""Tom Cat"" fighter pilot in the military at this time, she is one out of 100,000 (mostly men) dreaming to be an F-14 pilot. The man F-14 fighter pilot is a study in overcoming adversity. Following these two young pilots from training in dog fighting over the Nevada desert to night time carrier landings, realizing their dreams to be an F-14 ""Tom Cat"" pilot and then beyond their dreams to the reality of combat missions over Iraq makes this documentary very powerful. The footage is remarkable, from the actual footage of these two young pilots first time night landings, to air war over Iraq along with the dog fights over the Nevada desert, makes this exciting, unusual, worth watching more than once.",1221004800,2,1114,4.930851063829787

A moving docudrama, about an ordinary young man and woman who take on the responsibility of becoming part of America's military resource in the service of our nation, without  all the gung ho stuff normally resereved for this kind of porpoganda. Instead of a flag waving endorsement of war, it's a sensitive and personal story of two humble kids and their love for flying. We follow them as they challenge themselves to become what they have always wanted. It's a struggle not without personal sacrifice and challenging internal obstacles of character and diligance. A wonderfully uplifting character study of people of great character-not your typical recruiting film for the Navy. Instead we are treated to regular people reaching for their dreams. No matter what your political persuasion, this film effectively gets you rooting for these young pilots, as they go through death defying training and eventual combat as they soar
into the blue. A first class piece of work!",1221004800,2,1094,5.140449438202247

That could probably be said about a lot of well-produced documentaries that come and go.  But this is a film that I saw once, over a year ago, and to this day I can recall scene after scene, I'm still thinking about it, and I 'm still spreading the word with friends.  Hard to put a finger on it, but there are 2 segments that have to be seen to be believed: a) dogfighting training at Pilot School, and b) landing on an aircraft carrier at night.

3479355,5,B001B187CU,Great independent film that I saw at Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose last year. The aerial photogrphy rivals that of Top Gun. The story of Meagan and Jay provide real insight on just what it takes to make it as a fighter pilot. The task of landing a figher onto the deck of an aircraft carrier moving up and down in the middle of the night gives us a brief look at the kind of stress these pilots go through.

3479356,5,B001B187CU,"I saw the preview in a theater at the recommendation of one of my grad students who had flown the F-14.

The audience reaction was interesting in that both the men and women attending seemed to enjoy the film equally. A very rare case of a movie capturing the challenge of military flying.  Very good job of binding both the human story and great flying scenes into a documentary where the drama is not manufactured.

A great chic flick in that one of the two pilots followed is a young woman of exceptional talent.

The film follows two pilots through their transitioning training into the F-14 community. For those not familiar with the airplane the F-14 is big, fast and intolerant of neglect on the part of the pilot.

The air to air photography is stunning.

Highly recommended, I bought the cd for friends to share. Initial reactions from non pilots are very positive.",1220918400,3,874,4.642857142857143

Meagan and Jay are what we should be pushing our kids to be. Not the sloths they are becoming. Buy this movie and watch it with your child. Remind them of the proud, patriotic heritage that produces men and women willing to sacrifice for their country. My only problem with this new version is there is a game that didn't come with the first one. BUY IT!",1220918400,,506,4.28125

I have had junior high and high school students watch this movie to inspire them to have high goals for their life and to do everything they possibly can to achieve those goals.

This movie is also amazing in the way it is filmed.  The in flight shots were done very nicely.  The filters used in those scenes make them look beautiful.  I've been waiting for this movie to be released on Blu-ray so that I can see this amazing movie in high definition.

You really grasp how difficult and dramatic the lifestyle of a Navy fighter pilot is.  The director does a great job of connecting personal stories with the plot.  To meet the main character and to hear what he had to say about flight training and actual combat in Iraq made it more than another flim.  It was a link for civilians to experience the day-in-the-life of a fighter pilot.  The action footage was awesome and it doesn't get much better than this!

The main characters, Jay and Meagan are captivating and you want to watch them all the way to the end. The military education you get and the flying footage is invaluable and not out in any other media for people to access.

We also met Peyton (director) and Megan (pilot) after the show and where impressed by both.

We will have more as I have ordered both the standard dvd and the Blue Ray versions, even though I don't have a Blue Ray yet. But we will. Excited to see in in both formats.

The film follows the trials and tribulations of two very different young people in one of the most emotionally and physically demanding careers in the military. With cameras rolling, we follow Jay and Meagan through US Naval Aviator training and into the controversial Iraq war. Throughout their struggles Jay and Meagan show us their personal sides; from interaction with family to off the cuff interviews, this film has a strong human element. But the human element is only one part. The film also showcases the last combat deployment of the US Navy's venerable F-14 Tomcat, a legend in its own right.

The film engulfs the viewer in the lives of 2 aviators going from ground school to real navy action in the middle east. Also, this documentary chronicles the unique experience of piloting an F-14 in combat by some of the last pilots in the world to claim that honor.

I thought I'd watch for 15 minutes and politely say, ""Gee, thanks, that was swell!"" But I was immediately drawn in, happily stayed with it and am glad I did. I think everyone who watches this will be intrigued and most will fall in love with it. Okay, and the flight scenes were really exciting!",1219708800,,595,4.182608695652174
3479393,5,B001B187CU,"With apologies to Lance Armstrong, ""It's not about the planes,"" although the footage of these fighter pilots in action is thrilling to watch.  No, it's about the two young pilots whose progress through Top Gun school this film follows, and their older comrades and mentors.  Put aside all thoughts of a cheeseball flick like ""Top Gun.""  You couldn't ask for two more engaging, interesting young people to feature in a movie of any kind, let alone a documentary about a slice of military life.  This movie is not pro- or anti- anything, expect for being pro- talented, dedicated people.  I have no particular fascination with war or the military, but I've seen ""Speed & Angels"" three times now.  One of the three best documentaries I've ever seen.  Five stars.",1219622400,,759,4.837209302325581
3479394,5,B001B187CU,"I saw this film in the theater last year and found it a fascinating look inside the world of ariel dogfighting. The cinematography and the flying scenes were fantastically shot and exhillerating to watch. But what made the film resonate with me (to the point where is still sticks in my head a year later) were the incredibly personal stories of the pilots in training.

It's also very timely, with our nation at war -- and I appreciated it being slanted neither jingoistic or politically anti-war. Make no mistake, this is a film about a dying art form and the people who (quite literally) are willing to die for it.

If you have an interest in flying, the military, or even just an exceptionally well made documentary, Speed & Angels is well worth a look.

I would imagine on blu-ray, it would be the ideal way to screen it, short of an IMAX!",1219276800,5,844,4.503267973856209
3479395,5,B001B187CU,"Speed & Angels is not only a rare behind-the-scenes tour of US Navy aircraft carriers, training facilities, and flight crew operations, but a personal and emotional exploration of the lives of two young pilots.

I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1219276800,,236,5.2105263157894735
3479396,5,B001B187CU,"I had the chance to see this film a few weeks ago, and it is by far the best documentary on Navy pilots ever put out there. Peyton Wilson is a very talented director who not only shoots fantastic arial scenes, but also achieves a closeness with her characters that is nothing short of amazing. A must see.",1219190400,16,305,4.275862068965517
3479397,5,B001B187CU,"Speed and Angels is an amazing human interest story about the dedication and perseverance required to achieve your dreams.  While the aerial and cockpit scenes are breathtaking, the real power behind this film is in the stories of Jay and Meagan and their unwillingness to settle for anything less than fulfilling their lifelong ambitions.  You truly get to know these young pilots and will find yourself rooting for them to succeed.  A really great documentary delivered with a personal, unbiased and honest touch.",1219190400,14,515,5.180722891566265
3479398,5,B001B187CU,I saw a very early screening of this film over a year ago in San Francisco. The true-life story of these young fighter pilots is even more amazing and exciting because it unfolds in front of your eyes. This movie also has the best aerial footage of a dogfight that I have ever seen. At the screening the director said that the audio was mixed at George Lucas' Skywalker Sound...and it shows. The dogfight scenes sound incredible. I am sure that this will be my favorite Blu-ray DVD for a long time to come.,1219190400,7,506,4.3936170212765955
3479399,5,B001B187CU,"This film is perfect for everyone! It has heart, action, inspiration, and adrenaline. It grabs you in the first 3 minutes and never lets you go. The aerial footage is amazing, and the access to the Navy is unprecedented. This is a must buy for flight enthusiasts, actions junkies and video gamers alike. More real then TOP GUN!!",1219104000,,328,4.672413793103448
3479400,5,B001B187CU,"Speed and Angels is fabulous.  Not only did the film make me feel as though I was in the cockpit with these two young fighter pilots, I felt such a strong connection with their personal journeys.  Jay and Megan, the two main characters are so determined, so vulnerable and so full of personality, I was dying for them to succeed!  This is a great family film.",1219104000,,359,4.409090909090909

3479404,5,B001B187CU,"This is an awesome film that is also inspiring. It is a moving story about people you come to care about while you are dazzled with ariels, one of the worlds most difficult and dangerous jobs ever, and how two particularly unlikely young pilots overcome huge individual obstacles to achieve a personal best like few others.

You soar with them in ways that are as thrilling as a mach one joy ride, as intense as landing on a carrier at night , and as fulfilling as if you'd accomplished these feats yourself.

Speed & Angels is so much more than you'd imagine, and everything you want, all at the same time!",1219104000,,607,4.45945945945946

3479407,5,B001B187CU,"Saw Speed & Angels at the National Air & Space Museum's IMAX theatre in 2007. This was by far the most amazing documentary on the fighter jet pilot's pinnacle of career training and about the last of an amazing breed of jet, the F-14 Tomcat. If you haven't any idea about a fighter pilot's world, or if you are one yourself, the two stories and the cinematography alone would be worth your time. But together it really is something else to experience and really feel what it must be like to be one of the worlds most elite and talented people with wings.",1217376000,4,554,4.388349514563107

My hat is off to Jay and Meagan for exposing their inner soles to the public. My life experience has indicated that only a small percentage of the population is capable of putting all of these factors together to achieve their dreams.  They serve as a great example to the rest of us.  To all the fighter pilots of the world...you honor us!",1520553600,,514,4.604395604395604

Forget ""The Blue Max"", ""TopGun"", ""Flight of the Intruder"", the oldie ""Battle of Britain"",etc. I felt all the emotion and thrill and pressure those guys were going through as each phase of training was conducted and then the actual fleet deployment.

Filmmakers follow two Student Pilots as they attempt to qualify as Aviators
Only possible negative I found was that it is dated, somewhat... F-14... But hey, it is a cool plane & I dig it :)
