4279470,1,B00475FLB2,"Again, I was looking for the hour long shows not the condensed half hour version of the show, so what was received is less than what I desired",1390348800,,142,4.107142857142857
4279471,5,B00475FLB2,"Love, love,love this series and the price was awesome. Can't wait to order more seasons. The only thing I was dissapointed with was the inability to play all episodes without having to press play each time.",1389052800,,206,4.75
4279472,2,B00475FLB2,"I love the snapped series. It's relaxing, slower paced show that doesn't require much brain power and they re-cap after each commercial spot so I don't have to worry about missing something. However, Season 1-3, I don't like the narrator. I think she just tries too hard and it's not natural.  Season 4-10 they have a new narrator = much better.",1383868800,,345,4.655737704918033
4279473,5,B00475FLB2,I love this program and it's always fun to watch when i want and without commercials.  I travel a lot so I can't really plan to watch my favorites - so DVDs make that possible.,1382054400,,176,4.0285714285714285
4279474,5,B00475FLB2,I loved the fact that I can get both the first and second season together. It's a nice combination because you get so many episodes for a good price.,1368489600,,149,4.172413793103448
4279475,5,B00475FLB2,Great show!!! Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys watching case files or virtually anything that has to do with crime scenes or forensics....shows of that nature.,1367884800,,174,5.481481481481482
4279476,4,B00475FLB2,"The stories were interesting and the boxed set is a good value. Several of the stories have been shown in a different format on other series, however this series has many interviews with the real life people involved, which is not as common.",1366761600,,241,4.627906976744186
4279477,5,B00475FLB2,"I really enjoy this series. Like other reviews, I wish there was a ""play all"" selection.  Other than that, it is better than the TV show as it has no commercials.",1364688000,,162,4.225806451612903
4279478,5,B00475FLB2,"Good show - Well presented, very informative.  A unique insight into understanding criminals.  A good addition to my ""True Crime"" collection.",1364688000,4,141,5.666666666666667
4279479,5,B00475FLB2,Glad I got started watching this series. Once you will get started watching them you're hooked  I would recommend to anyone.,1363564800,,124,4.904761904761905
4279497,5,B00475FLB2,I really enjoy watching this series however I was a little disappointed to see the episodes were the short version as opposed to the hour long DETAILED version on Oxygen channel.  I still give it five stars because it's a GREAT show!!!!!!!,1360713600,,239,4.690476190476191
4279498,5,B00475FLB2,I use to watch this show when I use to have cable. This set shows you the lengths some will go to to get what they want.,1356739200,,120,3.4814814814814814
4279499,5,B00475FLB2,"I LOVE THIS SHOW>  The only thing that kinda stinks is that you can't just hit ""play all"" you have to hit play for every episode.",1355443200,,129,3.9615384615384617
4279500,4,B00475FLB2,"happy with this purchase,dvds were in good condition,the episodes included were entertaining, i cant complain,would purchase more seasons but i probably will watch it only once and forget about it as i did with this one.",1354752000,,220,5.138888888888889
4279501,4,B00475FLB2,"This is one of the better type documentary style shows that I enjoy...although it did take a bit for me to get used too.  If you like Forensic Files, FBI Files, Twisted,then this also would fit in your area of interst.  (It was more of the style of the show that had taken me a bit to get used too)  Although I do tend to enjoy True Crime that involves sociopaths and the truly disturbed or serial killers, I still enjoy some of the shows from time to time.  (also a huge True Crime reader)

The only frustrating this is that this dvd does not have Play All.  I don't know about anyone else but these shows are a shorter segment of the hour long shows...so it gets kintod of irritating to hit play after each episode.  (sometimes I like to have the DVD's playing as I clean house, do my work in University, well you get the picture. yet even without the DVD sometimes it seems like 30 minutes is much to short for a deeper understanding of the person unlike the many other one hour True Crime documentary.  Forensic Files, which is also 30 minutes for me completes the task of the who when why where and what, but that show focuses more on the technology og solving crimes.  When shows concentrate on the killer an hour is sufficient because it allows for more of a rounded understanding of the individual to include background, Lifestyle, etc

Still a great show, and I would have added five starts but took one away for the missing Play All.",1334793600,7,1443,4.350746268656716

4279503,4,B00475FLB2,"I enjoy this series.  I agree with another reviewer that Deadly Women uses too many re-enactments and not enough documentary footage, although I enjoy the series' irreverent approach to true crime.  By contrast, this show has documentary footage, interviews with many of the principals and investigators in the case profiled in each episode, including occasionally the convicted killer.  I think the early seasons might be better than the more recent ones because they were only a half-hour long in the earlier years.  I don't think these episodes need to be dragged out for an hour.

My main complaint is the producers have no hesitation of putting the crime scene photographs of victims, sometimes showing them repeatedly and close up.  What is the point of this, other than sensationalism?  There are friends and family members of these murder victims who actually might be watching the show, and I feel the producers are a bit too insensitive to their feelings.  One of the most disturbing episodes in this set was the one about ""Elisa McNabney,"" aka Laren Renee Sims Jordan.  I happened to have known her victim, husband Larry McNabney, although not well.  He was an attorney who had an office in Las Vegas when he met Elisa/Laren, but he was based in Reno.  McNabney was a regular patron at the law library located upstairs in the courthouse in Reno where I had worked part-time back in the 1990s-early 2000s.  He would frequently come in on the weekends. He would exchange banter with me and always get a cup of coffee. Very pleasant guy, always wore a cowboy hat.  At least once, Elisa/Laren came in with him.  It may have been after they were married.  They had checked out some books.  I was so horrified when I had heard McNabney was murdered in Sacramento some years later and especially in the heinous way it was done.  That was unnerving enough, but then we have this show that has no compunction of showing the man's body after he was dug up from a shallow grave Elisa/Laren and her co-conspirator Sarah Dutra had buried him.  This was a real person, not a mere body, a real person who had a family and many friends who loved him.  I could have gone the rest of my life and never have seen that picture.  One could say the same thing about the other episodes where these pictures are shown for pure shock value.  Despicable.

This is the reason I docked one star off of this review.  I don't think showing the crime scene photos is necessary; other true crime shows don't do it and don't need to do it.  Snapped's producers shouldn't do it, either.",1328832000,7,2563,4.657015590200445
4279504,5,B00475FLB2,"This is the best documentary I've seen, each episode is well presented and backed with actual pictures and video of both the criminal and the victim, unlike ID's ""Deadly Women"" which uses a lot of dramatization and reconstruction of the events.
There are 10 seasons so far, which proves how successful this show is, well done Oxygen Channel, just keep them coming and fast, not one season yearly :)",1328227200,5,398,4.782608695652174

I had heard how interesting the show was, and can confirm that it is very engaging.  I've watched these episodes several times.  The show has a good mixture of cases and moves along at a nice pace.

They lived in beautiful large homes, and were caught up in the social scene, meeting all kinds of people, dining in exclusive restaurants, visiting colourful night spots, wearing designer clothes, buying everything that their hearts desired. They were the envy of many. Yet still not compleatly satisfied with their lot, they wanted more. They wanted everything that their husbands had, they wanted it ALL....It became an obsession, a scheme begins to unfold, deciding to do away with their husbands PERMANENTLY.....All these episodes of SNAPPED, will hold your interest...Im sure you will find yourself watching them again, and AGAIN.",1524960000,,785,5.28
