7899483,4,6305995834,"The Tin Can 2 DVD offer from Timeless Media Group is a useful even intelligent introduction to our involvement in Southeast Asia. The two DVDs contain 4 sections per DVD divided by about 60 minutes per section. Disc 1 for instance has 1. Vietnam at War,2. Infantry & Armor and 3. The Viet Cong. 4. Khe Sanh. The 2nd Disc contains 1. The Helicopter War 2. The Air War 3. The Naval War. These respective sections show with both story and narrative the involvement which describe the respective section.""A true story of personal heroism and sacrifice.""Indeed there is much to listen to as distinquished Men talk of there deeds with accounts that will keep your attention. The  Helicopter has been often mentioned as being introduced in Southeast Asia with added depth placed in context as its namesake evolved from merely an air ambulance to possessing the ability as a full service air mobile vehicle. It was able to transform an entire campaign with its ability to meet an enemy with a mobil fierceness that our ability to succeeed would not of happened otherwise. Entire engagements occurred as a result of the air mobil ability to respond to a mounting threat. This is a very useful section with no shortage of personal heroism and the place as well as the value represented by the role that the Helicopter played in Southeast Asia. The Naval War section is very useful not so much as due to some standard thinking as per Aircraft Carriers and so on but on the Brown Water Navy as we get a look at the involvement of The Coast Guard. These were shallow draft boats who patrolled the mekong delta,with its many water ways and so on. This section was more involved with a real fire fight occurring when one of the coast guard boats signalled a small boat to stop. Though this was not the usual event as was explained most were honest people who had the right papers when these check points occurred. The prior mentioned boat found two persons run to shore fleeing the coast guard when shortly after they were to dissapear in the underbrush a fire fight broke out and a large explosion occurred. This was a true visual narrative with words and images being a real explanation as to the""Brown Water Navy"".The Viet Cong section sported a story that there was a prisoner exchange program whereby a number of American Prisoners of War told of being treated as the Viet Cong themselves were treated. It was suggested that the American Prisoners of War had respect for the Viet Cong with there particular confinement. The Viet Cong was a different soldier than the South Vietnam Soldier. This was not so much a surprise but an interesting observation that was expressed by a former POW.This particular 2 DVD Tin Can titled ""Vietnam Combat"" cost me $9.95. The information was useful,involved and ultimately an interesting look at our performance in Southeast Asia. It was not nearly thorough and even more so there was no where the depth that a more compelling requirement would of needed,however this was as said earlier a useful and interesting time spent. The regret is that the outcome in Southeast Asia was due to Politicians tying the hands on what our arm forces could do and could not do. It did more than merely cost us the war,it cost us our effort, it cost us our soldiers. It was pointed out that ""Desert Storm"" corrected the mistakes of Southeast Asia. This is indeed both history and a true commenting provided by Historians who served in Vietnam. It is useful and worth the time this will require to view all that this 2 DVD offer provides.",1370649600,3,3546,4.6826923076923075
7899484,1,6305995834,This was a boring and put you to sleep series of videos.  More like the training films we used to have to watch in boot camp.,1358121600,3,125,3.8076923076923075
7899485,5,6305995834,"I am very glad that I made this purchase. Although there have been many films about the war, this video goes farther in explaining in detail many of the circumstances surrounding the events of this era. The blu-ray adds defination to the photography.",1333497600,,250,4.837209302325581
7899486,4,6305995834,"I picked up this set ages ago and am fascinated by it. Not because it's ""good"", but because it presents the alternate side of the usual story of Vietnam: The jingoistic, military industrial complex side of the coin. Gone are the humanist concerns for the battlefield participants, the innocent indigenous personnel, and the traditional objectivity that one might hope for from a ""documentary"". By contrast what is being documented here is how the US government packaged and sold the Vietnam conflict to its population with the same kind of enthusiasm that Kellogg's sells corn flakes. This is one of the strangest presentations of history I have ever seen, ceaselessly upbeat, focused on victory, and completely devoid of even one shred of human decency.

AND I LOVE IT!! It's so refreshing to put this on and throw off the yoke of 30 years of Liberalist revisionism, constantly painting our military's involvement in 'Nam as some kind of humiliating defeat. The fact is that it wasn't and with a very few examples to the contrary we won practically every engagement we undertook. This collection is part of that mentality, speaking in glowing terms of the heroism of our soldiers, the devastating, unstoppable might of our mechanized juggernaut of destruction, and the destruction that we served out indiscriminately to our enemy & friend alike.

See, war is about breaking things and killing people. It's dirty, nasty, horrifying, and the only thing good that can possibly come from it is it's ending. The feeling I get watching these propaganda films is that it should have been over fairly quickly if certain unforseen events hadn't turned public sentiment against the military's freedom to wage war as they saw fit. Here is a vision of the Vietnam conflict where the war was WINNABLE, which flies in the face of everything we've ever been taught about the conflict by Hollywood, our social studies teachers, PBS & the History Channel. It's as contrary to anything someone like Walter Cronkite could have tried to spin it, and yet up until 1968 or so this is exactly the same tune he himself was singing.

You can sort of picture these short reelers playing in a theater between features, with the smug, self-satisfied white males in the audience sitting back in their seats, lighting up a fresh cigarette, and puffing along approvingly as they heard of the heroism of the 4th Infantry Division, saw first hand the might of American air power bringing the North Vietnamese Army to their knees at Khe Sanh, marveled at heroic Marines leaping into the rice paddies with their machine guns blazing or the 1st Air Cavalry advancing across LZ X-Ray at the Ia Drang Valley. If your estimation of the conflict was based upon what you saw here you'd be hard pressed to comprehend how we ended up ""losing"" in the end.

That's why I refer to it as marvelous propaganda, and on that plane of consideration should be viewed with a kind of quiet awe you usually reserve for things like seeing the Hoover Dam in person: You can't believe what you're really seeing, to a degree, and the upbeat enthusiasm of the narration will leave you puzzled for days. Yes yes, it's all probably inaccurate and insensitive and hateful and even a little bigoted, but dammit this is America at war we are talking about. It isn't going to be a Care Bear commercial and it might be useful for some to understand why our culture was so polarized by the experience then as opposed to now. Now we are sort of expected to look upon it with cynicism and distrust, but in 1967 Vietnam was shaping up to be another triumph in the American war machine. This DVD collection helps you understand why people were so confused when it didn't turn out that way.",1215993600,,3718,4.786604361370716
7899487,3,6305995834,"While the commentary and the music were a little dull, I liked the fact that it was all real footage. It was broken down into different categories and painted a vivid picture of the style of warfare used at the time..",1163030400,4,217,4.317073170731708
7899488,2,6305995834,"I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not that great. I purchased it hoping to see some actual combat footage (or any footage for that matter) taken from the vietnam war. instead, each VHS which is supposed to specfically target one fighting aspect of the U.S. in vietnam (i.e. the marines, the bombers, the navy, helicopters, etc) just shows the same footage over and over. For instance , every video shows a diving helicopter shooting rockets and B-52s dropping bombs, which is cool the first time you see it but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realized you wasted your money.",1150848000,10,595,4.622641509433962
7899489,2,6305995834,Should have red previous reviews. It's only fragments of very interestings films. But you will never see the scene in depth. It's almost a 60's American propaganda. Type of movies they used to recruit in colleges or universities. Only a one side view of the war.,1084838400,14,262,4.717391304347826
7899490,1,6305995834,"This is a horrible movie pack.  If you rented it at the library it may not be so bad, bud it is not worth no $30+. Each video has about sixty minutes on it, and it is filled with reapeating footage, obvious stories, and the rantings of one camera shy historian. What is worse is that, as I was fooled, this does not go in sequence of war (EG- 1964,1965, or the Tet Offensive). All that are in the pack are little tidbits of stuff.  You get a movie on the Marines, on the Navy, mostly brown water, and the Viet Cong to name a few.  I have read up on Vietnam, and for someone who knows a good amount, you will learn nothing from this set!",992217600,12,636,3.9921259842519685
7899491,4,6305995834,"This 3 hour documentary is exceedingly good value for money. Although the picture and sound quality are varied (I'm sure some episodes were taken from magnetic masters), the content was surprisingly refreshing in a Vietnam documentary sense. That is, this documentary seemed to have been coupled together from Military newsreel archives from the actual Vietnam conflict (pre 69, I think), and was deviod of the usual retrospective look at the war. Listening to the voice-overs, the war was already won - by the US. Some fill-in sections (to keep each episode to the 30 minute mark) was in some cases filled with un-narrated segments, but rather than adding sound effects, they had someone on a synthesizer making a pretty corn-ball ""score"" (for lack of a more accurate term describing the embarassing sounds that accompanied the images in this case). Fortunately, these segments were pretty far between. From a military equipment perspective, I actually learnt a few things from it. For starters, they showed the Marines amphibous APC, one which had a brief shot in Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", which I had previously thought was not hardware used in Vietnam. Definitely a worthy purchase for Vietnam era miliraty buffs.",970531200,21,1219,5.192893401015229
