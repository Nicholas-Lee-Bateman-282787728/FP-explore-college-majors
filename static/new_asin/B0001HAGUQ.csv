2001344,5,B0001HAGUQ,"i have reviewed many of these sets and have liked them all so i had no problem buying this set. i still can't get over the number of people who talk about the quailty of the pictures and sound. come on at 40 to 50 cents per movie what do you want. part of these old movies charm is the poor pictures and sound. the scrachs and audio pops are a part of the joy here. the ones i saw on saturday noon and late night t.v. did the same thing but i watched them anyway. as always some good some bad  and some that really can't be placed in a pigon hole movie wise.i will say my young sons sit and watch these westerns with me and love them. i has become a time to sit eat popcorn talk and cheer on the bad guys. really the fact that most of these movies are family friendly makes them an even better reason to buy this set. when was the last time your kids sat and watched a movie with you and said they liked these ""old movies"". get over it and enjoy the shows",1136332800,14,955,3.8974358974358974
2001345,2,B0001HAGUQ,"50 westerns, seems like a bargain?!  Well... maybe, depending on your tolerance for sub-par film transfers.  There are some great films here to be sure, but at least a third are pretty bad transfers, and the rest are mostly just marginal at best. Virtually all of the more commonly available films offered here can be found in significantly better quality elsewhere.

Virtually all of the half dozen or so of the films from the 1960's are total trash - you can not watch these without getting a headache - totally unwatchable!!!  For example, check out ""The Grand Duel"" starring Lee Van Cleef in the sixties - a totally washed out, blurry disaster, probably one of the very worst film transfers I have ever seen on DVD (note: a much better film transfer of this movie is available on the Platinum issued Lee Van Cleef DVD).  On the other hand, in this collection you get an early 1940's era film like Howard Hughes' ""The Outlaw"" in near pristine condition.  Most of the other films in this collection fall somewhere in between quality wise.

But, you should be aware that in most cases these same films can be found in significantly better quality in other generally superior DVD collections - see my other Amazon reviews for several examples. Check out ""Tough Guys of the West"" for a much better collection of 20 similar B-Westerns or check out any of the Platinum issued DVDs included in ""The Great American Western"" series.

Included in this collection are several commonly found Roy Rogers and Gene Autry films - however, these are mostly just copies from fuzzy VHS and as a result most of them have a slight out of focus look to them - you get used to it after awhile and you can watch them o.k., but just be warned that the quality is somewhat lower than your average VHS tape.  I have found that the Madacy or Platinum issued Roy Rogers films are generally as good and in some cases better film transfers than what you find in this collection (see my review for the Madacy issued Roy Rogers DVDs).  Also, you might want to check out the Roan Group issued DVDs for some other Roy Rogers titles not included here in this collection (see my review for more details on those great DVDs).

And then you have the Tex Ritter and Bob Steele films - these appear to be actually mastered from original 16mm or 35mm film - the only problem is that they tend to have a lot of scratches and splices at certain points.  In one Tex Ritter film the soundtrack gets out of synch with the action and talking for about 20 minutes.  But even so, you do get a reasonably sharp image direct from film instead of a third rate, fuzzy VHS copy.  And often these films run for quite a long time without any problems and when problems do pop up it's only for a minute or two - in other words, you can mostly enjoy the films without eye strain.  Even so, I will warn you that these particular early Bob Steele and Tex Ritter films are not really that great even considering the time period and the genre.  Both Tex and Bob have made better films than the ones offered in this collection - these are mostly just ""o.k."" performances - nothing great.

If you like Bob Steele you should check out a superior performance in the film credited to Roy Rogers, ""The Carson City Kid"" which is included in this collection.  This is an early Roy Rogers (pre-Dale Evans) film which co-stars Bob Steele.  ""Carson City Kid"" is very enjoyable, but again, as noted above, the transfer of the Roy Rogers films here are not very sharp (the one put out by Madacy, for example, while still not perfect, is far better than the transfer included in this collection, while the one issued by Platinum easily has the best best picture of all, but that soundtrack is easily the worst!  So, take your pick!) - but, in any case, my point is that Bob Steele's performance as the bad guy in this film is much better than the other earlier films he stars in that are included in this collection.

""Vengence Valley"" with Burt Lancaster is in color and a great movie, but the image here is not very sharp and the color is severely faded out as if copied from a VHS copy someone left on the dashboard of the car a bit too long!  I have the version issued by Platinum and it is nearly perfect with pretty good color and very sharp looking. Get the Platinum version and avoid the one in this collection!

""The Kansan"" and ""Abilene Town"" are both really great movies, but here they are both particularly fuzzy looking - again, another case of bad transfers from VHS?  ""Abilene Town"", for example, can be found in much, much better quality on the ""Tough Guys of the West"" DVD collection (see my review for ""Tough Guys of the West"").  ""The Kansan"" is also available on Alpha Video and while Alpha has a very mixed track record for some of these films, their version in this case is much better than the one in this collection - see my Amazon review).

The early John Wayne films are also a mixed bag - most are fuzzy looking, but some might actually be from film instead of VHS copies - it's hard to tell.  ""McLintock"" from 1963 is basically trash in this collection - very fuzzy and very faded color. Please also note that ""McLintock"" is being released very shortly (or has been released by the time you read this) by the John Wayne estate on DVD - you will probably want get that one!

Better film transfers of some of these early Lone Star Production John Wayne films (at least not any worse and in some cases significantly better) can found on the Roan Group DVD, ""The Early Years Collection."" I have a much better, near perfect DVD transfer of ""Angel and the Bad Man"" (from Good Times) compared to the fuzzy version you find in this set.

A couple of other films are rare in that I have never seen them offered on DVD before, so you might need to get this set for those.  ""Billy the Kid Trapped"" and ""Arizona Stagecoach"" for instance are ones I had never seen before on DVD - I found both to be very enjoyable and are from film transfers, but again with a lot of splices and scratches at various points - but still very enjoyable and very watchable.  I don't think any of the Tex Ritter films are available elsewhere.  The same Bob Steele films in this collection are also offered on Alpha Video DVDs, but I don't know if they are in any better condition on Alpha than what you find here in this collection, but my guess is you would likely be better off with the Alpha versions.

So, the bottom line is that you should get this if;
(1) You need a good copy of ""The Outlaw"" - it's the only film here that is in pristine condition.
(2) You need to have the few films that only appear in this DVD collection and nowhere else.
(3) You don't want to spend a lot of money, and don't care about quality, yet you want to sample a lot of early B-Westerns to get some idea of what the genre looks like. Actually, on second thought, you would be far, far better off in getting the 10 DVD 20 movie collection ""Tough Guys of the West"" if that is your goal.  That collection gives you a much better bargain in terms of quality than the ""50 Western Classics.""

Here's another tip for you.  If you are looking at B-Westerns for the first time you might want to check out the Hopalong Cassidy films offered by Platinium - there are 40 films total on 5 DVD volumes that you can get really cheap!  Some vendors sell these for less than two dollars a disc (each disc has 5 films on it)!  Do the math - with shipping you are looking at about $1 per film.  And they are in absolute pristine condition!  Check it out - the Hopalong Cassidy films are among the very best B-Westerns ever made.  The Red Ryder series is also available on DVD issued by VCI and I have seen most of them - they are great films with pretty good film transfers - you will not be disappointed in those.

2001346,4,B0001HAGUQ,"The premier American cinematic drama is the western, and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns. This set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot, every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side. There aren't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections.

It's true that the majority of these are b-films, and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today. There are some definite classics (McClintock, Under California Stars) along with plenty of simply enjoyable films.

Just a note, there are a few mistakes. For example, ""The Santa Fe Trail"" included on this set is *not* the 1930 Richard Arlen version. It's the 1940s Errol Flynn, Olivia Haviland version - which I personally feel is superior anyway. Also, some films were taken either directly from television (you'll see a IN STEREO flash across the screen when you play the film) or didn't transfer very well (slight distortions in video or audio) - but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal!",1102809600,48,1135,4.93717277486911

2001350,4,B0001HAGUQ,"Western Classics 50 Movie Pack

These twelve double-sided DVDs contain fifty different movies. Most of them were produced in the 1930s and 1940s, the prime time for Westerns. Twenty-five star Gene Autry, Tex Ritter, Roy Rogers, and John Wayne. The first three were singing cowboys. The other twenty-five contain a variety of other actors. If you wish to view these films which are now banned from broadcast TV, get this product. It may remind you of the television shows from the 1950s and 1960s. These films were known as ""B-pictures"", produced on a lower budget with a running time of an hour. You can compare them to the current hour-long TV shows. They represent a past culture. Then most ranches (like farms or stores) were owner-operated small businesses. No national chains or franchises. Some of these stories are set in the 19th century, others have modern settings with automobiles, telephones, and radios. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized when these films were made. Many of the stories tell of the struggle for economic independence (like the small movie studios against the big chains). The titles are listed in DVD order.

Saddle up partners for a six shooting good time with this 250 western pack of movies. Like all the other Mill Creek packs, this was as inexpensive as a cheap cup of coffee or cheap piece of candy. In this collection you get lots of big name as well as obscure name actors like John Wayne, Tex Ritter, Ken Maynard and many others. In these movies you get masked robbers, evil land barons, crooked politicians, ladies in distress, and loyal deputies and other side-kick characters. This has most of the big name western stars before they were big stars. Actors such as, John wayne and Randolph Scott in their younger days as they were just growing to legendary status. Also, you can find a lot of movies with Hoot Gibson as some kind of side-kick in one form or another. This set even has lots of Spaghetti westerns in it as well as a movie with an all African American cast. And just as I have warned before, this is pretty much all old movies with the majority of them in black and white and aren't the HD Blu-Ray modern movies of today. So, keep that in mind and you should be in western movie heaven with this set. So sit back and enjoy the ride into the sunset of western movie bliss.",1404950400,,1257,4.330508474576271

They found fault with everything, including the sound and black and white, even the introduction. I even told them that a had walked the streets of ""Old Studio"" in Tucson, AZ. just a couple of years ago where they filmed most of the old western movies, and would they like to travel to Tombstone, and Tucson and see the site.

2001370,3,B0001HAGUQ,"I purchased this set for my husband who is an avid western fan. If it has horses, guns, and cowboys he is normally pretty happy with it. When we got the movies we noticed that we had duplicate dvd's and that some were missing. We received 2 of disc 10 and 2 of disc 6. which means that we are missing disc 1 and disc 8 in the set.
One of the dvd's when I put it in the player all it says is disc error and it cannot be read on either side. It happens to be a disc that has five movies on the one disc. One of the movies when it was re-recorded onto the dvd stops in the middle of the movie and begins back at the beginning.
I expected the movies to be in black and white, this wasn't a surprise. So many people put in their reviews that is an issue. If you have movies made in the 30's and 40's they are going to be in black and white.
For the price, we still got a good array of movies, quality leaves something to be desired and of course the missed dvd's didn't make my husband very happy.

You have films like painted desert that was made in 1931 [ almost 80 years old ] and films like china 9, liberty 37 which was made in 1978 [ not quite 3 decades ]. These films allow us to actually watch the way westerns developed through the years. You get to see a young Clark Gable in a bit part as a bad guy in painted desert. There is so much more to these old films then just being remastered or the story itself. The difference in how even the western duds changed is something to smile at. Yes people dressed different. With each decade the movies changed  props & plots. I own 6 western 50 packs and think they are great, not because of how the production quality is but because of the sense of yesteryear I get when I watch them.

2001379,4,B0001HAGUQ,"I bought this Box Set from Amazon.com and I am thrilled at the sheer quantity of the movies. The 250 movies are in 60 Dual Layered DVDs packed in a lovely boxset. The collection of movies are good, however, 85% of the total movies are from classic Black & White era. There are just few colour movies in the set. Nevertheless, I got the movies which I am looking for so many years like RAWHIDE, DEATH RIDES A HORSE etc. It would have been better if the movies are listed with the DVD no on the cover of the box. The names are however written on the box but are just too small to read and the laminated box covering made it little difficult to read. Also, looking for particular movie from the set is difficult as we have to browse through every DVD to find the movie we want. I hope it will be looked into by the manufacturer. It is nevertheless a good buy and it will occupy the best place in my Western Collection. Must for any western freak - Buy it.",1238457600,2,952,4.151351351351352

2001381,4,B0001HAGUQ,"To my knowledge this is the biggest round up of western movies available in one place.  At 250 movies for the Amazon price of $65, (Its higher or lower now, but that's what I paid at the time), you're looking at just over 25 cents per movie.  Not a bad deal even if it comes out that you actually only find two thirds of them worth it.  Unfortunately that math has turned out to be correct.  A good third of the movies in this collection are extremely old oaters from the 1930s that run an average of less than 60 minutes.  They are neither very entertaining, nor of very good quality. Even if you're a fan of that early era of westerns, its my opinion you will be disappointed in any event due to the inferior quality. Most of the early ones are very dark and hard to see even with the brightness turned all the way up on your TV set.  They may be old, but they are definitely NOT remastered in any way.  Very dark and very blurry.  However considering that the vast majority of movies hail from the late 50s through the late 70s,(and are of much better viewing quality), I still recommend saddling up with this collection.  It is definitely making the long winter here go by much more enjoyably....",1232236800,11,1200,4.321428571428571

This deal is even better when you consider that many of the movies in this collection are available as individual movie DVD's at prices of $5 and higher. Many of the movies in this collection are presented in better condition than they are from other DVD companies.

2001392,5,B0001HAGUQ,"This collection is well worth the price paid. I haven't viewed all the titles, but those I have are great. As for those who complain about the ""quality"" of some of these flics, I guess it all depends on how you define ""quality"". These are old films and you can't expect them to stand up to the picture quality of more current films. If you define ""quality"" as good old fashion, wholesome, family entertainment, when there were ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", and morality, then they far surpass the trash put out from the 70's and on. I plan to buy more of these 50 movie packs and would recommend you do the same.",1174176000,16,610,4.359649122807017

2001395,5,B0001HAGUQ,"We gave this as a Christmas gift, the recipient loved it, she has alway been fond of the old western movies.",1168300800,3,108,4.190476190476191
2001396,3,B0001HAGUQ,"A real mixed bag is this lot from the 1930's to the 1980's and please don't get carried away and think that the most recent ones will be the best quality this includes most of the color films most of which are awful including this version of McCLINTOCK Talking of color probably the best one on show here is CHINA 9, LIBERTY 37 (despite the fact that I dislike Spaghetti Westerns intensely). Followed by the two Roy Rogers films BELLS OF SAN ANGELO and UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS. Both shot in Trucolor (a cheap version of Technicolor adopted by Republic) a misnomer if ever there was one.

Of the fifty films on show here we have at the top of the list Roy Rogers (10), Tex Ritter (6) John Wayne (5) Gene Autry (4) Richard Dix (2) Bob Steele (2) and all the rest are solo outings (22)

The five most viewable and interesting films for me here, all shot in black and white, were in release-date order:

BLUE STEEL 1934
An early John Wayne western with an almost serious George ""Gabby"" Hayes as the sheriff and Wayne is the wrongly accused newcomer mistaken for The Polka Dot Bandit who is played by Yakima Canutt who is also responsible for the stunts in the film including John Wayne's All in all a most likable B-Western.

JUDGE PRIEST 1934
A John Ford film starring Will Rogers in the title role as the judge in southern (Confederate) town after the war. Hardly a western at all really, but much to enjoy by this Master Director full of his usual comic touches, still raises a smile some 70 odd years later.

THE OUTLAW 1941 (Released, then withdrawn, limited release again 1943)
Billy-the-Kid is the Outlaw in question played by a young Jack Buetel. But most of the attention in this film was focused on 19 year-old Jane Russell and Director Howard Hughes, and his fixation with her ample bosom from various camera angles.  An interesting A-Western beautifully filmed plus some very clever camera work on the lightening fast gunplay.  Not fully released until 1950 to more sceptic post war audience.

THE KANSAN 1943
Richard Dix (Him of the jutting jaw fame) is elected marshal of a Kansas town, in this A-Western. Directed by George Archainbaud also staring Jane Wyatt and Victor Jory with Albert Dekker as the heavy. Excellent cinematography by Russel Haran raises it above the norm.

MY PAL TRIGGER 1946
Said to be Rogers' own favourite amongst all his movies it also well received by the critics of the day. The story is about Roy being accused of killing a highbred stallion. But not before he has put Roy's mare in foal. The foal is born whilst Roy is in jail. Later he gets to train the young stallion who turns into none other than ""Trigger"". Also starring Dale Evans and George ""Gabby"" Hayes who is once again half-serious.

Although I have seen better transfers of the following black and white westerns they're all at least worth a mention here

1. THE SANTA FE TRAIL 1943. Starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan
2. ABILENE TOWN 1946 Starring Randolph Scott and Rhonda Fleming.
3. THE ANGEL AND THE BADMAN 1946 Starring John Wayne with Harry Carey (A John Ford favourite former star) and Gail Russell. Which was John Wayne's first film as Producer and Star!

Finally most of the remaining Rogers and Autry films are okay and well worth viewing, which maybe reflects their bigger budget than the likes of say Tex Ritter etc. My three star rating here had to be repressed due to the dross, which is a great pity, if someone had the sense or care to delete the 50% or so of the rubbish on offer here and left us with the remainder which probably would have readily retailed for the same price or even better. If like me you are a western movie aficionado and buy this boxed set to view the above-mentioned 20 odd films then you shouldn't be disappointed. And at the price on offer it's a steal.",1151020800,15,3802,4.558651026392962

It is the quality that is the issue, this is a very poor job of putting these old great movies onto DVD. I am being generous in giving this set 2 stars. I rarely give something such a low rating but even at $20 which is an awesome price it is more than what this set is worth. I was definitely swayed by the positive reviews, shame on me.
