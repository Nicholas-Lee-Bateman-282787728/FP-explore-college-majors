5189227,4,B008XAT0JG,"Yep, like everyone has mentioned, the audio was synced improperly during the final scene of HOSTEL. I emailed Mill Creek Entertainment (just do a search concerning the matter) about the disc, got an immediate response about it. I was surprised with the expediency of return contact, honestly. The rep asked for my contact information in order to send a replacement, free of charge. I wasn't expecting anything to happen after that, so I ordered the individual Sony releases, and forgot about it. Surprise! Checked my mail today, to find a corrected set, along with a nice bonus nature blu-ray. I'm guessing Mill Creek is a small company, and hey, crap happens.

By the way, I've watched both presentations. There is no real difference in picture and audio quality, between the Sony and Mill Creek transfers. These are dark, grainy films. If you don't need the special features, go with this one. Nice to have both inexpensively on one disc.",1353542400,16,940,4.911949685534591
5189228,1,B008XAT0JG,"Everything that reviewers have already been saying about this set are true. Very low quality and no features. The films are highly entertaining, but this particular double feature release is horrible. Avoid.",1351987200,3,207,5.5
5189229,2,B008XAT0JG,"I thought I was getting a great deal when I ordered this. Unfortunately, this single disc double feature does not deliver the complete experience.

There are no Extras for this double feature. What you get is two movies packed in a single disc. Sure the transfer is great. It's a sure improvement from DVD but if you're looking for more than just the movies themselves, you're going to be disappointed.

Also, what the others said about the sound being problematic when Paxton goes down the train in Hostel I is true. It doesn't really alter the experience because what transpires afterwards is just a bunch of action-based scenes, no dialogue. But still, it's problematic and a definite negative factor to consider when purchasing this blu ray.

If you only want the movies and you're not into bonus materials, this should be a decent purchase for you. Otherwise, just get the separate titles complete with bonus features.",1351555200,5,923,4.903846153846154
5189230,1,B008XAT0JG,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

Seriously it is defective! In the final five minutes of the first Hostel movie when Paxton exits the train the audio goes crazy and it becomes a random mix of sounds that do not mix with the movies itself and no doubt ruins the experience imo.

I am not the only one who has this problem because other reviewers here have expressed having the same issue! I only hope that they remove these defective blu-rays from Amazon and department stores because honestly it's a massive error on Mill Creek's part but perhaps I should not be surprised.

1 star for this edition of Hostel/Hostel 2

The movies themselves are gore classics in the horror genre.

Thanks guys now please don't make the same mistake I made.",1351468800,11,726,4.553846153846154
5189231,2,B008XAT0JG,"The blu-ray was good quality. At the end of the Hostel I the audio track was off and I was very disappointed
Amazon offered me a refund. I am afraid to re-purchase the item as they all may be defective. Otherwise, I
would love to have this (in good condition) in my collection.",1350950400,9,277,4.245283018867925
5189232,2,B008XAT0JG,"If your buying this just to have, check the first movie on the last five minutes, mine had an audio track error. This is relatively new so make sure yours isn't a bad copy.",1350864000,5,172,4.088235294117647
5189233,5,B008XAT0JG,Hostel & Hostel 2 are both amazing movies. When i saw this double feature blu-ray i had to have it. If you already have the dvd you should upgrade to this double feature asap you will be happy you did the picture is perfect on blu-ray.,1349827200,4,235,4.130434782608695
5189234,1,B008XAT0JG,"Bought this a while ago finally got around to watching it. The audio was completely wrong at the end of the movie. Had the audio for director cut and nothing to do with what I was watching. I reported it to mill creek complaint dept. They said they were aware of the glitch but they couldn't help me because too much time had elapsed. They did try to offer me some unknown random blu ray to placate me. I was not trying to get something for nothing, just what I spent my hard earned money on. Im quite disappointed in the way I was treated and will not be giving this company any more of my business.",1494201600,,600,4.136752136752137

5189277,4,B008XAT0JG,"The first film was rather innovative, disturbing, and highly watchable.  It sucks you into its dark world rather quickly and keep you on the edge until the end.
The second film was ""decent"".  It tried some twists and turns that didn't work so well, but it's still worth a watch and connects to the first film well.
$5.00 for this blu ray duo pack is an AMAZING deal.  This Blu-Ray is well worth the price.  Pic quality is great and sound is really good too.  If this is still $5.00 when you're reading this and you're thinking about a purchase...don't hesitate.",1359331200,5,561,4.514851485148514

5189280,5,B008XAT0JG,"I received the Hostel/Hostel II Blu-ray just a week ago and watched both movies aware that there might be problems with the audio towards the end of the first film.  Everything was perfect with both films.  Great picture and great sound.  I guess they fixed whatever audio problems the earlier copies had, which may be why this edition was temporarily out-of-stock earlier this month (December 2012) on Amazon... they may have recalled the tainted copies.  Anyway, at $4.88 (what I paid) this was a true bargain, even with very little added features on the first film and none on the second.",1356480000,3,591,4.821782178217822
5189281,5,B008XAT0JG,First ignore all of the many people that have given these two movies very low ratings only because of the bad sound they complain about.
