8232261,4,B000YDSKXW,"When this series of atomic tests was made at Eniwetok in the Pacific, cameras were everywhere- motion picture (color and black and white), high speed, still, etc. The explosions of the three test devices were captured in just about every way imaginable. All those images were used to create a series of films documenting the events and the results of these nuclear tests. Several of those are available for viewing on some of the free online sources but this video (as of February 2014) is not. The other films focus on things like the Navy's part in Operation Sandstone, EG&G, etc. Some are in color, others only black and white. This video, as the name clearly states, focuses on the monitoring and safety of the participants from radiological hazards.

The film itself is in good condition, clear and pretty sharp, and the black and white film is intact. Soundtrack is good. The information presented in the film is interesting, if slightly naive at times. What they don't tell is that four participants suffered relatively higher exposures to the radiation, requiring skin grafts and hospitalization. Those documents are now declassified and available online, too.

In all, I would recommend this video if you are interested at all in the historical aspects of our nuclear testing.",1393027200,,1285,5.0
