2712580,5,B000LPS2PO,"I have always loved all things growing - trees, plants, flowers - the glory of spring and a new beginning; the odor of wet, decomposing leaves in the fall.  Dense shade from your own chosen varieties of trees against the heat of a summer sun.  The idea that natural protection exists in nature and can be used to advantage - natural pest control insects working from above, earthworms living in fertile, loose soil below.  The organic method was something I wanted to embrace on my own 5 acre home because it made sense to me.  Roger Swain was someone whose TV show ""The Victory Garden"" brought me into the house at 4:00 every Sunday because he knew about those things; the world of plants around us.  I found Roger's show quite by accident one Sunday, and thought it wonderful.  He was a master gardner extraordinaire, but more importantly, he was genuine, he got his hands in the soil, and when he said something, you knew he had actually done it before he started talking about it.  The visual trips through his garden, spring preparation, summer glory, fall harvest and winter snow,  listening to his down to earth wisdom regarding plants are something I miss tremendously.  Glamorous or impeccably groomed TV anchor personality he isn't.  Gasping for breath as he worked and faced the camera, he projected immense enthusiasm and energetic vigor as he spoke, all the while imparting knowledge born of years of experience as he jerked up huge carrots, shaking loose black soil away, twisting off beautiful Brandywine tomatoes, brushing aside healthy cabbage leaves to demonstrate the growing medium beneath the plant.  His was all about the nuts and bolts of gardening; a true ""child of the soil"" bringing his vast store of accumulated knowledge to others in a straightforward, no nonsense way.

So I bought this disk set because it was the only thing I could find that featured this remarkable gardner.  It is a most excellent set, taking the viewer on valuable trips through glorious gardens from coast to coast, highlighting places for us that we may never get the chance to visit for ourselves - but it is ""not"" the TV series of the ""Victory Garden"" which I looked for but did not find.  The TV series of Swain was entirely within a world of its own, and while this is the next best thing, it's not exactly what I was looking for.  This one, which also features Paul Tukey, is a wonderful set in it's own right.  While it keynotes several beautiful Pennsylvania sites,  it left out botanical pioneer John Bartram's original farm and garden, which dates back prior to the Revolution, and that did disappoint me somewhat - but I highly recommend it for those who have a passion for ""places and plants"".",1311724800,8,2707,4.73773987206823

2712582,5,B000LPS2PO,"I had met Roger Swain at the TN Mastergardeners Meeting.  He, I believe, was the one who donated a copy of People Places & Plants for their silent auction.  I did not win so I was happy to be able to purchase the set from [...].  I love it!!",1184284800,3,241,3.877551020408163

8163517,5,B000LPS2PO,"This disc set is wonderful! A garden show that provides useful and reproducible information and results in the garden - not like other garden shows that focus more on entertainment with a reality TV twist, this one is educational and fun. Both hosts are knowledgeable and have the credentials to educate folks about gardening - both flower gardens and vegetable gardens. The gardens they visit and people they meet I can contact and visit too - so I learned about all these interesting places I didn't know about!",1348963200,,513,4.840909090909091
