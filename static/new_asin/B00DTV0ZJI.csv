8597666,5,B00DTV0ZJI,"This is an original imported Japan region Blue ray Disc with soundtrack album CD deluxe package. The bluray contains the first 2 episodes of watamote in raw Japanese dialogue. It comes packaged with many exclusive extras you will not find elsewhere like diary of an unpopular girl and the musical score soundtrack as well as artwork. The bluray actually works in American bluray players so you don't have to guess if it will work or not with yours. This may or may not contain any English subtitle tracks so bear that in mind before buying. The main reason to get this is for the exclusive collector content and to support the original artists. However a new release is due this year, so if you don't have a good grasp of Japanese you should wait for the Sentai Filmworks release.",1392249600,2,780,4.618705035971223
