8574847,5,B00BWTTNEC,"We bought the same dvd aboard the White Pass train, as a memento of our journey out of Skagway. The dvd is beautifully filmed to show the immense rugged beauty along the narrow guage railway. It tells the amazing history of tragedy and accomplishment by those adventurous men who built it, mile-by-mile. It makes  you feel as if you're on the train. Wish we had seen it before our trip, as knowing more history would have enhanced our experience. If you love trains this is a must for your collection. If you're planning a trip to Alaska you need to watch this first. I'm thrilled to find it on Amazon and am going to buy several as gifts for train loving friends.",1502064000,,664,4.442622950819672
