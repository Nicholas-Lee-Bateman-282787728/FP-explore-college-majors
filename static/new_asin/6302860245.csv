times films.  If you're thinking of buying and seeing
it - don't hesitate.  But - dumbest thing happened!
I took the tape out of the box and was trying to see
what happened to my tape player since it was last
reinstalled - and I misplaced it and it hasn't turned
up again.  I may have to search for another film if
it doesn't show up soon.  BUT - the film itself is nothing
if not profound.  Love Will Conquer All !!!  Do see it !!
Hoping to find the tape soon.....",1390521600,,512,3.9223300970873787
7832142,4,6302860245,"""A Love in Germany"" is a different perspective of Nazi Germany.  We see this through the eyes of a person trying to reconstruct something that happened in a small town in Germany during WWII.  It doesn't take too long to understand that this is about a romance between a German woman and a Polish worker.  The secret affair between this slave laborer and the wife of a German officer becomes less and less a secret in the town.  What may be the most interesting aspect of the movie is the varying reactions of the different townspeople to this affair.  In fact, I felt that the best acting in the movie (all of it is good) was with the lesser role players.

The movie switches back and forth between past and present.  At first I thought that this was distracting but I came to appreciate the perspectives it added.  The movie closes with the observation that, in a media full of stories and films about Nazi Germany, this movie was offered as a more personal look at their evils.  I'd say it succeeded very well in its' purpose",1188345600,2,1028,4.454545454545454
