6871587,5,B00QJ9C70W,Finally!!! The Three Investigators are in a Region 1 format (US & CANADA). This has been titled The Secret of Terror Castle in other regions for the last couple of years. Now they changed the name for Region 1 to The Secret of Haunted Castle but it's the same movie. I watched the movie online last year but now I'm excited to own it. I grew up reading these books and owned every one of them. I enjoyed them much more than the drier Hardy Boys books. The Three Investigators were always more exciting and and the stories flowed without getting bogged down. So enjoy this movie which I feel is better than the last one Skeleton Island.,1435190400,3,635,4.389830508474576

6871589,2,B00QJ9C70W,"This had some really funky stuff in it, not something I would want my kids to watch. On top of that the adults that are in it are portrayed as mindless (with exception of the villain). Would not recommend.",1430784000,4,205,4.282051282051282
6871590,4,B00QJ9C70W,"I really liked this movie. I'm a huge fan of the Three Investigators books and even though this film didn't follow the book at all, I really enjoyed the film for what it was, just plain good fun. My 5 year old loved it. If you're over 40 and a big fan of the books you might not like this but if you're a kid at heart or have kids of your own, I think they and you will love it. The other Three Investigators movie, Skeleton Island, is pretty good too, but I liked this one more. Pick them both up!

Now if only someone would tell me why they changed the title of this film from Terror Castle to Haunted Castle? At least they didn't dub in the word 'haunted' every time the kids said the word 'terror' :)

I wish they would have continued this series. Maybe someday someone will revive it in books (U.S.) and in film.",1428624000,5,817,4.068322981366459
6871591,1,B00QJ9C70W,"I normally just accept bad movies and let them go, but after my entire family (wife AND 8 & 10 year old kids) were so put-off, I had to write a review.

Having read the Three Investigator series as a kid (and loved it), then in the last few weeks starting to re-read them to my kids (who also love them), I have to say this movie shouldn't be billed as having ANY type of relationship to The Three Investigators.

[Couple Spoiler Alerts ahead].
First, the movie barely mirrors anything in the book, and I mean anything. It gets the character names & setting correct, but throws everything else in the plot out the window. The kids act like, well, kids. I didn't expect stellar performances from them, but what I did expect in today's day and age of very good to excellent camera work and production sets was little better substance. It's storyline is pretty disjointed, with parts that need explanation glossed over and those it goes into in detail (not many) really not needed. This film crawls along at a very slow pace. Any of the suspense generated leading to the castle sequence is over in a (very) short time until the ending scenes when it blows up in a steam explosion [what? where was the steam/diamonds/castle blowing up in the books??).

In recent kids films, sometimes the deliberately injected adult humor lines are appreciated, but even Pete's ""wearing my gear protection"" exchange with the Sheriff concerning his daughter was so overblown with emphasis, badly acted and phrased, that I physically cringed. And what was going on with the clairvoyant Sheriff's daughter role? If that was to add a love interest for Pete, well.....

I know Production Companies have to make shortcuts in translation from book to film, but this film could have been so much more than it turned out to be. And with the popularity of the franchise over in Europe (way more than the States) I just can't see why someone with any sense of vision would actually release garbage like this when the potential for repeat series films based on other book titles is out there.

Overall, a massive disappointment, especially after The Skelton Island DVD (which was pretty good). I normally keep DVD's for the kids to watch over and over but they told me this morning they had no desire to see this one again, so it's getting thrown in the donate pile.",1426723200,7,2334,4.669099756690998

8691504,2,B00QJ9C70W,"Unfortunately, if you are a die-hard fan of the Three Investigators books, you may want to pass on the movie. Other than getting the names right, such as the investigators, Jupiter's Aunt Matilda and Uncle Titus, Worthington, Stephen Terrell, and Terror Castle from the first book of the series, everything else has been changed, which is a shame, as the first book in the series, ""The Secret of Terror Castle,"" is considered by many Three Investigators enthusiasts to be the best of the series. The acting is fair at best (the actor that plays Pete Crenshaw is the best of the 3I actors), and the scenes with the Sheriff and his daughter Caroline are cringe-worthy. Caroline is added into the plot as a ""love interest"" for Bob Andrews, and it really does nothing to further the story.

Perhaps Elizabeth Arthur (daughter of series creator Robert Arthur) will have enough interest to have a real ""Terror Castle"" film made; I'm sure there is still quite a bit of interest here in the States, as T3I are still very popular in Europe and Germany.",1465257600,,1043,4.730769230769231
8691505,3,B00QJ9C70W,"I believe that the company that made this didn't read the books very well, or maybe took too much liberty changing it around. Couldn't recognize  this one at the first viewing, but it is supposed to be based on the first novel. If so, they failed, badly. I refer you to the books instead, they are so much better.",1458000000,2,313,4.305084745762712
8691506,5,B00QJ9C70W,"I grew up reading the three investigators books. Taking the original story, Secret of Terror Castle, they modernized the setting, changed the story up a bit, and produced what I think was an entertaining movie.",1445212800,2,210,5.0285714285714285

It's a shame that the CHILD actors in this EXCELLENT series out-grew their character's youth. I suppose if there
ARE
any further movies in the series it'll have to be with different children... like The Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies.
Well, people DO get older. I should know. I'll be 67, next year, and LOVED both of these THREE INVESTIGATORS
movies.

VERY entertaining as a family mystery-action adventure... with elements of comedy thrown into the mix.",1437609600,7,1060,7.75206611570248
