8694628,4,B00R94RY8G,"Ben Logan (Aaron Eckhart) works for a security testing company in Belgium. His teen daughter, Amy (Liana Liberato)attends high school. One day when Ben goes to work he finds out his company is missing and never existed.

Being a former CIA agent, Ben investigates. He ends up on the lam battling the CIA, authorities, and a corporation that all want him and his daughter dead. Amy quickly goes from a snarky teen to Internet sleuth.

The film consists of a lot of double agents. The twists are shown to the audience which takes away from any mystery aspect. It is the ""Bourne"" type of film with one man against the system. This one has the addition of a daughter.

This is a fairly decent film for those who like the ""Bourne"" type of film, especially if your thirst was not satisfied with that latest 4th ""Bourne"" installment.",1431993600,,826,4.605442176870748
