8181270,5,B000NTQNRM,This is a great dvd from a professional digital painter. I can honestly say I learned a lot about environment design that I did not know before. However I was skeptical to get it because of the negative review posted here. I ran into the same problem and the dvd is NOT outdated but this is Mac's fault because they refuse to run flash on their new OS. However I contacted The Gnomon Workshop (unlike the other reviewer) and they gave me an easy workaround to get the files. This is a great tutorial and I fully recommend it!,1356048000,2,525,4.313131313131313
8181271,1,B000NTQNRM,"This DVD only works on PowerPC mac, and is unreadable on new Mac computers.  Apparently it is not a standard DVD, but requires Quicktime.  If you are running anything newer than OSX 10.2 (which came out a decade ago, in 2002), you should not purchase this DVD.

I can no longer return this item, because it is opened, even though I have no way of using it.

Buyer beware!",1352764800,2,371,4.333333333333333
8181272,5,B000NTQNRM,"If you are new to photoshop or digital matte painting this is the key item for you!! Please buy this before purchasing any other dvd on matte painting. The author explains every step of each project, he tells how it was done(photoshop tool used) and why you would use it. He also used real-time footage, which if you have any of the other DVDs you know that this is not common. You get a chance to see and understand from start to end of every project how it was done. Absolutely the best place to begin if you are interested in matte painting. :)",1206576000,7,547,4.269230769230769
