3130725,3,B0014E29TQ,"I knew going in that the reviews were decent at best, but I had some time to kill and so I gave 21 a shot. The acting was okay and the film wasn't as boring as I thought it was going to be, but the script could really have used some more work. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad (an R rating could have helped make it more believable). There just really wasn't that much to the movie. I feel that Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne were good, but they seemed to be waiting for something in the script worth the talent they both have. Not an overall waste, but I would wait for the DVD and save a few bucks.",1207958400,,608,3.9918032786885247
3130726,2,B0014E29TQ,"21 is loosely based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Down-The-House/dp/B00161ANAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Down The House</a>.  A book recommended to me time and time again by some friends of mine who like to gamble.  I never got around to reading it but the idea of counting cards to outsmart and exploit some of the greatest of all exploiters certainly interests the old corporation-hating punk still lurking deep in my soul.  So when some of those same friends wanted to see this movie, I reluctantly went along.  I say reluctantly because I'm tired of these clich twenty-something party movies with the primary goal of looking 'cool' first and foremost.  Not to mention, at this point I'm actually tired of seeing Kevin Spacey reprise his role as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lester-Burnham/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lester Burnham</a>&nbsp;again and again.  Another once great actor descending to one-dimensional self-parody.  Anyway, sometimes I walk into a movie thinking it will suck and I'm pleasantly surprised that it only sucks a little, and other times I walk into a movie thinking it will suck and it still sucks.  A day later and 21 still sucks.

To go over briefly, this is a fictionalized adaptation of the card counting scheme put together by a real-life MIT blackjack ""team"".  When I say fictionalized, I think it is to the point where the story was merely inspired by this group, as enough liberties are taken that the film becomes a Hollywood clich-ridden formulaic blockbuster.  And I really mean that in the worst way possible.  All fictional elements added are clichs; from the twists and casino thugs to the shallow and extremely unlikely characters and events.  Spacey is made to be a fool and Fishburne does his very best De Niro.  Both actors are clearly not interested in anything but going through the motions.  Kate Bosworth is a monotonous mannequin and the very talented young British actor Jim Sturgess (great in last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000ZLFALS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>) works hard but unlike Fishburne and Spacey he is probably too young to realize that his performance means nothing. Overall so much acting talent wasting their time here, slumming it in Hollywood's over-stylized shallow end.  Still, the first half of the film focused enough on the actual scheme that it worked a little bit, and from what I hear the first half was consistent with the book (other than the cast being mostly white people while the real-life MIT students were mostly Asian, why is that anyway?).  I wanted to understand more about the game they exploited and I really wanted to root for them as they take these casinos for a ride, but in the end the film turns into a weak heist film with unlikely and unbelievable twists.

The thing that perplexes me most is the money this film is making.  I even heard applause from the nearly full theater after the movie ended.  Young Australian director Robert Luketic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legally-Blonde/dp/B00005O5CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legally Blonde</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Win-a-Date-with-Tad-Hamilton/dp/0060730056/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!</a>) has style, I will give him that.  He understands what a mass audience wants and he gives them the fancy zooms and quick edits along with the loud and trendy soundtrack.  He gives them the pretty people and the cheap twists.  He makes people money and for that he isn't going anywhere for a long time, that's for sure.  I think I've seen too many films not to find this trite and worn out but maybe you haven't.  If that's the case then give it a look but otherwise this is definitely not recommended.",1207699200,10,4012,5.793867120954004
3130727,4,B0014E29TQ,"Ben Campbell (Sturgess) has a problem.  He is graduating from MIT and has been accepted to Harvard Med School, but he doesn't have the $300,000 it will cost him to attend.  Then, along comes Professor Micky Ross (Spacey).  Mickey offers him a place on his ""team"".  This team visits Las Vegas on weekends, and by counting cards makes a lot of money.  After initially refusing, Ben is swayed by the need for money and the affections of Jill Taylor (Bosworth), a member of the team.  In Vegas, Cole Williams (Fishburne), the head of security of one of the casinos is about to figure out the team's scheme.  Ben may be in for more than he bargained for.

""21"" is the fictionalized account of college kids who really did beat one of the most sophisticated anti-crime systems in Las Vegas.  The story is interesting, even if it has been Hollywoodized.  The plot points toward the end are predictable, but the fact that these kids were able to get away with this for so long sustains the interest for the majority of the movie.  Kevin Spacey is good as always, radiating intenseness.  Sturgess and Bosworth get the job done, while not providing memorable performances.  ""21"" is an interesting, enjoyable film.",1207699200,29,1202,4.721153846153846
3130728,3,B0014E29TQ,"The mistaken presumption behind this film is that fiction is more compelling than the truth, a flaw that haunts so many well-intentioned ""biopics"" and ""based-on-a-true-story"" shams. The real-life Dr. John Nash, for instance, is such a more complex human being than the bland composite of stereotypes Ron Howard served up in ""Beautiful Mind."" The film ""Coach Carter""--and perhaps ""Blow""--are the only ""true story"" flicks in recent memory that didn't grope for a fairytale ribbon to wrap reality in--the magical team ends up losing in the first round in ""Coach Carter"" (in the movie as they did in real life), and ""Blow"" dares to leave audiences unappeased as we watch poor Johnny Depp pursue his greed all the way to a life sentence in prison and permanent dissociation from his beloved daughter.

Here, though, we have a contorted plot so deeply implausible it's almost condescending. There was no crooked professor's guiding hand in Ben Mezrich's life luring him into a foreign terrain of adventure, no Bobby Knight halftime tirades in a Bellagio suite between hands, and that is exactly the thing that makes Mr. Mezrich's story, and the book upon which the film is based, so much more interesting. Furthermore, the real MIT wiz-kids began by failing--miserably, repeatedly, and hugely. Not until the fourth or fifth incarnation of the band of wiz-kids from Cambridge did the money actually start to come in.

Once again, a film with potential misses a golden opportunity at great story-telling--why not expose the MIT Team for the flawed novices they were, confronted and humbled by their own disastrous arrogance before they mustered the determination, courage and skill to overcome great adversity and rake in the dough? Curiously, the real-life ending is actually happier than the one we get in ""21,"" an opportunity that seems to have eluded the director. Instead we're spoon-fed a formula-fiction fantasy passed off as fact that oddly turns out to be monumentally less entertaining than the real story. Stick with the book--Ben Mezrich's ""Bringing Down the House."" Find it on Amazon here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Down-the-House/dp/043401124X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Down the House</a>.

3130730,1,B0014E29TQ,"I LOVE Kevin Spacey, but, let's face it, long gone are the days of 'The Usual Suspects' and 'American Beauty'.  He was one of the executive producers of the lackluster flick.
First off, Ben Campbell, the main character, is off the charts brilliant, but with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Vegas winnings he hides them in his...dorm room.  Are you kidding me??  I wouldn't have left my favorite CD's in my dorm room.  Kevin Spacey's character clearly quit gambling for a reason...and Ben barely schmoozes him at all, and convinces him to get back in.  Not believable!
Zero originality.  The old ""optimist gets in over his head, compromises himself/his integrity/morals, then loses all he gained with some hard life lessons, but is much wiser"" has been done a million times over.  Hello, The Firm, Best Laid Plan, Shallow Grave, and A Simple Plan.  Only those were really good movies.
Whoever played the lead character (of Ben Campbell) did a good acting job, though.  Kate Bosworth was underutilized.

3130731,3,B0014E29TQ,"This is a story about a kid so bright and so driven that nothing can hold him back in this life--except lack of money. Little does he know that his school has an underground black jack team that, believe it or not, practically begs him to join. After reluctantly joining, his world is turned upside down and he becomes uncomfortably familiar with the tension of trying to milk the casinos while avoiding the consequences of getting caught. The movie captures the dreadfulness of what can go wrong in such a scenario but doesn't do a good enough job of helping the viewer experience the thrills. I don't think this film connects as well as a movie like Rounders does. People that love casino games will probably see this movie regardless but I'm not sure it has what it takes to draw in the others.",1206748800,,797,4.541666666666667
3130732,2,B0014E29TQ,"There are so many misfires in the plot of ""21,"" you'd think the filmmakers would be too embarrassed to advertise it as being inspired by a true story. I didn't believe this movie for one second, and this is only partly because it tells such an implausible tale--anyone gifted with the ability to count cards would never involve themselves in a scheme this obvious, and they certainly wouldn't be stupid enough to repeatedly go to the same two or three casinos. And yet five students and a teacher from MIT do exactly that every weekend in Las Vegas playing Blackjack, a game that can easily be won, mathematically speaking. I know little about Ben Mezrich's book ""Bringing Down the House,"" and I know even less about Blackjack; all I can say is that, even if there was an MIT team that won millions by counting cards, I seriously doubt the characters in this film accurately represent the real-life members.

Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an MIT student hoping to be accepted into Harvard Medical. But he has two problems: (1) tuition and boarding alone would cost around $300,000, an amount his managerial job at an upscale clothing store would not provide; (2) despite his excellent grades, a scholarship cannot be guaranteed. He soon meets math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), who immediately picks up on Ben's superior intelligence. Almost immediately, Ben is lured into joining a secret Blackjack club led by Mickey and teamed with four other math geniuses: Jill (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira), and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). Because they're all able to count cards, they know they can beat any casino and walk away with bundles of money. Besides, it's not as if card counting is illegal. Ben reluctantly agrees to join the club, making it clear that he's only doing it to pay for his stay at Harvard.

After training him thoroughly, Ben, Mickey, and the team begin a weekend-only regiment of flying to Vegas with fake IDs and winning lots of money. Here's something I don't understand, and I mean this of both the film characters and the real life MIT Blackjack team: Why would students from Massachusetts travel all the way to Vegas when Atlantic City is much easier to get to? Never mind--let's just focus on the film. Once in the casino, the team uses a very precise system of hand signals and code words: coupling your hands behind your back means the table is hot; touching the corner of your eye means, ""We need to talk""; running your fingers through your hair is a signal to get out as fast as you can. Even words are used: ""sweet"" means that the cards are at plus sixteen; ""eggs"" means that they're at plus twelve; and so on and so forth. Every game scene actually makes the entire scheme look more obvious than clever. Even math geniuses would know to stir up the routine by employing different hand signals each and every time.

Incidentally, I've been calling these characters ""math geniuses"" only because the film tells us that that's what they are. Had we not been given this information, it would be hard to tell--the actors, while capable, never once made me believe they were any more academically well off than the average Joe. Not even Oscar winner Kevin Spacey could convince me, probably because I could focus on nothing other than how unlikable his character is; Mickey uses these students for his own financial gain, and this is for doing nothing besides ""managing"" the team. Eventually, the thrill of winning goes to Ben's head, making him unable to stop even after reaching his $300,000 goal. But as Mickey explained early on, they're in it to count, not to gamble. Ben doesn't care. At a certain point, he doesn't feel he needs Mickey anymore (for reasons I won't reveal). The rest of the team cautiously goes along with Ben, knowing that card counting is a very high-stakes game.

And this brings me to Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), a menacing casino enforcer who will gladly beat card counters in dark rooms. Maybe he's cranky because he's just about out of a job; a new image detection system is quickly making him obsolete. Or maybe he doesn't understand the uncanny ability to watch the MIT team via surveillance when they supposedly stay in different hotels each time. I certainly didn't understand it; maybe I missed something along the way. Whatever the case, Williams is on to them soon enough, meaning that Ben has to find some other way to count cards if he wants the money he feels he deserves.

This is the kind of plot that sounds a lot better than it actually is. But ""21"" works in much the same way a casino does: it blindsides you with bright lights and loud noises, ultimately leaving you poorer than when you first entered. I didn't buy any of it, not the circumstances, not the developing relationship between Ben and Jill, not the relationship between Ben and his MIT friends Miles (Josh Gad) and Cam (Sam Golzari), who are nothing more than nerdy stereotypes. I certainly didn't buy the ending, and while I can't describe it in detail, I can say that it's so implausible and silly it's a wonder no one forced the filmmakers to re-shoot it. True story or not, ""21"" is a film no one can buy into, and that's a shame because the idea behind it is actually very interesting. Card counting is a calculated system, yet the film miscalculates from start to finish. Go figure.",1206662400,15,5354,4.715811965811966

It's trying really hard to be a clever heist movie, but lacks any cleverness. Instead of seeing the characters as smart folks who are taking advantage of their brains to beat the system and build lives for themselves, they come across as bratty, naive, and dumb with no chemistry. The only reason to watch is if you live in Boston and want to see the city represented (as itself instead of a stand-in for other cities, which is rare these days) on the big screen, although even then you'll be scratching your head over how the map and locations in the film make any sense based on the reality of the city.  ;-)",1472256000,,1084,4.474747474747475

The guy need to go to Harvard and needs scholarship and ticket which is a essay that is so unique that it should be so shocking to convince the professors in the Harvard to make him hell yeah you should be in our school all right.

Seeing him so bright Kevin Spacey the professor asks him Jim Sturgess (Edward Norton look actor) to join their dream team.
They hell earn money all right at the beginning.
But at one time, Jim messed it up by not counting the cards. He took risk and loose about 200,000$ in the spot.
Being really pissed, the professor took everything away from him.
The money that he is saving about 300,000$ and the ticket to Harvard and even the position from MIT as a student.
Now he got nothing, I mean nothing.
All he got is the girl he ment at the team which is a dream of his life.
Now what he should do is a revenge and take back his lost soul.
But he has other plans and there was a secret suggestion before.
Sounds interesting?
Watch this movie for chirst sake.
It's a great film that earned around $$82,000,000 only from the Us without any star casting unknown director.",1469232000,,1745,4.175074183976261

I think the producers and writers could have made it a bit more exciting and personal. It didn't connect me to the movie or the characters since the main character was a bit aloof at times and sort of dull. There are some things to learn in the movie about probability and chance, so that made it more entertaining. There were quite a few frustrating moments in the movie as well though.

3130848,3,B0014E29TQ,"""21"" is the story of an MIT undergraduate student who is brilliant with numbers (Jim Sturgess), and he is recruited by his unscrupulous teacher (Kevin Spacey) to count cards and trick the system in order to beat black jack in the casinos of Las Vegas. The student/teacher combo is so intelligent that the crux of the plot is watching them be such geniuses that their use of math helps them beat a game of numbers. That is an impressive story, especially considering that this is true. The possibility that this could be a fascinating story is high. It is really interesting, but as another reviewer nailed it on the head, this story was a little too slick and superficial to be great.

This film really should have zeroed in on the human aspect of this story. If the tone had convinced me that this was a true story, and it had seemed really touching and human, it could have been really good. Instead, it played pretty much as a teen movie that was all about adrenaline and excitement. It had the predictable moral that they were moving too fast to survive forever. It took the familiar arc of most teen movies that things were too flashy to last and ""not all that glitters is gold."" It also featured Kevin Spacey acting a little too much like the sinister bad guy with devious motives. He was a little too easy to hate, and you could see what his just ending would be.

In any event, if this movie had been grittier, more realistic, and more human and personal, the way Fincher and Sorkin reached us in ""The Social Network,"" and the way that Van Sant, and Damon/Affleck reached us in ""Good Will Hunting,"" this could have been a pretty great movie. All good movies are human tragedies at the end of the day, perhaps with redemption at the end, but this came off as a slick and shallow teen movie that took a true story and actually made it feel like plastic fiction. It was too cliched and trite. The best of movies take fake stories and make them seem real, but it is sad to say that this one went in the opposite direction. It is also somewhat tainted by melodrama. I think I would have replaced just about all of the actors in this movie, as none of them seemed to be able to dig deep and give the movie that gritty realism it needed. What pulls this in the up direction is that it is indeed exciting and the original premise does catch your interest. Without hating the movie, I give it 2.5 stars. Don't hate me, baby.",1442880000,,2423,4.3822222222222225

3130870,4,B0014E29TQ,"21 is a heist film that stars Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Bosworth, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts, and Aaron Yoo. The film is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team as told in Bringing Down the House, the best-selling book by Ben Mezrich. The film was about the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. It was directed by Robert Luketic.

Ben Campbell may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader who is an eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits.

The film is definitely a fictionalization of a true story. The viewer get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas. This makes it for glossy and lightweight fun. Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius.",1433548800,,1675,4.713310580204778

3130872,4,B0014E29TQ,"Life experience versus book knowledge is at the heart of ""21"", which is apparently based on a true story. This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat fantastical film centers on a mathematics genius who climbs out of the womb of academia and into the fast lane of Sin City, via everyone's favorite Vegas game, Black Jack. Ben at first seems an unlikely candidate. At MIT, he has an IQ measured in light years, but he has about as much street smarts as Mister Rogers. Seems the last time he was outside of Boston was during a previous life. He hangs out with two similar like-geniuses who get A's in chemistry and physics and F's in sociability and charisma. They giggle at the local pub but have no idea how to approach any girls.

But one of his professors, a conniving mathematics professor with ulterior motives, played with sly intelligence by the incomparable Kevin Spacey, detects the computer-in-tennis-shoes in one his classes. Spacey signs him on to an underground group of Black Jack players that make money for themselves and their mentor on weekends. And they return to Boston to their ""normal"" lives of students and professor. Much of the film flip-flops between the glitz of Vegas and the snow-clad streets of Boston, similar to Rounders where the poker playing world and the law school world are contrasted.

Ben learns not only the subtleties of the game but also how to use his computer mind to discern when to bet high and when to lay low. The other members of the team act as scouts to determine which tables are ripe for action and those to be avoided. They wear disguises and use assumed names. The only thing that was a little hard to swallow was that when Ben gets to the table, he can't seem to lose. No matter how good a player may be at determining what cards have yet to be played, they don't always turn up the way you want. I might have wanted him to lose a little bit to differentiate when he won he big.

Like Rounders, Ben is flying high. He is winning hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and the team, and particularly Kevin Spacey. Until a savvy spotter (Laurence Fishburne) starts to see Ben a few times too many. And see him win one times to many. How this plays out is the best part of the film, with a good twist towards the end.

Some have complained that the movie is predictable, but I found it a breath of fresh air when compared with most of the Hollywood sub-par Vegas fair being offered today. ""21"" is far better than the likes of the ridiculously silly movie ""Lucky You"". ""21"" is well-written, mostly believable, and with an outstanding performance by Jim Sturgess who carries the whole film much like Matt Damon in Rounders. Sure, maybe it follows the typical W form of story-telling a little too closely, but I was never bored and I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. Overall a winning hand, I mean film.",1432771200,,2860,4.558365758754864

 21 is the story, based on true events, of some smart kids from MIT who take on Las Vegas.  The collegians are card counters.  Card counters can vastly increase their odds of winning at black jack, also called 21.  Card counters are the reason that casinos now use many decks at their tables.  Though perfectly legal, card counters are discouraged from playing, these days, at any casino in the world.  The kids are doing something dangerous, exciting and very lucrative.  It is hard not root for them against the cold blooded casino bosses.
 The lively young cast is led by Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth (Blue Crush).  They are supported by Laurence Fishburne as the casino heavy who comes down on them like the wrath of God.  This is foreshadowed early on in the film when Sturgess is shown strapped to a chair while Fishburne beats the tar out of him.  We know something bad is going to happen to the kids but we pull for them anyway.
 Kevin Spacey is the MIT professor who guides and mentors the kids, while taking advantage of their talent.  Spacey cant produce a poor performance.  He is genial and terrifying as the roll demands.
 This film was budgeted at $35 million and has already gathered $97 million world wide.  The people have spoken and they like this movie.  Chip in your dollars and see this four saw blade film.",1412380800,,1335,4.561181434599156

3130922,3,B0014E29TQ,"21 is about the journey of a poor, genius MIT student, Ben Campbell, who aspires to go to Harvard. His only problem is the college tuition. Although his SAT scores and 4.0 GPA are impressive, it's not enough to get him the Robinson Scholarship which would pay for all of his schooling expenses. Though he is eligible the recruiter tells him that he needs to have something special, some life experience, that sets him apart from everyone else that wants the scholarship.
This experience practically falls into his lap when his college professor, Micky Rosa (played by Kevin Spacey) invites him to enjoy his ""club"" of students who spend every weekend in Las Vegas gambling, and making a lot of money. Ben agrees to join but only until he makes enough money to pay for Harvard.
Even after he has made the money for tuition, Ben continues to gamble. However he starts getting full of himself and greedy and breaks the rules of the deal. After losing thousands of dollars Micky kicks him out of the club as well as takes all of the money that Ben had been saving for college.
What the club is doing, counting cards, isn't exactly legal and they end up with the security of the casinos after them. Ben makes a deal with the chief of the security Cole Williams, who has had it out for Micky Rosa for a long time, in order to get himself out of the mess and get everything he lost back.
The movie ends well with the last scene is of Ben telling the recruiter about his experience. The recruiter is scene to be astonished and the audience can surmise that Ben got the scholarship.
Kevin Spacey did well to play the part of the sly can conniving professor Mickey Rosa. he is also known for his parts as Hopper in The Bug's Life, Lex Luthor in Superman Returns, and Dave Harken in Horrible Bosses.
The plot line itself is interesting but they could have done more to make the movie better. For one thing, they hardly develop the other characters. You know little about even the main character, Jill, any of the other club members, or Micky Rosa. You're given a few glimpses here and there but nothing really substantial.
There's a little bit of romance between Jill and Ben but overall, not much romance. The only action occurs when Cole Williams is beating people up so not much action either. The movie does have some incredible scenes of the highlights of Las Vegas and does well to capture the energy of it all.

Character Development

The main character is the only one that exhibits any growth.

Acting

Clearly all the players were fine. Every one came off believable enough.

Overview

An effort was made here and there that just did not pay off, yet there were several wonderful long shots that really did shine. When the movie starts there is a scene that is taken from the end of the film to create a surprise of events. When this occurred the film there was no trust that the audience was going to figure out what is happening. Backtracking events and then slowly spoon feeding the audience step by step what is plainly obvious. But the real problem is the execution. It was running at snail speed. Boredom quickly set in and it never really recovered. Then there were incidences that stretch a healthy suspension of disbelief to a breaking point. One occurrence is when the protagonist hides a small fortune of money in an insecure place in his dorm room. A supposed genius would not hide over three hundred thousand dollar is such a manner. I am curious to what amount would he decide to open a bank account.",1406419200,,1148,4.598039215686274

  Terrific character development and performances, although Spacey chews up too much scenery and twirls his figurative mustache a bit too much for my taste.  Sturgess' character arc is well-developed and believable, while he maintains sympathy throughout.  Good wins in the end, but the road there is pretty rough.

It's not something that I'd EVER be able to do and I think it's interesting when people can go all 'Rain Man' and make oodles of money.

In case you're not aware, this is based on a true story, though some creative liberties have been taken with the plot.  In the end, the film is still worth watching.  Jim Sturgess is Ben Campbell, an MIT math nerd looking to go to Harvard Medical School but lacking the funds to do so.  He gets a sense of hope when his professor, played by Kevin Spacey, invites him to join a covert team of equally intelligent students who travel to Las Vegas.  According to Prof. Spacey and the team, they don't gamble...they count cards to ensure their success and subsequent profit.  Intrigued, Campbell signs up.  He is then predictably sucked in by the perks of his new life, including the hot girl who suddenly takes an interest in him.  However, this predictibility does not dampen the film but perhaps instead drives it forward as we watch Campbell's character slowly devolve until he's outright in an out-of-control downward spiral.  Again, it's a film  that takes many liberties with the events it's based on (there's a contraversy surrounding casting) but it's still worth a watch or two...or more.

3130950,3,B0014E29TQ,"Everybody and their brother (and sister too) knows by now that the current student debt crisis in America is out of hand. Kids trying to get a serious higher education that might keep them off the streets, off the public dole, and gainfully employed in someplace other than bottom- feeder Wal-mart or Mickey D's are practically becoming indentured servants to the banks and other lending agencies in order to get out from under such a fate. Over the long haul we really are going to have to promote, as a matter of public policy, of social survival policy, a program of free quality higher education for all who want to go that route. Of course that proposition today is pie-in-the-sky and is a question for the future. So what is a kid, a hard- working grind of a kid, totally committed to getting him or herself a higher education to do in the meantime ? Well, one possible solution is presented by the film under review, 21.

And that is the solution not  just the title of the movie. Basically go to Vegas (or I suppose Atlantic City or some other such gambling venue) and play 21. Simple, simply work out a system of counting cards and presto you are rich, rich enough anyway to grab that higher education. In the film it is a nerdy guy, an MIT grind, who through hard work and,well, grind has been accepted in Harvard Medical School  in order to pursue his dream of being a doctor. But he has no dough , no $300,000 price tag dough, and so it looks like no go for our young hero. Except a fairy godfather (really an MIT professor)  shows our student the way forward through working as a team with four other ""best and brightest"" to grab lots of dough ""under the radar"" with the professor's system. A system he had worked out and perfected from the days when he was a card-counter, now retired, in the old days.

Oh yeah, there is one little problem.  No, not the problem that one might get addicted to beating the odds and go overboard, begin to like the ""life"" while having tons of fun being comped and everything in Vegas (including a little fling with one of the female team members).That 's nothing. No, the problem is that those casinos in the desert (or anywhere ),well, frown on card-counters. And they are more than willing to do something about it whether you are some weary old professor or a young MIT grind. Watch the film to see what the ""they"" (led by Lawrence Fishburne) are willing to do about the problem. As for non-elite college students, non-grinds, non-math memory whizzes, or the merely timid. perhaps you should think about fighting for that social policy of  free quality higher education mentioned above.",1379116800,,2635,4.546413502109704

3130963,2,B0014E29TQ,"Dramatically this movie was okay and time moved pretty quickly while I was watching it.  However because this movie claims to be based on a true story there are 3 points I would like to make.  Point One:  Modern Las Vegas casinos do not muscle professional blackjack players anymore.  They did in the 60s but this is not the 60s.  All of the huge casinos in Las Vegas are owned by giant corporations and that is not their style.  They have a procedure for dealing with card counters and it does not involve touching them.  Occasionally a rogue employee might become hyperactive but if a complaint is filed and investigated that employee is sure to be fired.  Point Two:  Both the movie and the book imply that the reason the real team was successful is that they have MIT brains and can solve differential equations and perform quantum mechanics in microseconds.  This implication is so ridiculous it is laughable.  A card counter does not memorize cards as the urban legend maintains.  He adds and subtracts the high cards from the low cards and then divides by the number of decks remaining to be played.  If the true count (the divided by decks count) is greater than +1 the professional player has a slim advantage.  The advantage is so slim that the professional player (and professional team) will often lose and lose big on their way to long run profitability. The reason for this can be explained by statisticians - it would take too long here.  The professional player knows this but does not need to make difficult calculations to play the game.  The knowledge level of mathematics required to count cards will occur in the average person at about the age of ten.  However to actually win a professional player does have to be quick, determined, heavily bankrolled and tough - willing to play long hours and not give up.  He must be willing to sit for long hours at tables full of smokers, drunken players, bad smelling players and ignorant players making ignorant comments.  He needs to ignore bad headaches and always carry a large supply of Tylenol. Point 3:  The movie and the book imply that the actions of this team are highly original and creative.  They are not.  Virtually the same thing was done more than 50 years ago and has continued to be done right up onto this day.  There is absolutely nothing creative or original about what this team did.  A much better book on the same subject was written by a much better player named Kenny Uston more than 50 years age.

3130969,4,B0014E29TQ,"""21"" is great! This is how the story goes: The true story of the very brightest young minds in the country - and how they took Vegas for millions. Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who -- needing to pay school tuition -- finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school's most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. With unorthodox math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa leading the way, they've cracked the code. By counting cards and employing an intricate system of signals, the team can beat the casinos big time. Seduced by the money, the Vegas lifestyle, and by his smart and sexy teammate, Jill Taylor, Ben begins to push the limits. Though counting cards isn't illegal, the stakes are high, and the challenge becomes not only keeping the numbers straight, but staying one step ahead of the casinos' menacing enforcer: Cole Williams. The cast led by Jim Sturgess (as Ben Campbell), Kate Bosworth (as Jill Taylor), Laurence Fishburne (as Cole Williams), and Kevin Spacey (as Micky Rosa) is great! The directing by Robert Luketic (who also directed ""Monster-In-Law"" (2005), ""Win A Date With Tad Hamilton!"" (2004), which also starred Bosworth, & ""Legally Blonde"" (2001) is great! The screenplay (which is based on Ben Mezrich's novel ""Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions"") by Allan Loeb (who also wrote the story and screenplay to ""Things We Lost In The Fire"" (2007) & Peter Steinfield (who also did the screenplay to ""Be Cool"" (2005) is great! The music by David Sardy is great! The cinematography by Russell Carpenter (who also did the cinematography to Luketic's ""Monster-In-Law"" (2005) & ""Titanic"" (1997) is excellent! The film editing by Elliot Graham (who also did the film editing to the upcoming ""Milk"" (2008) & ""Superman Returns"" (2006), which also starred Bosworth and Spacey) is great! The casting by Francine Maisler (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Quantum Of Solace"" (2008), ""The Road"" (2008), ""The Soloist"" (2008), ""Milk"", ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), & ""Hancock"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Missy Stewart (who also did the production design to Luketic's ""Monster-In-Law"", ""Win A Date With Tad Hamilton!"", & ""Legally Blonde"") is excellent! The art direction by James F. Truesdale (who also did the art direction to ""Superhero Movie"" (2008), which came out the same day as ""21"") & Christina Ann Wilson (who also did the art direction to ""Righteous Kill"" (2008) is excellent! The set decoration by Tracey A. Doyle is excellent! The costume design by Luca Mosca (who also did the costume design to ""Vantage Point"" (2008) & ""Step Up 2 The Streets"" (2008) is great!

3130975,4,B0014E29TQ,"Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an MIT student who finishes top in his classes and is applying for a scholarship after being accepted into Harvard Medical School. We see him being interviewed as he attempts to secure the $300,000 that will enable him to enroll. Unfortunately, he's one of 76 applicants, and his rivals possess credentials similar to his own. In order to win the scholarship, he must write an essay that will dazzle the professor making the final decision.

Ben's life experience is unremarkable. He has a crush on a fellow student who is apparently hopelessly out of his reach, and his friends are geeks. He's serious and doesn't seem to have any fun, such as dating or socializing. What could he possibly write about?

That all changes when he impresses one of his professors, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), during a lecture. He's invited to become part of a team coached privately by Micky, but this has nothing to do with school. Micky teaches him how to count cards, and explains that the system is certain to beat the odds if it is correctly applied. They plan to go to Las Vegas and win enormous amounts of money. While that sounds unlikely, Micky insists that it's not gambling at all. After a visit from Jill (Kate Bosworth), at the store in which he earns $8 an hour, Ben eventually decides to join the team.

I'm sure that some of you are rolling your eyes. Can a system really beat the Vegas odds? Well, this story is based on true events, and the method of counting cards is surprisingly simple.

The title refers to both the best Blackjack hand, and the fact that Ben is about to become a 21-year-old. We see him learn how to keep the count. It begins at zero, and a point is added for cards between 2 and 5, while a point is subtracted if the dealer turns over a 10, Jack, Queen, King, or an Ace. Cards falling between 7 and 9 have no effect on the count.

The team consists of five students. Three sit at random tables to monitor the count. When the count is high, the odds favor the player over the house. The person then uses a prearranged signal and one of the remaining team members sits at the table and places large bets. A series of codewords is used to tell the high stakes player exactly what the count is. For example, ""sweet"" would mean that the count is +16, and highly favorable. The high stakes player then keeps track of the count and must have the discipline to quit when the odds are no longer favorable.

Sounds simple enough, right?

A large part of the movie is devoted to the action that takes place in Vegas. It's a glamorous lifestyle, completely different to Ben's Boston existence. If the movie works for you, you'll probably imagine yourself in that situation. The prospect of winning large amounts of money with very little risk is appealing. The risk portrayed in the movie comes in the form of casino security employee, Cole Williams (Fishburne). He's fully aware of the systems used by card-counters, as he used to do it himself. Although it's not illegal to count cards, casinos have the right to prevent people from playing at their tables. Williams has more violent methods than simply barring someone from playing, so he's the main villain in the story.

I wouldn't claim that 21 is original or unpredictable. You can probably guess some of the things that happen to Ben over the course of two hours. But, like many predictable stories, it's worth experiencing for the way in which it is told. If you are a fan of the main actors, find the thought of winning money appealing, or believe you have the abilities necessary to count cards yourself, you'll be thoroughly entertained. My favorite movie about cards is Rounders, but 21 is a close second.

I could have done without the flashbacks explaining the meaning every time a codeword was used, but that's a minor quibble.",1365292800,,3833,4.592105263157895

3130980,5,B0014E29TQ,"In this drama a relatable college student struggling with finances finds a way out of his debt through high stakes gambling.  But, is it gambling if all the participants are highly trained MIT students more than capable of counting cards?  This group of early twenties college students  were led by their professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) on several precarious trips to Las Vegas where they work in teams at the casino's black jack tables.  Interestingly enough this film is based on true events.  21 relates to the audience through the personality of its characters.  This picture uses unique camera angles and movements matching the chaotic turn of events the film takes as the characters find themselves getting lost in the tempting life style Las Vegas and gambling has to offer.  All these features in addition to the inventive rewriting of a previously done plot added greatly to the success of this film.

The first few scenes show the main character Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) struggling through typical issues of a college student including homework and balancing a part time job.  His mental ability surpasses the average college student, but his mild and modest persona makes him a very relatable character.  Campbell reveals early that he is concerned his cookie cutter life style will keep him from standing out while applying for necessary scholarships.  Perhaps this is why he is so easily convinced to join the group by a fellow member, and love interest Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), who promises him ""a thrill and more money than you could possibly imagine.""

As the gambling trips become more frequent Campbell allows his emotions towards Taylor and his own ego get involved in his decisions.  This turn in the plot is expressed well through innovated camera work.  Director Robert Luketic's slow motion panning shots of casino floors and sky views of pool parties show Campbell falling into the temptation of a dangerous lifestyle.  Quick shots and faded transitions of the team partying in night clubs and strip bars make the chaotic turning point obvious.  Life finally flips for Campbell when his relationship with the group leader, Rosa, crumbles.  He is left with the decision whether he should pick his life back up and start from scratch or continue down the dangerous road of gambling.

This colorful film shines a new light on the true events of the MIT team that mastered the art of counting cards.  Although the details of the plot and script were invented for entertainment purposes, the premise that above average college students gave casinos a run for their money remains true. The audience is brought deep into the personal lives of the main characters Campbell, Taylor and Rosa so much so that they will feel the rush of the player's successes as well as the risks and failures that each will experience.

3130985,4,B0014E29TQ,"Whether or not the movie is closely tied to a book or not, card counting did happen and maybe still does. What's not to like? Friendships are broken and reestablished, there's some payback, there's forbidden romance, there's underhanded treatment(casino) for doing a very legal thing[mob tactics], there are upstarts, there're lessons learned that are applicable to life, and there are 2 villians in the movie.

Even card counting the premise is an easy concept to grasp--even if you can't do it good enough to do it like a pro. The ending is the best ending I've seen since Enemy of the State. These people did a great job with everything; almost everything made sense; they didn't have to bend or break rules to make certain parts of the movie work. Give them credit where it is do; don't be fuddy duddies and complaining ultraconservatives.

The concept is real(there are documentaries out on it), Spacey and Fishburne were as good as ever, the lead actor plays a good turncoat wielded by ego; power; money; and fame, and the characters go very well together. The only thing is they occassionally delve into concepts that are too advanced for many without associate degrees in business, math, or the sciences to have any idea about what they are talking about(let alone, understanding them), but you don't have to and there is so much going on to counter this; it happens 2 or 3 times in a long movie.

Don't listen to what everyone is saying; they are clueless; I own the DVD; watch and pay attention the first time you watch and watch again and do the same thing; there's just too much going on to ensure that you'll get it all on one pass. Make sure you pay close attention the first couple of times that you watch, bc there are a few trippable places--if you don't pay attention.

Negatives: 1. They ""hob-knob"" in the same casinos time after time even though Mickey(Spacey) knew the dangers of card counting; (regardless of whether he lacks concern for them or not--that info cannot be known), Mickey loses(potentially) a lot of money if they get caught. So, that part just did not make sense. No wise businessman takes a significant financial loss against the business without justifying it--when all he has to do is buy a few players' bus/hotel fares as insurance(travelling to Atlantic City, NJ from MIT has to be 1/3 of the Las Vegas commute--maybe even less when you consider buses) to other casinos in another state to minimize this risk. Jump around as if robbing banks. Mississippi is an idea(probably not as sophisticated as Vegas has to be; plus, fares are cheaper, too). Why not switch locales or ,at least, make reference(in the movie) to venues in another city to show the audience that you went there?

2. At the end, they allude to a new group of card counters that encapsulates new(Ben's school friends) and the old members, but how do they accomplish this with the facial recognition software that was already implemented? They used it to recognize a disguised Ben earlier in one of their last trips.",1357862400,,3024,4.741444866920152

The movie begins with a display of cards. It is legal to count cards, but casinos will eject and ban anyone who they suspect is doing this! They want losers as customers. There is a view of Boston and a bridge over the Charles River. Ben really needs money for school. His part-time job as Asst. Manager pays $8 an hour. He celebrates his birthday with his friends. A class discusses Newton's theory and choosing a prize on a game show. One student invites Ben to a meeting about blackjack (one of the most popular card games in the world). There is a scheme to ""beat the system"". Ben is asked to join as he is good with numbers. The girl invites him to Las Vegas. The team practices at card counting in ""21"". Do casinos use extra-legal means to discourage this?

The team practices their schemes and signaling for when the deck is ""hot"" and when to scram. Ben visits an illegal gambling den for his inititation. They pass through the TSA search. We see Las Vegas from the air. [Those fancy buildings were paid for by the losses of customers.] Do those flashing lights have a physiological effect on customers? They use false identification and are warned about their behavior. Ben begins to win. [They make it look easy!] Their work is reviewed by Mickey. The players in a casino are under constant watch. Back home Ben talks to his Mom. He visits a bar with his friend and meets a girl. He spends weekends in Las Vegas, and is watched. Ben hides his money in his room, he cannot use a bank or a safety deposit box. [Does he report his winnings to the IRS?] There is an argument and another player pulls a pistol! [Is this kept out of the news?] They must cash in their chips fast! One of their team is discharged.

Ben makes an ""honest mistake"" about a 16K microchip. Is his mind on his work? ""I guess its not my night."" He didn't follow his instructions, he has to pay back his losses. Can they operate on their own? Ben likes this life. [But will Mickey drop a dime?] The casino watchmen talk about ""biometrics"". They threaten to kill Ben! Back in Boston Ben gets bad news in a letter. His stash of cash was stolen. [Are those teachers in cahoots?] Ben talks to his teacher. Can he get back in? There is another big win. They grab their chips and flee the casino watchmen. Ben was caught, Cole makes a deal with him. ""Leave the bag!"" Later Mickey meets Cole again. Back in Boston Ben asks another professor if his story ""jumps off the page""? [The rest of the story is left to your imagination.]

Parts of this story were fictionalized for dramatization. Read the better book ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. This could have been a better story, its like something is missing or out-of-sync. Was it the writer, director, or producer? It serves as a warning against the idea of winning money at gambling. The odds are against it, but a few will win because many more lose. Gambling casinos are profitable only so long as they have a monopoly and there are enough customers with money to lose. Money spent on gambling reduces spending for other businesses in the area. Its like a big business located outside of town that drains wealth away from the area.

There was nothing brilliant at that.  Maybe the innate self-confidence of MIT students made the realization of the project possible.

But I suppose if it were allowed, the casinos would drop 21 from their menu of games if they lost their advantage.

Counting is a mental activity unless you make noise or use some kind of device to keep track of memory or use some other tricks beyond pure mental activity. Playing games is a mental activity. And people believe this kind of myth that one is not allowed think while playing mind games. Don't you think that winning blackjack requires some kind of smartness? Or just anyone can win without any thinking?
It is true that the Casinos can kick anyone out of their Casinos without giving any reason. If some smart kids win them huge moneys and keep winning, they have to kick them out. But counting is not the reason.
I am tired that people will accept this Hollywood myth as truth.
Here are some quote from the internet:
---In Nevada, the courts have made it clear that card counting is legal. During a cheating case in 1983, which involved a player who was crimping cards to gain an advantage (definitely cheating), the court made an interesting statement: ""By way of contrast, a card counter -- one who uses a point system to keep track of the cards that have been played -- does not alter any of the basic features of the game. He merely uses his mental skills to take advantage of the same information that is available to all players."" As I. Nelson Rose, author of the book Gambling and the Law*, states -- ""The card counter is playing by the rules of the games, as set up by the casino regulators and the casinos themselves.""  ---[...]",1297555200,,1460,4.53030303030303

The movie did capture some of the glitz of Las Vegas, but it missed some of the actual relationships between the main characters.

Kevin Spacey's character in the book was much more fleshed out than in the movie.  At the end, the character is made almost comic with the chase scene through the casino. I felt that this portrayal of the MIT professor in the film betrayed the true nature of the real life man.

I suppose some manipulation of the romance between Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth was to be expected.  And the concoction of the Harvard Medical scholarship review was not really necessary, but strictly a Hollywood ploy.

It reminded me in parts of ""Rounders"" meets ""Good Will Hunting"". I was inspired to go to gamble in Vegas - possibly not the best take-home message, but since Vegas is so far away, one that I can live with.",1294012800,,549,4.555555555555555

So he joins to pay for medicial school. He makes more money than he needs, and meets some of his best friends while participating in the club. One night in Vages everything goes wrong and he looses it all.

3131002,4,B0014E29TQ,"Be it true or not, the story is funny. A rather impoverished student at MIT decides to accept a proposal to make some easy money, since he is good at numbers, by playing Black Jack in Las Vegas. That student will get the scholarship he needs to go to Harvard medical school that costs 300,000 US dollars. He is dragged into the black jack business by some math teacher who is using a group of students to make easy money (he gets 50% of the winnings) without being seen because he is persona non grata at all and forever in Las Vegas, though they do not know his face. That professor is of course a crook and when one night, unsettled by some riff raff with his best friends, our student, Ben, loses a lot, the professor destroys everything: he blocks him at MIT, he visits his room and steals his money that was hidden in the false ceiling, ruining at the same time his dream of Harvard, he even tells the security people that the student is back at the black jack table. But the student gets his revenge on the professor, the hard way, but he had to deal with the security boss in the casino who cheats him in his turn and he is still without any money left. But that really dazzles the Dean of Harvard Medical School who interviews him a second time: he went to Las Vegas 17 times, won the 300,000 dollars twice and they were stolen from him twice too. Apparently that is a dazzling life experience that deserves a scholarship. That film is immoral, wicked, perverted, and that student is going to be a doctor. I just hope he does not gamble with the life of his patients the same way. And yet it is fascinating because it demonstrates some people are ready to do absolutely anything to satisfy their desires, to reach their goals, to succeed, no matter what it may be. At the same time some are ready to betray anyone to get even or get revenge or just to get a profit out of these others. But are you sure you would not do that too? You can't imagine what some very decent people were able and ready to do in Nazi concentration camps just to be a Kapo, which meant they had a chance to survive longer. In some situation you cannot know what you would do. Anyway, to defeat casinos on their own ground is absolutely funny for us the spectators and must be absolutely funny for the ""gambler"" even if he has to be good with figures, which means slightly autistic, which means slightly retarded. But a rich retarded person has a lot of fun in life, provided he has a real good brother and he is ""an excellent driver"".

But I darn sure like a rowdy tale about counting cards and beating Vegas, which is why I so enjoyed 21, a fun trip of a flick about a group of M.I.T. students--led by a most unscrupulous math professor--wreaking havoc at the Vegas casinos.

The story centers around math whiz Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), a nondescript nobody with aspirations of getting accepted into Harvard Medical School.  When his mathematical prowess is discovered by the fiery professor named Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey is such a hoot) Ben's invited to join a special handful of students being trained to count cards and win some serious coin at the blackjack table.  Ben is hesitant at first, as he doesn't appreciate the moral/ethical tinge of it, but once he scores his first 21 he's like a shark smelling blood in the water.  Thus the good times roll, as the card counting team goes to class at stuffy old M.I.T. during the week, then spends weekends in Vegas winning bags of money, staying in penthouse suites, and clubbing 'til the cows come home.  Ben starts to feel invulnerable--which is exactly when the floor drops out from under him, Rosa turns on him, and he incurs the wrath of a very revenge-minded casino security boss (Laurence Fishburne).

The pacing and plot get up and go once the characters begin gaming, and it's grand entertainment to watch all the negative consequences once the fudge hits the fan.  Sturgess is fine, as is romantic interest Kate Bosworth, yet the true fun is watching Spacey and Fishburne gobble up every scene they're in.  There's a grand comeuppance to cap off this mad dash--and it's a tad over the top--yet 21 is solid Vegas gold.

Supposedly the characters are all intelligent, yet I saw nothing to indicate that they would be able to figure out how to buy a deck of cards, let alone learn how to count cards.

Who was in charge of casting this film? Jim Sturgess either had a terrible accent coach or is just a terrible student. Either way it is distracting how his accent goes back and forth between an American one and a British one. I can't believe they kept him in the role with this problem. I don't care where the actor for a role is from, but they need to be able to do the accent of the character. He is also a bland actor and there is nothing remarkable about him.

I also don't understand the casting of Kate Bosworth. She is neither a great actress nor a beautiful one. Every time she was on screen I expected her to collapse due to malnutrition. She was not capable of bringing a single emotion to the surface. She just walked around looking blank. The lack of acting ability makes me wonder how she gets cast in films at all.

But Ben has a special skill that might make it possible to cover his bills and then some. It turns out he's a genius when it comes to numbers, and it is this talent that brings him to the attention of Micky Rosa, Ben's professor at MIT, who has come up with what he believes is a full proof system for winning at blackjack.  Rosa invites Ben to become a part of a handpicked team of similarly gifted students who are getting some extracurricular lessons in how to beat the house at 21.  Ben is, at first, reluctant to sign on to what seems like a morally questionable enterprise, but the lure of easy money and the appeal to his ego finally win him over.  So off to Vegas they go to put their system into play.  But can a clean-cut, wholesome boy like Ben stay true to his goals and principles once he`s had a taste of life in the fast lane?

Based on a true story, ""21,"" directed by Robert Luketic, is a slick, superficial, well-oiled crowd-pleaser that holds one's attention while it's playing itself out but doesn't provide much food for thought or emotional resonance after it`s over.  Jim Sturgess makes for an appealing protagonist as the acceptance-craving Ben, but the real acting here is done by  Kevin Spacey as the odious professor who uses blackmail and bribery to keep his minions in line, and  Laurence Fishburne as a head of casino security who may turn out to be the one serious impediment to the team`s success.  The script fails to make the card-game esoterica comprehensible for the lay audience - we're forced to accept way too much of it on faith - but hardcore gamblers will probably be taking notes for future pointers.

3131020,2,B0014E29TQ,"A fact-based drama ""21"" should have been much more engaging than it is. There is potential for more thought-provoking drama or more intelligent thriller, but somehow the filmmakers failed to notice that, making the whole story very superficial. ""21"" tries to satisfy all the viewers with its ""neat"" ending. It shouldn't have. It has ruined one of the most interesting real-life stories I've ever heard.

The story is this: ""Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions"" by Ben Mezrich"" upon which the film is based. I was intrigued by the story (the book title says it all), which seemed so interesting. However, the film was a huge disappointment.

While the script of ""21"" starts promisingly enough, with a struggling MIT student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who is recruited to join a team of gifted students, the film soon loses grip and disintegrates into a preachy, humorless melodrama. Kevin Spacey appears as a charismatic MIT professor organizing the team of students, who fly to Las Vegas and make money using the ""card counting"" skills. His slightly mysterious character interests us at first, but soon slips back into a predictable role in a typically Hollywood fashion.

So what went wrong? It is the script. Somewhere in the process of translating the book into a screenplay, something is gone. Perhaps it is moral ambivalence. Perhaps smart thriller. What we got instead is romance, which only slows down the pace, and clichd narrative devices that are so obvious and clearly out of place in this fascinating real-life story. I've never been to Las Vegas, but I don't think the casino securities would treat the guests - even though they are ""card counters"" - in the way Laurence Fishburne's character does.

Ben Campbell (Sturgiss) is brilliant but broke. A star student at MIT, he's worried about how he (and his single mom) will pay for medical school in a year. He's working a job at a men's clothing store, but it doesn't begin to put a dent in what his tuition will cost.

One of his teachers, Mickey Rosa (Spacey), notices Ben's uncanny ability with figures. Mickey invites Ben to join his select group of Vegas card-counters, and then the story starts to cook. Jill Taylor (Bosworth) is also part of the group, providing a love interest for our young protagonist, and pretty soon, the students and their wayward professor are living high on the hog in Sin City.

While based on the factual account of extremely bright card counters who devised a system capable of generating a very favorable win ratio in Black Jack, 21 delivers very little of that true story. Instead, it focuses on sensationalizing elements of the story and dramatically over simplifying others. It provides a glamorous but empty portrayal of characters who in real life were very interesting and intelligent.

Card counting, as represented in this movie, hardly requires anything more than an average IQ and the ability to count quickly, not the gifted mind of a top MIT student. Frankly, this has been simplified so that the viewer is able to grasp the key concepts; not a bad idea in itself since not everyone is a gifted mathematician, but they've gone too far and left the viewer wondering what, if anything, makes the protagonist Ben Campbell or any of his cohorts special. As portrayed in 21, it seems that anyone could practice counting cards in their basements for several months and then go make unlimited amounts of money in Vegas. There are ways to make material accessible to the audience without over simplifying it to the level of silliness.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/B00008UALL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>&nbsp;is a good example of how to do this tastefully.

Over simplification is not the only issue in 21. Other elements have been made glamorous where unnecessary, sometimes with a level of implausibility that is laughable. The worst of these would require providing spoilers, but there are a few worth mentioning. First, these wildly intelligent card counters, led by a street-smart proffer played by a well cast Kevin Spacey, are always frequenting night clubs, sleeping in luxury casino penthouses, and in general drawing massive amounts of attention to themselves, all while purportedly trying to stay under the radar of the Casinos and their eye-in-the-sky security experts. This is ridiculous. Not even Lawrence Fishburn's entirely convincing and frightening portrayal of an old-school casino security chief can save this movie from dreary implausibility. Second, the interplay between the students are based on silly cliche. These same 'brilliant' students cannot seem to remember their own basic set of rules, or even follow basic Black Jack strategy when they are either fatigued, angry, etc... That is a blatant, undercutting reversal of what is supposed to make them who they are: an icy ability to calculate odds and stick to a system.

Spacey and Fishburn make the movie less of an ordeal, but they're not enough to save this one from itself. Some of the dialogue is pretty interesting, especially the interplay between the protagonist Ben and his cut-throat professor. The psychological underpinnings of the relationships between Ben, the professor, and the former premier card counter whom Ben has supplanted could have been a dramatic gold mine, but these interactions are left on the sidelines in a movie more concerned about driving the plot forward than telling a great story.

Overall, 21 is worth watching simply because its the next closest thing to the excellent book on which it is based. This is a rent not a buy. 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 because of Spacey and Fishburn.",1229904000,3,3653,5.529516994633274

Plot: This guy needs $300k for Harvard Medical School. He has an $8/hour job. Spacey's character is a teacher who invites him to count cards at blackjack and go to Vegas to win some cash. The students use hand signals to say whether a table is hot or cold (one of the hand signals is really obvious it almost looks like a baseball play). Small twists and turns exist that make the movie not incredibly obvious to watch. The acting is just so-so and there were no incredibly cool, whiz kid, ""ballin"" scenes.

3131034,3,B0014E29TQ,"Maths and card-playing do not seem to be subjects to light up the screen with energy, but the director here has a fair stab at doing just that.
`Inspired' by a true story, an epithet which presumably allows them great license with the facts, we follow the seemingly nerdy but brilliant Ben Campbell.  He is an MIT student desperate to get funds for his Harvard aspirations, and falls in with a group of students who win large amounts of money by `card-counting' at Blackjack in Vegas, led by their maths professor (Kevin Spacey).  We see his gradual corruption as the girls, money and high rolling lifestyle lure him to push himself further.  And then of course, things start to unravel.  Unfortunately, the story does not explore the moral murkiness of the events very far, and still manages to drag things out just a little longer than it might have.  Still, the pace is peppy, the direction as energetic as the subject can let it be, showing an improvement on the director's previous fare `Mother-in-Law' and `Win a date with Ted Hamilton', and has a decent soundtrack to keep momentum up.
The cast all perform acceptably, with Kevin Spacey hardly stretching himself but still successfully filling out an important part.  Kate Bosworth looks stunning no matter which disguise she is wearing, and Jim Sturgess as Ben makes the transition from nave nerdy wannabe to cocky highroller and finally to `wiser-than-his-years' young man.
All told, a young sexy cast, veteran actor for gravitas, and a soupcon of moral ambiguity make for an entertaining and worthwhile couple of hours, but falls short of being inherently memorable.  (6/10)",1228780800,,1634,4.9416058394160585
3131035,3,B0014E29TQ,"In the long running tradition of films that lack substance yet make up for it in fun, `21' works quite well, delivering a thrill ride movie experience that is entertaining and engaging even if it is nothing we haven't already seen a hundred times before.  With palatable performances and a decent flow of action, `21' tries very hard to reach its target audience (rebellious teenagers) and in that regard it hits the nail on the head.  If you are looking for a more intelligent look at this true story then you may be let down, since this movie is purely superficial and exists only to rake in the money.

The film tells the story of math genius Ben Campbell who's dreams of getting into college ride on the chance to snag a scholarship, a scholarship that he deserves but most likely won't receive.  His mother has saved up all her money to give him for tuition, but he doesn't want to take her savings (he's a saint of sorts).  That's when he gets a proposition, to join a secret team of similar math geniuses who train to count cards and then let loose in Vegas under the watchful eye of their professor Micky Rosa.

So the film is really little more than a small group of good looking teens gambling and drinking and partying.

Like I said; money maker.

I really felt that `21' would have a little more substance, beings that the story is so engaging, but they totally went the sell out route with this one, making it nothing more than a random collage of everything you would find in a teen movie.  That isn't to say it isn't entertaining, because it is, but it's the type of pointless entertainment you can find almost anywhere.  They try and play the whole morality card, but even that attempt is halfhearted and feels a little dead.

The performances are actually pretty good, especially from the older actors in the film.  Kevin Spacey is pitch-perfect as the `hidden agenda ridden' professor Rosa, and Laurence Fishburne (who I tend to find stiff) is flawless as the hard edged security man trying to hunt down the casino's heavy hitters.  The group of youngsters is pretty decent, standouts being Sturgess and Yoo.  I usually really like Bosworth (I adored her breakout performance in `Blue Crush') but here she is stale to me.

This is not your typical biopic; it's your typical teen Blockbuster.  Watch it for the sheer entertainment value but don't expect to really care too much.  There is a slew of much better, far richer Blockbuster fare released this very year.  Even the superhero movies released this year have more depth than this missed opportunity.",1228694400,,2573,4.642384105960265

3131039,3,B0014E29TQ,"I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.

There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.

Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an ""8"" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.

Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up ""card counters"" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.

So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay.",1226880000,,2258,4.5816831683168315
3131040,3,B0014E29TQ,"Many of the other reviews talk about the storyline but I am writing this just as one man's opinion.  21 was a fun movie to watch.  There is nothing extremely captivating about the movie.  I was honestly more enthusiastic to watch the movie than I should have been.  Something about the story line of going to Vegas to beat the odds is fun and it gets the addreniline pumping even as you watch but in the end you know it will come crashing down.

The bottom line about this movie is that it has a decent story line and is entertaining.  3 stars is a perfect rating because although I would recommend it to most people, if you have something else you have been really wanting to buy then buy that movie instead of 21",1226361600,,714,4.2518518518518515

On a positive note, this movie was cute and the acting was great.  I love Kevin Spacey.  The ending had a couple of twists and turns that I didn't see coming, and it made me smile at the end.

On the other hand, it was just a little ho-hum.  Nothing spectacular.  I think it could have been a little more exciting and visual.",1225152000,,450,4.114942528735632

3131044,3,B0014E29TQ,"The movie is based on a true story, but the plot is changed so much from the book, it is hardly recognizeable. The movie captures the excitement of the team counting cards in Vegas, but the characters are unbelievable. Kevin Spacey plays a vindictive professor who organizes the team. Spacey does a competent job, but the character's motivations are so over the top that it is unbelievable he's never been caught or he can keep his job as a professor at MIT. Sturgess plays a very smart student trying to make some money because he was accepted into Havard Med. School. The timeline is very confusing. Is the whole story a flashback? However, I thought the essay is what kicked the plot off. The love story is not very convincing or interesting. Also, these Vegas trips were business trips for these students. According to the accounts I read, they did not regularly go to strip clubs. They went on overnight trips. They did not have time to for all the partying in the movie.

The aspects of the movie I liked best was how they showed the signaling and card counting working. The gambling was done well. The scenes of college life were good.

In summary, it is not a horrible movie, but it could have been so much better. The real story is fascinating. The movie only partially generates that excitement.",1223942400,9,1305,4.620689655172414
3131045,1,B0014E29TQ,"This movie's fatal flaw is that it never addresses the obvious solutions to any of the myriad problems it poses.  The question in my review title is hypothetical; I realize that if the main character had gotten a student loan for medical school, the plot wouldn't have been possible.  However, the movie asks us to suspend disbelief far too many times, and in completely unrealistic ways.  The idea of student loans is never even MENTIONED and we're supposed to believe that a smart MIT student like the one played by Jim Sturgess has no other way of paying for Harvard Med.  If that's the case, how the hell did he pay for an expensive school like MIT in the first place?  We're also supposed to believe that these smart people who KNOW they're being watched are intelligent enough to put on fake-looking mustaches and wigs (Though not the ethnic kids; I guess if you're not white it's assumed that no one could possibly remember your face anyhow.) but not to change their totally obvious hand signals.  Then there's the part where we're supposed to believe that their otherwise cool and collected leader would change his mind about gambling just in time for a key plot twist strictly on the basis of a sixty second conversation.  Oh and of course everything wraps itself up in a neat little bow.

In a way I'm biased, because I knew I would hate this movie from the moment it began.  Sturgess is a likable enough actor, but his narration never worked for me.  Throughout the movie he keeps repeating the phrase ""Winner, winner chicken dinner"" -- and even though he explains it, it makes about as much sense as any of the other plot holes in this crappy movie.

I don't care how big of a Kevin Spacey fan you used to be.  There is no reason on earth to see this movie.  Everything from the ending to the ""twist"" to the soundtrack is 100% predictable, and you (obviously) don't have to be an MIT student to figure it out.",1223769600,7,1921,4.517341040462428

3131054,4,B0014E29TQ,"The world of Vegas often has the tendencies to become highly stylized once it is put to film and of course the town itself can walk the walk and talk the talk.  But it is up to the writer(s) and director whether or not the story will have the preverbial stones to be paired up with the ""City of Sin"". And fortuneatly for the team that has brought us 21, they seemed to know when to hit the gas on the glitz and glamour that is the Vegas lifestyle, but also knew when to pull the throttle back when it was time to bring the viewer and the players back to reality. The formula for the film is quite simple and a story is one that could be recognized quite quickly if one had heard or read the book Bringing Down the House.  Certaintly details had been modified to fit the rags to riches three act structure, but the song and dance remains nearly identical.

Ben(Jim Sturgess), portrays the painfully shy MIT senior that is scrambling for a way to afford Harvard Medical School after he graduates.  His near minimum wage job isn't cutting it, but his grades and standout performances in class do so enough to catch the attention of his cunning statistics professor(Kevin Spacey).  Soon Ben is offered a spot on a team of MIT students led by the Professor Spacey who spend their weekends counting cards in Las Vegas and walking home with enough money to pay the average four-year student loan.  Ben reluctantly accepts the position as a ""means to an end"" to pay his way through medical school.  Of course, business starts off well, but soon after Ben becomes subject to the lifestyle that Sin City has to offer and begins to lose track of his home life.  And with an ""eye in the sky""( played by an indimidating Laurence Fishbourne) onto the team's scheme, Ben's world quickly falls apart as quickly as the house of cards it was built upon.  The standard formula of loose ends are tied up by the end but that should not deter the viewer from becoming wrapped up in the life of Ben and his cohorts.

The supporting cast play their parts respectively, however furthering some character quirks may of been able to take some of the load off of newcomer Sturgess. But these few flaws are not nearly enough to take away the fun and excitement that  21 was able to provide for me, and easily left me longing for a trip to the Strip for some ""heavy action"". And for that reason alone, the film should hit it's mark for the popcorn-loving viewer.",1221091200,,2432,4.430493273542601

This is a rental unless you have a heavy interest in this  take on the six M.I.T. students that counted cards and won millions of dollars from the Vegas casinos. Although certainly worth a look I didn't feel surprised or impressed by anything in the movie. It just seemed like mostly a rehash of ""Oceans Eleven"" with college students.

Apparently, Ben Mezrich's fantastic, non-fictional account of beating the house -- for real -- in the mid-nineties was not good enough for the makers of this film.

For some incomprehensible reason, they took a fascinating real-life story, glammed it up, time-shifted it to the present day, packed it full of tired cliches and overused plot devices, and baked up what we have here -- a totally unbelievable, totally silly exercise in film frustration.

Even good actors cannot save a terrible script.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?  This could have been so smart, so good, just like the freaking book...

And by the way, the classroom exercise early in the film about a gameshow host and opening the doors makes absolutely no sense to me or my wife.  Knowing what's behind the third door does not help you decide which of the two remaining doors is preferred.  After door three is opened, the original choice of door number one becomes no more or less likely to win than door number two.

Kevin Spacey gives a fine performance as the professor in question, who sucks in a group of gifted students in his scheme to make gazillions of dollars in Vegas via card counting at 21.  Jim Sturgess, the newest team member, turns out to be the smartest but also the most desperate, and it becomes clear that excitement, alcohol, and complacency can wear down even the most serious card-counters.

The lead is played by Jim Sturgess, who impressed me in Across The Universe, but here I could hear his English accent bleed out with every other word.

3131081,3,B0014E29TQ,"Based on the novel ""Bringing Down the House"", ""21"" is about five M.I.T students who, along with their teacher (who is ringleader), concoct a plan to count cards, forming a secret ""study"" group where they practice their skills and signals before heading to the big stage of Las Vegas. Ben first rejects, and then ultimately accepts the invitation to join, for the reason of getting enough money to get to med school. Ben, who wows his instructor (Kevin Spacey) with his knowledge of numbers and probability, quickly becomes the leader for the group, but once in Vegas, becomes seduced by the glamour, thrill and rush it brings. He becomes a polar opposite person from his mundane, nerdy existence in Boston, where his two friends begin to suspect that something has changed him. Ben forgets advice given to him by his instructor of not giving into his emotions, that their plan is not to gamble, but to count. Predictably, Ben falls for one of the girls in his study group (Jill), betrays his friends, and becomes reckless; all the while the eye in the sky (Laurence Fishborne) is watching his group on surveillance. Without giving too much away, the focus shifts to what will happen if and when the group gets caught, will Ben save his friendship, and will he be able to save enough for med school.

While the story is interesting, plot logic and obvious and blatant embellishment of the M.I.T story (which it is based on) gets so far-fetched that the movie may be rendered partial fantasy. For one, why did the group decide to go to the same casino every time, with the same head of security (Fishborne) watching him from above? Being that Las Vegas has at least twenty casinos, you would think these whiz kids would catch on to that. Also, I was a bit perplexed by Fishborne's character ""roughing up"" guys who he suspected were counting, as if he were some mafia boss. As far as I know, counting cards is frowned upon, and you might get asked to leave, but not illegal, and security certainly wouldn't come barreling out of their office full force and tackle suspecting counters, taking them up to their office to beat up. (If I'm wrong, enlighten me). Another criticism is the overacting. Not only does Fishborne's character borders on lunacy, but Kevin Spacey's does also, being way over the top as well, spewing out instructions and threats to anyone turning their backs on him, or failing to carry out his plan. The ending was a bit logic-defying as well, only dreamed up in a screenplay, not in real life. It seems to me that if the writers/directors would have done a little more homework on this subject, the movie might have been spared some walloping by critics.

All in all, it was a mixed bag. The idea of teams going to Vegas to try to beat the system is an engaging one, and the psychology and thrill of the game is what kept my interest. If you are too much of realist, you might be a little disappointed. Normally logic in film is my pet peeve, but I was able to set it aside just because I found the subject fascinating, and despite several flaws, it was a fun film that was well-paced and held my attention. It's also the kind of flick that will get people talking after they see it, which is usually a good thing.

Don't listen to the bad reviews here. Wow, so many of them. Apparently they are out to pick movies apart and point out all the minor flaws.

""21"" is based off the book, ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. Yes, it is a true story. No, the movie obviously doesnt follow the book exactly. They want to make money like everyone else. The movie is all ""hollywood"" with cons, set ups, snappy lines and hot chicks! Yes, alot of the movie is made up, who cares, its a movie and a good one.

I've read the first 100 pages of ""Bringing Down the House"", its similar to the movie, but not as much fun. In the book, the teacher and most if not all the students are Asian! The book couldn't keep my attention, but the movie is alot of fun.

Dont pass up ""21"" based on the bad reviews, Kevin Spacey is great, Laurence Fishburne is well Laurence Fishburne and Jim Sturgess is excellent!",1217116800,5,899,4.239766081871345
3131084,4,B0014E29TQ,"Films about gambling and Las Vegas in particular have always held a certain fascination with the public, culminating with perhaps the ultimate Vegas movie OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But this week we have a release of a film that takes the Vegas movie a whole new direction. Most stunning of all is that it is in part based on a true story.

TWENTY ONE is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), a struggling student at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) who has hopes of attending Harvard Med School. A grade A student with a 4.0 average, Ben is interviewed for a full ride scholarship. All he has to do is present an essay describing a life experience that sets him out above the other several hundred students applying. The problem is he has nearly no life experience.

That all changes when he starts a class taught by Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). During the class, Rosa notices Ben's aptitude with numbers and mathematical equations. In turn, he invites him to join a select group of students Rosa has put together. The reason? Using the technique of counting cards, they plan to make a mint in Vegas at the blackjack tables.

At first hesitant to do so, Ben finally comes around and joins the group which consists of Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). The group learns to not only count cards, they put together a set of signals to let the lead player know which tables are hot and when to move on. When they have it down, they become Vegas bound.

It runs like clockwork. The tables return them all a tidy profit and back to school they go, only to return weekend after weekend. Along the way a romance develops between Ben and Jill, Choi continues to pilfer tiny items everywhere he goes and Fisher places the entire project in jeopardy with a drunken night at the tables. The result is Fisher gets booted and Ben becomes the big cheese.

With money coming in like never before, the rush of taking on the tables in Vegas and finding love at last, Ben's life changes but not for the better. Grades become a thing of the past as do his friends. His focus becomes making more and more money until he takes a chance he can't come back from.

A bad night at the tables results in Micky cutting Ben lose and leaving the team in their hotel room alone. Making the decision to go it alone, Ben gets caught by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), the head of security for the hotel casino. Not only does he get caught, Cole has a grudge against an old gambler he lost years ago...named Micky Rosa.

The twists and turns at the end of the film along with the build up from the start make this a compelling movie that holds your attention from the starting gate. Ben's life riding a roller coaster of lows, highs and a return to the lows makes for an interesting tale that turned out much better than I expected.

All performances seen in this flick are totally believable from the leads to the secondary characters. While Spacey may have been the ""name above the title"" in getting this movie made, he doesn't take center stage here, instead opting to work with the ensemble and that is to the benefit of the film.

Based on the true story of a group of MIT students who actually did take Vegas for a ton of money, though not nearly in the same way shown here for dramatic effect, the film is certain to get the hopes up of gamblers seeking a way to beat the bank. Don't get caught up in that notion as the house is always the favorite. Instead, get caught up in the tale of a group of students led by a charismatic teacher who take a gamble and end up getting more than they bargained for.",1217030400,25,3648,4.449101796407185
3131085,1,B0014E29TQ,"Evidently, MIT teaches math geniuses to cheat Vegas as follows:
1) Show up with, party with, and sit next to your cheating buddies at every casino every time you show up
2) Never change your signals; use the same ones every week
3) Pick hair styles and clothes to draw attention to yourself.
4) Store your money in the ceiling (evidently MIT seniors have never heard of mutual funds or money markets....or maybe they just don't have those in Massachusetts yet).

Or perhaps the more logical explanation is this:  the screenwriters for this film have absolutely no clue as to what they are doing.  Even Spacey's math lectures were idiotic.  His topics featured concepts typical in an honors high school course, not in a senior MIT course.  He also changed topics every couple of minutes and the new topic had NOTHING to do with the one he was just discussing (Newtons method for approximating roots to difficult non-linear equations led to the three door probability problem...huh?)
And did anybody notice that everything the kids did was actually legal?  The ONLY thing the casinos can do (and this is actually what the real casinos did) is force the kids to leave (with their earnings) and not come back.

And Ive finally come to the conclusion that Spacey can only play one role.  He has played the SAME character in nearly every movie he has done.  And this one has career killer written all over it.",1216944000,3,1403,4.717213114754099
3131086,3,B0014E29TQ,"Many critics have found the movie distressed and compromised by the lack of vitality that should be excited by any movie that has Vegas as its stage. Indeed they do not overdraw from a tale that rehearses the usual rut of a good guy forced by circumstances to use his talents to an immoral strain so as to keep up with the rest of the world. The story is based on the book ""Bringing Down the House"", about the experiences of MIT student Jeff Ma and his team of gambling buddies, yet it deals with situations that both add and detract from the truth and the fiction alike. In the process of translating the narrative as a movie script the story absorbs qualities that feel jaded and ordinary by Hollywood standards, and the sensationalism of the story is depressed by the memory of Ocean's 11 and Casino, movies that have raised the stakes so high 21 flops by comparison. Not to mention the radically simplified version of the ""cheating"" strategy employed by the students, which seems to be so arithmatically feasible that one wonders why it does not happen more often. And by the way it does happen but to say that it is possible is not saying anything beyond the dreamy subtitle of a Vegas trip.

The movie does have numerous redemptive qualities, some of which have been so indiscreetly dealt with by most critics it gives credit to the theatregoers who simply discuss movies for fun and not as a professional happenstance. The movie has a subpolt filthy rich with a wealth of psychology that it is unfortunate the leading role went to Jim Sturgess. The star of the team of brains that ""plays"" the casinos is frightful to watch. This is undoubtedly the worst acting in a leading role in a long time. Emotionally he is a dud; his intelligence never shines through; his panache is invisible; his anxiety mechanical; and his attraction for Jill is melodramatic without the hint of affection and as if it were not enough, his supposed timidity is something we deduce more so by hearsay than by any true acting merit. If reminded of another Boston genius played by Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"" we realize how bad the performance is. And he stands alongside Kevin Spacey, who is in top form as a math professor that recruits the students and schools them on how to take down the house. The wry sarcasm, the coiled irony and the implacable cynicism we have come to admire is delivered with taste as always. He elicits well the emotional farce of a stigmatized, pulverizing, insensitive, crass, demoniacal soulless leader that corrupts and avenges without any notion of a limit ever being entertained. Spacey is fabulous and Laurence Fishburne is far too good for the role dealt him, but as all great actors have time and again reminded us, there is no such thing as a small role. He practically takes over the movie. His struggles and fears, the demons of the past that haunt him and the vengence he craves as a anodyne to a tarrying heartache is impressive. His psychosis is balanced just enough to climax with irresistable loathsomeness, all the while rendered so vitally sympathethic we end up siding with him, to some extent, only to be reminded by the plot that we should not have according to script. And what about Jill? yes the genius gal who is second shafted because of gender by the math prof, she seduces the audience, even Ben (although the acting made us wonder quite a bit). Kate Bosworth emotionally composed performance fits well with the directive of her role. This film reunites her with co-star/director Kevin Spacey and director Robert Luketic. She demonstrates the maturity of an actress scintillatingly beyond the clammy classless fixture of her romantic counterpart. She admonishes Ben on several occassions thereby functioning as a alloy to his instinct and as a monition of conscience, which all american movies must support in some way so as to be rated PG-13, as this one is. Not a scene where she becomes sexy merely by physical disclosure, rather she is sensual because of her aloof poignant approach to rational stirrings. She evades close-ups, she dashes through frames as if by impetus and never loses the momentum claimed from the moment she enters the intricacies of the drama. She deserves a better mate, but the role of Ben is an excessively demanding character to do justice to.

The outstanding quality of the movie resides in its exploration of the reason/emotion dichotomy. The two spheres seem to be mutually-exclusive until we do indeed approach Shakespearean heights that defy any such garbled psychology. We are brought to economize the sentimental pragmatism that is required of such a narrative by tracing the vulnerability that such a distinction isolates. Please watch the movie again, those of you who've failed to illuminate this aspect of a trajectory that takes us card after card unto a universe where rational dictates are full force countermanded by emotional traces, and the two domains clash and clang to a barely audible cacophany that goes beyond the moral lithanies we often impose on the ethics of a movie. Here there is no such thing. We see Lady MacBeth, we see Iago, we see Othello. There have been few movies that have been able to unearth the benumbing force that these separate universes betray. 21 succeeds in this, more so than the book on which it is based. And the performances of Spacey, Fishburne, Bosworth, and not least Jacob Pitts in the role of Fisher make it a flick worth viewing. The last actor in the aforementioned list, Jacob Pitts, sidled into a minor role that is played flawlessly that storms about with thunderous energy.

21 has fertile layers, that if one is willing to explore, will yield a chill and lead to question the intellectual quality of emotion and vice versa as a proverbial Shakespearean drama has the stealth to do. And yes Jim Sturgess was legitimate in ""Across the Universe"", but here we have a star that drags the movies down while everyone else tries to salvage what it may.",1216944000,44,5981,4.771235521235521

Unfortunately, the plot fails on numerous levels; the most blatant being its lack of skill in retelling an old tale from a new and upbeat perspective.  The lame stereotypical characters under-whelm, leaving as the only vaguely intriguing scenes those where main character Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) masters the card counting strategy and eases through its first on-site beta testing. Enter the `duh' factor as the relatively easy scope of the technique as scantily explained and the excellence of each team member's brainpower simply does not gel and the film breaks down into a routine display of pretty twenty year olds wearing expensive clothing, surrounded by Vegas materialism that advances the theme of consumerism above everything else.  Obviously, more is not more in this moral fable.  Professor Rosa (Kevin Spacey) could have recruited a group of community college dropouts for this stint rather than wasting the time and wits of America's finest.  And none of them needed to be attractive--indeed, I would say the more nondescript the better.

Personally, I don't see what all the hoopla over Kate Bosworth is about anyway.  As the object of all of Superman's desires in `Superman Returns,' I had to wonder whether or not after all his cinematic reincarnations, the man-of-steel had finally reached a myopic middle age where his one-time stellar standards had degenerated along with his in-need-of-Lasik vision.  Clearly, Kate Bosworth, as the quintessence of some niche of womanhood that only a frat boy would pedestal-ize, repeats the same performance in ""21"" as a blank-staring Miss Emotionless that hangs around in bars featuring pole dancers (how does that nonchalance suggest anyone's dream woman?) and indulges in the requisite sex scene amidst the lights of the Strip as a backdrop with the same vapidity (not the sex appeal or drive) of the Natasha Henstridge's character hunting for mates in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Species-Blu-ray/dp/B000F9RB9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Species [Blu-ray</a>].

Sadly, my opinion does not alter much with regard to Jim Sturgess, an elfin 20-something Paul McCartney look-alike whose previous appearance as the gender-confused George Boleyn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B0012QE4Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>&nbsp;works far better than his role here as the baby-faced, barely-shaving superior savant who struggles morally with taking a check from his mother for $67K to help pay the $300K bill for Harvard Medical School but has little problem flimflamming as a card shark and lying to fellow geek squad-ers when after multiple all-nighter weekends in Vegas counting cards and winning thousands, he has trouble focusing on their robotically-themed science project.  As in all such cautionary tales whose main characters boast the `great expectations' a la Charles Dickens, we are expected to marvel at the transformation from meek and almost socially insipid shoe-shuffling haberdashery clerk to a Vegas mini-whale wielding designer sunglasses and specially tailored suits.  However, it does not take a glittering neon-infused marquee with the blas needlepoint inscription, ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall,"" nor a GPS system to pinpoint the direction this film heads from the get-go.  Indeed, our MIT Pip gets way too big for his handmade britches, eventually getting caught in the crossfire between the angry Lawrence Fishburne, as a casino security expert about to be downsized by a computerized system and cocky Kevin Spacey as the math professor with a get-rich agenda who masterminds the card-counting scheme.

Faced with a prospect of needing $300,000 to pay for Harvard Med Schol, Ben campbell will go to any means to achieve that.

I laughed out loud in an early scene where student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) impresses professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) by answering a probability question about a car and two goats behind three doors.  Apparently the screenwriter and the director don't realize he got the answer exactly wrong.
I'm all in favor of poetic license to make an entertainment film more interesting.  And nobody takes very seriously a film or book claim of ""based on a true story"".

Rule changes and casino procedures now in place to thwart all the but the very best counters, make doing the same now difficult unless one wants to play forty or fifty hours a week with about a $300,000 bannkroll. This movie, although riddled with procedural BS, manages to catch some of the spirit and excitement of card counting. Several casinos, primarily in downtown Vegas, had no problem taking counters behind closed doors and roughing them up. Check out 21 history on [...] if you have the time to do so.

It's a new story line than other casino movies I've seen (although there may be many other card counting movies I just haven't heard of) and takes a different view on the casino 'heist'.

If you watch movies simply for entertainment then it's a great movie. If you need to watch a movie that's %100 based on reality in order to enjoy it, Hollywood isn't where you should be looking for movies, stick to the Discovery channel.",1215734400,4,568,4.514563106796117

3131095,5,B0014E29TQ,"The following is quoted directly from the MIT website concerning the release of ""21"":

""The movie ""21"" , a fictional work loosely based on the story of the MIT blackjack team...""

""Their story became Ben Mezrich's book ""Bringing Down the House"", which is served as the basis for the fictional ""21.""

So what's with the quotes?  Audiences, as well as directors know that if you put a History channel documentary on the big screen, nobody will want to go see it.  So as a warning, this movie is loosely based on a book that was written about a true story and was spiced up a bit for entertainment purposes.

A group of MIT students led by Ben (Jim Sturgess) and their teacher Mickey Ross (Kevin Spacey) go to Vegas every weekend to count cards and come away with thousands of dollars in profit.  After several successful weekends, their card counting plot is no longer unnoticed.  Overly thorough casino security guard Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) vows to put an end to their card counting days.

""21"" is a highly entertaining film.  Spacey and Fishburne are nothing short of exceptional.  Just keep in mind that this is loosely based on a true story, so what you are getting from this film did not exactly happen in that fashion.  Instead, watch it for entertainment.  So, hit or stay.  I'd choose to stay, because with this movie, you've got blackjack.",1215475200,5,1358,4.6991525423728815
3131096,3,B0014E29TQ,"I've read most of the reviews of this movie I have also seen.  Yes it is certainly very predictable for something based on the true story.  My life isn't as predictable as this was and I doubt most other people's lives are less predictable too.  What you reviewers might think, I THINK the negative remarks should be aimed soley at the director.  The actors afterall, no matter how talented, have too choices, follow direction or lose a paycheck and not take the job.

Not every actor can be as choosy as Jodie Foster, etc.  Maybe her financial situation is different, maybe like many other actors Spacey and Fishburne just like making movies and the money that goes with it?  I'm a musician by trade and if I took that approach in my line of work, I wouldn't play for anyone except the walls of my house which I would have for very long without the money I would not make by being so choosy.  Kinda like the majority of us out here in the real world, right?

I certainly agree this could have been much better in many ways, but for what it is, it was entertaining enough to take me away from the reality of day to day life.  For me, that is good enough not to bash a movie or it's actors.",1215129600,2,1189,4.267857142857143
3131097,3,B0014E29TQ,"If you've read the book 'Bringing down the house', you'll have no doubt set out to watch the movie with great eagerness because Ben Mezrich's novel made for some highly entertaining reading.

And that's where the disapointment kicks in. As most people know, films made from books are never quite the same, mainly due to movies having a limited amount of time to tell a story.

In the book, all the main characters are asian. But Columbia Pictures felt the movie wouldn't sell so well if they didn't have some well known faces to market the film. Their first mistake. Secondly, the book takes place in Vegas, Chicago and the deep south but the film only takes place in Vegas. Why? Also, the character that Kevin Spacey plays is totally different to his namesake in the book. If you ask me, the film has more in common with Ben Mezrich's book 'Breaking Vegas' than to 'Bringing down the house'.

'21' isn't a bad film. It did entertain me, so i guess you could say 'job done'. But the film seemed to take forever to get going. The main character Jim, played by english actor Jim Sturgess seems to spend an eternity deciding whether he wants in or not to the card counting scam. And given that the movie is only a couple of hours long, the filmmakers should have edited the film a lot more sharply and had the MIT team at Vegas within 20 minutes, allowing more room for scope to tell other storylines.

Which brings me on to Kate Bosworth. Attractive, yes. But a good actress? The more movies she makes, the worse she gets! In Rules of Attraction and Wonderland, she was fantastic. In Blue Crush, acting wasn't really required because it was the cinematography of the surfing that was the selling point of that film, plus girls in bikinis. But in Superman Returns, she was the worst thing in it. Lois  Lane cold and heartless? Nope, just terrible acting. She can act, but she needs roles that really push her to her limits. And '21' required her to do little more than pout. I'm sure she was only cast in the movie because of her colloboration with Kevin Spacey in 'Beyond the sea'.

Overall, not a terrible movie but it should have been better than it was. Kevin was a huge fan of the book so it makes sense for him to be in the film for it to get made.

If you want something light and frothy, check it out. But if you want something with a little bit of substance, then you certainly won't find it here.",1215129600,,2403,4.410835214446952
3131098,4,B0014E29TQ,"This movie started off slow but then started to get more and more interesting.

We begin with young, barely-21 Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) - he's brilliant, can do complex math in his head, and has just been accepted early decision to Harvard Law pending his graduation from MIT. Too bad there's a huge roadblock standing in his way - the $300,000 tuition that he can't afford to pay. He's working a tiny corner clothing store making 8 dollars an hour, and apparently his albeit impressive resume is not enough to grab him a full ride.

Then he makes a mark on one of his professors (Kevin Spacey) and gets invited to join an elite club - one that can make over a hundred grand in a weekend by counting cards in Vegas.

The scheme seems foolproof until they attract the attention of a paranoid, crafty casino guard (Laurence Fishburne) who is just looking for an excuse to beat them up and run them out of town.

This movie becomes compelling and it's definitely an interesting idea based on a true story of a group of MIT students counting cards in Vegas.",1214265600,5,1056,4.513089005235602

This film isn't as entertaining as Ocean's Eleven, but Vegas is always a fun place to visit. 21 is a smart film that is more about character development and voice-over narration than the heist itself. Although this isn't the most compelling film of the genre, it is still a lot of fun and, in the end, isn't that why we all go to the movies?",1212710400,2,410,4.407894736842105

3131101,3,B0014E29TQ,"21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.

The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movie seems bent on helping casino security Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.

In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.

Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.

In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.

In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is  an MIT prof and a professional gambler.

The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and his four fellow orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.

Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.

In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense.  In reality, Ma is an oriental, not the WASP portrayed by Campbell in the movie.  It was key to the Groups plan that each week the players like Ma would masquerade as a different Oriental High Roller not recognizable as the high roller he had played in the same casino on another occasion. Ma'd have been caught on the second visit without a different disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip Ma to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.

The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller.

Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.

Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was market designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.

The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity.",1208044800,,5516,4.695652173913044
3365222,3,B0014E29TQ,"I knew going in that the reviews were decent at best, but I had some time to kill and so I gave 21 a shot. The acting was okay and the film wasn't as boring as I thought it was going to be, but the script could really have used some more work. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad (an R rating could have helped make it more believable). There just really wasn't that much to the movie. I feel that Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne were good, but they seemed to be waiting for something in the script worth the talent they both have. Not an overall waste, but I would wait for the DVD and save a few bucks.",1207958400,,608,3.9918032786885247

A book recommended to me time and time again by some friends of mine who like to gamble.  I never got around to reading it but the idea of counting cards to outsmart and exploit some of the greatest of all exploiters certainly interests the old corporation-hating punk still lurking deep in my soul.  So when some of those same friends wanted to see this movie, I reluctantly went along.  I say reluctantly because I'm tired of these clich twenty-something party movies with the primary goal of looking 'cool' first and foremost.  Not to mention, at this point I'm actually tired of seeing Kevin Spacey reprise his role as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lester-Burnham/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lester Burnham</a>&nbsp;again and again.  Another once great actor descending to one-dimensional self-parody.  Anyway, sometimes I walk into a movie thinking it will suck and I'm pleasantly surprised that it only sucks a little, and other times I walk into a movie thinking it will suck and it still sucks.  A day later and 21 still sucks.

To go over briefly, this is a fictionalized adaptation of the card counting scheme put together by a real-life MIT blackjack ""team"".  When I say fictionalized, I think it is to the point where the story was merely inspired by this group, as enough liberties are taken that the film becomes a Hollywood clich-ridden formulaic blockbuster.  And I really mean that in the worst way possible.  All fictional elements added are clichs; from the twists and casino thugs to the shallow and extremely unlikely characters and events.  Spacey is made to be a fool and Fishburne does his very best De Niro.  Both actors are clearly not interested in anything but going through the motions.  Kate Bosworth is a monotonous mannequin and the very talented young British actor Jim Sturgess (great in last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Across-the-Universe/dp/B000ZLFALS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Across the Universe</a>) works hard but unlike Fishburne and Spacey he is probably too young to realize that his performance means nothing. Overall so much acting talent wasting their time here, slumming it in Hollywood's over-stylized shallow end.  Still, the first half of the film focused enough on the actual scheme that it worked a little bit, and from what I hear the first half was consistent with the book (other than the cast being mostly white people while the real-life MIT students were mostly Asian, why is that anyway?).  I wanted to understand more about the game they exploited and I really wanted to root for them as they take these casinos for a ride, but in the end the film turns into a weak heist film with unlikely and unbelievable twists.

The thing that perplexes me most is the money this film is making.  I even heard applause from the nearly full theater after the movie ended.  Young Australian director Robert Luketic (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legally-Blonde/dp/B00005O5CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legally Blonde</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Win-a-Date-with-Tad-Hamilton/dp/0060730056/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!</a>) has style, I will give him that.  He understands what a mass audience wants and he gives them the fancy zooms and quick edits along with the loud and trendy soundtrack.  He gives them the pretty people and the cheap twists.  He makes people money and for that he isn't going anywhere for a long time, that's for sure.  I think I've seen too many films not to find this trite and worn out but maybe you haven't.  If that's the case then give it a look but otherwise this is definitely not recommended.",1207699200,10,4012,5.793867120954004

In Vegas, Cole Williams (Fishburne), the head of security of one of the casinos is about to figure out the team's scheme.  Ben may be in for more than he bargained for.

""21"" is the fictionalized account of college kids who really did beat one of the most sophisticated anti-crime systems in Las Vegas.  The story is interesting, even if it has been Hollywoodized.  The plot points toward the end are predictable, but the fact that these kids were able to get away with this for so long sustains the interest for the majority of the movie.  Kevin Spacey is good as always, radiating intenseness.  Sturgess and Bosworth get the job done, while not providing memorable performances.

3365225,3,B0014E29TQ,"The mistaken presumption behind this film is that fiction is more compelling than the truth, a flaw that haunts so many well-intentioned ""biopics"" and ""based-on-a-true-story"" shams. The real-life Dr. John Nash, for instance, is such a more complex human being than the bland composite of stereotypes Ron Howard served up in ""Beautiful Mind."" The film ""Coach Carter""--and perhaps ""Blow""--are the only ""true story"" flicks in recent memory that didn't grope for a fairytale ribbon to wrap reality in--the magical team ends up losing in the first round in ""Coach Carter"" (in the movie as they did in real life), and ""Blow"" dares to leave audiences unappeased as we watch poor Johnny Depp pursue his greed all the way to a life sentence in prison and permanent dissociation from his beloved daughter.

Here, though, we have a contorted plot so deeply implausible it's almost condescending. There was no crooked professor's guiding hand in Ben Mezrich's life luring him into a foreign terrain of adventure, no Bobby Knight halftime tirades in a Bellagio suite between hands, and that is exactly the thing that makes Mr. Mezrich's story, and the book upon which the film is based, so much more interesting. Furthermore, the real MIT wiz-kids began by failing--miserably, repeatedly, and hugely. Not until the fourth or fifth incarnation of the band of wiz-kids from Cambridge did the money actually start to come in.

Once again, a film with potential misses a golden opportunity at great story-telling--why not expose the MIT Team for the flawed novices they were, confronted and humbled by their own disastrous arrogance before they mustered the determination, courage and skill to overcome great adversity and rake in the dough? Curiously, the real-life ending is actually happier than the one we get in ""21,"" an opportunity that seems to have eluded the director. Instead we're spoon-fed a formula-fiction fantasy passed off as fact that oddly turns out to be monumentally less entertaining than the real story.

First off, Ben Campbell, the main character, is off the charts brilliant, but with hundreds of thousands of dollars in Vegas winnings he hides them in his...dorm room.  Are you kidding me??  I wouldn't have left my favorite CD's in my dorm room.  Kevin Spacey's character clearly quit gambling for a reason...and Ben barely schmoozes him at all, and convinces him to get back in.

3365229,2,B0014E29TQ,"There are so many misfires in the plot of ""21,"" you'd think the filmmakers would be too embarrassed to advertise it as being inspired by a true story. I didn't believe this movie for one second, and this is only partly because it tells such an implausible tale--anyone gifted with the ability to count cards would never involve themselves in a scheme this obvious, and they certainly wouldn't be stupid enough to repeatedly go to the same two or three casinos. And yet five students and a teacher from MIT do exactly that every weekend in Las Vegas playing Blackjack, a game that can easily be won, mathematically speaking. I know little about Ben Mezrich's book ""Bringing Down the House,"" and I know even less about Blackjack; all I can say is that, even if there was an MIT team that won millions by counting cards, I seriously doubt the characters in this film accurately represent the real-life members.

Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an MIT student hoping to be accepted into Harvard Medical. But he has two problems: (1) tuition and boarding alone would cost around $300,000, an amount his managerial job at an upscale clothing store would not provide; (2) despite his excellent grades, a scholarship cannot be guaranteed. He soon meets math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), who immediately picks up on Ben's superior intelligence. Almost immediately, Ben is lured into joining a secret Blackjack club led by Mickey and teamed with four other math geniuses: Jill (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira), and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). Because they're all able to count cards, they know they can beat any casino and walk away with bundles of money. Besides, it's not as if card counting is illegal. Ben reluctantly agrees to join the club, making it clear that he's only doing it to pay for his stay at Harvard.

After training him thoroughly, Ben, Mickey, and the team begin a weekend-only regiment of flying to Vegas with fake IDs and winning lots of money. Here's something I don't understand, and I mean this of both the film characters and the real life MIT Blackjack team: Why would students from Massachusetts travel all the way to Vegas when Atlantic City is much easier to get to? Never mind--let's just focus on the film. Once in the casino, the team uses a very precise system of hand signals and code words: coupling your hands behind your back means the table is hot; touching the corner of your eye means, ""We need to talk""; running your fingers through your hair is a signal to get out as fast as you can. Even words are used: ""sweet"" means that the cards are at plus sixteen; ""eggs"" means that they're at plus twelve; and so on and so forth. Every game scene actually makes the entire scheme look more obvious than clever. Even math geniuses would know to stir up the routine by employing different hand signals each and every time.

Incidentally, I've been calling these characters ""math geniuses"" only because the film tells us that that's what they are. Had we not been given this information, it would be hard to tell--the actors, while capable, never once made me believe they were any more academically well off than the average Joe. Not even Oscar winner Kevin Spacey could convince me, probably because I could focus on nothing other than how unlikable his character is; Mickey uses these students for his own financial gain, and this is for doing nothing besides ""managing"" the team. Eventually, the thrill of winning goes to Ben's head, making him unable to stop even after reaching his $300,000 goal. But as Mickey explained early on, they're in it to count, not to gamble. Ben doesn't care. At a certain point, he doesn't feel he needs Mickey anymore (for reasons I won't reveal). The rest of the team cautiously goes along with Ben, knowing that card counting is a very high-stakes game.

And this brings me to Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), a menacing casino enforcer who will gladly beat card counters in dark rooms. Maybe he's cranky because he's just about out of a job; a new image detection system is quickly making him obsolete. Or maybe he doesn't understand the uncanny ability to watch the MIT team via surveillance when they supposedly stay in different hotels each time. I certainly didn't understand it; maybe I missed something along the way. Whatever the case, Williams is on to them soon enough, meaning that Ben has to find some other way to count cards if he wants the money he feels he deserves.

This is the kind of plot that sounds a lot better than it actually is. But ""21"" works in much the same way a casino does: it blindsides you with bright lights and loud noises, ultimately leaving you poorer than when you first entered. I didn't buy any of it, not the circumstances, not the developing relationship between Ben and Jill, not the relationship between Ben and his MIT friends Miles (Josh Gad) and Cam (Sam Golzari), who are nothing more than nerdy stereotypes. I certainly didn't buy the ending, and while I can't describe it in detail, I can say that it's so implausible and silly it's a wonder no one forced the filmmakers to re-shoot it. True story or not, ""21"" is a film no one can buy into, and that's a shame because the idea behind it is actually very interesting. Card counting is a calculated system, yet the film miscalculates from start to finish. Go figure.",1206662400,15,5354,4.715811965811966

3365278,2,B0014E29TQ,"This was a poorly written and boring movie. The characters are so broadly defined and we are never given any reason to feel empathy for them. In addition, there are so many moments where the characters are just acting foolishly or behaving in ways that are completely counter to the rules they've set up or the things that the voiceover said they were going to do -- like ""we always wear disguises"" and then they are never shown wearing any disguises until the final scene. It's trying really hard to be a clever heist movie, but lacks any cleverness. Instead of seeing the characters as smart folks who are taking advantage of their brains to beat the system and build lives for themselves, they come across as bratty, naive, and dumb with no chemistry. The only reason to watch is if you live in Boston and want to see the city represented (as itself instead of a stand-in for other cities, which is rare these days) on the big screen, although even then you'll be scratching your head over how the map and locations in the film make any sense based on the reality of the city.  ;-)",1472256000,,1084,4.474747474747475

I saw this movie a long long time ago with a priate version and now that I bought the bluray, I watched with the marvelous sight and sound.
It was a pure dream to me.
First of all the picture and sound was so perfect that I almost felt like I was in the middle of the most best theater in the world.

The movie is about this MIT student that has no money and yes he is very bright.
He meets this professor who runs this card game team gambling in Las Vegas earning millions of dollars every weekend.
They make a dream team.
The guy need to go to Harvard and needs scholarship and ticket which is a essay that is so unique that it should be so shocking to convince the professors in the Harvard to make him hell yeah you should be in our school all right.

Seeing him so bright Kevin Spacey the professor asks him Jim Sturgess (Edward Norton look actor) to join their dream team.
They hell earn money all right at the beginning.
But at one time, Jim messed it up by not counting the cards. He took risk and loose about 200,000$ in the spot.
Being really pissed, the professor took everything away from him.
The money that he is saving about 300,000$ and the ticket to Harvard and even the position from MIT as a student.
Now he got nothing, I mean nothing.
All he got is the girl he ment at the team which is a dream of his life.
Now what he should do is a revenge and take back his lost soul.
But he has other plans and there was a secret suggestion before.
Sounds interesting?
Watch this movie for chirst sake.
It's a great film that earned around $$82,000,000 only from the Us without any star casting unknown director.",1469232000,,1745,4.175074183976261

The student/teacher combo is so intelligent that the crux of the plot is watching them be such geniuses that their use of math helps them beat a game of numbers. That is an impressive story, especially considering that this is true. The possibility that this could be a fascinating story is high. It is really interesting, but as another reviewer nailed it on the head, this story was a little too slick and superficial to be great.

This film really should have zeroed in on the human aspect of this story. If the tone had convinced me that this was a true story, and it had seemed really touching and human, it could have been really good. Instead, it played pretty much as a teen movie that was all about adrenaline and excitement. It had the predictable moral that they were moving too fast to survive forever. It took the familiar arc of most teen movies that things were too flashy to last and ""not all that glitters is gold."" It also featured Kevin Spacey acting a little too much like the sinister bad guy with devious motives. He was a little too easy to hate, and you could see what his just ending would be.

In any event, if this movie had been grittier, more realistic, and more human and personal, the way Fincher and Sorkin reached us in ""The Social Network,"" and the way that Van Sant, and Damon/Affleck reached us in ""Good Will Hunting,"" this could have been a pretty great movie. All good movies are human tragedies at the end of the day, perhaps with redemption at the end, but this came off as a slick and shallow teen movie that took a true story and actually made it feel like plastic fiction. It was too cliched and trite. The best of movies take fake stories and make them seem real, but it is sad to say that this one went in the opposite direction. It is also somewhat tainted by melodrama. I think I would have replaced just about all of the actors in this movie, as none of them seemed to be able to dig deep and give the movie that gritty realism it needed. What pulls this in the up direction is that it is indeed exciting and the original premise does catch your interest. Without hating the movie, I give it 2.5 stars. Don't hate me, baby.",1442880000,,2423,4.3822222222222225

3365367,4,B0014E29TQ,"21 is a heist film that stars Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Bosworth, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts, and Aaron Yoo. The film is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team as told in Bringing Down the House, the best-selling book by Ben Mezrich. The film was about the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. It was directed by Robert Luketic.

Ben Campbell may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader who is an eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits.

The film is definitely a fictionalization of a true story. The viewer get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas. This makes it for glossy and lightweight fun. Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius.",1433548800,,1675,4.713310580204778

3365369,4,B0014E29TQ,"Life experience versus book knowledge is at the heart of ""21"", which is apparently based on a true story. This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat fantastical film centers on a mathematics genius who climbs out of the womb of academia and into the fast lane of Sin City, via everyone's favorite Vegas game, Black Jack. Ben at first seems an unlikely candidate. At MIT, he has an IQ measured in light years, but he has about as much street smarts as Mister Rogers. Seems the last time he was outside of Boston was during a previous life. He hangs out with two similar like-geniuses who get A's in chemistry and physics and F's in sociability and charisma. They giggle at the local pub but have no idea how to approach any girls.

But one of his professors, a conniving mathematics professor with ulterior motives, played with sly intelligence by the incomparable Kevin Spacey, detects the computer-in-tennis-shoes in one his classes. Spacey signs him on to an underground group of Black Jack players that make money for themselves and their mentor on weekends. And they return to Boston to their ""normal"" lives of students and professor. Much of the film flip-flops between the glitz of Vegas and the snow-clad streets of Boston, similar to Rounders where the poker playing world and the law school world are contrasted.

Ben learns not only the subtleties of the game but also how to use his computer mind to discern when to bet high and when to lay low. The other members of the team act as scouts to determine which tables are ripe for action and those to be avoided. They wear disguises and use assumed names. The only thing that was a little hard to swallow was that when Ben gets to the table, he can't seem to lose. No matter how good a player may be at determining what cards have yet to be played, they don't always turn up the way you want. I might have wanted him to lose a little bit to differentiate when he won he big.

Like Rounders, Ben is flying high. He is winning hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and the team, and particularly Kevin Spacey. Until a savvy spotter (Laurence Fishburne) starts to see Ben a few times too many. And see him win one times to many. How this plays out is the best part of the film, with a good twist towards the end.

Some have complained that the movie is predictable, but I found it a breath of fresh air when compared with most of the Hollywood sub-par Vegas fair being offered today. ""21"" is far better than the likes of the ridiculously silly movie ""Lucky You"". ""21"" is well-written, mostly believable, and with an outstanding performance by Jim Sturgess who carries the whole film much like Matt Damon in Rounders. Sure, maybe it follows the typical W form of story-telling a little too closely, but I was never bored and I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. Overall a winning hand, I mean film.",1432771200,,2860,4.558365758754864

 21 is the story, based on true events, of some smart kids from MIT who take on Las Vegas.  The collegians are card counters.  Card counters can vastly increase their odds of winning at black jack, also called 21.  Card counters are the reason that casinos now use many decks at their tables.  Though perfectly legal, card counters are discouraged from playing, these days, at any casino in the world.  The kids are doing something dangerous, exciting and very lucrative.  It is hard not root for them against the cold blooded casino bosses.
 The lively young cast is led by Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth (Blue Crush).  They are supported by Laurence Fishburne as the casino heavy who comes down on them like the wrath of God.  This is foreshadowed early on in the film when Sturgess is shown strapped to a chair while Fishburne beats the tar out of him.  We know something bad is going to happen to the kids but we pull for them anyway.
 Kevin Spacey is the MIT professor who guides and mentors the kids, while taking advantage of their talent.  Spacey cant produce a poor performance.  He is genial and terrifying as the roll demands.
 This film was budgeted at $35 million and has already gathered $97 million world wide.  The people have spoken and they like this movie.  Chip in your dollars and see this four saw blade film.",1412380800,,1335,4.561181434599156

3365419,3,B0014E29TQ,"21 is about the journey of a poor, genius MIT student, Ben Campbell, who aspires to go to Harvard. His only problem is the college tuition. Although his SAT scores and 4.0 GPA are impressive, it's not enough to get him the Robinson Scholarship which would pay for all of his schooling expenses. Though he is eligible the recruiter tells him that he needs to have something special, some life experience, that sets him apart from everyone else that wants the scholarship.
This experience practically falls into his lap when his college professor, Micky Rosa (played by Kevin Spacey) invites him to enjoy his ""club"" of students who spend every weekend in Las Vegas gambling, and making a lot of money. Ben agrees to join but only until he makes enough money to pay for Harvard.
Even after he has made the money for tuition, Ben continues to gamble. However he starts getting full of himself and greedy and breaks the rules of the deal. After losing thousands of dollars Micky kicks him out of the club as well as takes all of the money that Ben had been saving for college.
What the club is doing, counting cards, isn't exactly legal and they end up with the security of the casinos after them. Ben makes a deal with the chief of the security Cole Williams, who has had it out for Micky Rosa for a long time, in order to get himself out of the mess and get everything he lost back.
The movie ends well with the last scene is of Ben telling the recruiter about his experience. The recruiter is scene to be astonished and the audience can surmise that Ben got the scholarship.
Kevin Spacey did well to play the part of the sly can conniving professor Mickey Rosa. he is also known for his parts as Hopper in The Bug's Life, Lex Luthor in Superman Returns, and Dave Harken in Horrible Bosses.
The plot line itself is interesting but they could have done more to make the movie better. For one thing, they hardly develop the other characters. You know little about even the main character, Jill, any of the other club members, or Micky Rosa. You're given a few glimpses here and there but nothing really substantial.
There's a little bit of romance between Jill and Ben but overall, not much romance. The only action occurs when Cole Williams is beating people up so not much action either. The movie does have some incredible scenes of the highlights of Las Vegas and does well to capture the energy of it all.

Acting

Overview

An effort was made here and there that just did not pay off, yet there were several wonderful long shots that really did shine. When the movie starts there is a scene that is taken from the end of the film to create a surprise of events. When this occurred the film there was no trust that the audience was going to figure out what is happening. Backtracking events and then slowly spoon feeding the audience step by step what is plainly obvious. But the real problem is the execution. It was running at snail speed. Boredom quickly set in and it never really recovered. Then there were incidences that stretch a healthy suspension of disbelief to a breaking point. One occurrence is when the protagonist hides a small fortune of money in an insecure place in his dorm room. A supposed genius would not hide over three hundred thousand dollar is such a manner. I am curious to what amount would he decide to open a bank account.",1406419200,,1148,4.598039215686274

Excellent Jim Sturgess is a mathematical genius whose desire to get into medical school drives him to accept the questionable ethics of college professor Kevin Spacey, who turns similarly gifted young people against the odds of the Los Vegas gaming tables.
  Terrific character development and performances, although Spacey chews up too much scenery and twirls his figurative mustache a bit too much for my taste.  Sturgess' character arc is well-developed and believable, while he maintains sympathy throughout.  Good wins in the end, but the road there is pretty rough.  Likewise the casino thugs' aggression and violence are a bit hard to take; can you really have the tar beaten out of you for winning through card-counting without legal ramifications?  Scary.

I'm not a numbers person and I find the idea of using mathematics to beat the house fascinating.  It's not something that I'd EVER be able to do and I think it's interesting when people can go all 'Rain Man' and make oodles of money.

The basic plot of the movie is exactly what I just said.  A bunch of MIT grads, under the guidance of their professor (played by the wonderful Kevin Spacey) learn how to apply their math skills to blackjack.  They go to Vegas and win big.  Of couse, along the way, they have life lessons and learn important things about themselves and what's truly important in life (cue the violins in the background).

In case you're not aware, this is based on a true story, though some creative liberties have been taken with the plot.  In the end, the film is still worth watching.  Jim Sturgess is Ben Campbell, an MIT math nerd looking to go to Harvard Medical School but lacking the funds to do so.  He gets a sense of hope when his professor, played by Kevin Spacey, invites him to join a covert team of equally intelligent students who travel to Las Vegas.  According to Prof. Spacey and the team, they don't gamble...they count cards to ensure their success and subsequent profit.  Intrigued, Campbell signs up.  He is then predictably sucked in by the perks of his new life, including the hot girl who suddenly takes an interest in him.  However, this predictibility does not dampen the film but perhaps instead drives it forward as we watch Campbell's character slowly devolve until he's outright in an out-of-control downward spiral.  Again, it's a film  that takes many liberties with the events it's based on (there's a contraversy surrounding casting) but it's still worth a watch or two...or more.

3365447,3,B0014E29TQ,"Everybody and their brother (and sister too) knows by now that the current student debt crisis in America is out of hand. Kids trying to get a serious higher education that might keep them off the streets, off the public dole, and gainfully employed in someplace other than bottom- feeder Wal-mart or Mickey D's are practically becoming indentured servants to the banks and other lending agencies in order to get out from under such a fate. Over the long haul we really are going to have to promote, as a matter of public policy, of social survival policy, a program of free quality higher education for all who want to go that route. Of course that proposition today is pie-in-the-sky and is a question for the future. So what is a kid, a hard- working grind of a kid, totally committed to getting him or herself a higher education to do in the meantime ? Well, one possible solution is presented by the film under review, 21.

And that is the solution not  just the title of the movie. Basically go to Vegas (or I suppose Atlantic City or some other such gambling venue) and play 21. Simple, simply work out a system of counting cards and presto you are rich, rich enough anyway to grab that higher education. In the film it is a nerdy guy, an MIT grind, who through hard work and,well, grind has been accepted in Harvard Medical School  in order to pursue his dream of being a doctor. But he has no dough , no $300,000 price tag dough, and so it looks like no go for our young hero. Except a fairy godfather (really an MIT professor)  shows our student the way forward through working as a team with four other ""best and brightest"" to grab lots of dough ""under the radar"" with the professor's system. A system he had worked out and perfected from the days when he was a card-counter, now retired, in the old days.

Oh yeah, there is one little problem.  No, not the problem that one might get addicted to beating the odds and go overboard, begin to like the ""life"" while having tons of fun being comped and everything in Vegas (including a little fling with one of the female team members).That 's nothing. No, the problem is that those casinos in the desert (or anywhere ),well, frown on card-counters. And they are more than willing to do something about it whether you are some weary old professor or a young MIT grind. Watch the film to see what the ""they"" (led by Lawrence Fishburne) are willing to do about the problem. As for non-elite college students, non-grinds, non-math memory whizzes, or the merely timid. perhaps you should think about fighting for that social policy of  free quality higher education mentioned above.",1379116800,,2635,4.546413502109704

3365460,2,B0014E29TQ,"Dramatically this movie was okay and time moved pretty quickly while I was watching it.  However because this movie claims to be based on a true story there are 3 points I would like to make.  Point One:  Modern Las Vegas casinos do not muscle professional blackjack players anymore.  They did in the 60s but this is not the 60s.  All of the huge casinos in Las Vegas are owned by giant corporations and that is not their style.  They have a procedure for dealing with card counters and it does not involve touching them.  Occasionally a rogue employee might become hyperactive but if a complaint is filed and investigated that employee is sure to be fired.  Point Two:  Both the movie and the book imply that the reason the real team was successful is that they have MIT brains and can solve differential equations and perform quantum mechanics in microseconds.  This implication is so ridiculous it is laughable.  A card counter does not memorize cards as the urban legend maintains.  He adds and subtracts the high cards from the low cards and then divides by the number of decks remaining to be played.  If the true count (the divided by decks count) is greater than +1 the professional player has a slim advantage.  The advantage is so slim that the professional player (and professional team) will often lose and lose big on their way to long run profitability. The reason for this can be explained by statisticians - it would take too long here.  The professional player knows this but does not need to make difficult calculations to play the game.  The knowledge level of mathematics required to count cards will occur in the average person at about the age of ten.  However to actually win a professional player does have to be quick, determined, heavily bankrolled and tough - willing to play long hours and not give up.  He must be willing to sit for long hours at tables full of smokers, drunken players, bad smelling players and ignorant players making ignorant comments.  He needs to ignore bad headaches and always carry a large supply of Tylenol. Point 3:  The movie and the book imply that the actions of this team are highly original and creative.  They are not.  Virtually the same thing was done more than 50 years ago and has continued to be done right up onto this day.  There is absolutely nothing creative or original about what this team did.  A much better book on the same subject was written by a much better player named Kenny Uston more than 50 years age.  The book is entitled Million Dollar Blackjack.",1371427200,,2533,4.638202247191011

3365466,4,B0014E29TQ,"""21"" is great! This is how the story goes: The true story of the very brightest young minds in the country - and how they took Vegas for millions. Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who -- needing to pay school tuition -- finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school's most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. With unorthodox math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa leading the way, they've cracked the code. By counting cards and employing an intricate system of signals, the team can beat the casinos big time. Seduced by the money, the Vegas lifestyle, and by his smart and sexy teammate, Jill Taylor, Ben begins to push the limits. Though counting cards isn't illegal, the stakes are high, and the challenge becomes not only keeping the numbers straight, but staying one step ahead of the casinos' menacing enforcer: Cole Williams. The cast led by Jim Sturgess (as Ben Campbell), Kate Bosworth (as Jill Taylor), Laurence Fishburne (as Cole Williams), and Kevin Spacey (as Micky Rosa) is great!

3365472,4,B0014E29TQ,"Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an MIT student who finishes top in his classes and is applying for a scholarship after being accepted into Harvard Medical School. We see him being interviewed as he attempts to secure the $300,000 that will enable him to enroll. Unfortunately, he's one of 76 applicants, and his rivals possess credentials similar to his own. In order to win the scholarship, he must write an essay that will dazzle the professor making the final decision.

Ben's life experience is unremarkable. He has a crush on a fellow student who is apparently hopelessly out of his reach, and his friends are geeks. He's serious and doesn't seem to have any fun, such as dating or socializing. What could he possibly write about?

That all changes when he impresses one of his professors, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), during a lecture. He's invited to become part of a team coached privately by Micky, but this has nothing to do with school. Micky teaches him how to count cards, and explains that the system is certain to beat the odds if it is correctly applied. They plan to go to Las Vegas and win enormous amounts of money. While that sounds unlikely, Micky insists that it's not gambling at all. After a visit from Jill (Kate Bosworth), at the store in which he earns $8 an hour, Ben eventually decides to join the team.

I'm sure that some of you are rolling your eyes. Can a system really beat the Vegas odds? Well, this story is based on true events, and the method of counting cards is surprisingly simple.

The title refers to both the best Blackjack hand, and the fact that Ben is about to become a 21-year-old. We see him learn how to keep the count. It begins at zero, and a point is added for cards between 2 and 5, while a point is subtracted if the dealer turns over a 10, Jack, Queen, King, or an Ace. Cards falling between 7 and 9 have no effect on the count.

The team consists of five students. Three sit at random tables to monitor the count. When the count is high, the odds favor the player over the house. The person then uses a prearranged signal and one of the remaining team members sits at the table and places large bets. A series of codewords is used to tell the high stakes player exactly what the count is. For example, ""sweet"" would mean that the count is +16, and highly favorable. The high stakes player then keeps track of the count and must have the discipline to quit when the odds are no longer favorable.

Sounds simple enough, right?

A large part of the movie is devoted to the action that takes place in Vegas. It's a glamorous lifestyle, completely different to Ben's Boston existence. If the movie works for you, you'll probably imagine yourself in that situation. The prospect of winning large amounts of money with very little risk is appealing. The risk portrayed in the movie comes in the form of casino security employee, Cole Williams (Fishburne). He's fully aware of the systems used by card-counters, as he used to do it himself. Although it's not illegal to count cards, casinos have the right to prevent people from playing at their tables. Williams has more violent methods than simply barring someone from playing, so he's the main villain in the story.

I wouldn't claim that 21 is original or unpredictable. You can probably guess some of the things that happen to Ben over the course of two hours. But, like many predictable stories, it's worth experiencing for the way in which it is told. If you are a fan of the main actors, find the thought of winning money appealing, or believe you have the abilities necessary to count cards yourself, you'll be thoroughly entertained. My favorite movie about cards is Rounders, but 21 is a close second.

I could have done without the flashbacks explaining the meaning every time a codeword was used, but that's a minor quibble.",1365292800,,3833,4.592105263157895

3365477,5,B0014E29TQ,"In this drama a relatable college student struggling with finances finds a way out of his debt through high stakes gambling.  But, is it gambling if all the participants are highly trained MIT students more than capable of counting cards?  This group of early twenties college students  were led by their professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) on several precarious trips to Las Vegas where they work in teams at the casino's black jack tables.  Interestingly enough this film is based on true events.  21 relates to the audience through the personality of its characters.  This picture uses unique camera angles and movements matching the chaotic turn of events the film takes as the characters find themselves getting lost in the tempting life style Las Vegas and gambling has to offer.  All these features in addition to the inventive rewriting of a previously done plot added greatly to the success of this film.

The first few scenes show the main character Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) struggling through typical issues of a college student including homework and balancing a part time job.  His mental ability surpasses the average college student, but his mild and modest persona makes him a very relatable character.  Campbell reveals early that he is concerned his cookie cutter life style will keep him from standing out while applying for necessary scholarships.  Perhaps this is why he is so easily convinced to join the group by a fellow member, and love interest Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), who promises him ""a thrill and more money than you could possibly imagine.""

As the gambling trips become more frequent Campbell allows his emotions towards Taylor and his own ego get involved in his decisions.  This turn in the plot is expressed well through innovated camera work.  Director Robert Luketic's slow motion panning shots of casino floors and sky views of pool parties show Campbell falling into the temptation of a dangerous lifestyle.  Quick shots and faded transitions of the team partying in night clubs and strip bars make the chaotic turning point obvious.  Life finally flips for Campbell when his relationship with the group leader, Rosa, crumbles.  He is left with the decision whether he should pick his life back up and start from scratch or continue down the dangerous road of gambling.

This colorful film shines a new light on the true events of the MIT team that mastered the art of counting cards.  Although the details of the plot and script were invented for entertainment purposes, the premise that above average college students gave casinos a run for their money remains true. The audience is brought deep into the personal lives of the main characters Campbell, Taylor and Rosa so much so that they will feel the rush of the player's successes as well as the risks and failures that each will experience.  This finally presents the question of how far would a student go to pay for their tuition?",1361145600,,2935,4.951020408163266

3365482,4,B0014E29TQ,"Whether or not the movie is closely tied to a book or not, card counting did happen and maybe still does. What's not to like? Friendships are broken and reestablished, there's some payback, there's forbidden romance, there's underhanded treatment(casino) for doing a very legal thing[mob tactics], there are upstarts, there're lessons learned that are applicable to life, and there are 2 villians in the movie.

Even card counting the premise is an easy concept to grasp--even if you can't do it good enough to do it like a pro. The ending is the best ending I've seen since Enemy of the State. These people did a great job with everything; almost everything made sense; they didn't have to bend or break rules to make certain parts of the movie work. Give them credit where it is do; don't be fuddy duddies and complaining ultraconservatives.

The concept is real(there are documentaries out on it), Spacey and Fishburne were as good as ever, the lead actor plays a good turncoat wielded by ego; power; money; and fame, and the characters go very well together. The only thing is they occassionally delve into concepts that are too advanced for many without associate degrees in business, math, or the sciences to have any idea about what they are talking about(let alone, understanding them), but you don't have to and there is so much going on to counter this; it happens 2 or 3 times in a long movie.

Don't listen to what everyone is saying; they are clueless; I own the DVD; watch and pay attention the first time you watch and watch again and do the same thing; there's just too much going on to ensure that you'll get it all on one pass. Make sure you pay close attention the first couple of times that you watch, bc there are a few trippable places--if you don't pay attention.

Negatives: 1. They ""hob-knob"" in the same casinos time after time even though Mickey(Spacey) knew the dangers of card counting; (regardless of whether he lacks concern for them or not--that info cannot be known), Mickey loses(potentially) a lot of money if they get caught. So, that part just did not make sense. No wise businessman takes a significant financial loss against the business without justifying it--when all he has to do is buy a few players' bus/hotel fares as insurance(travelling to Atlantic City, NJ from MIT has to be 1/3 of the Las Vegas commute--maybe even less when you consider buses) to other casinos in another state to minimize this risk. Jump around as if robbing banks. Mississippi is an idea(probably not as sophisticated as Vegas has to be; plus, fares are cheaper, too). Why not switch locales or ,at least, make reference(in the movie) to venues in another city to show the audience that you went there?

2. At the end, they allude to a new group of card counters that encapsulates new(Ben's school friends) and the old members, but how do they accomplish this with the facial recognition software that was already implemented? They used it to recognize a disguised Ben earlier in one of their last trips.",1357862400,,3024,4.741444866920152

The movie begins with a display of cards. It is legal to count cards, but casinos will eject and ban anyone who they suspect is doing this! They want losers as customers. There is a view of Boston and a bridge over the Charles River. Ben really needs money for school. His part-time job as Asst. Manager pays $8 an hour. He celebrates his birthday with his friends. A class discusses Newton's theory and choosing a prize on a game show. One student invites Ben to a meeting about blackjack (one of the most popular card games in the world). There is a scheme to ""beat the system"". Ben is asked to join as he is good with numbers. The girl invites him to Las Vegas. The team practices at card counting in ""21"". Do casinos use extra-legal means to discourage this?

The team practices their schemes and signaling for when the deck is ""hot"" and when to scram. Ben visits an illegal gambling den for his inititation. They pass through the TSA search. We see Las Vegas from the air. [Those fancy buildings were paid for by the losses of customers.] Do those flashing lights have a physiological effect on customers? They use false identification and are warned about their behavior. Ben begins to win. [They make it look easy!] Their work is reviewed by Mickey. The players in a casino are under constant watch. Back home Ben talks to his Mom. He visits a bar with his friend and meets a girl. He spends weekends in Las Vegas, and is watched. Ben hides his money in his room, he cannot use a bank or a safety deposit box. [Does he report his winnings to the IRS?] There is an argument and another player pulls a pistol! [Is this kept out of the news?] They must cash in their chips fast! One of their team is discharged.

Ben makes an ""honest mistake"" about a 16K microchip. Is his mind on his work? ""I guess its not my night."" He didn't follow his instructions, he has to pay back his losses. Can they operate on their own? Ben likes this life. [But will Mickey drop a dime?] The casino watchmen talk about ""biometrics"". They threaten to kill Ben! Back in Boston Ben gets bad news in a letter. His stash of cash was stolen. [Are those teachers in cahoots?] Ben talks to his teacher. Can he get back in? There is another big win. They grab their chips and flee the casino watchmen. Ben was caught, Cole makes a deal with him. ""Leave the bag!"" Later Mickey meets Cole again. Back in Boston Ben asks another professor if his story ""jumps off the page""? [The rest of the story is left to your imagination.]

Parts of this story were fictionalized for dramatization. Read the better book ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. This could have been a better story, its like something is missing or out-of-sync. Was it the writer, director, or producer? It serves as a warning against the idea of winning money at gambling. The odds are against it, but a few will win because many more lose. Gambling casinos are profitable only so long as they have a monopoly and there are enough customers with money to lose. Money spent on gambling reduces spending for other businesses in the area. Its like a big business located outside of town that drains wealth away from the area.

Counting is a mental activity unless you make noise or use some kind of device to keep track of memory or use some other tricks beyond pure mental activity. Playing games is a mental activity. And people believe this kind of myth that one is not allowed think while playing mind games. Don't you think that winning blackjack requires some kind of smartness? Or just anyone can win without any thinking?
It is true that the Casinos can kick anyone out of their Casinos without giving any reason. If some smart kids win them huge moneys and keep winning, they have to kick them out. But counting is not the reason.
I am tired that people will accept this Hollywood myth as truth.
Here are some quote from the internet:
---In Nevada, the courts have made it clear that card counting is legal. During a cheating case in 1983, which involved a player who was crimping cards to gain an advantage (definitely cheating), the court made an interesting statement: ""By way of contrast, a card counter -- one who uses a point system to keep track of the cards that have been played -- does not alter any of the basic features of the game. He merely uses his mental skills to take advantage of the same information that is available to all players."" As I. Nelson Rose, author of the book Gambling and the Law*, states -- ""The card counter is playing by the rules of the games, as set up by the casino regulators and the casinos themselves.""  ---[...]",1297555200,,1460,4.53030303030303

Kevin Spacey's character in the book was much more fleshed out than in the movie.  At the end, the character is made almost comic with the chase scene through the casino. I felt that this portrayal of the MIT professor in the film betrayed the true nature of the real life man.

I suppose some manipulation of the romance between Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth was to be expected.  And the concoction of the Harvard Medical scholarship review was not really necessary, but strictly a Hollywood ploy.

A rather impoverished student at MIT decides to accept a proposal to make some easy money, since he is good at numbers, by playing Black Jack in Las Vegas. That student will get the scholarship he needs to go to Harvard medical school that costs 300,000 US dollars. He is dragged into the black jack business by some math teacher who is using a group of students to make easy money (he gets 50% of the winnings) without being seen because he is persona non grata at all and forever in Las Vegas, though they do not know his face. That professor is of course a crook and when one night, unsettled by some riff raff with his best friends, our student, Ben, loses a lot, the professor destroys everything: he blocks him at MIT, he visits his room and steals his money that was hidden in the false ceiling, ruining at the same time his dream of Harvard, he even tells the security people that the student is back at the black jack table. But the student gets his revenge on the professor, the hard way, but he had to deal with the security boss in the casino who cheats him in his turn and he is still without any money left. But that really dazzles the Dean of Harvard Medical School who interviews him a second time: he went to Las Vegas 17 times, won the 300,000 dollars twice and they were stolen from him twice too. Apparently that is a dazzling life experience that deserves a scholarship. That film is immoral, wicked, perverted, and that student is going to be a doctor. I just hope he does not gamble with the life of his patients the same way. And yet it is fascinating because it demonstrates some people are ready to do absolutely anything to satisfy their desires, to reach their goals, to succeed, no matter what it may be. At the same time some are ready to betray anyone to get even or get revenge or just to get a profit out of these others. But are you sure you would not do that too? You can't imagine what some very decent people were able and ready to do in Nazi concentration camps just to be a Kapo, which meant they had a chance to survive longer. In some situation you cannot know what you would do. Anyway, to defeat casinos on their own ground is absolutely funny for us the spectators and must be absolutely funny for the ""gambler"" even if he has to be good with figures, which means slightly autistic, which means slightly retarded.

But I darn sure like a rowdy tale about counting cards and beating Vegas, which is why I so enjoyed 21, a fun trip of a flick about a group of M.I.T. students--led by a most unscrupulous math professor--wreaking havoc at the Vegas casinos.

The story centers around math whiz Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), a nondescript nobody with aspirations of getting accepted into Harvard Medical School.  When his mathematical prowess is discovered by the fiery professor named Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey is such a hoot) Ben's invited to join a special handful of students being trained to count cards and win some serious coin at the blackjack table.  Ben is hesitant at first, as he doesn't appreciate the moral/ethical tinge of it, but once he scores his first 21 he's like a shark smelling blood in the water.  Thus the good times roll, as the card counting team goes to class at stuffy old M.I.T. during the week, then spends weekends in Vegas winning bags of money, staying in penthouse suites, and clubbing 'til the cows come home.  Ben starts to feel invulnerable--which is exactly when the floor drops out from under him, Rosa turns on him, and he incurs the wrath of a very revenge-minded casino security boss (Laurence Fishburne).

The pacing and plot get up and go once the characters begin gaming, and it's grand entertainment to watch all the negative consequences once the fudge hits the fan.  Sturgess is fine, as is romantic interest Kate Bosworth, yet the true fun is watching Spacey and Fishburne gobble up every scene they're in.

So off to Vegas they go to put their system into play.  But can a clean-cut, wholesome boy like Ben stay true to his goals and principles once he`s had a taste of life in the fast lane?

Based on a true story, ""21,"" directed by Robert Luketic, is a slick, superficial, well-oiled crowd-pleaser that holds one's attention while it's playing itself out but doesn't provide much food for thought or emotional resonance after it`s over.  Jim Sturgess makes for an appealing protagonist as the acceptance-craving Ben, but the real acting here is done by  Kevin Spacey as the odious professor who uses blackmail and bribery to keep his minions in line, and  Laurence Fishburne as a head of casino security who may turn out to be the one serious impediment to the team`s success.  The script fails to make the card-game esoterica comprehensible for the lay audience - we're forced to accept way too much of it on faith - but hardcore gamblers will probably be taking notes for future pointers.

Plus, there's a great moment at the end that makes the whole shebang suddenly worthwhile.",1265414400,,1912,4.56140350877193

3365517,2,B0014E29TQ,"A fact-based drama ""21"" should have been much more engaging than it is. There is potential for more thought-provoking drama or more intelligent thriller, but somehow the filmmakers failed to notice that, making the whole story very superficial. ""21"" tries to satisfy all the viewers with its ""neat"" ending. It shouldn't have. It has ruined one of the most interesting real-life stories I've ever heard.

The story is this: ""Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions"" by Ben Mezrich"" upon which the film is based. I was intrigued by the story (the book title says it all), which seemed so interesting. However, the film was a huge disappointment.

While the script of ""21"" starts promisingly enough, with a struggling MIT student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who is recruited to join a team of gifted students, the film soon loses grip and disintegrates into a preachy, humorless melodrama. Kevin Spacey appears as a charismatic MIT professor organizing the team of students, who fly to Las Vegas and make money using the ""card counting"" skills. His slightly mysterious character interests us at first, but soon slips back into a predictable role in a typically Hollywood fashion.

So what went wrong? It is the script. Somewhere in the process of translating the book into a screenplay, something is gone. Perhaps it is moral ambivalence. Perhaps smart thriller. What we got instead is romance, which only slows down the pace, and clichd narrative devices that are so obvious and clearly out of place in this fascinating real-life story. I've never been to Las Vegas, but I don't think the casino securities would treat the guests - even though they are ""card counters"" - in the way Laurence Fishburne's character does.

3365519,3,B0014E29TQ,"21 stars Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Jim Sturgiss, and Laurence Fishburne. The movie is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who, with the help of one of their professors, trained themselves to count cards and win big in Vegas.

Ben Campbell (Sturgiss) is brilliant but broke. A star student at MIT, he's worried about how he (and his single mom) will pay for medical school in a year. He's working a job at a men's clothing store, but it doesn't begin to put a dent in what his tuition will cost.

One of his teachers, Mickey Rosa (Spacey), notices Ben's uncanny ability with figures. Mickey invites Ben to join his select group of Vegas card-counters, and then the story starts to cook. Jill Taylor (Bosworth) is also part of the group, providing a love interest for our young protagonist, and pretty soon, the students and their wayward professor are living high on the hog in Sin City.

But complications ensue, as they always do. A run-in with Cole Williams (Fishburne), a member of the Vegas security set, lines up the characters for a tricky ending.

I liked this movie. It moved along quickly, the characters were relatable and likable, and Kevin Spacey makes everything that much better. Plus, the story is a good one. What broke college student wouldn't want to use their natural talents to beat the house? Shoot, if I could balance my checkbook without making a subtraction error, I might try it myself!

In addition, the first sample presented in the movie of his mathematical prowess was that he knew how to break 100% up into 3 parts...which made his professor take a second look at his paper...at MIT no less...which is even more unconvincing than the acting.

3365528,3,B0014E29TQ,"The story of how several MIT students were able to beat Vegas at their own game is compelling and entertaining. Unfortunately, it's told in a book titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Down-the-House/dp/1417665637/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Down the House</a>&nbsp;not this movie. While based on the factual account of extremely bright card counters who devised a system capable of generating a very favorable win ratio in Black Jack, 21 delivers very little of that true story. Instead, it focuses on sensationalizing elements of the story and dramatically over simplifying others. It provides a glamorous but empty portrayal of characters who in real life were very interesting and intelligent.

Card counting, as represented in this movie, hardly requires anything more than an average IQ and the ability to count quickly, not the gifted mind of a top MIT student. Frankly, this has been simplified so that the viewer is able to grasp the key concepts; not a bad idea in itself since not everyone is a gifted mathematician, but they've gone too far and left the viewer wondering what, if anything, makes the protagonist Ben Campbell or any of his cohorts special. As portrayed in 21, it seems that anyone could practice counting cards in their basements for several months and then go make unlimited amounts of money in Vegas. There are ways to make material accessible to the audience without over simplifying it to the level of silliness.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase/dp/B00008UALL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase</a>&nbsp;is a good example of how to do this tastefully.

Over simplification is not the only issue in 21. Other elements have been made glamorous where unnecessary, sometimes with a level of implausibility that is laughable. The worst of these would require providing spoilers, but there are a few worth mentioning. First, these wildly intelligent card counters, led by a street-smart proffer played by a well cast Kevin Spacey, are always frequenting night clubs, sleeping in luxury casino penthouses, and in general drawing massive amounts of attention to themselves, all while purportedly trying to stay under the radar of the Casinos and their eye-in-the-sky security experts. This is ridiculous. Not even Lawrence Fishburn's entirely convincing and frightening portrayal of an old-school casino security chief can save this movie from dreary implausibility. Second, the interplay between the students are based on silly cliche. These same 'brilliant' students cannot seem to remember their own basic set of rules, or even follow basic Black Jack strategy when they are either fatigued, angry, etc... That is a blatant, undercutting reversal of what is supposed to make them who they are: an icy ability to calculate odds and stick to a system.

Spacey and Fishburn make the movie less of an ordeal, but they're not enough to save this one from itself. Some of the dialogue is pretty interesting, especially the interplay between the protagonist Ben and his cut-throat professor. The psychological underpinnings of the relationships between Ben, the professor, and the former premier card counter whom Ben has supplanted could have been a dramatic gold mine, but these interactions are left on the sidelines in a movie more concerned about driving the plot forward than telling a great story.

Overall, 21 is worth watching simply because its the next closest thing to the excellent book on which it is based. This is a rent not a buy. 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 because of Spacey and Fishburn.",1229904000,3,3653,5.529516994633274

Plot: This guy needs $300k for Harvard Medical School. He has an $8/hour job. Spacey's character is a teacher who invites him to count cards at blackjack and go to Vegas to win some cash. The students use hand signals to say whether a table is hot or cold (one of the hand signals is really obvious it almost looks like a baseball play).

3365531,3,B0014E29TQ,"Maths and card-playing do not seem to be subjects to light up the screen with energy, but the director here has a fair stab at doing just that.
`Inspired' by a true story, an epithet which presumably allows them great license with the facts, we follow the seemingly nerdy but brilliant Ben Campbell.  He is an MIT student desperate to get funds for his Harvard aspirations, and falls in with a group of students who win large amounts of money by `card-counting' at Blackjack in Vegas, led by their maths professor (Kevin Spacey).  We see his gradual corruption as the girls, money and high rolling lifestyle lure him to push himself further.  And then of course, things start to unravel.  Unfortunately, the story does not explore the moral murkiness of the events very far, and still manages to drag things out just a little longer than it might have.  Still, the pace is peppy, the direction as energetic as the subject can let it be, showing an improvement on the director's previous fare `Mother-in-Law' and `Win a date with Ted Hamilton', and has a decent soundtrack to keep momentum up.
The cast all perform acceptably, with Kevin Spacey hardly stretching himself but still successfully filling out an important part.  Kate Bosworth looks stunning no matter which disguise she is wearing, and Jim Sturgess as Ben makes the transition from nave nerdy wannabe to cocky highroller and finally to `wiser-than-his-years' young man.
All told, a young sexy cast, veteran actor for gravitas, and a soupcon of moral ambiguity make for an entertaining and worthwhile couple of hours, but falls short of being inherently memorable.  (6/10)",1228780800,,1634,4.9416058394160585
3365532,3,B0014E29TQ,"In the long running tradition of films that lack substance yet make up for it in fun, `21' works quite well, delivering a thrill ride movie experience that is entertaining and engaging even if it is nothing we haven't already seen a hundred times before.  With palatable performances and a decent flow of action, `21' tries very hard to reach its target audience (rebellious teenagers) and in that regard it hits the nail on the head.  If you are looking for a more intelligent look at this true story then you may be let down, since this movie is purely superficial and exists only to rake in the money.

The film tells the story of math genius Ben Campbell who's dreams of getting into college ride on the chance to snag a scholarship, a scholarship that he deserves but most likely won't receive.  His mother has saved up all her money to give him for tuition, but he doesn't want to take her savings (he's a saint of sorts).  That's when he gets a proposition, to join a secret team of similar math geniuses who train to count cards and then let loose in Vegas under the watchful eye of their professor Micky Rosa.

So the film is really little more than a small group of good looking teens gambling and drinking and partying.

Like I said; money maker.

I really felt that `21' would have a little more substance, beings that the story is so engaging, but they totally went the sell out route with this one, making it nothing more than a random collage of everything you would find in a teen movie.  That isn't to say it isn't entertaining, because it is, but it's the type of pointless entertainment you can find almost anywhere.  They try and play the whole morality card, but even that attempt is halfhearted and feels a little dead.

The performances are actually pretty good, especially from the older actors in the film.  Kevin Spacey is pitch-perfect as the `hidden agenda ridden' professor Rosa, and Laurence Fishburne (who I tend to find stiff) is flawless as the hard edged security man trying to hunt down the casino's heavy hitters.  The group of youngsters is pretty decent, standouts being Sturgess and Yoo.  I usually really like Bosworth (I adored her breakout performance in `Blue Crush') but here she is stale to me.

This is not your typical biopic; it's your typical teen Blockbuster.  Watch it for the sheer entertainment value but don't expect to really care too much.  There is a slew of much better, far richer Blockbuster fare released this very year.

3365536,3,B0014E29TQ,"I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.

There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.

Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an ""8"" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.

Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up ""card counters"" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.

The movie captures the excitement of the team counting cards in Vegas, but the characters are unbelievable. Kevin Spacey plays a vindictive professor who organizes the team.

Sturgess plays a very smart student trying to make some money because he was accepted into Havard Med. School. The timeline is very confusing. Is the whole story a flashback? However, I thought the essay is what kicked the plot off. The love story is not very convincing or interesting. Also, these Vegas trips were business trips for these students. According to the accounts I read, they did not regularly go to strip clubs. They went on overnight trips. They did not have time to for all the partying in the movie.

The aspects of the movie I liked best was how they showed the signaling and card counting working. The gambling was done well. The scenes of college life were good.

3365542,1,B0014E29TQ,"This movie's fatal flaw is that it never addresses the obvious solutions to any of the myriad problems it poses.  The question in my review title is hypothetical; I realize that if the main character had gotten a student loan for medical school, the plot wouldn't have been possible.  However, the movie asks us to suspend disbelief far too many times, and in completely unrealistic ways.  The idea of student loans is never even MENTIONED and we're supposed to believe that a smart MIT student like the one played by Jim Sturgess has no other way of paying for Harvard Med.  If that's the case, how the hell did he pay for an expensive school like MIT in the first place?  We're also supposed to believe that these smart people who KNOW they're being watched are intelligent enough to put on fake-looking mustaches and wigs (Though not the ethnic kids; I guess if you're not white it's assumed that no one could possibly remember your face anyhow.) but not to change their totally obvious hand signals.  Then there's the part where we're supposed to believe that their otherwise cool and collected leader would change his mind about gambling just in time for a key plot twist strictly on the basis of a sixty second conversation.  Oh and of course everything wraps itself up in a neat little bow.

In a way I'm biased, because I knew I would hate this movie from the moment it began.  Sturgess is a likable enough actor, but his narration never worked for me.  Throughout the movie he keeps repeating the phrase ""Winner, winner chicken dinner"" -- and even though he explains it, it makes about as much sense as any of the other plot holes in this crappy movie.

I don't care how big of a Kevin Spacey fan you used to be.  There is no reason on earth to see this movie.  Everything from the ending to the ""twist"" to the soundtrack is 100% predictable, and you (obviously) don't have to be an MIT student to figure it out.",1223769600,7,1921,4.517341040462428

However, 21 focuses more on the main character using his skills of counting cards as part of what he needs to do to make money to go to medical school.  Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey turn out great performances here.  However, the younger supporting cast including JIm Sturgess steals the show.  You don't have to be a Poker love to love 21.

One element I liked about the movie is the Vegas scenes they showed off.  The suites, strip view, casinos, clubs looked beautiful on HD.",1222214400,,285,4.775510204081633
3365550,5,B0014E29TQ,"This is a great film with very interesting card play.  I enjoyed learning the code words that were used in the card games.  I felt this aspect brought me, the viewer, into the movie - almost as a participant.

Great audio and video on the Blu-Ray.",1221782400,,247,4.326086956521739
3365551,4,B0014E29TQ,"The world of Vegas often has the tendencies to become highly stylized once it is put to film and of course the town itself can walk the walk and talk the talk.  But it is up to the writer(s) and director whether or not the story will have the preverbial stones to be paired up with the ""City of Sin"". And fortuneatly for the team that has brought us 21, they seemed to know when to hit the gas on the glitz and glamour that is the Vegas lifestyle, but also knew when to pull the throttle back when it was time to bring the viewer and the players back to reality. The formula for the film is quite simple and a story is one that could be recognized quite quickly if one had heard or read the book Bringing Down the House.  Certaintly details had been modified to fit the rags to riches three act structure, but the song and dance remains nearly identical.

Ben(Jim Sturgess), portrays the painfully shy MIT senior that is scrambling for a way to afford Harvard Medical School after he graduates.  His near minimum wage job isn't cutting it, but his grades and standout performances in class do so enough to catch the attention of his cunning statistics professor(Kevin Spacey).  Soon Ben is offered a spot on a team of MIT students led by the Professor Spacey who spend their weekends counting cards in Las Vegas and walking home with enough money to pay the average four-year student loan.  Ben reluctantly accepts the position as a ""means to an end"" to pay his way through medical school.  Of course, business starts off well, but soon after Ben becomes subject to the lifestyle that Sin City has to offer and begins to lose track of his home life.  And with an ""eye in the sky""( played by an indimidating Laurence Fishbourne) onto the team's scheme, Ben's world quickly falls apart as quickly as the house of cards it was built upon.  The standard formula of loose ends are tied up by the end but that should not deter the viewer from becoming wrapped up in the life of Ben and his cohorts.

The supporting cast play their parts respectively, however furthering some character quirks may of been able to take some of the load off of newcomer Sturgess. But these few flaws are not nearly enough to take away the fun and excitement that  21 was able to provide for me, and easily left me longing for a trip to the Strip for some ""heavy action"". And for that reason alone, the film should hit it's mark for the popcorn-loving viewer.",1221091200,,2432,4.430493273542601
3365552,2,B0014E29TQ,"Aweful film! Bad acting and even worse story. To think a group of higly educated college students could play as a team weekend after weekend and not be discovered right away is insulting. Vegas is way too advanced to get conned like this.

All the major plot lines are there,  nerd likes hot girl, needy guy needs money for med school, do gooder teacher is actually a villan.  The problem is that nothing really gets explored.  Its like the director does not know if he wants to hit or stay and ends up playing with little risk.  The movie flows and the ending was not entirely expected.  If you are on the fence about buying this movie ask yourself are you risk taker than go ahead and buy if you stay on a 15 than you should walk away.",1220745600,,543,4.0754716981132075
3365554,3,B0014E29TQ,"I always enjoy gambling movies including the classic ones like ""Cincinnati Kid"". Although ""21"" is reasonably entertaining there aren't any stand out performances including from the experienced Stacey or Fishburne. This is a rental unless you have a heavy interest in this  take on the six M.I.T. students that counted cards and won millions of dollars from the Vegas casinos. Although certainly worth a look I didn't feel surprised or impressed by anything in the movie. It just seemed like mostly a rehash of ""Oceans Eleven"" with college students.

I didn't believe the poor reviews at first and so I rented it...I wish I had listened.

The story is narrated by our main character throughout the film and it is horrible to listen to for both content and the annoyance of his voice.

They really Hollywooded up the plot, with all the predictable twists and happy-ending everything-is-ok-in-the-end and we-have-learned-our-lesson bull-s...There was just nothing at all that stood out about this movie.  They could have replaced BlackJack with any other activity, like skydiving, tennis, or working at a McDonalds and they could have reused much of the script and the plot lines.

3365560,1,B0014E29TQ,"Intelligent film viewers beware:

Apparently, Ben Mezrich's fantastic, non-fictional account of beating the house -- for real -- in the mid-nineties was not good enough for the makers of this film.

For some incomprehensible reason, they took a fascinating real-life story, glammed it up, time-shifted it to the present day, packed it full of tired cliches and overused plot devices, and baked up what we have here -- a totally unbelievable, totally silly exercise in film frustration.

Even good actors cannot save a terrible script.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?  This could have been so smart, so good, just like the freaking book...

And by the way, the classroom exercise early in the film about a gameshow host and opening the doors makes absolutely no sense to me or my wife.  Knowing what's behind the third door does not help you decide which of the two remaining doors is preferred.  After door three is opened, the original choice of door number one becomes no more or less likely to win than door number two.

GET THE BOOK, it's great and might make you smarter.  This movie will just make you dumber.",1219276800,5,1111,4.8

The actors are great.  Kevin Spacey is a great actor and he proves it again in this movie.  The rest of the cast is great too.

The Blu-Ray looks great on a 1080p HDTV.  Perhaps I just had Vegas fever from just being there but the scenes of the Strip and of the hotels make me feel like i'm right back in Vegas.

Ben ignores the obvious foreshadowing and joins Team Vegas, a gang of weekend card sharks with seductive double lives. At least until he loses his mentor's money and Spacey turns his charm into a threat.

Without giving away too much, let me just say, if you enjoy the rush of the fast life, and you also enjoyed the book ""Bringing Down the House"", give this movie a go.",1219104000,,668,4.605042016806722

3365565,4,B0014E29TQ,"Okay, I have not read the book this was based on, so I don't know how accurate it is.  Still, it is a compelling story of the attraction of a lot of money, an ambitious and needy student, a conniving professor, and what happens when you compromise on integrity in the quest to get rich fast.

Kevin Spacey gives a fine performance as the professor in question, who sucks in a group of gifted students in his scheme to make gazillions of dollars in Vegas via card counting at 21.  Jim Sturgess, the newest team member, turns out to be the smartest but also the most desperate, and it becomes clear that excitement, alcohol, and complacency can wear down even the most serious card-counters.

I would have liked seeing some crawls at the end explaining what really happened to these students, their professor, and the casino ""eyes"" who kept an eye on the action and the perpetrators.  Unfortunately, we are left to wonder about their true fate.  Also, who the heck would hide huge stacks of money under a loose ceiling panel in a dorm room?

Went to the ""other"" school in Cambridge having realized the MIT experience was completely detached from the real world.  I am familiar with some of the members of the card-counting team.  They had a pack not to talk about their losses, for good reasons.  The casinos found their income at the poker tables increased about 10 times, after the ""rumor"" was spread that MIT students won money from them.  Of course, the casinos did not bother to refute their claims.

What type of people run casinos?  Certainly not stupid or charitable people.  It is a complete fantasy to think some book-smart kids can take money from street-smart operators at their home court.

The only things that would have made it more enjoyable for me would have been a longer love scene and more details about their shopping and other indulgences.

In real life, the MIT Blackjack Team devised a complex scheme of card-counting, disguises, and hand signals to win four million dollars in Vegas before the heavy hand of casino security gave them the boot. This film follows that outline, but it's a pale imitation of a genuinely interesting tale of greed, intellect, and emotion. Kevin Spacey stars as the MIT professor Micky Rosa who bullies, badgers, and betrays his six students in venial Vegas. The dialogue is horrible and at points entirely predictable. There's no character development. The sub-plots about friendship and parents hold little interest. The plot does take some unexpected twists, but even this resolves in a cheesy ending.

The thing that bothered me the most was Jill's hair!  Why did they give this attractive character such a bad hairdo?  Not only was the color bad, the cut was not flattering at all.

Oh it is bad. Please note that this piece of refuse is rated PG-13. I can't help but think that any movie about Las vegas should receive a default rating of R. Heck, you can't even walk down the strip without being handed an X-rated card inviting you to buy some female company for the evening.

I got suckered by the fact that Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne are in the movie. Don't be fooled. And shame on the both of them, as they are vastly more capable actors than the pathetic performances they contribute to 21.

The lead is played by Jim Sturgess, who impressed me in Across The Universe, but here I could hear his English accent bleed out with every other word. Kate Bosworth, who starred in Superman Returns with Spacey, plays the love interest, but just didn't seem all that interesting.

In fact, the only thing interesting was how they got away with it, because the code-words, hand signals, and disguises seemed so transparent the film's ending should have happened when they first got off the plane!

3365578,3,B0014E29TQ,"Based on the novel ""Bringing Down the House"", ""21"" is about five M.I.T students who, along with their teacher (who is ringleader), concoct a plan to count cards, forming a secret ""study"" group where they practice their skills and signals before heading to the big stage of Las Vegas. Ben first rejects, and then ultimately accepts the invitation to join, for the reason of getting enough money to get to med school. Ben, who wows his instructor (Kevin Spacey) with his knowledge of numbers and probability, quickly becomes the leader for the group, but once in Vegas, becomes seduced by the glamour, thrill and rush it brings. He becomes a polar opposite person from his mundane, nerdy existence in Boston, where his two friends begin to suspect that something has changed him. Ben forgets advice given to him by his instructor of not giving into his emotions, that their plan is not to gamble, but to count. Predictably, Ben falls for one of the girls in his study group (Jill), betrays his friends, and becomes reckless; all the while the eye in the sky (Laurence Fishborne) is watching his group on surveillance. Without giving too much away, the focus shifts to what will happen if and when the group gets caught, will Ben save his friendship, and will he be able to save enough for med school.

While the story is interesting, plot logic and obvious and blatant embellishment of the M.I.T story (which it is based on) gets so far-fetched that the movie may be rendered partial fantasy. For one, why did the group decide to go to the same casino every time, with the same head of security (Fishborne) watching him from above? Being that Las Vegas has at least twenty casinos, you would think these whiz kids would catch on to that. Also, I was a bit perplexed by Fishborne's character ""roughing up"" guys who he suspected were counting, as if he were some mafia boss. As far as I know, counting cards is frowned upon, and you might get asked to leave, but not illegal, and security certainly wouldn't come barreling out of their office full force and tackle suspecting counters, taking them up to their office to beat up. (If I'm wrong, enlighten me). Another criticism is the overacting. Not only does Fishborne's character borders on lunacy, but Kevin Spacey's does also, being way over the top as well, spewing out instructions and threats to anyone turning their backs on him, or failing to carry out his plan. The ending was a bit logic-defying as well, only dreamed up in a screenplay, not in real life. It seems to me that if the writers/directors would have done a little more homework on this subject, the movie might have been spared some walloping by critics.

All in all, it was a mixed bag. The idea of teams going to Vegas to try to beat the system is an engaging one, and the psychology and thrill of the game is what kept my interest. If you are too much of realist, you might be a little disappointed. Normally logic in film is my pet peeve, but I was able to set it aside just because I found the subject fascinating, and despite several flaws, it was a fun film that was well-paced and held my attention. It's also the kind of flick that will get people talking after they see it, which is usually a good thing.

Don't listen to the bad reviews here. Wow, so many of them. Apparently they are out to pick movies apart and point out all the minor flaws.

""21"" is based off the book, ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. Yes, it is a true story. No, the movie obviously doesnt follow the book exactly. They want to make money like everyone else. The movie is all ""hollywood"" with cons, set ups, snappy lines and hot chicks! Yes, alot of the movie is made up, who cares, its a movie and a good one.

I've read the first 100 pages of ""Bringing Down the House"", its similar to the movie, but not as much fun. In the book, the teacher and most if not all the students are Asian! The book couldn't keep my attention, but the movie is alot of fun.

Dont pass up ""21"" based on the bad reviews, Kevin Spacey is great, Laurence Fishburne is well Laurence Fishburne and Jim Sturgess is excellent!",1217116800,5,899,4.239766081871345
3365581,4,B0014E29TQ,"Films about gambling and Las Vegas in particular have always held a certain fascination with the public, culminating with perhaps the ultimate Vegas movie OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But this week we have a release of a film that takes the Vegas movie a whole new direction. Most stunning of all is that it is in part based on a true story.

TWENTY ONE is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), a struggling student at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) who has hopes of attending Harvard Med School. A grade A student with a 4.0 average, Ben is interviewed for a full ride scholarship. All he has to do is present an essay describing a life experience that sets him out above the other several hundred students applying. The problem is he has nearly no life experience.

That all changes when he starts a class taught by Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). During the class, Rosa notices Ben's aptitude with numbers and mathematical equations. In turn, he invites him to join a select group of students Rosa has put together. The reason? Using the technique of counting cards, they plan to make a mint in Vegas at the blackjack tables.

At first hesitant to do so, Ben finally comes around and joins the group which consists of Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). The group learns to not only count cards, they put together a set of signals to let the lead player know which tables are hot and when to move on. When they have it down, they become Vegas bound.

It runs like clockwork. The tables return them all a tidy profit and back to school they go, only to return weekend after weekend. Along the way a romance develops between Ben and Jill, Choi continues to pilfer tiny items everywhere he goes and Fisher places the entire project in jeopardy with a drunken night at the tables. The result is Fisher gets booted and Ben becomes the big cheese.

With money coming in like never before, the rush of taking on the tables in Vegas and finding love at last, Ben's life changes but not for the better. Grades become a thing of the past as do his friends. His focus becomes making more and more money until he takes a chance he can't come back from.

A bad night at the tables results in Micky cutting Ben lose and leaving the team in their hotel room alone. Making the decision to go it alone, Ben gets caught by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), the head of security for the hotel casino. Not only does he get caught, Cole has a grudge against an old gambler he lost years ago...named Micky Rosa.

The twists and turns at the end of the film along with the build up from the start make this a compelling movie that holds your attention from the starting gate. Ben's life riding a roller coaster of lows, highs and a return to the lows makes for an interesting tale that turned out much better than I expected.

All performances seen in this flick are totally believable from the leads to the secondary characters. While Spacey may have been the ""name above the title"" in getting this movie made, he doesn't take center stage here, instead opting to work with the ensemble and that is to the benefit of the film.

Based on the true story of a group of MIT students who actually did take Vegas for a ton of money, though not nearly in the same way shown here for dramatic effect, the film is certain to get the hopes up of gamblers seeking a way to beat the bank. Don't get caught up in that notion as the house is always the favorite. Instead, get caught up in the tale of a group of students led by a charismatic teacher who take a gamble and end up getting more than they bargained for.",1217030400,25,3648,4.449101796407185
3365582,1,B0014E29TQ,"Evidently, MIT teaches math geniuses to cheat Vegas as follows:
1) Show up with, party with, and sit next to your cheating buddies at every casino every time you show up
2) Never change your signals; use the same ones every week
3) Pick hair styles and clothes to draw attention to yourself.
4) Store your money in the ceiling (evidently MIT seniors have never heard of mutual funds or money markets....or maybe they just don't have those in Massachusetts yet).

Or perhaps the more logical explanation is this:  the screenwriters for this film have absolutely no clue as to what they are doing.  Even Spacey's math lectures were idiotic.  His topics featured concepts typical in an honors high school course, not in a senior MIT course.  He also changed topics every couple of minutes and the new topic had NOTHING to do with the one he was just discussing (Newtons method for approximating roots to difficult non-linear equations led to the three door probability problem...huh?)
And did anybody notice that everything the kids did was actually legal?  The ONLY thing the casinos can do (and this is actually what the real casinos did) is force the kids to leave (with their earnings) and not come back.

And Ive finally come to the conclusion that Spacey can only play one role.  He has played the SAME character in nearly every movie he has done.  And this one has career killer written all over it.",1216944000,3,1403,4.717213114754099
3365583,3,B0014E29TQ,"Many critics have found the movie distressed and compromised by the lack of vitality that should be excited by any movie that has Vegas as its stage. Indeed they do not overdraw from a tale that rehearses the usual rut of a good guy forced by circumstances to use his talents to an immoral strain so as to keep up with the rest of the world. The story is based on the book ""Bringing Down the House"", about the experiences of MIT student Jeff Ma and his team of gambling buddies, yet it deals with situations that both add and detract from the truth and the fiction alike. In the process of translating the narrative as a movie script the story absorbs qualities that feel jaded and ordinary by Hollywood standards, and the sensationalism of the story is depressed by the memory of Ocean's 11 and Casino, movies that have raised the stakes so high 21 flops by comparison. Not to mention the radically simplified version of the ""cheating"" strategy employed by the students, which seems to be so arithmatically feasible that one wonders why it does not happen more often. And by the way it does happen but to say that it is possible is not saying anything beyond the dreamy subtitle of a Vegas trip.

The movie does have numerous redemptive qualities, some of which have been so indiscreetly dealt with by most critics it gives credit to the theatregoers who simply discuss movies for fun and not as a professional happenstance. The movie has a subpolt filthy rich with a wealth of psychology that it is unfortunate the leading role went to Jim Sturgess. The star of the team of brains that ""plays"" the casinos is frightful to watch. This is undoubtedly the worst acting in a leading role in a long time. Emotionally he is a dud; his intelligence never shines through; his panache is invisible; his anxiety mechanical; and his attraction for Jill is melodramatic without the hint of affection and as if it were not enough, his supposed timidity is something we deduce more so by hearsay than by any true acting merit. If reminded of another Boston genius played by Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"" we realize how bad the performance is. And he stands alongside Kevin Spacey, who is in top form as a math professor that recruits the students and schools them on how to take down the house. The wry sarcasm, the coiled irony and the implacable cynicism we have come to admire is delivered with taste as always. He elicits well the emotional farce of a stigmatized, pulverizing, insensitive, crass, demoniacal soulless leader that corrupts and avenges without any notion of a limit ever being entertained. Spacey is fabulous and Laurence Fishburne is far too good for the role dealt him, but as all great actors have time and again reminded us, there is no such thing as a small role. He practically takes over the movie. His struggles and fears, the demons of the past that haunt him and the vengence he craves as a anodyne to a tarrying heartache is impressive. His psychosis is balanced just enough to climax with irresistable loathsomeness, all the while rendered so vitally sympathethic we end up siding with him, to some extent, only to be reminded by the plot that we should not have according to script. And what about Jill? yes the genius gal who is second shafted because of gender by the math prof, she seduces the audience, even Ben (although the acting made us wonder quite a bit). Kate Bosworth emotionally composed performance fits well with the directive of her role. This film reunites her with co-star/director Kevin Spacey and director Robert Luketic. She demonstrates the maturity of an actress scintillatingly beyond the clammy classless fixture of her romantic counterpart. She admonishes Ben on several occassions thereby functioning as a alloy to his instinct and as a monition of conscience, which all american movies must support in some way so as to be rated PG-13, as this one is. Not a scene where she becomes sexy merely by physical disclosure, rather she is sensual because of her aloof poignant approach to rational stirrings. She evades close-ups, she dashes through frames as if by impetus and never loses the momentum claimed from the moment she enters the intricacies of the drama. She deserves a better mate, but the role of Ben is an excessively demanding character to do justice to.

The outstanding quality of the movie resides in its exploration of the reason/emotion dichotomy. The two spheres seem to be mutually-exclusive until we do indeed approach Shakespearean heights that defy any such garbled psychology. We are brought to economize the sentimental pragmatism that is required of such a narrative by tracing the vulnerability that such a distinction isolates. Please watch the movie again, those of you who've failed to illuminate this aspect of a trajectory that takes us card after card unto a universe where rational dictates are full force countermanded by emotional traces, and the two domains clash and clang to a barely audible cacophany that goes beyond the moral lithanies we often impose on the ethics of a movie. Here there is no such thing. We see Lady MacBeth, we see Iago, we see Othello. There have been few movies that have been able to unearth the benumbing force that these separate universes betray. 21 succeeds in this, more so than the book on which it is based. And the performances of Spacey, Fishburne, Bosworth, and not least Jacob Pitts in the role of Fisher make it a flick worth viewing. The last actor in the aforementioned list, Jacob Pitts, sidled into a minor role that is played flawlessly that storms about with thunderous energy.

21 has fertile layers, that if one is willing to explore, will yield a chill and lead to question the intellectual quality of emotion and vice versa as a proverbial Shakespearean drama has the stealth to do. And yes Jim Sturgess was legitimate in ""Across the Universe"", but here we have a star that drags the movies down while everyone else tries to salvage what it may.",1216944000,44,5981,4.771235521235521

Unfortunately, the plot fails on numerous levels; the most blatant being its lack of skill in retelling an old tale from a new and upbeat perspective.  The lame stereotypical characters under-whelm, leaving as the only vaguely intriguing scenes those where main character Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) masters the card counting strategy and eases through its first on-site beta testing. Enter the `duh' factor as the relatively easy scope of the technique as scantily explained and the excellence of each team member's brainpower simply does not gel and the film breaks down into a routine display of pretty twenty year olds wearing expensive clothing, surrounded by Vegas materialism that advances the theme of consumerism above everything else.  Obviously, more is not more in this moral fable.  Professor Rosa (Kevin Spacey) could have recruited a group of community college dropouts for this stint rather than wasting the time and wits of America's finest.  And none of them needed to be attractive--indeed, I would say the more nondescript the better.

Personally, I don't see what all the hoopla over Kate Bosworth is about anyway.  As the object of all of Superman's desires in `Superman Returns,' I had to wonder whether or not after all his cinematic reincarnations, the man-of-steel had finally reached a myopic middle age where his one-time stellar standards had degenerated along with his in-need-of-Lasik vision.  Clearly, Kate Bosworth, as the quintessence of some niche of womanhood that only a frat boy would pedestal-ize, repeats the same performance in ""21"" as a blank-staring Miss Emotionless that hangs around in bars featuring pole dancers (how does that nonchalance suggest anyone's dream woman?) and indulges in the requisite sex scene amidst the lights of the Strip as a backdrop with the same vapidity (not the sex appeal or drive) of the Natasha Henstridge's character hunting for mates in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Species-Blu-ray/dp/B000F9RB9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Species [Blu-ray</a>].

Sadly, my opinion does not alter much with regard to Jim Sturgess, an elfin 20-something Paul McCartney look-alike whose previous appearance as the gender-confused George Boleyn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl/dp/B0012QE4Q2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl</a>&nbsp;works far better than his role here as the baby-faced, barely-shaving superior savant who struggles morally with taking a check from his mother for $67K to help pay the $300K bill for Harvard Medical School but has little problem flimflamming as a card shark and lying to fellow geek squad-ers when after multiple all-nighter weekends in Vegas counting cards and winning thousands, he has trouble focusing on their robotically-themed science project.  As in all such cautionary tales whose main characters boast the `great expectations' a la Charles Dickens, we are expected to marvel at the transformation from meek and almost socially insipid shoe-shuffling haberdashery clerk to a Vegas mini-whale wielding designer sunglasses and specially tailored suits.  However, it does not take a glittering neon-infused marquee with the blas needlepoint inscription, ""The bigger they are, the harder they fall,"" nor a GPS system to pinpoint the direction this film heads from the get-go.  Indeed, our MIT Pip gets way too big for his handmade britches, eventually getting caught in the crossfire between the angry Lawrence Fishburne, as a casino security expert about to be downsized by a computerized system and cocky Kevin Spacey as the math professor with a get-rich agenda who masterminds the card-counting scheme.

""Their story became Ben Mezrich's book ""Bringing Down the House"", which is served as the basis for the fictional ""21.""

So what's with the quotes?  Audiences, as well as directors know that if you put a History channel documentary on the big screen, nobody will want to go see it.  So as a warning, this movie is loosely based on a book that was written about a true story and was spiced up a bit for entertainment purposes.

A group of MIT students led by Ben (Jim Sturgess) and their teacher Mickey Ross (Kevin Spacey) go to Vegas every weekend to count cards and come away with thousands of dollars in profit.  After several successful weekends, their card counting plot is no longer unnoticed.  Overly thorough casino security guard Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) vows to put an end to their card counting days.

The actors afterall, no matter how talented, have too choices, follow direction or lose a paycheck and not take the job.

Not every actor can be as choosy as Jodie Foster, etc.  Maybe her financial situation is different, maybe like many other actors Spacey and Fishburne just like making movies and the money that goes with it?  I'm a musician by trade and if I took that approach in my line of work, I wouldn't play for anyone except the walls of my house which I would have for very long without the money I would not make by being so choosy.

3365594,3,B0014E29TQ,"If you've read the book 'Bringing down the house', you'll have no doubt set out to watch the movie with great eagerness because Ben Mezrich's novel made for some highly entertaining reading.

And that's where the disapointment kicks in. As most people know, films made from books are never quite the same, mainly due to movies having a limited amount of time to tell a story.

In the book, all the main characters are asian. But Columbia Pictures felt the movie wouldn't sell so well if they didn't have some well known faces to market the film. Their first mistake. Secondly, the book takes place in Vegas, Chicago and the deep south but the film only takes place in Vegas. Why? Also, the character that Kevin Spacey plays is totally different to his namesake in the book. If you ask me, the film has more in common with Ben Mezrich's book 'Breaking Vegas' than to 'Bringing down the house'.

'21' isn't a bad film. It did entertain me, so i guess you could say 'job done'. But the film seemed to take forever to get going. The main character Jim, played by english actor Jim Sturgess seems to spend an eternity deciding whether he wants in or not to the card counting scam. And given that the movie is only a couple of hours long, the filmmakers should have edited the film a lot more sharply and had the MIT team at Vegas within 20 minutes, allowing more room for scope to tell other storylines.

Which brings me on to Kate Bosworth. Attractive, yes. But a good actress? The more movies she makes, the worse she gets! In Rules of Attraction and Wonderland, she was fantastic. In Blue Crush, acting wasn't really required because it was the cinematography of the surfing that was the selling point of that film, plus girls in bikinis. But in Superman Returns, she was the worst thing in it. Lois  Lane cold and heartless? Nope, just terrible acting. She can act, but she needs roles that really push her to her limits. And '21' required her to do little more than pout. I'm sure she was only cast in the movie because of her colloboration with Kevin Spacey in 'Beyond the sea'.

Overall, not a terrible movie but it should have been better than it was. Kevin was a huge fan of the book so it makes sense for him to be in the film for it to get made.

Too bad there's a huge roadblock standing in his way - the $300,000 tuition that he can't afford to pay.

3365598,3,B0014E29TQ,"21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.

The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movie seems bent on helping casino security Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.

In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.

Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.

In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.

In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is  an MIT prof and a professional gambler.

The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and his four fellow orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.

Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.

In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense.  In reality, Ma is an oriental, not the WASP portrayed by Campbell in the movie.  It was key to the Groups plan that each week the players like Ma would masquerade as a different Oriental High Roller not recognizable as the high roller he had played in the same casino on another occasion. Ma'd have been caught on the second visit without a different disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip Ma to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.

The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller.

Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.

Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was market designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.

The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity.",1208044800,,5516,4.695652173913044
8255390,3,B0014E29TQ,This is a very good movie.  A group of MIT students led by one of their teacher's who recruits them.  Count cards and go to Las Vegas and come back with millions. But when the students start doing things there own way.  Things start going bad very quickly.  This is a very well done very well acted movie.  It is really intense.  And worth watching over again.,1525219200,,360,4.298507462686567
