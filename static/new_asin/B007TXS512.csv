8521898,2,B007TXS512,"Video quality is great on these but if you haven't see the contest, do NOT watch the extras until you watch the entire program. Disk One with the first part of the semi finals has a spoiler in the extras that gives away the final winner.

Disk TWO is an unknown because my copy did NOT come with a disk two. I returned it and the replacement ALSO did not have disk two. Terrible quality control on these.

Disk three was fine and the contest itself was wonderful. The only reason this copy gets two stars. Otherwise it'd be one star.",1359417600,,533,4.267326732673268
