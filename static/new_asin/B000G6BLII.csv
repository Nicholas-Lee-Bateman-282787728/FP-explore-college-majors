8129015,2,B000G6BLII,"I purchased this in the hope that A Life Less Ordinary would be proper 1.85:1 AR. Wrong. It is 2.35:1 framed in 4:3. Result: You either watch a stretched screen on a screen with black bars on all four side (not utilising your big screen much). So A Life Less Ordinary is this release is the same botched AR as all the other release. You are basically getting 2 movies for $20-25. Not good value in my books.

Give it a miss and buy the individual copies.

If anyone does know of a BR release of A Life Less Ordinary let me know,",1403568000,,528,4.116504854368932
