7997698,3,B0000AN4FM,This disk has a problem.  Episode one will not play from the play it all button. It works otherwise.  It would have been nice if the seller had of told about that problem.  I would have bought it anyway and I would have left 5 stars.,1391299200,,233,4.021739130434782
7997699,5,B0000AN4FM,I love cartoons. But I never thought I'd live to see the day when Rowan Atkinson's character would be made into a cartoon. The animated series of Mr. Bean are just as funny as the live action episodes.  His facial expression in the cartoons really cracks me up. There is this old lady character who doesn't tolerate Mr. Bean's actions one bit.  The way she reacts to the way Mr. Bean acts is very hilarious. Anybody who love to watch cartoons should have this in their home. They may not know what they are missing.,1257033600,,515,4.410526315789474
