It is one of the few films I've seen in my six decades of life which has literally left me - if not a better person for having watched it - than at least a better informed individual.  All this is made possible because the director, Margarethe von Trotta (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Pamela Katz) respects your intelligence enough to not sermonize you but instead present the facts of the case and trust you to deduce the film's true meaning on your own.  What viewer could not be honored by such trust and respect?  It's been nearly forty years since I first read 'Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil' and it was an eye opener then for its clear cut honesty.  But until I saw this film, I had no true sense of the devastating price Hannah Arendt paid for that honesty.  She was sent to Israel to view Adolf Eichmann's trial in calm expectations that as a Jewess she would swallow the propaganda that gentile Eichmann was pure evil of whom no good could be said and the Jews were saintly martyrs of whom no criticism could be made.  Well, Arendt was too smart and too honest to swallow that lie; she knew human nature too well - she knew truth.  And she presented that truth so brilliantly in her book that readers had no option but to reject the Israeli propaganda as much as she did.  But, oh, did Arendt pay a bitter price for her honesty.  Suffice to say that I never understood the depths of her courage until I saw this film.

Everything about this movie is superb.  Barbara Sukowa is priceless as Hannah Arendt, not a step wrong.  Janet McTeer as her loyal friend, Mary McCarthy, gives a performance that is a joy to behold.  Axel Milberg as Hannah's deeply loving but also deeply unfaithful husband is also excellent.  Margarethe von Trotta's faultless direction puts her on the level of Elia Kazan (with his 'Gentleman's Agreement') and William Wellman ('The Ox Bow Incident').  It's heady company but she richly deserves to be there.  Please see this film yourself.  The chance to think in a new way, to see the world and your own suppositions differently, etc., is an opportunity not to be missed.",1500681600,,2223,4.515
