318759,2,6301229371,"Attitudes have changed quite a bit since 1973.  Anyone born after 1980 will have trouble deciphering this film's severely dated sexual politics.  But it is still worth watching, if only for Glenda Jackson's spot-on performance.  She infuses the limp dialogue with brio and charm; she is alternately fiery and vulnerable, and she steals every scene.  Jackson beat out Ellen Burstyn for the Oscar, apparently because the academy was too freaked out by THE EXORCIST to seriously consider it as a contender.  Time has provided the appropriate corrective; this film is virtually forgotten, while THE EXORCIST is still scaring the pants off of people.  Give it a whirl, see what you think.",1269907200,,683,5.108108108108108

318762,5,6301229371,"This is one of my favorite romantic comedies, for several reasons: good writing, fine acting, London in the early 70's, and Glenda Jackson.  It evokes a time which was memorable for those of us who were born and raised during the turbulent 60's. After a decade of such angst, society seemed to regain a bit of self-deprecating humor with the dawn of the 70's. It is precisely that brand of humor that I find appealing in this film. The dialogue is sharp, sophisticated, and has the great good fortune to be delivered by two fine actors; Glenda Jackson being especially deft, tossing out acidly witty, intelligent retorts with withering English stoicism. She is clearly the ""class"" in the film.

The story is a familiar one: divorced woman meets charming married man, they start having an affair and end up falling genuinely in love. The ending is inevitable. But this well-trod material is elevated by the intelligence and humour of both script and performance.

Yes, it is ""dated"" -- the clothes, the coifs, phrases such as, ""He's my male secretary"", the rather pointed portrayal of a gay man -- but for those who like to wallow in nostalgia every once in a while, those things are positives rather than negatives. I highly recommend this movie to fans of Glenda Jackson, London, and witty dialogue.",1194998400,4,1300,4.820627802690583
318763,4,6301229371,George Seagal and Glenda Jackson are wonderful in this comedy about extramarital affairs.  You also get to see a very young Paul Sorvino.,1178409600,,137,4.956521739130435
318764,5,6301229371,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the 70's and have seen it many times on and off for years.
The movie is funny, but what makes it work is the two stars.  George Segal (who never looked better) is in fine comedic form, and he and Glenda Jackson complement each other perfectly.  She was especially singled out for critical acclaim -- some people compared her to Katharine Hepburn in Hepburn's comedic roles.
The movie also affords a look at London in the early 70's.
Because the actors work so well together, I would've liked a different (happier) ending for the movie.  Still, after thirty years, ""A Touch of Class"" remains very watchable and poignant -- largely because of the two stars.",1036886400,43,698,4.568
318765,5,6301229371,"...and I'm not easy to please.  It's strange when you realize just how sexy George Segal was.  But the movie is wonderfully written, sharp, smart and incredibly funny.  I saw another reviewer liked The Goodbye Girl better.  I prefered this...Sharper, more biting, less sentimental.  That doesn't mean it's heartless or even cynical, just that it's lacking in syrup.  George Segal and Glenda Jackson have the all the chemistry and the comedic chops (and then some) needed to make this movie work.  This movie made me laugh a lot, was sexy enough to warm any cold night and smart enough to make me feel like the people who made it figured I had at least a high school education.  How come comedic movies this smart don't get made by the major studios anymore?",1020038400,28,757,4.681818181818182

319164,4,6301229371,"A TOUCH OF SLEAZE is a 1 hour and 46 minute color movie from 1973, starring George Segal (born 1934) and Glenda Jackson (born 1936).  In a nutshell, two professional Londoners in their late 30s, interested in feeding their animal passions, decide to engage in a week of hanky-panky in a vacation resort in Spain. However, a series of improbable and amusing incidents sets up a variety of roadblocks to their plans. The screenplay is filled with lively barbs and amusing bickering.

The film begins with an aerial shot of the Thames River in London, with bridges at the center, castles to the left, and apartment buildings to the right. The first scene is in an urban park, with horseback riders, and a baseball game. One of the baseball players wears a sweatshirt reading, ""HILLEL"" (a Jewish organization) while another player has a shirt reading, ""TURETSKY'S DELI"" (Turetsky's Deli has no presence on the internet).  Mr. Segal is in the outfield, about to catch a ball, and he trips over a boy. The boy is Jackson's son. ""Give me my ball, will you lady,"" says Segal. ""Give me my kid, will you mister, if you finish trampling on him, that is,"" returns Jackson, establishing the theme of good-natured barbs that pepper the entire screenplay. The umpire yells, ""FAIR BALL."" Then, Segal from the outfield, yells and screams, disagreeing with the umpire. Segal picks up the boy and brushes him off, demonstrating that he has an inherent good nature. Jackson is the first to flirt, and Segal immediately detects this flirt.

The next scene occurs in a rainstorm, perhaps a week later, when Segal and Jackson serendipitously meet while waiting for a taxi. Segal is the first to make a move, and he asks Jackson out for a date for afternoon tea. Segal asks her if she is concerned about the inconvenience of a 4 o'clock tea date. Jackson responds, ""Don't cross-examine me in the rain, I'll be there."" This is another example of the gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) barbs that the pair exchanges with each other in this movie.

The next barbs are exchanged the following day at the tea date, when Jackson exclaims, ""From the way you played baseball, obviously you don't do that for a living."" Then, they describe their own marriages. Of his own marriage, Segal says, ""We've been married for 11 years and in all that time, I've never been unfaithful to her in the same city."" (This reminds me of a line from NORTH BY NORTHWEST, where Cary Grant says, ""I never make love to a woman on an empty stomach."" This line was spoken by Cary Grant, but the censors replaced the soundtrack with a different sentence.)

At twelve minutes into A TOUCH OF CLASS, the pair is already discussing ""doing it."" They migrate from the dining room of the hotel ot a bedroom suite upstairs. Jackson says, ""You have brought me to this hideaway with the intention, I presume, of getting me into bed for what you men so charmingly call a quickie?"" Segal responds, ""Why do you women always think the worst? Why does sex always have to be the first thing that . . . YES!"" Then, Jackson complains about the hotel room, referring to it as an ""overworked little joy-station where the sheets haven't been changed in a week . . . and I have to be back in my office in, Christ, a half an hour."" Jackson suggests that they have a tryst out of town. At 14 minutes into the movie, Segal has decided that the tryst will occur in Malaga, Spain. The next scene takes place in Jackson's office, which is in a company that manufactures knock-offs of clothing that had been designed by high-profile fashion designers. The movie does a good job at showing Jackson's work routine, and her interactions with her co-workers.

At 18 minutes into the movie, Segal is at the travel agent, and from that point on, until the end of the movie, the viewer is treated to an amusing romp of overblown misunderstandings, and amusing turns-of-fate that cause Segal and Jackson to be annoyed. For example, at the airport in London, Segal runs into a professional colleague (Walter) who is also booking a flight to Malaga. The result is that Segal must conceal the fact that he is with Jackson. This proves to be a challenging inconvenience to Segal, as he must conceal the fact that he is with Jackson, during the airplane flight, during his negotiations with rental car agency, and during his vacation activities in Malaga.

CONCLUSION. Although the script and the acting are excellent, and although the repartees and reposts were a pleasure to listen to and watch, what I found annoying was the unquestioned advocacy of hanky-panky.  This unquestioned advocacy is a continual theme in this movie.",1400371200,4,4634,4.718170580964153

The sparks fly and the chemistry is lucious between George Segal & Glenda Jackson, and you will roar with laughter, until the final 10 minutes.

319351,5,6301229371,"A first rate comedy, with just a tough of pathos, and a British rather than American ending.  George Segal gives a masterful performance, again working with one of the five best modern actresses (Glenda Jackson here and Jane Fonda in ""Fun With Dick & Jane"").  Jackson is in turns acerbic, sympathetic, and loving, a restrained, sophisticated performance, proving that great dramatic actresses can do good comedy.  The story is well written and directed, as Segal's one night stand evolves into a relationship.  Paul Sorvino gives a solid supporting performance. This is a movie for your permanent collection.",1270166400,9,608,5.237113402061856

7810192,2,6301229371,"So dated that it is worth watching as a historical document of what counted as edgy romantic comedy in the early 70s. There is zero chemistry between the leads. And Glenda Jackson won the Oscar for this!?!?  When British actors get together to laugh about how Americans fall for their accents, this could be exhibit A.  If you were alive in the 70s, the cheesy music including original songs (yes!) may put a smile on your face.",1517270400,,428,4.545454545454546
