8313112,5,B001JMVXVS,"I am a multi-discipline healthcaregiver, with professional training in Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias and end-of-life care issuea.  I am also the 24/7 primary caregiver for my mother-in-law, afflicted with ""multi-infarct Dementia"".  This video in two parts is VERY fast paced.  Most of the information presented in this video was good review for me and could be a starting place for others who care for others afflicted with Alz. Disease and related dementias.  The medication discussed is no longer used, but there are newer medications, likely not available when this video was produced.  Other references describe the hallmark plaques and tangles in a different and more imaginable manner.  Where this production ""shines"" is in the second part about wandering.  Thankfully, so far, we have not experienced this troubling behavior.  Some of the resons presented for wandering here make logical sense.  What we all have to remember, however is dementia's behaviors don't necessarily make logical sense.  Why do some wander and ""sundown"" and others don't?  Nobody knows.  This presenter did make emphasis, that EVERYBODY afflicted with any of the Dementias are at risk for wandering; & caregivers should keep vigilant for wandering to happen, no matter how much difficulty the person affliced has in getting around.  I thought it interesting that people who wander are gone for longer than 24 hours are unlikely to return safe & uninjured.  Bottom line: this was money well-spent for the review and the education about wandering.  I would recommend those who care for people afflicted with Alz. Disease and Dementias to view this video - more than once.",1338768000,9,1664,5.273764258555133
