8644654,5,B00IQDU9AO,"I'm a software developer and was looking for something to help balance out my stress while working. I don't have room for an aquarium, but I do have 3 monitors, which provides a spot for some underwater friends. I've found myself playing this once or twice a day on my far right monitor while working. The serenity helps me focus.  Good audio and visuals. Best of all, though, are the seahorses.  I've never seen anything so cool (with regards to aquariums). My daughter and I also watched it on the TV and she loves the shots of ""Nemo and Dory"", but was still amazed at the variety of other fish. Would highly recommend!",1471824000,,621,4.486725663716814
8644655,3,B00IQDU9AO,I have them all and were I a teacher I would grade this one maybe a C- Here's why. I think that it really IS shot through the side of an Aquarium ( A very small and cheap one.) The reflection of the fish on the back of the tank is really distracting and in one scene the star of the show is the Pump and bubbling equipment hanging down in the tank. My 13 year old grandson could do as well with his Cam Corder shooting through that fish tank over at Flannagans restaurant in Boca Raton. I never send anything back especially when it is a low end item. I will give it to my Mailman.  JC,1402704000,,585,3.9159663865546217

8644657,5,B00IQDU9AO,"Kids love it, wife loves it.  Very relaxing to have playing in the background while doing homework and making dinner.  Vibrant fish and calming music.  Worth purchasing.",1397606400,,169,5.185185185185185
8644658,5,B00IQDU9AO,The fish are sooo graceful and their colors are vibrant. This video is much simpler then maintaining an actual aquarium. Plus these fish never die even if you forget to feed them :),1394668800,,181,4.515151515151516
