8106469,5,B000E6ESFI,"Here's a list of the movies in this set: Three Broadway Girls (1932), Doll Face (1946), Moonlight Sonata (1937), Second Chorus (1940), Mr. Imperium (1951), Manhattan Merry Go Round (1937), Royal Wedding (1951), Happy Go Lovely (1951), Glorifying the American Girl (1930), the Stork Club (1945).

Two of these are Fred Astaire movies without Ginger Rogers.

Glorifying the American Girl is a movie set at the Ziegfeld Follies (a lot of it backstage).

Moonlight Sonata has the classical piano master Paderewski playing the piano. The first 20 minutes is just of him playing. He is 77 years old here, and he died shortly after this movie was made. The movie also stars Charles Farrell.

I just ordered it and have not received it or watched it, just passing on some information that I found while doing research to decide whether or not to buy. Amazon has no info at all on this page, so I thought it would be helpful to add some. :-)",1438819200,5,932,4.664634146341464

8106472,3,B000E6ESFI,If I had been aware of the contents of these DVDS I probably wouldn't have ordered this set. There are too many duplications of other sets that I have. If ths your first purchase of vintage musicals you will probably be satisfied with the ones included.,1221782400,2,253,4.521739130434782
