8434852,2,B004LUQFGI,"This must be the dullest spy movie ever filmed.  It's about 50% travelogue and 50% movie-of-the-week ""action.""  With a few tweaks it probably could have been noir-ish and interesting but the script has a tendency to gloss over its own darker points, to its loss.

Burt Reynolds stars as a charisma-free spy who initially doubles as a walking poster for sexual harrassment.  In a scene that reminded me of Billy Madison, of all things, an oddly-accented French spy lady tries to teach Burt about SE Asia while they are flying from DC to ""Saigon"".  He is clearly more interested in the spy lady herself, to no avail.  Poor lady.  Would you want to be stuck in a DC8 over the Pacific with him invading your personal space and trying to make out with you every 10 seconds?  Maybe it was the thin airplane air, because once he hits the ground, he turns completely sexless.  Other observations:

-As a travelogue, it somewhat fails, not just since it is filmed in BKK instead of Saigon, but also because these would be the parts of the movie to benefit from color the most.
-The spy's papers at the beginning are charred and smoking after the bomb goes off, then we cut directly to the papers in DC, what must be several days afterwards...still appearing to smoke.  I LOLed then realized that it was Burt's cigarette smoking, not the paper.  A near-brush with Ed Wood-ian incompetence (or TOP SECRET lulz) there.
-I was surprised at the movie showing casualties from a grenade attack, but the script doesn't dwell on them - one horrified look from Burt and it never comes up again (""MESSAGE!!!"").
-It seemed like some of the Thai cast were utilizing Muay Thai fighting principles - would have been interesting to have more of this.
-I was also quite surprised at the early, no-nonsense hatcheting of the giggling villain - not in a bad way necessarily, but the script then doesn't take advantage of the ""now we don't know who the enemy is"" situation well enough.  It just provides the next villain immediately.
-The ""woman in peril"" double crosses Burt to save her father, which would make a lot more sense in the script if Burt were going to help her redeem herself.  Nah...she catches a stray bullet in the name of dramatic economy.
-The forced ""romantic"" goodbye at the end could have come right from AIRPLANE!: ""I don't ever want to say goodbye to you."" *walks to plane*

The DVD transfer is unremarkable.  I'd not buy this again, however thanks to Warner Archive for getting it out there for me to scorn.",1376870400,,2503,4.64172335600907
8434853,3,B004LUQFGI,"At least Burt Reynolds recovered from this, his first lead role.  This movie is pretty bad - but bad enough to be a must-see (yes, I know - ""?!"").  I gave it three stars purely because of its comedy value and nice Asian setting (and Vic Diaz, tee hee hee hee hee!). It has its moments - and the plot, while basic, is pretty solid. I do hope they took no more than four days to shoot this thing, though.

Set in mid-1960s Saigon (South Vietnam) but filmed in Bangkok (Thailand), the producers made no effort to hide the hundreds of Thai signs and Buddhist temples seen throughout. At least they could've filmed the drive from ""Tan Son Nhut airport"" into downtown Saigon in a bus that didn't read ""Thai International"" on the sides. Even Burt's hotel boasts a Thai sign in front. I've been to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), incidentally; it's a great place. The only religious spires that really stand out, though, are on the Catholic cathedral ""downtown.""

The acting was poor, but Vic Diaz played a decent villain (should've been developed as a character more).  Other items worth noting - the French woman with the thick Asian accent (raised in Indochina according to her, but she must've been educated exclusively by Vietnamese or Cambodians), and the music, which sounds more appropriate for an episode of Bewitched than a spy thriller set in wartorn Vietnam. No Stones or Carmine Coppola here.

Watch it!  You'll talk about it afterward.",1357516800,,1436,4.697211155378486
8434854,4,B004LUQFGI,"For those who thought Burt Reynolds got his start in the 1970's this is a real gem.  The action sequences are great, the documentary look in black and white enhanses the movie.  Good stuff.  Nice to see Burt in a suit and tie and short hair.",1311120000,,241,4.195652173913044
