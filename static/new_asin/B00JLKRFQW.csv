Your not helpful, your actually deluding the them and destroying the great British Independent Film name.

Having a flashy dvd cover doesn't automatically mean a good film.
Filmmaking is an Art and there are so many well deserved 5 star rated British films made. Go out and support Great British Independent Filmmakers who know their craft.
DELUDED and TOO AMBITIOUS",1416355200,,447,4.96
8652224,2,B00JLKRFQW,"In the opening scene George Thompson (Piers Brunton) set on fire yelling out his brother Charlie's name (Steve Brunton) because...well we don't know why. It seems crime boss Cheltham (Paul Lee King) after over a decade wants some kind of vengeance on Charlie because....we don't know. So in order to flush out Charlie Cheltham has Danny Thompson (Tommy Ivers Grant) murdered, Charlie's nephew.

Charlie returns to the old neighborhood and reunites with a bunch of old overweight guys who still wear an earring. Revenge!... and save Frankie (Bert Truby) who appears to have attended the Daniel Radcliffe school of no facial expression acting.

Meanwhile there are cops who are voyeurs on everything going on. And oh yes, a few girls are forced to disrobe in the middle of the film, so we don't fall asleep.

The plot was not well constructed. The dialouge was bad and when it wasn't bad it was cliche. Cheltham is overly psychotic but lacks being entertaining.

This is a low end British gang film. I would go watch something with the word ""hooligan"" in it instead. 1 1/2 stars
