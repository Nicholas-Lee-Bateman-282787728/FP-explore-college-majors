8487629,1,B005VU9LAE,"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK.
  This is not a story of 2000 Years of Christianity, it is a story on how to knock anything about christianity, I should have ripped up the $10 I paid for this waste of 6 dvd's.",1424131200,,199,3.8292682926829267
8487630,1,B005VU9LAE,It is scripturally and historically incorrect.  Go to the Bible and/or an authentic historian such as Josephus.  Stay away from this film.,1419465600,,138,5.2272727272727275
8487631,5,B005VU9LAE,"I am very much interested in Church history or to say History of Christianity. I have collected many books and media materials including DVD.I have found this is one of best explained Church History I ever saw. I am a Christian Priest from a non Christian background, so the subject matter is very interesting. I have just started watching '2000 Years of Christianity' and completed 3 DVD. These are one of the best visual material to explain Christianity. Very good and profound. I found this has best visuals to explain lots of details. This is a product not created in USA or UK but may be in Germany. Seems I will watch this many times. I did not find this in any where made me feel boring or waste of time . Comes with nice box so we can preserve DVD's for a longer time. Also comes a Church History Timeline Poster and a booklet.
This is good material for Seminary student to understand the History of Christianity.",1403654400,2,921,4.488095238095238
8487632,2,B005VU9LAE,"Within  the first 15 minutes of viewing this otherwise professionally filmed documentary, the narrator's flippant slights to Bethlehem and Jerusalem's historically accepted most holy sites and identified Stephen as the Church's ""leader"" (not mentioning any Apostle, etc.), I lost interest.  In fact, before I knew it, I fell asleep and haven't any interest in watching the rest of the set.  I'd give only one star for hating the narration, if it hadn't been for the photography.",1361923200,8,478,5.2631578947368425
