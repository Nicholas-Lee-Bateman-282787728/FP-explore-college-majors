3003416,4,B000XJD39I,"""My Boyfriend's Back"" is a TV movie that first aired on September 25, 1989 on NBC.  The three leads had top-rated shows on NBC at the time - Sandy Duncan (The Hogan Family), Judith Light (Who's the Boss) & Jill Eikenberry (L.A. Law).

Three girls who grew up together became a 60s girl group, The Bouffants.  They had a hit song, ""My Boyfriend's Back"" ( a song performed by The Angels in 1963 in real life).  They fought over unworthy boys and who would sing lead, finally breaking up the group and the friendship.  Years later, a producer wants to feature them in a TV show; but getting them back together isn't easy.  One is a busy mom, one is a cosmetic executive and the other a lounge singer in a bowling alley.  The movie details their rocky road back to friendship.

This is a cute movie with a light feel.  Judith Light is terrific as Vickie, singing (her real voice) in the bowling alley in ridiculous costumes and over-the-top makeup.  She's funny and you'll find yourself pulling for her after all of her hard knocks.  Sandy Duncan is great, too, as the mom who has her own problems but is the balance and the glue in the friendship.  Jill Eikenberry's character doesn't have the most winning of personalities, but she comes around in the end.  I would have liked to have seen Vickie's character with a more secure ending, but that's my only complaint.

The final scene is like a PBS special with a lot of great retro acts:  Gary Puckett, Mary Wells, Peggy March & The Penguins all sing.

This is a good quality DVD that takes us back to a time when we had enjoyable weekly TV movies that weren't trying to teach us a lesson or make us feel morose.  It was just for the sake of fun, and you can't go wrong with that.  With this DVD, my boyfriend's back, and so is entertainment...Hey-la-day-la...",1398384000,5,1807,4.4407294832826745

3003440,5,B000XJD39I,"I 1st caught this movie the 1st and only time NBC aired it back in like 1990 or there-abouts. Lucky for me I had the smarts to shove a tape in and record it due to who was in it and have enjoyed that tape all these years later. Imagine my surprise when I found it here at Amazon on DVD. Needless to say my tape was beginning to show it's age in places. What makes this movie just a lot of fun is that it has a little bit of everything you would want in a movie. 3 old friends who shared a special time in their youth and have a chance to relive it if all really want to. It has slight intrigue, cat fights, making up and not to mention some darn good music from the 60's. 1 of the ladies is boss of company and just doesn't get why to do it. 1 is a married lady with 2 kids and a husband who loves but doesn't have time for her and her needs. 1 is still singing all these years later and wants it cause she think she deserves it because of what happened years ago. You laugh with them, you cry with them, you fight with them as they fight with each other. But, most of all, in the end all is mended and all is resolved from past to present to future. And after all that there is a swell 15 minutes or so of some of the excellent music hits from the 1960's performed by the original artists who made them famous!!When it's done I can promise you you'll watch it again and again and enjoy it every time. Expessially if you watch it with a friend or whatever is available. The 2 of you will enjoy it ALOT!!!Mark",1278374400,4,1508,3.9153094462540716

FYI HDTVs have captioning for the hearing impaired in Setup, Options, Captions. Subtitles will play during ordinary programs as well as for VHS tapes. So there is no need to increase TV volume as hearing clarity declines, or to purchase DVDs of favorite VHS tapes which you already own unless you are looking for increased visual clarity and Special Features Bonus interviews.",1280016000,2,4081,7.659574468085107
3237937,5,B000XJD39I,"I 1st caught this movie the 1st and only time NBC aired it back in like 1990 or there-abouts. Lucky for me I had the smarts to shove a tape in and record it due to who was in it and have enjoyed that tape all these years later. Imagine my surprise when I found it here at Amazon on DVD. Needless to say my tape was beginning to show it's age in places. What makes this movie just a lot of fun is that it has a little bit of everything you would want in a movie. 3 old friends who shared a special time in their youth and have a chance to relive it if all really want to. It has slight intrigue, cat fights, making up and not to mention some darn good music from the 60's. 1 of the ladies is boss of company and just doesn't get why to do it. 1 is a married lady with 2 kids and a husband who loves but doesn't have time for her and her needs. 1 is still singing all these years later and wants it cause she think she deserves it because of what happened years ago. You laugh with them, you cry with them, you fight with them as they fight with each other. But, most of all, in the end all is mended and all is resolved from past to present to future. And after all that there is a swell 15 minutes or so of some of the excellent music hits from the 1960's performed by the original artists who made them famous!!When it's done I can promise you you'll watch it again and again and enjoy it every time. Expessially if you watch it with a friend or whatever is available. The 2 of you will enjoy it ALOT!!!Mark",1278374400,4,1508,3.9153094462540716

8228495,3,B000XJD39I,"I had wanted to see this movie in the late 90s as an 11-year-old burning through re-runs of Who's the Boss?, my all-time favorite sitcom, but never caught it, so I was elated to find it on DVD.

As a fan of Hairspray, Mad Men, and all things 60s, I really enjoyed it, from the opening montage of newspaper clippings, photographs, record covers, and marquees from the heyday of The Bouffants, a fictitious girl group who was discovered in eighth grade glee club and eventually reached #1 on the Billboard charts with ""My Boyfriend's Back"" (in real life, a #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 for The Angels in 1963) before suddenly breaking up when lead singer Debbie McGuire (Jill Eikenberry) called it quits.

Twenty five years later, Vickie Vine (Judith Light, in a delightfully vampy, un-Angela Bower-esque turn) is a struggling singer at a bowling alley, where her patrons hardly listen and her contract-dodging boss uses her. Chris Henry (refreshingly bright-as-sunshine Sandy Duncan) is a housewife and stay-at-home mom frustrated by her sportscaster husband's frequent absence. Debbie, seemingly embarrassed by her musical past, is the senior vice president of marketing for multimillion-dollar cosmetics business L'Etoile and grapples with the decision to move in with her boyfriend of two years. It takes in-person visits from NBC exec Nick Simon (John Sanderford) and a lot of cajoling standoffish Debbie to get the group back to LA to participate in a 1960s musical retrospective named after their only #1 hit. After requisite obstacles -- resentment, self-doubt, and Debbie's temporary departure -- the old friends reconcile and close out the evening of performances (featuring Peggy March, Mary Wells, The Penguins, and Gary Puckett) with a bang.

I enjoyed the three lead characters, how each of them had a distinct personality as if they were sisters (Debbie as the responsible, reserved ""oldest,"" Chris as the cheerful, perfectionistic mediator ""middle child"", and Vickie as the frivolous, ostentatious ""youngest"") and the chance to shine in both comedic and dramatic scenes -- the sequence in which they settle into their hotel suite is particularly amusing and illustrative of their differences, and Vickie's ""SHUT UP!"" speech in the bowling alley, albeit brief, is moving. I had a hard time figuring with whom I identified the most. The 80s costumes are on point, especially Debbie's power suits and Vickie's over-the-top ensembles that resemble Troupe Beverly Hills' Phyllis Nefler's wardrobe, and Ms. Light wears them well. The cheesy 80s incidental music, not so much.

My complaints are more to do with the DVD/format itself. Early in the film, there are ripples onscreen as if I am watching a videocassette. There are no subtitles or closed captions. And worst of all, there are no special features (I know this was a television film), but I am grateful to have this fun film on DVD, period!",1434585600,,2914,5.1284210526315785
