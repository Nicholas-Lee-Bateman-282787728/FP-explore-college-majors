8058713,4,B0009A2YNW,"Fruits Basket is a great anime. It's about an orphaned girl who goes to live with a family of shape shifters. The members of the Sohma family are cursed. When they touch a member of the opposite sex they turn into a different animal in the Chinese Zodiac. The story follows Tohru and her life with this weird family.

I had a great time watching this anime and I think it's fantastic. That being said; it lacked something that could have made it a lot better. Emotion. There were some touching moments. Like the story of the family's doctor, and the ending where Kyo turns into his true form. If the relationships between the characters were developed a little more, instead of everyone being so stand offish the whole time those moments could have been more memorable. I'm not bashing this series at all. I actually really like it. My point is that it had way more potential than was actually achieved.

The animation in Fruits Basket is high quality. The soundtrack and voice acting are also very good. The anime was produced masterfully. It's a classic, but it's a far cry from being one of the best anime's of all time. That being said it's definitely not one to miss.",1354060800,,1172,4.549763033175355
8058714,1,B0009A2YNW,"Fruits Basket is a fine series, but do not waste your money on this item.
These disks were given away for free by a number of retailers as a promotion from the publisher Funimation.  This contains only the first 2 episodes, which you would have to by again to get the whole series.

Try buying the Viridian Collection or at least volume 1 of the series. If you have any love for the series, you will kick yourself when you realize the money you wasted on this item.",1254441600,7,465,4.2727272727272725
8058715,5,B0009A2YNW,"I believe that Fruits Baskets is a wonderful and heart warming tale about a family possesed by a curse and ruled by a godlike figure, Akito. Fruits Baskets is the top selling manga in the US and it has all the characteristics of a great anime tale.  Takaya performs an unbelieve job with her all time greatest hit, Fruits Baskets, and I hope more people will be able to fall in love with the charm and warmth of this unforgettable story of life, love and survival.",1137369600,8,464,4.395348837209302
