I would sit and watch at least 4 episodes back to back. Crazy I know but I wanted more. I really love all of the actors on this show. They each are special in their own unique way! :) Even at times this show makes me think about my own life and laugh about it! I cannot wait until Season 2 comes out!",1284422400,,428,3.875

After the relative disaster that was Dirt, Courteney Cox comes back with a winnner here. Ok, she kind of plys the Monica from Friends characer but that is ok.

4117603,4,B003F3NDOO,"In 2009, Bill Lawrence (co-creator of ""Scrubs"" and ""Spin City"") and Kevin Biegel thought about a TV series that revolved around single people in their 40's getting back on the dating scene and for Lawrence, said he was also inspired by his wife, actress Christa Miller (who also stars on the show ""Cougar town"", ""Scrubs"" and ""The Drew Carry Show"") and her life when she walked out of the shower, went in front of the mirror and flashed it.  By that action alone plus their ideas of featuring a 40-year-old trying to get back into the dating scene, the idea of ""Cougar Town"" was born.

""Cougar Town"" is a sexual comedy sitcom which revolves around Jules Cobb (played by Courteney Cox, ""Friends"", ""Dirt"", ""Scrubs""), a 40-year-old divorcee who is a single mother raising her teenage son Travis (played by Dan Byrd, ""Aliens in America"", ""Heroes"") and also is successfully business owner who owns her own estate business.  Having been divorced for eight months, Jules now wants to have fun and enjoy life like a single woman would.  No strings tied, no relationships, just to have fun and most of all, having some sexual freedom in her life.

But of course, she's learning quickly that entering in the dating game (and not wanting a relationship) at age 40 is not too easy, especially if your eyes are in younger men.

Fortunately for Jules, she has a support system which includes her next door neighbor and best friend Ellie Torres (played by Christa Miller).  Ellie inspires Jules because she is married and has managed to make her marriage work.  Ellis is also a voice of reason and a friend she grew up with and since both Jules and Ellie tend to do everything together.  Ellie is married to Andy (played by Ian Gomez, ""Rita Rocks""), who is a man that loves to eat, tries to be a good husband but also has lazy tendencies as well.  Together both Ellie and Andy are new parents and raising a baby and do all they can to keep their marriage happy and functioning.

When Jules is not hanging out with Ellie, she hangs out with her young, promiscuous (and not-so-smart) assistant named Laurie (played by Busy Phillips, ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", ""Made of Honor"").  Laurie is all about hooking up with men, having fun and despite not being a great assistant, Jules enjoys her company because she is part of the young single scene and hopes her assistant can take her to areas where she can meet younger men.

And because Jules has friendships with both Ellie and Laurie and both woman are quite the opposite from each other, these ladies don't really get along but for Jules sake, they manage to hang out together for their good friend.

Meanwhile, Jules is still close with her ex-husband Bobby (played by Brian Van Holt, ""John from Cincinnati"", ""Threshold"") who loves to party, drink beer, play golf, and is a custodian at his son's school and lives on a boat parked in a driveway.  Despite Bobby knowing why the reason he got divorced with his wife is because of his issues with infidelity, he does care for his ex-wife and wants to have some sort of relationship with Travis.

Another man in Jules life is a man named Grayson Ellis (played by Josh Hopkins, ""Private Practice""), a 40-something bar owner, who lives across the street.  Grayson irks Jules because young women constantly come out of his home (and Jules is jealous that its easier for older men to get back into the dating game compared to herself, an older woman).  But both because of their initial rivalry, Jules wants to be friends with Grayson and encourage him to join the neighborhood activities within the neighbors living in the cul-de-sac.

Throughout the season, we get to see each of these people who are close to Jules, end up being close friends and are there for each other in times of need.

""Cougar Town - The Complete First Season"" features a total of 24 episodes presented on three DVD's.

VIDEO:

""Cougar Town - The Complete First Season"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhance for 169 Televisions.  For a DVD series, picture quality is good and with a lot of the series shot outdoors and inside with a lot of lighting, the series looks pretty good on DVD.  There are compression artifacts as expected from a DVD release but it's not that bad.  So far, ""Cougar Town - The Complete Series"" is a good looking TV series on DVD and fans of the show should be happy with its picture quality on DVD.

It's important to note that Amazon has a listing for a ""Cougar Town"" Blu-ray release and if that is the case, I can imagine that this series would look fantastic on Blu, especially since the series has a lot of outdoor scenes.  Definitely a series that has the potential to show off quite a bit of detail and vibrant colors on HD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first started watching ""Cougar Town"", I admit that I thought the first initial episodes turned me off.  To watch these cougars fawning over high school boys and watching Jules, a 40-year-old woman going to nightclubs where younger people frolic and then hanging out with students and playing beer pong was something I just had no interest in.  But I stuck with the series and sure enough, things got better.

As the first few episodes did focus on the ""cougar"" aspect of older women going after young men, the series began to be more about relationships and friendships.  The series literally became much more fun to watch and easily a series that will appeal to both men and women.  I enjoyed how the series started to include more storylines that revolve around the people closer to her.  For example, her son Travis is constantly being embarrassed by Jules and his father Bobby and friends.  But he's a graduating teen who wants to lose his virginity and it's interesting to see how he goes about that and also tries to take advice from his father, his neighbor Andy and Laurie.

Meanwhile, the Torres family are hilarious to watch.  Ellie and Andy have a fun relationship, especially how they plan their daily lives with each other.  May it be taking care of a child to planning their sexual nights.  But of course, as Ellie is a big support for Jules, Andy on the other hand is like the comedic character as he tries to be the confident man who knows about women in front of Travis and also becomes the follower when it comes to him hanging out with Bobby and Grayson.

Meanwhile Grayson is the guy who loves to be with younger women but suddenly finds himself interested in Jules and Bobby, the ex-husband who is loud and obnoxious but also starting to noticed the woman he lost because of his infidelity problem.

And then you have Laurie, your stereotypical blonde floozy who is just a promiscuous woman who just doesn't care.  She just loves to have fun and there's no stopping her.

Also, this is role that suits Courteney Cox quite well.  As she was an actress that absolutely shined on ""Friends"", it's great to see her in a sitcom that is just fun to watch and also to see her character evolve. It's quite hilarious and you just have to love the hand ""guns"" and her ""bing"" chest bumps.  And as I enjoyed watching Courteney Cox, it was also great to see Christa Miller (who I absolutely enjoyed on ""The Drew Carey Show"" and ""Scrubs"") in the supportive role as Jules best friend.  Both Cox and Miller have great chemistry (as best friends) and to see both sitcom veterans together on one show is pretty awesome!

Another element that I enjoyed with ""Cougar Town"" is the guest appearances.  It was cool to see Sheryl Crow play the wine client Sara who starts dating Grayson and also to see ""Friends"" star Lisa Kudrow playing the mean doctor and dating Jules ex-husband Bobby.  And now, hopefully we will see an appearance by another ""Friends"" alum on the show... Jennifer Aniston anyone?  Or even one of the male ""Friends"" characters.

Overall, ""Cougar Town"" is a series with a colorful cast and I found myself enjoying the episodes more when they focused on everyone as a collective rather than always focusing on Jules.  And the fact that you have series creator and writer Bill Lawrence involved in the series, you do get that ""Scrubs"" adult humor type of feel when watching ""Cougar Town"".  Also, I liked how the series is contained within 30-minute episodes, it's easier to follow and much more easier to take in.

The DVD release for ""Cougar Town - The Complete First Season"" is definitely enjoyable DVD release and you get all 24-episodes and a good number of special features.  So, fans of the series should not be disappointed.

I admit that ""Cougar Town"" was much better than I expected and it's a comedy series that definitely caught my attention and will more than likely star watching it when the second season comes back on air.  For now, if you are curious about this series or are looking for a fun and hilarious adult-humored series on DVD, definitely give ""Cougar Town - The Complete First Season"" a try!",1282003200,19,10576,4.696525515743756
4117604,4,B003F3NDOO,"Unlike other who will review this DVD collection, I have never seen the show on television. So everything was new for me from the original pilot episode throygh the remaining 23 episodes of the first season. With the commercials excised, each episode lasts about 22 minutes and it's easy to watch three or four at a time. Actually, I found this helpful since this is more of a continuous story line where each episode generally picks up where the previous one ended.

For the newly initiated viewer the show looks like its going to be all sex and body jokes, and that's pretty much what it is for the first  five or six episodes. If you've watched Desperate Housewives and found the sexual humor of  40 year old women lusting after young men or their neighbors husband, you'll feel right at home here. In fact, I was not that familiar with Courtney Cox (well, some folks aren't ""Friends"" alums) and many times she reminded me of Teri Hatcher's character, Susan, in DH.

After five episodes the sex jokes began to get stale and I wondered how a whole season would hold out. But then, about episode six, all the characters who had separate relationships with Jules (Cox's character) met one another and now they became only happy (well, mostly) dysfunctional family. There's even a brief ""making of"" featurette in the bonuses where the creators discuss this issue. From that point on (the ""bonding"") the show takes a 90-degree turn and holds your interest - as well as tickles your funny bone.

Women of Jules' age will relate with her frustrations while men will find humor in the guys in the cast, though probably won't relate to them.  And this is one of those TV shows that has a killer soundtrack, inserting pop songs at just the right moment.

The bonuses include lots of deleted scenes (but in most cases you can easily see why they were deleted) and a blooper reel. There's a whole series of 2 minute ""Ask Barb"" videos where the ""older than the other women"" character, Barb, answers sex questions with risqu answers. And a similar set of videos starring the wacky Bobby Cobb (Cox's divorced husband in the show).

Fans of the show will want this to return to favorite episodes or moments. For others, especially those who want to see how a network show could push the sexually suggestive joke boundary, will find that, if they stick with it, the show will grow on you and keep you entertained.

4117605,5,B003F3NDOO,I watched this from epidose 1 and loved it.  The show seemed to start in one place and ended up going into a much better direction.  The first 2 or 3 episodes are good but as the season continues the characters get funnier and funnier.  They turn into people that you care about and want to see what the writers can come up with next.  Travis (the son) is great and he and Courtney (Jules) are wonderful together.  Actually they all are wonderful together and feed off one another very well. They really seem like that close extended friend family we all have or want.,1280275200,4,568,4.371428571428571
4117606,5,B003F3NDOO,"This show has everything in it that a sitcom should. Laugh out loud moments, friendships and great chemistry among the entire cast.
I loved Courtney Cox in Friends and she is even better in Cougar Town as Jules Cobb. Busy Phillips is a riot as her wild child asistant Laurie.
Josh Hopkins lights up the screen in every scene he is in and Brian  Van Holt is extremely charming and lovable. Ian Gomez is hilarious in his best role since Felicity. Christa Miller is also perfect in her role as Jule's bitchy but funny best friend ellie.
Don't miss this show!!!  It also features GREAT Music.",1274659200,6,588,4.537735849056604
4117607,4,B003F3NDOO,"Courteney Cox shines as Jules Cobb. Jules is a recently divorced woman in her 40's who is getting pushed into the dating scene by her much younger assistant. Jules wants companionship but like many of us realizes that there aren't many dating opportunities if you stick with men your own age, especially since they often prefer barely legal hotties. So, she gets pushed into dating younger men. The writers did a great job setting up the silliness of how difficult women make dating younger men while older men feel right at home dating younger women. It's funny because it pokes fun at the truth.  The show  isn't just about this though. It grows into having some underlying themes of what we want and settling. I think some of the funniest moments are the trials that Jules and her ex put their child through.

While I thought the first several episodes of Cougar Town were over the top corny I'm glad I kept watching because by the end of the season I was cracking up. The writing is fast paced, funny, and edgy at the same time. The acting while over the top in the beginning really hits it's mark by the end of season 1.

I have to admit that I originally would have canned this show but it radically improved during the season and now I can't wait for season 2 to start.",1272153600,6,1276,4.44017094017094

4117680,5,B003F3NDOO,"My boyfriend was out of town for work for the weekend and I wanted to find some new show that was cute and fun to watch while he was gone. So I decided to try out Cougar Town. Within that weekend I managed to get nothing done at home and watched all 24 episodes of Season 1! (Each episode is around 22 minutes long, so it was way too easy to just keep letting them continue) I just couldn't stop watching it and at times even found myself laughing hysterically out loud. I am pretty in love with this show and will now have to buy the rest of the seasons.

Unlike some sitcoms, this show does have a continuous story line  along with each episode's own problem and situation that usually gets solved with in the episode. So it was really nice for watching it for the first time to be able to watch them all in order and all at once.

Cougar Town is about a 40 something recently divorced woman, Jules, who is played by Courtney Cox (Friends), who is discovering how to get through life after her divorce and getting back into the dating world. Jules is a real estate agent who has a younger girl working for her named Laurie (played by Busy Phillips- Dawson's Creek). Jules is not just Laurie's boss but also her really good friend and wants to show Jules how to have fun. Jules's best friend Ellie (played by Christa Miller- The Drew Carey Show, Scrubs) lives next door with her husband Andy (Ian Gomez- The Drew Carey Show) and their newborn son. Ellie's personality is just fantastic and she is absolutely hilarious and fun to watch. Laurie and Ellie have a very amusing budding relationship where they find each other quite annoying but have to learn to tolerate each other for the sake of Jules. Jules also has a son Travis (Dan Byrd- A Cinderella Story) who is going through his senior year in high school with is parents embarrassing him as much as they possibly can in a very fun way. Travis's father which is also Jules's ex husband is Bobby (Brian Van Holt) which is another fun character that is also having to deal with the aftermath of his divorce. Jules and Bobbie throughout Season 1 are trying to find themselves and learning how to be friends with one another. Then we are introduced to Grayson (Josh Hopkins) who is another man who lives on the culdesac with Jules and Ellie. Grayson is also going through a recent divorce and owns a bar and is kinda known to always be bringing home some new young girl every night.

Throughout the first season all the characters are getting to know each other better, are forming new relationships, and are finding themselves after life events such as getting divorced or having a baby.  I think my favorite part from this season was watching the relationship form between Jules and Grayson. You can see the tension building between them, you know they like each other, and you just can't wait until they do something about it! I think this is one of the main things that kept making me click ""next episode"" each time because I just couldn't wait and wanted to see what happens next.",1439251200,5,3037,4.464864864864865

The humor is well played it's just too bad this is the last season it will be on meaning 2015 season not season one.  I highly recommend this to anyone that love community feel good shows.

I wasn't expecting Emmy quality stuff when I ordered Cougar Town, but I thought it might be a little fun, mindless entertainment.  Well, there's little that's fun about it: truly horrible acting - and I'm talking D quality, not B.  The scripting is just as I titled my review:  insipid.  Mindless entertainment?  Oh, yeah!  You betcha!  What I cannot understand are all the glowing Amazon reviews.",1408406400,,501,4.655172413793103

It wasn't anything like I thought it would be and there was a marathon going on that day so I watched all day. It took a little while for me to figure out who everyone was because I started in the middle of the second season but even taking that into account it was still so good that I immediately ordered the first season unseen.,1373068800,,590,4.094827586206897

Thank goodness it is surviving; but it shouldn't have to try so hard to stay alive. Courtney Cox is a genius producer. Thank you! No laugh tracks!!! Again thank you Courtney!! I hate laugh tracks and I know how brave you gotta be to try going without them on American television. Maybe all shows could remove laugh tracks from the DVD releases.

We hoped to see a bit more witty dialog to this, and after waiting years to first catch it, had expectations that it might be more watchable.

But while the premise had promise, the reparte was lacking.  The editing was choppy, and the soundtrack sound effects got annoying after about 1&1/2 episodes.

4117980,3,B003F3NDOO,"The first season of Cougar Town is nearly half good. The very first few episodes are quite entertaining, but then the show just only gets worse and worse. I have the impression that the writers did not have a clear idea of a direction to take. They had this potential idea of cougars but did not develop it. I too think it is not an easy thing to get this idea going. I mean, how long could they run a show about cougar activities? It would seem that at one point it would have gotten too boring. Or, they might have thought that the show would have taken the same form as Sex and the City. Regrettably, the show turned into a caricature of Friends.
In any event, they could have exploited the idea of Jules being a single cougar for at least another season. Unfortunately, they decide that by the end of season 1, Jules would fall in love and have a relationship with Grayson. So, once everybody is married or engaged, there no longer is a show.
The show also shoots itself in the foot when they devise such (trite) expedients as the penny can. The actors also are to blame for the mediocrity of the show. Cox is no genius. The actor who plays Grayson is not too bad. However, Christa Miller is just plain boring. Her character is fruitlessly obnoxious.  She is in the show, I think, only because she is married to the producer.  Busy Philipps is somehow amusing at first, but after a few episodes her jokes and attitude becomes contrived to a point that is not funny anymore.
Brian Van Holt as Bobby Cobb, as Jules' ex husband is perfect in (again) the first few episodes. We immediately learn why his marriage did not work out: he is not the family type. He successfully portrays the archetypical white American douche bag, but a very likable douche bag.  But then, he becomes a very good father and a wise man. It is clear that the writers here were struggling trying to pin down a precise character, but failed. Also, he is the ex husband and yet he is always around. That is not believable. And not only is he always in Jules' house, but he also has occasional sex with her, though only once.
Jules' son Dan Byrd soon graduates from high school and is supposed to go to college. But he will never leave, as one learns in season 2. However, his character does not bring anything interesting to the table. He is dull.
The writers of this show clearly had some issues deciding which direction to take and how to develop the characters. The result therefore is what it is: a good starting idea ruined by undecided writers and mediocre actors, and a show that is dead before the end of season 1.",1343088000,,2596,4.392931392931393

We were enjoying the 3rd CD of season 1 and it stopped playing (at one of the most exciting parts) it was tiring attempting to fix the problem. With no luck, we finally moved on to the next CD and it was fine. Just diappointed, I should have viewed sooner to ask for a replacement.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cougar-Town-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B003F3NDOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cougar Town: The Complete First Season</a>",1336089600,,622,5.688172043010753

4118014,5,B003F3NDOO,"I, like a lot of the other reviewers, was not a huge fan of the first few episodes of Cougar Town. I stuck with it though and at some point it became must see TV.  I think it was right around the time they ditched the stupid Courteney Cox as a cougar plot line and started focusing on the crazy exploits of the Cul de Sac Crew.  This show is both hilarious and heart felt. It has the ability to bring the viewer in so you feel like you are part of this crazy group each week. The writers reward long time viewers with inside jokes and references that casual viewers might not catch. It is, in my opinion, one of the best comedies out there right now.  The characters form a tight group that could be any group of friends of any age. If you liked the comedy of Scrubs then check this show out! If you watch Community (which judging by the ratings you probably don't) then you know these two shows have a mutual affection for one another so if you like Community, I think you'll like Cougar Town. If you like Parks and Rec I think you will LOVE Cougar Town because it has the same mix of eccentric comedy joined with genuine heartfelt love amongst the characters that makes Parks & Rec so loveable.  So give Cougar Town a try! Don't be discouraged if the first few episodes are kind of blah, it gets better. Much better!",1324857600,2,1318,4.218253968253968
4118015,5,B003F3NDOO,"This show is quick witted and very well-written, with a great cast. The show starts off slowly, with a theme that revolves around Courtney Cox's character acting like a 'Cougar' and dating younger men. However a few episodes into the series the show seemed to hit it's stride as the characters developed into those reflected on the show today. The cast has great chemistry, and their comedic plays on one another are fantastic. The show thankfully evolved into one that is about a tight-knit group of friends (the cul-da-sac crew!) and all of the ways their lives interact. There is quite a bit of talk about the show getting a new name in it's upcoming 3rd season, which I personally feel would be a blessing. This is a show that is about far more than 'Cougars' - and I think people fail to give it a fair chance because of the title. If you like shows with like Scrubs, Modern Family, and yes, Courtney's own little hit - Friends - I suggest you give Cougar Town a try.",1315267200,2,972,4.466292134831461
4118016,5,B003F3NDOO,Cougar Town is my fave show!! At first it did take me a few episodes to get into it - I thought the jokes weren't very clever - but I'm glad I stuck it out as now I cant get enough of this kooky bunch. Love it!!,1310342400,2,211,3.5106382978723403
4118017,1,B003F3NDOO,"This show gets 5 stars for staring the awesome Courtney Cox.  Cox is amazing, gorgeous, and I'd watch her play a tree in a kindergarten production.  But the show drops to 4 stars because of the lousy sets.  In no way does this show look like it's set in South-Central Florida (in one scene there's hills in the BG!) and the homes look about as lived in as a soap opera set.  Note to set designers: Watch ""Invasion,"" ""Burn Notice"" or ""Dexter""--other Florida based shows with FAR superior ""Florida-ish"" set design.  The mediocre writing drops the show down another notch to 3 stars.  The dialog and scenarios are mostly a snooze and every episode is SO similar that they all ""blur"" together and it feels like every episode you're watching the same episode over and over again.  The supporting cast takes it down to a 2 star show--not sure if you could find more bland supporting actors, and my God, her ""teen"" son looks like he's a 35-year-old accountant.  But what absolutely destroys the show and nose dives it down to a 1 star is BUSY PHILLIPS.  My God, how does one even begin to describe the horrible ""actor"" that is Busy?  Let's put it this way, a 55-year-old, 400-pound, chain-smoking, white trash, trailer-park-living grandmother with no teeth would have more sex appeal on this show than Busy Phillips.  The barrel-chested, broad-shouldered, wide-bottomed man-thing that is Busy Phillips should in no way be cast in this show.  It renders the show unwatchable.  Note to casting agents and producers: Please ""kill off"" Busy Phillips' character and ""re-cast"" BIJOU Phillips instead.  Same initials, same last name, same white trash vibe, only Bijou is about a billion times sexier and a far better actor.  It's called entertainment, folks!  We want to watch pretty, sexy and/or actually funny and likable actors.  Not ""things"" like Busy.  Oh, and God, is her voice annoying!!!  You hear if and you want to kill yourself.  And is there a Get-Busy-Phillips-Off-TV campaign website?  Because someone needs to start one.",1306627200,3,2021,4.885294117647059
4118018,5,B003F3NDOO,"This show got so many bad reviews because it started out all wrong, but now it's totally amazing! No, it's not about a divorcee hunting younger dudes - the overarching theme is so much more important than that: adult friendship. The writing is amazing (and only gets better in the second season) and the chemistry between cast members is unlike anything I've seen since Scrubs!

This panel discussion DVD, featuring all the main characters plus creators/producers, is phenomenal!

4118020,5,B003F3NDOO,"Cougar Town, despite the unfortunate title, is the best comedy since Everybody Loves Raymond.  The cast is incredible.  Each character has his or her own ineffable charm.  The jokes come out of nowhere.  Each episode is worthy of repeat viewing.  It's like Friends, except sophisticated and about grown-ups.

This is the first show I have ever purchased on DVD!  You really must try it.  But, like a few other reviewers suggested, give it several episodes.  Its quirky, unexpected, so-fast-you-might-miss-it humor takes a little while to get at first, but once you do it's priceless.
