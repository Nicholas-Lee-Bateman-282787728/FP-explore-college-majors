I picked this up from Walmart out of the $5 bin thinking ""Hey, I loved this show as a kid!"" What I expected to be ten random amazing episodes from the entire series turned out to be the first ten episodes of there series. Don't get me wrong, there are some great episodes on this disc, but it is certainly a leap to call them the ten best of the series. For starters, where is the Halloween episode? Or the time traveling one? Or the one with the flashbacks to Carmen working for ACME? All of these were some of the best episodes of the series. Not to mention the whole arc with Lee Jordan or Carmen's father. And how could I forget the episode where Carmen fakes her death?? All of these should have been added instead of some of the ones on this disc.

Finally, my last complaint would be the false advertising on the back of the box. On the back, the image clearly shows Carmen fighting with an octopus. This scene is from the aforementioned episode of flashbacks from Carmen's ACME days. That episode IS NOT ON THIS DISC. I can accept that they named the DVD the ""best of"" Carmen Sandiego, because it probably helped sales. However, I do not appreciate them trying to push that that one episode is on the disc when it actually isn't.

All in all though, this is a quality product that helped bring back the nostalgia of the good old days. Despite my qualms, I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the series, but isn't prepared to buy the whole thing without watching a little bit of it first. So go ahead and buy it if you haven't seen much of or any of the series yet. You won't be disappointed, I promise.

See you next crime, Player.",1399161600,3,1906,4.3008356545961

8505533,4,B006WCPRC6,"I received The Best of Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? in a DVD giveaway package I won from a blog several weeks ago. The show aired in 1994 and ended in 1998. I vaguely recall the series ever airing as I was a thirteen-year-old and I was more into horror movies at the time. The series is based on the popular pc/video game and the PBS kid's game show; both titled Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?. Thanks to Cookie Jar (Mill Creek Entertainment) this cartoon and others are now available on DVD.

The show takes place in a virtual reality where a 'live' kid known as ""The Player"" is playing the game as two sibling characters Zack and Ivy, who are both ACME detectives. Carmen Sandiego is the main thief along with her V.I.L.E gang, who in each episode steals an artifact and travels the world to through off the authorities. This is where Zack and Ivy come in as they must find the clues Carmen leaves behind and figure out her next move. Of course at the end of every episode, the kids recover the artifact and Carmen gets away.

A lot of cartoons in the 80s and early 90s got a lot of heat from Congress over their violence and for being non-educational. In 1994 Fox Kids aired the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the X-Men which contained some violence, therefore Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?.

  If Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? aired a few years earlier, I probably still wouldn't have watched it, as I was more into TMNT, Thundercats, etc... Now as an adult, I enjoyed watching these ten episodes, which does contain some G-rated adventures, while at the same time you learn a little history and geography lesson. Younger kids will like the two fun teenage detectives as they try to stop the legendary thief, while adults will like the educational aspects of the series. Overall, I enjoyed the DVD and I recommend it to others.",1337731200,4,1857,4.5148809523809526
