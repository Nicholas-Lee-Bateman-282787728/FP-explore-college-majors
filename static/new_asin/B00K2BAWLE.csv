8655248,4,B00K2BAWLE,"I liked it even though it wasn't as good as I was thinking it would be. The subtitles were good from start to end and it was a bit ""bloody"" but still good to watch.",1479168000,,164,3.7142857142857144
8655249,2,B00K2BAWLE,"The plot is good. Yet, there where quite a bit of flaws in this show. The ending is morally incorrect. I enjoy watching action packed shows, and I typically don't mind blood. I've watched the Man from Nowhere which is rated R, and I looked it. But this show is beyond rated R, It's crazy with its violence, blood and morals, and there is no hope at the end that anything will get better. I have it two starts for the plot.",1436227200,,422,4.158536585365853
8655250,5,B00K2BAWLE,I took a chance on buying this movie since I didn't have a lot to go on in regards to the plot. I have to say this movie was so worth it. I have watched this movie twice in only 3 days since its arrived and I will be watching it again soon. The characters are very well done and the plot is very well written. All the actors did an amazing job but Yeo Jin-Goo (Hwayi) brought the most in this performance. His ability to show such emotion at such a young age is truly amazing. I have seen several shows with Jin-Goo ( Iljimae and I miss you) but this is by far his best yet. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.,1432598400,,623,3.9523809523809526

8655253,5,B00K2BAWLE,"I am not gonna lie, I watch this movie about once a week.  Hwayi is a character that appeals on many levels, the plot was formed well and the acting was top notch.  It is a dark movie that even made me cry when empathizing with the main character.",1417478400,,247,4.020408163265306
