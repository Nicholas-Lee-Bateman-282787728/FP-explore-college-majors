292594,5,6300270912,"""After Hours"" is probably my favourite movie of all time.  It's one of the most original movies I've ever seen.  All of the performances are incredible, Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Catherine O'Hara, Teri Garr, you're all brilliant in this film!!!!!  This is one of the few movies out there that's both sickly comic, and disturbing.  ""After Hours"" somehow makes you feel like you're going through all the sh** Griffin Dunne is experiencing.  I think the reason this movie is so good is because we the viewer in some way connect with Griffin's character.  I'm sure we've all had one of those ""bad days"", where the world seems like it's working against you.  Martin Scorcese brilliantly directs this work of art, taking us into the underbelly of nightlife and all it's starkness and mystery.",932601600,4,793,4.917293233082707

292675,5,6300270912,"This was directed by Martin Scorsese and has quite a ensemble of actors which includes Cheech and Chong, Roseanna Arquette, Teri Garr,
a bunch of other people and Griffin Dunne [who I didn't know] in the lead role as Paul Hackett, a guy with a boring programming job in NYC
who dreams of starting a magazine for aspiring writers.

Scorsese struck on this in a period of gloom. He had been working on a big and serious movie, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", but ended
up in such a disagreement with the studio over budget that he set aside the film, after putting a lot of energy into it. No doubt the studio feared it was going to be a loser. So Scorsese decided to look toward smaller, independent producers and a smaller-budget film. He struck on this script, which Tim Burton was interested in directing, but as soon as Scorsese said he'd like to do it,  Burton immediately bowed out.

Thisapparently startedas a long stand-up monologue by an actor named Joe Frank. From there, it was converted into a film script by Joseph Minion, aptly titled, ""A Night in Soho"". Scorsese made a few more alterations including the final title, ""After Hours"".  This was the first fiction work byScorsese in a decade which did NOT use Robert De Niro as an actor. Interesting factoid.

Audiences were underwhelmed and it only grossed about $10 million on release. Critics were impressed. Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 5 stars and commented that it was one of the best films of the year, and demonstrated Scorsese's combining of ""comedy, satire, unrelenting pressure and a pervasive feeling of paranoia."" Scorsese actually got ""best director"" at Cannes Film Festival for this, and it has a very strong rating of 90% positive on Rotten Tomatoes. It became something of a cult classic.

Although it was made in 1985, it makes heavy use of pop tunes circa1950'sor so, all of which are incongruously happy and romantic.

The story is so peculiar that in some respects it resembles a dream--one of those disturbing but not-exactly-nightmare dreams that you'd like to wake up from, but just go on and on, and you'restuck trying to resolve the same unresolvable situation.

Paul Hackett, the young programmer with grandiose dreams, leaves work and stops at a nondescript, almost empty diner for something to eat. There he meets a rather attractive blonde [Arquette] who chats with him about the book he's reading [Tropic of Cancer] and comes up with a reason
to give him her telephone number. Returning to his apartment, alone, he calls her up and she invites him to stop over at the apartment she's sharing with a female friend, a sculptor. He hops in a cab and his""nightmare"" begins.

Everything imaginable goes wrong, in rather hilarious ways, but this acting is all done very straight-faced. There is no slapstick about the humor here. It falls into the genre of ""black humor"".  Totryto go into the plot at all would sort of spoilviewing it.  He stumbles from one bizarre situation into another, and though at first they all seem unrelated, gradually we see that actually they all ARE related, in some way or another.

One scene, in which Hackett is arguing with a bouncerabout why he can't be let into a nightclub, was inserted by Scorsese based on a scene from Franz Kafka's ""The Trial"", a great literary classic of deeply dark comedy. That scene involved the protagonist's interminable wait for proceedings to actually begin. Scorsese inserted it here as a memo about his interminable struggle with Paramount over ""Last Temptation of Christ"", and it fits
perfectly into this story line too.

Additional fun fact: Scorsese inserts himself into the film too,in a bit part (the way Hitchcock and I think Tarentino often do).

My inclination while I was watching it was to wonder why I was sticking with it, but I could not resist finding out how this thing was going to end. When it finally ended I had to admit it was one of the more interesting films I've seen recently. I give it an A-.",1490140800,5,3970,4.743105950653121
292676,5,6300270912,"My copy of After Hours arrived on time and in perfect condition, so I was very pleased with the purchase. The movie is pretty low-key compared to much of Scorsese's other work, at least in terms of action and ethics. It lacks themes of violence (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, etc.) or morality (The Last Temptation of Christ, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, some already mentioned, etc.) found in many of his other works and instead focuses on black comedy primarily through the use of irony, symbolism, and metaphor. Stylistically, it feels more in line with his work on The King of Comedy. Altogether, it's a fun, random ride that's perfect as an add-on item.",1490054400,,704,4.8264462809917354

292876,5,6300270912,"Martin Scorcese's nihilistic comedy follows the desperate adventures of Paul Hackett, a mid-level word processor at a company in New York one night lost in the Soho art district of New York.

Bored and alone one Friday Night, Paul Hackett takes his copy of Tropic of Cancer and sets out to a local coffee shop because there's nothing on cable and it beats being alone at home. While there he meets a beautiful, vaguely mysterious woman named Marcy who lures him to her friend's loft with the promise of a Plaster of Paris Bagel and Cream Cheese paperweight.  And this is where it all starts to go horribly wrong.

Over the brief span of the evening, he'll find himself wrongly accused in a string of burglaries, menaced by art house thugs, and pursued by a gang of neighborhood vigilantes, thanks to the machinations of a spurned fugitive from the 60's who happens to work part time at a copy shop. At his lowest moment, hiding from the vigilantes, crouching on a fire escape, he witnesses a woman shoot her abusive lover to death, and can only deadpan, ""I'll probably get blamed for that.""

Set against the dark urban landscape of Soho, Scorsese's comedy is part noir thriller, part existential nightmare, wherein the hapless hero finds himself lost and trapped in a landscape so foreign, yet so maddeningly close to home. Paul Hackett is a nice guy who finds himself at odds with the city and an apparently absent or uncaring God, causing him to cry out in his frustration ""What do you want from me?  I'm just a word processor!""

The film features a truly stand out performance by Griffin Dunne as Paul Hackett, and Rosanna Arquette as the seductive yet vulnerable Marcy. Also look for Linda Fiorentino in an early role along with Will Patton at his absolute toughest, and a delightful appearance by Cheech and Chong as well as New York staple Rockets Redglare.

This is the ideal comedy for anyone who's ever had one of those days when nothing went right. The joy and delight of this film is watching Paul Hackett almost make it home so many times, only for things to get worse as he navigates this cityscape of intertwining characters. This film is delightfully harrowing and brings the viewer a much needed sense of Schadenfreude.",1419984000,3,2235,4.70076726342711

292893,4,6300270912,"This movie ran on cable back in the 1990's as I recall.  The version I saw must have been a rare director's cut, because I remember it being longer, with more scenes that support character Paul Hackett's desperation to get home.  I looked at IMDB for more information and see that the original cut was 45 minutes longer.  I don't recall the version I saw being 2 hrs 22 minutes, but it seemed longer than this version.  I think this short edit, maybe intended to make it fit a 2 hour TV time slot, has resulted in some of Scorsese's fine work being left on the editing room floor!

The movie has many hilariously funny scenes along with some sad and even somewhat grim moments as Dunne wanders through a surreal late-night urban environment, meeting various eccentric characters. His descent from normal working Joe to hunted criminal over the course of the picture is enlivened by a who's who of Hollywood stars.

292947,2,6300270912,"Plot: Supposed straight laced NYC computer office guy runs into a troubled girl one evening. She introduces him to her troubles and more all in one night.

Comments: The subject line sums this movie up for me. It tried to be an Adventures in Babysitting/Ferris Bueller's Day Off/Gotcha type of adventure movie for the main character with an adult theme. But it had a weird, dark, disturbing theme. It was full of the underground. It went way beyond adult-themed and was not entertaining but just left you feeling like you lived in a creepy world. Every character was a weirdo from the S&M to the mentally disturbed to the suicidal to the leather gays to murderers. And they were portrayed in a way that made them seem normal. But Griffen Dunn was cast as the sudo-weirdo, out of place guy. As a matter of fact after you are introduced to all the events you are led to subtly believe he is a heartless monster for what he does to the girl he meets and what she does before the night is over--kinda like he wasn't there for her and just ""judged"" her as a weirdo when her problems were actually pretty normal. Anyway, Dunn's character was supposed to be the ""straight laced"" guy but yet he follows a creepy weird girl and her mysterious prescription creme home to sleep with her. So without the subtext that is forced on you by the creators of this movie, in my mind, he was a creep for a totally different reason--only creeps and weirdos would do want to or try to sleep with such a person. So you can't even relate to the main character.  After following the plot for a while I began to get bored and started hoping it was ending soon. It seemed to linger. It wasn't boring in the fact that there wasn't a new weirdo doing something weird at the next turn. It was just boring in that I was getting tired of the creepy movie and all its twists and turns as it weaved all these characters into the same plot line. It was only supposed to have taken place during the 8 hours someone is supposed to be in bed asleep. The only reason I gave this movie two stars and not one is because the story line tied up all loose ends. . . albeit in a knot.",1373155200,,2139,4.305210918114144

292978,5,6300270912,"In the mid 80's Scorsese was in a dark place. Filming of The King of Comedy turned into a marathon, and he was starting to lose the joy of making films he knew from his days as a student filmmaker. Couple that with the fact that his passion project, The Last Temptation of Christ, was imploding under the weight of budget and time constraints until it was finally cancelled. Scorsese fell into depression and began pondering the possible end to his career, while searching for a project to re-find his love of crafting film.

In After Hours he found a project that he felt he could channel his depression into, and could possibly serve to help restore his former joy of filmmaking. After Hours was being developed as a Tim Burton vehicle at the time (he was hired based on the strength of his short film Vincent). After hearing that the script was initially sent to Scorsese, and that he was now interested in directing, Burton respectfully declined the director's chair not wanting to get in the way of Scorsese. Going into the film, Scorsese felt that if he could not finish this film properly he would never make another film again.

Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is nothing more than an average word processor. One night after work he runs into a woman named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) who invites him to her friend's place in Soho for a date. After spending some time with her, though, he realizes that she's a bit more than he can take so he makes a run for it when she's in the room. Unfortunately (or fortunately for us) he finds himself on the streets of Soho with no money and things quickly spiral further out of control as he contends with eccentric locals, mobs mistaking him for a burglar, and a suicide he may have caused.

Scorsese isn't known as a director of comedy, but here he proves that he has a special flourish for it. As most of his films will attest to, Scorsese feels most at home when in his native New York. Here he borrows liberally from Hitchcock ramping up the tension and suspense throughout the film. Just watching the manic energy of the film you can tell that Scorsese was reinvigorated by the opportunity to make a film that steps away from his usual film type.

The casting doesn't skimp on a cast that can easily bring the funny. Included in the cast are Christopher Guest regular Catherine O'Hara as well as Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. While this is a comedy, the comedy is treated with a wry wit. Every situation is treated as a serious life or death situation rather than posting huge signs pointing out where the comedy is supposed to be like you see in a lot of modern comedy. At one point Paul witnesses a wife murder her husband and mutters to himself, completely deadpan, ""I'm probably going to get blamed for that.""

The real key to making this work, though, is Griffin Dunne. Employing some method acting to improve his reactions, Dunne gives a brilliant performance. He draws the viewer into his performance, making you feel for him while you also simultaneously laugh at his expense. At one point to capture the right reaction walking into an empty club, he walked a couple blocks to a bar, ordered a drink for everyone at the bar, and ran out when the bartender asked for the money. He ran the entire two blocks to the set and Scorsese started the cameras the moment he stepped on the set. (For full disclosure, Dunne did go back and pay the bar.)

In the end, After Hours was critically acclaimed, Scorsese won the Best Director award at Cannes, it doubled its budget in box office revenue, and in 1988 he was finally able to make and release The Last Temptation of Christ. This is one of Scorsese's lesser known films, achieving more of a cult status, but that doesn't mean it's one of his worst films. I highly recommend that you give this a try if you haven't seen it already. It's a fun romp through the city, with a touch of danger and suspense that easily ranks up with the best of Scorsese's canon.

A working class schmuck meets a girl, follows her, gets creeped out by her, runs as far away from her as he can, meets another girl, gets weirded out by her, runs the other way, meets another girl, well you get the picture.  And of course he's lost his money out the taxi window.  This must be the longest night of his life.  Each time he thinks he's about to catch a break and get back home before daylight to catch some winks before another grinding day at the office something and/or someone undermines him.  There's also an odd thread of burn scars and burning throughout that adds to the disequilibrium.  The humor is twisted but a relief; you almost feel bad for laughing but can't help yourself.  I loved the so, so young performances by John Heard, Rosanna Arquette, Cheech Marin and especially Teri Garr.  There's even a cameo of a young Scorsese!  The way Scorsese dressed and filmed Arquette's character seemed like a parody of Hitchcock's Grace Kelly character in Rear Window with the added creep factor of how tweaked Arquett's Marcie was.  For instance at 2 something in the morning, at a deserted dinner she tells the main protagonist, played incredibly well by Griffin Dunne, how her estranged husband was fixated on ""The Wizard of Oz"" to the point he'd call out `surrender Dorothy' during intimate moments.

292994,5,6300270912,"Martan Scorcesse made After Hours when he was being bullied by fundimentalist goons, trying to get Last Temptation of Christ produced. Can't bring a project off, find another project. It is what the best artists do.

And this film is the opposite of Last Temptation: small, indie tinged and wickedly funny. A nice, average updown New Yorker goes down to Soho to try and get a little action.

When your money goes out the window on the cab ride downtown, it is probably time to go back uptown, have a beer and go to sleep. Our hero does not realize this, and very very few of us would.

And when your first date starts to cry and her roomate goes topless in front of you, yeah, you get the hint. By then, the subway fare goes up and you realize you are in deep trouble.

I won't reveal more but one certianty: we have all days when we should have just stayed in bed with Law and Order and coco. But we troup on and random microdisasters just seem to pop from our normal routine, but by this time, it is too late to go home.

Beyond the great editing and production values and humor which could only be Martin, here is the great part. After the loons of Taxi Driver and King Of Comady, After Hours is Scorcesse dealing with a common guy, having a really, really bad night. Over the top, sure, but something we can all connect with. We have probably all had a day like this, on a smaller scale, in the past few weeks.

The sequence of events is far fetched but with After Hours, that is the point. It makes the film funnier, and the events more immediate.

And I'll tell you, after some of the days I have had, I beleive every frame is entirely plausable.",1258761600,,1652,4.258785942492013
292995,5,6300270912,"I really liked this film.  However, I am a little surprised at the depth of love for this film - many other reviewers on this site say it's one of their favorite films, which I do not quite understand.  Yes, it was very unique, funny, and at times brilliant.  Having said that, it's not even close to Scorsese's better work on five or six other films.  Still, you would never know it's a Scorsese film if you hadn't been told and did not look at the film credits.  No gangsters, no wise-guy violence, no catholic guilt.

If you are looking for an off-beat comedy, this one is certainly heads and shoulders above the usual fare.  I just can't understand why it has become a cult classic.  I give it five stars because it makes other comedies seem lame by comparison, although on the Scorsese meter, it's not even in the top five.",1251244800,,828,4.401315789473684

I watched this movie twice, and found it to be one of those films that is very interesting the first time around, but not so cool on the second look when the thin story becomes more evident. Some movies are like that, mainly the ones which are wacky and the viewer is shocked at what he's seeing. When the shock wears off, it isn't so entertaining.

Let's stick to the first look: the film kept my attention because I kept wondering what crazy thing was going to happen next. It's hard to explain this story because its a combination of genres and an attempt at black humor. Be warned, too, on the first viewing: the first 25 minutes are slow, and then it picks up, so stick with it.",1247011200,6,783,4.430555555555555

A (very) black comedy, urban nightmare, and examination of Murphy's Law all rolled into one and directed with flair by Scorsese, After Hours is a very entertaining story of a man caught in SoHo late at night with no means of getting home; by never taking itself too seriously while simultaneously being serious enough to be scary, After Hours is an impressive film.",1234051200,2,383,4.803030303030303
293000,5,6300270912,"Perfect flawless black comedy with humor as dark as the night that caught Paul Hacket (Griffin Dunne), a nice guy, an everyman, an ordinary computer operator in its darkness and surrounded him by all kinds of weird strangers who very well could be the deadly creatures of night that inhabited SOHO of early 1980s every night after hours... or perhaps they are still there? If ever a brilliant film was made about a worst nightmare come true, After Hours it is. This movie seems so different from what we've come to associate with Martin Scorsese but it is undeniably his film. It takes place in NYC, and its dark scary streets come directly from Scorsese's earlier masterpieces, ""Mean Streets"" (the streets after hours are even meaner, are they not?) and ""Taxi Driver"", the horrifying descend to the real Inferno.

Amy Robinson, the film producer calls After Hours ""dark, funny, paranoid New York summer movie"" - and it says it all. This movie makes me think how great it would be if Scorsese turned to comedies (not the Hollywood brainless light romantic comedies but ""dark, funny, paranoid"" type) more often. I have to mention writing which is absolutely brilliant, considering that it was the first work by Joseph Minion. Roger Ebert, who recently has included After Hours to his list of Great movies, mentions that Minion's teacher, the Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavejev, gave the script an ""A."" Having seen Makavejev's infamous Sweet Movie, I am not at all surprised. I also want to mention the camera work by Michael Ballhaus, the German cinematographer who has made fabulous in their beauty films with Rainer Werner Fassbinder. It seems to me that Scorsese might have seen Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because both films share the claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere which was captured amazingly by Ballhaus. After their first work together on After Hours, Scorsese and Ballhause would make The Color of Money (1986), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Gangs of New York (2002), and The Departed (2006).

The journey through the worst night ever by Paul brought to mind another surreal journey, one of my all time favorites, ""O Lucky Man"" by Lindsay Anderson. After Hours is in the same league for me. In both films, the nice guys take a trip that would turn brutal, bizarre, dangerous yet irresistibly funny. Mick Travis wanted to succeed in life while Paul Hacket only wanted some fun night and perhaps to get close to a beautiful woman he'd met earlier (Rosanna Arquette). Instead, he would encounter a trio of mysterious and dangerous women who seduce, mystify, and horrify him (Linda Fiorentino, Terri Garr, and Catherine O'Hara). And I don't even mention all crazy male characters. After Hours does not get mentioned among Scorsese's most remarkable and memorable films but it is. Even if it takes place in the 80s, it is timeless; it does not lose any of its dark nocturnal power. It is a great work of the master who has been always passionate about cinema. Scorsese made After Hours when he was forced to stop working on ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and was depressed, frustrated, and uncertain if he would ever return to it. Scorsese told his friend Mary Pat Kelly. ""My idea then was to pull back, and not to become hysterical and try to kill people. So the trick then was to try to do something."" Scorsese later confessed that working on After Hours gave him back his love for making movies. The members of the jury in Cannes Festival were certainly mesmerized with Scorsese's inspiring directing. They awarded him with the Best Director Prize in 1986. If ever any director deserved it, it was Martin Scorsese for the marvel which After Hours is.

293001,2,6300270912,"I don't know whats up with William A Young, but he's being far too kind giving this five stars. This collection, like the Sex Starlets collection, is much of the same nonsense. Like I said for that one I'll say for this: WAAAYHAAAAYHAAAY OVERPRICED!

The movies in this package are just too much of a joke to be worth the money. None of them are that long for one. They feature few actors/actresses. Virgin Hostage features only three women: one of them is horribly ugly, one just appears briefly in the background, the only one you even get a decent performance out of is Susan Fields. [So I guess this movie's only good for fans of Susan Fields. May also be good for those who like dirty humor.]

Play only with me features only three people in the entire movie! Also short, we have one not so great looking female who is not much fun to look at performing. Then a better looking one who we see less of. Mostly a boring movie; may only be good for the gun scene.

The Blue Balloon is the biggest joke of all! IT FEATURES ONLY ONE ACTRESS! Can anyone believe that? Still... it can be enjoyable for those who like good bondage scenes.

All in all, I give this two stars because the price is a bit steep for what it offers. May be worth about $15. In fact all these grindhouse movies, considering their not so great quality in production, ought to not be over $20. I might have given this four stars if it were more appropriately priced.

293017,5,6300270912,"Martin Scorsese has, over time, given us so much.  From his earliest days to present.  Not that all his films were/are great, as were/are those of any other film directors of his era or any other.  The difference here is that in this film, Scorsese tackles comedy, which went and generally goes against his overall filmmaker grain.  This is his other main humorous masterpiece film, along with his black comedy ""King of Comedy,"" which as much or more than equals ""After Hours,"" but is much less black and nightmarish than this.  When it comes down to it, unlike King of Comedy (full of a subtle, more nervous humor), After Hours, while consistently providing numerous moments of laugh out loud craziness, is more of a nightmare comedy than a black one.  Especially upon repeated viewings.  Because hidden within this broad comedy are simply tons of individual scene oddities and unforgettable moments.  In short, this is King of Comedy gone Twilight Zone, but that's all a part of its charm and overall success.  While nothing seen approaches unreasonable ""yeah, right"" suspensions of disbelief, through Griffin Dunne's portrayal of ""Paul,"" a NYC word processor circa 80's green screen computer monitors, and pretty much a normal guy, the audience is from the first moments on, easily able to identify with him.  And that's the secret of this film's brilliance.

One night, bored with switching cable stations, he ventures out into the NYC night rather late, and on a ""school night"" (he has to work the next day), and while reading a worn novel in a late-night diner, is introduced to an attractive girl (Rosanna Arquette), Marcie.  It is a chance and strange meeting, but romance-hungry Paul eventually jumps at the chance to meet up with Marcie later in the ""after hours"" and soon finds his decision the beginning of a true comic-nightmare series of events, all unforseen.

Traveling down to the Soho district in the middle of the night, full of nuts like Teri Garr, Linda Fiorentino, among many others, for an everyman like Paul, his rash initial decision begins a series of more and more bizarre events and circumstances, and scene upon scene of absolute genius in their overall execution, timing, and meaning.  Throughout the film, virtually every scene and shot seems to belong and there is absolutely no filler of any kind here.

One of the most common nightmares of common folk consist of ""obstacles.""  Whereas one is trying to complete something, or get somewhere, or just end the at-times seemingly hopeless task at hand, to just wake up from the nightmare, back in your home, in your bed, and wake up.  Trouble is, for Paul, his strange journey extends throughout almost the entire length of the film, which makes this a true existential and metaphysical classic.

What's so great about this film is how it slowly goes from the absurd and nightmarish step by step, until by the end, Paul's everyday nightmare of his job is his wake up call, and the film comes full circle.  Full of memorable scenes and superb directorial touches, and lots of laughs, even if some may be just too close to home and reality to lay within the fully comfortable, ""After Hours"" is a movie that if you get into it within the first 20-30 minutes, you will stick with it till the end because the whole premise is just so edge-of-seat compelling.  It is also unique in the history of all great films in that nearly every shot and scene is just about perfect.

Scorsese throws in the kitchen sink here and proves his directorial genius at every twist and turn, utilizing various creative insider moments throughout.  Throughout, there is also a wonderful feeling of being stuck in some temporal hell, where some moments drag on and some are over in an instant.  Just like any such ""dream.""

This is a film to be viewed again and again, if for no other reason than to break down and understand the broader and quite deep implications of what is constantly entertaining and even enlightening, for very different reasons.  Paul (Griffin Dunne) is the center of the film, and the viewer's center as well, as we see the comic, nightmarish, series of improbable but very believable in a way happenings, through his perspective.  But that is more than enough, given the multitude of strange characters and situations he finds himself in, when all he really just wanted to do was ""maybe get out of his apartment for awhile, maybe meet a nice girl, and how he eventually seemed to have to DIE FOR IT???!!!""  One of many highlight moments of simply a great film.

There are so many such moments, they are impossible to go into but another of my faves is Paul, in the middle of a NYC Soho neighborhood dark night ""after hours"" street, falling to his knees in a prayer to God with the line, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, I'M JUST A WORD PROCESSOR!!!""  Darkly, nervously, right on and laugh out loud funny.  And look fast for Scorcese appearing ala-Hitchcock in the film as the guy shining the spotlights from above in the punk rock club scene, on Soho ""Mohawk"" night.

By all means, one of Scorsese's best, like his ""King Of Comedy"", not to be missed by any true black/nightmare comedy film fan from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  If you like/love this, you'll love ""King of Comedy"" and vica versa.

Cheech and Chong's last major film as a team.  Teri Garr and the rat trap surrounded bedroom.  Surrender Dorothy!  So many moments, so little time.  A dark comic gem from beginning to end.",1203120000,2,5472,4.740232312565998
293018,4,6300270912,"A witty yuppy nightmare black comedy from Martin Scorsese - surely not, but its true. Griffin Dunne stars as Paul Hackett an office worker who is bored beyond belief. Look out for the mid 1980's computers, remember green text on black screens! Much later in the evening he meets a girl in a diner where he is drinking coffee and from there his night spirals out of control.

This is frequently funny and the cast are all good. Rossana Arquette, Linda Fiorentino and Teri Carr play the main female roles (although there are others) and they are the reason Griffin Dunne's character Paul loses control of his night out 'after hours'.

As you'd expect this is well directed by Scorsese and the only comedy he has made to date. Its a concise (93 mins) film that doesn't overstay its welcome. Sadly it doesn't seem to be available to buy separately at the moment, but it is part of the Martin Scorsese boxed set. At the right price this is worth getting.",1194652800,,949,4.543859649122807
293019,4,6300270912,"What happens to others when our eyes close at night?  Does a city really sleep, or are there adventures to be had even after the latest bar closes?  New York City is one of those towns (if that word can be used) where a happy citizen could meet random strangers who are have equally fun nights, connect with hijinks throughout, and finally return back after this sed night to report around the water cooler with co-workers the next day.  New York City - a hell of a town.  When NYC turns its lights off at night; that is when famed director Martin (or Marty) Scorsese decides comedy would ensue.  When ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" fell through, Marty needed a project to lift his spirits, make him laugh, bring back his respect for filmmaking, and put his dream project behind him for now - so he decided to jump headfirst into ""After Hours"".  This is a small, probably unseen gem which demonstrates quite a bit of talent, some humorous moments, but mainly soul, rhythm, and excitement.  ""After Hours"" was a surprise, because I think I had heard a joke about Scorsese and comedy, but he pulled this one through, providing classic cinematography, that darkened edge that was enjoyed in ""Bringing out the Dead"", and a solid character to lead us through the night.  ""After Hours"" gave Marty the inspiration he needed to continue to make films, and it is a little gem he should never be afraid of.

This film takes place during the course of one night.  As a series of unfortunate events happen to our lead, Griffin Dunne, we watch as he encounters bar keeps, ice cream truck drivers, papier-mch bagels, 50s-style waitresses, Cheech and Chong, Mohawks, and finally an aging woman at a bar who also loves, you guessed it, papier-mch.  While it seems like the night comes full circle, the events that occur during the 97-minutes are pure entertainment as well as pure Scorsese.  From an acting standpoint, only one character needed to be developed enough to enjoy.  Dunne is reminiscent of a young Gene Wilder in this role with his passionate rants and witty retorts.  Dunne is also easy to follow through this journey, as he is the quintessential ""joe-shmoe"" with the go-nowhere job looking for a night on the town.  As he gets wet, hit, excited, and nervous, the audience can relate to him.  He is perfect for this role, and his mannerisms fit with his character.  Those surrounding Dunne also create their own ""oddities"" of the city.  Rosanna Arquette is mesmerizing as a woman with potential burns and non-cohesive tendencies.  We never know if she is the truth or instigator of this evening.  Linda Fiorentino is decent, but John Heard punches in the laughter, as does Teri Garr and Catherine O'Hara.  The cameo by Cheech and Chong may date this film, but it added to the inconsistent chaos that transformed ""After Hours"" from mediocre intertwined story, to independent cult classic.

Outside of the quirky characters that Scorsese has ideally placed throughout this film, the cinematography also is an element to enjoy with this film.  Scorsese doesn't just sit back and film with generic stock footage; he uses his patented techniques to give us his own signature film.  The scene with the keys was impressive (as well as added to the overall oddities of Dunne) as well as the scene near the end where Scorsese takes us around Dunne's office in a swooping visual treat.  These are two to watch, but also look at the smaller moments.  Scorsese proves in this film that he can handle singular shots as well as full-framed moments with hordes of people.  His talent behind the camera isn't wasted or misused; he takes what could have been an average zany night out using Hollywood recycling, and transforms it into a Scorsese picture worthy of his repertoire.  Let us not be mistaken, this is a Martin Scorsese picture, and one should not neglect it when mentioning the others in his award winning portfolio.  Scorsese isn't known for his comedy style, but with both this and ""Bringing out the Dead"", he really creates his own type of comedy and dives headfirst into the darker element of the trade.

On a very small note, Scorsese's use of mythology is slight, but intensely focused in ""After Hours"".  The fact that this entire evening happens with the dropping of a set of keys, the opening of a large gate, like a boy heading into manhood or to his first adventure is enjoyable.  This film was the study of a man entering life, going from death (the working at a dead-end job) to a life full of adventure on the streets (perhaps not paying the river-man the right amount due to him driving too quickly and his $20 flying out the window), and finally back into death (the swooping final scene) is highly symbolical of the circle of life.  Only Marty could give us this deeper meaning on a comedy.  ""After Hours"" is a perfect pairing with ""Bringing out the Dead"" with its focuses on life versus death.  A side note, but well worth mentioning.

Overall, this was a welcomed surprise.  I wasn't familiar with Scorsese's ""After Hours"", but it was obviously his film with signature cinematography, apparent cameos, and dedicated characters.  This feature has just as much heart, soul, and energy as any ""Mean Streats"", ""Goodfellas"", or ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", and honestly should be credited with giving Mr. Scorsese the inspiration to keep working.  Without ""After Hours"", our cinematic theaters would never have known Christ's final thoughts.  If you are looking for a comedy, a late night snack, or a great project for your final film class, this is the perfect film to use.  It is often overlooked, but should be catapulted into cult classic status.  It had everything from monumental lines (who can't laugh at the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel?), amazing scenes, and characters that kept you glued to the screen.  Watch it.  I promise a great night out exploring the lonely streets of New York - that side we never see because it is ... ""After Hours"".

293022,4,6300270912,"""After Hours"" is an anomaly among the works of Martin Scorsese. That's because it's a comedy, albeit one of the darkest variety. After Hours concerns the worst night of ordinary word processor Paul Hackett's life. Hackett, played by ""An American Werewolf in London""'s Griffin Dunne, meets a woman at a cafe in New York one evening. She gives him her phone number, and that night at 11:30 Hackett gives her a ring. The woman (Rosanna Arquette) asks him to come over, and naturally he complies.

But he gets more than he bargained for. By the end of that night (if he lives to see it), Hackett will have been responsible for one suicide, drawn the attention of a number of bizarre women including ""Miss Beehive 1965"" (Teri Garr), an artist with kinky tastes (Linda Fiorentino), and an obnoxious ice cream vendor (Catherine O'Hara), been chased by an angry and determined mob looking for blood, and wind up being ""stolen"" by two thieves (Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong) while encased in papier-mache. Early on in the film, Paul apologizes to someone: ""Boy, I'm sorry. I guess I've really been runnin' you through the mill tonight."" Paul has no idea that he's about to get run through the mill himself, and experience more in one incredible night than most people would in their entire lives.

""After Hours"" is a great concept, turned into a stellar script by Joseph Minion. But it's the massive talent of director Scorsese and a delightful cast that turn that stellar script into a stellar movie. It's ironic that one of Scorsese's lesser-known projects (by which I mean one which doesn't rank among the annals of the greatest films ever made), a comedy, no less, features some of his best work. Scorsese directs the picture with the flowing skill of Alfred Hitchcock; if Hitchcock himself directed a modern comedy, it would no doubt turn out like this. Scorsese is obviously very amused by what's going on here. He transforms the amusing into the hilarious by making the many absurd turns of the film as plausible as possible. At the same time, he turns this night into a nightmare. SoHo becomes like the forests of Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies, an ominous, claustrophobic, inescapable force. All the forces of nature seem to be against poor Paul Hackett.

Paul is an impressively fascinating character as rendered by Griffin Dunne. There's just the slightest air of eccentricity about Dunne's performance; otherwise, Paul Hackett seems like an ordinary guy, one with good intentions at that, and therein lies the appeal of the character. He's not some jerk who deserves all this tumult; he's a nice guy who's having an inconceivably horrid night and just can't get home. As such, the audience sympathizes, and rather than just sitting back and laughing at this poor sap, we're drawn into his plight to get home. At the end of it all, we hope he does.

The supporting cast is very strong. Their characterizations are simply wonderful. Thanks to Scorsese, they're believable people, but they're also very, very odd. It's clear that Paul is completely on his own, further accenting the nightmarishness of it all. Even when he finds a friend in sweet bartender Tom (John Heard), fate intervenes. Particularly interesting is Marcy, Rosanna Arquette's character, who initially draws Paul into Soho. After doing some snooping around her bags, Paul discovers a tube of cream for severe burns, and beside that a book designed to help burn victims recover. He gets a little frightened, and we wonder just what Marcy's hiding. Later, Paul looks over Marcy's naked body and discovers no sign of any burns whatsoever. More Hitchcockian moments, courtesy of Mr. Scorsese.

""After Hours"" has stalwart photography by Michael Ballhaus. A number of shots are pretty as a picture. The way it's filmed, with Scorsese's pitch-black approach to the material, has a faint noirishness about it. Yet although ""After Hours"" would fit in well with Scorsese's other dark portraits of life in the Big Apple, there's nothing in the film to suggest Martin Scorsese had a hand in its making. Surprisingly, considering the un-Scorsese-like material, Scorsese's hand is deep in the project. Likely he identified with his protagonist. Scorsese's most personal project, an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" had just been abruptly cancelled a mere four days before filming was scheduled to begin, so it's understandable that Scorsese should feel that, like Paul Hackett, his life was out of his control and in the hands of others. (Scorsese finally made ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" three years later.)

""After Hours"" doesn't deserve a spot among pictures like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" or ""Taxi Driver,"" but it deserves a lot more appreciation than it gets. It's a Scorsese masterwork, albeit of a very different variety than his usual works. Like the night depicted in the film, ""After Hours"" ends eventually. Anyone who appreciates film will be wishing it didn't.",1185580800,,4972,5.006045949214027
293023,5,6300270912,"'After Hours' has to be one of the great classics in film.  Martin Scorsese reinvents the directing wheel once again in 1985 for one of the darkest comedies in memory.

Paul (relatively unknown Griffin Dunne) is an anonymous everyman working at a New York office with cubicles and computers.  Late at night in a cafe he meets a beautiful, but strange woman (Rosanna Arguette) who captivates him immediately.  Demonstrating a scatter-brained conversation, they agree for him to meet her roommate who makes paper mache' paper weight bagels.  Connecting with an interest in the novel he's reading, she seems vibrant if not suspiciously dysfunctional, but her zestful overture creates for him the spark of adventure.

Showcasing the city that never sleeps, he solidifies his date over the phone to venture over to the SoHo District.  As a bad omen his cab ride from hell yields a placed twenty dollar bill that flies out of the cab onto the pavement.  Trying to explain to the driver who only speaks in broken English, the man wrathfully drives out like a chariot out of Hades leaving him stranded with no resources but himself alone in the night.

At the apartment, he visits with the artist as she puts paper mache' on a figure he aptly, but inaccurately compares to Munch's ""The Shriek"" (""The Scream"")  From there he meets up with his bombshell date who immediately unveils her life in horrifying detail.  Between the revealing creation in the living room and the woman's conversation of her horrible life, the rest of the night unravels even more from there.  Featuring everything that could conceivably go wrong and camera angles that swirl around the beleaguered protagonist, the solitary agony of one man's night comes to roost in the most tightly woven existential nightmare probably ever conceived in comedy.

While 'After Hours' doesn't get all the accolades of great movies like 'Taxi' and 'Raging Bull,' it nevertheless, broadens the scope of an unarguably talented director.  'After Hours' may not be Scorsese's best, but it certainly is my favorite of all of his works.",1182988800,,2079,4.988405797101449
293024,4,6300270912,"On one level, this movie looks like an oddity amongst the other films made by Martin Scorsese.  It's a somewhat absurd dark comedy from the eighties that has more in common with a cult classic like ""Something Wild"" than it does with ""Raging Bull.""  Supposedly, Tim Burton was originally slated to direct the film but stepped aside when Scorsese showed interest.

When you think about it, it's not that surprising that Scorsese would pick this film.  Like Woody Allen and Spike Lee, a lot of his films are about New York.  ""Mean Streets,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Age of Innocence,"" and ""Gangs of New York,"" are all about the city, at least in a way, and so is ""After Hours,"" which is set in SoHo, just a couple of miles from Wall Street, but a world away.

The story here is about a guy who hates his job.  One evening he meets a girl in a coffee shop.  He gets her number and calls her back the same night and they decide to meet up, even though it's almost midnight.  On the way there, the guy loses all his money and when his date turns into a disaster he spend the rest of the evening trying to get home and getting himself into one ridiculous situation after another.

This movie is a bit dated, so it may be hard to appreciate the first time through, although you can certainly get a laugh out of seeing some well-known actors in different roles (Rosanna Arquette, Catherine O'hara, Linda Fiorentino, Terri Garr, Cheech and Chong.)  As with most cult comedies, I think the pleasure from this one probably comes with repeated viewings as you start to notice the little things about the film.

293028,3,6300270912,"The aspect ratio is fake.

The top and bottom of the regular full screen version has been cropped out of the picture to give the illusion your getting a widescreen - what your getting is less picture!

The studios should label the DVD's as they did when they cropped VHS video picture "" this film has been modified to fit you tv screen"" as in modified to fit a 16x9 tv in this case.

You have already lost one third of the picture when it was modified to full screen, now you loose an additional one third to one fourth of the movies image!

The reason leterbox and widescreen has a demand, is that the audience or consumer wants to view the Movie as it was filmed and framed by the filmaker, and not loose out on portions of the movie that the director intended.

In other words the idea to release in widescreen was for the intention of showing MORE not LESS of the movies image.

The studios believe they can get away with this, since the average buyer does not have a full screen video version to compare with, or the consumer is just unaware.

I compared this DVD to a full screen VHS version, and in many cases where some DVD's come with both Full & Wide Screen on a flip disc, compare them before watching, many of the widesreen sides are just chopped versions of the full screen.

293029,5,6300270912,"I remember seeing this movie back in late 1985 when I was living in Florida.  There were perhaps 10-12 people in the audience.  I laughed until I couldn't breathe - there is such great use of irony in this film.  I went back a few days later to see it again, and took a friend who also would appreciate this movie - we were the only two in the theatre.  We laughed until we were oxygen-deprived.

Fast forward to late 80's /early 90's when I was lucky enough to find this movie on VHS - I turned SO many people on to this movie, it was unbelievable.  By this time however, the movie was no longer available.

This cult-like film was directed [flawlessly] by Martin Scorsese.  Basically, a working stiff by the name of Paul Hackett [Griffin Dunne in a role not many could have pulled off] leads a boring life of just working and going home.  While reading a dog-eared copy of a Henry Miller novel in an all night diner, he is coaxed into a conversation by a strange girl [Roseanne Arquette in another role not many could have pulled off].  She winds up giving him her number, which he goes home and calls immediately, and she says 'Maybe you should come over now'.  Being what amounts to the only social invitation on this man's calendar, he goes over that night to her loft in Soho.

So starts the worst evening of his life.  I won't go into detail, but basically EVERYTHING goes wrong, from the cab ride over there, on to the end of the movie.  Every interaction with the citizens in SoHo is hysterical, from this girls roommate, to her roommates boyfriend, to a bartender, to a freaky punk club, to a wacky waitress [another incredible character played by Teri Garr], two thieves [Cheech & Chong].  The journey of this one single night of an attempted date becomes so surreal, you can do nothing more than groan and laugh.  It is a very dark comedy, but a comedy nonetheless.  Look for Martin Scorsese's little cameo as the spotlight holder in the scene taking place in the nightclub ""Berlin"".  Griffin Dunne was just incredible in this movie, as were Roseanne Arquette and Teri Garr.  Also deserving credit was Linda Fiorentino as Roseanne Arquette's roommate in the loft.  Sometimes the dialogue is so low, you really have to concentrate, but that makes a lot of it that much more out there and funny.

I love this movie to death and it is a valued part of my DVD library.  This is one of those movies you will be turning friends onto again and again and recruiting new 'fans' every time you show it to someone who appreciates this genre and has not seen it.

Griffin Dunne is one my favourite actors, although he can overact at times. He is plays the frantic all around ""nice guy"" really well in this film. He is clearly out of his element in the wacky artsy Soho area of New York. Nobody makes any sense, especially the women, who are all lunatics. Either Scorcese or Minion is making a statement about the tendency of women to be eratic and overly emotional, I'm not sure. Scorcese comments that he hated living in downtown New York cause he just wanted ""go into a building and press a button for an elevator"".

Which brings me to the commentary. If you are thinking of getting this (or renting it) for the commentary, save your money, the commentary is horrible and consists mostly of the cinematographer, who I'm sure is a nice guy but he bored me silly, not enough Dunne of Scorcese, we just get endless minutes of this yutz droning on about different shots in excrutiating detail. Anyway, I'll save you trouble, basically the jist of the commentary was that Scorcese was making Last Temptation of Christ and the project got dumped, so he chose this movie because of the tight schedule. They shot the film very quickly and it comes through because there is definitely a sense of urgency that permeates it.

The end product is one of Scorcese's greatest and it is actually multi layered, with many allusions to the Wizard of Oz (trying to get home) and flames/fire (being trapped in Hell). The way all the plot elements tie together is quite clever, something you don't see in todays films, it's all paint by numbers.

Anyway, if you liked this film, check out ""Search and Destroy"" also with Dunne being even more manic and over the top. It also has Dennis Hopper, John Turturo and Christopher Walken. A must see!",1115769600,5,1890,4.585798816568047

293048,5,6300270912,"...just finished watching (on this,  the last day of

my 4-day President's Day weekend), one of the funniest

side-splitting films I have ever seen.  I waited so

long for it come out on DVD and received it from

Amazon.com last week.

""After Hours"" is the story of a guy who leaves work on

a normal day, and the events that transpire from 5

p.m. to 7 a.m.  When I first saw it some 15 years ago,

I was rolling in laughter.  This afternoon the

laughter grew to tears.  I loved every moment even

more so than the first time around.

Director Martin Scorsese is at his best with this gem.

 It went straight to my funny bone, only because it

follows a lifeline so similar to mine.  Griffin Dunne

is the star...and what a superb job he does.  But the

supporting cast is priceless.  Add to Griffin's role

as the poor soul who should have never gone to the

diner to read ""Tropic of Cancer"", a supporting cast of

 Rosanna Arquette, Teri Garr, Linda Fiorentino, John

Heard, ""Cheech"" Marin, and Verna Bloom, you have

created a masterpiece.  And what makes this so much

more masterful is the fact that Griffin Dunne plays

the role of Paul Hackett...that's right...""PAUL"".

What happens to Paul ""after hours"" is so tragic and

comical (and the way it unfolds is a credit to the

screenwriters), it is simply unforgettable...unless

you are me.  This film mirrors my life.  It has all of

the friends, lovers and ""influences"" that have made me

what I am today...nothing to boast about but

everything to laugh about.  It reminds me of so many

of the crazy women I have dated (or married)...the

insane friends I've endured (some of you are reading

this now), but most importantly it is a snapshot of

life...reality...relationships...and the way we handle

influences that come into our lives.  Poor Paul is put

on the brink of insanity (in only one night)...a film

that has stood the test of time...a film that reminds

me so much of ""ME""....and maybe ""YOU"".

Compounded by a classic soundtrack which includes such

songs as ""One Summer Night"", ""Angel Baby"", Mozart

concerto's....AND....""Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There

Is?""..this one is priceless.

And may I also add, that I'm a Rosanna Arquette

admirer.  Though she only survives the first 20

minutes of the film, she is a genuine actress that

deserves to be recognized by the Academy.  I will

never forget her in the classic made-for-cable film,

""The Wrong Man"", and her inspiring role as a medium in

""Black Rainbow"".  And Teri Garr is right there, too.

She portrays ""Miss Beehive, 1965""...hilarious!  Both

remind me so much of past loves.  Enough of that!

""After Hours"" gets a solid ""10"" in the comedy genre'.

It is not a film you want to see with commercials.

Everything is so tightly woven together, you must

watch it uninterrupted.

From lovely Marcie, to Kiki ""Kinky"" Bridges...Cheech

and Chong...and all the crazy people that seem so

normal in this flick...so real in our lives...this one

is a must.  If it doesn't have you rolling in the

aisles, you need to have a root canal for excitement

in your life!!!",1108944000,17,3095,4.677966101694915

But even for Scorsese, a comedy entails a word processor's date with a nice girl turning into an infinitely Kafka-esque nightmare where one bad episode follows another.  I recall seeing ""After Hours"" at the time and considered it to be unlike any film I'd ever seen.  It still holds up well.  The only films akin to the work Scorsese has done here may be the work of the Coen brothers.  Griffin Dunne is great as the harried lead and he is complemented with a great supporting cast.

293051,4,6300270912,"""After Hours"" is the out of control spiraling saga of mild mannered Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne), a number cruncher whose chance meeting with the seemingly harmless, Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) leads to an increasingly perilous adventure. Marcy is full of interesting stories and this is precisely why Paul is initially attracted to her. However, Marcy's behavior becomes increasingly unstable and Paul bolts. Feeling like a jerk, which of course he is, Paul decides to return for an apology but discovers Marcy dead in her bedroom. Unfortunately for Paul, he soon finds himself the focus of a troupe of vigilantes who believe he's responsible for a string of burglaries. Eventually, Paul's artist friend offers him a means of escape by turning him into a Paper Mache figure - go figure?!? Scorsese populates his city-scape with a cavalcade of crazies, including Terri Garr's neurotic/compulsive waitress and Cheech and Chong as the pair of burglars on the prowl. This is a crazy adventure but one which does not tread the typical wacky conventions of the genre. Rather, it presents one man's folly as the beginnings of a terrifying ""Silence-of-the-Lambs-ish"" experience in which mediocrity is favored over free-spiritness.

Although much maligned by many critics upon its initial release, ""After Hours"" has since developed a cult following that has spilled into the mainstream. Critics and poor box office aside, the film is a tour de force of set pieces with an eerie, unsettling quality and some very grim, black humor that is outstanding.

Warner's DVD delivers a very nice looking vintage 80s image. Colors are vibrant and flesh tones are accurately rendered. Black levels are deep and white are very clean. Film grain and a hint of dirt are present but do not distract. There are no digital anomalies for a very smooth picture that will not disappoint. The audio is mono and nicely cleaned up and balanced.

It's one of those movies that continues to spiral every which way until the final hysterical shot. Arquette, O'Hara, and Garr are all perfect in this as well.

Scorcese perectly catches the paranoid urban drama/fish-out-of-water story and turns it into a hillarious comic nightmare.  There are so many unforgtable scenes in this film.

293053,5,6300270912,"Scorsese At His Comic Best

 After Hours is one of Scorcese's underrated comedies. One of the first big films in the 80's to compress its entire story as an occurrence a brief, compressed period of time, that being a single - seemingly endless - night in the life of a dreary, over-ordinary word processor. In many regards Scorcese's timing could not be more perfect, coming smack in the middle of the bloated 80's. We meet Paul who seems to be an allegory for entire decade; a boring, intelligent, word processor going nowhere. He meets Marcy and in a matter of hours the seemingly simple quest of ""getting home"" turns into an eternal nightmare; finally when mistakenly identified as a gay burglar he is chased down by an angry neighborhood mob (the chase also involves a slow-moving Mr. Softee Ice Cream truck). The ""after hours"" scene at what was earlier the Berlin Club where Paul pulls himself together to dance with a patron to Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?"" is one of cinema's great tragicomic moments.

 Martin assembled an extraordinarily starry cast some of whom appear in roles that last but a moment, and all seem to relish their roles making each a complete and vital character.

 I think what makes this movie so uniquely universal is how many of us have had nights of similar demented dimensions. It's a Wizard of Oz film for the 80's but without any of the help of the fellow Yellow Brick Road gang.

It is a movie I can relate to being like Griffin Dunne's character of Paul in sharing his loneliness, mounting frustration, fear, shame, and guilt as he tries to survive the worst night of his life, to some extent I've had some experience.  Very surreal, this movie is like one long nightmare which one can never wake up from. Plus, I never wanted it to end because you never know what's going to happen next.  It's like this: a well-off-but-lonely New York City yuppie leaves his sterile apartment for a night out and pays a visit to a very different neighborhood of SoHo where it seems everyone is connected and looking out for each other, where as everyone where he lives in the Upper East Side keeps to themselves.  Paul's rational sensibilities are at first intrigued, then terrified by the irrational, emotional and creative energies of this neighborhood, which is populated by every kind of different wierdo one seldom sees in person. But overall: I think that the movie is a tragedy because Paul, like a lot of unsure-of-themselves people, is stuck between these two worlds of the wild and crazy SoHo, and the prim and proper Upper East Side, yet he belongs to neither.  He seeks escape to the mundane, orderly and boring world in his office that his day makes up and finds the offbeat, freer lifestyle in SoHo intimidating, scary and dangerous. (SPOILER ALERT) In the end, through a combination of luck, skill, and divine intervention, Paul is rescued from certain danger (including death) and delivered back to the safety and cold comfort of his computers where he works.

So rich in detail and the cinematography is excellent.  So many great shots...  His only $20 flying out the window of the cab.  The keys being thrown from the roof.  And I LOVE the look on his face when he meets Horst.  You can only see one wide eye over Horst's shoulder as Paul tries to assess his safety and the weird bondage scene he has just walked in on, while Horst makes him apologize for being rude.  I've never seen so much expression out of just a quarter of someone's face.  As I said, this is a perfect movie from start to finish.  Every minute of it.  I loved this movie so much when I first saw it, that my first fake ID in high school carried the name Paul Hackett.  Hehe.  Plus, it's hard not to identify with Paul for a lot of us.  He doesn't lead the most exciting existence, and ALL HE WANTS TO DO is meet up with this beautiful woman that seems interested in him (to his amazement), only to have her turn out to be a total freak (and worse) and have EVERYTHING go wrong.  He is SO out of his element the entire movie.  So funny and surreal.  A true masterpiece.",1062979200,13,1255,4.175732217573222

  Whoever casted this movie did a great job.  Cheech and Chong, Catherine O Hara, Linda Florentino, Terri Garr, John Heard, and Megan Heath.  You will not be able to tell where this movie goes from one minute to the next, and Griffin Dunne is one of the funniest leads in a comedic film EVER.  His reactions as he watches his predicament go from bad to worse are priceless.
  This movie is New York underworld after midnight. Scorsese confidently let his story get infused with a continual line of characters and situations that feel so fresh I suspect there was a deal of improv done.  In some respects its similiar to Pulp Fiction, and just about as good.  I miss Megan Heath the most!",1043625600,6,909,4.421686746987952

If you're expecting an Italian Mafia movie, then think again!  Shot for only $4 million, in this DARK COMEDY you will follow a lonely computer programmer Paul Hackett (excellently played by Griffin Dunne) into the dark streets and through the late hours of the night. I'm not going to give away anything but all that I have to say is: A NIGHT FROM HELL!! Griffin's character is so realistic and beilevable, you just can't help getting sucked in! The main music in the film is awsome! It's very mysterious and sets the tone very well!  Basically, this film is a masterpiece!!

293105,5,6300270912,"Right now I just finished watching 'After Hours,' a film that
makes me somewhat home- and timesick for Soho and the Village in the late 80s.  Griffin Dunne is absolutely perfect as the hapless everyguy, and I love the supporting cast, esp. Teri Garr, Linda Fiorentino and Catherine O'Hara (who is great in everything she's in, so long as she plays annoying people;  esp. 'Best in Show.')  There is a sick poetic justice to 'After Hours,' and is the darkest of black comedies I've seen yet.  It's not one of Scorsese's better known movies, and along with 'The King of Comedy,' it is the only comedy I've known Scorsese to have directed.  But, it is a small gem and you can tell a New Yorker made it.  Only a New Yorker can understand the horror of being stalked by a vigilante mob, spearheaded by a Mr. Softee ice cream truck!!!!  The pace of the movie is rapid-fire, too.  Sort of like the cadence of Scorsese's voice when he's excited (which is all the time).  I remember when it came out, it did not do boffo box office because, as one friend told me, ""It's too depressing and negative for a comedy!""  I think he missed the point.",1031788800,5,1132,4.42512077294686

While one could argue that 'after hours' New York City is truly the centerpiece to this comedy, give credit where credit is due to Griffin Dunne; he plays an average schmoe with a penchant for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  AFTER HOURS has, for very long, been wrongly labeled a 'caper film'; there is no central storyline other than the exploration of one man's continuous series of misadventures and the unlikely malcontents he meets along the way.  Darkly comic and not laugh-out-loud hysterical, it may not be to everyone's liking, but it's definitely worth one viewing if for no other reason than to explore sheer filmed lunacy.",1024358400,,738,4.75

This is a very, very funny film and I would have been laughing except that I was identifying so well with Griffin Dunne's character that it didn't seem funny.

Eventually, like Dorothy, all he really wants to do is escape from this nightmare and go home, but fate conspires against him there, too. This is an extremely dark comedy, not for everyone, but if you're in the right mood, you'll love it. Griffin Dunne has never been funnier, or Scorsese's direction more frantically energetic.

293134,5,6300270912,"This film by Martin Scorcese is quite simply the most underrated and underappreciated film in existence today. It is the comedic story of one man stuck in an excruciating cycle of mishaps and strange occurences on a single night in the SoHo district of New York. But the film is not merely a well-concocted comedy. It is the story of human existence on Earth, exemplified in the life one one man and his travails on a fateful night. The story begins with Paul (Griffin Dunne) in his office, anxiously awaiting his escape from the monotony of the work day. That night, he goes out just to ""have a little fun,"" only to find that eventually, all he really wants is to get back to the safe harbor of work.  Throughout the film, Paul keeps saying that he wants to go ""home."" In the end, we see what he means as the pearly white gates of his office complex swing open, and Paul, all white and angelic (and/or dead)-looking enters with relief. What was out in the world for him? Excitement? Yes. But also trouble. Pain and suffering, and the feeling that the whole world was out to get him. Ever feel like that?  This movie works so well on both levels, plot and thematic, that the latter is nearly forgotten or unnoticed by the average viewer.

293135,4,6300270912,"How often are you on the streets of the Big City after midnight? Have you ever wondered if maybe sleeping at night, a habit followed by ""normal"" people, acts as a filter that otherwise allows through some marginally dysfunctional individuals?
In the 1985 film AFTER HOURS, Griffin Dunne, an actor vaguely reminiscent of Dudley Moore, plays Paul Hackett, an anonymous computer nerd working in New York City at some mind-numbing post in a high-rise cubicle. He lives, eats, and sleeps isolated in a sterile apartment, without even a goldfish for company. Paul needs to get out more.
Late one evening, while reading alone at a local caf&eacute;, Hackett is approached by Marcy, captivatingly played by Roseanna Arquette, who comments on his reading tastes. One thing leads to another with wild abandon, and soon she gives him her phone number thinking he may wish to buy one of her roommate's craftsy creations - a paperweight disguised as a plaster of paris bagel-with-cream cheese. Later, Paul calls. Amazingly, Marcy invites him to her place in SoHo, even though it's soon to be past midnight.
Arriving at the loft Marcy shares with her roommate, the nonchalantly sexy Kiki, Hackett is told by the latter that Marcy has stepped out for a moment to the local pharmacy. Paul asks, ""Is she alright?"" Kiki's answer, the disconcerting nature of which should give our hero an intimation as to what awaits him AFTER HOURS, is: ""It's under control"". And to whom is Kiki alluding when she casually mentions people she's known whose bodies are disfigured by horrible scars? Marcy is unblemished ... isn't she?
By the end of the film, when Paul staggers exhausted into his workplace the next day covered in plaster dust, the diversion has been watching Hackett ricochet from one situation to the next, and one denizen of the night to the next, each of which exhibits a certain disconnection with reality that Paul's coping skills can almost, but not quite, navigate. Indeed, on at least a couple of occasions, Hackett has the opportunity to become intimate with an attractive (albeit slightly askew) woman, only to have the opportunity snatched away by bizarre circumstance. Is it all a cosmic joke? Why, for instance, does the edgy blond waitress, played so appropriately by Teri Garr, surround her bed with mousetraps? (Squeak!)
AFTER HOURS is not a great film by any standard, but it is darkly humorous and off-beat enough to be thoroughly enjoyable, and to remind the viewer why it was Mom and Dad cautioned one to be home by the witching hour.",980121600,2,2537,4.916083916083916

I always thought it a shame that Griffin Dunne was  never really recognized by the studios or the public.  He possesses those  subtle facial expressions of fear, frustration and dismay that make him  incredibly likable.  Maybe he's too much like us and the general public  needs guys who are tougher, better looking, or more knd than we are.  Griffin Dunne never is in movies.  He's real.

Teri Garr is  fantastic - nice but scary. Rosanna Arquette plays the role of her career.  And New York itself is irrestistible - not the shiny  slick metropolis that  we are usually presented with, or the gangster-ridden crime land, but a  human, vulnerable, strange and at times silly city full of secret  compartments and surprises.
