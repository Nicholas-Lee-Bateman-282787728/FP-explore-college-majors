8712322,3,B00W6LU6IC,I have seen this true story and it is an awesome show of the human nature in adverse conditions where there is community and love. I would rate the movie Five stars but this is region 2 and not playable on USA dvds.  If they convert to region 1 I will try again,1495152000,3,261,3.9245283018867925
8712323,5,B00W6LU6IC,"A beautiful story about a man named Mahir who leaves city life and his wife and daughters for some time in order to fulfill a mandated teaching career assignment in order to begin a local school in a very remote village.  Mahir becomes witness to the remote mountain town's life and marriage traditions as he fulfills his task of building a village school. Mahir quickly becomes an integral part of the mountain village as children fill his newly built schoolhouse. The most powerful character in the movie is a man named Aziz, one of the village chief's six son's  whom is handicapped and made fun of by the town's people.  The actor who plays the role of Aziz does a phenomenal job portraying the challenges, emotional pains and frustrations of being handicapped and unable to be able to verbally communicate with those around him who mistreat him. The story is about the teacher's relationship with Aziz and how he views him as a human being whom he believes has a lot of potential. Lots of powerful lessons are learned when a wife is found for Aziz quite by accident and how the townspeople behave afterward. Get your kleenex box out for you will be needing them.",1492128000,2,1167,4.655339805825243
