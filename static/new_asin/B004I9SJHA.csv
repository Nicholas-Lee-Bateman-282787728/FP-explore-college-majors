4384814,5,B004I9SJHA,This was a great find! Blurays are in great shape! The case was broken on delivers but nothing crazy the top just won't latch as but the bottom does so it's all good!!!,1423699200,,168,4.121212121212121
4384815,5,B004I9SJHA,Brought this dvd for my son and he loves it.,1423526400,,44,3.5
4384816,5,B004I9SJHA,Nice packing by Amazon and it's really a must have collection for wrestling fans..,1422144000,,82,4.928571428571429
4384817,4,B004I9SJHA,Every happy with everything's,1413158400,,29,6.5
4384818,5,B004I9SJHA,Very outstanding purchase . when i got it from the mail it was in good condition and the CD was wonderful !!! DX Greatest tag team ever !!,1404000000,,138,3.9642857142857144
4384819,1,B004I9SJHA,"Most of the 3 discs that come with this set are segments, Add that along with the minimum 3 minute intro for DX at the start of each match and it takes up a lot of time. The matches themselves are disappointing and unmemorable, Far from the best matches they had in their last few years together. I would not recommend this set at all.",1401840000,,335,4.1692307692307695
4384820,5,B004I9SJHA,I ordered this for my grandson who is into DX.  We watched it together.  It was very good to watch.,1398297600,,99,3.9
4384821,5,B004I9SJHA,My son loved this video! I liked the renting option better than buying. He will watch it a few times and then forget abt it,1388620800,,123,3.96
4384822,3,B004I9SJHA,"I love DX, but this set leaves a little to be desired. If it had been like the previous dvd set where they had ALL the matches, and ALL the pranks and in between shots, as well as the lead up to the 'reunion' I'd give this a five in a heartbeat. But it didn't, and I gave it a three because again, I love DX.",1385424000,,308,3.6818181818181817
4384823,5,B004I9SJHA,"Another thing I picked up for my grandson, like I said he is a wrestling nut and he enjoys that kind of things",1384732800,,110,3.8260869565217392
4384824,4,B004I9SJHA,"It was a great movie. However, it did not meet our expectations but, it was still good. We wish it was a little longer. Triple H and Shawn Michaels added some funny commentary to their matches.",1367884800,,193,4.388888888888889
4384825,5,B004I9SJHA,"yeah, they got 'two words for ya' ;)
I own all of the DX dvd/blu-ray releases. Why? I am amused by them. While sad to see them go (for the last time??), this one is probably one of the best ones. Little People's Court is just hilarious!",1366761600,,236,4.042553191489362
4384826,5,B004I9SJHA,"I've got two words for you!......Anywys, I love this DVD..Watching this brings back memories of DX..I am happy that it is part of my collection!",1362182400,,144,4.8
4384827,5,B004I9SJHA,awesome dvd loved it & you will also. relives thier glory days & matches they were in !!!! !!!!  !!!,1357776000,,100,4.0
4384828,4,B004I9SJHA,it was good.  It was not what I thought it would be but still enjoyed it.  Was worth what I paid.,1357084800,,97,3.5714285714285716
4384829,3,B004I9SJHA,"I am a huge DX fan so when I heard that this Blu-ray was out I was excited.  I was kind of disappointed with a good portion of what was actually on the Blu-ray.  There were some good matches and the segments were funny and I am glad that Shawn's farewell speech was included.  The biggest problems for me were a couple of things first and foremost is all the stuff with Hornswoggle, I was already expecting him being in some of the Blu-ray but wow it got annoying after awhile seeing how much he was in it.  The second point is what was missing from the Blu-ray.

I don't know what were on the special features for the DVD or if there was any at all but all the Special Features that were on the second disk should have been in the main content.  There where matches that where not in there that I thought would be.  There was a big problem when on the back of the Blu-ray there is a picture of DX with Vince wearing Shawn's hat no less about to do a DX chop that was not in the main content which I was ok with because I thought that it would be in the special features.  I was wrong unless I missed something that part is no where in the Blu-ray at all.  There really shouldn't be a picture of something on the back of the cover if is not included somewhere in the Blu-ray itself.

If you are looking for a great DX DVD then I suggest The New And Improved DX which is centers around when they returned in 2006.  That DVD is a fun time all around and Hornswoggle Free. :)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-New-and-Improved-DX/dp/B000KHX71M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: The New and Improved DX</a>",1337558400,,1649,4.5
4384830,4,B004I9SJHA,"I have been a loyal WWE fan since 1990. I own many WWE DVDs. One of my favorites has to be DX-One Last Stand. I have been a fan of Shawn Michaels since he was with the Rockers and HHH since they changed his character from the blueblood to the Game. When they joined forces during the Attitude era, it was awesome and when they rejoined several years later, it was even better! Even more than watching them wrestle was the entertainment I would get by listening to them on the microphone. You never knew what was going to come out of their mouths. That's why this DVD, as well as the other DX DVD, is fantastic!

I'm sure there are many segments and matches that were not included, but the ones that were were excellent. I also enjoyed seeing the ""outtakes"" that were included as a special feature. All so amazingly funny. This is definitely a must have if you are a DX and WWE fan!",1333411200,,881,4.275449101796407
4384831,5,B004I9SJHA,HUGH WRESTING FAN I RECEIVE THE DX IT ARRIVED ON TIME AS INDICATED PRIOR TO THE SHIPMENT HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR IN 2012,1326153600,,118,3.9583333333333335
4384832,3,B004I9SJHA,"A list of pro's and con's:

+ Cafeteria segment is very memorable
+ Summerslam Entrance and Match are very good
+ All Jeri-Show matches are entertaining
+ Little People's Court is amusing
+ Christmas segments are rewatchable and hilarious
+ Shawn gets more serious throughout the DVD with his Bret and Undertaker stuff, giving a breath of fresh-air from his immature attitude
+ Shawn's retirement speech
+ Jericho
+ Jon Heder

Cons:

- Hornswoggle
- Hart Dynasty matches are weak
- Some boring drawn out segments
- Super long DX entrances takes up tons of DvD space
- Almost no extras
- The Hell in a Cell match with Legacy is sort of dissapointing
- No Single's matches
- Merchandise selling gets ridiculous at times
- PG

It's a mixed-bag, the DVD feels a bit rushed, but it does provide some pretty good moments. Out of all my WWE dvd's though, I pop this one in the least. If you enjoy DX even in the PG era and you enjoy Jericho as well, I'd recommend this.",1313798400,5,962,4.448863636363637
4384833,5,B004I9SJHA,DX one last stand is a good dvd for alot of reasons you get alot of raw and smackdown footage thats not available on dvd  now though if you get the blu ray you get 5  or 6 extra matches in the regular dvd they show all of the matches dx won except for one match and in the blu ray bonus footage you basicaly get the ones they lost witch is a great bonus to have because the talk about them through out the dvd and it makes you want to see them so bsicly in the blu ray you truly get DX entire last stand and hbks retirment speech witch is only available on one other dvd and that is the best of raw 2010 amazing blu ray loved it go pick it up,1311292800,,642,3.713235294117647
4384834,5,B004I9SJHA,"The two of them are given ample time to joke around and interview together. The matches picked weren't spectacular, but were good choices given what there was to choose from. Lots of content as well. The blu-ray does have a couple of extra features, but overall you wouldn't be missing much if you wind up with the DVD.",1309564800,,319,4.517241379310345
4384835,3,B004I9SJHA,"Are you ready for this review? NO I SAID... euhhh... forget it, we're not doing that. WWE have released another DX DVD, and my first thought was that it would include the footage that I expected to be on the last DX release, but no... it starts from the point when Shawn Michael's had quit the WWE and was working as a chef, which is a funny segment, but a different skecth I am still disappointed with not being found on either of the DX box sets is the ""Controversy"" sketch, where Triple-H tells Shawn that someone said he's not controversial enough, so Shawn gets angry and shows how controversial he is by delivering Sweet Chun Music to about 3 stage hands out the back of the show... why is that not on any of these sets?

Well, as I said, this one starts from the chef sketch, and goes right on through to the retirement of the heart break kid. It starts off with HHH and HBK in an army tank who are talking about going hunting, and this runs throughout the coarse of the movie as they talk to each other in DX character and so forth, then onto a sketch and match and what not.

There isn't really much more to say other then, If you're a fan of DX, you should enjoy this 3 disc set; if you didn't like DX, why would you bother to read reviews about it? If the trailer for this thing doesn't convince you to watch it or avoid it, then we got two words for ya.... go away.

One thing I will complain a bit more on is the cover of this DVD packaging. I really wish these cardboard folders would be banned from being sold as DVD sleeves. I just want a normal sized, plastic DVD cover and put these with the rest of them, but instead I have to either have tacky looking cardboard ones or customize a new packaging for it. Which is easy to make a cover for as you just take the sleeves out of these things and use that for the front... but wait a minute, this one here has no sleeve... and no details are written about it on the back of the box, or anywhere else? WTH is this? No DVD information on the entire box? I know in this day and age you have the internet for that sort of thing, and I can see in other reviews here what the contents are, but come on, how hard is it to print match/sketch details on these things?

Something else that disappointed me a little was someone had mentioned this was going to be a complete history of DX, showing footage from back in the attitude era when DX first formed... I think what that review meant to say was, there is about 10 seconds of footage from a highlight reel in the intro of this DVD and everything else is where the last DX DVD ended. But hopefully one day soon the WWE will realize that there would be a huge profit to be made from doing NEW dvds on the Attitude era and include everything they can, including an original DX release... not just that short highlights package they released on VHS then screwed up the DVD transfer by censoring it. No, we need a DX video that shows how DX started, continued, include the DX2000 stuff that is never mentioned, and then onto where the reunion started... or even, keep these two DVDS, and make one that leads to up to the point of the last two's beginnings.

Well, it sounds like I have slammed a few things against this DVD, but overall, I enjoyed it... I just feel like I would enjoy it more if they would just give us what we want already, and stop leaving things out.",1306713600,,3373,4.175115207373272
4384836,3,B004I9SJHA,"My son liked this DVD...he is a WWE GX fan.  Of course, GX no longer exists because Shawn Michaels retired.",1305849600,,107,4.35
4384837,3,B004I9SJHA,The blu-ray copy of this dvd was fine. I enjoy anything that DX did. The problem i had was the item on the web page said that this was a 3 dvd pack and the price reflected it. I was very disapointed when i recieved the item & it actually had only 2 discs. I returned the item and got a refund. I see that Amazon has since changed the web page and now it shows that there are in fact only 2 discs. I would have kept the item if i knew that now i have to reorder the dvd all over again.,1304640000,,484,3.6634615384615383
4384838,5,B004I9SJHA,I bought this especially for my husband but when we watched it to my surprise was excellent.. I could not have purchased a better wrestling video of the top two superstars..,1304640000,,173,4.612903225806452
4384839,5,B004I9SJHA,"All I can say flat out great DVD thought the DX hornswoggle angle was stupid but W/E. Good matches great TLC match vs Jerishow at TLC '09. Plus it had HBKs farewell uncut which was one of the best segments. Thank You HBK. If you love DX you need this DVD cause lets face it, it is their last one. :)",1304121600,3,299,3.918032786885246
4384840,2,B004I9SJHA,"DX is a faction that appeared in the late 90's and had some fantastic and memorable moments in their glory days. Yet, in 2009-10 wrestling has changed to a more family friendly product, taking away a lot of what made DX great. What we're left with is a collection of very corny skits and not a lot of overall excitement. Pretty lame. I will say, there are a few good wrestling matches on here, like Survivor series 2009, but there is nothing here that makes it a must own or that you can't get elsewhere on a stronger WWE release. If you're a DX fanatic, then by all means complete your collection. Casual and even collector fans can skip. Your money is better spent on a different title. Just my 2 cents.",1303948800,,705,4.348484848484849
4384841,5,B004I9SJHA,"DX love em or hate em, is one of if not the most popular stables in WWE history. This is the third DX DVD that I know of. There was D-Generation X, The New and Improved DX and now this. The 1st covered DX from the 90s. The 2nd covered the reformed DX from 2006. And the last covers the reunited DX from 2009-10. My only problem is that there is no inbetween. Matches like DX vs Rated RKO and DX vs Miz and Morrison have been denied from DX DVDs because they weren't covered in that time period. I wish there was a DX DVD that covered the best of DX of all time. Skits and matches from DX that were the greatest. Mostly for matches and skits that were denied a DX DVD spot. As far as this one goes, I'll definitely get it. I still have yet to see DX vs JeriShow TLC. And I missed quite of couple of skits on here. My only wish is there was a box-set or something that included the ""World's Biggest Member"" t-shirt, becuase I never got one and I can't find one anywhere. (WWEShop doesn't sell them anymore. WTF??)",1303776000,,1011,4.06
4384842,4,B004I9SJHA,"Quick review: this video has a few tag matches, one with legacy, a tlc match with jerishow, hart dynasty, and hbk's retirement speech. Worth watching but there is no classic dx clips as it focuses on their last 6 months.  Also there is very little hornswoggle, luckily.",1303603200,,269,4.723404255319149
