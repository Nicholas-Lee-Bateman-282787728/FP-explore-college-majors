8346480,4,B001VILFMC,"The guy goes over everything pretty well and in detail.  The one annoying thing is that sometimes he has customized guns in there that have different set ups from a normal Marlin.  I think he should just have stock factory guns for showing the disassembly etc.  The video doesnt have chapter selections either so you have to skip and fast forward around to get to the part you want to know about.
  If you have problems taking the rifle apart and putting back together for just cleaning and maintenace you can find videos on [...] that will show you the basics and maybe save you the $35 cost of this video.  I have a Marlin 336 and Marlin 1895G and this video helped me learn the parts of the guns better but a lot of it is more than I really needed to know for just cleaning.",1270252800,5,777,4.2517006802721085
