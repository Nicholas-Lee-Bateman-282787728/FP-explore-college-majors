8566554,2,B00BD4K4NK,I was thinking this was going to be a high quality production. Being produced by who it was produced by I thought high quality video in a mix of old and new material. Well it's not authorized! It reminds me a lot of the old Madonna DVD's that were just collections of old TV interviews. No wonder it sells for such a bargain price. You get what you pay for. One england interview I've never seen but the rest is garbage I already have. And this interview is an old copy and not a master so the quality is horrible. If you love her you have to have everything but otherwise...give this a miss.,1368662400,7,592,4.201754385964913
