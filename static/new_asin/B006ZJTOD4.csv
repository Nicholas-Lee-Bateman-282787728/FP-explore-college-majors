8506936,4,B006ZJTOD4,"If you liked Charlie Daniels back in the day, you'll like this DVD. The sound and video is dated, but other than that, no complaints. It's a good one.",1503878400,,150,4.206896551724138
8506937,3,B006ZJTOD4,Kinda of grainy but it is awesome to see Charlie Daniels perform. Sound quality is good but video quality is B- at best. It is watchable just don;t expect HD quality. More like a VHS copy quality video.,1483401600,,202,4.342105263157895

8506939,5,B006ZJTOD4,"If you need some boogie woogie, if you need some down home rockin', if you need to see big bearded men sweating in cowboy hats, you need go no further, for you have found it all within this concert. The Charlie Daniels Band Live at Rockpalast is chock full of good time, aww shucks fun with all of their biggest hits represented. And this concert, recorded November 28th 1980 looks pretty damn good considering its age. The one drawback that I have with most of the Rockpalast releases (and it may be only my problem) is the shows insistence on putting the song titles at the bottom of the screen as the song is playing. At one point, during an encore number, they paste a great big CHARLIE DANIELS BAND across the whole screen for about 15 seconds. Annoying. Again, I'm probably nitpicking. Because of the rarity of the show, and the age of the film, most everything can be forgiven. I just want to make the viewer aware. This is a full screen release, and the picture is fair, with some softness here and there, and some color banding at points as well. It never becomes annoying, but you'll notice it from time to time. There is pretty good stereo sound throughout, and my only complaint on that front would have been to boost the bottom end a little bit. Let's get the bands history up to 1980.

Wikipedia
Daniels is a singer, guitarist, and fiddler, who began writing and performing in the 1950s. In 1964, Daniels co-wrote ""It Hurts Me"" (a song which Elvis Presley recorded) with Joy Byers. He worked as a Nashville session musician, often for producer Bob Johnston, including playing electric bass on three Bob Dylan albums during 1969 and 1970, and on recordings by Leonard Cohen. Daniels recorded his first solo album, Charlie Daniels, in 1971. He produced the 1969 album by The Youngbloods, Elephant Mountain and played the violin on ""Darkness, Darkness"".

His first hit, the novelty song ""Uneasy Rider"", was from his 1973 second album, Honey in the Rock, and reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100.

During this period, Daniels played fiddle on many of The Marshall Tucker Band's early albums: ""A New Life"", ""Where We All Belong"", ""Searchin' For a Rainbow"", ""Long Hard Ride"" and ""Carolina Dreams"". Daniels can be heard on the live portion of the ""Where We All Belong"" album, recorded in Milwaukee, WI on July 11, 1974.

In 1974, Daniels organized the first in a series of Volunteer Jam concerts based in or around Nashville, Tennessee, often playing with members of Barefoot Jerry.

In 1975, he had a top 30 hit as leader of the Charlie Daniels Band with the Southern rock self-identification anthem ""The South's Gonna Do It Again"". ""Long Haired Country Boy"" was a minor hit in that year. Daniels played fiddle on Hank Williams, Jr.'s 1975 album Hank Williams, Jr. and Friends.

Daniels won the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance in 1979 for ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"", which reached No. 3 on the Hot 100 in September 1979. The following year, ""Devil"" became a major crossover success on rock radio stations after its inclusion on the soundtrack for the hit movie Urban Cowboy. Daniels appeared in the movie. The song is by far Daniels' greatest success, still receiving regular airplay on U.S. classic rock and country stations, and is well-known even among audiences who eschew country music in general. A hard rock/heavy metal cover version of the song was included in the video game Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock as the final guitar battle against the last boss (Lou, the devil).

Subsequent Daniels pop hits included ""In America"" (#11 in 1980), and ""The Legend of Wooley Swamp"" (#31 in 1980). In 1980, Daniels participated in the country music concept album, The Legend of Jesse James.

8506940,4,B006ZJTOD4,I am somewhere between like and love this Charlie Daniels DVD. I would have rated it 5 Stars outright if it would have had Caballo Diablo on it.,1367452800,,144,4.178571428571429
8506941,5,B006ZJTOD4,"This dvd simply captures the CDB at their very best, back in their prime. You do get some lead vocals from Taz Di GreGorio the keyboard player, and Tom Crain on electric guitar. In this classic 1970's CDB style, you get the line up with 2 drummers, like the Allman Brothers Band. I saw the CDB live back in the 1970's with this exact line-up, on this dvd.

This was filmed at the Rockpalast Music Festival in Germany, in November, 1980.
The total running time is 76 minutes.

The song set is as follows:
It starts off with an instrumental of the ""Tennessee Waltz"", just like the CDB did at their concerts back in the 1970's.

8506942,5,B006ZJTOD4,A great DVD featuring the CDB in Germany.  Most of what has been available so far has been concerts in the USA so this is a little piece of history for CDB fans (or anyone who likes great Southern Rock) to enjoy!  :),1351123200,,216,4.0
8506943,5,B006ZJTOD4,"Take a southern rock outfit out of the United States and put them on stage in Germany, what do you get? If it is the Charlie Daniels Band, you get over an hour of solid music, despite the unenthusiastic crowd response. Live At Rockpalast was recorded on November 28, 1980, at Westfalenhalle, Dortmund, Germany. The group's best known songs are here, from ""Legend of Wooley Swamp"" to ""Long Haired Country Boy,"" and of course ""Devil Went Down To Georgia."" But there are also a number of ""deep cuts,"" songs from the then-current release Full Moon, including ""El Toreador"" and ""No Potion For The Pain."" There are slight variations in the performance of ""Uneasy Rider,"" and the set ends with a rousing rendition of ""Orange Blossom Special,"" clocking in at eight minutes and forty-five seconds. Without question, this is a great concert DVD that will be replayed a number of times.",1345420800,,875,4.84
8506944,5,B006ZJTOD4,"I watched this last night for the first time and was very impressed with it, they need to release more of this good old stuff. Charlie was at the top of his game that night so was Tom Crain, the guitar interplay between these two was amazing. Charlie is a way better guitarist than fiddle player which I have always known, but Tom blew me away he did most of the slide and solos along with some vocals. Then we have Taz DiGrgorio who is also great, he does some excellent piano playing and also does some of the vocals. They feature two drummers that really fill out the sound, for the time(1980)the picture and sound are great. Tom & Charlie together kind of remind me of footage I have seen of Duane Allman & Dickey Betts from 1971, they are not as good but pretty close, all in all this is a must have If you love Southern rock.",1341014400,6,831,4.2
