8345829,5,B001VA4DH4,"A noteworthy documentary of the formation of the UFW, and, along with Cesar Chavez and Delores Huerta, all the people who made it happen; including those across the nation and Canada who decided not to buy California table grapes. Huelga may not have been entirely successful, but by hitting the growers where it hurts (their pockets), it shows that everyone can make a difference, especially when they come together.",1522800000,,417,5.057971014492754

However, I just received this and a few others on Teaching Tolerance's website for free and included free shipping.  The only thing I needed was a school address.",1400371200,3,261,5.023255813953488
8345832,5,B001VA4DH4,"My friends and I attended most of the union gatherings and got to know Cesar, his wife Helen, and other leaders of the union. At their picnics we loved their gallina en mole, which I won't forget. This documentary brought back memories of the farm workers union. I give this DVD an A++. I highly recommend it. Viva la causa!",1395705600,6,324,4.416666666666667
