8474634,1,B005IGVTII,"JUST WATCHED NIGHT CRAWLERS & I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED. I WATCH ALOT OF B-MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS A Z-MOVIE IN TERMS OF BUDGE ETC...BUT GETS IT RIGHT. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A MICRO-BUDGET MOVIE, BUT IF YOU CAN GET PAST THAT AND YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY SUPRISED. ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS I NOTICED RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS THE MUSIC. SO MANY B-MOVIE/INDEPENDENT FILMS FAIL IN THIS DEPARTMENT. HERE HOWEVER, THE MUSIC, THE CAMERA ANGLES, THE STORY, WAS BETTER THAN MANY BIGGER BUDGET FILMS. GREAT CHARACTERS, GREAT HUMOR, AND SOME GENUINE THRILLS TO BOOT. THERE IS SOME WIRE WORK IN THE MOVIE AND YOU CAN SEE THE WIRES, BUT KEEP IN MIND A MOVIE OF THIS BUDGET RARELY EVEN TRIES ANYTHING AS AMBITIOUS AS WIRE WORK.  AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN SEE THE WIRES, SLIGHTLY, IT IS STILL A COOL SCENE. IT IS A REAL SHAME THIS MOVIE IS NOT MORE WELL KNOWN. THANK YOU BENJAMIN WILBANKS FOR WRITING & DIRECTING THIS GREAT LITTLE FILM!!  THIS WAS FILMED IN NORTH TEXAS. THE TITLE AND COVER ON THE BOX IS MISLEADING AND I AM CONCERNED THAT THE TARGET AUDIENCE (FOLKS THAT LIKE VAMPIRE FLICKS) MIGHT MISTAKE THIS FOR SOMEOTHER KIND OF HORROR MOVIE, BUT NOW YOU KNOW-THERE BE VAMPIRES ON THIS ROUND DISC!",1336694400,,1201,4.47945205479452
