6490241,5,B00LLI7IKU,"I loved this series! It was broadcast through the MHZ channel in the SF Bay Area this year until there was some dispute in July '14 when MHZ stopped broadcasting. I was pretty good about DVR'ing most of the episodes but I missed a couple in series 3 so I am anxious to have series 3 (and series 2 for that matter) become available through Amazon in a USA format (not PAL). I bought the series 1 so my husband and I could watch it together. It's our very favorite mystery detective series right now. I can't wait to get him hooked on Spiral, Montalbano and Nicholas le Floch, more great MHZ series you can purchase through Amazon... a least the initial seasons. The series' haunting music ""Forgiven"" by Jacob Groth & Misen Groth should also be made available as an MP3 download on Amazon. It is fantastic!",1409184000,2,804,4.4391891891891895
6490242,4,B00LLI7IKU,"This very fast-moving series, highly enjoyable, is perhaps slightly over-edited.  At times it was a bit too fast for me.  Do purchase, but read the blurb on the back of the case and pay close attention to the recaps appearing before individual episodes.",1408233600,3,253,4.8604651162790695
6490243,5,B00LLI7IKU,"The references to Greek mythology are one of the more intriguing aspects of THE EAGLE, a brilliant Danish police procedural produced in 2004 and now available on DVD here in North America. The more I watch these programs (mostly from Scandinavia, but also from France, Italy, Germany, etc.) that are released here by MHz International Mystery the more impressed I become by the high quality of virtually everything they produce--and I haven't even got round to some of the more well-known titles such as THE KILLING and WALLANDER. Like Acorn Media, which specializes in British mysteries, MHz International Mystery specializes in programming from Europe. Both companies have carved a niche for themselves and it has got to the point where virtually anything released on their label is guaranteed to be good.

Honestly, I'm not trying to write a commercial here, but for fans of this kind of programming (intelligent, well-produced alternatives to American shows) this is a god-send.

But back to THE EAGLE. Self described as ""a crime odyssey"", season one is indeed an epic journey as the crack crime-solving team headed by star investigator Hallgrim Hallgrimsson is formed then finds themselves chasing and foiling organized crime not only in Scandinavia, but in other parts of Europe as well. The budget for this show must have been considerable, as they filmed in various parts of northern Europe, from Berlin in Germany to Copenhagen in Denmark to Oslo in Norway and other locations including Iceland and Russia.

This show has style. First off, the protagonist, Hallgrimsson, is nicknamed ""The Eagle"" because of his ability to rise above everything and see the big picture, which makes him such a good mind for solving crimes. But at the same time, Hallgrimsson is clearly haunted by some traumatic childhood incident that we catch glimpses of in recurring flashbacks. Nothing new in that, but the way his introspective memories counterpoint against his crime solving perspective is a nice twist on the brilliant but troubled detective. Second, speaking of style, there is one really cool gun battle that references the great Russian classic film Battleship Potemkin, when, in the midst of gunfire, a woman loses control of her baby carriage, which rolls into harm's way. The good guy in the gun battle (one of Hallgrimsson's co-horts) manages to dive in front of the carriage and halt its descent into carnage, all the while carrying on with the gunfight. If this sounds familiar, it's because director Brian De Palma did the same thing in the more recent The Untouchables, with Andy Garcia being the hero of the day.

Hallgrimsson's colleagues are a real hodgepodge of personalities. Here is one of the main differences one might find between THE EAGLE and any number of American police procedurals: not everybody is trying to be cool, nor do we have twenty somethings trying to be believable as forensic experts. For this reviewer at any rate, this is a breath of fresh air.

THE EAGLE won an International Emmy from the International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for best non-American television drama series in 2005. Two more seasons were produced, which means we have a lot more to look forward to from THE EAGLE.

I can hardly wait.",1408233600,13,3252,5.0353159851301115
6490244,5,B00LLI7IKU,Great Well Done Foreign Series - Wouldn't Miss it - Very Hard to Find in a Region One DVD,1407542400,2,89,3.736842105263158
6490245,3,B00LLI7IKU,"I have no problem with subtitles; indeed, I number among my favorite series ""Wallander,"" ""Beck,"" and ""Van Veeteren,"" all three Swedish productions, and the French series ""Spiral."" What those three series - what any good series - offer are complex, realistic characters and plots. ""The Eagle"" is a mixed bag in both respects.

The title refers to the nickname of the main character, Hallgrim rn Hallgrimsson, whose middle name is Icelandic for eagle. The Eagle heads the operational side of a Danish government organization specializing in fighting international crime involving Denmark. The organization includes the usual cast of characters: a computer whiz, a forensics expert or two, a jack-of-all-trades tough guy, a blond love interest for The Eagle. The characters all have back stories (the most extensive, and oddest, being that of the main character), but the back stories lacked the depth necessary for me to feel emotionally invested in any of the characters. The entire series spans three seasons and a total of 24 episodes, all of which I watched when the series was available on Netflix. Each episode is about one hour in length, and the individual stories span two or three episodes.

The series relies heavily on super villains: criminals who seemingly are able to go anywhere, kill anyone, elude the police at will, and who have an army of henchmen at their beck and call. The first of these, Sergei, serves to illustrate some of the series' shortcomings (spoiler alert!). After killing four people at an airport - including two policemen and a security guard - while masterminding the ruse of an airliner hijacking, Sergei is taken into custody. Despite these crimes, he is transferred from one facility to another in a passenger car, his only escort being the police officers in the car with him. If you can't see where this is heading, you will enjoy this series. After his escape, Sergei kills several more people, traveling between Denmark and Norway seemingly at will, before again being captured. This time, when he is transported, to a ministry for questioning, the police have their act together - sort of. He is transported in a van with a heavily-armed SWAT team and motorcycle escort. Just about everybody involved is wearing body armor, except, of course, Sergei. And, just as unbelievably, the police fail to take the obvious precaution of securing the perimeter at their destination. Again, you know where this is headed. Plot contrivances that keep villains in play are effective when they are plausible and take the viewer by surprise, but often that is not the case in this series. (As an aside, the actor who plays Sergei, Thomas Gabrielsson, plays one of the lead characters in ""The Protectors,"" a series about the Danish Personal Protection Unit, an organization similar to the US Secret Service, a series that, in my opinion, is superior to ""The Eagle."")

Don't get me wrong: this is not a bad series, especially when compared to most of what the American TV industry produces: production values are high; the cinematography is good; the European settings are a nice change from those of American and British productions; the cast is competent; the stories are OK. My disappointment is that it could easily have been better.",1406678400,17,3263,5.016605166051661
6490246,5,B00LLI7IKU,"The Eagle - A Crime Odyssey, season 1 (Omen)

Finally Season 1 will be available on July 29th 2014, I've been waiting/hoping for S1 as it has been unavailable for awhile(I thought I would never be able to get the 1st season)! I already have Volumes 2-4 on this great series...now I'll be able to watch 1-4 as a complete series. This has become one of my favorite Nordic crime dramas. The characters are intriguing, great storylines & the action is fantastic...the actors are great & perfect for this setting. Well Done!!

I highly recommend the complete series of 'The Eagle - a crime odyssey' to those of you who do not mind subtitles & enjoy great crime dramas...you will not be disappointed if you invest in this superb series!!! I love Nordic/UK/Scandinavian crime dramas(they make them better & more enjoyable)!!!!

Thank You so much MHz Networks & Amazon for making S1 available. :-)",1405036800,36,889,4.759740259740259

6490250,4,B00LLI7IKU,"This is a worthy follow-on if you have an addiction to Nordic Noir and you've already seen all the episodes of Borgen, Wallander, and The Bridge.

The characters are interesting, complicated, and the plot twists are many. The dialog is reasonably good.  There are definitely some elements that strain credibility and made me roll my eyes... but it is a TV crime drama after all.  Also, technology regularly reminded me that I was watching a 10 year old series (love those cell phones... They do VIDEO on that little screen... amazing!).

Not without flaws, and not up to the standard of The Bridge or the first two seasons of Borgen... but very watchable, very enjoyable.  I was very glad I got it, and I've just now ordered Season Two.",1428364800,4,736,4.674418604651163

6490253,4,B00LLI7IKU,"A Danish police procedural featuring an engaging cast of characters.  The writers do a nice job with the plots and the characters, despite constraining themselves in ways that American writers would not.  Good guys and innocents almost never suffer permanent harm, but despite that there are ample thrills.  There is some gunplay and things going bang, but somewhat less than in a comparable American production.

The dialog seems less purple, and the sparring between police and perpetrators is more mature than comparable American shows.

Subtitled in English, even when the characters are speaking English, which makes for an interesting challenge, since I have to keep my eyes on the screen at all times to keep up with the action.

The opening is captivating, between the haunting Misen anthem ""Forgiveness"" and the dramatic atmospheric landscape shots of Iceland (at least, I think it's Iceland).",1423267200,,902,5.2727272727272725
6490254,5,B00LLI7IKU,"The entire series is superb.
The writing is excellent, all the topics are feasible and believable, with much cross border crime being one of the biggest ""pestilence"" at this time. The characters and actors are tremendous. All scenarios are portrayed realistically and are believable. I could not wait for the entire series to come out. One wishes all TV crime series to be this superb.

6490264,5,B00LLI7IKU,"One off the best crime series I've ever enjoyed. I am so hooked, but very frustrated it's been taken off the PBS channel. The DVDs are next to impossible to find. Season one is a start but I'd love Amazon to offer the whole series. I'll purchase the rest in a heart beat.

As for quality, all the actors turn in seamless performances. Everyone appears real and full of the lifeblood that must inhabit any character to be believable. This author has been in the business for years and knows the art form. The handsome lead, Jens Albinus, has a gentle but very charismatic appeal as do several of the other actors. The glimpses of breathtaking Iceland add an exotic flavor that enhances as well as advances each plot along with the unfolding history that threads throughout the series. The crime unit is based in Denmark and requires frequent travel to neighboring areas, which also serves to enrich the viewers overall experience. The theme music deserves a mention here as it is the final stroke of genius for this exceptional series adding an emotional component that is so hypnotic it goes very deep.

All in all, The Eagle - A Crime Odyssey is the perfect thoroughly absorbing escape. Kudos to the director(s) for turning in such accomplishments over and over. It will send you scurrying for more Jens Albinus wherever you can find him.",1411084800,4,1339,4.717948717948718
6490265,5,B00LLI7IKU,"This is a dazzling series.  I purchased this from Australia in 2009 and watched an episode every evening until completed.  I was so disappointed that the show ended.  There may be a few shortcomings for the pickiest of viewers, but for the rest of us who like an exciting series in interesting locations, nasty villains and a reasonably tight knit team to best them at crime, this is just fantastic.  I have watched through the entire series 4 times.  Between this and the Millenium Trilogy (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) I am forever hooked on Nordic Noir.",1410739200,2,560,4.673469387755102

8666365,3,B00LLI7IKU,"3/4/18 - I don't understand anyone giving this more than 3 stars.  The acting is horrible, especially from the male lead who has 2 expressions - blank and puzzled (which he achieves by pinching his eyebrows toward each other).  The stories are all predictable and uninspiring.  The male lead has several opportunities to shoot and kill the terrible Russian murderer but all he does is point his gun and run after him.  Ridiculous.  There is not likeable or believable person in this show.  Comparing it to Borgen or The Bridge is insulting to those great shows.",1520121600,,561,4.791666666666667

8666373,3,B00LLI7IKU,"Team work: all the characters are interesting, but the whole set (Season 1) seems to be mostly a showcase for Danish star Jens Albinus, the ""eagle"" detective who suffers from premonitory hallucinations (or hallucinatory premonitions -- same thing).  Unfortunately, an ""engaging set of characters"" (as another reviewer put it) is not enough; you also need a good plot.  And the plots are not that good, or not well presented.  Consider that each episode lasts just under one hour.  Now, in one-episode plots, one hour is not quite enough for a detailed exposition, and the ending seems hurried.  On the other hand, in two- or three-episode plots, the plot is more like a patchwork in which the pieces are just basted, not properly sewn together.

The price, though was right.  I am glad I waited, and I am glad I bought only the first season.  It will go straight to the public library.",1432598400,2,885,4.776315789473684
