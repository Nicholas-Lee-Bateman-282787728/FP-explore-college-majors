8052254,4,B0007VJL5C,"This is a very good LDS movie.  It's a good movie, period.  It's not quite up there with The RM or The Singles Ward, but it's close.  The acting is very good and the plot is both realistic and interesting.  I wish the film had a little bit more of an LDS flavor to it, but it has enough--enough that I think it's appropriate for Sundays.  Overall, I think this is a very good LDS movie.",1344297600,3,386,4.026315789473684
