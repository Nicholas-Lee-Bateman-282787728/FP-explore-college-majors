3509301,3,B001CDFY5A,"In spite of its intriguing title and central character, namely Harry Houdini, ""Death Defying Acts"" is not exactly about mystery or suspense. So don't expect big surprises of ""The Prestige."" ""Death Defying Acts,"" directed by Gillian Armstrong (Wynona Rider's ""Little Women"" and ""Oscar and Lucinda""), is more about the romance between Houdini (Guy Pearce) and a con artist Mary McGarvie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who passes for a spiritual medium.

The film is set in 1926, during the British tour of the great magician and debunker, and Houdini offers 10,000 dollars to anyone who can reveal the dying words of her mother. Impoverished Mary (living in a cemetery) manages to charm her way into Harry Houdini's life, first disguising herself as a hotel maid, looking for the clues as to the right answer, but she finds herself attracted to Houdini himself (though he is married).

The film, it is certain, has a very interesting story, plus the beautifully shot cinematography (part shot in London and Edinburgh on location). Gillian Armstrong even recreates some of Houdini's famous acts (like the straightjacket and the water torture) and these scenes are convincing, thanks to Guy Pearce's fine acting. Still, the story is not fully fleshed out (the $10,000 part is half forgotten until the climax) and certain part of the film (the mother-son / mother-daughter relations, especially) need to be explored more so that the film's denouement, interesting as it is, could be more powerful.

The two leads are not bad (though I think they are miscast), and always reliable Timothy Spall turns in solid acting as Sugarman, Houdini's concerned manager, but it is delightful Saoirse Ronan who really shines in ""Death Defying Acts"" as Benji, loving daughter of Mary, providing energy and power this film really needs. A bit of a prankster and love to be unpredictable, Saoirse Ronan's character is more interesting than any other characters in this film. Why didn't director Gillian Armstrong use her character more is a greater mystery than ""Death Defying Acts"" itself.",1261180800,,2060,5.161676646706587
3509302,4,B001CDFY5A,"This is a good flick with interesting actors. The plot is mostly fiction but, I think, Houdini, would have liked it. Zeta-Jones is always nice to watch and Saoirse Ronan made me look up the pronounciation of her name.",1230508800,,217,4.589743589743589
3509303,4,B001CDFY5A,"If you're looking for a hard facts or a psychologically insightful bio of the great Houdini, then Death Defying Acts will disappoint.  DDA is more a tea cake of a film, selecting odds and ends of facts from the life of the master illusionist and mixing them into a sweet, ""what-if"" confection.

Houdini did, in fact, mount an active campaign to debunk spiritualists and the Mary McGarvie of this film may have been suggested by a real life American psychic, ""Margery"" - one of  Houdini's prime targets.  Hardly the struggling single mother of this film, Margery Crandon was the popular wife of a Boston physician.  DDA is full of similar juxtapositions of fact with fantasy that make for a gently told story which I found pleasant to watch, but neither gripping, nor illuminating.

Within the context of the script, the principal actors are excellent, but as I write this I can't help imagining what it would be like to see Pearce, Jones, Ronan and Spall in a ""real-life"" version of the Houdini story.  One that probed the core of a man desperate for recognition, redemption, and resurrection.  All four of these actors certainly have the juice for a film with that kind of edge!

Technically, DDA is uneven.  In some instances the selection of locations and dressing of the sets is an early 20th Century enthusiasts dream.  In others, the sets looked rather economically built.  Beautifully filmed and edited crowd scenes are interspersed with some truly dull tracking shots and unimaginative cutting.

All that said... I enjoyed the film for what it was - a fantasy - and I'll watch it again.  Probably several more times.  So, if you're in need of an escape or a sweet taste of the guilty pleasure variety, this film fits that category perfectly!",1227052800,4,1749,4.802675585284281
3509304,2,B001CDFY5A,"""Death Defying Acts"" is not a movie biography of Harry Houdini. Instead, it takes a small thread and weaves it into a full-length movie. The story here centers around mother-daughter con artists Mary McGarvie [Catherine Zeta-Jones] and her street smart daughter Benji [Saoirse Ronan whose claim to fame is from the movie Atonement]who barely eke out a living in Edinburgh, Scotland. They put on shows at the local theatre, where they play exotic characters that are able to foretell the future [having done research beforehand on the history of someone in the audience, usually by pickpocketing an object belonging to said person]. When the pair find out that Harry Houdini [Guy Pearce] is coming to Edinburgh and is paying out a 10,000 reward to anyone who can 'divine' his mother's last words written in a letter only known to him, they decide to con him. I'm not sure if the romance part was based on actual events but Houdini was a member of a Scientific American committee that offered a cash prize to any psychic who could successfully prove paranormal abilities. The prize however was never collected in real life.

Well, things get complicated when Mary and Houdini get emotionally drawn to each other and the rest of the story deals with the consequences as well as Benji's attempts to get her mother focused on the main prize.

Frankly, I was rather disappointed with this movie - I felt that the mother-daughter chemistry was far from credible, as the pair simply didn't click, and Zeta-Jones even at her 'shabbiest' seemed utterly unconvincing as a down-on-her-luck woman. Her role in this movie definitely lacked 'meatiness' in terms of substance [she dolls up well enough but that's all that she did really well here as there was no real character development]. As to the romance thread in the movie, somehow the leads here lacked chemistry as well and their romance for what's its worth came across as unconvincing.

The one character that I felt was really well-done was Timothy Spall as Houdini's manager. He knows from the beginning that MacGarvie and Benji are con artists and tries to protect Houdini from them and from Houdini himself [sensing the emotional attachment between Houdini and Mary].

The production values are decent enough - I did like the opening scene where Pearce actually performs an underwater stunt. But such outstanding and memorable scenes are few and far between.

On the whole, this is not a bad movie, neither is it a great movie - there are just too many flaws that pull it down into mediocrity. As far as recent period dramas go, I'd recommend movies like The Illusionist, The Prestige and Perfume:Story of a Murderer, for ambience, plot intrigue and thrills.",1225929600,12,2707,4.914660831509847
3509305,4,B001CDFY5A,"Gillian Armstrong makes fine movies: she is a director who knows how to tell stories and enhance what appears on the surface to be reality with a healthy dose of fantasy. Her sense of pacing and image creation adds substance to her tales that sometimes border on bizarre.

DEATH DEFYING ACTS uses the character of Harry Houdini as the stimulus of to tell a story about the folk of Edinburgh, Scotland at a time when stage shows were embraced much the way America was using vaudeville - an escape from the rather dreary state of living to a world of entertainment and love of magic.  Mary McGarvie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her daughter Benji (Saoirse Ronan) survive in Edinburgh by picking pockets not merely for cash but for information to use in their act in the little theaters.  Mary does exotic dances then uses her 'gifts' to see into the 'other world' of people in the audience ( Benji does the investigative work and is the prompter for the s&eacute;ance like acts Mary performs).  Their idol is Harry Houdini (Guy Pearce) and when they learn Houdini is coming to Edinburgh to 'perform', they discover Houdini is promising $10,000 to anyone who can prove they have the ability to look into the future (or past).  Houdini's manager Sugarman (Timothy Spall) arranges Houdini's water tank escape acts and other acts of 'magic', and when Mary and Benji arrange to meet Houdini, Sugarman is aware they are charlatans.  How Mary and Benji work their way into Houdini's belief system and love life with their con game forms the meat of the sparing.

The atmosphere of the film is well captured by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos  who understands who to balance the mire of the streets of 1926 Edinburgh with the gorgeous fantasies used during Houdini's escape acts.  The musical score by Cezary Skubiszewski is a terrific mixture of Scottish tunes and instruments with solid melodramatic mood music.  Pearce, Zeta-Jones, Spall and Ronan turn in excellent performances.  This is an unjustly overlooked film that, while not being a masterpiece, serves up a fine story well told.

8287004,4,B001CDFY5A,I purchased this movie b/c I love Guy Pearce.  He was great in the part and CZ-J is very attractive. It was a fun little movie although purely fanciful. Seems to me this made-up romance did a disservice to Houdinis wife who in real life worked alongside her husband throughout their lives together. She kept a candle burning by his pic for 10 years after his death and conducted yearly seances in efforts to communicate with him. Plenty of real life fodder for romance here it would seem to me. Still a fun little movie and prompted me to read up on Houdinins actual. .,1522454400,,569,4.419047619047619

8287006,3,B001CDFY5A,"This started out really good. It had some history, some Vaudeville, some magic. Then once the ""lovers"" met up, it went all wrong. Zeta-Jones and Pierce have no chemistry. It makes the stiff writing so much more obvious. When we're talking about a love story, you just can't do without the chemistry.

The cast is good, just not all that great together. All in all, it was an okay movie, but not one I'd buy or see again.",1489968000,,420,4.384615384615385
