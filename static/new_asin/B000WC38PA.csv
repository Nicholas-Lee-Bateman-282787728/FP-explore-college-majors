8222335,3,B000WC38PA,"Lots of Elizabethan type mis-identities and masks being revealed.  People misunderstanding who loves who. People dying and reviving.  It has a bizarre, ambling soft psychedelia - implied magic, fantasy hinted at and primitive wire-work that is pleasant in it's creakiness.  Watching this was easy, actually.  Plot makes little sense (""Thought-dead Kung Fu baddie teams up with woman drug practitioner to take control of Kung-Fu masters."") but who cares?  The dubbing was actually pretty decent, the mix fairly well modulated except for a couple of really horribly voiced heroes.  In the end it all works out and our lovers find one another for the final fade out.  I can't fully explain why I sometimes uncritically like this stuff.  Maybe it's simply because it isn't glossy or overproduced (and certainly the arbitrary plot keeps throwing twists and turns at the viewer.)  Maybe it's simply because Keano Reeves is not in it (sorry, very cheap gag - I like ""Point Break."")",1215043200,2,974,5.113924050632911
