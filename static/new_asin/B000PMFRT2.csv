8192623,4,B000PMFRT2,"...there are quite a few errors within the film which need to be addressed.

The story is told through the eyes of a young boy.  Five-year-old Jonah witnesses his family's problems with anti-Semitism and German occupation in 1942 Amsterdam.  Although the family is allowed to live in the city during the early part of the occupation, they are soon sent to a transit camp in the outskirts of the city.  Jonah is told that they will be going to Palestine so to ease the pain.

The film jumps to three years later, where a more grown (seven- or eight-year-old) Jonah is in a concentration camp with other Jews of many nationalities.  The father has been separated from the family.  Jonah is still with his mother.  He is forced to deal with many situations that he cannot comprehend fully.  There are dealings with a group of cruel older children.  Jonah becomes witness to his father's failing health and, later, Red Army liberation.  I will not spoil the rest of the story.

For 1993, the movie is pretty good.  It feels and looks low budget (of course, the Ennio Morricone music aids in keeping the movie from falling to amateurish).  The acting, especially from the two actors who play Jonah are excellent (even though they don't have similar faces at all).  There are plenty of good secondary characters in the movie, such as the camp cook, the girl who befriends Jonah and his mother at the camp, the young German soldier in the liberation scene, and the older couple who aids Jonah's father earlier in the movie (and return in the end).  The actor who plays Jonah's father is really good, too.

That being said, the problems often outweigh the positive factors:  1) The camp sets are supposed to be on the outskirts of Amsterdam, yet large, looming mountains are ever-present in the backgrounds!  (It was filmed in Bulgaria), 2)  Many of the incidents in the 1945 section in particular would have never happened, especially with Dutch Jews who were detained in 1942.  There are examples abound, such as Jonah at age 7 or 8 and his mother being together in the camp, the seeming lack of any forced work going on, the mean older children that seem to be only loitering (their butts would be working hard!), the trains not even being packed with Jews (many are simply sitting on the floor and the freight cars are 1/4 full),  the dead bodies (not going to give that one away), and so on.  Finally, 3) Jonah's Mother.  Okay, she is the ""tear-jerker"" element in the movie, but simply cutting off her hair and not changing her outward appearance is lazy.  Even the actor who plays Jonah's father is somewhat realistically made over.  She is supposedly the ""strong person,"" yet becomes truly weak quickly in the movie and, I hate to put it this way, boring after a while.  Even a scene in the doctor's office with her husband is foolish and way out-of-place (not the incident, but her actions/reactions).

I didn't believe it was a failure, but it wasn't a remarkable piece of film making.  I have not seen ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" but have read ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel and seen many, many Holocaust movies (it is one of my favorite genres and area of study).  I have studied Holocaust theory and how memory plays a part.  I don't believe the problems with the movie are entirely unwarranted, but one has to remember that this is a 1993 film, not one made in the past 10 or 15 years.  Made today, and with a larger budget, this movie would be incredible (""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is probably that movie).

4 of 5 Amazon stars.  There is a non-graphic sexual scene, some violence (not overly graphic as later Holocaust movies tend to be).  In English, German, and either Yiddish and/or Hebrew.  The foreign languages are without subtitles - this being part of the ""through a child's eyes"" feel of the film.

My 13-year-old daughter, whom I have allowed to read Wiesel's ""Night,"" watch the movie ""Jacob the Liar"" (the 1974 East German version, not that American garbage), and several memoirs was able to watch and, other than the sexual situation, I did not feel that it would be too problematic for a child who was 11 or 12 to do so (this is my opinion, though).",1372896000,,4166,4.611413043478261
8192624,5,B000PMFRT2,"I first saw this film in a Holocaust class and the name of the film was ""Jonah Who Lived in the Whale.""  I looked everywhere for this and finally discovered the name change.  It is a story of events that occurred during WWII and how a family went from joyful to sadness.  Definitely would recommend this film.",1272326400,,309,4.385964912280702
8192625,5,B000PMFRT2,"LOOK TO THE SKY ('Jona che visse nella balena') is a little marvel of a film, one that stays with the viewer long after the credits are completed.  Originally made in 1993 in Italy from a story by Hugh Fleetwood and Roberto Faenza (who also directs), this honored film re-visits the Holocaust but almost entirely through a child's eyes. The complicity between the youthful innocence and the unspeakable reality results in a story, rendered by a superb cast, that shares an entirely different light on the effect of the Nazi 'Jewish Solution'.

Jonah at five years old (New Zealander Luke Petterson who was indeed age 5 when the movie was made) in 1942 lives in Amsterdam with his loving mother (Juliet Aubrey) and father (Jean-Hugues Anglade) in a family situation that is filled with love and optimism.  Into this setting advance the Nazi occupiers, brand all of the Jews with yellow stars and gradually sequester them, making life crowded and difficult.  Jonah narrates all of the action and his viewpoint is untainted by the reality of what is happening.  His family is finally removed from their home and transported to a Dutch village where Jonah is told they will all be headed for Palestine soon.  But instead of Palestine the intact family is transported to a concentration camp where Jonah and his mother are separated from his father.  Jonah watches as his mother is in forced labor and makes friends with other children as best he can, even winning a place in the kitchen for food secretly delivered by the camp cook.

Jonah ages to 8 years (Jenner Del Vecchio) and though frail he is able to exist under the protection and feigned optimism of his mother who repeatedly advises Jonah that whenever the world seems bad, 'look to the sky and never ever hate'. Jonah's father is allowed to see his family for a stolen moment, a time when the father and mother attempt to hide their anguish in a moment of passion, a moment Jonah witnesses.  Soon after, his father dies and eventually his mother dies at the moment when the Allied Forces are freeing the prisoners.  Jonah is returned to Amsterdam where he is taken in by friends of the family and how he deals with his memories so firmly embedded in his mind and manages to go on living is the tender ending to the story.

The 5-year-old Luke Petterson is a wonder as Jonah, managing to create a credible character almost entirely by facial expressions (his lines are minimal). And Aubrey and Anglade are superb as is the young Jenner Del Vecchio and the rest of the supporting cast.  The film is in English, Yiddish, and German but is without subtitles - a factor that actually enhances the story as Jonah does not understand the words of the Nazis, only their actions, and that places the audience in a compatible mindset with the child.  The cinematography by J&aacute;nos Kende captures the essence of beauty of Amsterdam as well as the horrors of the concentration camp and the award-winning score by Ennio Morricone is one of this master's finest.  Few films dealing with the Holocaust are as moving as this.  It is a must see for all viewers.  Grady Harp, December 07",1199059200,3,3131,4.706959706959707
