6669262,5,B00NMJQH1M,"I try to be most attentive during the Homily and even do the readings beforehand, yet the Homily and even Holy Scripture does not flow or transition easily and we learn in chunks without connecting the dots properly.  Father Barron has that rare gift, that ability to wade through Holy Scripture and Catholic Theology and present it to the average man in a delightful and understanding way.  Specifically in this series of talks he is dealing, in depth, with the nature of Jesus Christ and what he wants to accomplish.  And that has everything to do with us: if you want an understanding of. ""....you have received without cost and you must give without cost,"" then you will appreciate these beautifully presented talks.  May Jesus Christ be praised, now and forever.",1422489600,8,767,4.8320610687022905

6669267,5,B00NMJQH1M,"Priest, Prophet, King is a two-disc, six-lesson series which is designed to help you understand Jesus more fully as priest, prophet, and king. Each lesson is approximately 20 minutes long, and the study guide (which is written by Carl Olson) has enough material to facilitate an hour long discussion. If you're in a smaller group, like I am, you might find yourself watching the session two or three times, just to absorb the material. Unlike Fr. Barron's previous work, Catholicism, this sessions are much shorter (which I greatly appreciated), but they seemed to fly by so quickly that you might blink and miss something...hence the re-watching. The lessons are titled as follows:

1. Adoratio: Adam as Priest
2. The High Priest
3. Challenging False Worship: Elijah the Prophet
4. The Word Made Flesh
5. Ordering the Kingdom: King David
6. King of Kings
Bonus: Heroic Priesthood

In this study, Fr. Barron weaves high theology with his accessible teaching style to present Jesus' three-fold mission. One minute he is making Lord of the Rings references explaining symbolism of Frodo as priest, Gandalf as prophet, and Aragorn as King. The next minute he is diving deep into the Scriptures and explaining the significance of a specific Greek word. It was hard to pick a favorite lesson, but if I had to it would be Session Three, and that might just be because I am a big fan of Elijah. In addition to providing an explanation on Elijah vs the priests of Ba'al. He also challenges us to right worship. He then compares Ba'al to modern day idols like power or pleasure, and asks us if we put these idols ahead of God.

This was easily my favorite Fr. Barron study program. Each session was a good length (especially if you are doing this with young kids in the background), and provided you just enough information to get a good discussion going and make you want to dive deeper either solo or in a small group. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to grow not only in your understanding of Jesus, but your love for Him as well.",1418774400,17,2034,4.707865168539326

6669269,5,B00NMJQH1M,"What's the format?
Father Barron gives a series of six connected talks to an audience. Each is around 20 minutes long. This isn't as dull as it sounds because they intercut shots of masterpieces for illustration. This could have been released also in an audio format and I think I'd have gotten just as much from it. However, the video undoubtedly encourages group participation and discussion (there's a study workbook and leadership guide, though I haven't seen those). It did for us.

Was it worthwhile?
Yes. Many of the concepts and information presented may be new to viewers and will be eye opening in how they understand Christ. Although we were familiar with a fair amount of it already, Father Barron connected everything in a way that engaged us, made us think, and even had us stopping the dvd mid-episode sometimes to discuss things.

Did it change our lives?
Yes and no.

Why no?
Because, as my husband said while we were watching, ""The new evangelization is really the old evangelization. It's just that everyone forgot to do it lately.""

I myself am always wondering why I can't stick to a resolution to not bring up my Catholic faith. You wouldn't think you'd have to make such resolutions but time and again God's in the conversation. At the grocery store, at my movie group, on my nonreligious podcast. With believers and nonbelievers. All the time. He just ... comes up. I can't help it. And we help with various ministries at our parish as well as a few independent projects. So, as I say, we're already evangelizing just by the way we live our lives.

Why yes?
Father Barron gave us new ways to think about our own culture and where we fit in it as Catholics. Especially valuable and thought provoking were his discussions of:

  - The rose window imagery of ordering life
  - The devil as scattering, as dis-integration
  - Sin as wrongly oriented worship with focus on pleasure, wealth, power, and honor
  - Living in a society of accusers
  -Rene Girard's ideas about scapegoats and society

These are points resonated so strongly that they've been the focus through which we've discussed local news, politics, and personal relationships in our own lives. It has been very clarifying in a lot of cases.

Do I recommend it?
Yes. Definitely yes.

This is something that will benefit every American Catholic, no matter how involved they are, no matter how well they understand the Bible, no matter how well they feel they have a handle on living their faith.

I'm passing my copy on to our pastor. Hopefully it will be studied in our parish soon.",1418083200,11,2567,4.725842696629213

6669297,5,B00NMJQH1M,"Fr. Robert Barron has enhanced the understanding of the faith of many thousands of Catholics over the years with his Catholicism series, and now with this presentation deepens our understanding of Jesus Christ. To the Thomistic framework of understanding Him as a person wielding two natures, the human and the divine, he here adds the Biblical framework of understanding Him through His fulfilling simultaneously and seamlessly His offices as Priest, as Prophet, and as King. Fr. Barron's analysis is clear, comprehensive, convincing, and utterly rational. From my personal perspective of having been educated in the Catholic faith for sixteen years in Catholic elementary, secondary, and university classrooms, I can testify that Fr. Barron has nonetheless managed to add immensely both to my grasp of these profound truths, and to the certainty with which I hold them.",1437782400,5,871,5.411764705882353
6669298,5,B00NMJQH1M,"In this DVD set Father Robert Barron explores and expounds upon Jesus being the Priest, Prophet, and King. He sets up this program so you can reflect each position completely. He takes each ""office"" and starts with an example from the Old Testament and then the next talk he expounds on Christ fulfilling that ""office"" in his own way. This set is not like Catholicism where he travels the world. There is still imagery in this one, but this DVD set is  more along the lines of 7 Deadly Sins, 7 Lively Virtues. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1437091200,2,531,4.589473684210526

6669304,5,B00NMJQH1M,"Reviewing this in Amazon is literally preaching to the choir. Barron is way up there almost alone in the Catholic pantheon of pop-friendly but academically rigorous preaching. This DVD, though not as earthshaking as his earlier classic Catholicism Set, nonetheless delivers crystal clear epiphanies on the marvelous workings of our Church and the uplifted roles we rarely consider about our faith. Guaranteed to change one's heart. Who will not man up when one realizes that one is priest prophet and king just like Jesus?",1431302400,,522,5.226190476190476

8679153,5,B00NMJQH1M,"Would like to give it 4.5/5 but I can't.

Barron delivers six great sermons which could just as easily be given in any mainline Protestant church without raising any eyebrows. The message is a needed one and Barron is very passionate delivering it. The production values are outstanding, and Barron is an outstanding (and obviously highly trained) speaker.

Why not FIVE stars? Well, the talks, while great, sometimes go off-topic a bit. They don't just cover Jesus as a Priest, Prophet, and King like say an N. T. Wright lecture would. (My guess is they originally were sermons, and this is more like a sermon series at your church than a lecture series.)

Anyway, I plan to use most if not all at my PCUSA Sunday school class at sometime in the future once I buy the leaders guide (if there is one). As I cautioned in Mystery of God, the material might not go over well in a Fundamentalist or some Evangelical churches. However,  this material covers an area where Methodist, ELCA, UCC, and PCUSA theology are very close to that of our brother Catholics.",1462579200,2,1056,4.661290322580645
