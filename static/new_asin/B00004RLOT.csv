7921669,5,B00004RLOT,"In the tradition of ROCKY and REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT comes MATILDA (1978), the inspiring story of a pugilistic marsupial from Down Under who's granted one last shot at redemption by stepping into the ring and going a few rounds with the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion ( Larry Pennell ).  Old pros Gould and Mitchum add class and a gritty urgency to this rousing, one-of-a-kind experience, so much so that MATILDA remains one of the greatest, most enduring boxing films ever made.",1312416000,,485,4.914634146341464
7921670,4,B00004RLOT,"saw this back in 78 on hbo,one of the funniest flicks,iv ever seen. remember all the story too. thought it was out of print,but was gassed when i found one. of course the whole idea is pretty far fetched of a kangaroo fighting for the heavyweight championship,but the story is done well just the same. the ending was feel good all the way. im very glad to have this in my collection!!!",1288656000,,385,4.361111111111111
