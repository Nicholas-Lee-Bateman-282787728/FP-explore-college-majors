8092601,5,B000BTPVB8,"This is an excellent self-help book on how to use Emotional Freedom Techniques, a state-of-the-art means of reducing stress and eliminating distress. (For a demonstration of EFT, go to YouTube and search ""EFT"") However, this particular book is for those who want to learn a more advanced means of using EFT. Personally, as an Advanced Practitioner of EFT, I love it and am using it in my teaching. For the person who wants to know what EFT is all about, though, and wishes to learn to use it for self-help, I recommend Nick Ornter's best seller, The Tapping Solution. It's available at amazon.com.",1375660800,,597,4.805825242718447
8092602,5,B000BTPVB8,"The books, audio tapes, and video tapes by Jane and Phillip Mountrose have been instrumental in changing my life.  They have provided the bases for spiritual and personal changes that have brought me to re-evaluate my lifestyle, and the things I want to accomplish in this life.  They are well written, easy to understand, and contain simple exercises to help make the information useful and easy to apply.
I have read many self-help books over the years, and in most cases they have had very helpful information, but have been difficult to implement, or have failed to inspired me enough to make a change.  This is the first time I have been able to apply the information and techniques discussed, and made the necessary changes to my personal life.  As a result, I have shared these techniques with friends and collegues with amazing results.
I will be eternally grateful to Jane and Phillip Mountrose for their pure and insightful help.",1073865600,9,939,4.85
8092603,5,B000BTPVB8,"As a person going thru a divorce, I hoard anger and resentment. This anger had resulted in many sleepless nights, numerous days of grieving, and not living life to the fullest. Having watched this tape has enabled me not only to release a great portion of the anger and bitterness, but actually motivated me to ""weather out the storm"" and view the negative issues in a more positive manner. The Mountrose's explanation of the techniques are very comprehendible and a person is able to practice the array of techniques with their own emotional issues while viewing the tape. In addition, the muscle testing techniques are explained very well and are taught in a simplistic style that any novice is able to undertake. My best wishes to all of you in your healing journeys!",1039305600,13,770,4.796992481203008
