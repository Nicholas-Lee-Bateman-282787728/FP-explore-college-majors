8327757,1,B001NPUIYE,"Eagles stay true to form with exceptional harmony and song set.  Their voices and instruments have maintained the high quality throughout the years.  BUT the sound on this and the CDs is terrible.  It's as if it was recorded in a gym on an iphone.

Don't waste your money on this.  If you are looking for great Eagles live albums, go with Eagles Live or the slightly more mellow Hell Freezes Over.  They have the the same basic set with all their biggest songs but the audio is light years better.",1345593600,,497,4.406593406593407
8327758,1,B001NPUIYE,"This DVD was recorded in New Zealand in 1995, but the line-up and song list are much the same as the Eagles' ""Hell Freezes Over"" tour which made the rounds in the US in 1994.

I really liked the lineup with Don Felder in it, and I don't even mind all of the songs from the various members' solo careers. In fact, except for the electric version of Hotel California, the main distinction between the songs on this disc and the songs on Hell Freezes Over are the solo songs. So I was prepared to like this disc.

Unfortunately both the sound and the video quality are poor. The video, while admittedly shot in poor conditions (an outdoor theater in the middle of a rainstorm), is very grainy and looks more like a VHS tape than a DVD. The sound quality is equally poor. There is no bass to speak of, and the instruments are all jammed together in the center channel (in the Hell Freezes Over DVD, Felder's guitar is on the left and Joe Walsh's guitar is on the right, so who's playing what in their dueling lead guitar breaks is easily distinguishable).

The camera seems to focus a great deal on Don Henley, which is understandable on those songs on which he sings lead. But whereas the other band members can be shot from different angles, the camera seems to find only one angle to see Henley through his drum kit. The fact that the angle on Henley is almost always the same makes it seem like the video focuses too much on him, whether it really does or not.

Although I'm a big Eagles fan, I can't recommend this DVD to anyone.",1243296000,4,1530,4.339160839160839
8327759,4,B001NPUIYE,I FIRST BOUGHT THIS SHOW AS A BOOTLEG AND THE QUALITY WAS PRETTY POOR. WHEN I SAW THIS RELEASE I QUESTIONED WHEATHER THIS WAS THE SAME SHOW. IT WAS BUT THE QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER. YOU CAN STILL TELL THAT THIS PRO SHOT SHOW IS A BOOTLEG BUT NOW WATCHABLE. THE CONCERT IS A NICE SNAPSHOT OF THEM IN 1995. THE CONCERT ITSELF IS VERY GOOD. WORTH THE MONEY.,1243296000,3,352,4.115942028985507
