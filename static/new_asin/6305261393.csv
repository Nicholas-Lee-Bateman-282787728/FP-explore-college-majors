7886334,4,6305261393,"Previously, I've only thought of Tzu Hsi as the old imperial Empress Dowager who ruled China for a half century.  ""The Lover of the Last Empress"" is not a Chinese action movie.  It's a drama chronicling the rise of Tzu Hsi from imperial concubine to Empress.
There's a lot of sexual content.  But the story is of a concubine whose role was to be a sexual object of the emperor.
Tsu Hsi was probably one of the most ruthless women in history.  She was the mother of the new child emperor, when Emperor Hseih Feng died of illness at an early age.  But Emperor Hseih Feng's edict left the regency to eight trusted advisers and empowerment of his widow Queen.  Also the late Emperor Hseih Feng's brother Prince Kung had the military power in the capital.  The concubine Tzu Hsi overcame them all to rise to Empress.
The movie only deals with the rise of Tzu Hsi.  As a historical note, Tzu Hsi is said to have murdered her own son in order to retain power as regent by naming a child successsor.
There is a lot of bad translation in the movie.  I had to rewind some of the dialog.  But it is a good movie about the subject.
A good companion to this movie is a two part Chinese saga dealing with the same subject, ""The Burning of Imperial Palace"" and ""Reign Behind the Curtain.""  The latter two movies were made in the early 80's.",1014508800,16,1325,4.323886639676114
