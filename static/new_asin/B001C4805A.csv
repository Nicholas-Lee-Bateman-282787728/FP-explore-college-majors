8285828,3,B001C4805A,"William Klein is sort of an acquired taste. He is out there on the edge in that he made movies in the late sixties that have the feel that they could have been made yesterday. The amazing thing about Klein is that most people have never heard of him exceptin the context of his documentary on Mohammad Ali. His first fiction feature the  oddly titled Who Are You, Polly Magoo takes a scathing look at the world of high fashion.

Polly Maggoo (Dorothy MacGowan) is a bucktoothed, freckle-faced American girl working as a model in Paris. She is all the rage, the fantasy girl of the faraway Prince Igor (Sami Frey) and the obsession of television reporter Gregoire (Jean Rochefort), who is filming the gamine for his journalistic personality show Who Are You?. In between this fantasy figure and this supposedly grounded intellectual is a whole culture obsessed with Polly, fashion, and the new. The film begins with a fashion show where an avant-garde designer (Jacques Seiler) displays his new line of dresses made from bent sheets of aluminum, and the influential magazine editor Miss Maxwell (Grayson Hall) declares that he is magnificent and that he has reinvented the concept of woman. Apparently, the entire female gender was out of date.

Klein uses Polly to take stabs at the entire fashion industry and at culture in general. How can such a culture have any real meaning if it is based on such a vapid ideal. Some may find Klein's take on fashion as simply pointing a camera at ourselves. We see the world as Polly sees it. Her photos are really a mirror into our own souls.

The film is really a series of sketches, some more brilliant than others tied together by the flimsiest plot structure but oddly in retrospect it all seems to work. As part of the Eclipse Collection we get no special features but it is a joy to at least see such an obscure film in a decent transfer.",1339372800,6,1884,4.631736526946108
