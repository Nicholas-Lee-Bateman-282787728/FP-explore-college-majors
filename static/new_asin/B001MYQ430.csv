Robbins only briefly introduces the viewer to the complex concept of the outwardly absurd Policy (or CEDA) Debate competition in the college circuit, introducing champion teams from Harvard, Berkeley, Michigan, and Dartmouth. Yet, through an intense sequence of interviews with high school, college, and veteran debaters - he challenges them to invoke their feelings and aspirations, giving the audience a perspective on their humanity. He shows how brilliance, and youth is absorbed into the pursuit of victory; later reflecting on post-graduate retrospective regrets and personal growth.

Like any person experiencing their first CEDA debate, arguably the most contentious form of competition debate styles, the process can seem foreign. The camera crawls towards a debator ""spreading"", literally spewing his argument negating or affirming government policy change at 350+ words per minute, reading evidence off of cards. Later rounds, they ""cross-examine"" the evidence, opposing teams speaking over one another viciously. Robbins doesn't break down the intricacies of the process, but rather opens the question of its purpose, and its effect on the lives of those involved.

Is debate the search for truth? Should government policy always be determined by what delays the end of the world? Is it a casual sport or game, like basketball or soccer? Robbins delves into these quandaries showing how these individuals discover their own values and sometimes -- themselves.

For a concise explanation of Policy Debate (what cross-examination is, scoring) as well as tournaments and how the Copeland Award is determined, there is a decent explanation on Wiki
