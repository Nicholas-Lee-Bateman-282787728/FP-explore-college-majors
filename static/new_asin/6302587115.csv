8174715,5,6302587115,"I have always thought  Kriss Kross were the cutest little boys and ""Jump"" was a rap that I loved to hear and I think everyone liked to jump to. After twenty years later, children that were not born, love the rap ""Jump!""  Kriss Kross has a legacy that will live on for years to come with the baggy pants, backward baseball caps, and those cute rapping voices.  I love the video, ""Totally Krossed Out World,"" because it brings back memories of the early1990's. I am still jumpin' to Kriss Kross!",1372550400,,493,4.455555555555556

it's 20 minutes of rare concert footage from Atlanta and then 10 minutes of music videos.

""The Way Of Rhyme"" sounds like the track is being played and the live lyrics are muted out.  It's either really good vocal skills or what I'm assuming.  It's hard to tell.  This is actually one of their music videos that you can find easily anywhere if you want to see what the beginning of the video looks like...

They killed ""Lil' Boys In Da Hood""!!!  Probably the best performance in the video!!!

In ""I Missed The Bus"", Chris lost his voice completely. His voice started squeaking high-pitched then ""Can somebody come real fast to my (rescue)"" all out of breath on ""rescue"".

""A Real Bad Dream"" and ""It's A Shame"" was a 2 in 1 song.  One guy spit while the other guy went in the back and changed clothes.

""Jump""... what can I say it's JUMP!!!

""Warm It Up""  They warmed up the crowd then left...

after that, it was the music videos for ""Warm It Up"" and ""I Missed The Bus""

The End

I rated it a 4 out of 5 because it was an awesome concert... just too short.  They crammed as much as they could into a 20 minute slot and I wish the concert was longer.  Oh well...

Kris Kross was my nostalgia back in the day.  I grew up listening to them and they have always been my inspiration.  If you are a true Kris Kross fan, you would get this video.  It's a rare video that you probably can only find here and you wouldn't be able to download it anywhere.  I've looked around.  It was definitely worth the $3 that I've spent on it.",1266105600,2,1571,4.194630872483222
