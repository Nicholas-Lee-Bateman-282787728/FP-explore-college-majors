8022699,5,B00026L8A8,"The subtitle is accurate. the entire show is just that--eleven vulvas. But as expected, every woman's vulva is different, unique. When you've seen one, you certainly haven't seen them all. The interesting--and erotic--thing here is that these women, every one of them, are arousing themselves merely by meditation. They focus mental sexual energy on their vulvas, and most of the ladies bring themselves to orgasm without masturbation, the use of hands or any of the standard sex toys. It's a very erotic experience just to watch them in their stages of arousal.

Very well done. Kudos to Annie Sprinkle. Long May She Wave!",1428278400,4,623,5.048543689320389

8022701,3,B00026L8A8,"The title ""Zen Pussy"" grabbed my attention and as I read the back cover..quote ""every vulva is an erotic universe waiting to be explored"" I remember thinking 'how true' so I bought the dvd expecting something totally different to what I had imagined this would be about. There is no narrative, no spoken words whatsoever of any sort, not even an explanation as to what this is all about...just eleven vulvas belonging to eleven women who do not appear at all on the dvd execpt their vagina's (sorry vulvas) Im still confused as to what we are supossed to do with those eleven vulvas we see displayed quite grahpically on screen (fullscreen) you can tell the women are breathing deeply and the breathing gets deeper and louder for some as the women I assume become aroused without touching their genitals. It's as if the women are trying to breathe through their vagina's... you cannot tell which vulva belongs to whom, they all differ, size of labia, texture, appearance (some not as nice as others)some with lots of pubic hair others without...etc

In conclusion you have approximately 58 minutes of vulvas in different 'states' of 'breathing'... with some pelvic movement... Do I think seeing the vulvas was erotic?  not really... Did I gain anything from seeing eleven extremely close up views of the vulvas? not really... did I enjoy looking at eleven Vulvas for 58 minutes?...yes...bottom line? not too sure what to think. I gave it 3 stars cos' I love vulvas and thats it...",1176595200,49,1480,4.822834645669292
