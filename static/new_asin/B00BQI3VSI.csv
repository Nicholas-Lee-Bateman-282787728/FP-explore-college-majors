5665437,4,B00BQI3VSI,"Anyone who likes horses will definitely appreciate both the story and scenery.  Unfortunately, it skips their rescue from the Russians by order of General Patton, the story of which is covered in Walt Disney's ""Miracle of the White Stallions"".",1384387200,,243,5.230769230769231

5665440,5,B00BQI3VSI,"Great PBS documentary detailing the life of the famed Lipizzaner stallions of Austria.  Incredible photography shows their training in beautiful detail.  If you love horses, you will love this video.",1374624000,,199,5.6

5665443,5,B00BQI3VSI,"I checked this out from the library last week.  The video quality is extremely good on a 46"" LCD TV, using a blu-ray player which upscales DVDs.  I think most people would be satisfied with the video quality of the DVD, if you want to spend a little less than the blu-ray.  The show has several segments showing what the horses do, both in training and in performance in the authentic performance arena.  You get to see how they raise the foals to be both strong and easy to work with.  The only thing missing, it seems to me, is a discussion of the brands on the horses (I believe they freeze-brand them today).  If that was in the program, I didn't catch it.  There's lots of slow-motion footage of mares, foals, and untrained young horses running in the mountains - gorgeous panoramas - really impressive on a high-definition TV.  This would make a great gift for any horse lover.",1372032000,,883,4.475

5665488,4,B00BQI3VSI,"Good documentary.  Bought it after my 8 year old and I read White Stallions of Lipizza by Marguerite Henry, since I figured it would be a great visual followup.  Somehow I ended up watching it alone first, and I am glad I did.  They do not just talk about studs and mating to maintain the integrity of the breed.  They actually film the meeting of a stallion and a mare and their copulating - not just a flash on the screen but the entire act - while uniformed attendants stand by.  I am a physician and have no problem talking about sex ed, but I also know my son is not quite ready for this piece of cinema.  Felt like I was watching horse porn for those few minutes.",1430956800,5,669,4.147286821705427

5665519,5,B00BQI3VSI,"After reading the book, Lavender Field, that bases its story about the Lippenzer horses, I wanted to know much more about the hands on gentle training these fine animals receive.  Read the book then see this movie.  Explains much and lets you see the book through this visual eye.  I saw them in performance once when they came to the US and very much appreciated the subtle footwork of the horses and the riders that almost invisibly guide them through the dressage, ballet, work that they do.  Have fun reading the book and watching this wonderful movie.",1419379200,6,556,4.701030927835052

5665539,3,B00BQI3VSI,"Interesting short documentary on the wonderful Lipizzaner stallions. I was hoping to see more on the training techniques used to train these magnificent horses, but no such luck. The film focused on the sensationalism world of the Lipizzaner royalty and not the  actual breed of horse itself. I wonder what happens to those unfortunate foals that are born without perfect confirmation, curiosity, and talent. What becomes of them? I'll have to keep wondering, because the movie didn't go into detail about it , besides where the horses spend the first four years of their lives. It wasn't even clear as to what age they were weaned.",1416355200,7,632,4.962264150943396

5665558,4,B00BQI3VSI,"Very nice. Some inaccuracies. The techniques have been written down but like learning any complex task, they must be practiced under the eye of a trainer/instructor. I was also saddened to not see any mention of Gen. Patton's role in saving the mares near the end of WW II.

5665597,4,B00BQI3VSI,Beautiful- but maybe due to time concerns much was left out of the Lippizaner story. Ending very abrupt but this was a pleasant viewing experience.

5665598,5,B00BQI3VSI,This film does a great job of showing the life/ training of Lippizans. The bond between the handlers/ trainers and the horses is very clear to see as well.,1402876800,,155,4.379310344827586
