3428576,5,B001993YCM,"With Season Two under production in the UK, Sarah Jane, Voted Doctor Who's favorate Companion even over Rose in a recent DWM poll is shown in her first successful TV series.  Telling stories worthy of Doctor Who's current series the show was aimed at the Dr's original target group Children. The shows are a bit younger in the writting but still have the quallity that have marked the New series of Doctor Who. The improvements to the Silveen are out of this world I love the Thin Suits. After the Adventures of K-9, a Girls best Friend went flop, for lack of story more than any other reason in the late 1970's, we all thought Sarah was gone, wrong, she's back, and shows no sign of leaving us soon. She has stated she feels her time of visiting the Doctor is done following the final show of Season 4 of Doctor Who, however she is still going strong her, and the new producer is looking to bring K-9 back intothe stories more in season 3, so watchout more are comming.

3428577,4,B001993YCM,"The Doctor Who Invisible Enemy / K9 set that is just on its way out, contains ""K9 & Co."" the introduction to K9 mark III. and the Christmas special that didn't fly as a Dr. Who spin-off in the 80's. But leave it the 2005's DW producer Russell T. Davies to get not one but 2 spin-off successful off the ground (both are working on season 2's as we speak, well...""read"").  The continuing adventures of the best companion in the 40 years of Doctor Who...in my humble opinion...Elisabeth Sladen still has ""IT.""  Having see loads of space and time travel following her first meeting with the 3rd Doctor in Time Warrior (who she immediately assumes is the root of kidnappings she's investigating) they soon become the best of friends and a team to continue into his 4th incarnation, then later meeting the 5th, and most recently the 10th in School Reunion revealing what happens to a companion who is ""left behind"" by the Doctor. She's witnessed the creation of the Daleks, she seen plenty with the Doctor. Her individual adventures show to be well, ""spooky"" for having traveled with the Timelord, maybe having lost some humanity (like Rose's mum suggests is happening to her), but she grows over the course of the SJ Adventure series (and the Season 4 finally).

The monsters of the series, some old, some new, some new and old, are okay...interesting and benign enough that there is no true horror, as Sarah's companions are barely in jr. high, it seems inappropriate for the danger to be to much...but the stakes do get pretty high over the course of the series, building to a climax of planetary proportions....and super cameo at the end (no not the Doctor!) The SJ Adventures' TARGET AUDIENCE is neatly below Dr. Who's family audience, but with enough scares to make it work for the being the sofa crowd. My 6 year old was hooked, less so with my 10 year old, both who love DW (old and new), and they understand the SARAH JANE was my ""ROSE"" and that connection with it's roots means plenty. So as a stand alone project...I'd say 3 stars if fair...but if we evaluate it as fans (and parents), I'd make it 4 stars. which if pretty good for a fledgling series and a spin-off no less.....plenty that's cringe-worthy and not enough of the ""TIN DOG"".

There's also some nice links to the Season 4 of Doctor Who....like Luke's origin and the Time Beetle from ""Left Turn"" is a minion of a creature faced by SJS in her initial season here.

One Question....does this set include the pilot special ""INVASION OF BANE""
which was released by itself on DVD, atleast on region 2. I'm assuming what is considered season 1 is including the pilot. If anyone knows for sure please add a comment.",1217548800,22,2675,4.611344537815126
3428578,3,B001993YCM,"""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" is a spinoff from the BBC's ""Doctor Who"" series, targeted squarely at children over five.

It's decent entertainment for the target audience.  You'll be hard pressed to find other live action adventure shows that will give a child in the target age range as much satisfaction.  Still, the series is very uneven.  They have writers and directors who are trying in earnest to produce something of quality, and they have writers and directors who are saying ""What the heck, it's just for kids, don't worry about it being logical.""

As an adult viewer, there is much here to make you cringe.  Occasionally, the series will throw you a bone, but for the most part, it's a hyperactive little affair.

You will see many reviews giving this five stars.  You can disregard these.  They are, to the one, written by ""Doctor Who"" fans who want to promote anything having to do with their favorite show.",1216944000,15,918,4.7594936708860756
3428579,5,B001993YCM,"The longest running female character played by the same actress, Elisabeth Sladen, in BBC History.

Sarah Jane Smith is a character from the long running TV Series 'Doctor Who', she was his most beloved companion, and a fan favorite. Sarah Jane traveled with the Doctor from 1973-1976;1983;2006;2008, and has met various Doctors (1st-5th;10th)and various companions (Susan, Victoria, The Brigadier, Harry, K-9, Tegan, Turlough, Rose, Jack, Martha and Donna) along the way.

Sarah Jane was considered the Doctor's bestfriend, and even at one time voted the best side kick by TV Guide, beating out Burt Ward as Robin from the 1966 Batman series.

Sarah Jane was given K-9 Mk3, in the original spin off series 'K-9 and Company' (1981), as a gift from the Doctor. Sarah later appeared with K-9 in the 20th Anniversary episode 'The Five Doctors' (1983)
After a break from the TV screen for 10 years, but featured in various novels, Sarah Jane would return alongside the Brigadier and the 2nd Doctors former companion, Victoria Waterfield in 'Downtime'(1993).

The New Series of 'Doctor Who' returned in 2005, and Elisabeth Sladen was again asked to reprise her role as Sarah Jane Smith alongside K-9 in the episode 'School Reunion' where she met the 10th Doctor (David Tennant).
This spawned another Sarah Jane spinoff 'The Sarah Jane Adventures'. Sarah Jane is given a son, who was created by the Bane mother in 'Invasion of the Bane' (2006), which she name Luke Smith. Together they shared, which can only be described as a series of 'classic era Doctor Who' adventures.

Sarah Jane and Luke Smith returned to 'Doctor Who' in the 2008 2-part series finale 'The Stolen Earth/Journey's End' in an attempt to help stop the Daleks. K-9 was given a brief cameo in the end.

The Sarah Jane Adventures proved so successful that it was given the green light for a second series which begins in 2009.

A surprise announcement for the series, was that another former friend of Sarah Janes and the Doctors, would be returning to series two, again played by Nicholas Courtney, fan favorite 'The Brigadier'.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-Warrior-Episode-70/dp/B00114XLYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Time Warrior (Episode 70)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comeback-Sarah-Jane-Smith/dp/1903654920/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comeback (Sarah Jane Smith)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sarah-Jane-Smith-Adventures-Sarah-Jane-General-Kudlak-Action-Figure-Set/dp/B0016MAJCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures Sarah Jane & General Kudlak Action Figure Set</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Second-Series/dp/B000JBWWP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Complete Second Series</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Invisible-Enemy-K9-and-Company-A-Girl-s-Best-Friend/dp/B001AGXEBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Invisible Enemy/K9 and Company: A Girl's Best Friend</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Brain-of-Morbius-No-84/dp/B001C71IGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Brain of Morbius No. 84</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Five-Doctors-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0017XOFGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Five Doctors (25th Anniversary Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Planet-of-Evil-Episode-81/dp/B00114XLZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Planet of Evil (Episode 81)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sontaran-Experiment-Episode-77/dp/B000KGGIRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Sontaran Experiment (Episode 77)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Robot-Episode-75/dp/B000QGE8II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Robot (Episode 75)</a>Doctor Who - Genesis of the Daleks (Episode 78)Doctor Who - The Hand of Fear (Episode 87)Doctor Who - The Ark In Space (Story No. 76)Doctor Who - Pyramids of MarsK-9 Remote Control Dog",1216944000,142,4341,7.956611570247934

3428999,5,B001993YCM,"Sarah Jane was always one of our favorite Dr. Who characters. Watching the first season of the ""Sarah Jane Adventures"" has been a delight! We saw very few of the episodes when they were shown on BBC TV, and were very glad to have a chance to see them now. And to have the program be included in our Amazon Prime membership made it possible to watch the episodes now!

Granted, Sarah Jane may have been created for a more juvenile audience than Dr. Who, but that has made it no less worth watching. The characters are a combination of joyous and inquisitive -- and they face serious threats, both personal and to the world and the universe as a whole, with not only humor but also ingenuity --  elements that are hallmarks of the Dr. Who stories.

Overall, the adventures of Sarah Jane and her extended family of friends is a lot of fun. Enjoy!",1471392000,5,843,4.391025641025641

If you're a Dr. Who fan, you'll just love this take for the younger crowd. This was the first time I was able to see Season 1, so I had missed the introductory episode that sets up the series.  The kids are great. The ""creatures"" fall a bit short of the ones on Dr. Who but are great fun.

I appreciate that the writers were associated with the Doctor Who series and that they incorporated our favorite Doctor Who villains.  The Sara Jane Adventures is obviously aimed at a younger crowd so it does not have as hard an edge as Doctor Who.  If Elizabeth Sladen had not unfortunately passed away in 2011 the series may have gone on longer.,1468454400,,526,4.623655913978495

It is geared towards a younger crowd than Doctor Who but it has a lot of the same feel. Something bad is happening, lets figure it out, almost die and then save the day at the last moment. Wheeeeee.

I haven't finished all the episodes yet but I like how connected the main characters are. They feel like a family. With Doctor Who, you get attached because you can't help it but you always know that they will be gone someday with someone else taking their place. This doesn't have the built in heartbreak and I appreciate that.",1461024000,4,701,4.223880597014926

3429531,5,B001993YCM,"I want to let everybody who considers buying this first series of ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" that they need to make one other purchase before starting to watch.  The show started as a New Year's Day special called ""Invasion of the Bane"".  That is also available through Amazon.  This story gives the childless Sarah Jane an adopted son named Luke.  ounding out things are Maria Jackson and her estranged parents across the street.  The character of Kelsey used in the special does not carry on to the first series.  To replace her, they came up with character of Clyde Langer.  For those not aware, the late Elisabeth Sladen played journalist Sarah Jane Smith, one of the longest serving companions to the Doctor on Doctor Who.  The character was introduced in ""The Time Warrior"" that introduced the Sontarans and named the Doctor's home planet as Gallifrey.  She stayed through the story ""The Hand of Fear"".  Sarah Jane appeared in ""The Five Doctors"".  Years ago, the BBC tried a spin-off called ""K9 & Company"" with Sladen to showcase the character's popularity.  The special never went to series.  When Sarah showed up in the Doctor Who Series 2 story ""School Reunion"", also with K9, a Sarah Jane special was green lit for New Year's Day 2007.  When the special actually became a series, the alien Slytheen family have taken over a British public school.  When reading the episode synopsis for the first two part story, Amazon incorrectly calls the Slytheen an alien race.  They are a nasty bunch from another planet.  We will meet another alien family from the same planet in a later season.  Amazon needs to correct this error as if they had never seen the three Slytheen Doctor Who stories that preceded it.  The Slytheen would be back again.  The second story ""Eye of the Gorgon"" deals with some very unpleasant nuns hiding a Gorgon.  I found that story somewhat boring.  The third story ""Warriors of Kudlak"" made me think of old movie ""The Last Starfighter"" with video games being used to recruit Earth kids.  The Kudlak aliens looked very stiff.  In probably the strongest story ""Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane"", the alien Trickster fools around with Sarah Jane's childhood where Sarah Jane was killed as a girl from a fall that previous had killed her friend Andrea Yates.  As Andrea gets a a chance at life she never got to live, Maria has to find a way to bring Sarah Jane back from a limbo.  You really feel bad for Andrea thanks to the performance by Jane Asher.  The final story of Series 1 ""The Lost Boy"" gives background on Sarah Jane's super-computer Mr. Smith as it teams up with more Slytheen to harness poweres Luke possessed.  It is a nice cast and the adult actors as much to the show.  That is all I have to say on this season.",1451433600,13,2752,4.651452282157677

3429534,5,B001993YCM,"I was saddened to hear that the great Elisabeth Sladen had passed away. She was a remarkable actress and all I can say to her and her family is my condolences. I had not heard the news until scrolling thru Wikipedia. I also learned about Nicholas Courtney's passing. Also very sad.

But this first season was fantastic. The introduction of the new characters and Bubbleshock drink and Maria Jackson and the cloned boy who would be named Luke made the series for me. The writing, production and editing of this series was top notch. I like how they spent most of the time developing Maria in the first few episodes as we already know Sarah Jane and what she does from her long stint with Doctors Three and Four as well as her previous appearance on the short-lived series K-9 & Company. This allowed the series to grow on its own without being forced on us.

The addition of Clyde Langer sealed the show's stellar cast. All of them work well together and I can honestly say this series has grown on me. I'm so glad that I decided to buy the DVDs. Thus far I've seen the first two seasons and I'm going to start the third season by Monday. If you like Doctor Who I can honestly tell you that this is a show that will grab and hold your heart. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.

It was a BBC children's program, but I found it to be much better than the drivel they play on Nicklelodeon, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel or other cable channels.  The acting and storylines were more mature for what is suppose to be a children's program and actually could be a primetime show in the US.

I saw most of the other episodes and seasons that were available on Amazon Prime and was happy to watch most of them so far.  The last season is currently not available and the principal actress, Elizabeth Sladen, passed away in 2011 from cancer.

By episode 3, I could tell the characters had found their rhythem and were going through the story line nicely.  while the series is pretty good, it still leaves quite a few wholes to be filled and comments on my part:
Who is Sarah Jane? That is still somewhat of a mystery.
Why does each episode seem to be child focused?
What happened to some of the characters we were introduced to in the first few episodes? Will they be returning?

Well,Elizabeth brings that same drive and energy to this new series as she did more than 35 years ago, when she first joined up with the good doctor. The years have also been very kind to her, as the energy she puts into the role has not diminished in the least. Not many actors can say that.

I mean, it is Sarah Jane Smith, hubba-hubba, but you may find some parts just too silly or unrealistic.  Yes, I said unrealistic while talking about Doctor Who - what am I thinking?

But this series is something the new Doctor Who isn't. It's a tween show. When Doctor Who first came out, it was intended for the younger audience. As it went on, it went beyond that.

While the plotlines are somewhat juvenile this puts the show light years ahead of United States shows geared towards children that look for excuses to be idiotically infantile.  The stories are I think true to the sprit of Doctor Who.  My only two points of contention would be the amount of time Sarah Jane Smith (an otherwise extremely strong character) spends pining for her days of adventure with the Doctor.

I'm sorry I thought the entire point was that humans being humans could solve there problems on their own?  5 whole minutes of every episode is devoted to a doctor anecdote.  The other problem I have with the show is that every single plotline either extends to mind control or the end of all life on earth as we know it.  However this I can attribute to younger kids needing to believe the characters are in constant danger in order to remain interested.

Admittedly the 1st two stories (invasion of the Bane and Revenge of the Slitheen) are sort of weak which is why I gave this set 4 stars but as the series progresses the stories definitely improve. I especially enjoyed Eye of the Gorgon and Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?

Another thing I love about this series is the main heroine is a single middle aged woman. That's something you don't see every day.

3429687,4,B001993YCM,"Doctor Who was once a happy romp through history for the children.  Nothing too scary, nothing too complex, nothing too controversial.  At some point, perhaps Tom Baker, Dr. Who became something not accessible to children.  A little too scary, a little to adult. Targeted to older teens.  As one commentary on Doctor Who mentioned, there is certain expectation when you put a girl in leathers on TV after the football.

I enjoy The Sarah Jane Adventures because it harks back to that time when Doctor Who was suitable for children.  Certainly the new updated Doctor is targeted to older teens and adults, while Torchwoord is strictly not in prime time.  It is nice to have balance.

What I don't like about the Sarah Jane Adventures is that it falls all too often into that most wicked formula of the monster of the week killed by magic.  Doctor Who was on some level cerebral, and it would be nice if problems were solved by ingenuity and not by magic.  It is the sonic screwdriver issue.  At some point the plot devices get in the way of the story.  One plot device, such as the TARDIS, is tolerable.  Multiple plot devices can be overwhelming.  Sarah Jane is the original  plucky, bright girl.  She does not need Mr. Smith to solve all her problems.",1219968000,19,1252,4.597285067873303

Taking place alongside the latest episodes of Doctor Who are the adventures of investigative journalist (and former Doctor's companion) Sarah Jane Smith, her adopted son Luke, and young neighbors Maria and Clyde.  Aliens are falling to Earth every day, Sarah Jane explains, and it's up to people like them to help the good ones and protect the planet from the bad ones.

Most live-action children's shows seem to be the afterthought of their writers and producers (and actors), but the Sarah Jane Adventures is produced with as much sincerity, intelligence, and wit as its parent show.  One wouldn't expect such high quality from a show mostly starring child actors, but Yasmin Page (Maria), Tommy Knight (Luke), and Daniel Anthony (Clyde) are natural actors, believable and fun.  The adults aren't just there for a paycheck either: Elisabeth Sladen is superb in her latest portrayal of her classic character, Sarah Jane Smith.  Joseph Millson is both charming and protective as Maria's dad, Alan.  Even Chrissie, played by Juliet Cowan, is interesting in her minor role.

Mixed in with aliens and spaceships are more adult themes, such as Sarah Jane's loneliness, Alan's struggles to protect his daughter, and Maria's perspective of her parents' divorce.  But the show is never bogged down by them, portraying a world infused with optimism and adventure, where games turn dangerous, but everybody makes it home in the end.

8272905,4,B001993YCM,"The show is more hammy and repetitive than Doctor Who, but it still is (mostly) a wholesome delight.  Sarah Jane and Luke are generally good examples, but some of the other main characters can be shallow and disrespectful to authority figures.  Themes include the main one: antiviolent messages (but using force when necessary), and also whether or not expanding your trust circle is a good idea when things get tough.  Sometimes I feel like yelling at characters that could have so many problems solved if they would just trust others!  Even others that aren't perfect and might be heavily disliked, even hated.  I understand that this problem may have been kept so that the main cast wouldn't get too bloated, but it can be jarring to see characters make the mistake of not trusting the right people until it's too late.

I haven't gotten into Season (Series) 2 yet, but I'm worried that the show will continue to stay repetitive and a good deal shallower than Doctor Who.  Now, Doctor Who sometimes doesn't rein things in enough, but this show is guilty of holding the reins too tightly.  Doctor Who, overall, is a better show.  Nevertheless, this is consistently good entertainment and may be worth a watch with the family.",1518825600,,1227,4.804761904761905

8272909,5,B001993YCM,"Campy sci-fi designed to appeal to all ages.
Sarah Jane Adventures is rooted in the Dr. Who mythology. It is possible to enjoy this show without knowing your Who and about Sarah Jane's Adventures with various Doctors. Possible. However, at least a passing knowledge of Dr. Who and Timelords is probably best.

Sarah Jane Adventures follows the tradition of later Dr. Who shows to have inventive non-phaser and non-punching solutions to problems--although earlier Doctors did punch problems away on occasion.

Sarah Jane builds a pseudo-family of teenagers to help her protect London and Earth from galactic threats.

Not the best effects, but the character development and story building overcome the campiness.",1506384000,,711,5.387387387387387

I wasn't sure if I was going to like the Sarah Jane Adventures as much as I like her character from Doctor Who series. After watching Invasion of Bane, I was harpooned into fan hood! It is young audience friendly with a whole lot of action. Looking forward to watching the rest of the Seasons.",1497744000,,368,4.426470588235294
