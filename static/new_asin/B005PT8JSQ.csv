8482656,5,B005PT8JSQ,"This movie provides insight into the educational process, how teachers can improve, and how educational failure is most often related to political meddling and the ineffectiveness of school administrators.  Our society likes to blame teachers for classroom failure while ignoring the ineptitude of school and district leadership.  The greatest need in our schools is higher accountability for administrators.",1399075200,,408,6.017241379310345
8482657,3,B005PT8JSQ,"I'm glad I only paid 2 bucks to rent this movie. It was focused solely on teacher's becoming National Board certified, with little emphasis on the complexities of teaching. It had some good points but as usual, the message was that change is totally and exclusively dependent on teachers. The problems in education are simply not that simple.",1361577600,,342,4.913793103448276
8482658,5,B005PT8JSQ,"I was introduced to this film when I myself began the process towards National Board Certification (and recently achieved) also in Phoenix, Arizona, and was so glad to see the film available on a DVD!  Watching the film is not only an emotional journey, (not only reflecting on my own journey, but re-living the journey through the shared experiences of the teachers in the film), but also an opportunity for others to understand what National Board Certification is about, as well as a critique of systems that are in place in many schools and districts that are not providing the kind of professional development that is sustained and results in change, and leadership decisions that all too often come only from the top down.  I highly recommend Mitchell 20 to anyone who cares about education, and especially to policy makers.  Kudos to all of the teachers and principal featured in the film, and kudos to the AZ K12 Center for supporting National Board Certification.",1355356800,2,972,4.914634146341464
