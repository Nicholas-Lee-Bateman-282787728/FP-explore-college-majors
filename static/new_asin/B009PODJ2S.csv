5360695,5,B009PODJ2S,"Don Currie's new DVD, Focus Movement Faith, instructs its users in the Churchill method of wingshooting. Like other DVDs from Sunrise Productions, this one features the attractive EYE-Cam, which allows viewers to see the target just as the shooter does. This is an excellent instructional format, and there are plenty of quality EYE-Cam shots, in a variety of presentations, to satisfy the patron who likes it ""realistic."" And who doesn't? The DVD also includes a bonus section on Currie's preshot regimen (OPTIMAL Process). Earlier sections cover important basics like gun fit and eye dominance, and the entire production is conveniently divided into chapters.

Currie's secret to success is the Churchill method. Robert Churchill preached that hitting a moving target was optimally achieved by focusing on the bird and allowing the subconscious to determine forward allowance and placement of the muzzles. A number of contemporary luminaries in sporting clays advocate variations of the Churchill doctrine. Although the method of achieving lead differs with each (pull away, swing through, etc.), they agree with Churchill that barrel awareness is the bane of wingshooting and must be overcome at all costs. Instead, only the target is worthy of the shooter's complete and undivided attention.

Currie, himself a Churchill purist on focus, seems to be flexible in his method of applying lead. For example, he advocates swing through for rising teals, but, for long crossers, he prefers pull away. Regardless of the system, Currie assures us that he has no conscious awareness of the muzzles at the moment of discharge--and neither should we.

An extremely helpful feature of the focus principle is his emphasis on delaying hard focus until the clay nears the break point. Currie calls it ""timing your focus."" Other instructors, however, emphasize intense concentration throughout the clay's flight. Although this is intuitive and works well on quick shots, targets that seem forever airborne are a different matter. As Currie explains, intense concentration from the start on these and our eyes will tucker out just when they need to be at their freshest. Currie develops this important concept and reinforces it throughout the DVD.

The second step in his system is movement. Here Currie discusses and demonstrates things like gun mount, shot planning, and break point. These mechanical and sometimes tedious components of sporting clays are, nevertheless, important to the success of the entire system, as Currie emphasizes.

The final ingredient of his system is faith, which ties in directly to the first step, focus. Since our natural tendency is to look at the barrels and check the lead, it takes faith to abandon this inclination, maintain focus on the clay, and trust our subconscious. But how does one obtain this faith? Incrementally, according to Currie. Faith in our instinctive ability to calculate lead grows and accrues with each successful shot. Therefore, success here, like anything worth achieving, will require patience. Nevertheless, watching Currie break targets--effortlessly, I might add--also helps, as his faith has a contagious quality to it: ""Hey, maybe I can do that.""

Five stars for this gem from Sunrise Productions.",1356912000,8,3251,5.364705882352941
5360696,5,B009PODJ2S,"There were so many instructional DVDs to choose from. I am 100% pleased with my decision on Focus Movement Faith by Don Currie. My first impression from the quick sample video was that Mr. Currie's presentation was clear and easy to understand. After purchasing the DVD, I realized that my decision was the right one.

Well Done. Very well done.

I look forward to Mr. Currie's next video.

5360697,5,B009PODJ2S,"Don's DVD is simply the best I've seen regarding simplifying shotgun shooting.  The novice shooter will learn correct shot-gunning fundamentals and the experienced shooter will certainly improve their scores by employing this technique.  I highly recommend Focus, Movement, Faith to anyone that wants to consistently hit more targets and simply have more fun shot-gunning; after all... that is the point!

5360698,5,B009PODJ2S,I moved up in class to the point I was non-competitive.  In researching DVDs. I settled on this one and I wasn't sorry.  It promoted the Churchill method in a way I could understand and practice.  My scores went up and I continually refer to this DVD before I go out to shoot.,1355875200,2,276,4.169811320754717
5360699,5,B009PODJ2S,"Don's new DVD Focus-Movement-Faith is based on the Churchill method of instinctive shotgunning that has be around since the 1950's. He does an excellent job of explaining the concept and showing you how to apply the technique to sporting clays. He will show you how to shoot with your subconscious rather than conscious mind. You don't see the gun, just as an outfielder doesn't see the glove when catching a fly ball. It is a very powerful concept and it works! Just like everything else it will take some effort to master, but certainly worth the time.",1355875200,2,554,4.721649484536083
5360700,5,B009PODJ2S,"Mr. Currie's DVD is an easy to follow step by step guide to shotgun shooting with the emphasis on shooting as much as theory.  Mr. Currie talks you through the shot then shoots the shot.  All we have to do is repeat the process at the range and isn't that the fun part of learning anyway! And by making use of the Sunrise Eye Cam all the targets are clearly visible as they travel to the break point.  This feature is not available on all clay bird shooting videos.

As a certified Sporting Clay instructor myself, I always recommed this DVD to my students no matter whether they are beginners or advanced shooters. Mr. Currie's simple to follow shooting process makes my teaching job on the range much easier.",1355875200,2,710,4.48062015503876
5360701,4,B009PODJ2S,Helpful and well produced training video.  Don is a solid instructor but I have not yet caught on to his advice to focus only on the clay and have faith in instinctual lead.  I will keep watching and practicing and see if I reach a new level.,1412121600,2,242,4.127659574468085

5360704,5,B009PODJ2S,"Don does an excellent and enjoyable demonstration on how and why Churchill's instinct method of crushing clays works!

Wonder why you miss the target in the last 2/10ths of a second?  Is a sustained lead or passing through the bird the best?  Are you tempted to try the latest and greatest light gathering front sight ?

Don 's DVD combined with Sunrise Production's Eye-cam answers these questions by showing you how to crush clays consistently

It's hard to not understand that message.
Watch a segment, go shoot.  Watch another segment, go shoot....and you continually improve. Can't say anything more.  Yeah, it's very good.",1388448000,3,430,4.8493150684931505
5360707,5,B009PODJ2S,"I purchased the Video ""Focus, Movement Faith"" at  a side by side shooting tournament in North Carolina last Spring.  I am coming to shotgun shooting ""late in life"" after years of experience with rifle and pistol shooting.  I find myself having to unlearn everything I learned in a lifetime of target pistol shooting; starting with ""focus on the front sight"".

I have been searching for a video that will help me.  The video ""Focus, Movement Faith"" is the BEST video that I have encountered on the sport of shotgun shooting.  It simply is an outstanding reference manual.  It is jam packed with facts and information.  I do not feel that a person can absorb all of the information in a single setting.  I sat through the entire video and now find myself going back and studying individual sections.  There simply is too much information in the DVD to absorb in one setting.  The fact that I am using this on a continual basis tells me that this is ""money well spent"".

The material is well organized and presented. I feel that you went to a lot of effort to organize and present the material.  It is easily understood.  I applaud your effort and this is one OUTSTANDING DVD that I will refer to continually during my efforts to improve my shotgun shooting.  This is the FIRST DVD that I would recommend to anyone wanting to improve their proficiency at sporting clays.  I shoot skeet and feel that the techniques present in your DVD have application to the sport of skeet shooting and wobble trap.

I feel so strongly about this DVD that I would tell anyone: "" if you can only afford one DVD: this is the one to get"".  Super job!",1377734400,6,1628,4.517123287671233
5360708,5,B009PODJ2S,"As in any muscle memory sport or activity where you have to rely on training to carry you though, there are three things you can do: 1. Practice. 2. Practice. 3. Practice.  But to make those sessions on the practice field more valuable, and if video instruction could do it all- Don's would be the one. It has in depth analysis of the method and the variables.  There is a lot of material covered, but it is a useful tool to help bring your clay shooting together, and you can go back time and again to remind and reinforce what you are trying to learn.

All my time in the military was I hit what I pointed at......lead was hard for me. I found this video and things started to click for me! I still have a long way to go, but I am making the improvements needed to improve.

I've learned a lot already.  More importantly, I am certain I will learn more with every watching, and undoubtedly become a better Sporting Clays shooter by being committed to Mr. Currie's Focus, Movement and Faith.
