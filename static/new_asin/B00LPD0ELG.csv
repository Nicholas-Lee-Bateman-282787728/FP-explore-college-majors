6497818,2,B00LPD0ELG,Just another long drawn out scared teens running through rooms to room - disappointing,1424908800,,86,5.214285714285714
6497819,5,B00LPD0ELG,"It's easy to write this movie off as another ""me too"" trespassing-teens-find-angry-ghost horror flick, but then you'd be missing out on one of the most socially and emotionally important horror movies ever.  We start with a look into the building's past as a correctional facility for young boys, many of whom are gathered around to watch a fight.  Next we jump to a young woman, our plucky protagonist Heather (or was it Sarah...?), crying over a breakup.  Already we see the conflicts that end life side by side with the conflicts that create life.  It isn't long before Sarah gets a call from her best friend, Ashly, and what follows is one of the most remarkable, subtle and illuminating discussions on love and relationships I have ever seen on film.  To paraphrase Ashley, ""Love transcends all physical forms, and it matters not who you love, but how you love"".  Simply incredible.  Filled anew with the light of youthful avidity, Sarah agrees to meet Ashley and an old flame, Danny, who is ""looking really good"".  The profundity of what they are doing contrasts nicely with the films apparent vapidity in gross style, (seemingly) asinine  characters, and thin, boring plot, and this battle between style and substance emboldens the film's theme.

The characters meet soon after.  The attraction drives them to such ecstatic heights that they abandon the rational world altogether and decide to embark on a journey to the eponymous Preston Castle.  It may bother some that they don't make their reasoning explicit, but it's important to understand the movie as a surrealist trip through the mind of young adults navigating the turbulent waters of deep intimacy and the subsequent interpersonal and inner-personal - they don't need a reason because in a way, we all go to ""Preston Castle"" as we grow up.

Inside Preston Castle, Danny tells Ashley and Sarah ghosty folk tales, and the lot take turns pretending to scare each other in the maze-like inner workings of the long abandoned building.  This is the last our characters see of their childhood, frolicking about in naivety, unaware of the unseen dangers all around them, and while they have fun in each others' company, before long it's time for Sarah and Danny to ""get down"".  Ashley, being the third wheel, excuses herself to the next floor up where she merely listens to the sounds of passion.  Almost as soon as our couple thrust themselves into adulthood, the building becomes alive with activity, not all of it from the living.  A conflict long past, the residue of strife long past, or the ghost of a young boy murdered by his fellow inmates - call it what you will, but the director's choice was clearly to juxtapose the tension that mounts between people as they try to come together in intimacy with the clash of violence that breaks them apart, and how both can come up from the past to affect our present and future.  The rest of the film has Ashley trying to work her way back through the upper floor back to her friends, along the way trying to process her own feelings (which she takes out on Sarah before the ghost takes his aggression out on her).  Sarah and Danny fight their own battles, clearly being chased by the ghost of the building's past and their own.

Belying this stale, formulaic and poorly shot indie horror movies is one of the most serious and adult explorations of our lives as lovers and fighters, and ultimately comes to show that there is little difference between them, because it is the mysteries lurking in the dark that will devour you in the end.  I strongly recommend this movie, but be careful!  It is not just background noise to be played while clipping your toenails or braiding your cat's hair!  The subtle nature of the film demands your attention, because if you're not focusing your intent on the symbols, you may find yourself put off by the wooden acting, silly visuals, and nonsensical dialog.  However, if you pay attention, and if you have a keen mind for this sort of thing (as I so obviously do), you will love this movie from beginning to end.",1424563200,4,4063,4.746799431009958

6497822,2,B00LPD0ELG,"Just another boring, cliched, micro budget, b-movie ""horror"" title to throw on the ""pass"" pile. No scares at all. I do have to fairly say that the acting was moderately good, but other than that you will just find yourself with yet another dull excursion into the home movie/found footage genre set in yet another cliched location (mental hospital, prison, castle, abandoned church... take your pick)...",1416528000,,403,5.121212121212121
6497823,3,B00LPD0ELG,"When I first read the premise for A HAUNTING AT PRESTON CASTLE, I was ready to roll my eyes and sigh.  The overall concept is not a new one by any means, and some fans of the horror genre might even say it has been overdone to the point of absurdity.  But, ever the optimist, I decided to give this on a look anyway; after all, sometimes you can find a true gem amidst all the duds, right?  Unfortunately, this film does not bring anything new to the table, nor does it even shine among the hundreds of haunted-building titles on the market today.  Even so, it does have a few scares and some intensity that carries through to the end.

I was hoping this film would be much more than it is.  Sadly, its just a rehashing of the same things weve already seen:  teens go into a building rumored to be haunted, bad things happen, the lights go out, and then everybody disappears in one way or another.  Thats pretty much it.  Granted, thats the formula for MANY horror moviesbut I am looking for something more unique.

A HAUNTING AT PRESTON CASTLE is shot well for the most part, however I do have to comment on the not-so-subtle use of zooming in on two characters while they are in the middle of their dialogue.  Im not sure what the reasoning is behind this, but it happens several times in the film.  If its meant to be artistic, its notits simply annoying more than anything else.

The acting is so-so, with a mediocre cast that cant decide whether or not to like each other.  I think this is my biggest problem with the characterizations.  At first, they're all buddy-buddy.  But when they reach the castle, the two girls quickly turn into hateful wenches, while the guy turns into a piddling wuss.  This complete reversal made me go Huh? and then lose all interest into whether or not the characters survived.

The special effects in A HAUNTING AT PRESTON CASTLE are not too bad, although they look cheap in certain places when compared to other films.  Still, they are a big reason for the few jump-scenes that occur.  I actually smiled once, after one of these images startled me when I wasn't expecting it.  This small fright was a nice break from the tedium of watching the characters bicker at each other.

A HAUNTING AT PRESTON CASTLE is nothing you have not seen before if you are a horror fan, and the few surprises it does contain are not enough to carry it as a heavyweight fright flick.  While its not the worst film Ive seen this year, I am not recommending it, unless this kind of movie is your thing.  It is available now in a variety of formats if you choose to take a chance on it.",1415750400,4,2601,4.382045929018789

6497924,3,B00LPD0ELG,"Martin Rosenberg and co-writer Peter Bailey give a great ghost story using a very creepy, and spooky urban legend, and real life scene of tragedy as the location for ""A Haunting At Preston Castle"". The story arc, back story, and characters are well developed, even though they are your standard tropes. This is an indie horror so the film quality, although above most low budget horror, is stripped down. It is also a well produced horror with most of the scenes playing out in convincing manner, with creepy, shadowy backgrounds, typical spooky sounds and expected cheap, shock-thrill effects for sudden scares. The cast give authentic, fully committed performances of the three teens fated to fall victim to one evil, vengeful spirit. Of course the real star of ""A Haunting At Preston Castle"" is the real life tragedy of this haunted location-Preston Castle.

The effects are standard, low-key visual effects and spook gimmicks like falling objects, creepy sounds and characters that seem to freak out uncontrollably over everything! The CGI ghost effects are disappointing, and the entity doesn't spend nearly enough time on screen. The death scenes are pretty much off camera and only revealed during, high emotion, theatrical moments that give the last character standing some real horror to freak out over. Most things are cookie cutter moments that only give small amounts of chills and thrills. The film does have a nice pace that builds some suspense but the pay off isn't quite intense enough to give any real fright-filled moments.

Overall ""A Haunting At Preston Castle"" only offers a slightly above par horror movie experience. Everything is all been seen and done many-many times before, and we don't get the pleasure of seeing the kills take place. Bummer! Still it is a cool story, on level with past paranormal horrors such as ""Boo"" and ""Death Tunnel"". Plus the whole story around Preston Castle and the urban legends that formed after the tragic events is a great vehicle for this traditional 'ghost adventure gone wrong' tale. Even though the ghost is a weak and under-used part of this ghost story and you can guess just how the film will end long before the last act, ""A Haunting At Preston Castle"" is a nice spooky time killer.",1444867200,,2249,4.962864721485412

As near as I could tell if people if people had died in the castle it was from boredom. All they do is walk around with a camera and flashlights, its like a ghost  hunter show: the keep saying did you hear that, or feel drops in temperature. Even the sex was boring.

The acting is the only thing that made me give it two stars, Liz (Mackenzie Firgens) is great, well, not so much in this movie, but she does her best (which is more than most movies like this can say).
Absolutely horrible script.  Here's a few gems to help you decide : ( "" Oh my god! did your mom tell you this?"" ""Wait til i get to the scary part"" ).
(""Things aren't right!"" ... ""Like what?"" .. ""i don't know... like... moving things! doors!"" )

Also the volume control of this movie, is terrible, you have to keep adjusting volume on your tv, i just ended up turning on closed captions because i got tired of having to strain to listen to them talk at ""normal"" volume, then a few minutes later having my dog wake up from the random screaming, it IS a horror movie, but if you cannot hear them talk at a normal volume, then extremely loud yelling, you would be annoyed too!.
The crew just needed to get their stuff together, camera's reflecting in windows, almost constantly, stand slightly to the left please! The camera work was decent, it just got annoying when they put the typical ""Bars"" on the screen to show that one of the characters is filming themselves or what they see, i'm pretty sure the drastic camera style change would have tipped us off, but eh.

Three buddies get together to go to a haunted building and the girls instantly turn on one another and act catty while the guy becomes the biggest wuss, ever. *yawn* The back story on the building was contrived but somewhat interesting; I would have actually enjoyed watching the back story more than the real time/modern story! The building was presented as a maze that is easy to get lost in, in the dark, and that played fairly well - lots of twists and turns and unexpected hallways. Not much of a plot, here, either.

6498175,2,B00LPD0ELG,"I watched the entire movie... no wait, I did not watch the entire credits at the end which last over 3 minutes. Really. Over 3 minutes.

But even with those very long credits, it is unfinished. If you want to ""see"" the movie without watching the movie, just read the title and description. You have your 1/2 movie and I am being awfully generous to say it is 1/2.

Stop reading if you don't want a spoiler (but how can there be a spoiler if it's not a whole movie?)

Hah, that's the spoiler. No resolution. The viewer is just left hanging, almost literally when the end credits begin.

2 Stars because it wasn't horrible enough for me to stop watching, though this one came close. Each segment made me keep watching for something to happen. That's something at least. The acting was B+ to A- for this type/style of a 1/2 movie. Acting wasn't very challenging, so it was hard to see if there was/is true talent.

This is not worth the time.",1426550400,6,939,4.373563218390805
