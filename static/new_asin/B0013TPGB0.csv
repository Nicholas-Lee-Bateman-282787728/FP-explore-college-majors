But bye & bye, the movie was a funny indie effort that been overlook. Hmm, hmm, hmm, beware of Oops, LOL! :-)",1458259200,,257,4.16

Plus you learn more about being a player here than you do in Def Jam's How To Be A Player. Derrick Simmons not only directs Jump Offs but he also stars in it as Malik/Oops as well as narrates the whole movie. Oh yeah, there will be spoilers in this review so please don't read if you're planning on watching this movie.

Jump Offs details the lifestyles of 5 different players. It shows how the lives of these players are affected by the choices they make whether right or wrong when it comes to choosing women. Its shows different ways that these guys can handle their situations.

I'll tell you what I like about as well as what I don't like about it. Oops is pretty funny as as well as being a jerk at times. I can't believe for a second that these gorgeous sisters would even hook up with Oops much less give him the time of day with his messed up teeth. Oops looks like Martin Lawrence's character with the screwed up teeth from Blue Streak. The game show skit was pretty humorous. Once they showed the baby with the jacked up teeth, I had to catch my breath because I was laughing so hard. The DL player part was hysterical too. ""I really like you"", ""Yeah I really like you too"". ""No, I mean I really like you"" Huh?"". It was a silly scene but it managed to get a few chuckles out of me.

There are a few things I didn't like about this movie. The scene where Oops pays a friend of his to rob his car with his baby mother still in it doesn't sit too well with me. This scene was in bad taste and should have been left out. Also I have been to different areas up north like All 5 boroughs of New York, Trenton and Newark New Jersey and Boston and never came across girls that was as courteous as the girls in this movie. I know that not every girl from up north are snooty but to make it seem like every girl up north has common courtesy is being unrealistic. Especially when those girls are well-mannered towards Oops and that is pushing it. Any girl from New York would have shooed him away without a second thought. The self-loathing Kenny character was WAY over-the-top(think Uncle Ruckus from the animated show The Boondocks only younger and more reprehensible). Im not sure what purpose his character serves besides being despicable and wearing his self-hatred on his sleeve. It gets uncomfortable to watch him mouth off to pretty black women because they are not as sick-minded as he is. Also how is it that Bryant gets the hell beaten out of him and Kenny gets kidnapped after mistreating his girl when he finds out she's mulatto but Oops never gets what's coming to him? That doesn't sit too well with me either because out of all those guys that deserved what they got Oops never gets his comeuppance.

Despite this rough spots Jump Offs is not that bad. Its not great but its good and some effort was put into this movie. Plus I like the message about cherishing the woman that loves you before you lose her permanently. Plus any movie that doesn't have me checking my watch every second can't be that bad. Only recommended for those that aren't snooty to a fault and can look past its flaws to enjoy it for what it is.",1237075200,5,3293,4.306451612903226
