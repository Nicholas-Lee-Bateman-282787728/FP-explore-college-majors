On top of this, I found it difficult to do Solid Gold Cardio on carpet, although I am used to modifying the moves to carpet. You'll also need more space than with other DVDs, even cardio ones.

Petra's DVD includes more ""workout""-type exercises in very simple combinations.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Very high TONING: Good to very good (there are several special toning segments)  CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Intermediate, not because of the moves themselves, but because of the speed and the turns INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Good MUSIC: Good FUN FACTOR: High once you master the moves

SAFETY
Be careful with your knees, since this is more a high impact workout at full speed.

CONTENTS:
- Extra quick warm-up - Christy basically takes steps from the first routine to warm-up and includes a bit of stretching. This section is really small but effective. I do not need it when I do the cardio workouts in this DVD, but it's useful for other DVD's that do not inlcude a warm-up or  when you only do the toning bonuses of this DVD.
- Two workouts each consisting in four small choreographed routines that are afterwards strung together to form each of the two full 4-part workouts. When I say that each routine is small, it's not in terms of duration, I rather mean that each consists of just a few different moves, that are repeated over and over. The first routine in each of the workouts includes something like a brief warm-up.  I consider the workouts very tough in terms of cardio (you are jumping, kicking and turning all over), although you can choose hi or low impact, the low impact modifications are shown by four girls at the very back and you mainly see the front three girls jumping like crazy and distracting you from the modifiers, so you basically start jumping with them.
- Movemaster (slow explanation of the individual choreographies)
- Choreography 101 - This is a 20 min. workout in itself, in which Christy explains the basic moves included in any choreography (like step-tap, ball-change, grapevine, chasse, kicks, hamstring curl, lunges, etc.) and how they are modified by trainers to get ""pony's"" and other moves and even how they add extra flair to them with arm movements, etc to form a floor aerobic choreography. This was interesting, although I knew the steps from the workouts I had previously done, it was nice to have them ""taught"" to me.
- Cool down - This is a dancey cool down in which you lower your heart rate
- Extra Stretch - These are excellent stretches
- Several toning bonuses each one taught by a different trainer of those that accompany Christy in her main cardio workouts. (abs, squats & push-ups, balance ball, back & buns and pilates).

MUSIC:
The music is very good, but I think the selection and blending into the workout is not as good as that in Funktional Fitness. The volume of the music compared to the instructor's voice is perfect to let you enjoy the music and exercise to it while still hearing the cueing.

EMPHASIS:
The emphasis of course is strong cardio, but since there are several bonus segments included, it's also a good toning DVD for your legs, abs and buns.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ FUN: Working out with Christy is fun, but you need to master the moves in this one to enjoy it.
+ Cardio and toning mix
+ Choreography 101 (this is more informational and you will probably not use it often, but I had never seen a section like this).",1392249600,,4289,5.098290598290598
8082360,5,B000B69TDM,"If you are into strictly floor aerobics, then add this dvd to your collection!  Full workout (2 segments) is approximately 45 minutes total  but you can do each segment separately.  Each segment is approximately 20 minutes each. Great music and Christi is a great motivator!",1359244800,,274,5.044444444444444
8082361,5,B000B69TDM,"Love it!  I have a ton of workout DVD's but Christi Taylor is a favorite.  It is really challenging to keep up with the moves at first, but a solid workout even before I have them all down.  It's fast paced, fun, and really burns calories.  Even though I have all the moves down now, I still never tire of putting in this DVD.",1248480000,,326,4.046875
8082362,5,B000B69TDM,The choreography will seem too hard to do if you're a novice video exerciser or if you're not familiar with Christi's workouts. The trick is to LISTEN to her instructions rather than just trying to follow the moves. She is an excellent instructor and I was amazed at how quickly I learned the moves. Uses the best music of any videos I've done and her workouts are always fun to do.,1188345600,3,382,4.394366197183099
8082363,2,B000B69TDM,"I agree with the other reviewers - way too complicated to be a good workout. She starts with what could be a great routine and then adds about a million pivots to it until all you're doing is turning in circles. I have a fairly strong background in dance. It's been a few years since I quit but I had danced since I was young and let me tell you, the years of experience were no help at all! I thought that the bonus features, which break down the steps, would help me figure it out but even there she just breezes through them! Rather than repeating a move several times and explaining what she is doing, she does it twice and moves on to the next move. After several attempts to decipher the routines, I gave up and went back to my Crunch videos (which I would highly recommend).",1152748800,,781,4.213333333333333
8082364,4,B000B69TDM,"In addition to the hi/lo workout, the disk includes many bonuses: ten minute sessions focusing on abs, squats & push-ups, back & behind, pilates, a core ball workout, and  an extended stretch. You can do the main workout, or one of the combination platters: shortened versions of the main workout, with warm-up and cool down, aerobics only, or a strength and stretch routine from the combined ten minute segments, or everything strung together.  So this is quite a versatile workout. You need a bit of floor space, but no special equipment unless you want to do the core ball workout.

 The aerobic segment is quite complicated, and I found the cueing confusing (too early). Christi has three people demonstrating the more complex movements and four in the back doing a less difficult variation, but these people are hard to see on a small screen. To help you learn the moves, there is ""Movemaster"", which goes through each move separately, slowly, and showing you what the person does from behind. This is very helpful, but the moves don't get strung together as in the main workout. Also, the DVD is NOT chaptered such that you can easily jump back to the beginning of a combination to repeat it, sadly.

  Finally, there is Choreography 101 - which takes you through all the most basic aerobics moves, naming them and demonstrating them (e.g. grapevine, side lift, knee up, etc) . This would be helpful to an absolute beginner, however, such a person has a long, long way to go before they can handle the main workout's combos and flips.

The music in the main workout is okay, forgettable pop, but not just synthesized beat as in the other parts. You cannot turn off the voice or the music as in some workout DVDs.

Overall, this is a good workout for an intermediate to advanced aerobics exerciser who likes to learn complex combos. It would get 5 stars if the moves were easier!",1149984000,5,1884,4.702127659574468
8082365,3,B000B69TDM,"I picked this up at the library, but the moves seem complicated & too step/kick aerobicized for me, very uninspiring.
I agree the best thing about this dvd is that is there about 10 or more ""extras"" such as abs, back, ball, weights, etc. in 10 min length workouts.

Too Complicated, October 11, 2005
Reviewer: TCasiello (New England) - See all my reviews
The good points about this DVD is that it has a lot of features. There is the main workout, a cool down, a bunch of extra excercises, and even a ""combination platters"" section that combines different parts of the main workout with the other excercises. There is also the ""choreography 101"" and ""movemaster"" sections that are supposed to help you learn the steps. However, the moves Christi does are simply too complicated. I spent most of my time tripping over myself trying to get the moves instead of breaking a sweat. The ""Choreography 101"" section shows the basic foot patterns, but after Christi is done modifying them in the main workout, they are unrecognizable. The ""Movemaster"" section is basically the core of the workout done a little more slowly, with no real further explaination of what she's doing. I spent a long time with the ""movemaster"" on 3/4 speed, trying to learn the combinations, just for the modifications in the main workout to trip me up. After about a week of trying, I finally gave up. So, unless you are a dancer, you might want to try a different video. There are others out that get your heart rate up as much, without the intricate spins and footwork.",1139875200,3,1685,4.750853242320819
