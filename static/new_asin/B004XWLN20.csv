4497722,5,B004XWLN20,"As my dad grew up he always did like Superman. Over the years he would see any movie or tv show that was Superman. I think I got my love for Superman from my dad. When this show first aired my dad started watching it and then he got me watching it. We would watch it every week together. Sure there were episodes that you say, What? but over all we like the show. In 2010 the show was in its last season But dad did not get to see the series finally in 2011. He past away in Dec 2010. I think he would have loved it like I did. One day a few years ago I was looking at different things on Amazon and one click lead to another and the compete box series Smallville  came up. I did not buy it right away. There were some customer reviews that gave it low marks for the box the dvds came in. The people said the dvds were hard to get out. Some of the boxes even ripped. I kept going back to it. I did order it. Yes, sometimes the dvds were hard to get out. I took my time in getting them out. Box and dvds are still looking good. I am glad I did buy this because every once in awhile I watch the complete series with great memories of watching it with my dad.",1507507200,2,1156,3.8368200836820083

4497729,5,B004XWLN20,"It is RARE these days to receive a product which FAR and away EXCEEDS YOUR EXPECTATIONS.  If you are a Superman fan, or if you liked Smallville when it was on CW television; THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DONE BOX SET.  Basically expecting ten DVD for the ten seasons in some form of box set (already OWN Blu Ray discs for Season's 7, 8, 9 and 10, and would have ordered box set in Blu Ray but not available).
What you get?
1.  Box that would look good on bookshelf in your living room.
2.  INSIDE that box are TWO Albums with unique HIGH quality presentation.  THICK PAGES with two DVD on each side (FULL Color scenes from Smallville are on each page).  There is a small velcro tab between the two dvd on each side,(**see caution note)  The Season # is in box on leading edge so you know where season begins and ends.  EACH DVD is numbered #1-#62)..  TWO ALBUMS
  FIRST ALBUM has Season #1 thru Season #5.
  SECOND ALBUM has Season #6 thru #10.
3.  STORY LINE MAGAZINE- More of bound book glossy high quality photo paper; having synopsis of each show, covering each DVD and All Ten Seasons.  This makes it exceptionally easy to follow along, go back to find favorite episodes or whatever,  Lot of material not found with 'just a DVD'.
4. Daily Planet Newspaper- haven't read yet, appears like real deal from front page.
5.  Included within package, on DVD is a LOT of extra material, look at Amazon site, or elsewhere for details; best yet- buy this set.
VIDEO QUALITY, PLAYED ON SONY MODEL 550 BLU RAY PLAYER (WHICH SUPPOSEDLY UPGRADES VIDEO TO NEAR BLU RAY) IS EXCELLENT (currently in middle of Season 8),, NO problems with any disc as yet),  Viewing on ten year plus Sony 41"" kdl model TV.. picture is excellent.  Even took out and played this DVD against Blu Ray disc in Season #7.  IF cost is not too great, am always buying BluRay,,  would have except buying Seasons #1 thru #6 separately cost more than this SET having ALL TEN SEASONS.

The set is so complete and so well done, there is a LOT of additional information even some older COMPLETE shows from DC Comics archives which haven't been played on TV ins Decades.  NOT going to tell you exactly WHAT extras. a LOT; overall this set is SO WELL DONE that I am glad I spent the money, despite the fact that I already have Blu Ray for last four seasons.

PRO:  Unless you have been sleeping, go back and reread the above.
CON: None
RECOMMEND:  YES and unqualified yes, and excellent buy, where you receive MORE, a lot more than just buying TEN DVD, especially buying ten television seasons, costing what $1.99+ /episode or $25-40 and UP for Entire Season of a television show.  Smallville has 22 episodes per season for most part.  NOT 8-13 or so which is getting far too common.

FYI: Having been getting discs from Netflix for ""Lois and Clark-Adventures with Superman"" at same time.  Smallville has a quality of  special affects and overall production quality in filming; Smallville's FX  and Film DOES make those of Lois and Clark DVD to look shabby in comparison.  Where Smallville has very well done FX that started with Season ONE and which just get better as Seasons continued.  Folks were saying 'Smallville' is NEVER going to last, and this Reviewer still remembers the negative on chances of seasons being renewed; glad they were wrong as it was great seeing these young actors growing up.
Figured out that there deal with DC Comics, didn't allow 'Clark Kent' from 'Smallville' to don the famous Superman Blue suit with 'S' & a Red cape.  Read followup material to get answers to those questions later.
Does TOM WELLING BECOME SUPERMAN?  Buy the set, watch and enjoy journey to see if it happens.

Surprised the producers and financial folks behind Smallville didn't get behind a Superman movie with Tom Welling; the characters doing Green Arrow, Aquaman, and more would make an excellent Justice League movie.  What were you folks thinking- unless they couldn't get Tom Welling who did every show for ten seasons.  ?

WHO: No, not affiliated with seller or anyone else- just a satisfied customer; and a Reviewer has been around nearly seven decades,.. don't read comics any longer, who doesn't watch 'cartoon movies' or the adult animated movies.. we'll see enough of that as Graphics Cards, GPU and Computer tech continues to grow,,, never could have done Spiderman or many of Marvel shows and made it believable,  You need a story and needs to be well done to be enjoyable for an adult.",1504224000,,4457,4.612452350698857

4497735,5,B004XWLN20,A million stars for the show and 2 stars for product packaging. 2 because of neat packaging but the cardboard easily scratches the discs and makes the discs skip. VERY FRUSTRATING. I feel like that should have been fixed after all these years and people complaining about that,1494201600,3,276,4.770833333333333
4497736,5,B004XWLN20,"This is one of the best series out there, a real gem. It's lots of fun and exciting to watch, but still asks the tough moral questions about what it means to be a hero, or even, a decent human being. Each character has character development that is a pleasure to watch over the seasons. I particularly enjoyed Clark's parents, especially the integrity and character of his father. Other characters that stand out are a phenomenal Lex Luthor who really struggles with his identity and tries to fight the unwholesome influence of his father, in a mirrored situation to that of Clark's. There are a lot of moments of tenderness and humility, warmth and humor in this series.

That said, don't buy the box set. I bought mine in 2014, and it took me until mid-2017 to play all of it. In that time I found that 4 discs didn't work. I never even scratched them- they were simply defective from the get go, on the first playing. I have never had such quality control issues when purchasing DVDs. Thankfully I had already seen the episodes I missed when the show aired on tv... but I ended up buying a replacement disk for one of them on ebay, and since 2 defective disks were from series 6, I bought the whole series to replace the defective disks. The last defective disk was the second bonus disk- I can't find a replacement so I don't know what I missed...

All in all, since this is 10 seasons and therefore very very long, it will take you a while to get through them all, and by the time you do, it will likely be too late to return the disks when you discover they are defective. I couldn't bring myself not to give Smallville 5 stars in the rating because the show itself deserves that. But I would give ZERO stars to the company that manufactured and sold me a set that contained defective disks!!",1493683200,9,1798,4.396396396396397

He doesn't become the official ""Superman"" until later seasons but its a must see so you can understand his origin and how he tried to live a normal life. You see him embrace his destiny as he grows up and matures over time.

Loved Tom Welling *SWOON* ;) best Superman actor to me (followed by Henry Cavill of course lol) and Michael Rosenbaum as Lex!! My favorites were also Erica Durance as Lois Lane and Allison Mack as Chloe! Wish Clark and Lana had less time in the series, I always felt that was dragged too long, and that Lois and Clark relationship was too rushed and not shown enough, since they were destined to be together. Once Lois and Clark got together, that's #RelationshipGoals ;)",1485993600,,795,4.482758620689655

And that's something you have to remember about this series.  It's the story of Clark Kent, not the story of Superman.  If you're looking for Superman to appear, you will have to wait until the very last episode.  I'm still more of a Marvel fan than a DC fan, but Smallville has a special place in my heart and I was so incredibly sad to see it end in Season 10.  My husband and I do own this entire series on DVD and we have nearly worn them out, watching and rewatching it.  And this is really the best way to watch all the episodes consecutively.  I know the reruns are on cable from time to time, but it hasn't hit Netflix yet (what's up with that?) and is not available on the CW app either.

4497762,3,B004XWLN20,"This tv show is good, but it doesn't hold up well to binge watching.  The writing gets noticeably repetitive when watched back to back.

The DVDs seem to be high quality video and well organized.

However the packaging is truly terrible.  The worst I've ever seen.  It is 2 books made of super thick structural cardboard.  That makes it too large to store normally, heavy, and it risks scratching the DVDs.  There was even book glue on some of the DVDs.  The packaging weighs 4 times what the DVDs themselves do.  The first thing I did was carefully remove the DVDs, inspect them, pick off any glue, and put them in different case.  Some were a bit marred, but I don't think too badly to play.  This 72 dvd case worked well for me as replacement storage.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005ATMC/",1483315200,,793,4.666666666666667

I watch the show on a Blu-ray player and a 40 inch LED TV and the quality is unbelievable. I've never seen a picture on DVD looking almost like Blu-ray quality with stunning crisp and clean picture. Warner Bros did an excellent job with the DVDs and the show is beautiful to look at even on bigger TVs. I've uploaded some pictures to give you an idea how great it looks. The sound is also great especially if you have a 5.1 surround system. The music and score of the show is awesome with Mark Snow being the composer of the early seasons.

The large box which holds the two hard cases of DVDs was dented badly.  Ok, not the worst thing, but then I started checking disc.  It only took pulling out the first two disc to see that they would all be scratched.  So I exchanged the item hoping for better.  Nope.  Same problems came with the next set.  I decided to check the discs, hoping that the light surface scratches would not effect overall play, but low and behold there were skips and audio problems.  Unless you have time to check 10 seasons worth of episodes, there is no telling how many disc are scratched.  To top all of that off the case is part of the problem. Dics are incredibly hard to remove and some even had what appeared to be glue.  Either the disc are being scratched in the factory or the case itself is causing the scratches.

Some episodes are freak-of-the-week type ones in the first season, and it gets a little repetitive, but sticking with it really pays off so much, you will be glad you did. Even people who hate super hero shows have come around and thanked me profusely for getting them started on Smallville.

It could have run for ten more years had only Tom Welling been willing to stay. Since there was no replacing him, it ended as the longest continuously running sci-fi series ever. I wonder how many people have teared up at hearing Tom's voice when he introduced the last episode with, ""And now - the series finale of Smallville.""",1481500800,2,845,4.552631578947368

Tom Welling puts such feeling and emotion into Clark Kent, really bringing him to life.  Smallville has people from the other Superman movies starring in here or guests appearances in the show as well.  Of course DC comics was involved giving insight.  It's pretty epic and well thought out.  Of course there are very important episodes explaining his past and who he is, as well as Clark experiencing life and life choices in other episodes.  Alot of tie in's explaining how and why things came to be when he will one day be superman.  I started renting Smallville via Netflix DVD via the mail.  I was halfway through season 2.  It was just taking too long for the turnaround time from Netflix.  I couldn't wait any longer.  I went and bought all 10 seasons on Amazon HD video at $29.99 each.  I couldn't be any more happy.  Best money I ever spent.  I still continue to watch.  Thank you Tom Welling, cast, and crew for bringing us Smallville.  This show holds a special place in my heart.

I have seen reviews saying the disks are scratched but I have not found that yet. All the disks are playing fine and I am enjoying the series.

4497803,5,B004XWLN20,"I love this set. Its put together so nicely

Yes, but the DVD slots are really tight and can damage the discs if you're not careful. One disc was damaged but I don't plan on returning it just for that.

The bonus newspaper is really cool. I plan on framing it. It looks so nice.

I wish they made a box set that included the available blu rays. When I was buying smallville I had to ask myself: ""Buy this all in DVD or buy them individually and buy the seasons on bluray""

This ended up winning. $100 for this set is an insane deal.

Edit: I've completed Season 2. Incredible show. Although the bottom of the box chips away very easily. Likely because I'm constantly switching discs every other day.

The folders themselves have held up nicely. Very durable and tight. The tightness is greatly exaggerated when you know what to expect. I can understand why some people ended up ruining their discs but there's a trick to get around the problem (if you don't mind hurting the case a bit.

Again, I really wish they made a version of this including the Blu Ray seasons. But who can argue with the 100$ price tag (now 150$, during this edit).",1465776000,5,1139,4.369668246445498

I tried a few scratched/glue spotted discs and the only issue I had was slightly fuzzy audio, no skipping problems that I have found but there are 62 discs.

4497827,3,B004XWLN20,"The show itself gets 4 stars from me but loses another star for packaging(details below)

In all honesty this really is a great well made show for any superman fan out there.  While it is very cheesy and a bit drawn out on several occasions(in the sense that people are never really as naive as they are in the show), the characters were (mostly) all cast very well for the younger action/drama audience.  As for the product itself, it loses a star because, while buying it in the set on sale is the cheapest way to watch them(unless you're pirating), the packaging is very sub par.

The box it comes in is very large(as to be expected from 10 seasons of DVDs) and is separated into two double wide books.  The part that gets bad is the way they are placed in these books.  They are cardboard booklets and while it may be glossy compared to say a shipping box, it is still cardboard and thus very abrasive on DVDs.  to get them out, you must get your fingers on both the top and bottom of the disk and squeeze hard(to keep your grip) and pull out.  There seems to be some sort of guards inside each disk sleeve to keep it from sliding out and they make it very very tight to get the disk in and out so there is always going to be friction on the bottom of the disk against the cardboard which will scrape it up.  To give you an idea, when putting the disc back into a sleeve, it will go in about 3/4 of the way and then feel like it's snagged on something or like it's already all the way in, until you give it a little more force and it pops past the inside wedges and slides into place.

In addition to scrapes on many of the discs, there have also been one or two with tiny cracks on either the outside or inside of the disc.  Fortunately these have not affected playback yet (i'm through season 4) but it's not to say they won't have adverse effects on someone else's.

If you buy this set, be prepared for the very likely possibility of returning or exchanging the set due to pre-existing  scratches/imperfections on the discs.  If these had simply been packaged as a premium product the way it should have been, and had the plastic faces where the disc could be mounted by the center hole. this would be a 4 star product. for sure",1459900800,7,2236,4.2305882352941175

I read reviews talking about how the CDs got scratched so I went ahead and bough a 64 Disc holder. The set boxes were beauitful! The pictures were so nice, and it really sucked to tear them out to get to the actual CDS. But cutting the CDs out instead of sliding them in an out, I got minimum scratchs, none noticable. A little glue on one disc, but that can be scraped off. Comes with a really cool Newspaper featured in one episode (not sure which). Loved the pictures, but they're pieces now :( tried to save them. I love the show, and to get all 62 dics so cheaply was a great deal. Just know what to expect and it'll turn out great!",1452556800,,663,4.107692307692307

4497862,5,B004XWLN20,"Box set looks great: book form. Only, packaging the discs this way leaves light scratches on the clear surface of the discs. Looks of the packaging of a box set are important, but I believe the container for the discs should take priority when it comes to protecting the discs-the main investment.

4497864,4,B004XWLN20,"I have to give this set 4 stars because it is one of my favorite shows. However it is not without it's faults as far as the set itself goes. Yes the cardboard is annoying to get the discs out of (as other reviews state) and the quality of the DVD's on new TV's is not that great. The biggest issue I have is that every disc has scratches on them already. Minor ones but still, you can tell they were packaged that way and it was NOT caused by the cardboard they are being stored in. One of the discs even had a spot on it that looked as if glue was on it that would not come off (I managed to get it cleaned off but not without a few extra scratches from doing so). Either way the show is amazing and the set is the best you'll get for the money and for the show aside from buying each individual season. If this would have been on Blu-ray I would have bought it on Blu-ray instead.",1451692800,2,882,3.9329608938547485
4497865,4,B004XWLN20,"I'd been wanting to rewatch and finish Smallville (I haven't watched the last 3 seasons) for some time now, so having extra money after Christmas, I decided now was the time to invest, so I impulsively purchased the complete series. It wasn't until after I'd placed the order that I read the reviews.

As many have stated before, the packaging of the set looks great, but it's not ideal for maintaining the quality of the DVDs. You'll absolutely want to purchase a CD case to house the 62 discs included. The cardboard sleeves of the books hold the discs snugly, so when you take them out, they're immediately scratched. Some were easy to remove, while others proved to be more difficult,  but all came out  at least slightly scratched. I checked the discs that had the worst damage to make sure they were readable in my BluRay player, and they all loaded fine. I checked a few episodes from the discs to see if there was any skipping, and other than a 3/4 second skip at the beginning of the episode they were fine. It should be noted if you rewind the episode those 3/4 seconds, it plays just fine, so it may not be an issue due to any scratches. I won't know anything further until I watch all 218 episodes, but other than scratching and the added expense of the CD case, the set seems to be great.

If I had to do it all over again, I probably would've bought each season separately and got BluRay copies as they were available, even though it would've cost more to do so. Although, at $107, and no major problems to report as of yet, I definitely can't complain.

Verdict: If you don't mind some scratches and having to pay an additional $10-$20 to store them in a separate case, the complete series set is worth the money.",1451433600,3,1728,4.421383647798742

4497879,3,B004XWLN20,"I loved Smallville when it was on air so I was excited for the complete series.

I removed two stars for the following reason:

The packaging is really bad. Yes, it looks nice but sometimes you have to fight to get the DVDs out of the very tight pressed cardboard sleeves. Do not be surprised at all that just by taking out the DVD that there are noticeable scratches. I sadly ended up destroying the DVD Sleeves that came with it and moved all the desk into a CD/DVD storage book.",1447891200,,481,4.274725274725275
4497880,1,B004XWLN20,"So I got this as a christmas present for my fiance because he used to loved this show but never got to see the last few seasons. I had read the reviews, so I knew to expect that I would have to open it and inspect the discs and probably have to have a few resurfaced. What I didn't expect was that 39 OF THE 62 were going to be scratched/have glue stick to them. I spent about 35 mins carefully tearing the middle divider and prying the pages apart to get the discs out and transfer them to another case only to find out that 60% of them needed resurfacing. From scratches that were obviously on the discs before they were put in the case, because I guarantee they weren't from pulling them out. So that's another $20 spent (the girl at Family Video gave me a discount, thankfully) on top of the extra $12 I spent on a separate case for them and the $100 I spent on the set itself. Whoever designed this is an absolute moron, and whoever is running quality control is obviously blind, drunk, or the designer's even more stupid, inbred cousin.

TL;DR: save yourself the time and buy the seasons individually. You're going to end up spending just as much when you're done with this one.",1447718400,4,1184,4.309417040358745

But anyways, I'm happy with the one I got, I didn't have that many problems with the disks being scratched, or the disks having glue on them. I did get 2 disks with glue, and about 10 disks with some scratches, they're not bad, they're just little ones, I don't think it'll be a problem. Adn as for the ones with glue, I did manage to remove the glue, but it wasn't large amounts of glue, just little drops of it. I love the box, and the design on the DVD's, can't wait till I rewatch the entire series.

Almost every disc I have pulled out of the sleeves (which I didn't have as much of a problem with that as others have) had glue on the read side. Most of them, I was able to clean the DVDs and they played properly. But I got to disc 8 and the damage from the glue was such that it simply can't be read.
I'm quite disappointed and have contacted Warner Brothers in hopes there is something to rectify the situation. Again, it's a great show, but if the packaging damages the product, then this is a big problem.",1440633600,,682,4.213740458015267

4497963,5,B004XWLN20,"One of the best Sci-Fi series' ever! This has so many deleted scenes, commentary, and etc! Definitely worth the money. Each episode is approximately 42 minutes and their are 10 seasons! Every episode is just GREAT!",1423958400,,214,4.972222222222222
4497964,3,B004XWLN20,"I thought this package was OK for any DC Comics and/or Small ville fan but I wouldn't recommend getting it even if you only have 3 seasons of Small ville in your collection. When this package came out I sold all my Small ville seasons and  bought this but I figured out it wasn't different at all and the ""added collectors addition"" stuff was cheap kind of like Halloween costumes. I had to seriously pry the discs out because they were so tight in the case and it took minutes to find a disc, you could of at least made it so it can flip open more. Maybe it was just my case and if that's true I'm worried for other people because this was a disappointment.

For those of you that are like what the heck is smallville or your trying to find out if it's good or not. Its a show about young clark kent that is still exploring his powers, for non comic fans the action and suspense will keep you going on the series while comic book fans will watch it for when green arrow comes on screen your like ""OMG ITS GREEN ARROW"" (Like, I know we have the arrow tv show but imagine seeing him back in 2008) Again the suspense and action is thrilling and the series is a roller coaster. Physical and emotional. I highly recommend it.

Before you buy this pack think of these things, just to make sure your not wasting 200 bucks.
-All 11 seasons should be at your local library
-If your not sure about it, try finding a full episode on youtube
-You can get separate seasons at your local video store and it will be worth it

Enjoy watching!",1423785600,,1527,4.201365187713311

4497987,3,B004XWLN20,"Content-wise, this title is 5-stars, within the genre.

PACKAGING IS RIDICULOUSLY DISMAL, a triumph of STUPIDITY = 0-stars.

Under what horrific sweat shop conditions are these boxed sets manufactured?

Be sure to visually inspect and test playback on all discs in this boxed set RIGHT AWAY.

I have dozens of large DVD boxed set collections. The physical condition of the discs in this boxed set is the absolute worst of them all. Nothing else comes close to how bad it is with this boxed set.

Thus far, I've gone through THREE supposedly new boxed sets of this title. Having read about problems with scratched discs, I used a pristine optical-grade microfiber cloth and clean, powder-free, surgical gloves to open the sets and extract discs for inspection/testing every time.

Discs can be reliably removed by laying down and opening the book case flat, then holding a given page at 45 degrees up from horizontal, with one hand on the outer edge of the page, while using the other hand to pinch a disc edge with a microfiber cloth and extract the disc. The weight of the angled sleeve/page will create an ever so slight sag in the page/sleeve, auto-magically freeing the pinched disc from the otherwise tight sides of the sleeve. Disc insertion is just the reverse movement. Nothing to force, nothing to pry. This worked with every single disc in all of the sets I handled.

That said...

All sets contained many egregiously scratched discs with unrecoverable read errors making the discs unplayable or only partially playable.

Almost every single disc in all three sets were marred with mostly playable micro-scratches, but in an astonishing array of micro-scratch patterns. Micro-scratches are thinner than the width of an hair and, theoretically, could be polished out using an optical-grade plastic scratch removal kit, but that would take several hours of work.

Several discs also had obviously visible discolorations of the laser-reflecting recording substrate, not attributable to obvious defects on the (opposite) label-side. The darker/discolored regions of the data-side of these discs actually contain no data in these regions, making some of them only partially playable or completely unplayable. These discs are mis-burned. There is no excuse for any mis-burned disc to wind up in retail packaging - it means there is no disc Quality Control within Warner Home Video.

Almost all discs had a thin film of adhesive residue along the outer rims of the discs. A few discs were also imprinted with smeared finger prints.

The fingerprints are from workers not always wearing gloves, or not having enough spares to change into, when inserting discs at the factory.

There was no grit or dust inside any of the cardboard sleeves.

All of the discs were scratched BEFORE they were inserted into the cardboard sleeves, at the factory. There is no way that both straight line and swirly scratches on any single disc are caused by the ridiculous cardboard sleeves. No scratches were added or worsened by extracting/re-inserting a disc from/into the cardboard sleeve.

The thin film of adhesive residue on the outside rims of the discs are a direct transfer from the overly tight sides of the glued-together cardboard sleeves.

Sliding cardboard sleeves are not the way to sell or store such a massive boxed DVD set, unless the back-side (the side touching the reflective/data side of the disc) is suitably padded with a soft microfiber material (like that found on most decent quality CD/DVD plastic mailer sleeves). Sturdy spindle mounting remains the best way to package and store optical disc media.

There is NO quality control over the discs BEFORE they are inserted into the cardboard sleeves. These discs were scratched BEFORE they were inserted into the sleeves. The mis-burned discs are inexcusable, period.

SHAME ON WARNER HOME VIDEO FOR SUCH POOR MANUFACTURING QUALITY.",1420243200,2,3889,5.107255520504732
4497988,5,B004XWLN20,"Love this. Well worth the money. Around Thanksgiving and CHRISTmas sales you can get it less than $100. I grew up watching it. Its nice to have and watch through. The box is a heavy durable material. It contains heavy duty books featuring cast photos. Beautifully done. It remind me of the days of the record books. Each page contains two discs. The discs are hard to get. The downside is that you can scratch a disc taking it out. The DVD books are heavy cardboard so they will last. It comes with a Daily Planet Newspaper containing stories that appeared in Smallville. I believe this is the Newspaper seen in the show finale. Its very cool. It also comes with a fool color book of pictures from the show and a listing for each episode. There are Two extra discs of extra features and most of the seasons contain episode cometary, deleted scenes, and documentaries on the chracters, and stories. You get what you pay for.

I bought this set after only seeing the first season so i was really taking a risk there, but it was so worth it and i loved it. The reason i give it 4 stars is because the casing is very tight and can scratch the disks. I had to return the first one because of this but amazon sent me another one immediately!!! This time i was prepared and i purchased a disk casing from target for 9 dollars and i removed all the disks carefully from the Smallville box into this new case. I now have all the discs safe for usage and the box is on display. I suggest if you buy this product to do as i did!",1410566400,3,860,3.8920454545454546

4498035,3,B004XWLN20,"The DVDs are handsomely packaged with their own case, each (of two) set in a foldout photo-album style, and its sleeves hold the DVDs;  these sleeves display pictures from the show (or just staged pictures), beautifully done.  Set has a great separate guide to each episode, but the DVDs are too-tightly packaged in each 4-DVD sleeve.  Trick is to gently pry open the center white divider, sliding your finger down that center, until the DVDs are loose.  Of course, at that point they won't hold their place within the sleeve, so you can only do this separation, once.

Else, you can't take the DVDs out of the album sleeves, without scratching the DVDs.  So think of the photo album-style package, as a remove-once holder for the DVDs, which you'll put in jewel or other cases, after initial play.  Each DVD holds 4 episodes, 62 DVDs total.  Again, handsome set, if the sleeves weren't too tight.  The albums are two, with Series 1-5 in the first album, and 6-10 in the second.  The last two DVDs are strictly bonus features, but nearly every DVD has some extras.  You can select from either English or French for spoken dialogue, and can get subtitles in English, French, Spanish, and (presumably Continental) Portuguese (or maybe Brazilian, I didn't test to find out).

The sleeve problem is FIXABLE: manufacturer can solve the problem, by making that center divider, velcro'd.  Or, maybe you can put velcro on after separation.  I didn't yet try doing that, but I did manage to put the DVDs in jewel cases, separate all three of the partitions in the album sleeve (i.e., DVDs 1-4), then hold the DVDs in the cases within the separated sleeves, by means of office-supply binder clips.  For best results so you can refit the album in the case, put the binder clips on the outer side, so the clips protrude from the case.  Thus you can still sort through the sleeves, but have the DVDs protected.  (I'm not sure how well that will work, once all the DVDs have been refitted as just described.)

There are five bonus hours included, which other reviewers have covered;  DVD #61 has some Comic-Con feature SuperBoy and Aquaman pilot, Paley Fest 2004.  Also, re 100th episode, a longer version of what's on the Episode's own DVD;  if you like seeing how movies are made, you'll like it (very long and spontaneous interaction of crew and cast, and their dedication to the show).  DVD #62 provides the backstory on DC comics, and then a kind of pastiche review of the series with 'featurettes', selections of the Episodes in the series.

Also, a sample (faux) Daily Planet newspaper, true kitsch.  The separate guide's plot summaries are too succinct, but the photos are well-done.  Pity the horrible 'Save Me' loud ugly theme music dominates when you insert the DVD, encouraging you to find the Main Menu as soon as possible, so you can silence it.  Pity also that the Episodes have that music too;  pity that they aren't categorized by season, so you must cross-reference Episode titles with something online like IMDb, to find their placement.  However, it turns out that each season has its own DVD color (i.e., Season 1 is a pale burnt orange, Season 2 a pale blue-grey), so that is somewhat helpful.

There are many other negatives:  the music is awful in every episode, either way too syrupy or way too loud and grating, especially the theme song;  Warner's idea of DVD structure is especially annoying and slow, (i.e., you cannot go directly to the DVD episodes upon insertion, but must wait for that stupid intro to play out, the Features are usually boring commentaries, and navigation is a nightmare); I really wish someone would strangle the hairstylist director (esp. for Chloe's hair).  But then, I can't stand 'teen' shows, so I'm biased.  (Heh: they admit to hairstyling problems esp. for Chloe, in the Feature for 'Exile', Season 3 commentary.)

On the other hand, the storyline is wonderfully edgy, campy, with marbled seriousness -- kinda like the balance of those three styles in the Simpsons, or Buffy.  Worth rewatching, even when way too kitschy with the superhero effects of the meteor showers on Smallville.  Bear in mind, I can't stand the Superman story, and I hate 'high school' stories even more.  But the writers manage to keep the storyline edgy enough to de-schmaltz both ideas, so you can get the larger (admittedly stereotyped) paradigm.  Starting in Season 7, the story is so unrealistic as to become campy, employing virtually every mythology in the history of mankind (including Da Vinci Code type stuff), which is clever, albeit hackneyed.  Series effectively ends with Episode 1 in Season 10.  After that, the episodes are a mish-mash, tone is much more comic-y, and the plot holes are never fully resolved.  The finale is horribly syrupy and lame, disgraces the entire series, and the writers should all be shot.  To add insult to injury, the DVD for the finale skips!  Acting remains good, however.

Themes of course are Growing Up.  Finding out life isn't as nice as you expected.  Finding truth harsh yet fulfilling.  Finding your own niche in the process of trying to absorb and relate to, the scary/unhappy facts as you learn them.  Begging the question all the while, 'Is this all there is?  Isn't there something more meaningful, and is there a BETTER life, post-death?'

Oh: and for those who would say, 'but brainout, you're a Christian!', I find a lot of Bible-related info in the series.  Which apparently is even partly intended, as beginning in Season 7, a lot of Bible references begin to be made (deprecatingly, vaguely, sometimes well-meaning).  After all, this is a show about a messiah in the making.",1409011200,2,5654,4.824324324324325

There is one thing I was hesitant about though. I'd read other reviews and learned the pages the discs are in are compact and the discs scratch if you try to take them out. When my set arrived, I figured out a way to rectify that. I didn't spend all that money to get scratched or damaged discs. So I took my box cutter and carefully split the white dividers inside the pages that kept the discs so far I could see the bottom of the disc if it was nestled inside. If they're split, they're still able to house the discs no problem and they're looser so you can get out the disc without it scratching. It doesn't do anything to the picture on the page either. I did that for all of them and it worked. I can still have the awesome box set of Smallville and no scratched discs.",1398124800,9,999,4.1020408163265305

Seasons 1 to 5 and 6 to 10. One needs to be careful in removing each disk as they are in cardboard, with a tissue slip. This could have been done with a better design, but it was packed well. The British version merely has each season packed in it's case then stuffed in the giant box.

4498088,5,B004XWLN20,"I just recently got into Smallville and was really enjoying it. I bought the first two seasons used but after seeing the AMAZING deal on this set ($110 on a limited time sale, when I got it) I jumped at the chance to own the whole series.

The set is great. The books that hold the discs are HEAVY duty and are actually very nicely crafted and visually pleasing. The included episode guide is great if you forget what episode you're on. It's set up so you can quickly scan the short summaries of the episodes and find the one you're one.

The main point I'd like to make here is in regard to the numerous reviews saying that the disc booklets hold the discs too tightly and that they're going to be scratched when you get them. While I can't speak for everyone, my discs have been scratch free so far.

Honestly, I think all the people saying that the discs are held too tightly are missing the actual design of the disc booklets themselves. It's not that the cardboard at the top of the ""pages"" is cut too small or that the slots aren't as big as they need to be. The ""pages"" seem to be made to be a sort of disc holder. From what it feels like when I take the discs out of their sleeves, it's almost as though theres a semicircular ring of cardboard that surrounds most of the circumference of the disc when it's inside the sleeve. When you go to pull the disc out, there some resistance because you have to apply enough force to get the disc through the opening at the top of the ring of cardboard that's slightly smaller than the disc is at its maximum width (almost like pulling the disc through the open end of a horseshoe).

It's kind of hard to explain BUT all that to say, this DVD set is TOP QUALITY and is one of the nicest sets I've ever bought, both visually and functionally.

TL;DR - The main reason I wanted to leave this review was because all the people saying the disc holders were too tight kind of worried me until I was actually able to handle the set myself. Don't worry about scratches or anything like that. As long as you're as careful taking these discs out as you are handling virtually any DVD, you'll be fine!!",1395619200,,2140,4.261083743842365

The book holder sleeves that contain the DVDs however, are not. In mine, about 50% of the sleeves were separated (ripped) in the middle and you could tell not enough glue had been applied.

The sleeves are far too tight, you risk damaging the disc because of this.

60% of my discs are scuffed or actually, fingernail feel-ably scratched. This is probably the worst use of a hundred bucks I could've found. I really feel sorry for all the people who paid more than I did for this.

I haven't had a moment to look into the extras bit, with the newspaper and whatnot but there's no need, I can't believe they would sell something like this in such terrible condition and pass it off as a new item. But then again, the disks were ""made in Mexico"" so maybe that's why.",1394150400,9,961,4.376404494382022

Each sleeve holds 5 seasons and each sleeve is made to look and feel like a book. Each book has pictures detailing various screens from the series. The added extras make this a great edition for any collector. However, I will warn anyone that the discs are tight and hard to get out of the cardboard that holds them. I bought a DVD book to hold the discs out of fear of scratching them.

My advice is to buy a case for the DVDs, when i got the product i removed all the disc and placed them in a case and seems to work for me; down side is that i just have that booklet where the disc where just sitting there but its fine since i just bought this series because its just cheaper than buying individual seasons. As for the series itself i highly suggest no to do the marathon because it can get old very QUICK.

4498108,2,B004XWLN20,"this review may include what might be considered spoilers, but really are just a few generalizations about the repetitive and predictable plot formulas.

the only reason it gets a ""3"" is because i like to see the comic book source material (such as booster gold, hawk-man, aquaman, mera, apokolips...etc, etc) brought to life with special effects. but he show is padded with so many tediously slow-moving scenes with annoying characters and dialogue that it probably could be shortened to 10 minutes per episode without losing anything of substance. the characters talk slowly and hesitatingly (probably in order to fill up the hour in the cheapest way possible), and in nearly every episode the plot revolves around some annoyingly stupid misunderstanding that could be cleared up if their dialogue got to the freaking point instead of dwelling on close-ups where the actors are supposedly being expressive by hesitating in their lines and staring at the other person.

nearly all the characters are unlikable because in the beginning episodes, every single week one character would encounter some superpowered thing, and the other characters not only would refuse to believe them, they would throw a giant hissy-tantrums accusing the person of making things up. even if that's believable the first time it happens, it's incredibly annoying. after the first time, when it becomes clear that super-powered things happen here all the time, the disbelieving hissyfit-tantrums become both annoying and unbelievable pathetic standard operating procedure to try to create ""drama."" stupid and lazy writing.

the clark kent character is written and acted as an intolerably annoying monotone whiner. and by the last few seasons, his breathtaking incompetence as a supposed superhero leaves so many holes in the ""plot"", you might as well fast forward to the reasonably well-done action scenes and forget trying to wrap your head around how the eventual action finally came about. because if you watch the plot, you will constantly be asking, ""why didn't clark keep an eye on this person who he knows is in danger? how did this bad guy sneak up on someone with super-senses? why is clark standing there, hesitatingly talking and pausing (supposedly to show inner emotions) while this normal human springs some trap at normal human speed?

the chloe character was unbearably annoying at the beginning, and she continued to be unbearably annoying until the very end.",1389744000,2,2454,5.236641221374046
4498109,5,B004XWLN20,I was not a Superman before this. He was actually one of my least favorite Heros but this changed it! Now the start of this series was not so good. It took until about season three to actually get good. And it took til about season seven for it to become more familiar to the way we know Clark and how he was with everyone like Lex and Louis. Overall it was great! Id buy it again!,1389571200,2,381,3.961038961038961
4498110,5,B004XWLN20,"Therefore, I am happy.

Honestly for the cost of this package one would expect much better recorded quality and a slightly better disc sleeve would also be nice. This is a nice set if you want it to sit on a shelf and look good but to watch it just pass and save hours of frustration.

4498118,3,B004XWLN20,"I have found many surprises along the way.
Packaging - As many others have mentioned, the disc storage is poorly designed - the discs are tightly packed in cardboard sleeves - I have not scratched any (yet) but I get finger smudges on each one trying to yank it out.
Subtitles - I enjoy using English subtitles and was disappointed when I started Season 5 and found that that season does not have English subtitles. Curious to see what others won't have it.
Bonuses - There are 2 extra discs, a newspaper and some flashy photos, nothing else.

Overall, worth the $119.99 I paid while it was on sale but I would have preferred to get each season as a separate set if this had been any higher priced.",1388707200,2,698,4.410852713178294

4498120,1,B004XWLN20,"Even if you love the series DO NOT BUY THIS PARTICULAR SET. ASIN: B004XWLN20

We have watched 30 of the 62 discs in this set.
26 of the 30 discs needed repairs/resurfacing before they would play.
(Remember we are only half way through the series.

Read the reviews. The discs get scratched when you remove them from the unbelievably bad packaging, making them unplayable.
So I started carefully tearing the sleeves open, destroying the storage case. This only verified that the discs were scratched sometime during the manufacturing process.

Taking them out of the sleeves the normal way does create even more scratches worse.

Next problem with this set?
Year 5 does not have subtitles in English which is important to me as my hearing is very poor.
My family and I tried to move forward with the show but I cannot understand what is going on without subtitles.
Also note that Closed captions, if they exist will not work when your DVD player, like mine, only has digital video output such as HDMI.

Update: We stopped watching Smallville when we hit year 5 because of lack of subtitles or functioning Closed captions.
I assumed years 6-10 would also not have Subtitles. I did lots of reviews and checking. Thinking that
I would have to buy years 5 - 10 in blu-ray or order sets from England or do what it took to solve the lack of subtitles.

Here is what I found, odd by true.
I have personally verified that years  1,2,3,4 have English and other languages of subtitles and years 6,7,8,9,10
also has English and other languages of subtitles.

(Oddly only year 5 does not have subtitles in English.)

I still would not recommend buying this set unless you get a deep discount and don't mind repairing scratched discs.
(Also you will need another way of storing the discs as the packaging of this set will only continue to scratch your discs.",1388361600,13,1844,4.666666666666667

4498122,4,B004XWLN20,Loved the setup of the book style binders.  Only complaint is the DVDs are so tight in the cardboard sleeves that you have to tear the cardboard to get the dvd or scratch the disc.

4498123,3,B004XWLN20,"I should state that my rating is NOT a reflection of the TV show, but instead a reflection of the way the product is packaged.  The case for the DVDs is a hard, cardboard-like case without any cloth protector to maintain the integrity of the discs.  I have only taken out the discs twice, yet the discs look as if they have been dragged across the carpet because of the hard case.  I would recommend that you purchase a CD/DVD protective case holder, or at least have the means to copy the discs to your computer's hard drive because if you continuously remove the discs from the case they will eventually be scratched so bad you won't be able to watch them any more.",1387670400,3,667,4.362903225806452

4498130,5,B004XWLN20,"So I grew up a Marvel Comics fan in the sixties.  Specifically, Spiderman.  Stan Lee captured a young man growing up trying to fit in with the crowd, which, as a teen at the time, was something I strongly identified.  The emotions of this turbulent period were so different than just a few years before.  DC comics, at the time,  seemed to be locked into the World War II era where we simply needed superheroes to take care of bad guys.  They tended to be sappy and, in the campy Batman series of the time, patronizing.  I think Smallville has been the best superhero show on TV to date.  The show developed the characters and their relationships over a ten year period in which it was obvious that they had a vision of the denouement when the pilot was written.  Throughout the seasons, the recurring theme of fitting in resonates like a Lady Gaga song.  Yes, there were some clunkers, and the meteor rock infection was overplayed at times,  but, the regular kryptonite infections were true to the comic book and inspired some pretty good storylines.  The lineup changes were particularly appropriate for a young man growing up and moving on with life.  I appreciate that the show reached out to former ""superman"" cast (especially tying in Christopher Reeve in as an important character to the storyline).  They did an excellent job of explaining the Lana to Lois as girlfriend transition and Lex's descent into evil.  It ended on a great note, and true to the promise that I understand was made to Tom Welling, ""no capes"", at least until the very last shot.  Smallville was a great show for teens of any age.

Sadly, this is not the case.  About half the discs in my set have scratches, from minor to moderate.  Fortunately they all play, but I spent over FOUR hours hand buffing said scratches.  Luckily, I know what I'm doing.  Warner Brothers should have done a recall on this set.  One of my pet peeves is how poorly manufacturers treat the all important disc surface.  I have yet to encounter a nick on the label side of any disc from any purchase, but far too often disc surfaces look like they've been used for roller skating.  This could have been a nice set, but the packaging is sadly deficient.  And I am concerned that the label side with the disc numbers are imprinted on the discs in such a way that you can actually see the numbers on the reverse side by holding them up to the light.  I hope this ""bleed over"" does not cause playback problems in the future.  Manufacturers, quit trying to be so fancy.  Just give us unscratched discs in simple packing that's easy to access.

4498164,5,B004XWLN20,"Smallville manages to reimagine the world of Superman, before he was Superman.  My version of the Box set has plastic backing on the cardboard insets to protect the DVD's and seems to protect the DVD's adequately.  It is a bit tricky to get the DVD's out by the edges, but it can be managed. For those who love Superman, or those who just love good drama, it's worth it.  Even if Lana does linger on a bit long.  Rosebaum's performance of Lex Luthor, and Tom Welling's Clark Kent really are some of the high points.  John Schneider and John Glover bring us competing fathers of Johnathon Kent and Lionel Luthor.  The extras are fun, but of varying quality, the Green arrow and Chloe Chronicles are of lower production value, and it rather shows.

All in all, worth the own.",1373673600,,773,4.517985611510792

As far as packaging, I get to some degree how people my be frustrated as you don't have of the DVD exposed to pull it out of the booklet sleeve.  However, take your time and everything is fine.  I hate when people complain about packaging and how it scratches the discs... The same complaints were made with the MacGyver box set but I have no complaints, problems, or even scratches either with that.

It was a great add to my Superhero collection of DVD's & Blu-ray's! I would give it 5 stars if the container was better. I do like that the DVD's don't fall out if the container if it is tipped over though. As far as regretting the buy or swaying others to just get the series season by season, I'll say this...I had 3 of the later seasons in blu-ray, in my hand at the local store. On sale for under $20 each, too. I put them back, waited, and found this great deal on Amazon! I read the reviews and was aware of the rubbing/scratching.

4498179,2,B004XWLN20,"DON'T BUY THIS BOX SET. BUY EACH SEASON INDIVIDUALLY, you'll save yourself a lot of frustration. The packaging doesn't have snap in dvd spots. Each page has a little folder for the disc instead. The disc folders are made of stiff, laminated paper, and they are extremely tight. To take a disc out you have to pinch it with your fingers and pull hard, which quite obviously scratched them badly. After being removed once, 30 of the 62 discs had visible damage. Keep in mind the fact that I tore the packaging to loosen them before trying to remove any of them.
The extra star is for the absolutely beautiful box it came in. While not practical at all, it's nice to look at not going to lie",1371945600,,688,4.3828125

I purchased this item as a Gold Box one day only deal for a GREAT price! Just a few days before I had found all seasons of Smallville for sale at Walmart for $14.97 a piece but when I got in my email on the day of purchase, I found an Amazon email for Smallville: The complete series at 60% off the list price. I decided to follow the link just to see what the price was exactly. Turns out, it was about $38 less than I had spent at Walmart just days before. It seemed a no brainer to me. I ordered right away and returned the 10 Seasons I had previously purchased to Walmart the same day. The item arrived much sooner than expected which was perfectly alright!

4498185,5,B004XWLN20,"In my opinion, Smallville is the best Superman series.  The characters played their parts well.  Many shows have at least one annoying character but not Smallville.  It did not push a political agenda or sexual preference.  It did not make an episode that discounts religion.  It was a great break from all the cop and lawyer dramas and silly sitcoms.  We need another show on TV like this one.  It was fun and entertainment.",1370908800,3,425,4.662162162162162

I wouldnt saying Im a big superman fan but I might call myself one after I watch this show.  I like the characters, I really like Lex Luthor on this because Michael Rosenbaum plays him perfect.  He's right on the line of being good or bad.  The effects are good and some of the action is too.  I like how the story is unfolding about Clark.  Its getting suspenseful because some characters are on the verge of finding out about Clark.  So far I give this show a 8 or 9 out of 10 but I still got a lot more to watch.  I think the set is very nice.  I like the box and the two books with all the beautiful pics.  It was in perfect condition.  The only reason Im giving it a 4.5 is because of how the discs are packaged. There are a lot of reviews talking about this and I agree.  It wasn't that hard to get them out but I would say not to put them back in because the discs does get scratched.  I bought a cd case to hold all the discs, besides that I think this is a really nice set.  I do hope a full series set does come out on blu ray sometime soon, but thise will do for now.

4498193,1,B004XWLN20,"In the beginning we had superheroes that stood for something that made an impact on comics and on film, then suddenly somewhere along the lines this awful garbage excuse for a show came and destroyed all that was good about one of the best iconic superheroes of all time to be put on the sliver screens. When smallville first started in 2001 during it's first season run it had clark on krypton as a baby for a brief moment then leave for earth as krypton was being destroyed, thus this show begins clark meets his adopted parents, goes to high school, learns about his powers that was all well and good for it's first 2 seasons but then the 3rd season came out and WTH was that this show managed to culminate into some pile of trash put together in a funnel.
Smallville the tv show is an abomination it's not the DC universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this awful tv show, i don't know why smallville is so stupid but it is and i'll explain why. My first annoyance with this show is that there's so many fictional characters who are not at all part of clark's real social circle that a lot of ignorant smallville fans out there believe to be real in the story of superman, the reason i say this is because when you read a lot of smallville blogs written with comments from the fans you'll see a lot of false facts backed up by fans of the show i.e chloe sullivan, whitney, dr. swan and lots more, i could go on and on and not to mention the stupid made up blue and black kryptonite which clearly does not exist in the superman world.
Smallville to me was always a messed up version superman's morals and character. As a fan of superman i don't mind certain changes in the story and clark does make mistakes but those mistakes are not that extreme to the point where Clark tried to elope with a pregnant Lana when she was to marry lex. Clark abandoned lois in season 8. He kept pushing lex away constantly when clark always looks for what is best in people. Clark was always depressed and obsessing over lana and all that love soap opera jazz garbage that later became this obscenity of a twisted perversion of superman, it felt like i was watching the o.c. or dawson's creek and the irony is that they all came out at the same time all in all i'd say this garbage was not designed for real superman fans at all - horrible main actor, and show all round, Avoid.",1364774400,2,2399,4.321507760532151

4498210,4,B004XWLN20,"I am an avid Smallville fan. When I received this in the mail. The box holding the disk booklets was tore at the closed end, so the booklets slipped through the tear. I used scotch tape to fix that problem, so it wasn't too big of a problem. The booklets' designs were a little confusing. The disks are held tightly in the sleeves, and if you try to hard to get one out, it may become heavily scratched; therefore, I bought a $10 disk case and transferred the entire collection to the disk case. I am fairly satisfied with this purchase because I have all 10 seasons now. So, if you are looking for the show and not the extravagance, this a great space-saving item--compared to having all 10 individual seasons.",1360972800,,711,4.435114503816794
4498211,4,B004XWLN20,"We never watched this when the series was still going but after watching a few episodes here and there on TNT I decided to buy the entire series. I did a lot of shopping around before I found this set and the price for the complete series with all of the extra content and extra memorabilia was a fantastic deal.

The series itself is well done and although it does not stick to the traditional Superman storyline it is very well done. My only complaint throughout the entire series is Clark's unreasonable obsession with Lana Lang. By season 3 I was almost to a hate level of Lana Lang and could not stand the way Clark was so willing to destroy heaven and earth for this girl. Lex Luthor and his father are brilliant in this story line. While undoubtedly the villians of the story you really grow to care about their characters and lives right along with everyone else. I loved where the story started going in the last couple of seasons and really felt disappointed that they ended the series when they were finally starting to get into the meat of Superman/Clark's story. Although this series was meant to be about Clark Kent growing up to be the Superman we all know and love, it had a lot of potential to continue on for a long time.

I know there have been complaints about the way the discs are packaged in this set. The packaging is a little tight slipping the discs in and out of the sleeves to start with but after I discovered the method to their madness of getting them out it was no big deal. I love how it is done in a book style. The only petty little complaint I have is that it does not fit on my traditional DVD shelves like all of the other collections I have currently. Which really is no big deal.

The condition of the discs were perfect and all discs played well. There was only one episode on season 3 disc 3 that hung up but we were able to push through it without missing more than a few seconds of content. That is the only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 star review.

I have recommended this set to several friends and family already and more than likely will continue to as long as it is offered on Amazon for this superb price.",1360713600,3,2175,4.246376811594203

4498215,1,B004XWLN20,"The box set was not in the best condition.  The booklet with the season breakdown fell apart soon as I opened it the first time.  The disc slots scratches each disc every time you remove or put the discs back.  A lot of the discs had dried-on glue globs on them which totally compromised disc 57 and it would not play.  Horrible design for storing discs.  Overall just a shoddy product.  Only reason it got 1 star is because I loved the series.

Each ""page"" has two DVDs in pockets which hold the disks so tightly that it takes considerable effort to pull one out -- they act as though they were almost glued in the pockets.  Without a doubt, it will take few withdrawals and re-insertions to scratch their surfaces.  To save the disks I had to spend an extra $20 to buy jewel boxes to hold the disks safely.

WB needs to get their heads out of their butts and release a Blu Ray version  of this set because they're durable (when was the last time you seen a Blu Ray scratched and GREAT quality my next one will be bought in a store, so the return will be more convenient if i experience the same results as the previous 2 smh.

4498231,5,B004XWLN20,"I won't review the show to me it's a great show and my favorite show but if your reading this then you pretty much know the show Smallville!!!!! This Review is for this release!!!!!
I love how they made this with the added exclusive bonus features!!!!!! Inside the box the two book style cases have a lot of pictures from the series and there very good quality pictures!!!!!!!! The Episode guide gives you a complete description of each episode and special features!!!!! The Daily Planet newspaper is also great!!!!! I think the Aquaman Pilot on here was really good I believe it would have made a great series the 1961 Pilot of Superboy was good too shows it on like one of those classic floor model tvs like my grandma used to have!!!!!!
Now for the issue I have is with how the DVD's are packaged they are in those book style cases and are in there very tight and it's not easy to get them out if your careful pulling them out the disc won't get damaged but the more you take it out and put it back in you will most certainly scratch the disc!!!!! So I reccomend buying a DVD Binder which doesn't cost very much to put the discs in that way you won't have to worry about the discs getting scratched then just put the box on the shelf as it is !!!!!!! Especially for how much you pay for this box set!!!!!! Now what I did is since the discs are the exact same as the individual releases just they no longer have pictures on the they have the Kryponian images on them but when u load disc it's the exact same!!!!!!! I own all the individual releases but I wanted this box set for extras and exclusive bonus features included!!!!!!!! So what I did was just left my individual relases in their cases butchanged a couple of the cases to be able to fit 7 Discs in the case so that i could put the 2 bonus Discs in there!!!!  I then took the rest of the DVD's out of this box set put them in a DVD binder took the little books out of the individual releases and sold it to a buddy of mine!!!!!!!So if you have the individual releases but u still want this do something like I did!!!!!! So you have the cool box it's contents and the 2 exclusive discs but you can make some money off it if you already own the individual relases by doing as I did and seeing if you know someone who would be interested in buying just the discs off you!!!!!! Either way if your buying this or whatever defintely buy a DVD binder to put the DVD's in to protect them!!!!! Every Smallville Fan new or old would love this release it's great accept for the way the DVD's are stored but as said the DVD Binder is a cheap remedy!!!!!!!",1354060800,,2605,4.21

4498240,5,B004XWLN20,"I haven't actually purchased this series set, but I have purchased all ten seasons in their own single releases. First off, I'm gonna give my own personal summaries of what I consider all of Smallville's 'arcs' through out the whole ten year run and then my actual review. Here goes...

The Ship Arc -- Season 1:
In a world where you stand apart from your peers and the country you live is at the brink of war, what can you do? For starters, attend your Freshmen year of high school! Young Clark Kent begins a unique adventure as his origin story commences, meeting the man whom is destined to be his greatest enemy, best friend Lex Luthor and all while trying to conceal a massive secret within a rather 'small' town. Learning from his Dad a certain secret laying dormant in the family's storm cellar, various stories take shape as Clark subtly tries fitting the pieces together regarding this hunk of metal and most importantly, where did it bring him from?

The Heritage Arc -- Season 2:
In the wake of a devastating natural disaster upon Smallville, Clark's ship goes missing after its first activation in more than a decade. Now in his Sophomore year, young Kent does more research than ever into what could be an alien background, all while love interest Lana Lang and brotherly friend Lex explore their own family's secrets. This chapter in Clark's gripping journey takes him from the town he was raised in to the roof of the Daily Planet, the highways of Hub City, and a building in New York where a very special man awaits to reveal the stepping stones in his destiny.

The Jor-El Arc -- Season 3:
Having met his biological father, Clark's fears and misinterpretation of this entity's messages lead into a downward spiral of rebellion and near madness. Only with the help and love of his Earth father can he be convinced to give his life back in Smallville another shot, leaving behind a messy life in Metropolis for his Junior year. This year more than ever, Clark learns how much a burden knowing his secret really is on those closest to him, with childhood friend Pete Ross going through his own issues, Lex experiencing a couple cracks with his mental foundation, and Jonathan Kent being warned by Jor-El's presence that it's time to own up on a deal...

The Stones Arc -- Season 4:
Following months of having gone missing, Clark's Kryptonian father has taken desperate actions with ensuring Kal-El at last initiates the destiny he was sent to Earth to fulfill. Along this rocky road for both Clark and his mother, they meet a most curious assistant of Dr. Swann's and an even curiouser cousin of Chloe's, one Lois Lane! With Jor-El's ambiguous intentions put to a stop by these various individuals, Clark sets aside his 'Crusade' and with the awakening of his Dad, pursues a football career in his Senior year. Amongst reconciliation with Lex after a brief dent in their friendship and coming to terms with Lana moving on from him, Clark gradually comes to see there may be more to Jor-El's mission for him than ruling the world, that something over the northern horizon of fate awaits him when all three Kryptonian stones are gathered.

The Fine Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 1-8):
With the construction of his Fortress of Solitude, Clark glimpses the start of a very prominent education in his life, that of Jor-El's Kryptonian Training. With his own lingering fears on Jor-El's intents still in the air and what the devastation a second meteor shower has brought to his town, Clark refuses to return in time to continue what he promised his cryptic father, having his powers stripped in consequence. During and after this mortal trial, he learns lessons about how carefully trust should be placed in others, this element leading to the definitive end of his and Lex Luthor's friendship. But what the college attending Kent has yet to realize is that a powerful force from Krypton awaits in one of his own classes, but does this artificial intelligence plan utopia or doom for his adopted home-world?

The Transition Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 9-15):
As he faces his darkest hour, Clark Kent makes life choices that will further shape him into the period of his life many normal people go through all the time, one of confusion and finding one's self. With the loss of a close loved one he had more respect for than any other, Clark must endure grief and depression, giving up college after only a semester in the wake of a crumbling relationship with Lana. In the midst of his despair, former best friend Lex has reached his own point of no return in life, the moment where one decision from him shapes the destinies of himself and all those in his life. Will Lex ultimately have innocent blood on his hands?

The Brainiac Arc -- Season 5 (Eps 16-22):
From continually visiting Metropolis to a trip down to Honduras, Clark takes a more proactive approach in letting Lana go and attempting to find the entity he once thought was a positive force from Krypton, Milton Fine. Or as he will come to learn, the Brain InterActive Construct, Brainiac. The sinister Brainiac is meanwhile on his own quest, one that involves manipulating Clark, his loved ones, even Lex into helping return Krypton's most dangerous inhabitant and an apocalypse to Earth as we know it.

The Zoners Arc -- Season 6:
In the aftermath of his very first confrontation with General Zod, Clark finds himself trapped in the Phantom Zone and the only way out may bring several lethal criminals to Earth with him, all whilst Zod wrecks havoc on Earth in the body of Lex Luthor. With the status of his Fortress in question and Lana moving into a new relationship with Lex, Clark is more confused than ever on where to head with his life, but at the same time comes to realize it's time to stop seeing Jor-El as the 'villain' he once misinterpreted him as. In the midst of all this, young Kal-El makes a very important promise to Martha and himself for where to head with his life after the Phantoms are taken care of, in addition to learning from a certain green-clad hero how much more lays in the world beyond Smallville.

The Bizarro Arc -- Season 7 (Eps 1-10):
In the battle with the final Zoner, Clark receives help from another alien hero in dispatching this Phantom-clone of himself before he can cause anymore harm. While ready to finally continue with his Training under Jor-El, Clark is given instructions on the first trial of it in which he must succeed, watching over his recently arrived cousin Kara. While Kara is busy adapting to Earth life and trying to stay out of the radar of a very obsessed and gradually more evil Lex, Lana may not be quite as dead as all previously thought, returning into young Mr. Kent's life and perhaps not for the greater good of him or the grand destiny which must be fulfilled. Only Clark himself, or perhaps two Clarks, can make the proper choices if he truly wishes to complete his first training trial...

The Veritas Arc -- Season 7 (Eps 11-20):
Having failed the trial of Jor-El's to look over his cousin and now scrambled about how to find her, Clark's Fortress Training is on hold as he struggles to see if there's anything of long term value left in his relationship with Lana, all while Lex discovers a new obsession and this time the person may in fact be whom the young Kal-El was born to become. The final steps are taken in Lex Luthor's own epic journey toward becoming the 100% evil man destined to take on Superman, but where that seductive future awaits for him, a very difficult present engulfs Clark's world as a loved one returns and another is split off. The secrets of the Luthor family, Dr. Virgil Swann, and Oliver Queen's parents may hold some most important answers for Clark in lead-up to a crumbling confrontation in his Fortress.

The Dual-Identities Arc -- Season 8:
With Lex missing in the aftermath of learning Clark's secret and the Fortress of Solitude gone, Clark is found in Russia after weeks of northern world wandering and with his powers eventually restored, thinks about the direction he wants his life to take with Lana out of it and no Training. Keeping in mind vital lessons he's learned through the prior couple months and tired by the farm life, Clark springs back into a life he hasn't had since high school, journalism! Clark Kent becomes a mild-fashion-mess at the Daily Planet, blending in the background of copy-boys as he sits across the desk from Lois Lane, as well as learning from fellow heroes how to begin the seeding preparations in a most 'Super' alias. But little does he know, a force from Krypton even more destructive than Zod lays dormant among the citizens of Metropolis, 'Doom'...

The Kandorians Arc -- Season 9:
In the midst of what the general public will remember as Superman's 'Early Years', Clark makes a most prominent upgrade to the look of his shadowy alias and while called a couple ""Blur""-related terms, begins donning the iconic 'S' on his chest with which to inspire hope. Also going back to the Daily Planet to touch back on his humanity following the dark aftermath left by Doomsday and his human camouflage, the fledgling cub-reporting Mr. Kent can't help but notice there really is something more between him and Miss. Lane. As he comes to terms with what this all means and attempts to help a few fallen heroes along the way, younger counterparts to hundreds thought long-dead on Krypton emerge through out Earth, amongst them is one Major Zod.

The Superman Arc -- Season 10:
Not allowing himself to give up after what was nearly a self-sacrifice against the psychotic clone of General Zod, Clark returns to his farm to put on a very special suit his mother made for him, this most 'Super' suit involving a red cape and the iconic 'S' emblem in full-fledge ""technicolor"". Despite being denied this glory by an unexpectedly hostile Jor-El, Clark doesn't let that stop him from changing the black colors of his continually seeding alias back to a red/blue display. Learning and touching more on the ability of flight than ever before, the growing Mr. Kent comes to gradually understand the meaning of his Kryptonian father's actions, that he has dark issues which must be put behind him if he's to transition into the hero the world truly needs. Glasses, Flights, and soon Tights... Superman Begins!

Now for the review!

SPOILERS...! Hard to believe it's taken me this long to write up a review for what is no doubt in my top three of favorite television shows Hell, it's my second favorite to be honest, right behind Joss Whedon's Angel! But without veering off topic, Smallville is a favorite and as long as you know exactly what you're getting into (which is easy now that it's over), I feel it's worth the watch.

Smallville is a unique animal amidst the various live-action incarnations of the Man of Steel, where unlike the prior movies and television shows, we get presented a 100% origin story. The emphasis in this prequel-esque scope is on 'the journey' over 'the destination' from beginning to end. In that sense, the series creators did indeed come up with their well known ""No Tights, No Flights"" rule, a self-imposed vow that ensured our Clark Kent/Kal-El character would not fully learn his ability to fly or don a certain iconic suit until the final hour of the last episode.

However, it is worth noting that while these rules are never truly broken for keeps till ""Finale"" time, they are bent in some creative and rare ways, with the show's last two and a half years even providing a representation on the early years of Clark's alias (whom yes, does eventually don a couple 'S'-bearing suits). In the midst of the character's high school years and later on into his early-mid 20s, very gradual progress is also made towards Clark's mastering of flight, compliments of roughly ten brushes with it and a few training lessons. So needless to say while Smallville is very careful from refraining into full-fledged Superman territory, I don't feel we're cheated considering (thanks in part to some future-peeks) we get just enough insight into the future we know Smallville is leading towards to see how everything will work out.

If you're a first time viewer of Smallville, I would keep all that in mind and also be well aware that it's best to look at the series as three or four separate core eras...

Clark Kent's Teen Years: The first hundred episodes where during Clark's four years of high school and a semester in college, we see the full story of his friendship with fated rival Lex Luthor in the midst of his early interpretations to Clark's Kryptonian heritage.

Kal-El's Lost Years: Between the 100th and 150th eps, this era is arguably the most stalling in regards to Clark's character, though he does make baby-steps towards his upcoming future in the midst of Lex Luthor's climatic evolution and the rebirth of the super heroes.

The Metropolis Transition: Really more of a bridging piece covering the last three episodes of Season 7 and Season 8's first five eps, this very small era in Smallville is quite literally a transition in many aspects like changes in main characters and filming techniques.

Superman's Early Years: Most likely what we'd all been waiting for since the pilot, starting with the unofficial two-parter ""Prey"" and ""Identity"" half a dozen eps into Season 8, this culminating era in Smallville spans all the way to ""Finale"" as we see the seeding of Clark's dual-identity PLUS the entire Clark/Lois/Kal-El love-triangle.

Another aspect that makes Smallville so fun, though this is mainly explored in its second half, comes in the form of the limitless DC mythos featured. You really can't imagine how many fellow heroes and villains from the comics pop up, though Batman and Wonder Woman are sadly not among them (nor the more well known Green Lanterns and Flashes), it almost becomes half a live-action Justice League series. But at the same time, the first half of Smallville is very friendly to any newcomers to the Superman story, given how very few comic arcs are adapted prior to Seasons 7-10 and the rare amount of extra heroes prior to Season 6.

Now if you are a comic fan, as I've said to many other folks, I think the best way to look at Smallville is... an ElseWorld story! Seriously, just like you would any animated adaptation, don't watch Smallville with the mind-set that it's leading into any specific Superman story that's come before, rather the only incarnation of Clark's full-fledged Superman years it is leading towards is the upcoming Season Eleven comics! Now there are some arcs adapted in prequel-esque manners ('Supergirl's Arrival' & a 'Kal-El's Return to Krypton' quickie in Season 7, pre-buried Doomsday in Season 8, various arcs like bottled city of Kandor & Justice Society's Fall in Season 9, with a couple more involving certain Fourth World characters in Season 10) while a decent deal of characters end up in desirable places by show's end.

And if you really wanna know if Tom Welling wears the full-fledged Superman suit or not, just keep in mind the ""No Tights"" portion of Al/Miles' rule, evidently they REALLY meant that part... Well, we do sorta see him in it, at least the upper half for a very few rare shots of ""Finale""! All we really don't see the actor in are the yellow belt, red trunks, red boots, or tightie-blue-tights over his legs, but please don't think that means we don't see the character fully in it! Personally, I think we got just enough, especially with Tom going the last two years straight donning the iconic 'S' on his chest (really, how many of us expected that prior to Season 9?) and even compensated for the red cape being CG in the finale by wearing one in fan favorite episode ""Dominion"".

I hope this review, however insanely spoilery it was, helped any curious newcomers and entertained any fans looking for a fellow fan's positive attitude towards such an amazing masterpiece of origin exploration.",1346284800,4,15918,4.741690751445087
4498241,5,B004XWLN20,"As a fan of Smallville, I felt compelled to write a review on not just the show but also this 'complete' series set.

Smallville is an amazing show. I'm assuming if you're here and thinking about buying this set you would have to already know that. It has everything a good show has; A great charismatic cast with great to average acting abilities which allows the cast to grow on you very quickly. It has terrific major and minor story arcs along with the 'monster of the week' formula that X-Files did so well. There weren't a whole lot of tears to be shed during the whole series but when it happens, it's the waterworks of the century, trust me. Also, I have never seen another television show that had me (on a multitude of occasions) jump up off the couch with goosebumps screaming, ""OMG that was soo awesome!"". Watching a bowling ball being thrown slow-motion through a wall disabling a gunmen was B.A and still remains one of my favorite 'Superman' scenes.  Tom Welling as Clark Kent/ Kal El was the perfect casting choice for this Superman-to-be as he was very tall, strong and handsome but was also very believable as a 'human' teenager with becoming an adult with god-like abilities. I hope for the best with the new 'Man of Steel' coming out next year and hope they take a page or two out of Smallville's book.

The show was mostly strong throughout the entire series with a few arcs that went on for far too long, but always seemed to get back on track and tidy up perfectly before the end of those seasons. I believe 8 seasons could have wrapped things up nicely if they had removed a few of the needless-long-minor-arcs and didn't stretch out the rest through the 10th. But needless to say, I'm happy with the way everything was tied up by the series finale.

Now to the review of the product.

If you want to have access to all ten seasons on DVD in a nice collector's box which looks great on any shelf, then this is for you. However, if you're wanting the 'super ultimate collector's edition' with  a lot of of behind the scenes extras, bonus discs, etc, then you won't find that. Being that it's DVD and not Blu Ray, you'll still get the low resolution and sometimes grainy scenes when the shot is at night or in a dark building. There is some bonus content on the discs, but it's what has been available for years on the standalone series discs. I would assume that since there are so many discs already, that the collector's box would be far too large for the average persons' shelf if even more were added. The collector's box is setup similar to a photo album with two albums containing the first half and last half of the show.

Because I saved 200 dollars off the original price, I'm completely content with the 140 dollars I spent. If we break it down, I spent about 14 dollars per season when a single season normally costs around 35 bucks. It was a steal in that case.

I hope this helps. Smallville F-n rocks!",1346112000,2,2938,4.437847866419295

The production values, scripts, characters, casting and dialogue make this series anthology a worthy addition to any home library.  If like myself, you are NOT a fan of Superman, per se, there is plenty here to interest you.  I particularly enjoy the numerous guest appearances by various members of the DC Universe.

Specifically, ""Absolute Justice"", an extended episode and as such,a virtual full-length movie was particularly loaded with such characters, by way of it's ""Whatever happened to The Justice Society Of America?"" storyline.  Clearly, there exists, albeit a somewhat ""made for TV"" vision, of what would be released in theaters as ""The Watchmen"".

Just no. The series finale was good, it was fine and dandy. But in the era of season or two long story lines, to go episode to episode and wrap with a three episode story arch really pissed me off. But, in all fairness, I LOVE this show. There were a few bumps along the road, but when you get into the later seasons you start to really see what punches they were able to get away with throwing. The Justice episodes were by far my best, and the Green Arrow is epic. The box set is nearly 9 Lbs. For real, this is the heaviest box set I own and it is all because of the enormous packaging. Only putting two disks per page on card stock is going to weigh things down a little. But you also get a Daily Planet newspaper and episode guide. With the set FULL of pictures and scenes, you slip wondering where is my red and blue suit? At the very end? Nope, there is no Superman shot here, which is nice because the focus was never on who he becomes but who he is now (until the final season).

The series itself only had about a single good season of episodes worth watching, maybe two.  If you put all the good episodes together that were about Clark finding out who he was and then finally becoming Superman, then 80% of the series is trash.  All the others, especially in the first half of the series, are of him saving his friends, mostly Lana Lange, who is ALWAYS in danger.  It was very irritating to see such a great cast go to waste over and over again with such horrible stories.  It got better near the end with the addition of Lois Lane, Erica Durance, who is 30,000 times a better actress and hotter than anyone else on the show.  I still felt satisfaction when he ripped the front of his shirt in the last ten minutes of the last episode and the classic John Williams score for Superman came up, but having to endure ten years of stand alone, horribly acted, episodes of nonsense was way too much.  Really, what moron would stay in love with someone like Lana, who is ALWAYS trying to get herself killed and then just leaves him anyway.

4498252,5,B004XWLN20,bluray it will be a real deal I love this show though.but I think is kind of expensive for dvd format.,1343174400,2,102,3.9047619047619047
4498253,4,B004XWLN20,"First, about the packaging. So many reviewers complained that I was worried this would be an issue. Although the packaging is atypical, its design does not damage the disks. I actually tore the package when extracting the first disk because of the cautions raised by reviewers. However, I learned how to extract and replace the disks easily with no damage. I pull the disk up 1/4 to 1/2 inch until it seems to get stuck. Then, using tissue between by fingers for a good grip and to avoid leaving skin oils on the disk, I pull firmly straight up and the disk pops right out with no visible damage. In the end, the packaging design works just fine but an insert with some pointers might have been helpful to those of us so familiar with regular DVD packaging.

Second, the media quality. Using a PS3 into a 55-inch Bravia, with digital audio from the PS3 to the sound system provides amazing video and audio quality considering how old Season 1 is. Most shows that old are not released on DVD in widescreen. The PS3 upscaling has this 11+ year old episode looking almost as good as Blu-Ray.

Third, the story. Season 1 is an outstanding treatment of the classic Superboy saga, and has great backing music. I recall my frustration as the seasons advanced that the story really didn't, and finally quit watching the show. A couple years ago, I learned that it was still on -- in its 10th and last season! And that there was going to be a 10-season release. I decided to buy the set because I haven't seen that last 5 seasons, and because I'm running out of good TV to buy.

So far, just into Season 2, everything about it gets 5 stars. July 13, 2012

Well, it's Oct 22, 2012, and I finished the series yesterday. Baseball season, ya know.
I had to subtract one star for the decline in writing, mostly in the last season.
He doesn't ""put on the suit and fly"" until the very very end, which I guess was the intention -- to show the 10-year evolution of how horned-rimmed-glasses-wearing-mild-mannered reporter versus ""up in the sky"" SuperMan situation came to be.
It could be titled ""The Long and Untold Story of SuperBoy"", or as I felt in many of the episodes, ""Clueless Clark"".

HOWEVER -- I was impressed through many of the episodes in the middle seasons how well the stories, dialogue, imagery, etc could have been so easily transferred to an actual comic book. This was very well-done and I even thought of looking for a 200-set of Smallville in comic book form.
The exception(s), as another reviewer points out, is all the teenage whining dialogue in the early episodes, and then again toward the end, all the drawn out sappy dialogue -- much of it romantic -- which lost that ""comic book"" feel which pervaded the series so well for so long.

And kudos to Allison Mack for being Clark's brains -- as Chloe -- most of the time. The voice of reason in almost every story.

Overall, I enjoyed the series more than I thought I would, given that I quit watching it on-air when the Jane Seymour sequence seemed to diverge from the story too much.

Media: The video and audio quality throughout all the seasons was impeccable for a TV show. You expect it in 2010, but it was that good from the get-go.

AND - I groaned at the constant resurrection of the Lionel Luther character. He makes a great comic-book villain -- I guess that's why. Reminded me of Syler in ""Heroes"". Indicative of writers running out of ideas.

Summary: Production Value 5 stars, Story Quality, overall, 4 stars.",1342137600,,3479,4.5342902711323765

It's a great show and great collector's item.",1341619200,,349,4.223880597014926
4498255,4,B004XWLN20,"Having been a big fan of Superman since the age of 5 I was very happy when the announced that they would be making a TV series detailing Clark Kents life before becoming Superman. It was never thoroughly addressed in the comics other than he discovered his powers at a young age so getting to see it all in action was amazing. The series had its ups and downs (the negatives were absolutely horrendous and almost caused me to stop watching about 5 weeks into season 9)but I stuck with it and was overall pleased with the series as a whole and the way it ended. I know some people complain that it was too ""modern"" and made Superman too human but that is what I liked about it, they showed that he's not just some omnipotent ruler but that he actually understands why humans are the way they are. Adding that human compassionate side (granted he was always considerate of humans) really added some depth to the character.

Enough about my thoughts on the show though, you all want to know about the box, is it worth the money? While that answer is a bit complicated...all 10 seasons with 2 bonus discs totaling around 10,000 minutes of TV. A lot of bonus features, some that were not included with the individual releases, providing some interesting facts about the series. Let's get right down to it though, as far as complete boxes go this one is awesome BUT is mainly for avid fans of Superman or just Smallville in general; casual fans should avoid this and I will explain why in a moment. Upon first opening the box I was ecstatic to see images from the series plastering each ""page"" of the DVD books. The episode guide and especially the full issue of the Daily Planet (yup, a miniature replica Daily Planet news paper) were a very nice tough but this is where the box leaves me pretty disappointed; as with everyone else I too have noticed the discs are jammed a bit too tightly in the wedges of the book pages. If you do not remove the discs very carefully (I mean VERY carefully and slowly) you risk peeling the disc labels, scratching the disc, or both. That is the particular reason I say casual fans should avoid. A big fan such as myself may be able to overlook this problem but for someone who just wants to watch the series will probably not want to struggle and risk damaging the discs especially when they paid so much ($170 when I ordered). The easiest way to avoid this problem, besides downloading the series somewhere, is to have extra case(s) on hand. When you pull out a disc to watch, rather than slipping it back in the big box, stick it in a standard DVD case till you're done and repeat the process for all the discs. This way hear you are not pulling out or putting back the discs as frequently and you lessen the chance of damaging them.

Bottom Line:
Awesome show, every comic fan needs to watch this at least once. In my opinion (that of a huge Superman fan for 20yrs now) I can't recommend this to anyone but the other diehards out there who are obsessive about their collections. The problem of the discs being damaged rather easily (quite a few of mine have some pretty noticeable scratches after being removed only once...I always make sure to check any and all DVDs/Blu-Rays I buy for disc defects before doing anything else) is just too frustrating and will leave many people wishing they had just bought the single season sets instead. I'm now left with the task of checking each disc, episode by episode and feature by feature, for any errors caused by these scratches and scuffs. A task I will enjoy so long as no issues arise...if I do have an issue it may be too late to return it to Amazon and that would be an absolute shame.

I hope this review has proven useful.",1337126400,8,3707,4.440528634361233
4498256,3,B004XWLN20,"I started watching this show based on a recommendation from a friend of mine starting with season 5. I went back and watched all the previous seasons of the show. I found the show to be interesting enough. The special effects are pretty good for a TV show. I always felt that the show was rather sappy. The dialog was alright but after a while it can get on your nerves. When I would record the show, I would sometimes skim through the dialog. Just like the original Batman movies, the villains were more interesting at times. I enjoyed the limited battles but as the series progressed, they tried to up the stakes as well as the battles. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.
I thought the series did a good job with the season ending episodes but after season 7, I started to really loose interest in the show. It really wasn't getting any better. I always hoped that some new blood would change the overall feel and tone of the show but that never did happen. The way the show always worked was they would introduce a villain in the first episode and then Clark would beat him in the final episode but with an added cliff hanger to get you to come back and watch the next season. I felt that season 8, 9, and 10 were all disappointments in the end. Even in the final episode of the series, he beat the enemy far too easily. To not give too much away, it all centered on him being able to fly and him taking on the mantel of Superman. Overall, I was very disappointed.

But I wanted to review the series as a whole. And this does look like a really nice set. I saw it in the store, and the books and pictures looked really great. I wanted it! Of course, complete series are kind of pointless unless you become a fan in the last season, or are behind on your wish list. On the bright side, I have the Special Edition of Season 8: the limited edition ""steel"" case from Best Buy!

Anyway, SMALLVILLE is pretty much my most favorite TV show ever. (It kind of ties with The Golden Girls, I Love Lucy, and All in the Family, but those are comedies, so you can't really compare.) Never have I spent 10 years - a third of my life - devoted to making sure I saw my show every week! Wow, I can't believe it was that long. Smallville drew me in from Season 1 and never let go. I'd watch it another 10 years, now that he's finally Superman, and has all those new adventures at his doorstep! The finale, incidentally, had to be just about the greatest series finale in all of TV history.

I started watching Smallville because I was such a huge fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lois-Clark-The-New-Adventures-of-Superman-The-Complete-Seasons-1-4/dp/B000HWZ4BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lois & Clark - The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Seasons 1-4</a>, which had ended 3 or so years earlier. It is so hard to choose whether Dean Cain or Tom Welling makes a better Clark Kent. They are both just amazing. But SMALLVILLE is definitely my favorite show!!

Now, I might make some people mad, but to those of you who are complaining that you already own the individual seasons and will not shell out money for a complete set unless they release it on blu-ray: stop being so spoiled. Yes, blu-ray is a very nice picture. But Smallville on DVD is hardly horrible quality, despite being filmed a ""whole decade ago.""

4498264,5,B004XWLN20,"I have read positive and negative reviews of this item.  First I want to address the lack of Blu Ray for this set.  Many fans have expressed disappointment, and the studio has given their reasons (or excuses, depending on your take) for sticking to DVD.  For me, DVD is okay because the Blu Ray player within my PS3 upconverts very well.  The quality is amazing.  Also, I can only imagine how much more this set would cost if it were on Blu Ray.

The second thing I want to address is the quality of this package.  It is absolutely astounding.  The set weighs just over nine pounds.  As previously stated the beautiful blue box comes with two beautiful hardcover books within.  Seasons one through five in the first volume and seasons six through ten in volume two.  The discs are redesigned and the pages that hold the discs are full of vibrant scenes from the series.  Additionally there's a beautiful envelope that includes an awesomely detailed episode guide full of color photos as well as a fully produced copy of The Daily Planet.  It actually smells like a newspaper.

Many reviewers have expressed dismay at how the discs are held.  This was not really a problem for me because another boxed set I recently purchased from Amazon (the newer Sex And The City Complete Series set, the white set that includes the movies) has its discs held in the same fashion.  I have a recommendation.  Use a Kleenex (to prevent smudging) to remove your discs the first few times you play them. Also, a use a couple of sprays of compressed air to loosen the paper/cardboard sleeves a bit.  This may sound like a bit of a hassle, but you have to consider why you are buying this set and who you are buying it for.  This is not a set for teenagers or children.  This is a set for collectors - adults or teenagers who actually know how to take care of things.  I just received the set today but I have pulled out every disc; there are some minor scratches on four discs but I have a disc repair kit and the scratches aren't deep - so I'm not worried.

I am thoroughly impressed with the amount of care the studio put into this set.  Few series get this treatment.  'Sex and the City' received this treatment twice; as previously noted I own the newer white boxed set with the same cardboard disc holders.  'Charmed' is another series that received this treatment, although that set did have problems with its discs (I was one of the lucky ones who did not).  I highly recommend this purchase.  Amazon sells it for $199.00.  I saw it in Target for $249.99.  You can't beat the Amazon price!",1329264000,4,2577,4.469957081545064

It was a wonderful journey. Watching Clark and company grow up was one of the best show experiences I have ever had. While this was a bit pricey, I was happy to pay it to have the entire series so I can leisurely go thru all the seasons over and over again.

4498272,2,B004XWLN20,"Smallville is a great series thats not why i give this product review 2 stars it due to the fact that whoever had the idea of packing 64 discs in a tight cardboard book wasn't really thinking. The idea was kinda of cool but that fact every disc gets scratched no matter what, unless you cut each disc out it is inevitable. If you are planning on buying this entire series just buy all the discs separately.

4498273,5,B004XWLN20,"Superman has had a tough history leaping off the page onto the big screen and onto the small screen. On top of that small screen adaptations of comic book characters, as well as attempts to create shows in comic book molds, haven't been very successful in recent years. Shows like Birds of Prey, Heroes, The Cape, Aquaman, No Ordinary Family, and Wonder Woman all suffered a grisly fate by the ax of the networks. The fact that Smallville lasted for ten seasons in an era of failing television comic book adaptations is quite surprising.

It's even more surprising considering most filmmakers working on the previous Superman movie wanted to shut down production on Smallville. This would have been the fate of Smallville if Tim Burton or McG had their way, and even JJ Abrams was working on a screenplay that rebooted the series and Tom Welling was one of the top choices to take the big screen role. In the end, though, Bryan Singer was cast and allowed the show to remain on the air.

This is one of those shows that I remember the first episode I watched. I originally wasn't going to watch the show. The WB, as it was at that time before changing to the CW, was full of preteen and teen melodrama. I didn't expect this to be any different, as a matter of fact I thought it was going to irreverent to the source, so I never tuned in. Then one day when nothing else was on I caught a season 3 episode called ""Velocity"". It was with that episode that my perception of Smallville changed.

While it has its moments of teen angst (""Velocity"" itself deals with teenage rebellion) and romance, it does try to remain faithful to the comics. It's even become revered by comic's artists who have added a few of the characters created for the show to the comic's lexicon, and a few writers have even shown up to pen episodes such as Geoff Johns. Even when hitting the moments of teen angst and romance the choice of using a young Clark coming to grips with who he is makes since.

What really caught me with Smallville, though, was the handling of the mythology; in this aspect the 2nd and 3rd seasons remain my favorites. The show delicately handled the growth and development of Clark's powers (in an interesting use of metaphor, ""Heat"" sees Clark developing his legendary heat vision at the sight of a beautiful woman). It was the handling of Clark and Lex Luthor's relationship that I found really interesting though.

They're relationship starts in the show when Lex drives his Porsche over the edge of a bridge narrowly missing Clark. Clark dives in after him, rips the car open, and saves Lex from drowning. What comes of that is an uneasy friendship. Lex suspects Clark of being more than a farm boy from Kansas and Clark constantly has to cover up his powers. Eventually this turns into a game of suspicions and betrayal before finally diving headlong into abject hatred.

All of this worked because the casting was impeccable. Tom Welling grew as an actor throughout the series, taking the helm to direct a few episodes. He also had that quality that embodies the qualities of the character we've grown to affectionately call ""the big blue boy scout."" Michael Rosenbaum oozes duplicity as Lex, making you question his every move and motive. In my opinion, even over Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey, Rosenbaum has portrayed the best version of Lex Luthor to hit the small or big screen.

Unfortunately, after the third season, the producers felt things had gotten too dark and felt the show needed to lighten up a bit. The result was that the fourth season became easily the weakest season in the series taking more cues from Charmed than the Superman canon. Luckily, they bounced back in the fifth season and the show remained strong for the rest of its run (although I'm sure I won't get any arguments when I say that the season 8 finale was quite anticlimactic).

5/5

This is a beautiful two-boxed set of 10 seasons (Seasons 1-5 in one box and 6-10 in the second box).  It includes extra footage such as gag reels, commentary and a show containing commentary from all the women that have played Lois Lane in the different Supermans, talking about being Lois.

In this case, it is family, upbringing, teenage angst, friendship, loyalty, all the things that make growing up exciting and difficult. Of course, there is all the Sci-Fi adventure, pieces of the legend to be that are foreshadowing for those who are new to the legend of Superman (yes, there is always a new generation out there), and just fun Ah, Ha! moments for those of us who have grown up with the story in its many incarnations over the decades. A word of warning, the packaging is great, visually. The DVDs are hard to remove and replace, and if there is ANY dust on the DVD when returned, it will scratch the surface since the packaging is a booklet format and the DVDs slide into very tight slots. Since my copy is used, like new, I am finding that there are scratches as I remove the disk to play it. So far only one DVD had a lateral scratch that caused a small skip, but I suggest great caution and the use of pressurized air to clean each ""page slot"" as you remove the disk and return it.

Do you want romance? Check. Do you want twisted romance (Lexana)? Check. Do you want Comic book action? Check. Do you want humor (Clois)? Check. Do you want A great charecter actor (John Glover)? Check. In short this show has it all.

You'll read in other reviews that the pilot is a must episode, the 100th episode, or the crashing meeting between Clark and Lois ("" Just look at his face""). I agree with them all but let me direct you to the first episode of the 3rd season ""Exile"". If you remember bad Superman in the 3rd movie this is the same idea but a lot more fun. And instead of Superman and Clark Kent faceing off. It's Father vs Son. Just a classic episode.

As for the box set you get two booklets with great pictures and the discs themselves Seasons 1-5 in one 6-10 in the other. The one problem is that the disc are in the booklets tight and do not come out as easy as they should. Scrathing is a concern.

It was filled with beautiful scenery, stories, relationships and people, all of which were grounded in a reality seldom seen in a sci-fi show. How lovely that the product issued to celebrate such a milestone would be as great. The packaging is sturdy, befitting a Superman saga, with gorgeous pictures throughout, as is the episode guide booklet. The Daily Planet newspaper is a nice touch as well as is the Aquaman pilot with Justin Hartley. I could have done without the Superboy extra and the DC Secret Origins, but that's just me. My favorite extras by far were the Comicon and Paley interviews and the season by season retrospectives.

4498290,3,B004XWLN20,"I'm a huge SV fan. Been one since about season two. And I wanted this awesome-looking collector's set so badly that I sold my seasons one through nine, some textbooks, etc. just to have money for it.

In the long run, I kind of regret doing that.

Here's the short version: If you already own seasons one through nine, do yourself a favor and just buy season ten. This big set, unfortunately, is not worth it.

Here's the long version: While the set looks beautiful, it's not practical. Each DVD is tightly (and I mean TIGHTLY) held in place by cardboard dividers. You literally have to pry out some of the DVDs from between two slats of cardboard. Obviously, this leaves some pretty heavy scratches. One of my DVDs looks like I set it on the floor, put my foot on top of it, and did the hokey pokey. The fronts of the DVDs look great, each season represented by a different Kryptonian symbol that die-hard fans will recognize. However, the DVDs are packed SO TIGHTLY that, sometimes, the symbols (and even the big shiny silver disc numbers) are rubbed off. This only happened to a couple of my discs, but it was sad to see.

Another thing I'm disappointed by: Despite the cool new look of these DVDs, they are the SAME DVDs from the previous sets. Same menu layout, same opening montage, everything. I thought we'd get something a little more fresh, but I was wrong.

The big books which hold the DVDs are neat, but their coolness only lasts as long as it takes for you to look at each panel. Same goes for the production notes and newspaper. They're really nice, but they don't make up for the horrible disc storage. I decided to store my Smallville DVDs in a DVD binder so that I never have to subject them to cardboard ever again.

And the special features... leave much to be desired. I was really looking forward to some insights and information that I had never heard before. What was it like making the show? What were some of the biggest challenges? What kinds of things did DC prevent the producers from doing? Audition tapes, script changes, etc.

At first, it seems the retrospective might go in that direction. But the more you watch it, the more you realize that this is really a look back on the different plot points in the show. The actors really say very little. Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson basically run down memory lane, discussing almost every plot element season by season, except (of course) the really bad ones (Super Lana, anyone?).

To summarize, it's nice to have these special features and the really cool box set, but the best features are actually packaged with the seasons themselves. In the long run, you're spending two hundred bucks for a set of cardboard boxes, a cheesy newspaper, and documentaries with about as much information as those CW web videos.

Sadly, Smallville: The Complete Series is not so super after all.",1322611200,402,2861,4.594117647058823

4498293,5,B004XWLN20,"The 10 seasons of Smallville can be broken down as follows:

Seasons 1 & 2  Clark discovers his powers and something of his origin and attempts to deal with it (remember, he is a high school frosh in the first season).

Seasons 2 (last and next to last ep), Season 3, Season 4, & Season 5 (through ep 3) Clark rebels against his destiny and Jor-el, still believing he can have some kind of normal life.

Seasons 5 (from ep 4 on), Season 6, Season 7 (ep 1) Clark resentfully and grudgingly accepts that he is not and will never be normal and gives up on normal relationships and starts to accept some parts of his supposed destiny that Jor-el and others are trying to force on him.

Season 7 (from ep 2 on), Season 8 (ep 1  Clark deals with being an adult who can no longer rely on his parents or surrogate parents and whose relationships are now adult relationships.

Season 8 (from ep 2 on), Season 9, Season 10 (through ep 11) Clark learns how to be a hero and creates his own destiny with aid from and despite Jor-el.

Season 10 (from ep 12 to the finale  Clark is effectively Superman and just has to finish up a few minor details like hiding his secret identity, his final supersuit, and flying.

Let's face it, of all the major superheroes Superman makes the least sense.  Bruce Wayne created Batman in order to terrorize criminals so they felt the fear he did when his parents were murdered.  He is motivated by revenge.  Wonder Woman was created by the Amazons in order to show their solidarity with the Allies against the Nazi threat to the world.  Peter Parker becomes Spiderman, first, to make money as a wrestler, but later as a superhero because of the guilt he feels because he might have been able to prevent the murder of his beloved Uncle Ben and realizes that with great power comes great responsibility.  Clark Kent?  What is his deal?  He becomes Superman because his parents were the salt of the Earth and so he of course becomes Superman.......wait, what?  That is pretty much the story of how Clark Kent becomes Superman in most of the stories in comics, movies, and tv.  There are some variations.  Sometimes he wears tights because they were made by his adoptive mom and sometimes his dad gave him the tights.  Until Smallville live action portrayals of Clark Kent becoming Superman have glossed over his transition.

Before Lois and Clark, the New Adventures of Superman, Clark Kent was the disguise and Superman the real person, which really doesn't make sense because if Clark decides to become Superman before he enters the larger world why not be John Smith?  Why create a Clark who can be traced back to Smallville and potentially lead enemies to his weakness and to his friends and family there?  Lois and Clark gave us a Clark that exists before Superman but it really doesn't give a good reason why dressing up in tights is a good idea and why he should waste his time fighting petty criminals instead of using his powers to end famine or global warming or the many other things he could do in order to save millions of lives.  The glossing over of this transition is most blatant in the historic Superman the Movie where teenage Clark (presumably having graduated from high school) leaves his elderly mother at the farm (after the neighbor has promised to give her a hand) and travels to the Arctic, creates the Fortress and then emerges 12 years later as Superman.  They give no explanation for anything that happened in that 12 year time period and again why does he head to the big city and establish himself as Clark Kent and not John Jones or Jack Sprat or anyone else?

Fortunately, we have Smallville.  Now Superman makes sense.  We know why he decides to become Superman.  We know why he is Clark Kent.  We know why he wears the tights and cape.  We know why he is with Lois Lane instead of spending every waking moment saving lives.  The ten year journey of teenage Clark Kent to the adult Boy Scout known as Superman makes it all come together.

I watched Smallville when it premiered and for the first three seasons.  After that I was too busy and I didn't have much time to watch tv so I missed the rest of Smallville and other shows (Buffy, Angel, Babylon 5, Farscape, etc.).  I did occasionally read comments about it, criticisms of some thing or another like the witches or Lexana but didn't pay much attention.  It was only after I had caught up on other shows I had missed (The Dead Zone, Crusade, etc.) that I remembered I had missed out on much of the last season of Lois and Clark from years ago which gave me some Superman nostalgia. I decided to watch those L&C episodes and then re-watch Superman the Movie and Superman II.  My nostalgia not sated and learning that Smallville was on its last season I thought, ""Hey, I should watch Smallville.  It was an ok tv show.""  I got the first dvd and watched and said to myself, ""I don't remember this show being this good.""  I then got the next disc and the next and hit the end of Season 2 and said to myself, ""Wow, this is really good.""

I learned a valuable lesson, the way to watch Smallville is without commercials.  Sure, that sounds like a lesson for all shows except that Smallville is different.  It has the feel of a theatrical release and not a tv show.  As I watched more episodes I would cringe as I approached episodes that had been roundly criticized by ""fans"" of the show and I found that that criticism was not merited.  The Lana possessed by a witch storyline was just fine.  It wasn't bad at all.  It was actually good.  Lana getting involved with Lex?  It made sense.  Clark not telling Lana his secret even though lots of bad guys found out.  Again, made sense.  Clark not flying?  What a stupid complaint, seriously of all the complaints during the 10 seasons this was the dumbest one.  All of this taught me another lesson.  The best way to watch Smallville is with few breaks between episodes.  If a person watched the series regularly they had to endure commercial breaks, cliffhangers that lasted weeks or months and storylines that ran through numerous episodes or even seasons before being resolved along with references to past continuity.  It is no wonder that some people would complain about the actions of a character or something in an episode if they couldn't remember something that happened previously.  By not having a great deal of time pass between episodes the viewer will find Smallville a much more satisfying experience.  Even the actions of Jor-el make a lot more sense within a compressed viewing time frame.  So, to sum up, for the best viewing of Smallville watch at least one episode each day (two or three if it is a season ending cliffhanger).

A final comment.  Smallville is its own world.  It does not have to reflect any past Superman continuity.  In fact, Superman in comics has no real continuity.  He has a number of different origins as do his foes.  A fan of Superman should not be offended that Lois Lane meets Clark Kent long before he is Superman and she is a reporter.  In the Smallville world it works out great.  It isn't as if Lex has hair and Pete Ross is the alien from Krypton.  Smallville has added a number of great things to the Superman mythos that ought to be adopted to the official Superman story and probably will because they make his story so much better.  It will be a long time before we will ever have another comic book legend adapted to tv that is this great (prove me wrong del Toro!).",1319328000,8,7472,4.507440476190476
4498294,5,B004XWLN20,"I actually never started to watch this show until it had just started it's fourth season. My best friend got me to watch it with her and I was addicted right away. I always loved the story of Superman and this show was so touching to watch how a young farm boy turned into, perhaps the most famous super hero ever. I have seasons 1-9 but have to confess I still plan on getting this yet for the special features. Now yes it is true the show had some up's and down's, prime example Lana as a vampire in an episode of season 5 but overall the show was amazing and the last 3 seasons were beyond phenomenal. The finale was everything a fan of this show would have wanted and then some. As hard as it was to see it end it went out covering everything that you would want to see. All time favorite episodes would have to include:
Season 1 : Pilot, Nicodemus, Crush
Season 2: Red,Rush, Rosetta, Exodus
Season 3: Exile, Shattered, Legacy
Season 4: Crusade, Transference, Spell (yes Spell), Pariah, Blank, Commencement
Season 5: Arrival, Mortal, Vessel
Season 6: Zod, Arrow, Crimson, Phantom
Season 7: Bizarro, Gemini, Arctic
Season 8: Odyssey, Bride, Eternal, Doomsday
Season 9: Savior, Kandor, Salvation

4498296,5,B004XWLN20,"I gotta say, while i have not purchashed this particular box set, i have been watching smallville for ages and own seasons 1-9 on dvd and looking forward to season 10 hitting australia, i think this is the best tv show ever, i have watched the series all the way through, then watched 7-9 again and now i'm watching it all the way through again. I love what they have done with the series, although a few things they could have done differently regarding the story line, but it's still and always will be my fav show. I love how they went from Clark as a teenager discovering his powers and eventually getting to superman, i'm sure if DC were not happy with it all they would not have approved it, so if they are happy with it i'm happy with it after all they are just telling stories that maybe weren't covered by the comics",1318636800,2,825,4.294871794871795
4498297,4,B004XWLN20,"...But if you look at it at the DVD set that it's intended to be, it sounds like it should be a really nice package. An episode guide will be included with production art and behind the scenes photo's, as well as the Daily Planet special looking at some of their biggest storylines over the years. And a 90-minute series retrospective is nothing to be sneezed at, ditto getting to see the 2010 Comic Con panel. The Superboy pilot doesn't interest me in the slighest I will admit, but apparently this set will include the Aquaman pilot starring Justin Hartley. I'm surprised that hasn't been used more as a selling point, instead of some failed pilot from the 60's LOL. By all accounts the pilot for Aquaman actually showed a lot of promise, and it will be interesting for Smallville fans to see Justin in that role so that extra I am really looking forward too. The packaging looks nice as well, so I think people are being a bit unfair and nitpickety to leave reviews acting like this whole release is just thrown-together carelessly unless it consists of blu-ray. It's pretty clear they've put a lot of thought into it

Of course I would rather this collection be available in blu-ray, but that hardly makes the DVD deserving of 1 star. I'm really looking forward to a complete series rewatch. In my opinion the best seasons are seasons 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. And the worst for me were probably seasons 4, 7 and 9. But hey nearly every season still has something to recommend it. I probably wouldn't have brought it for the original price, but for around $200 I'd say it's a pretty sweet deal when you consider that there's enough content here (10 years of Smallville!) to keep most fans busy for a very look time",1314921600,4,1711,4.501607717041801
4498298,2,B004XWLN20,"I have always loved the Superman stories so I watched this show, I didn't enjoy this show until the last 2-3 seasons. I stuck with it to see what would happen. I would have liked Tom Welling as Clark Kent if he had been better able to portray the good hearted person that the character was supposed to be. Maybe that was the intent of the creators of the show. Tom Welling's eyes were so cold in this show, vacant and very vain. I didn't believe that this Clark Kent was a very good person his eyes were completely vacant. To me, Clark Kent was supposed to be modest and even though he is Superman, he is not supposed to think he is a Super Man. I prefer Dean Cain as Superman, he actually fit the part. I am really not sure if the fault lays with the creators maybe they were trying to make him more human, or the actor. Otherwise I would have liked this show once it got past the first few seasons and once Lois came around. This show had enormous potential.",1313107200,2,960,4.166666666666667
4498299,5,B004XWLN20,"There are very few movies or TV shows I watch more than once but now that I am almost finished with the 218 episodes of Smallville, I do plan on watching them all again, maybe next summer, if I can wait that long.

As a kid and teenager, I used to buy all the Superman/Superboy/Supergirl/Batman, etc. comic books I could get my hands on, so I am pretty familiar with the story of Superboy and Superman. The comics are a bit different than what Smallville has come up with, but I love the way this was handled.

It is exciting and fun to watch Clark Kent discovering his powers one by one and becoming the highly moral, selfless hero that Superman is. I like that he has his parents and friends all there to support and help him when he isn't saving them. It is also quite funny to see all the inside jokes and references to other Superman TV shows or comics. I find it funny also that Clark Kent is afraid to fly even now that I am halfway into season 10.

I approve of the way Clark Kent dresses now that he is practicing as being a hero. I always cringed to see Superman wearing those tights and briefs with the cape. That red, blue and yellow costume looks ridiculous. Clark dresses in darker colors with the big S on his chest. So far I have not actually understood what the S is supposed to stand for. It is his family symbol from Krypton, but why an S?

I have found many things I can criticize over the 10 seasons, but not enough to make me stop watching this show. I don't like that the genres are always getting mixed together. In one episode, Lana Lang becomes a vampire. That was almost enough to make me say ""forget it!"" but luckily, that didn't last. I also think it is a bit strange that Clark is always being told how he is supposed to be the greatest savior this world has ever known. That seems to be putting him on an equal footing with spiritual masters and it doesn't make any sense because there are so many other people in this series with super powers including a bunch of Kryptonians at some point. For a guy who is supposedly almost invulnerable, he is constantly getting the (bleep) kicked out of him. I also didn't care for the season where Lana Lang moves in with Lex Luther and then marries him. It made me not like her although she wasn't evil, she was protecting Clark.

Tom Welling is about the perfect actor to play Clark Kent/Superman. He has the looks and the build. Besides being good looking, he can be the good boy, Clark and the bad boy, Dark Clark (when he is affected by Red Kryptonite). He does a convincing job either way.

The funny thing is that I never watched this show the whole time it was running, but as soon as it ended, I got hooked! I am glad I waited until it was on DVD because it is such a pleasure to watch all of the episodes without any commercials or TV icons on the screen as we see with TV shows all the time now. Also, it would have driven me nuts to have to wait from the season cliffhangers to the next season.",1312934400,22,2976,4.212280701754386

I believe I will purchase the hd digital versions of the first seasons and keep my bds. Why would I buy a complete set if the quality will be less than what I have? Yes, the additional features are tempting, but I can always rent them, and I am sure, at some point, someone will sell their extra features copy. I would go as far as buy the entire set even if only 5 seasons are bd and the rest are not... So, WB, you are wrong. Only people who do not already own bd seasons of the show will buy it. I always sell my single seasons whe a collection comes out, and it is justifyable because is better. More features and so on... Well not this time. I would give more stars, but without bd, I won't.

Most TV series now a days, barely make it through their first seasons and the lucky ones last 2 or 3 seasons tops. Back on October 16th 2001, no one was prepared for ""Smallville"". Sure, it was a series based on the Superman mythology but I doubt anyone expected it to be so re-freshing and unique. As soon as those meteors swept across the screen and took Smallville by storm, we knew we were in store for one hell of a series! Throughout it's 10 seasons, Smallville has had some truly incredible moments within some iconic, amazing episodes as well as some no so incredible moments will some of the most awful, embarrassing and plot stalling episodes. But despite all the ups and downs throughout the series' 10 year run, Smallville has become the longest running sci-fi/comic book superhero series in history, so it was obviously doing something right....right? Well, here is the Smallville: The Complete Series Boxset. All 218 episodes are here as well as an overwhelming supply of extras and bonus material including the famous Daily Planet ""Superman Saves the Day"" Newspaper which was featured in Smallville's 200th episode, ""Homecoming"".

4498308,5,B004XWLN20,"AUTHOR'S NOTE:  I will highlight and examine pivotal and/or great episodes from all ten seasons in this review.  Spoilers will follow.

REVIEW

""Smallville"" is a phenomenal series, never losing overall creative steam through ten years producing in excess of 200 episodes.  Starring Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, Annette O'Toole, John Schneider, John Glover and Allison Mack, it expertly tells the story of a youthful Clark Kent, growing up in the titular rural town.  It is arguably the most ambitious, well-executed TV series of its kind.

The first season picks up with a superlative pilot episode, as Clark's spaceship lands during a catastrophic meteor shower.  A red-haired boy named Lex Luthor gets his hair singed off by a meteor but escapes with his life.  The pilot also introduces a man by the name of Lionel Luthor.  Played superbly by John Glover, Lionel is a monstrously manipulative father for Lex.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Johnathan and Martha Kent find the baby whose ship was the reason for the meteor shower.  John Schneider and Annette O'Toole are a very youthful-looking Johnathan and Martha Kent, and play the parts so naturally it's easy to forget the image of older Eddie Jones and K Callan from ""Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman"" and Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter from ""Superman:  The Movie.""  Mr. Schneider and Ms. O'Toole pair with Tom Welling to form the best long-running representation of DC Comics' Kent Family I've ever seen.

The pilot, simply called ""Pilot,"" also puts forth that kryptonite invades Smallville with the meteors and creates genetically altered teenagers.  Admittedly, the first of the bunch, a guy named Jeremy Creek, isn't necessarily the strongest villain.  But, his story presentation sets up iconic imagery for the series.  As Smallville High's first Scarecrow, Jeremy is a harbinger for the brand of torture that eventually befalls Clark himself.  An equally important story theme is the premise that the meteors that Clark rides in with kill Lana Lang's natural parents.  This gives Clark and Lana an intriguing set of issues that keep them apart.  Lana also ignorantly wears a kryptonite necklace as a keepsake that keeps Clark at a distance.

First season episode highlights are ""Pilot,"" ""Hourglass,"" ""X-Ray,"" ""Leech,"" ""Jitters,"" ""Zero,"" and ""Stray.""  Guest stars in the first season include Amy Adams, Eric Christian Olsen, and Shawn Ashmore.

The second season of ""Smallville"" is also very solid.  Beginning with ""Vortex,"" it presents a new set of challenges for both Clark and Lex and deepens the overall storyline considerably.  Lex becomes more obsessed with Clark and more distrustful and hostile toward his hateful father.  This season sows seeds that the series expands upon for years.  In ""Skinwalker,"" Clark discovers a cave system that connects brilliantly to his own life story, and he also develops an infatuation with a beautiful Native American activist.  Here is one of the series' first sustained myth-building devices, as the Kawatche Caves are revisited substantially over the next two years.  The series also takes a leap toward its future with ""Rosetta,"" a very well-conceived way for Clark to first learn about Krypton.  Widely-respected ""Superman"" film actor Christopher Reeve makes the first of two appearances as Dr. Virgil Swann, a reclusive billionaire scientist interested in Clark's life and powers.

Second season episode highlights are ""Vortex,"" ""Skinwalker,"" ""Rosetta,"" ""Calling,"" ""Ryan,""  ""Suspect,"" and ""Insurgence"".  Notable guest stars for the second season are Christopher Reeve, Terence Stamp, Paul Wesley(billed as 'Paul Wasilewski'), Emmanuelle Vaugier, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

The third season is very, very strong as the series matures into a meaty yarn with epic ambitions.  An expansion of a pronounced father-son theme evident from the pilot means deeper storylines for John Schneider as well as John Glover.  The extreme differences between the show's fathers come to the forefront in the third season premiere.  John Schneider's Johnathan Kent is in anguish and desperate for Clark's safe return in ""Exile,"" whereas John Glover's Lionel Luthor is nonchalant about Lex's own disappearance.  ""Exile"" also features Rutger Hauer as Morgan Edge, a top crime boss in Metropolis who slyly takes advantage of Clark's red kryptonite-affected superpowers for his own gain.  The follow-up show ""Phoenix"" is a perfect continuation of the premiere, as Edge and members of his gang trail a safely restored Clark back to Smallville.

The third season is so strong that I could legitimately list eighteen or nineteen of it's twenty-two episodes as highlights.  Nevertheless, episode highlights are ""Exile,"" ""Legacy,"" ""Perry,"" ""Relic,"" ""Shattered,"" ""Memoria,"" and ""Covenant.""  Notable guest stars are Rutger Hauer, Patrick Bergin, and Michael McKean.

The fourth season introduces Lois Lane, at first a recurring character on the show played by Erica Durance.  The season touches briefly on the Lane Family by bringing in guest star Michael Ironside for two episodes as Gen. Sam Lane, Lois' father.  Also, Peyton List appears for one episode as Lois' sister Lucy Lane.  Unfortunately, the season soon turns primarily to Lana Lang and her new boyfriend for the season, Jason Teague.  Played by Jensen Ackles of TV's ""Supernatural,"" Jason Teague is a thin character who is upstaged by his mother Genevieve.  Genevieve Teague is deliciously played by Jane Seymour.  The Teagues connect to an ill-conceived witch plotline for Lana Lang that bogs down most of the season.

Episode highlights for the fourth season are ""Crusade,"" ""Unsafe,"" ""Pariah,"" ""Run,"" and ""Commencement.""  Notable guest stars are Michael Ironside, Jane Seymour, and Margot Kidder.

The fifth season is terrific, continuing to embellish toward the ""Superman"" legend, with arguably the series' boldest character push in that direction to that point.  The season introduces Brainiac in the form of a humanoid college professor played by James Marsters.  Mr. Marsters does a very nice job of playing the character, and he and Tom Welling have a very good season-long story arc together.  Brainiac plays off of Clark and Lex in different ways, and the character becomes both a menace on his own terms and a harbinger of Zod.

Fifth season episode highlights are ""Arrival,"" ""Mortal,"" ""Solitude,"" ""Splinter,"" ""Cyborg,"" ""Lexmas,"" and ""Oracle"".  Notable guest stars are Carrie Fisher, James Marsters, Alan Ritchson, and Lee Thompson Young.

The sixth season continues to bring other ""Superman"" locales and themes into play.  The season premiere ""Zod"" debuts an awesomely executed, fully believable Phantom Zone and an intriguing new female character named Raya.  The premiere also introduces Jimmy Olsen for the first time in the series, played to great effect by Aaron Ashmore.  Oliver Queen is introduced in the season's second episode ""Sneeze,"" and debuts his full Green Arrow persona two shows later in the aptly titled ""Arrow.""  Oliver is played by Justin Hartley, and has a prep school history with Lex, explored in the episode ""Reunion.""  Clark is busy battling Phantom Zone escapees, and heartbreakingly watching a very frustrated Lana agree to marry an increasingly nasty Lex Luthor.

Sixth season episode highlights are ""Zod,"" ""Arrow,"" ""Nemesis,"" ""Promise,"" and ""Justice.""  Notable guest stars are Justin Hartley and Phil Morris.

The seventh season introduces the series' version of Kara Zor-El/Supergirl, played by Laura Vandervoort.  It's an up-and-down season that is strongest when it focuses almost exclusively on Clark, as in the excellent ""Traveler.""  Big changes come to the cast in general this year.  Notable guest stars are Marc McClure and Helen Slater.

Episode highlights are ""Bizarro,"" ""Traveler,"" and ""Persona.""

The eighth season brings on both Davis Bloome and Tess Mercer, played respectively by Sam Witwer and Cassidy Freeman.  The season also finally makes Justin Hartley a regular.  Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan takes a dark turn in an unhealthy relationship with Davis.  Clark must contend with the morally slippery Tess Mercer, and the progressively dangerous Davis Bloome.  Episode highlights are ""Odyssey,"" ""Bride,"" ""Legion,"" and ""Beast.""

The ninth season brings Zod on in corporeal form, played very solidly by Callum Blue.  The season does a good job of giving Zod weight, by giving him a true army and a good backstory.  Episode highlights are ""Savior,"" ""Metallo,"" and ""Kandor.""  Guest stars are Brian Austin Green and Julian Sands.

The tenth season ends the series wonderfully, bringing back veteran ""Smallville"" actors in meaningful roles and giving Clark his biggest challenges ever in Darkseid and his minions.  Guest stars are John Schneider, John Glover, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O'Toole, James Marsters, Christine Willes, and Lucas Grabeel, among many others.  Episode highlights are ""Kent,"" ""Luthor,"" ""Abandoned,"" ""Dominion,"" and ""Finale.""

I probably will not buy this set, as it will mostly be repeating what I already own or plan to own with individual season sets.  ""Smallville"" is a truly great television series, though.",1306713600,3,9173,5.390998593530239
4498309,5,B004XWLN20,"I started watching Smallville after season 9 was started but I'm the type of person who has to watch things from the beginning, so thats what I did. I went and watched the first 9 season online, then I bought half of them on DVD and now I wish I hadn't. I wish I had know that season 10 would be the last when I bought all the DVDs because I would of waited and got this set it looks amazing. So if you havn't already got the DVDs get this and I will be jealous. [plus the aquaman pilot always wanted to see that]",1306627200,,513,3.895238095238095
4498310,5,B004XWLN20,"On October 16 2001, the WB Network aired the pilot episode for a new series that would portray a young boy in a small Kansas town who not only dealt with the pressures and insecurities of high school, but also struggle of honing and mastering emerging superpowers.  This boys name is Clark Kent in a town called Smallville.  Al Gough and Miles Miller, executive producers and show creators, set out to make a new television series that would re-tell the origins of Earth's Greatest Hero, but before his tights and flights.  By focusing on the story of Clark Kent, and not his future alter-ego, Superman, ""Smallville"" grounded the characters and the mythology in a very real world.  Clark Kent (Tom Welling) is portrayed as the average high school freshman, when the series starts out.  He has no knowledge of his alien-origins, nor does he have any idea of what his future holds.  He has insecurities and doubts and feels like an outsider.  He secretly admires the prettiest girl in school, Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), has a best friend in Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack), but can only entrust his special abilities to his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schnieder & Annette O'Toole).  Through sheer chance (or destiny) and a 60 mph crash with a Porsche, Clark Kent meets and befriends his future nemesis, Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum).

While the first season of the show is focused primarily on creating the basis of Clark Kent's life, the majority of his conflicts in the first season are with ""Meteor Freaks"", people who have been physically affected by the green meteor rocks that rained down on Smallville in the 1989 meteor shower.  Little did anyone know that these green rocks were actually Kryptonite, radioactive pieces of the dead planet Krypton.  The first season may start off a bit slow, but it is very clear that the show runners wanted to set Clark Kent and all the supporting characters in a more reality-based series by making it more of a high school drama.  It is not until season 2, when Clark meets famous astrologist Virgil Swann (special Superman guest star Christopher Reeve) that Clark actually learns of his true origins: That he is Kal-El, the last son of Krypton.  That he was sent to Earth by his biological father, Jor-El, to save his life.  This, in my opinion, is where the show really takes off and really starts to dive into Kryptonian-based storylines and really starts to work off the years of mythology in the comic books.

As the series progresses, Clark is faced with several trials and choices.  Some are presented to him through the voice and memory of Jor-El and some are forced upon him by the enemies he fights.  Through it all, Clark has doubts and often fights the future he is destined to have.  This made the show all the more appealing to me, as it grounded the character in a certain reality.  So often, in the movies and comics, Superman/Clark Kent is portrayed as the blue boy scout who always does the right thing because he knows it's the right thing to do.  However, in ""Smallville"" we see that Clark learns how to make the right decisions through the guidance of his earth parents, but more importantly, through the mistakes that he makes.  Clark so badly wants to have a life of his own and to be happy that he tries to be more normal than anyone else.  When he fights his destiny, it often leads to the hurting and sometimes deaths of the people he cares about most.

It is in season 5 and on where the series hits its true stride.  With the formation of the Fortress of Solitude, ""Smallville"" brings in even more Superman and DC Comics lore.  From season 5 to season 10, we see Clark fight famous villains such as Zod, Brainiac, Bizarro, Metallo, Doomsday, Parasite, and countless others.  In season 4, Clark meets Bart Allen, a member of The Flash Family.  In season 5, he meets Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Victor Stone/Cyborg.  In season 6, we get a series regular in Oliver Queen/Green Arrow (Justin Hartely).  In season 6, we're given our first look at what will become the future Justice League of America.

Perhaps one of the most appealing parts of the show in the last 3 years was the contribution of fan favorite comic scribe, DC Comics legend Geoff Johns.  In season 8, he introduced Clark to the Legion of Superheroes from the 31'st century in ""Legion"".  In season 9, Clark and his super friends teamed up with the first superhero team to ever appear in comics, the Justice Society of America, namely the characters Hawkman, Doctor Fate, and Stargirl in ""Absolute Justice"".  ""Absolute Justice"" was also the first 2-hour movie event for the series.  Johns' last episode was in season 10, where Clark met the glory grabbing showboat from the 25th Century, Booster Gold and witnessed the birth of a new hero in the form of Blue Beetle in ""Booster"".

Action packed with spectacular special effects, compelling storylines, amazing guest stars from Superman-incarnations past, ""Smallville"" became the longest running U.S. produced Sci-Fi television series.  As a fan of the show for all 10 years, I can honestly say that it gets better as each season progresses.  It's one of the few shows based on superheroes/comic book characters that actually does justice to the comics that they're based on.  I have watched a lot of tv shows in my time, and I can honestly say that ""Smallville"" is at the top of my list.  While you may find yourself constantly wondering if you'll see him fly or don the iconic red and blue suit, you will be even more satisfied when you realize just how involved you are in the life of Clark Kent.  What this series did that no other tv series or movie did for Superman is that it captured the true persona of the character.  It's not Superman.  It's not Kal-El of Krypton.  It's not the bumbling Clark Kent we see at the Daily Planet.  It's the Clark Kent that was raised on a farm in a town called Smallville.

For anyone who is looking for a serious, modern take on the world's greatest superhero and to truly discover how a young man could become a Superman, ""Smallville"" is the answer you're looking for.  It's 10 years of compelling storylines that will leave you asking for more with characters so great and interesting that you'll find yourself in a comic shop looking for more.  Never have I seen a television series incorporate SO much of the DC Comics mythology and cast of characters.  Everyone from Clark Kent, Lex Luthor, the Kents, to the Flash, Aquaman, Hawkman, Booster Gold, Doctor Fate, Metallo, Zod, Bizarro, Brainiac, Doomsday, and even Darkseid and his minions from Apocalypse.  It's a show you won't want to miss out on and you'll never regret seeing.",1306281600,6,6705,4.70926243567753

Warner brothers did a great job with Superman the ultimate collection when it came out and so i can't wait for this to be in my home. I have been collecting the individual seasons but will gladly give them up to have the complete collection. So come on AMAZON GIVE US A RELEASE DATE so i can start counting the days until this arrives in my mailbox or on my door step. I am ready to never forget Smallville.,1306108800,,807,4.081761006289308
4498312,2,B004XWLN20,"As this is a review of the show, and not a DVD vs Blu-Ray rant, be warned that spoilers will be present.

The feel and format of Smallville transformed over the years.
The first seasons' plots focused on Clark learning how to deal with his developing powers, learning about his origins, and dealing with the ""freak of the week"" (title unofficially given the latest ""meteor rock"" infected local) and the other effects caused by the massive amounts of kryptonite in the area.

The show then switches focus to prophesy. There are Native American prophesies about the coming of Superman, occult proficies about him, secret societies looking for his arrival and the means to control him, etc.

The last few seasons did away with the ""freak of week"" and the prophesies in exchange for story arcs based on actual comic book villians such as Doomsday, Zod, and Darkseid.

The series also started out with a lighter feel in the beginning and slowly got darker and darker as the series progressed.

What worked:
- Clark learning to cope with and control each new power as it developed
- The relationship between Clark and Lex. It many ways, it was more interesting to see Lex's decent from friend and ally to villian.
- Introduction/guest shots of variouos other super heroes and villians.
- The moral grounding that Jonathon Kent gave to the program. (Both Clark's character and the show suffered from the loss of Jonathon Kent).
- The help Clark received from the small circle of friends who knew about his powers. (I am mostly referring to Pete and Chloe in the earlier seasons. Then it worked as friends who had his back. As that circle got larger and larger, it felt as if there were less and less meaning behind it.)

What did NOT work:
- Lana. She was fine in the beginning as the girl young Clark has a crush on, but it was drawn out far too long. Her character became a cruch for the writers who kept going back to the ""will they/won't they"" scenerio, even as late into the program as season 8, after Clark had already started a relationship with Lois. She should have been regulated to ""just friends"" status back around season 4. Season 5's ""Reckoning"" was a perfect time to cement the fact that Lana was not ""the One"". After Clark proposed, the writer's should have had her unable to be able to deal with the fact that he is an alien. Instead, they went with the tired ""let's change things with time travel"" nonsense.
- Clark does not fly. This was fine when he was still in highschool, but it became rediculous when Supergirl was added, and could fly. When Zod could fly within moments of getting his powers. And when other Kryptonians are flying within seconds of getting their powers. Ten years of Clark not being able to figure it out is far too long. (I know that the creaters had a ""no tights/no flights"" policy, but the the show outgrew at least the flights part of that policy by the 6th season.)
- Replacing Lex with Tess.
- Clark is too wishy washy throughout the series with the inability to make decisions.
- The show became far too dark, both in feel and film. Superman is supposed to be bright and uplifting stories about good triumphing over evil. By the end, ""good"" feels like its been wallowing about in the muck right beside evil as the character interaction between the good guys devolved into a ""who is sleeping with who"" senerio.
- The final payoff, the ""birth"" of Superman, felt weak as well. Almost nothing was seen of Superman and he did not dispell the darkness by the ""light"" of his example, but by simply pushing the planet away. There were other loose strings that it seemed that the writers noticed at the last minute and just rushed to tie up, like Lex needing to be Clark's greatest enemy.

In conclusion, this is a series that had a tremendous amount of potential, but much of that potential is squandered.",1306108800,9,3839,4.579330422125182
4498313,1,B004XWLN20,"Smallville killed Superman, the creators obviously hated the character and that's why they stay away from him for so many years. And when they finally bring in Superman, he is animated poorly, has just three close up shots, and the scenes with him are incredibly poor renditions of classic Superman events. This is due to the fact that the creators clearly read maybe ten issues of the Superman and hated them so they decided to reboot him as winey teenager who becomes a winey adult and only one time is referred to as Superman. Most of the time he's given a really stupid name called the Blur or he saves people as just Clark. Problem with that is Clark never wears glasses and isn't nerdy to hide his identity. So when Superman arrives everyone knows its Clark.
For about half of the series the show is teen drama with small amounts of Superman events, but most of it is just kids wining about their lives and messing up their chances to hook up with each other. The other half of the show delivers a bit more Superman events but ends up giving all the action to Green Arrow. And that doesn't make any sense, everything Green Arrow does is what Clark should have done as Superman. But because Clark doesn't become Superman until the last ten minutes of the last episode, Green Arrow does all the action Clark should have been doing.
Or during the season Supergirl shows up, she does all the action Clark should do, but since he's not Superman, Clark doesn't get to do the action.
The creators also took it upon themselves to ruin Doomsday. They basically turn his character into a poor version of the Hulk. Doomsday spends most of the time as human who turns into a monster when he gets angry or jealous. And then he kills Jimmy Olson, what kind of Superman world would it be without Jimmy Olson? A stupid one created by people who hated the world of Superman and decided to change it poorly.
There is one good episode of the series and that is when the Justice League raid a plant owned by Lex. But that doesn't occur until about halfway through the series. Reason why that episode is good is because they characters finally perform Superman actions and are given a story which is ripped from the comics. And that is interesting story telling, but there are barely any episodes like that in this show. Small amounts of action occur in the last fifteen minutes of a episode and the rest of it is just talking about feelings and have the characters feeling sorry for themselves. Boring, and not Superman at all.
Now for those that want to watch good films of Superman and other comic book heroes, check out the animated films from DC Films Animated Studios. The films are done by fans of the comics and they stay true to the characters. Films are released about every six months, they're just under an hour and a half, and end up getting PG-13 ratings because of all the action. You get more action in 80 minutes than in an entire season of Smallville.",1306022400,13,2954,4.5027932960893855
4498314,5,B004XWLN20,"The finale really sucked, and really deflated what was an outstanding season 10. The cheesy CGI graphics of Kent saving Air Force One was the biggest LOL moment of the series, and it wasn't meant to be funny.
I enjoyed every season on Smallville except for season 7, but the show quickly bounced back for some of it's best episodes ever in season 8.
I plan on purchasing this set, as I am huge fan of the genre.
The episodes featuring Christopher Reeve are forever special, as they showed the strength of that man and his fight for life.

4498315,4,B004XWLN20,"First let me say, this is an awesome show and I love the shows version of Lex Luthor. I have been watching since it began, when I was 17 years old. and here I am at age 27, just watched the finale on Friday, It wasn't the greatest it could have been but I am still happy with it :) still sad to see it go. You become attached, I know its weird because it is a show but it is like a pet, its always sad losing something you've became attached to. Despite some of the shows misses, it had a lot of great hits and brought some iconic characters to life in live action for the first and maybe only time any of these comic characters will. Characters like: Booster Gold, Hawk Man, Aquaman and more. Anyway the collection looks amazing but sadly they were unable to bring the set to Blu Ray, they tried but it was going to be to expensive to redo the special effects in the earlier of the season. It burns a lot since I already own season 7-9 on Blu Ray and want the rest, waiting for the release but now it won't happen. With that said I may sell my Blu Ray's in Mint and take advantage of the deal with iTunes.

4498321,5,B004XWLN20,"I already own the first 9 seasons so I most likely will not be purchasing this set, though I admit the special features tempt me! This review is for anybody who is not a Smallville fan, or perhaps was one at one point but lost interest. This is my promotion for you to purchase this set and experience a journey that is truly epic. Smallville premiered when I was a freshman in High School, the same time Clark Kent was a freshman, though who really bought Tom Welling as a 14 year old? I remember being anxious for the premiere due to the fact I had always been a die-hard superman fan. The pilot did not disappoint, it gave just the right amount of intrigue and nostalgia as it set up the tale of a young Clark Kent as he begins his destiny towards becoming the greatest super hero the world has ever known. It was the perfect mix of action and teen angst as we watch Clark deal with everyday teenage problems when Clark is anything but the average teenager. The casting was perfect as Tom Welling looked every bit what anyone would envision the future man of steel to be. What teenage girl wouldn't fall for that dark hair and baby blue (errr...green) eyes? I began to watch the show fairly regularly, back before DVR; I recorded the episodes on VHS tapes for later viewing. I'll admit the first couple of seasons got a little repetitive with the whole ""freak of the week"" line up but it was always worth it for those juicy morsels of superman mythos. I didn't over analyze the show or get mad when they went off comic book script, I took it for what it was which was just entertaining. Smallville just became my thing; my 45 min escape from all things real world and everything fantasy. As I went into my college years I stopped recording the show regularly and for the most part lost track of all things Clark Kent. Then one random day I received a care package from my Mom that contained the first 4 seasons on DVD. I immediately went down memory lane as I began to re-watch the show I stopped watching years earlier. It was great to catch up again and after finishing the first four I immediately wanted season 5 and 6. So I hit the local best-buy and added to my collection. The show was only getting better for the most part and I was starting to see more and more signs of Superman. Then after I finished season 6 I again lost track of Smallville, I honestly didn't think the show was even still on. Then last year I was breezing through Amazon.com and saw a promotion fro season 9. Season 9!!! Wow the show has lasted 9 years. Right then and there I bought Season 7-9 and pretty much devoured them in a couple months. I then even went back to watch from the beginning right before the 10th season started on the CW. I can't really explain what it is about Smallville, I just love it! I admit not every episode has been stellar; and there were definitely times I had some cringe-worthy moments watching the show. However, the same theme has been true throughout and never faltered, it's the story of a man destined to do extraordinary things. This season of Smallville has made it to my every week DVR list and I love being able to watch once a week or catch up on a couple over the weekend. I even go back from time to time and grab one of my DVD sets and throw on an episode I'm in the mood for. I'm sure I've seen every episode at least twice and some even more. Now on May 13, 2011 Clark Kent's journey is coming to an end. It's bittersweet for me, as much as I would love for it to continue it's time for Clark to become Superman. I honestly feel the show over the past couple of seasons has been the best it's ever been and it's good to go out with a bang! The good thing about Smallville is that you know it never really ends; in fact the ending is the beginning which is inspiring. Though perhaps I have been a bit of a wish-washy fan over the years I have been a fan none of the less, so this Friday I will not be at my usual bar, I will be on my couch at 8:00 as I watch Clark Kent for the last (and hopefully the first) time take flight. Thank you so much to the Creators, Cast and Crew for all your dedication and hard work over the years and for fighting so hard to keep the show alive so it can end with the beginning it deserves. I hope that many of you will purchase this set so you yourself can be inspired to fly.

Season 1: Pilot, Stray, Tempest
Season 2: Red, Rush, Fever, Rosetta

I will certainly have this complete set when it releases. It is a perfect set! The original copy of The Daily Planet newspaper is awesome!

4498331,5,B004XWLN20,"It is with great sadness and fondness that I see the end of Smallville, the best show there has ever been. It has been an incredible journey spanning 10 wonderful years, and I am honored to have been a part of it all. I'm proud to have seen every single episode and to have shared in the iconic moments big and small. But, as they say, all good things must come to an end.

Sadly, those of you who are waiting and hoping for a Blu-ray release will more than likely be disappointed. It does not appear they have plans to release the series in that format. Some people (like myself) feel that the Blu-ray format will eventually go the way of HD DVD's. Some people feel Blu-ray technology is here to stay. Regardless of your opinion, I don't think DC will go through the trouble (or expense) to convert Seasons 1-4, which were only released in standard def, or Season 5, which was presented in HD-DVD format during it's short time on this earth.

I think this standard disc set will be fabulous no matter what. Aside from good transfer quality, I feel that features are what matter most, and this is filled with hours upon hours of exclusive features. And to those of you who have never watched the standard DVD's, let me tell you -they look amazing! I did have a PS3 at one time, so I've seen them in Blu-ray as well as standard, and with an upconverting standard DVD player, the quality isn't too terribly different.

All that being said, however, I do wish the box was a little more creative (in the shape of the Fortress of Solitude would have been nice, or maybe even Kal El's ship). I am willing to put that aside to enjoy all the great features that we are being given. This collection will live happily on my DVD shelf between Smallville, Season 10 and The Adventures of Superman - Season 1.

Any person who considers themselves a serious fan of Smallville should add this set to their collection, no matter what format it's in. I'm pre-ordering mine now, while the price is still so low (I imagine it will go up closer to release).",1304035200,2,2037,4.409574468085107

4498334,5,B004XWLN20,"Given that HD versions of Seasons 1-4 episodes already exist for purchase or rental on Amazon Video on Demand (as well as Netflix, etc.), Warner's claim that the special effects during these seasons were produced in standard definition only and not up to Blu-ray full capabilities, doesn't really hold water.  The HD versions have already been produced and exist to master the Blu-rays from limiting Warner's additional production costs.

My system includes the latest Panasonic 65"" 3D plasma display (Pioneer SC-37 7.1 AV Receiver; JBL L-880's) and video collection features Blu-ray & HD-DVD copies of seasons 5-9 (10's on order).  I have also viewed seasons 1 through 4 on DVD (along with several HD episodes using VOD) and once beyond about the start of season two, the video reproduction is actually quite good.  Not Blu-ray resolution and color depth, but better than I have seen in many other DVD's of TV programs I own.  In regards to the visual special effects, even on the latest season Blu-rays, Smallville's TV sized production budget shows in most shots.  In fact, some of the effects shots being used in the later seasons date back to the very earliest episodes (i.e. night shot of the Daily Planet building with the helicopter flying down and then existing screen left) so I am not sure why Warner is concerned we would be disappointed in the Blu-ray results now.

The Blu-rays would also offer the benefits of lossless audio which with some of the very impressive sound tracks this series has produced would really be missed on the DVD's.  If Warner were to invest the extra money now to make this package available in Blu-ray in today's dollars, I suspect the potential exists for this series to be a very long term profit center with little future costs.  I understand that there will be a difference in the quality as the seasons progress if they were to produce seasons 1-4 in HD to go along with their existing HD masters available for seasons 5-10 but considering how poor other series (i.e. Six Million Dollar Man) vary in quality not only from season to season on DVD, but from episode to episode as well in the same year, I'm not sure Warner can use the excuse of low resolution visual effects as an excuse in this case.

Please include on the packaging (external & internal) noting the fact as many prior disc issues have already done and I suspect the vast majority of the buyers will understand the limitation you had to work from.  The reduced number of Blu-ray discs and their smaller number of masters needed (instead of 62 DVD's) for a complete collection should also help to offset the higher Blu-ray production costs.

Warner, there's still time and from the studio that has produced some really memorial Blu-rays (i.e. Blade Runner) for my collection, I hope that you will produce what your customers are wanting to buy.  The price is certainly high enough to justify the effort and in the end, isn't that how a business model succeeds.

QUICK FIRST VIEWING IMPRESSION UPDATE:  November 29, 2011

Perhaps this might help should you be considering acquiring the Blu-ray release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Tenth-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B003L77GGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray</a>] in addition to or in lieu of purchasing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>.  Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode ""Finale"" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.

Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;ultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode ""Homecoming""), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.

If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Tenth-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B003L77GGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray</a>] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the SD seasons included in the complete series were double dipped as the extras on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;appear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.",1303948800,66,6566,5.579476861167002

4498336,5,B004XWLN20,"NOTE- This is NOT a review of the box set. It is a review of the series in general.

Smallville has managed to last 10 years. One whole decade. I have never really been a fan of the Superman movies. I personally prefer Spiderman over Superman. But Smallville is a whole new story. I decided to give Smallville a try last year (2010). I watched seasons 1-9 online in about 4 months. I couldn't take my eyes off it! I fell in love with the storylines. I am very glad I got into the show in time to enjoy the final season with all the Smallville fans while it airs.

I personally don't know how I feel about purchasing huge box sets such as this one due to warranty reasons. I purchased LOST The Complete Collection the day it was released and for the first 20 days I was able to replace the damaged disks for free. Now I am stuck with some damage disks and the only way for me to replace them is to buy a whole new seperate SEASON that the disk is from.
