Although not enough killing in this one i was hoping there would've been more carnage. The two main girls are hott i couldn't take my eyes off them. I've watched lots of clown movies that i thought were just stupid but this one on the other hand was one of the better low budget horror ones about a clown, im not one of those people who are terrified of them so i don't mind watching and collecting horror films of clowns. I was just hoping for a longer story and a bit more killing from chuckles. wasn't disappointed at all and it did live up to the storyline behind it.",1504828800,,698,4.2556390977443606
8549997,4,B003D7L7TK,"Chuckle's Revenge is a very interesting example of an independent film!  It is shorter in length that most of similar genre (about the length of a regular TV show), but that can be extended by the choices one makes via the ""interactive features"".  I would say there are about eight choices one must make in either a ""left/right"" or ""yes/no"" type choice using the DVD remote controls left/right arrow/menu functions.  This does make the film fun.  I would say the script exhibits the dialog and cast of characters expected in a ""B"" film of this type.  I would recommend this film to those who are fans of the genre, especially those who like the ""B"" films from the 1980's!  Although there are a few startling scenes, I would not consider them ""terrifying"".  I would not recommend this one for kids though!

  I would like to those who wrote and produced this film, use the same or similar concept in a film of typical length!  If they make it, I will buy it!",1408838400,,957,4.505813953488372
8549998,4,B003D7L7TK,"Chuckles Revenge.  What starts as a joke quickly turns into horror.  One year later, Chuckle seeks revenge, setting his sadistic sights on those who hurt him.

For all you Horror Film-lovers out there, here's an interactive Horror film.  That's right!  Chuckle's Revenge lets the viewer choose the fate of the characters'.  This is a real movie.  Completely cut edited and released on DVD.  This DVD is great for adult parties and adult sleepovers.  Everyone can vote on what the characters' should do next in a scene.  Two options are available and which ever way is chosen, the story adjusts and sometimes the characters' path is altered.

While watching a horror film, ever find yourself yelling at the TV screen ""for the helpless girl to not go down that dark alley""?  Ever find yourself clenching your seat with your buttocks, because you know one of the characters' unknowingly walked into the room where the killer was hiding?  With Chuckle's Revenge, you won't have to.  Just use your remote!",1381363200,,1000,4.910179640718563

I'm looking forward to seeing future work from her.  Give it a shot if you're a fanatic of clownsploitation.",1381190400,,246,4.833333333333333

BUT BE CAREFUL you never know what DANGER could be lurking around the corner!!! ""ITS SO MUCH FUN, ITS SCARY!"" plus... ""Kristen"" (Nicola Fiore) is a sexy addition to any movie!
