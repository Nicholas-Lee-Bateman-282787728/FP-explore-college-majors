Since cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, NOVA created reenactments from the trial transcript. These are interspersed with interviews of the people involved, including the experts and lawyers and parents and politicians.

There is also coverage of the national media coverage of the story, lending a sort of hall-of-mirrors effect to the program. A brief review of Darwin's theory, including clips from NOVA's own special on the topic called ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea,"" and a descendant of Charles Darwin who is a movie script writer and suggests that this may be evidence refuting the theory of evolution all by itself. He's joking, but you do have to ask the question whether the entire controversy could function as proof that we have not evolved as far from apes as we may have thought.

Content substance 1.5 out of 5.

This is quite interesting attempt to lie on the subject.
Agenda as follows:
1.) Portray reenacted characters in a way where Darwinists are humble, meek and honest truth seekers and IDers as arrogant and/or ignorant. Here's a hint: turn of volume and observe body language, moves, behaviors, and guess who is Darwinist and who is ID proponent. :D Unbelievable manipulation!
2.) At ALL COSTS DO NOT LET proponents of ID to speak their mind. Interview ONLY Darwinists! In this video you will hear a lot of monologues from Miller, and Eugene Scott [who else? after all those are key trolls]k, but where are the other side? Oh I know, they are not allowed to speak, and even if they were, their speeches would be edited to extent that they would say anything you want...
3.) After #1 and #2 was successfully executed, add distorted or irrelevant information. Here's the best of all excerpt on the subject:
@1:40 [first minute 40th second] Scott says, ""the fundamental problem with Intelligent Design is that you cannot use it to explain natural world. It's essentially a negative argument. It says evolution doesn't work, therefore the designer did it. Evolution doesn't work, therefore we win by default. But when you ask them, what does intelligent Design tell you about nature ? Does it tell you what the designer did? Does it tell you what the designer used to design something with? Does it tell you what purpose the designer had for designing something? Does it tell you when the designer did it? Why the designer did it? it doesn't tell you anything like that. Basically it is negative argument. You can't built science on a negative argument.""
- Oh, I see...this demonstrates very profound knowledge on the subject. :D .. just kidding. it demonstrates lunacy or deliberate lie. I suspect it is latter...
 Ok, so what's the deal with this stereotypical rant? Let's look at it piece by piece.

1.) ""you cannot use it to explain natural world""
- Why? Hint: because given enough time anything is possible, and unlikely becomes certain. :D You see, for Scott, Miller on other Darwinists anything antithetical to Naturalistic process 'cannot be used to explain the world'. It is a matter of definition. They simply define what constitutes as acceptable for explanation and what does not. It is like saying, you have to explain things only in English, the moment you say a word in German or Russian, you're not talking about real world. What they do is they simply eliminate opposing view via creation of comfortable definitions. So why can't you use it to explain natural world, don't we use design inference now, and havn't we used it for centuries?
Intelligent Design is simply a method of inferring design from an artifact at hand. Whatever the artifact. We subject it to explanatory filter and using CURRENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE see if this artifact/phenomenon is designed or not. Designed inferred on the basis of knowledge, not on the basis of lack of knowledge, UNLESS of course knowledge is defined as 'only naturalistic processes are considered as adequate knowledge base'. Under such definition, if you find a 3000 year old coin, you better find ""real"" explanation for how natural forces produced it, or else you're not explaining natural world. This begs another question, where are the lines of demarcation between natural world and non-natural world. Why should biological systems be treated as naturalistically produced in the first place? Should not the evidence and knowledge drive the definitions, not vice versa? At this point in time methodological naturalistic assertions dictate how the information to be interpreted.
Tu summarize, natural world is explained in terms of known laws, forces, patterns, mechanisms, etc. And if current knowledge says something is designed, is it not objective to ascribe design where such property of a system is found? Furthermore, we already explain artifacts as being designed or not, so why then creators of this video lie to us?

2.) ""It's essentially a negative argument""
- How's that? If I were to find a 3000 year old coin, it would not be a negative argument to say it is designed. Makes little sense.

3.)""It says evolution doesn't work, therefore the designer did it.""
- I never heard this syllogism. No wonder. because Eugene Scott created it herself. First of all, it is not the best argument. and secondly nobody from ID uses it. A far better statement would be: ""evolution doesn't work. period"". Whether designer did it is related to how solid is the design inference, not how bad the evolution is. Evolution stand or falls on it's own. Design stands or falls on its own. Ironically, Darwinists like to accuse others of what they do themselves, especially when they ""criticize"" design as being imperfect or suboptimal. They argue of design is suboptimal, then it is not a design at all... well, go figure. It seems they like to do exactly what they attribute to opposition, and create straw men arguments.

4.)""Evolution doesn't work, therefore we win by default.""
- No. Evolution doesn't work means YOU lose. Who wins has to do with inference to the best explanation. Only IF this is dichotomy and it is shown that one side has inadequate case, then yes opposition would win, but if there are more than two options, it does not mean ID wins... It means Darwinists lose, and their archaic paradigm should be burred long time ago.

5.) ""But when you ask them, what does intelligent Design tell you about nature ?""
- Intelligent design tells whether an artifact/phenomenon shows patterns of design, or in other words displays characteristics attributed to designed artifact/phenomenon.
If I found 3000 year old coin, I know it was designed. That's as simple as that.

6.) "" Does it tell you what the designer did?
Does it tell you what the designer used to design something with?
Does it tell you what purpose the designer had for designing something?
Does it tell you when the designer did it?
Why the designer did it? it doesn't tell you anything like that.""
- Is this a red herring or what? If I were to find a 3000 year old coin, to infer design I would need to know first name, last name and address of a designer? Designer is IRRELEVANT. What at hand is differentiation a property of something as being designed or not. Perhaps designer died 3000 years ago, and I cannot know why and when and using which tools he designed a coin... it is irrelevant. When we look at some artifact, we simply determine if it designed or not. Who is a designer? Who designed the designer? What was a hair color of a designer? What was he eating? Where was he sleeping... etc are IRRELEVANT absolutely!

It never stops to amaze me how shallow and deceptive Darwinists are.

At about 30th minute Miller employs yet another favorite flick to give impression that ID is a unsubstantiated religion based mythology, and Darwinism is a synonym for ""science"". Very very typical rant, particularly addressed at majority of population who has never took a course in philosophy of science, nor read anything on the subject by proponents of ID.
Here we go:
@31:31 ""... truth is one. science and religion should ultimately be in harmony. But that doesn't make faith a scientific proposition. I think, as many religious people do, that faith and reason are both gifts from God. And if God is real, then faith and reason should complement each other rather than being in conflict."" Ok, what we have here is implicit assertion that critics of Darwinism are fall into 'subjective faith' camp which has nothing do with reality, and Darwinists like Miller are on the 'objective scientific' camp.
Here, we see YET ANOTHER straw man fallacy/lie about opponents of Darwinism. They are implicitly characterized as people who do not view faith and reason as being in harmony, but rather see reason [read Darwinism] and faith in conflict. Well, of course it begs the question why in the world is Darwinism became synonym for reason? Failure of Darwinism has to do with inadequacy to account for what we DO KNOW. What makes Miller think that it is Darwinism and not Intelligent Design which is reasonable?
Well, the honest and straight forward answer is that Miller has a priori methodological commitment to naturalistic evolution - aka Darwinism, and in his mind it is synonymous with reason. Why? Because it is how he defined it. It is yet another example of winning the argument by defining away your opponent. That is, ""Darwinism is synonymous with reason and science. I hold to Darwinism, hence I am reasonable scientist. You do not hold to Darwinism, means you're not reasonable and you're not scientist"". Silly tricks... continue.

So why 1.5 stars then [and not 1]? Well, there was some interesting attempts to debunk irreducible complexity of a flagellum, and I think attempt was far from successful. It was informative though [and I don't mean Miller, I mean the other guy]. Note however, that debunking of irreducible complexity was not very successful. It employed similarity in structure, as if they are similarity in function. Think about it for a moment. If Microsoft Word and Open Office are similar in that they are both executable and installable programs, does it prove they are related by common descent? I don't think so. [It may be true that to extent one was reverse engineered from the other, but that would only prove intelligent design of both, not disprove it].

If you need a video where Intelligent Design proponents DO SPEAK and you're interested in hearing them instead of watching circus like this, get 5 hour&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teaching-Origins-Objectively-5-Hour-Extended-Version/dp/B000PM8E88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teaching Origins Objectively (5+ Hour Extended Version)</a>. At least you can weigh the arguments for yourself without forcing upon you straw men fallacies created by proponents of dying Darwinian paradigm.

3036556,2,B000YY6VIC,"I wanted to learn some more facts supporting intelligent design but this film was slanted towards evolution.  It didn't say why most of the expert witnesses for intelligent design did not show up to testify for court or why there was a disagreement in the intelligent design legal team.  It's funny how we need to say intelligent design and not God.  BUT if people really want to see proof of a God then I would recommend visiting goodfight.org for proof of satan's influence on music because if there's no God then there would be no satan.  And last you can internet search for Kent Hovind for some good intelligent design facts. You can get his copyright free video's on ebay at great prices or search online to download them for free.  I know Kent Hovind is in prison now for tax reasons but in the Bible disciples were in prison and even Jesus himself who was perfect and without sin was convicted and killed.  And just because something is popular and widely supported like evolution doesn't make it true...just ask any 4 or 5 year old if santa exist or what happened to the flat earth that had the sun go around it.  Why did we believe in santa as kids...maybe because the people we trusted, the media, and our peers told us he was real and we believed the lie as truth.",1300320000,4,1276,4.450643776824034

I had never seen that before.  I'm sure it was an exact duplication of what really happened down to the final gesture...  It was pretty easy to find out who the good guys were.  All the evolution types were smart, well-spoken, and seemed to have good personalities.  The design people were not as good-looking, and had a harder time saying their lines.  They were more sweaty too.  I liked the judge.  He seemed wise and just, but kind of stern too, especially when the ID people stumbled around trying to back up the Christians.  I'm sure he was really busy and stuff, because he copied a lot of stuff into his ruling that the evolution people had to help him with, but being a Federal Judge is hard, even if it does take an act of Congress to fire you!  So I can't blame him for taking a short cut here and there, especially because now everybody thinks he's such a good judge and stuff.

One thing bothers me: why don't more people believe in evolution?  The article below is 5 years old, but it says that 85% of people think that God had a hand in the evolution of humans.  What's with that?

3036558,3,B000YY6VIC,"Judgment Day is a PBS documentary that examines the controversy over whether Dover, Pennsylvania, could teach Intelligent Design (ID) in its public schools. The film has many strong points including a great explanation of evolution for the layperson. There are also some good interviews with many of the case's participants.

The film doesn't rate any higher than three stars for several reasons. Judgment Day is simply too long at over 100 minutes. It should have been about an hour. Also, there were no cameras in the courtroom so the filmmakers hired actors and staged corny reenactments.

I am not a fan of ID, but I think that Judgment Day suffers from a lack of access to those who testified in support of ID. While not the filmmakers' fault, the lack of input  leaves the impression that Judgment Day does not explain the entire story. Finally, there is almost no comment from Dover students - an odd omission in a case about a school system's curriculum.

3036560,5,B000YY6VIC,"Why should evolution be antithetical to science? It doesn't have to be that way. A belief in science does not preclude a belief in God/Allah or other supreme presence.

This Nova episode describes exactly how the two can coexist - although that would seem to be the opposite of what the title presents. Science is a way of examining our world and religion is faith based. It is perfectly permissible to have both within in the same society - and have neither dominate the other.

Science says that theory is something that has been tested and will continue to exist until something is logically produced that invalidates it. In that sense there are no absolutes in science.

Religion is faith based and tends to resist change unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary - and even this is often not enough to produce a much change.

Both these methods of interacting with our fellow human beings have a place in our society and our lives. This DVD shows what can happen when a religion feels threatened by science and how reactions to that threat can damage our society. I would recommend this DVD, if only to examine how fear can corrupt our motives and how we must constantly guard our freedoms - lest we lose them through excess or inattention.",1265328000,7,1257,4.67420814479638

3036564,5,B000YY6VIC,"This documentary about the lawsuit brought by parents to overturn the policies put in place by the school board in Dover, Pennsylvania is an exceptionally fine summation of the fake debate between evolutionary thought and intelligent design. I say ""fake debate"" because there really is no debate. Evolution simply is science. To call it merely a theory is unbelievably deceptive, because there simply are no creationist scientific theories. As several people explain so well in this documentary, science always by its very nature falsifiable and makes predictions. Evolution, though falsifiable, has constantly been verified and supported by new evidence. It has also created many predictions that have been proven reliable as time has passed. None of this is true of Creationism. It is more or less an assertion that explains little and cannot really be verified, though in fact as a number of scientists have pointed out, the ""design"" of many animals seems quite unintelligent, as any human with an achy back can attest.

Intelligent Design is clearly Creationism, which is clearly an attempt to insert religion into science and courts have repeatedly upheld this. I really have no problem with the idea of a creator. In fact, I am a Christian who believes that God created life by establishing the method of evolution. In fact, there are many Christian scientists who believe this, perhaps most famously Francis Collins, formerly head of the Human Genome Project and currently the head of the National Institutes of Health. The roots for this are not really dealt with in this documentary, but those interested might consider looking at the really fine academic book THE DEATH OF ADAM: EVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON WESTERN THOUGHT. The book shows how Christians have resisted adjusting their beliefs -- beliefs that really are not central to the redemptive story of the death and resurrection of Jesus -- despite the growth of evidence for a different understanding of human origins.

The show details how Intelligent Design was deliberately repackaged from Creationism after it was declared unconstitutional in court decisions. Philosopher Barbara Forrest gives absolutely damning evidence that books were rewritten to try to skirt the court decisions. This testimony revealed the hypocrisy driving the Intelligent Design movement, which insists that it is science, while Creationism as clearly religious. Forrest also brings forth a document called The Wedge that promotes a strategy to remake society in religious terms. What disturbs me is that they can't do this in reasoned, balanced debate, so they have to do so by devious, deceptive methods. At a certain point my fellow Christians simply need to acknowledge the truth and adjust to it. Evolution has been proven as true as the vast majority of scientific theories. For me, as a person of faith, it doesn't lessen or challenge my belief in God, but apparently the faith of a huge number of Christians have an incredibly fragile faith.

The documentary features a dramatic reenactment of the trial as well as a host of the participants in the trial. The result is a brilliant accounting of the conflict between Christians who can't let go of a literal reading of the earliest chapters of Genesis (the first of which was written, by the way, as a creation hymn, not as science) and science. This is easily one of the best documentaries on the Dover School Board incident.

The film does leave out one important aspect of the trial and that is the influence that outside groups advocating Intelligent Design exerted in the event. Because the school district was sued, it had to pay the legal fees, doing enormous financial harm to the school district. Some on the Christian Right advocated an appeal, but the financial cost to the school district would have been devastating. Yet throughout it all, the Creationists (do we really need to continue to call it Intelligent Design?) simply fail to see the case. The problem they have really is not with Evolution, but with modernism. There is actually a broad-based counter-enlightenment at work in the work, that runs across a large number of irrationalist movements, from Christian and Islamic fundamentalism (both of which have arisen because of their adherents inability to cope with the modern world) to astrology to New Age thought to Jungian thought. The Creationists in this trial are one example of people unable to come to emotional terms with the modern world (and I do believe that the cause is psychological and emotional rather than rational). I have wondered how and if things will ever get better. Not everyone has had trouble adjusting. Most Europeans seem to have had no such problems. Nor most Canadians and Australians. The biggest problems really do seem to be in the United States, Latin America, African, and the Arab World. Institutions grounded in rationality, such as the court system, have proven bulwarks against emotional reactionaries. Let us all pray that at some point in the future we will get past this. But in the short run I'm not optimistic.",1258243200,7,5082,5.082634730538922
3036565,5,B000YY6VIC,"I'll try to keep this short, but I have a vested interest in this subject.  ""Judgement Day"" is a well-told documentary about the Dover trial and the cases specifically made in court.  It spotlights the continual dishonesty of the Creationist movement, especially striking hard with the Creationists' own words.  I was particularly amused by the fellow who, at the start of the film, was eager to have the judge decide on what was and wasn't science.  When the court ruling went against him, he announced that the judge had ""overstepped"" by deciding what was and what wasn't science.  The credibility whiplash was almost painful to watch.

So once again the Creationists and their leaders have been set back on their pins.  Not long afterwards they changed their tune to ""Let's Teach the Contraversy!"", and I am quite sure that it won't be long before they once again charge into the courts to try to ram their religious dogma into science classes.

They just don't get it.  In order for something to be accepted as science, all that must be done is a collection of evidence, a hypothesis drawn from that evidence, and then a test or series of tests designed to discover the accuracy or inaccuracy of the hypothesis.  That done, the hypothesis gets published in a peer-reviewed journal, where experts in the relevant field examine the hypothesis and the tests for flaws, and try to replicate the results.  If the hypotheses passes all this, then it becomes an acceptable scientific theory.

The Creationists keep trying to skip all that and want to go straight to the textbooks.  They provide no evidence beyond personal incredulity, have no tests that can produce any verifiable results (and in fact don't do any research at all), and have not ever tried to submit their efforts to peer review.  ""Judgement Day"" is a textbook demonstration of this in action, and illustrates the hollowness and idealized ignorance that characterizes the Creationist movement.",1236038400,9,1958,4.948012232415902
3036566,5,B000YY6VIC,"This documentary DVD reenacts in a very interesting way the events in 2004 and 2005 at Dover High School USA and the related court trial. It concerns the attempt of directors of a high school to try to sneak in a religious interpretation of the origin of the species into the science class of the Dover High School. Some parents and teachers reacted by filing a legal suit on gounds that what was termed as "" Intelligent Design "" an alternative to Charles Darwin's scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, was in fact "" Creationism "" in disguise i.e. a religious explanation of the origin of the species that refuted Darwin's theory that mankind is a descendant from apes.

While watching the DVD we learn in detail both about what Darwin's theory and the allegations of Intelligent Design are all about. The reenactments of testimonies of both sides in the court are very interesting. The verdict was the conviction of the school directors on grounds that they had lied in court, did in fact have ulterior motives to bring religion into education of science, which is forbidden by the American Constitution article requiring the secularity of the state and of education. The insistence of the defendants that they had no religious intentions that Intelligent Design was just an alternative scientific theory which they wanted the students to learn about besides Darwin's theory falls flat on its back when their most trusted ""scientist"" testifies in court that his definition of the scientific method includes Astrology...a proponent of Intelligent Design and the author of a book titled Darwin's Black Box.

For those who are not familiar with the Darwinian theory and Intelligent Design claims; according to Darwin all species have a common root and branched out into different species over time under the influence of environmental circumstances, some species adapted to the environment and others couldn't adapt and became extinct. Intelligent Design by contrast claims that some aspects of species are too complex to have arisen by evolution alone. Those aspects must have been designed by an intelligent agent ( God ). Different species came into existence suddenly and independently, they did not branch out from a common root. In court they present as evidence for Intelligent Design the  complex motor of a bacteria as something too complex to arise simply from Darwinian evolution. However, they can not prove their case. By contrast, the proponents of Darwin were able to show  some fossils in court as evidence of Darwinian theory. Moreover, even though there maybe non religious believers in the Intelligent Design concept, in the particular case at Dover religious motives were hidden behind it. Because the religious  intention to refute  homosapien evolution from apes was served by a concept that called itself Intelligent Design. In essence it turned out to be Creationism.

By the same line of reasoning those who believe in Darwinian Evolution don't necessarily have to be atheists. To theorize that the species evolved by natural selection from a common root is not to deny the existence of God. The Intelligent Designer of the Universe i.e. God may have designed  evolution  the way Darwin explained it, not the way Intelligent Design proponents claim. Moreover, the scientific community admits that there could be mistakes in Darwin's theories just like in any scientific theory. But those mistakes are to be discovered and changed by scientifc methods, not by throwing out the scientific method and replacing it by some kind of irrational religious thinking.

Scientific methodology and thinking have been the primary enemies of religious fundamentalism ever since Galileo challenged it centuries ago.  Since decades, many countries in the world including the USA have been requiring  a secular state and educational system as an indisputable article in their constitutions. Yet even in the 21st century in many countries and religions there are still significant numbers of people who want to overthrow the secular systems and replace them by religious fundamentalism. They are not necessarily bad intentioned people. They believe that what they want - a state based on religion and lifestyles controlled by religion only - are the right things to do. The sad thing is that their thinking is distorted and deprived of scientific enlightenement.

***Subsequent note*** March 16th 2009

By an interesting coincidence just one week after I watched this film anti- Darwinist Islamist Creationists made a move against Darwin in Turkey ; the monthly magazine of a government sponsored Turkish Scientific Research Organization in Turkey put Darwin's picture on the cover of the March 2009 issue and devoted 16 pages to him in commemoration of Darwin's 200th birth year. Immediately after this,the director of the organization purged the editor from the organization and had Darwin erased from the cover of the magazine. His justification was that the current situation in Turkey was too sensitive to tolerate Darwin on the cover of the magazine. For many days after this event  a strong reaction continued from the secular organizations and press in Turkey and internationally. Some Turkish secular organizations conducted protest demonstrations demanding the resignation of the directors of the government sponsored Scientific Research Organization who they claimed were  Islamist Creationists. The directors backed down and denied they had anything against Darwin. But the editor of the magazine who was purged subsequently claimed that the directors were lying, that she was told that she was fired for putting Darwin's picture  on the cover of the magazine and that she would take the matter to court.

3036567,5,B000YY6VIC,"Dover, PA, is a quiet town that could describe Anywhere, USA. Persons unknown burn a school mural, a labor of love from an artistically gifted student showing the evolution of man from ape to human. The town elects a new school board led by two creationists who have less than stellar interactive skills. They attempt to introduce intelligent design (I. D.) into the science class first through a book and through a statement to be read by every science teacher. When science teachers rebel and the school board meetings turn in to shout fests, it doesn't take long for both sides to line up for a legal battle that will attract observers from around the world. Both sides are confident they will prevail.

Since television cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, Nova recreates the testimony of several witnesses for both sides. The complainants must prove that I. D. is not science and must also prove that the intent of the board was to introduce creationism to the classroom. The defense will attempt to prove that intelligent design is a scientific theory just as evolution is, and has nothing to do with God or creationism.

The viewer also gets a rudimentary education in Evolution and Darwin's theory of natural selection through photos and graphic illustration. (Science class should have been this interesting)! Proponents of intelligent design have their advocates who are interviewed. Their main claim is a concept called ""irreducible complexity,"" which they attempt to explain through an example of the mechanics of the flagellum. They argue that the flagellum is such a complex structure that it could not have developed by evolution but by an intelligent agent. Eliminating any of its parts renders it useless.

The case for the defense soon falls apart for a number of reasons: Only three of their eight witnesses eventually show up because of dissension over how the defense should be argued. Fossil remains of an animal in transition from the sea to land are found, thus blowing the suggestion that evolution has unexplained gaps or lacks ""transitional"" fossil evidence. One witness disproves irreducible complexity, and the defense's star witness, Michael Behe has to concede that his own definition of science could include astrology. Worse, school board witnesses contradict themselves from their depositions to their testimony, and demonstrate no knowledge of intelligent design or evolution. The smoking gun is found in documents from the company that produced a book based on I. D. called ""Of Pandas and People."" Whole passages of the book are shown to have remained the same, with intelligent design substituted for creationism shortly after a landmark case of 1987 threw creationism out of the classroom.

The town has been polarized with relationships strained or friendships broken. The town votes the entire school board out of office four days after the trial ends. Lauri Lebo, local journalist, follows the trial and is firmly opposed to I. D. while her father is in favor of it. He will die three weeks after without reconciliation with his daughter regarding evolution. William Buckingham returns to his characteristic lack of composure over the judge's decision accusing him attending ""Clown College"" and missing the Constitution when it was taught in law school. Buckingham lacks even a college education. The judge suggests the district attorney investigate Alan Bonsell and William Buckingham for perjury. Death threats are made against Tammy Kitzmiller and Judge Jones. He finds that the complainants have proven all of their allegations and other communities that planned to introduce I. D. into their curricula will put that decision on hold. However, the very teacher-popular ""dragonfly"" biology book, so named because it has a picture of one on its cover, will limit the mention of evolution in subsequent editions. The town of Dover will have to heal from the fissures of opposing beliefs, and intelligent design will look for new challenges and victories somewhere else, somewhere Dover the rainbow.

Nova, a program of the Public Broadcasting System, brings you a factual account of the events without speculation or favoritism. It is what some of us wish that more of television would become, something that entertains and informs.

This is highly recommended. You might say this program actually gets better over time.

P. S.  The United States of America is the only civilized nation in the world where evolution is considered a matter of controversy.  One third to almost one half of Americans believe in creationism and reject evolution.

P. P. S.  Most creationists believe that evolutionists are atheist. This is a myth. To William Buckingham this was talking out of both sides of their mouths. It was a paradigm he could not resolve.

P. P. P. S. Charles Darwin was born February 12, 1809, the same day as Abraham Lincoln. When he started his discovery at age 22 he was a firm believer in the creation. Few people have had such profound influence on knowledge: Aristotle, Kopernik, Gallileo, Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein. Darwin is one of them.",1235606400,5,5105,5.122596153846154

3036569,4,B000YY6VIC,"I've just finished this video and as a Christian I have to say I was embarrassed by the case presented by the school board. This is a video more on how  not to present your case. This is a partial review and I'm still thinking over what was presented. The video is very good, definitely one sided. There is one point where they use the example of a mouse trap for disproving ""Irreducible Complexity"". They show the mouse trap as it was intended to be used, for catching mice. The point being a mouse trap only works if it's made all at once. One scientist in an attempt to prove this to be false, removes parts and says it can also be used as a tie clip. That's true, but then it wouldn't be useful for what it was designed to do....to catch mice. Some systems cannot evolve, they have to work from the beginning.

Something that caught my attention was the judgement against the school district. The parents and lawyers who sued the district were awarded over $1,000,000 in damages and legal fees. They won their right to ban intelligent design, but at the cost of taking money away from the school district. Thomas More Law Center, lawyers for the school district did not accept any fees, but the parents who sued and the ACLU got paid. Was it really worth the cost of suing?",1221955200,2,1277,4.406779661016949

3036572,5,B000YY6VIC,"If you are sick and tired of Religious fundamentalists denying the science of Evolution as first proposed by Charles Darwin in his seminal 1859 book ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection"" simply because they really don't understand the proven scientific hypothesis proposed by Darwin and later shown by James Watson and Francis Crick's discovery of the DNA molecule how Darwin was correct; even though Darwin did not know the actual mechanism of Evolution.  This NOVA documentary clearly explains both sides of a conflict of beliefs that's been in the news since the Scopes' ""Monkey Trial"" of 1925 in Tennessee.

On one side of this continuous issue stands the Nation's Religious Fundamentalists' devoutly held belief in the Creation story in the Bible's Book of Genesis, where it is stated that a supernatural Supreme Being created the heavens, the Earth, and all living creatures on the Earth.  Some of these devout Religious Fundamentalists want to call this Supreme Being an ""Intelligent Designer"" to side-step the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by labeling ""Intelligent Design"" as a ""science"" to supplant the theory of evolution now taught in high school biology classes.  On the other side of the issue are the parents of those high school students who believe their children's Constitutional rights would be violated if their biology books were altered to include the Creationists' viewpoint.  The Genesis account of Creation is true to the extent that God created life, but Genesis does not detail how.  Fortunately, the humans that were created were each given a brain with which to reason how life may have come about, and the other how's and whys of the other sciences as well.  Albert Einstein once stated:  ""I want to know God's mind, all the rest are just details"".  This NOVA documentary explains some of those details, and why Intelligent Design is Not a science.

3036573,5,B000YY6VIC,"The film documents the 2005 trial of a group of parents and teachers in Dover, PA. who sued the school board accusing them of violating the constituional separation of church and state. The dispute, which divided this small community of 20,000 into two very polarized groups, started when the school board required science teachers to read a statement to students that Intelligent Design (ID) was a viable alternative scientific theory to the theory of evolution and that books were available in the library which would give students more information about ID. These books had been anonymously donated to the school and became an integral part of the trial later on. The trial attracted national and international attention. An attorney for the plaintiffs stated, 'This is the case I've been waiting all my life for.."". The success of the plaintiffs rested on being able to prove two statements. One, they had to prove that ID was not a scientific theory according to generally accepted scientific principles. Two, they had to prove the school had religious motivation or purposes in requiring that ID be presented to students. The trial last six weeks and literally divided families in the community as people took sides. If you like legal movies you will enjoy the strategies of both sides as they make their cases. It was a fascinating trial. The trial was decided by a judge who was appointed by the Bush Administration which clearly had an ID bias. If you're interested in evolution versus ID, you will also find this fascinating. Remember, it is ID that is on trial, not the theory of evolution. Did this trial answer the questions forever regarding ID or was it a referendum on the Dover school board? You can decide. As the trial demonstrates, the science and faith communities are still far apart in understanding each other and recognizing the limitations and strengths of both. At the end, a couple surprise discoveries create a 'Perry Mason' style finish. Worth watching no matter which side of the debate you find yourself on.

3036574,5,B000YY6VIC,"This is a very nicely done DVD outlining the case of Kitzmiller et. al. v. Dover School Board. If you are reading this, you doubtless know the gist of the case: a handful of maverick school-board members decide to disapprove of the ""standard"" biology textbook (the ""Dragonfly"" book by Miller and Levine, which has been used for quite a while). Instead, they wnt to teach a more ""intelligent-design-friendly"" text and....a logal battle ensues.

This DVD is a very engaging recount of the trial's action. The most memorable part of the film - and what sets it apart from other films that profile the case - is that this one reenacts pieces of the case, using actors to read from the actual transcript. In other words, we actually get to watch the moment when Ken Miller (the co-author of the ""Dragonfly book"") tears the very Christian lawyer from the Thomas Moore Law Center to shreds over his ""just a thoery"" remark. It really happened, and now, we get to see it brought back to life. If you value science, you will find this as entertaining as I did.

While the film's goal is to primarily profile the case, it also serves as a great explanation and defense of evolution. We hear, for instance, about what makes evolution falsifiable, and some of the most recent 'tests' it has undergone (with flying colors). We get the cursory tour of genetics and how it operates as the fundamental mechanism of evolutionary theory.

But most of all, this film is about the trial. The passion of both sides is well captured through interviews with many of the participants: we hear both from board members and plaintiffs, the Thomas Moore Law Center and the ACLU. I do not want to say, hosever, that this film is balanced. (It is a pro-science program, and as such, it is very pro-evolution). It is helpful, though, to be able to put faces to names, and hear each person's perspective from their own mouths.

In the end, of course, creationism did what it does best: it lost out to science. In so many words, an astute philosopher named Barbara Forrest was able to demonstrate with conclusive evidence that Intelligent Design actually IS creationism revamped. Thus, the creationists' whole case was blown. But the emotion that surrounds this issue will doubtless be around for some time, resurfacing (and hopefully losing) many more times before it dies.

And this is a really good film to remind us all that it is battle very much alive.",1205452800,52,2424,4.721040189125295
3036575,5,B000YY6VIC,"This is an exceptional and engaging 2 hour dramatization (+ interviews ) of the debate over ID in a high school in Dover Pennsylvania.  For those who have seen the 8 hour PBS series Evolution, this is a nice companion piece, and much more riveting than the final disc of that set which explores the same controversy regarding the topic of 'equal time' for non scientific explanations or the origins of life in a HS science class.

I had heard quite a bit about this trial and read Miller's book 'Finding Darwin's God' before coming to this video, but was still unprepared for many aspects of the ID camp revealed here.

Throughout the course of this film it becomes increasingly clear that ID is nothing more than a rewording of Creationism (CDesign Proponentists)and the Discover Institute (who Michael Behe is intimately associated with)nothing more than a think tank for pushing their cultural agenda.

My opinion about Behe changed considerably upon seeing this film, and I have difficulty understanding how the Discovery Institute differs significantly from well-scorned groups like the Institute for Creation Research.  This documentary could have been greatly improved with the input of members of the Discovery Institute or Michael Behe, but neither of them appear (in fact, the whole ID side is mostly unrepresented in the film.)  Is NOVA simply too liberal or biased a program to appear on?  Given that ID has been touted as such an important new theory, ready to usher in a new paradigm of scientific thought; it seems remarkable that none of these scientists are willing to come forth on a program that does a good a job as possible at being even handed.

I return at last to that question of Behe...and I guess I am more concerned about this matter than the other.  When I visit local bookstores, I can find scattered about the science section several anti-evolution, anti-science books that are in general not written by scientists.  Behe seems the one person to not fall into this camp--seemingly an honest scientists who just can't see how Evolution can explain all the data (a legitimate sort of claim for an honest scientist to make); and here is where the film is most condemning, since it becomes impossible to perceive Behe like this anymore.  Those who are finding his books convincing (and we trust the scientific communities to honestly interpret the otherwise inaccessible body of scientific literature for us), should pay special attention to this film because it gives evidence for ulterior motives that are hard to dismiss.

When all is said and done, 'Judgment Day' is a strong documentary that touches on much more than science.  It is about the people of Dover, it is about the way certain organizations try to change culture, and it also makes for a great story.

...and one glance at the Discovery Institutes's web site tells us with certainty that Nova will have a sequel on their hands shortly.",1204416000,15,2929,4.902834008097166
3036576,5,B000YY6VIC,"As a Phd scientist, I can say that a lot of people (and certainly some of the reviewers) don't really know what constitutes science and what does not. It's also true that there is disagreement amongst scientists over what constitutes 'truth', 'reality' or a whole host of concepts that are not directly measureable. and THAT is the key word: science is about observables. If it cannot be measured it does not exist. and ofcourse people will misinterpret that statement too: 'does not exist' means does not fall within the boundaries of nature/ existence that are typically occupied by science.
And to clarify further - 'science' does NOT equal 'truth'. In addition, people don't really understand what a theory is. We are all familar with the 'theory of gravity' and yet, even though it is a theory, rest assured if you drop an object it will fall!
These people who advocate ID first need to understand what science is and what it is not before they start making uneducated comments about it.
Science operates on a 'truth by consensus basis'. That is, some 'fact' is generally accepted to be correct once sufficient evidence is collected. BUT that fact is never completely true - it is simply the best explanation put forth at the current time. For example, people continue to push the limits on the theory of relativity with additional experiments/ meausurements. why do they bother if relativity is accepted to be true? Partly because the underlying model proposed by Einstein works under certain conditions which may not always work. The applicability of the model is limited by the mathematics of the model.
A good example of where science has gone haywire is String Theory. To my knowledge, none of that stuff is directly measureable so why do we bother!?
To summarize: Science is not 'truth'. It is not 'reality'. It is a tool (consisting primarily of the english language and mathematics) that we use to interface with the physical world. It also works. ID does not and therefore cannot be taught alongside science. It can certainly be taught but not WITH science. People don't seem to understand the difference and this is a shortcoming of the education system: people may study chemistry and physics but that doesn't mean they necessarily understand what science actually is!",1202947200,12,2284,4.935064935064935
3036577,5,B000YY6VIC,"I recommend this documentary. While NOVA is science oriented, thus ID (creationism) doesn't get the NOVA backing (as the trial shows ID to be non-scientific) - they do portray arguments and illustration from both sides of the fence. This includes the very poor analogy of someone writing in the sand as being evidence for design just as the earth is evidence for design, etc which NOVA didn't rebut but left standing. The film progresses from the onset of the Dover incident to the verdict with interviews and dramatizations along the way.

It can be seen from other sources that creationists often twist, distort and otherwise deceive and this same behavior is caught in the Dover incident. Unfortunately, the creationists don't admit to this and just write off the judge as unfair, the portrayals unfair and the deceit as an honest mistake. The final interview with the school superintendent after the judge's decision is very revealing. The judge makes the point that you need not abandon faith to see what evidence provides us - evolution. The arguments and drama is enjoyable. Check it out...",1201046400,16,1097,4.994535519125683

NOVA outdoes itself in presenting  all sides of the issue with interviews of the players involved, and a compelling re-enactment of the ""closed"" court case based on the transcripts. I honestly could not remember what the outcome of their dilemma was, so JUDGMENT DAY had me riveted to the screen. There is a lot to learn about how ""science"" is defined and explained.

This was a real American town coming to blows with itself. The presentation is directly from testimony,so there is no bias in the presentation.

This documentary does a good job of presenting the issue in the space of an hour. Michael Behe refused to be interviewed for it but other creationists from the Discovery Institute and the Dover school board are interviewed as is Judge John E. Jones III.

The one thing that comes across is that this documentary could have been much stronger in tone that what it was. At Kitzmiller v. Dover the creationist cream of the crop (five of whom didn't even turn up), not only lacked a morsel of scientific rigor (any peer-review at all), and admitted this under oath, but acknowledged that they where wrong and conceded that their irreducibly complex models could have evolved. They rejected their own creationism and embraced evolution. This is not mentioned in the program so I feel it wasn't tough enough but even with what is here much of it will surprise, especially how underhanded the whole creationist agenda was with their wedge strategy.

It also reveals that evolutionists received death threats. So did the Judge.

It was clear about halfway through that many of the opponents to the theory of Evolution had very little understanding of what a scientific theory is.  They mentioned this in the documentary, but I wish that they would have given it a bit more time as I believe this is one of those fundamental misunderstandings that some have with science and how it works.

This is quite interesting attempt to lie on the subject.
Agenda as follows:
1.) Portray reenacted characters in a way where Darwinists are humble, meek and honest truth seekers and IDers as arrogant and/or ignorant. Here's a hint: turn of volume and observe body language, moves, behaviors, and guess who is Darwinist and who is ID proponent. :D Unbelievable manipulation!
2.) At ALL COSTS DO NOT LET proponents of ID to speak their mind. Interview ONLY Darwinists! In this video you will hear a lot of monologues from Miller, and Eugene Scott [who else? after all those are key trolls]k, but where are the other side? Oh I know, they are not allowed to speak, and even if they were, their speeches would be edited to extent that they would say anything you want...
3.) After #1 and #2 was successfully executed, add distorted or irrelevant information. Here's the best of all excerpt on the subject:
@1:40 [first minute 40th second] Scott says, ""the fundamental problem with Intelligent Design is that you cannot use it to explain natural world. It's essentially a negative argument. It says evolution doesn't work, therefore the designer did it. Evolution doesn't work, therefore we win by default. But when you ask them, what does intelligent Design tell you about nature ? Does it tell you what the designer did? Does it tell you what the designer used to design something with? Does it tell you what purpose the designer had for designing something? Does it tell you when the designer did it? Why the designer did it? it doesn't tell you anything like that. Basically it is negative argument. You can't built science on a negative argument.""
- Oh, I see...this demonstrates very profound knowledge on the subject. :D .. just kidding. it demonstrates lunacy or deliberate lie. I suspect it is latter...
 Ok, so what's the deal with this stereotypical rant? Let's look at it piece by piece.

1.) ""you cannot use it to explain natural world""
- Why? Hint: because given enough time anything is possible, and unlikely becomes certain. :D You see, for Scott, Miller on other Darwinists anything antithetical to Naturalistic process 'cannot be used to explain the world'. It is a matter of definition. They simply define what constitutes as acceptable for explanation and what does not. It is like saying, you have to explain things only in English, the moment you say a word in German or Russian, you're not talking about real world. What they do is they simply eliminate opposing view via creation of comfortable definitions. So why can't you use it to explain natural world, don't we use design inference now, and havn't we used it for centuries?
Intelligent Design is simply a method of inferring design from an artifact at hand. Whatever the artifact. We subject it to explanatory filter and using CURRENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE see if this artifact/phenomenon is designed or not. Designed inferred on the basis of knowledge, not on the basis of lack of knowledge, UNLESS of course knowledge is defined as 'only naturalistic processes are considered as adequate knowledge base'. Under such definition, if you find a 3000 year old coin, you better find ""real"" explanation for how natural forces produced it, or else you're not explaining natural world. This begs another question, where are the lines of demarcation between natural world and non-natural world. Why should biological systems be treated as naturalistically produced in the first place? Should not the evidence and knowledge drive the definitions, not vice versa? At this point in time methodological naturalistic assertions dictate how the information to be interpreted.
Tu summarize, natural world is explained in terms of known laws, forces, patterns, mechanisms, etc. And if current knowledge says something is designed, is it not objective to ascribe design where such property of a system is found? Furthermore, we already explain artifacts as being designed or not, so why then creators of this video lie to us?

2.) ""It's essentially a negative argument""
- How's that? If I were to find a 3000 year old coin, it would not be a negative argument to say it is designed. Makes little sense.

3.)""It says evolution doesn't work, therefore the designer did it.""
- I never heard this syllogism. No wonder. because Eugene Scott created it herself. First of all, it is not the best argument. and secondly nobody from ID uses it. A far better statement would be: ""evolution doesn't work. period"". Whether designer did it is related to how solid is the design inference, not how bad the evolution is. Evolution stand or falls on it's own. Design stands or falls on its own. Ironically, Darwinists like to accuse others of what they do themselves, especially when they ""criticize"" design as being imperfect or suboptimal. They argue of design is suboptimal, then it is not a design at all... well, go figure. It seems they like to do exactly what they attribute to opposition, and create straw men arguments.

4.)""Evolution doesn't work, therefore we win by default.""
- No. Evolution doesn't work means YOU lose. Who wins has to do with inference to the best explanation. Only IF this is dichotomy and it is shown that one side has inadequate case, then yes opposition would win, but if there are more than two options, it does not mean ID wins... It means Darwinists lose, and their archaic paradigm should be burred long time ago.

5.) ""But when you ask them, what does intelligent Design tell you about nature ?""
- Intelligent design tells whether an artifact/phenomenon shows patterns of design, or in other words displays characteristics attributed to designed artifact/phenomenon.
If I found 3000 year old coin, I know it was designed. That's as simple as that.

6.) "" Does it tell you what the designer did?
Does it tell you what the designer used to design something with?
Does it tell you what purpose the designer had for designing something?
Does it tell you when the designer did it?
Why the designer did it? it doesn't tell you anything like that.""
- Is this a red herring or what? If I were to find a 3000 year old coin, to infer design I would need to know first name, last name and address of a designer? Designer is IRRELEVANT. What at hand is differentiation a property of something as being designed or not. Perhaps designer died 3000 years ago, and I cannot know why and when and using which tools he designed a coin... it is irrelevant. When we look at some artifact, we simply determine if it designed or not. Who is a designer? Who designed the designer? What was a hair color of a designer? What was he eating? Where was he sleeping... etc are IRRELEVANT absolutely!

It never stops to amaze me how shallow and deceptive Darwinists are.

At about 30th minute Miller employs yet another favorite flick to give impression that ID is a unsubstantiated religion based mythology, and Darwinism is a synonym for ""science"". Very very typical rant, particularly addressed at majority of population who has never took a course in philosophy of science, nor read anything on the subject by proponents of ID.
Here we go:
@31:31 ""... truth is one. science and religion should ultimately be in harmony. But that doesn't make faith a scientific proposition. I think, as many religious people do, that faith and reason are both gifts from God. And if God is real, then faith and reason should complement each other rather than being in conflict."" Ok, what we have here is implicit assertion that critics of Darwinism are fall into 'subjective faith' camp which has nothing do with reality, and Darwinists like Miller are on the 'objective scientific' camp.
Here, we see YET ANOTHER straw man fallacy/lie about opponents of Darwinism. They are implicitly characterized as people who do not view faith and reason as being in harmony, but rather see reason [read Darwinism] and faith in conflict. Well, of course it begs the question why in the world is Darwinism became synonym for reason? Failure of Darwinism has to do with inadequacy to account for what we DO KNOW. What makes Miller think that it is Darwinism and not Intelligent Design which is reasonable?
Well, the honest and straight forward answer is that Miller has a priori methodological commitment to naturalistic evolution - aka Darwinism, and in his mind it is synonymous with reason. Why? Because it is how he defined it. It is yet another example of winning the argument by defining away your opponent. That is, ""Darwinism is synonymous with reason and science. I hold to Darwinism, hence I am reasonable scientist. You do not hold to Darwinism, means you're not reasonable and you're not scientist"". Silly tricks... continue.

So why 1.5 stars then [and not 1]? Well, there was some interesting attempts to debunk irreducible complexity of a flagellum, and I think attempt was far from successful. It was informative though [and I don't mean Miller, I mean the other guy]. Note however, that debunking of irreducible complexity was not very successful. It employed similarity in structure, as if they are similarity in function. Think about it for a moment. If Microsoft Word and Open Office are similar in that they are both executable and installable programs, does it prove they are related by common descent? I don't think so. [It may be true that to extent one was reverse engineered from the other, but that would only prove intelligent design of both, not disprove it].

It didn't say why most of the expert witnesses for intelligent design did not show up to testify for court or why there was a disagreement in the intelligent design legal team.  It's funny how we need to say intelligent design and not God.  BUT if people really want to see proof of a God then I would recommend visiting goodfight.org for proof of satan's influence on music because if there's no God then there would be no satan.

I know Kent Hovind is in prison now for tax reasons but in the Bible disciples were in prison and even Jesus himself who was perfect and without sin was convicted and killed.  And just because something is popular and widely supported like evolution doesn't make it true...just ask any 4 or 5 year old if santa exist or what happened to the flat earth that had the sun go around it.

All the evolution types were smart, well-spoken, and seemed to have good personalities.  The design people were not as good-looking, and had a harder time saying their lines.  They were more sweaty too.  I liked the judge.  He seemed wise and just, but kind of stern too, especially when the ID people stumbled around trying to back up the Christians.  I'm sure he was really busy and stuff, because he copied a lot of stuff into his ruling that the evolution people had to help him with, but being a Federal Judge is hard, even if it does take an act of Congress to fire you!  So I can't blame him for taking a short cut here and there, especially because now everybody thinks he's such a good judge and stuff.

The film has many strong points including a great explanation of evolution for the layperson. There are also some good interviews with many of the case's participants.

The film doesn't rate any higher than three stars for several reasons. Judgment Day is simply too long at over 100 minutes. It should have been about an hour. Also, there were no cameras in the courtroom so the filmmakers hired actors and staged corny reenactments.

I am not a fan of ID, but I think that Judgment Day suffers from a lack of access to those who testified in support of ID. While not the filmmakers' fault, the lack of input  leaves the impression that Judgment Day does not explain the entire story.

This Nova episode describes exactly how the two can coexist - although that would seem to be the opposite of what the title presents. Science is a way of examining our world and religion is faith based. It is perfectly permissible to have both within in the same society - and have neither dominate the other.

Science says that theory is something that has been tested and will continue to exist until something is logically produced that invalidates it. In that sense there are no absolutes in science.

Religion is faith based and tends to resist change unless there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary - and even this is often not enough to produce a much change.

Both these methods of interacting with our fellow human beings have a place in our society and our lives.

3271061,5,B000YY6VIC,"This documentary about the lawsuit brought by parents to overturn the policies put in place by the school board in Dover, Pennsylvania is an exceptionally fine summation of the fake debate between evolutionary thought and intelligent design. I say ""fake debate"" because there really is no debate. Evolution simply is science. To call it merely a theory is unbelievably deceptive, because there simply are no creationist scientific theories. As several people explain so well in this documentary, science always by its very nature falsifiable and makes predictions. Evolution, though falsifiable, has constantly been verified and supported by new evidence. It has also created many predictions that have been proven reliable as time has passed. None of this is true of Creationism. It is more or less an assertion that explains little and cannot really be verified, though in fact as a number of scientists have pointed out, the ""design"" of many animals seems quite unintelligent, as any human with an achy back can attest.

Intelligent Design is clearly Creationism, which is clearly an attempt to insert religion into science and courts have repeatedly upheld this. I really have no problem with the idea of a creator. In fact, I am a Christian who believes that God created life by establishing the method of evolution. In fact, there are many Christian scientists who believe this, perhaps most famously Francis Collins, formerly head of the Human Genome Project and currently the head of the National Institutes of Health. The roots for this are not really dealt with in this documentary, but those interested might consider looking at the really fine academic book THE DEATH OF ADAM: EVOLUTION AND ITS IMPACT ON WESTERN THOUGHT. The book shows how Christians have resisted adjusting their beliefs -- beliefs that really are not central to the redemptive story of the death and resurrection of Jesus -- despite the growth of evidence for a different understanding of human origins.

The show details how Intelligent Design was deliberately repackaged from Creationism after it was declared unconstitutional in court decisions. Philosopher Barbara Forrest gives absolutely damning evidence that books were rewritten to try to skirt the court decisions. This testimony revealed the hypocrisy driving the Intelligent Design movement, which insists that it is science, while Creationism as clearly religious. Forrest also brings forth a document called The Wedge that promotes a strategy to remake society in religious terms. What disturbs me is that they can't do this in reasoned, balanced debate, so they have to do so by devious, deceptive methods. At a certain point my fellow Christians simply need to acknowledge the truth and adjust to it. Evolution has been proven as true as the vast majority of scientific theories. For me, as a person of faith, it doesn't lessen or challenge my belief in God, but apparently the faith of a huge number of Christians have an incredibly fragile faith.

The documentary features a dramatic reenactment of the trial as well as a host of the participants in the trial. The result is a brilliant accounting of the conflict between Christians who can't let go of a literal reading of the earliest chapters of Genesis (the first of which was written, by the way, as a creation hymn, not as science) and science. This is easily one of the best documentaries on the Dover School Board incident.

The film does leave out one important aspect of the trial and that is the influence that outside groups advocating Intelligent Design exerted in the event. Because the school district was sued, it had to pay the legal fees, doing enormous financial harm to the school district. Some on the Christian Right advocated an appeal, but the financial cost to the school district would have been devastating. Yet throughout it all, the Creationists (do we really need to continue to call it Intelligent Design?) simply fail to see the case. The problem they have really is not with Evolution, but with modernism. There is actually a broad-based counter-enlightenment at work in the work, that runs across a large number of irrationalist movements, from Christian and Islamic fundamentalism (both of which have arisen because of their adherents inability to cope with the modern world) to astrology to New Age thought to Jungian thought. The Creationists in this trial are one example of people unable to come to emotional terms with the modern world (and I do believe that the cause is psychological and emotional rather than rational). I have wondered how and if things will ever get better. Not everyone has had trouble adjusting. Most Europeans seem to have had no such problems. Nor most Canadians and Australians. The biggest problems really do seem to be in the United States, Latin America, African, and the Arab World. Institutions grounded in rationality, such as the court system, have proven bulwarks against emotional reactionaries. Let us all pray that at some point in the future we will get past this. But in the short run I'm not optimistic.",1258243200,7,5082,5.082634730538922
3271062,5,B000YY6VIC,"I'll try to keep this short, but I have a vested interest in this subject.  ""Judgement Day"" is a well-told documentary about the Dover trial and the cases specifically made in court.  It spotlights the continual dishonesty of the Creationist movement, especially striking hard with the Creationists' own words.  I was particularly amused by the fellow who, at the start of the film, was eager to have the judge decide on what was and wasn't science.  When the court ruling went against him, he announced that the judge had ""overstepped"" by deciding what was and what wasn't science.  The credibility whiplash was almost painful to watch.

So once again the Creationists and their leaders have been set back on their pins.  Not long afterwards they changed their tune to ""Let's Teach the Contraversy!"", and I am quite sure that it won't be long before they once again charge into the courts to try to ram their religious dogma into science classes.

They just don't get it.  In order for something to be accepted as science, all that must be done is a collection of evidence, a hypothesis drawn from that evidence, and then a test or series of tests designed to discover the accuracy or inaccuracy of the hypothesis.  That done, the hypothesis gets published in a peer-reviewed journal, where experts in the relevant field examine the hypothesis and the tests for flaws, and try to replicate the results.  If the hypotheses passes all this, then it becomes an acceptable scientific theory.

The Creationists keep trying to skip all that and want to go straight to the textbooks.  They provide no evidence beyond personal incredulity, have no tests that can produce any verifiable results (and in fact don't do any research at all), and have not ever tried to submit their efforts to peer review.  ""Judgement Day"" is a textbook demonstration of this in action, and illustrates the hollowness and idealized ignorance that characterizes the Creationist movement.",1236038400,9,1958,4.948012232415902
3271063,5,B000YY6VIC,"This documentary DVD reenacts in a very interesting way the events in 2004 and 2005 at Dover High School USA and the related court trial. It concerns the attempt of directors of a high school to try to sneak in a religious interpretation of the origin of the species into the science class of the Dover High School. Some parents and teachers reacted by filing a legal suit on gounds that what was termed as "" Intelligent Design "" an alternative to Charles Darwin's scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, was in fact "" Creationism "" in disguise i.e. a religious explanation of the origin of the species that refuted Darwin's theory that mankind is a descendant from apes.

While watching the DVD we learn in detail both about what Darwin's theory and the allegations of Intelligent Design are all about. The reenactments of testimonies of both sides in the court are very interesting. The verdict was the conviction of the school directors on grounds that they had lied in court, did in fact have ulterior motives to bring religion into education of science, which is forbidden by the American Constitution article requiring the secularity of the state and of education. The insistence of the defendants that they had no religious intentions that Intelligent Design was just an alternative scientific theory which they wanted the students to learn about besides Darwin's theory falls flat on its back when their most trusted ""scientist"" testifies in court that his definition of the scientific method includes Astrology...a proponent of Intelligent Design and the author of a book titled Darwin's Black Box.

For those who are not familiar with the Darwinian theory and Intelligent Design claims; according to Darwin all species have a common root and branched out into different species over time under the influence of environmental circumstances, some species adapted to the environment and others couldn't adapt and became extinct. Intelligent Design by contrast claims that some aspects of species are too complex to have arisen by evolution alone. Those aspects must have been designed by an intelligent agent ( God ). Different species came into existence suddenly and independently, they did not branch out from a common root. In court they present as evidence for Intelligent Design the  complex motor of a bacteria as something too complex to arise simply from Darwinian evolution. However, they can not prove their case. By contrast, the proponents of Darwin were able to show  some fossils in court as evidence of Darwinian theory. Moreover, even though there maybe non religious believers in the Intelligent Design concept, in the particular case at Dover religious motives were hidden behind it. Because the religious  intention to refute  homosapien evolution from apes was served by a concept that called itself Intelligent Design. In essence it turned out to be Creationism.

By the same line of reasoning those who believe in Darwinian Evolution don't necessarily have to be atheists. To theorize that the species evolved by natural selection from a common root is not to deny the existence of God. The Intelligent Designer of the Universe i.e. God may have designed  evolution  the way Darwin explained it, not the way Intelligent Design proponents claim. Moreover, the scientific community admits that there could be mistakes in Darwin's theories just like in any scientific theory. But those mistakes are to be discovered and changed by scientifc methods, not by throwing out the scientific method and replacing it by some kind of irrational religious thinking.

Scientific methodology and thinking have been the primary enemies of religious fundamentalism ever since Galileo challenged it centuries ago.  Since decades, many countries in the world including the USA have been requiring  a secular state and educational system as an indisputable article in their constitutions. Yet even in the 21st century in many countries and religions there are still significant numbers of people who want to overthrow the secular systems and replace them by religious fundamentalism. They are not necessarily bad intentioned people. They believe that what they want - a state based on religion and lifestyles controlled by religion only - are the right things to do. The sad thing is that their thinking is distorted and deprived of scientific enlightenement.

***Subsequent note*** March 16th 2009

By an interesting coincidence just one week after I watched this film anti- Darwinist Islamist Creationists made a move against Darwin in Turkey ; the monthly magazine of a government sponsored Turkish Scientific Research Organization in Turkey put Darwin's picture on the cover of the March 2009 issue and devoted 16 pages to him in commemoration of Darwin's 200th birth year. Immediately after this,the director of the organization purged the editor from the organization and had Darwin erased from the cover of the magazine. His justification was that the current situation in Turkey was too sensitive to tolerate Darwin on the cover of the magazine. For many days after this event  a strong reaction continued from the secular organizations and press in Turkey and internationally. Some Turkish secular organizations conducted protest demonstrations demanding the resignation of the directors of the government sponsored Scientific Research Organization who they claimed were  Islamist Creationists. The directors backed down and denied they had anything against Darwin. But the editor of the magazine who was purged subsequently claimed that the directors were lying, that she was told that she was fired for putting Darwin's picture  on the cover of the magazine and that she would take the matter to court. The issue is still hot in Turkey on the newspapers everyday as I write these lines.",1235952000,9,5820,5.234156820622986
3271064,5,B000YY6VIC,"Dover, PA, is a quiet town that could describe Anywhere, USA. Persons unknown burn a school mural, a labor of love from an artistically gifted student showing the evolution of man from ape to human. The town elects a new school board led by two creationists who have less than stellar interactive skills. They attempt to introduce intelligent design (I. D.) into the science class first through a book and through a statement to be read by every science teacher. When science teachers rebel and the school board meetings turn in to shout fests, it doesn't take long for both sides to line up for a legal battle that will attract observers from around the world. Both sides are confident they will prevail.

Since television cameras were not allowed in the courtroom, Nova recreates the testimony of several witnesses for both sides. The complainants must prove that I. D. is not science and must also prove that the intent of the board was to introduce creationism to the classroom. The defense will attempt to prove that intelligent design is a scientific theory just as evolution is, and has nothing to do with God or creationism.

The viewer also gets a rudimentary education in Evolution and Darwin's theory of natural selection through photos and graphic illustration. (Science class should have been this interesting)! Proponents of intelligent design have their advocates who are interviewed. Their main claim is a concept called ""irreducible complexity,"" which they attempt to explain through an example of the mechanics of the flagellum. They argue that the flagellum is such a complex structure that it could not have developed by evolution but by an intelligent agent. Eliminating any of its parts renders it useless.

The case for the defense soon falls apart for a number of reasons: Only three of their eight witnesses eventually show up because of dissension over how the defense should be argued. Fossil remains of an animal in transition from the sea to land are found, thus blowing the suggestion that evolution has unexplained gaps or lacks ""transitional"" fossil evidence. One witness disproves irreducible complexity, and the defense's star witness, Michael Behe has to concede that his own definition of science could include astrology. Worse, school board witnesses contradict themselves from their depositions to their testimony, and demonstrate no knowledge of intelligent design or evolution. The smoking gun is found in documents from the company that produced a book based on I. D. called ""Of Pandas and People."" Whole passages of the book are shown to have remained the same, with intelligent design substituted for creationism shortly after a landmark case of 1987 threw creationism out of the classroom.

The town has been polarized with relationships strained or friendships broken. The town votes the entire school board out of office four days after the trial ends. Lauri Lebo, local journalist, follows the trial and is firmly opposed to I. D. while her father is in favor of it. He will die three weeks after without reconciliation with his daughter regarding evolution. William Buckingham returns to his characteristic lack of composure over the judge's decision accusing him attending ""Clown College"" and missing the Constitution when it was taught in law school. Buckingham lacks even a college education. The judge suggests the district attorney investigate Alan Bonsell and William Buckingham for perjury. Death threats are made against Tammy Kitzmiller and Judge Jones. He finds that the complainants have proven all of their allegations and other communities that planned to introduce I. D. into their curricula will put that decision on hold. However, the very teacher-popular ""dragonfly"" biology book, so named because it has a picture of one on its cover, will limit the mention of evolution in subsequent editions. The town of Dover will have to heal from the fissures of opposing beliefs, and intelligent design will look for new challenges and victories somewhere else, somewhere Dover the rainbow.

Nova, a program of the Public Broadcasting System, brings you a factual account of the events without speculation or favoritism. It is what some of us wish that more of television would become, something that entertains and informs.

This is highly recommended. You might say this program actually gets better over time.

P. S.  The United States of America is the only civilized nation in the world where evolution is considered a matter of controversy.  One third to almost one half of Americans believe in creationism and reject evolution.

P. P. S.  Most creationists believe that evolutionists are atheist. This is a myth. To William Buckingham this was talking out of both sides of their mouths. It was a paradigm he could not resolve.

P. P. P. S. Charles Darwin was born February 12, 1809, the same day as Abraham Lincoln. When he started his discovery at age 22 he was a firm believer in the creation. Few people have had such profound influence on knowledge: Aristotle, Kopernik, Gallileo, Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein. Darwin is one of them.",1235606400,5,5105,5.122596153846154

There is one point where they use the example of a mouse trap for disproving ""Irreducible Complexity"". They show the mouse trap as it was intended to be used, for catching mice. The point being a mouse trap only works if it's made all at once. One scientist in an attempt to prove this to be false, removes parts and says it can also be used as a tie clip. That's true, but then it wouldn't be useful for what it was designed to do....to catch mice. Some systems cannot evolve, they have to work from the beginning.

Something that caught my attention was the judgement against the school district. The parents and lawyers who sued the district were awarded over $1,000,000 in damages and legal fees. They won their right to ban intelligent design, but at the cost of taking money away from the school district.

On the other side of the issue are the parents of those high school students who believe their children's Constitutional rights would be violated if their biology books were altered to include the Creationists' viewpoint.  The Genesis account of Creation is true to the extent that God created life, but Genesis does not detail how.  Fortunately, the humans that were created were each given a brain with which to reason how life may have come about, and the other how's and whys of the other sciences as well.  Albert Einstein once stated:  ""I want to know God's mind, all the rest are just details"".  This NOVA documentary explains some of those details, and why Intelligent Design is Not a science.

3271070,5,B000YY6VIC,"The film documents the 2005 trial of a group of parents and teachers in Dover, PA. who sued the school board accusing them of violating the constituional separation of church and state. The dispute, which divided this small community of 20,000 into two very polarized groups, started when the school board required science teachers to read a statement to students that Intelligent Design (ID) was a viable alternative scientific theory to the theory of evolution and that books were available in the library which would give students more information about ID. These books had been anonymously donated to the school and became an integral part of the trial later on. The trial attracted national and international attention. An attorney for the plaintiffs stated, 'This is the case I've been waiting all my life for.."". The success of the plaintiffs rested on being able to prove two statements. One, they had to prove that ID was not a scientific theory according to generally accepted scientific principles. Two, they had to prove the school had religious motivation or purposes in requiring that ID be presented to students. The trial last six weeks and literally divided families in the community as people took sides. If you like legal movies you will enjoy the strategies of both sides as they make their cases. It was a fascinating trial. The trial was decided by a judge who was appointed by the Bush Administration which clearly had an ID bias. If you're interested in evolution versus ID, you will also find this fascinating. Remember, it is ID that is on trial, not the theory of evolution. Did this trial answer the questions forever regarding ID or was it a referendum on the Dover school board? You can decide. As the trial demonstrates, the science and faith communities are still far apart in understanding each other and recognizing the limitations and strengths of both. At the end, a couple surprise discoveries create a 'Perry Mason' style finish. Worth watching no matter which side of the debate you find yourself on.

3271071,5,B000YY6VIC,"This is a very nicely done DVD outlining the case of Kitzmiller et. al. v. Dover School Board. If you are reading this, you doubtless know the gist of the case: a handful of maverick school-board members decide to disapprove of the ""standard"" biology textbook (the ""Dragonfly"" book by Miller and Levine, which has been used for quite a while). Instead, they wnt to teach a more ""intelligent-design-friendly"" text and....a logal battle ensues.

This DVD is a very engaging recount of the trial's action. The most memorable part of the film - and what sets it apart from other films that profile the case - is that this one reenacts pieces of the case, using actors to read from the actual transcript. In other words, we actually get to watch the moment when Ken Miller (the co-author of the ""Dragonfly book"") tears the very Christian lawyer from the Thomas Moore Law Center to shreds over his ""just a thoery"" remark. It really happened, and now, we get to see it brought back to life. If you value science, you will find this as entertaining as I did.

While the film's goal is to primarily profile the case, it also serves as a great explanation and defense of evolution. We hear, for instance, about what makes evolution falsifiable, and some of the most recent 'tests' it has undergone (with flying colors). We get the cursory tour of genetics and how it operates as the fundamental mechanism of evolutionary theory.

But most of all, this film is about the trial. The passion of both sides is well captured through interviews with many of the participants: we hear both from board members and plaintiffs, the Thomas Moore Law Center and the ACLU. I do not want to say, hosever, that this film is balanced. (It is a pro-science program, and as such, it is very pro-evolution). It is helpful, though, to be able to put faces to names, and hear each person's perspective from their own mouths.

In the end, of course, creationism did what it does best: it lost out to science. In so many words, an astute philosopher named Barbara Forrest was able to demonstrate with conclusive evidence that Intelligent Design actually IS creationism revamped. Thus, the creationists' whole case was blown. But the emotion that surrounds this issue will doubtless be around for some time, resurfacing (and hopefully losing) many more times before it dies.

And this is a really good film to remind us all that it is battle very much alive.",1205452800,52,2424,4.721040189125295
3271072,5,B000YY6VIC,"This is an exceptional and engaging 2 hour dramatization (+ interviews ) of the debate over ID in a high school in Dover Pennsylvania.  For those who have seen the 8 hour PBS series Evolution, this is a nice companion piece, and much more riveting than the final disc of that set which explores the same controversy regarding the topic of 'equal time' for non scientific explanations or the origins of life in a HS science class.

I had heard quite a bit about this trial and read Miller's book 'Finding Darwin's God' before coming to this video, but was still unprepared for many aspects of the ID camp revealed here.

Throughout the course of this film it becomes increasingly clear that ID is nothing more than a rewording of Creationism (CDesign Proponentists)and the Discover Institute (who Michael Behe is intimately associated with)nothing more than a think tank for pushing their cultural agenda.

My opinion about Behe changed considerably upon seeing this film, and I have difficulty understanding how the Discovery Institute differs significantly from well-scorned groups like the Institute for Creation Research.  This documentary could have been greatly improved with the input of members of the Discovery Institute or Michael Behe, but neither of them appear (in fact, the whole ID side is mostly unrepresented in the film.)  Is NOVA simply too liberal or biased a program to appear on?  Given that ID has been touted as such an important new theory, ready to usher in a new paradigm of scientific thought; it seems remarkable that none of these scientists are willing to come forth on a program that does a good a job as possible at being even handed.

I return at last to that question of Behe...and I guess I am more concerned about this matter than the other.  When I visit local bookstores, I can find scattered about the science section several anti-evolution, anti-science books that are in general not written by scientists.  Behe seems the one person to not fall into this camp--seemingly an honest scientists who just can't see how Evolution can explain all the data (a legitimate sort of claim for an honest scientist to make); and here is where the film is most condemning, since it becomes impossible to perceive Behe like this anymore.  Those who are finding his books convincing (and we trust the scientific communities to honestly interpret the otherwise inaccessible body of scientific literature for us), should pay special attention to this film because it gives evidence for ulterior motives that are hard to dismiss.

When all is said and done, 'Judgment Day' is a strong documentary that touches on much more than science.  It is about the people of Dover, it is about the way certain organizations try to change culture, and it also makes for a great story.

...and one glance at the Discovery Institutes's web site tells us with certainty that Nova will have a sequel on their hands shortly.",1204416000,15,2929,4.902834008097166
3271073,5,B000YY6VIC,"As a Phd scientist, I can say that a lot of people (and certainly some of the reviewers) don't really know what constitutes science and what does not. It's also true that there is disagreement amongst scientists over what constitutes 'truth', 'reality' or a whole host of concepts that are not directly measureable. and THAT is the key word: science is about observables. If it cannot be measured it does not exist. and ofcourse people will misinterpret that statement too: 'does not exist' means does not fall within the boundaries of nature/ existence that are typically occupied by science.
And to clarify further - 'science' does NOT equal 'truth'. In addition, people don't really understand what a theory is. We are all familar with the 'theory of gravity' and yet, even though it is a theory, rest assured if you drop an object it will fall!
These people who advocate ID first need to understand what science is and what it is not before they start making uneducated comments about it.
Science operates on a 'truth by consensus basis'. That is, some 'fact' is generally accepted to be correct once sufficient evidence is collected. BUT that fact is never completely true - it is simply the best explanation put forth at the current time. For example, people continue to push the limits on the theory of relativity with additional experiments/ meausurements. why do they bother if relativity is accepted to be true? Partly because the underlying model proposed by Einstein works under certain conditions which may not always work. The applicability of the model is limited by the mathematics of the model.
A good example of where science has gone haywire is String Theory. To my knowledge, none of that stuff is directly measureable so why do we bother!?
To summarize: Science is not 'truth'. It is not 'reality'. It is a tool (consisting primarily of the english language and mathematics) that we use to interface with the physical world. It also works. ID does not and therefore cannot be taught alongside science. It can certainly be taught but not WITH science. People don't seem to understand the difference and this is a shortcoming of the education system: people may study chemistry and physics but that doesn't mean they necessarily understand what science actually is!",1202947200,12,2284,4.935064935064935
3271074,5,B000YY6VIC,"I recommend this documentary. While NOVA is science oriented, thus ID (creationism) doesn't get the NOVA backing (as the trial shows ID to be non-scientific) - they do portray arguments and illustration from both sides of the fence. This includes the very poor analogy of someone writing in the sand as being evidence for design just as the earth is evidence for design, etc which NOVA didn't rebut but left standing. The film progresses from the onset of the Dover incident to the verdict with interviews and dramatizations along the way.

It can be seen from other sources that creationists often twist, distort and otherwise deceive and this same behavior is caught in the Dover incident. Unfortunately, the creationists don't admit to this and just write off the judge as unfair, the portrayals unfair and the deceit as an honest mistake. The final interview with the school superintendent after the judge's decision is very revealing. The judge makes the point that you need not abandon faith to see what evidence provides us - evolution. The arguments and drama is enjoyable. Check it out...",1201046400,16,1097,4.994535519125683
3271075,5,B000YY6VIC,"I remembered the 2004 mess in Dover,Pennsylvania when a small town literally imploded on itself over the issue of adding ""intelligent design"" to the curriculum of their High School. NOVA outdoes itself in presenting  all sides of the issue with interviews of the players involved, and a compelling re-enactment of the ""closed"" court case based on the transcripts. I honestly could not remember what the outcome of their dilemma was, so JUDGMENT DAY had me riveted to the screen. There is a lot to learn about how ""science"" is defined and explained. To me,  evolution vs.intelligent design is a total non-issue,so for me to watch neighbor turn against neighbor,father turn against daughter,and friend threaten and lie to another friend, and religion get all mixed in fascinated me to know end. This was a real American town coming to blows with itself. The presentation is directly from testimony,so there is no bias in the presentation. The result does not show a bias, as much as it shows the problem that confronts the Constitution when it comes to these kinds of debates,and how they are ruled upon. Ultimately,this DVD showed man's inhumanity to man. To quote from a song by The Supremes,""Where did our love go?""Where Dover? Where?",1200873600,12,1235,4.990291262135922
3271076,5,B000YY6VIC,"This proves why Intelligent Design is really just creationism with a new name and how creationists have tried to subvert scientific progress by manipulating the facts for a religious agenda. This is happening all over the world today, but this trial exposed the ID movement for what it is and shows why.

This documentary does a good job of presenting the issue in the space of an hour. Michael Behe refused to be interviewed for it but other creationists from the Discovery Institute and the Dover school board are interviewed as is Judge John E. Jones III.

The one thing that comes across is that this documentary could have been much stronger in tone that what it was. At Kitzmiller v. Dover the creationist cream of the crop (five of whom didn't even turn up), not only lacked a morsel of scientific rigor (any peer-review at all), and admitted this under oath, but acknowledged that they where wrong and conceded that their irreducibly complex models could have evolved. They rejected their own creationism and embraced evolution. This is not mentioned in the program so I feel it wasn't tough enough but even with what is here much of it will surprise, especially how underhanded the whole creationist agenda was with their wedge strategy.

It also reveals that evolutionists received death threats. So did the Judge.

This is a good documentary on the topic, however I also recommend BBC Horizon A war on science - 2006 for even more detail and live footage of some of the events.",1198195200,18,1488,4.778210116731517
3271077,5,B000YY6VIC,"While it's obvious that Nova has a bias toward science, I think the documentary did a good job of giving air time to those on both sides of the issue in this documentary on the Dover trial on Evolution vs Intelligent Design.  They did dramatize court room testimony, but it was taken from court transcripts so I would assume the dialog to be fairly accurate.  It was clear about halfway through that many of the opponents to the theory of Evolution had very little understanding of what a scientific theory is.  They mentioned this in the documentary, but I wish that they would have given it a bit more time as I believe this is one of those fundamental misunderstandings that some have with science and how it works. Science is simply the best means we have for finding out the truth.  So if Nova is bias toward science, you could say that they are simply bias toward the truth.",1195862400,45,880,4.48125

The evolutionist Bible, Darwins ORIGIN of the Species, cannot even offer a plausible explanation for the ultimate origin (i.e. the complex single cell).  So desperate are they for an ultimate answer that leading evolutionist, Richard Dawkins, has even suggested panspermia.  This feeble theory, of course, begs the question:  Well, what then is the origin of the first aliens?

Nor can the evolutionists explain how the Big Bang was possible in the absence of a creator God.
