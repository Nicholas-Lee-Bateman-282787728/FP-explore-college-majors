4395826,5,B004K6FS52,"mandrake is an awesome movie it has gore,action,and guns.
the gore part is cool like a vine going throuh the guy's chest and blood splaters everywhere.
the action part is the running scenes like the three people getting away from the plant.
the gun part has pistols and submachine guns also a rife AWESOME!
and you have to give this movie some credit because it ended in a happy way so give it some credit,PLEASE!",1301011200,3,413,4.52

8432475,5,B004K6FS52,Great movie if you like ghost that or trees its about an indian cure it really was pretty good I enjoyed it so will you,1414022400,,119,3.8
8432476,2,B004K6FS52,"There really isn't a mandrake in the story. There is a plant that kills people, a cross between Treebeard and that thing on ""Evil Dead."" A rich man sends out a team to recover a dagger, a family heirloom that is 500 years old. They are able to find the grave and the dagger easily. Upon removing the dagger they release a curse which includes an evil tree creature. There are also natives in this area that sacrifice trespassers. Everyone fights everyone.

Betsy Russell provides the token eye candy in this made for TV movie. Some blood, some killing, a little horror. No bad language, sex, or nudity. Great movie to let the kids watch before going out on the nature trail. Otherwise, you might want to avoid.",1313193600,,710,4.546875
8432477,1,B004K6FS52,This isn't it. A friend of mine rented this piece of garbage and I watched it. I'm glad I didn't rent it. A bunch of crazy jungle tribe natives capture people and sacrificing them to a very bad special effect jungle god. You know what is scary? Not the movie but the fact that some people out there that might actually enjoy this time waste.,1311897600,,341,4.2615384615384615
8432478,1,B004K6FS52,"TV style production with CGI that any high school art/computer graphics department could create in weeks -  this time it's a stalking tree. Help!!
Acting from people you've never heard of or that no studios are interested in (translation: over the hill).
Directing was adequate given their challenge was filming within a mile or so of what was basically a Boy Scouts camp in some southern US forest.
Story retold, perhaps a dozen times, in the past 50 years of a mixed group of scientists and profiteers looking for a lost relic with consequences when they find it. Not too original there!
Native Peoples that were clothed with armor (huh!) and body/facial paint that looked like it came out of televised wrestling or the NFL. Truly, comedic relief.

Straight to DVD to make up for the $20,000 in production costs.

Watch Shaun the Sheep afterwards to cleanse yourself.",1310688000,,869,4.858108108108108
8432479,4,B004K6FS52,"It's good to see horror movies ""going green!"".  Or brown?  Anyway, the monster in this thriller is a monstrous plant with killer vines/roots/tentacles.  Louisiana subs for tropical jungles and the results are pretty much what you'd expect---a good cheesy movie reminiscent of the 50's ""classics"" like THE MONOLITH MONSTERS or DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS.
We have the standard characters for plant food:  the stalwart mercenary sent to find an ancient knife; the sexy anthropologist; the nerdy historian; the heartless billionaire who wants the knife and assorted natives who talk funny.
The CGI effects aren't trend-setting but not awful.  Not having great expectations, I wasn't disappointed with MANDRAKE.  Max Martini and SAW's Betsy Russell give professional perfprmances and the film moves fairly fast.  Will I remember it six months from now?  Remember what?  OOOps!!",1307491200,2,865,5.443609022556391
8432480,4,B004K6FS52,"A guilty pleasure, this is pure intellectual junk food.  Will you learn anything by watching it?  No.  Will watching it rot your brain?  No.  It's a basic, run of the mill, pseudo-monster flick that plays it safe.  I happen to like my ""monster"" movies uncomplicated so it suits me just fine.  I could easily watch this one over and over again.
There weren't too many egregious flaws except for the bit about this taking place in a jungle.  The credits say otherwise: it was filmed entirely on location....in Louisiana!  Far cry from a jungle, few trees or anything else for anyone or anything to hide behind but they still kept getting surprised by things popping up in the `jungle.'  The all important dagger didn't look all that special either.  I've seen fancier dinnerware!
Okay, I was wrong; it did illustrate an important lesson to be learned.  If you're going to open a `tomb', read the small print on the outside of it first: especially if it's a WARNING.

I thought it was a hoot and as such, it's a keeper!",1304812800,4,1016,4.5777777777777775
8432481,3,B004K6FS52,well its kinda different in the story line on new creature but same oh stuff. maybe it gets better on the second viewing that does happen sometimes,1304640000,3,147,4.481481481481482
8432482,4,B004K6FS52,"This is a syfy movie but it's not a joke or parody it's an actual serious sci-fi/horror movie.  It's basically a riff on The Ruins except no teenagers and less production values.  You have the same set-up as all these types of syfy movies with a team being assembled to go find some ancient artifact then it awakens some type of ancient evil.  It's watchable, the cgi isn't awful on the ""creature"", and the acting is pretty good for this type of movie.  Definite rental if you feel like watching a monster tree rip people in half; who doesn't?",1302652800,5,543,4.454545454545454
8432483,3,B004K6FS52,"Mandrake is about what you would expect for most SyFy Channel movies released to DVD. While it at least has a hint of originality, it's far from anything that you would expect to see in theaters.

Mandrake follows a former soldier who leads a group of archaeologists through the jungles of Latin America, in search of an ancient relic. Along the way, they must deal with angry local tribesmen, a supernatural forest, and a cursed tree monster.

The good news is that the film is actually shot well, with decent cinematography. Mandrake was filmed in my home state, so the visuals are appealing (though it's easy to see it's a Louisiana forest rather than a South American jungle.)

The bad news is that the story is all over the place. At first it's difficult to understand the relationship between the local tribe and the possessed jungle, and there are more than a few plot holes that keep things confusing.

There's an awful lot of unimpressive CGI used in the film, which gives it a low-budget feel. Thought the lighting effects in the film were great (especially the torch scenes), it's painfully obvious whenever there's a shot that involved a green screen.

Most of the cast is made up of obscure TV actors, with the exception of Benito Martinez (David Aceveda from The Shield), Max Martini from The Unit, and the amazingly beautiful Betsy Russell from most of the Saw movies.

Mandrake reminded me a bit too much of Congo, especially with respect to one character's unexplained obsession with finding a certain relic. For the most part, none of the characters have any depth, it's hard to sympathize for any of them.

I give Mandrake points for at least coming up with a slightly unique story, though it loses points for weak writing, overuse of CGI, and unimpressive acting performances. Worth a rent if you have some time to kill, but I'd wouldn't recommend buying this on DVD.",1302652800,6,1887,4.752293577981652
