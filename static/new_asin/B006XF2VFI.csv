It's a little disappointing because the Gaiam website mentions ""Green Bay"" in its press release for the DVD.  It's not hiding under ""The Quest Begins"" or ""Side of City"" titles either.  Anyone else who is looking for the Green Bay episode should look elsewhere.",1457308800,,623,5.138613861386139

8506310,4,B006XF2VFI,"While this series follows the formula of Man vs. Food, it loses something having other people take the challenges instead of Adam.  Also, the episodes feel sort of rushed and compacted.  Adam's charm does seem to make the series enjoyable though.  If you like Man vs. Food, you'll like this too.  If not, get the first 3 seasons.",1384905600,,329,4.620689655172414
8506311,5,B006XF2VFI,"Adam Richman hits it out of the park with this spin-off of ""Man v. Food"" by taking us to different cities and getting fans involved.
I just wish the episodes were an hour long, and showed more of what each city had to offer BESIDES food...",1377129600,,239,4.217391304347826

I just love Adam ethusiasm & the way he spurs other people on to the biggest food challenges in the USA.
I love it!! A hole lot of fun. Eat Big & have a good time!!",1368316800,,416,4.085365853658536
