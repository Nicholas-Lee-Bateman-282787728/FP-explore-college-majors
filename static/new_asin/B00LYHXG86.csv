8669025,1,B00LYHXG86,"I had high hopes for this video. 1950's sci-fi movies,drive-ins,nostalgia. Even the cover looked promising. Then I made the mistake of putting it my player. This is one of the most amateurishly produced videos I have ever seen. From the poorly chosen music which was not only incongruous but also constantly grating, to the wishy-washy voice of the narrator, this was a complete and utter disappointment. If I had seen this on YouTube for free I might have only considered it a waste of my time---but I paid good money for this. Do yourself a favor and don't waste either of yours.",1463443200,5,581,4.705882352941177

Also it is NOT a DVD , it's a DVD-R .they repackage with a very nice artwork cover and then you see a trailer festival same footage taking from the 50's segment of midnight madness REAL DVD just some minor re-editing.",1428019200,4,287,4.76
8669028,5,B00LYHXG86,"Delightful collection of ""trailers"" AKA previews of the classic monsters that filled the drive ins and coined the term ""teenager"" and made Atomic Mutation cool !.  For the younger viewers, this is the perfect way to wet an appetite to start collecting these movies that never get shown when you are ready for one! And,,, it makes a perfect ""party tape"".",1424995200,2,353,4.786885245901639
8669029,5,B00LYHXG86,"Now watching this brought back some really very pleasant memories for me of seeing many of these films in the late 1950's and early 60's in theaters and on T.V. way before cable, satellite, internet, and dvd's. Such a pleasure to see many of the films represented by movie trailers and clips. Even though by today's special effects standards, many of the films seem a little ""cheesy"" now but for me as well as many other ""monster kids"", Friday nights and Saturday mornings could not come fast enough to see these films on the New York/New Jersey television stations of WPIX (channel 11), WWOR (Channel 9), WNEW (Channel 5), and sometimes on CBS,, and ABC (channe's 2 and 7)...Those were the days...",1420243200,3,698,4.729508196721311
8669030,4,B00LYHXG86,"This is a awe-inspiring documentary about all those 1950s movies that may have lacked a budget,But not creative ambitions to entertain.

A wonderful cast of interviewees who were there : Samuel Z. Arkoff,Roger Corman ,Robert Wise,Rex Reason,Lori Nelson,Kevin McCarthy,Robert Clarke,Dolores Fuller and lots of famous fans that remind us of their & our favorite parts of the Atomic Age of Film-dom.

These documentaries from the Svehlas are getting tighter on editing and more thematic as they go and really show the best of the past.

There are special tributes to The Drive-In and Famous Monsters magazine.",1417910400,8,606,5.291666666666667
