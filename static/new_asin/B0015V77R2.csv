8260062,1,B0015V77R2,"If only I had seen the review from 'Peppy', who bought the 2005 version of this DVD, before wasting my money on this joke. He explains it perfectly:

""After hearing how great the method of Total Biology emotional clearing was from a friend of mine I looked forward to receiving the DVD in order to gain some insights into how it worked and how to apply it to my own life. This DVD supplied none of that and was an absolute joke. The author stumbles along with very poor English attempting to describe some cases that he had worked with in very simple terms and giving no structure or form as to how Total Biology is to be practiced or applied. The interviewer is no help at all and it becomes painfully obvious after the first 5 minutes that they needed the help of a translator. This DVD is a waste of money and the worst purchasing decision I have made in decades...you have been warned. It became the butt of jokes for days afterwards by the 4 of us that sat down to view it. It was so poor that it has forced me into writing this review - my first ever - in order to warn potential buyers.""

I've learned alot about the theory Sabbah and some other guys build their 'Total Biology' (or 'Biogenealogy', and so forth) on: an invention by Dr. Hamer around 1980, which he first called 'New Medicine', but later turned into 'German New Medicine' (after more and more people started to call their alternative therapies 'New Medicine' too).

As far as I can see, the only thing Sabbah (and others) added to it is that people might inherit a predisposition for certain psychological conflicts (which causes physical - and even mental - illnesses) from their mother, father or other 'ancestors'. This could explain the fact that for instance diabetes or cancer 'runs' in some families more than in others. Whatever may be the case, once you know how German New Medicine (GNM) works, it really doesn't matter much, because when you resolve the psychological trauma that triggered a specific 'biological emergency program' (which, for instance, causes cell growth in a certain organ, say a woman's breast - which doctors then call 'cancer'), a second biological (repairing) program starts cleaning up the damage (in this case, the breast tumor stops growing and is taken apart by small microscopic organisms (bacteria)). [...]

Hope this has been of some help (saved you some money and, I truly hope, maybe even alot of bodily harm by keeping you away from conventional medicine, which, to me, for cancer translates to 'cut/poison/burn'). In the end, it's your decision, of course. A life changing one...

Anyway, wish all you people the best!
