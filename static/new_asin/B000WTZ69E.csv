Let me start off by saying that I am no small woman.  (size 20)
It starts with a warm-up.  The warm-up will get you not just stretched but your heart rate up a little.
There are three sections in the middle. You can do all three or pick one to do between cool down and warm up.
One of them is a cardio one.  She does each exercise for just about 30 seconds before moving on to another one so I never get board.  I do have a hard time keeping up sometimes but I don't see it as a problem because I'm moving like mad no matter if I'm doing it exactly or not.
Another of them is a combination of toning and cardio.  Again, she changes to a different exercise so often you don't get bored with doing the same things.  I like this part the best and do it when I just want to do one.  I think I could do this part for every work out.  It is a nice balance.
The third one is a core workout -- Pilates style. Well, it's all kind of pilates style but you'll find yourself on your feel more through out the video than this third workout.
The cool down is GREAT -- It stretches you perfectly and brings your heart rate down to normal.
The girl has a pleasant voice.  There is a second girl there doing modified versions of the exercises for the harder ones.  You can follow her until you work up to following the leader.
The scenery is nice. They are on what looks like a balcony and you see the sky above.
And just in case it's not obvious -- You need to buy or have a ball to use with this. It does not come with one.
For an added bonus: The packaging is ""green"".  Environmentally friendly -- no plastic.",1207526400,9,1662,4.006060606060606
