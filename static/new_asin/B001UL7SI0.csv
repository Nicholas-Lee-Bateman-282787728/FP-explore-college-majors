3802989,4,B001UL7SI0,"Arnold Miller capitalized on the trend in mondo filmaking with his 1965 documentary London In The Raw. With taglines screaming ""The World's  Greatest City Laid Bare"" he helped to usher in an English version of the popular Italian genre.

Looking at the film some 48 years later what we get is a tame, very British look at London nightlife in the mid-1960's. There are a few segmenys meant to shock and some nudity (a gym scene, a hair transplant for shock value) but most of the film's short run time is devoted to a sort of London club tour. The places we visit give us a brief view into what life was like back then The film is a pleasant historical document and the BFI should be thanked for bringing such a rare film to the general public.

As part of its Flipside Collection the BFI has presented a great package for those looking for some of England's more offbeat films. The set is one of its dual packages offering the film in both a Blu Ray and standard definition DVD. The print is almost perfect and quite possibly better than most would have seen it on release. The color is vibrant and the sound is clear. The true value of this release also lies in the assembled bonus features. There are three ""London Sketches"" all by filmmakers Peter Davis and Staffan Lamm: Pub(1962), Chelsea Bridge Boys(1966) and Strip(1966) which provide a grittier feeling look at the principal material. There is a shorter alternate cut of the film presumably created for international distribution with different and somewhat more explicit footage and a great booklet featuring an essay and biographies of the filmakers.

This is once again a great package and a great historical document that is well worth the price of admission even if the world's greatest city is not exactly laid bare.",1382313600,,1780,4.677316293929713

8344214,2,B001UL7SI0,"This seedy movie, with an announcer who has a tour guide voice, shows you just how crazy and whacky London could be in the 1960s. Beatniks eating cat food, off-license establishments, precision dance stools and incomprehensible cockney singers. Add some breasts and you still don't have a lot here.",1418774400,,298,5.1020408163265305
8344215,2,B001UL7SI0,"Actually I'll give it two belches. Seriously there is nothing shocking or risqu, not that I was searching for it, unless breasts, belly dancers, and hipsters eating tinned cat food excite you. We're led to believe this is London's seamier underbelly, but I fail to see why women working out in a health club or a balding man getting hair plugs (graphic) is seedy. Watch for the club featuring a woman in green glitter eyeshadow/green dress looking like a swamp fog, as she intros a Cockney with Austin Powers teeth. Good if you're in a group, looking for something to make fun of, nothing too adult (though breasts seem to be a fixation for the producer), and to get ideas for an Ugly Hat Party.",1418774400,,695,4.568
