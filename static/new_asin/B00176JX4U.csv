He felt like the cheap, dirty little boy he had always known himself to be. Youtube makes prostitutes of all it's viewers. It's a fact. Look it up for yourself (WAIT! COME BACK!) Ok, so maybe it's not the kind of ""fact"" that you're used to, the kind that is supported by ""evidence"". Or maybe it is, I wouldn't know. Did you actually try looking it up? Seriously? What did you find? Really? That's disgusting. I can't imagine why pictures like that ended up in your search result, but here's a tip: you should clear your browsing history. Don't your kids use that computer too? I hope you at least wipe it down when you're done. Yeah that's true, dogs will eat pretty much anything. Try smelling his breath. Oh please, like you don't know exactly what that smells like.",1499040000,,942,4.4508670520231215

8265066,5,B00176JX4U,"One of the single funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

Rejected is a collection of really weird animation shorts that are all tied together into a cohesive story (though you'll find the word cohesive to be ironic once you see the film).

The 'plot' is that an animator created a bunch of cartoons that were rejected by a fictional TV network. Due to the rejections, the animator's work got progressively worse with each new animated short. By worse, I mean weirder.

This story is told as part of a bigger animation sequence that ties all the shorts together in a very funny way.

The entire film is done to look like black ink on plain paper with the occasional splash of color. (I am a banana) The paper is used as part of the animation where you see wrinkles and the torn edges of spiral note paper. It's all works as a magnificent indie animation film.",1423180800,,862,4.436708860759493
8265067,5,B00176JX4U,"This animated DVD is very funny but also very short in length. That being said, if you can get it at a low price (under $10 shipped) it is worth it.",1357603200,,148,3.806451612903226
8265068,4,B00176JX4U,This is quite possibly one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. If you like dark humor you will enjoy these animated clips of disturbing but adorable characters. Definatly not disappointing.,1207699200,,202,4.970588235294118
