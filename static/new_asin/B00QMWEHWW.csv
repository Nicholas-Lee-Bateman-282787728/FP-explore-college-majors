8692055,4,B00QMWEHWW,"Mill Creek Entertaining is releasing Remake Rewind DVDs this month, featuring the original and redone of several movies. One of the DVDs features the 1950 classic film noir D.O.A. and the 1988 remake of the same name. There are no special features or extras on the disc.

1950 film follows an accountant, Frank Bigelow (played by Edmond O'Brien), taking a vacation a much needed vacation. One night he stops by the nightclub ""The Fisherman,"" and unnoticed to him, a stranger swaps drinks with him. He wakes up the next morning feeling a bit ill, so he visits a local doctor who informs him that he has been poisoned. The doctor gives him even more grim news - he has about 48 hours to live. With time running out, he is determined to find out who poisoned him and why.

The 1988 remake follows a similar storyline with a few twists, the film now follows Professor Dexter Cornell (played Dennis Quaid) finding himself being poisoned at a nightclub. With less than 36 hours to live, he goes to visit his soon-to-be-divorced ex-wife, Gail (played by Jane Kaczmarek), but he arrives just as she is being murdered. The killer knocks him out from behind. When he wakes up, he is surrounded by the police, whom all are convinced that he killed his wife.

Before they can handcuff him, he makes an escapes and seeks refuge at one of his students's, Sydney Fuller (played by Meg Ryan), dorm room. With her help, Dexter investigates the suicide of  his student, Nick Lang (played by Robert Knepper), and unravels a disturbing conspiracy that may or may not be linked to his poisoning.

As a kid, I use to watch the 1988 D.O.A. over and over again, but I was unaware that it was a remake until I reviewed this DVD release. While I did enjoy watching the 1950 version this week, I still have prefer the remake as it has more of an intense plot and Dennis Quaid's character is far more interesting. Considering there are two movie shoved onto one disc, the film quality is pretty decent. Overall, I have enjoyed watching both D.O.A. films on the Remake Rewind DVD.
