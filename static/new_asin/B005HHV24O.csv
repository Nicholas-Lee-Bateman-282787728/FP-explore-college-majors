8472981,1,B005HHV24O,"A psychotic man attempt to deal with his past, one where apparently his mother died in child birth. Films where killers attempt to deal with their past are fine, but seriously the whole movie? Nearly 2 hours filled with piece meal flash backs and symbolism is not entertaining. This was an extremely boring indie. I know we all get high from time to time and come up with ideals like, ""What if we did a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" film with a Joni Mitchell soundtrack?"" But when we come down, we discard the notion.

Not recommended for viewing.",1382486400,2,543,4.597938144329897

8472983,5,B005HHV24O,"Even though this is an independant film by first-time filmmakers I was amazed by how great the film looked. The lighting is near perfect, very lugubrious and creepy I love the film's uncompromisingly gloomy aesthetic and atmosphere. The narrative is... well not really a narrative at all, rather the story plays out like a series of nightmarish sequences loosely connected by a mystery that the main character has to solve. One of the things I liked best about this film is the performance of the lead actor, newcomer Jon Stoley. He is explosive and expressive and does a first-rate job of conveying a mix of fear and confusion; that said I think he could have handled the emotional scenes a little better so as to draw out some sympathy from the audience in crucial moments like when he is trapped by the head of his Father in a fish tank making what I can only describe as hideous cunnilingual
overtures to his own son - yep this warped sort of logic is typical for the Rutley brother's debut feature.

For me the best thing about Where the Dogs Divide Her is the sound - dark oppressive attacks of screams, hisses and crazed drones combined with some truly exceptional song - chief among these are songs by American singer/songwriter Kristeen Young; and the songs performed by the astonishing nightclub singer - incidentally the best scene in the whole movie.

If you like your David Lynch more 'Lynchian' and your Tarkovsky more 'arty' then you should definitely see this unique indie film.",1322092800,,1494,4.742307692307692
8472984,4,B005HHV24O,"I began watching this film thinking i was going to be treated to the same old cliches that many modern horror films rely on. However, what i watched was a very original piece of film-making that takes inspiration from cult classics like 'Erazor Head' and 'Evil Dead' whilst contributing its own ideas in the process.
The film at times made me feel like i had taken magic mushrooms and then had a freak out. Nevertheless, I could not divert my eyes for fear of missing the truth that the main character was so desperate to uncover.",1322006400,,530,4.53125
