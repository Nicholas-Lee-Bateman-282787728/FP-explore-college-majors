8243296,1,B00120LPQA,"This set has been cancelled by WWE. First Sting, then Randy Savage, and now this set. I give a big middle finger to Vince and the WWE. This is a slap in the face to wrestling fans. The set to replace it is Kane..KANE!? What the hell has Kane done since 2004? He's boring and stale. KANE!!!!!! WTF?!?!?!? This is bullcrap. I mean come on here is a set of dvd sets the WWE should release, not including the ones cancelled.

Batista? Ricky Steamboat? JBL-Yes, people hate this guy but he has a good story and some good matches. Randy Orton? Best of Tag Teams?

I mean holy cow, so much money to be made WWE. Quit screwing the fans that pay you billions for your products.",1221177600,4,668,4.251968503937008
