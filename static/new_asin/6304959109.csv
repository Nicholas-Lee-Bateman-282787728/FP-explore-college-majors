944017,4,6304959109,"My 4 year old was diagnosed with High Functioning Autism PDD-NOS, and has a speech delay. I checked this video out from the library, and my son LOVED it. He actually learned the ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" nursery rhyme from it! I've been able to build upon it and help his speech, as well. It's one of the earlier Blue's Clues, but what stood out to me was how it seemed to click with my son.",1050883200,12,385,4.1466666666666665
944018,5,6304959109,"Steve does a great Elvis impersonation. This is also one of the more fun videos that we have watched. Kids are encouraged to participate during the video to help solve the problem. Higher order thinking skills, creative thinking, ordering, prediction and more. If you do allow your child to watch tv, this is a good one for the two year old and up range.
Enjoy.",1035072000,12,361,4.569230769230769
944019,5,6304959109,"I can't say enough about this video. My son inherited it from his 6 yr. old cousin who has know outgrown Blue and Steve.  He wants to watch this every day! every night!  It is his favorite next to Winnie the Pooh.
Even though this video came out a few years ago, Blue's Clues still seems to be in the loop for toddler entertainment.
My son is 18 months and totally adores this. Even though he can't completely follow everything, it is still very good at helping him acquire learning skills.  He is already repeating a lot of the words that he hears, and gets his hips shaking along with Steve's.
Fun music, animation, and dancing...highly recommend this one!!

944020,5,6304959109,"My 2 year-old son is a big fan of Blues Clues, and ever since I bought this video, it keeps him totally captivated! It seems to be a little more interactive than some of the others - the interaction in this one is familiar (""Jack & Jill"" and other easy nursery rhymes are repeated with fill-in-the-blank portions). Overall, very basic and appropriate for a toddler with budding language skills. Also, of course, it's entertaining & fun!",1027382400,5,436,4.75
944021,5,6304959109,"My two year old son adores Steve and Blue.  This tape breaks familiar stories down into ""clues"" for the kids to figure out.  My little one never gets tired of it and as a parent I appreciate it because children  have to THINK to solve the puzzle.
I reccomend Blue's Clues to anyone who  has young children and has grown tired of the ""old standby"" shows  that they usually watch.",916876800,3,378,4.3428571428571425
