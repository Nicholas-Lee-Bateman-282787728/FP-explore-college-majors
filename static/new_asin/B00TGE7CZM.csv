8701615,4,B00TGE7CZM,"When a promising young Korean actress, on the verge of making it big, is implicated in a sex scandal involving a married politician by an online ""tipsheet"", the woman's suicide sends her manager, Woo-gun (Kang-woo Kim), into a tailspin of despair.  Not only was she his only client, they'd worked together from her first days of trying to break in and had also become the best of friends.  Guilt and his conviction of her innocence drive Woo-gun to dig deeper into who started the false rumor and why, and as he strives to clear her name the hapless manager also uncovers an intricate, dangerous web of lies, political conspiracy, story swapping that can destroy the innocent and hide the guilty - even as Woo-gun's efforts also put him directly in the sites of those out to silence him.  Though a bit slow in its first third, Tabloid Truth picks up steam fast and has a rousing, surprising finale that will have your pulse racing one minute and eyes glistening with a tear or two the next.  Again, no one does thrillers quite like South Korea. (from my blog, sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,,1091,4.756613756613756
