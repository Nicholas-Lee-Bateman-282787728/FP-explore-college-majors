His supporting cast give outstanding performances that draw you in even if you are not a fan of the genre.

1665646,4,B00005UM21,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie together, even though it is low budget and poorly made.  It was actually fun to watch for the script supervisor and editor's failures.  For example, it's broad daylight when the young lovers begin a brief conversation on a skyscraper's roof; then it's suddenly night. Did their conversation last that long?  If not, how about a montage to show us the passage of time?

Is the naked girl having sex with the gangster his Chinese bodyguard?  The hair doesn't match at all!

Where did the girl with the huge nipples behind the crime boss go?  The girl with him now has tiny nipples!

Perhaps the most hilarious elements in this film are the band of sibling assassins with clown make-up on.  The elder brother has a a Samurai dagger, which his brother and sister have full sized Samurai swords.  They do little song and dance routines which lead you to not take take them seriously, until they draw their swords and dagger.  Since the elder brother stands so far out in front, their victims suddenly find themselves facing an even row of blade points!

Besides the hilarity of this film, it also has multiple, deep psychological conflicts.  Should the Red Dragon's daughter kill her boy friend, who is a member of the gang that raped her mother (or other female family member) and killed her father?  Should her boy friend kill her when he finds out she's the person who has been killing his fellow gang members?  Should his boss kill him for defending his girl friend?  Does the Chinese bodyguard forgive her boss for shooting her when he hallucinates and mistakes her for the Red Dragon?  Will our young lovers live happily ever after?

Why is the Red Dragon's daughter wearing her lover's sports jacket a the end of the film, or is it a cheap Korean copy?

For answers to these and other questions, we might need to re-watch this hilarious Japanese film!",1455062400,,1893,4.647590361445783

1665659,4,B00005UM21,I got this movie with Once Upon a Time in China for $5. So I cannot complain at all. This version was dubbed. The script and story is do cheesy that it will make you laugh. The dubbed voices are hilarious. One of the Kung Fu older females sounds like a Yiddish woman from the Bronx. But.....the choreography is mesmerizing. The video quality is excellent and sound DTS 5.1. This is not a masterpiece like Hero. But rip-roaring fun...don't spend more than a couple of bucks on this film.,1380240000,,486,4.47191011235955

1665681,4,B00005UM21,"One of the greatest bad movies of all time, Legend of the Red Dragon defines goofy martial arts films.  Some of the dubbing choices are truly bizarre, and often add to the overall humor. ""All right eat up; you kids be sure to get your potassium"" is one of my favorites. A villain at the beginning of the film actually picks up a log from a log cabin, and swings it around like it's nothing. If that weren't enough, the hero takes his ""magic spear"" and drills all the way through the log length-wise! This is just scratching the surface!

I like it because it is consonant with my philosophy that often, law is too slow and direct revenge is therefore is not always unjustifiable. In Osaka, members of Kurosawa kai, a Japanese mafia group, are being slaughtered. According to the police investigation, the victims were cut in half by a sharp sword and it is obvious that these homicides have been committed by a professional. One of the officers of Kurosawa Kai, Aramaki, seeks to catch the killer: however, the number of victims rises. Clues start to come to the forefront during this investigation which raises suspicions that  these are vengeful crimes by 'sekiryu' (the red dragon).

1665686,3,B00005UM21,"Japanese action films, especially the ones that have a low budget, have usually carried the usual theme of vengeance ever since the inception of ""pink violence"" in their films. They usually have a very simple plot and the action it delivers may go from mild to ultra violent-- that uses some blood splattering effects, sex and nudity with the usual theme of betrayal and vengeance. ""LEGEND OF THE RED DRAGON: Woman of Vengeance"" (aka. Sekiryu No Onna, 2006) is a mild entry into the pink violence genre as directed by Toru Ichikawa.

In a small town in Osaka, a mass serial murder targeting the Japanese mafia- Kurosawa Kai are occurring in waves. According to the police files, the victims were murdered with the use of a very sharp sword by someone with an uncanny ability to wield such a weapon. Aramaki (Kenichi Endo), one of the officers of the mafia clan resolves to find the killer; but the body count continues to rise as does his anxiety. A clue surfaces that is related to ""sekiryu"" (red dragon)--it awakens an ominous memory: The truth behind the brutal murder of the Asahina family and the shadow of vengeance--a lone survivor. A woman raised by a legendary swordsman named Yui (beauteous Yu Misaki) steps forward to exact her revenge...

Sounds pretty cardboard doesn't it? Well, it is. I was told by a friend that what matters is the film's journey. The film isn't going to win any awards for originality. ""Legend of the Red Dragon"" refers to the dragon tattoo at the back of an Asahina clan's master. The film does have the usual themes of betrayal, revenge, love and attempts for redemption. The film doesn't offer anything new, except that it does somehow manage to make me say ""What the Heck?"" once again. The film takes a dark and serious tone but the appearance of the ""Otomatsu trio"" just made me laugh my socks off. I was a little confused, as to this change of tone that gave the film a manga-inspired feel. Whether this was intentional or not, I rather took it as a way to lighten the film's mood a bit--even though it felt severely out of place.

Aside from the outrageous oddball trio, the film pretty much sticks to textbook Japanese action characters. Yui is an orphaned girl raised by a former hitman for the mafia played by legendary stunt coordinator Kenji Ohba (whose works are mostly followed by Tarantino himself). Yu Misaki who plays the female lead is a Japanese model who has represented Japan in different modeling competitions. I suppose her performance was decent enough as our beautiful, brooding heroine. There is nothing sexier than a beautiful Japanese woman in a red gown who wields a red katana sword. Kenichi Endo is the main antagonist and his role isn't any different from the other ones he has played. Some characters proved minor fillers to emphasize Yui's divided resolve. The film also relies on flashbacks (mostly shot in Black and white) to give our main characters some development.

The action sequences go from good to decent to mediocre to good. You can almost tell that the shooting of the action scenes required most of the film's budget and its quality shifts from time to time. I can definitely tell that some scenes required Yui as being doubled by a male stuntman but thankfully they abandoned this idea near its climax. Yu Misaki does her share of fight sequences but the camerawork didn't hang back to show all her moves. Despite its weaknesses, I thought Misaki looked capable in the action scenes and definitely exuded a restrained sexiness in the action poses. There are some blood splattering effects used and some gore had been utilized. I kind of liked the film's soundtrack, and of course there is some sex and nudity in its proceedings but they are quite mild compared to ""pink"" film standards.

Overall, ""Sekiryu No Onna"" is entertaining enough but definitely forgettable. It doesn't offer anything new to the genre but the Otomatsu trio is still making me crack up. The action scenes are quite mediocre compared to the awesome swordplay in Ryuhei Kitamura's fantastic ""Azumi"". I was real disappointed that the encounter between Yui and the Aramaki's Chinese female bodyguard didn't reach fruition but I guess it was hampered by the film's budget. The film's climax seemed a bit too perfunctory for my tastes and some elements were heavy-handed. The film wasn't bad but it was just too MEDIOCRE.
However, if you measure this film in regards to ""guilty pleasure"" with a 6-pack of brewsky---then yes, it would be quite good.

Recommended with caution to fans of Japanese cinema; Rental for everybody else. [2  Stars]
The dvd's quality is simple; the video is Letterboxed with 2.0 Dolby Digital Japanese track. The English Subtitles are good.",1225670400,3,4715,4.8207663782447465
1665687,1,B00005UM21,"This review is for the movie ""The Legend of Red Dragon"".

As the review by Christopher Beaumont ""draven993"" states, Amazon shows the artwork for ""The Legend of Red Dragon"", but has the product details for a different movie with a similar title. ""Legend of the Red Dragon"".

The artwork shown is for a movie starring Yu Misaki, and does not have Jet Li.

The product details are for a different movie that does not have Yu Misaki, but does have Jet Li.

The plot of The Legend of Red Dragon is simplistic, about a young girl who grows up to take vengeance on her father's killers. She uses a sword to kill. The subtitles are stupid, the type of dialog I remember from the 1970s Hong Kong chop socky movies. The acting is strictly amateur hour. And the action sequences are clumsy and unbelievable.

There are so many better movies out there to watch. Rent this turkey only if you plan to get drunk and watch this flic with some buddies for talking trash.",1223337600,2,953,4.454022988505747
1665695,1,B00005UM21,The image and description are for a 2006 Japanese film (Sekiry no onna) with the international title of THe Legend of the Red Dragon. This is not the Jet Li film from 1994 as indicated by the printed title and cast/director.,1221868800,2,224,4.487804878048781
1665696,4,B00005UM21,"The customer review currently featured first here urges us to buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Legend-of-Shaolin-DVD/dp/B000H0MKMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Legend of Shaolin DVD</a>, but many will actually prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-the-Red-Dragon-DVD/dp/B00005UM21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of the Red Dragon DVD</a>.  (For those not aware, these are different releases of the same movie, and the reviews are mixed together here.  The Shaolin release is from Tai Seng, a company with a mixed reputation for importing Hong Kong movies; the Red Dragon release is from Sony/Columbia Tristar.  What appears to be essentially the same Tai Seng DVD is also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B0000541U5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>.)

There are two main differences between the two versions.

1.  The Red Dragon version is edited so that it's 12 minutes shorter than the Tai Seng Shaolin version.  I don't think that necessarily makes it worse.  This isn't Citizen Kane, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  After the misleadingly grave beginning, this is mainly a low-budget, wacky martial-arts comedy, with over-the-top fights and characters, humorous throughout.  Judging from comparisons at Hong Kong movie websites, the cuts don't change anything of great importance.

And the 95-minute Tai Seng Shaolin release isn't really the fullest version anyway.  Amazon also lists&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-100-minute-version/dp/B000VZ1U1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a 100-minute version</a>.  I'd happily watch a longer version, but I didn't feel any great gaps that interfered with anything all that important in Legend of the Red Dragon, or find myself wishing it was longer.

2.  The other main difference is that Red Dragon offers the English dub only, while Shaolin offers Chinese with optional English subtitles only, with no option for an English dub.

As it happens, the English dubbing on the Red Dragon version is hilarious; it's hard to imagine that the original Chinese is any funnier, especially to those who don't speak Cantonese, or that the subtitles bring out some subtle humor missed in the dub.

So, if you're taking this movie the way it appears to be intended, that is, not so seriously, and you don't speak Chinese, you might prefer the Red Dragon version with the English dubbing.  It's currently very cheap used.

If you're not familiar with Jet Li, he's a great martial artist with a long career in Hong Kong and some American movies, capped by the recent Fearless (which is the kind of film that's better in its longer version).  If you like Jackie Chan's cheaper outings, or want to see some impressively choreographed martial arts action in a mainly comedic setting, try out whichever version of this movie and you'll have a good time.

Both versions are in non-anamorphic widescreen.  The image quality is good.

(""Red Dragon"" is a key place name in the move, by the way, so perhaps not entirely gratuitously chosen for the title.  Not that it really matters.  A final note: don't confuse this with the movie called simply Red Dragon--that's a completely different animal, and not half as much fun, in my view.)",1196294400,7,3373,5.977083333333334
1665697,4,B00005UM21,"Legend of the Red Dragon

This action film opens with Kwun (Jet Li) finding his village burned and his family burdered by the evil ""government"". Somehow his infant son survived the slaying, so Kwun makes the toddler choose between a sword and his favorite toy. If the boy Ting (Miu Tse) chooses the toy, Kwun will kill him. If he chooses the sword, the two will run off together, training and seeking vengeance along the way. Luckily, the boy waddles over to the shiny sword.

I have to tell you right now, this film made me giddy. I laughed, I oohed and ahhed over the fight scenes, I laughed some more, I just had a lot of fun watching it. Theres actually an okay storyline- a lot of stuff happens anyway. Granted its your typical plot: uphold honor, protect the weak, save the shaolin monks who are always being hunted by the evil emperor, etc. But when you add a little kid who could kick ANYONE'S ass into the mix with Jet Li and some really funny albeit lame bits, you have a wildly entertaining and highly watchable piece of Hong Kong cinema.

Some martial arts purists have issue with Li's manic wire use, but I think his stave techniques redeem him. Plus the wire stuff can be so cool when done right.

I thought the weakest point of the movie was the arch villain - he drove some kind of shiny ""flight of the navigator"" clown car, looked like a mutant x-man, and would just randomly appear. And his minions looked like ninja turtles at the end... odd.

It came out in 1994 and you can definitely see some pre-HERO and Crouching Tiger scenes. Red Dragon lacks their beauty and seriousness though. While HERO is epic and gorgeous, DRAGON is hilarious- even when its not trying to be. People who were a fan of Kung Fu Hustle and Hero will probably really enjoy this movie.

1665699,3,B00005UM21,"As a martial artist knowing your heritage is very important. As such I have been collecting every DVD about my Hung Gar predecessors I can get my hands on. Although finding movies about the legendary Wong Fei Hung is cakewalk finding films about the arguable founder of our style is much harder, at least so far. I bought this film because it's about Hung Tsi Kwan, and his son Man Ting. Although I enjoyed the story I do feel that it kind of dropped me into the middle of a story, rather than telling a self contained epic. The movie also missed some key historical points that would have been nice to have touched upon, i.e., the fact the Kwan was a tea merchant, his association and formation of the Red Lotus society (who trained on red boats in the sea to avoid detection by the Manchurian government). The conflict with Pai Mei (White Eyebrows), his being taught by Chi Zin (AKA Gee See Sum Si), and his eventual marriage to Fong Wing Chun (Not to be confused with Yum Wing Chun who started the Wing Chun style Bruce Lee studied before expanding on it to create Jeet Kuein Do).

 More tragic is the mockery of the ""kung fu sounds"" that is done by the English dub. We don't make noises like that. That was something Bruce Lee liked to do to show off, I guess... at any rate, while we do have our breathing techniques, they aren't as cheesy and annoying as what is portrayed by the English voice over.

 So while the English voice actors should familiarize themselves with real Kung Fu before doing such a project I must also reiterate that I found this fictional account of the life of Hung Tsi Kwan still amusing. The best part really was the kids.

 The kids in this movie were all very good for their age; I was quite impressed with how good their fight scenes were. This movie, however, won't likely entertain the general audiences. It's probably best to recommend this one exclusively to hard core Kung fu fans as the story is somewhat convulsed... Not Jet Li's finest moment, but a decent effort at least.",1112054400,2,2016,4.4646739130434785
1665700,4,B00005UM21,"Last night, after kung fu class, I watched Legend of the Red Dragon.  Chop socky is just the way to end a night of hard training!
The movie very loosely tells the tale of the Shaolin massacre, when almost all of the monks were murdered in an all-out attack.  The survivors consist of a hidden kung fu master and five child monks with map portions tattooed on their backs and the legacy of Shaolin in their minds.  Jet Li plays the ubiquitous Hung Hei-Kwun, hero of 90% of all kung fu flicks.
Legend of the Red Dragon is the sort of movie that fuels parodies.  It is filled with surreal ridiculous elements which make me pause the movie frequently so I can laugh hysterically.  From its piggyback baby battle to its miniature chrome Batmobile,  to the revelation that Jet Li is going commando, the film is filled with classic WTF moments.  I swear the bad guy in Legend of the Red Dragon is the English Patient.  Check him out, and you'll know exactly what I mean.
The movie is filled with sped-up wire fu, but this doesn't detract too much from some truly spectacular fight sequences using darts and collapsible staves.  Jet Li kicks some serious butt, and so does Miu Tse in his film debut; he's the little boy with a miniature Mohawk who plays Jet Li's son.  I'll be on the lookout for his subsequent movies!",1071014400,6,1310,4.466386554621849
1665701,5,B00005UM21,"As a relatively new martial arts film addict, I have to say that I loved this movie.  American martial arts films pale in comparison to Hong Kong originals such as this, and Legend of the Red Dragon proved to be a great little detour from the road of hand to hand kung fu action I have been following for some time now.  The main weapons of choice here are spears and darts, and the many fight scenes are simply incredible.  The laws of physics get swept right out of the window, but that's okay be me; only one or two moves here struck me as patently ridiculous, but even these were exciting and thrilling.  The dubbing was indeed rather bad, but I came to this movie for action, and that is what I got.
Jet Li stars as the warrior Hung Hei-Kwun, a loyalist to the Ming dynasty; as the movie opens, we see him return to his village to find everyone there slaughtered by the Manchus - everyone except his infant son Man Ting (Miu Tse).  Vowing revenge, Kwun lets his toddler (and fate) decide whether the boy lives to join his father's fight or joins his mother in death; the boy chooses wisely.  A betrayal of grand proportions soon finds Kwun surrounded by enemy fighters; many a martial arts hero has wiped out a troop of baddies all by himself, but Kwun does it with his infant son strapped to his back all the while.  When we next meet up with Kwun and his son seven years later, young Ting is the baddest little dude in town - a kung fu fighting machine, an incredibly disciplined young warrior, and a serious lad who probably has more self-control and wisdom than even his father.  Now penniless, Kwun agrees to serve as bodyguard to a wealthy merchant, and it is in his service that he gets to know Red Bean (Chingmy Yau), half of a mother-daughter con artist team currently plotting to rob Kwun's employer.  As all of this is going on, a master at the threatened Shaolin school is busy tattooing a map to the Shaolin treasure on the backs of five of his pupils in an effort to keep the treasure safe (although the fact the boys always seem to be together sort of defeats the purpose).  An old enemy of Kwun's, one whom he thought he had killed, wants that treasure, and he especially wants to kill Kwun.  This dude looks like he stuck his head in a pot of boiling water for about half an hour, but he is strong and invincible thanks to a witch's spell.  He also drives a metal super-car, something you just don't see everyday in films about the China of the distant past.  The Batmobile thing pushes the envelope way too far, but the movie is good enough to make up for the filmmaker's indiscretion.
Anyway, Kwun and Ting must fight to defeat the evil man from Kwun's past, protect the tattooed boys and in doing so save the Shaolin treasure, and deal with his feelings toward the lovely Red Bean.  For the most part, he just fights.  All of the action sequences in the film blew me away (but of course I'm not hard to impress when it comes to this type of action); you've got claws and darts being flung pell-mell out of nowhere, sword fights galore, and a little bit of kung fu thrown into the mix.  Li and his fellow performers are lightning quick in their movements, the main female characters are a force to reckon with, and young Ting is just a joy to watch.  Not only can he lick five boys his own age without breaking a sweat, he is basically an equal partner with his father, fighting right alongside him when the moment arises.  Their weapons are a little on the souped-up side, but, boy oh boy, it makes for some spectacular fight scenes.
The biggest mystery to me when it comes to Hong Kong films such as this is the comedy aspect.  As this movie progresses, an initially grim, sober tale is injected with increasing doses of comedy (only a small part of which can be attributed to the less than perfect dubbing).  Some of it is funny, but the movie suffers a little bit in the process.  Still, though, the amazing fight scenes alone make this a film that any martial arts fan should enjoy, and I might add in closing that the cinematography is also quite good, boasting one particularly beautiful scene midway through the film.",1067558400,2,4149,4.397385620915033
1665702,3,B00005UM21,"Before Jet Li became the mainstream Hollywood icon of LETHAL WEAPON fame, he was simply another of Hong Kong's chop socky martial arts stable of fighter actors.  Li was originally a Wu Shu champion of China who early in his life made his first action film.  His incredible athletic ability made him a fan favorite in both Beijing and Hong Kong.  For years, he made dozens of movies that were designed for the local Chinese market.  In THE LEGEND OF RED DRAGON, directors Jing Wing and Corey Yuen present Jet Li in another film that defies Western standards of criticism. In order for a Western audience to appreciate a movie like this one, they have to forget not only a non-Oriental sense of hammy-faced acting but the laws of physics as well.
The plot is merely a flimsy hook upon which to permit some truly incredible special effects that are so over the top that we can assume that they are by design rather than incompetence.  Jet Li and his infant son are the only survivors of a village that has been slaughtered by an evil regime that is looking for a treasure map that has been tattooed on the backs of five young boys.  This map is often referred to but figures in not at all during the working out of a paper thin plot.  Li has a romance with the daughter of a mother-daughter con team that seeks to marry rich men and then rob them. The five survivor boys team up with Li's son to battle not only the minions of the regime but also a reincarnated metal-man who incredibly has been magically rendered immortal.  Most of the action scenes defy the laws of physics and gravity, but I think that is the point of this genre of cinema.  For all the killing, there is remarkably little gore.  What you see is a sanitized version of a universe in which the inhabitants exist only to fly Tinker-Bell like with no one really getting hurt.  Once a Western viewer adopts the requisite mind set, then films like this one can be enjoyed on their own terms, which have more to do with the faded memories of his own childhood than with the rigidly defined constraints of current Hollywood filmmaking.",1062028800,4,2096,4.475065616797901
1665703,2,B00005UM21,"Don't always believe the great looking trailers before buying a movie. I was hoping for the action packed ""Jet Li versus the Manchu Army"" spectacle I was promised. Instead I got something totally different.
I have seen many Jet Li movies to include the great ""Once Upon A Time in China"" (OUATIC) series. I am usually not one to watch a movie in it's original form with the subtitles, but it MAY have helped Legend of the Red Dragon in this case. The dubbing was awful! The characters go...around...talking...like...this...for... most...of...the...movie. The dubbers were rediculous to try to match the dialouge with the the mouths EXACTLY as they spoke.
Would subtitles have helped? I'm not sure about that either. The dummies used for some of the stunts looked like stuffed pillows. There is an attempt to mix the comedy with the action, but it fails miserably. You laugh for all the wrong reasons. A burned skinned arch nemesis who rides in a silver plated go-cart! Please.
Do yourself a favor and rent this one. If you want great Jet Li films get the OUATIC series or ""Fist of Legend"". For a good mix of kung-fu and comedy try ""The Iron Monkey"" or ""The Prodigal Son"". You can thank me later.",1038787200,,1194,4.717703349282297

If so I think they either must have seen the wrong movie or been half asleep during it, because this it without a doubt one of his worst. The story is terrible, lacking originality, realism and even a true storyline. At times they try to much, to many sideslines, and at others (most) too little. The martial arts are even worse, lacking any reality. Not only that but it really looks bad. Matrix and many other movies present unrealistic martial art, but at least they have the excuse of looking good, or having some excuse in the story (Matrix is an unreal world to begin with), this has neither. To top it of the acting [stinks], as do the SFX, the subs make it worse (if that is possible). Dont buy this, its not worth it even IF your a JEt Li fan.

1665725,1,B00005UM21,"This is the second time I am trying to post a review of this film. Maybe they don't want you to know you are getting [a bad deal]?
Okay, so Columbia TriStar has done an excellent job presenting Hong Kong movies such as the Once Upon a Time in China series. They deserve praise for that, unlike the always despicable nimrods at Disney/Miramax/Dimension/Buena Vista.
Unfortunately, this time out Columbia TriStar has stumbled badly and decided to issue a truly sub-standard DVD, both compared to their own usual high standards and compared to what fans and viewers want.
This movie is actually a dubbed, edited, renamed version of the original movie titled ""New Legend of Shaolin"" which is actually also for sale by Amazon at about half the price of ""Legend of the Red Dragon""
The new title is mystifying: there are no dragons in this film, red or otherwise. The original title is much more appropriate: the story is about the semi-historical legend of 5 young monks who survived the destruction of the Shaolin Temple and went on to rebuild it. In this fictionalized account, Jet Li aids the 5 kids, and together they rebuild the legend of Shaolin Temple. Get it? Shaolin. Legend. New. Now is that so hard for American audiences to understand? Apparently, Columbia TriStar thinks so, hence the ridiculously random and generic reference to red
dragons or mauve phoenixes or teal lions or something like that.
And yes, this DVD has dubbed audio tracks only. Despite the ease with which multiple language tracks can be included on the same DVD disc, as Columbia TriStar themselves have done with other films, this time out they've chosen to give us literally less than half the value we expect. Why not include the original Cantonese audio track alongside the English dub? The only explanation I can think of is sheer laziness and disregard for the customer.
Is the dubbing of good quality? Who cares?! For [price] I expect BOTH audio tracks.
What is worse is that this dubbed version of the film is actually edited. That's right, footage has been cut from it. ""New Legend of Shaolin"" has a running time of 95 minutes. ""Myth of the Magenta Tapeworm"" is 87 minutes. That's 8 minutes or almost 1/10th of the movie, completely gone. Why? Apparently, because Columbia TriStar doesn't think enough of American audiences to give us the real stuff. Frankly, I am insulted.
Sorry, but for [price] this DVD includes less than half the entertainment value it should. A total [waste].
Do yourself a favor, go up to the area of the ""Product Details"" area which says ""Other Formats"" and click on the link that says ""DVD"". This takes you to the listing for ""New Legend of Shaolin"" the complete, unedited, original language, subtitled version of this film. And it will cost you almost [price]less.
For that price, the original ""New Legend of Shaolin"" is a value-packed DVD version of a zany, funny, action-packed, over the top martial arts classic starring the always excellent jet Li.",1027382400,53,2965,4.838582677165355
1665726,1,B00005UM21,"From a kung fu movie fan's standpoint, this is a poor movie. The actual fighting in it is all wire assisted, and the special effects are so primitive that it's laughable. There's a monster with a metal car, and these 5 shaolin monk kids that can't fight, and this woman named Red Bean who pretends her mother is dead so she can marry a rich guy. The very bad plot is impossible to follow. Watch this only if you're a jet li diehard, and if you have a free rental coupon.",1024272000,,470,4.175824175824176
1665727,4,B00005UM21,"Life is short and the time wasted watching bad movies leaves an especially dark hole in our time cards.  Here's a great action adventure that may be short on deep meaning but delivers high entertainment.
The charismatic Jet Li, several times Wu Shu world champion stars in ""LEGEND OF THE RED DRAGON"" a 1994 production just making its way to stateside DVD. Wu Shu, China's national sport, is largely a performance version of various combat art styles.
And this flick is a great display of Jet Li's skills.  Li started his training at the Beijing Wu Shu academy when he was nine, and soon won five gold medals, his first when he was only 11. In his teens, he was already a national coach, and before he was 20, he had starred in his first movie. His remarkable, acrobatic skills are on full display in this fast-paced, action-filled retelling of a Chinese revenge legend that may in fact have at its center a kernel of truth.
When his family and village are massacred by vicious, marauding Manchu soldiers, master warrior Kwun (Li) and his young son Ting are the only survivors.  They set out on a seven year odyssey in a quest of vengeance.  But along the way, Kwu and Ting encounter a rich mentor who has five young Shaolin masters under his charge who, unbeknownst to Kwu, have a detailed map to a great treasure tattooed on their backs.  Soon the Manchu soldiers hear of the map, and Kwu and Ting and the Shaolins must battle the very soldiers who desiccated the life force of his family and village.
A terrific story wonderfully realized with masterly choreographed, eye-popping fight scenes.  Subtitled with bonus photos and trailers.",1019088000,3,1638,4.689895470383275

What was done right in the film!
I relly enjoyed the atmosphere of this film. It was dark, but had alot of comedic relief. Jet Li does an awesome job fighting with his extendible spear.
The additon of a Kung Fu fighting son really helped open the plot into haveing some nice father son, and kid to kid seqeunces. Jet Li carries himself well in this film, and has a darker demeanor than he does in most of his films.
What was done wrong!
I [think] the villians little armored vehnicle...could have just as easily have been an armored suit or shield, and seemed more believable.
The dubbing was weak. Several of the voice actors had annoying voices, and made stupid jokes. The guy who dubs Jet Li was the exception. He does fairly well.
The dubbing is what really made me give this film only four stars. But if I had to go by Jet Li's spear fights, I'd give it a ten. You'll want to watch those secens again and again.",1014163200,,968,4.324175824175824
