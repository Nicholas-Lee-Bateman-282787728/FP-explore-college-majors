1640580,4,B00005O5J5,this is the most effective workout routine for me. I have tried many newer ones from other DVD. I still think this worked on the tummy the best.,1220745600,2,144,4.178571428571429
1640581,5,B00005O5J5,"This video changed my life as a teen and I am over the moon that I found it again and for such a cheap price.  It is the perfect full body, low impact workout.  The routines are deceptively simple, but when done properly and coupled with a sensible diet it can and has worked wonders. I wish Deborah Lee had continued making excercise tapes as I would buy every one.  I also wish it was available on DVD.",1216166400,2,404,4.153846153846154
1640582,5,B00005O5J5,"I found this video over 15 years ago in a discount bin at Caldor. I used it in college and loved the results. Over the years it has been my 'go to' workout when dieting (before wedding, after having babies,10 year anniversary) It has a nice pace and you can feel the result. It is dated though (It is at least 20 years old) - music, clothing, hairstyles- don't let that be a deterrent, it works. I have looked high and low over the years to replace my worn out copy and could never find one. I have recently moved and believe my old copy was accidentally thrown out. Thank you, Amazon, for putting a replacement in my hands!",1208304000,2,624,4.2521008403361344
1640583,5,B00005O5J5,I love this workout. It is challenging in the fact that she really works your arms in the 1st aerboic segment. But it is do-able and I've noticed an improvement in my body after 2 months of 3x a week. I wonder what Deborah Lee is doing now?,1119312000,6,240,4.020833333333333
1640584,5,B00005O5J5,"I orignally bought this aerobic video in 1990.  I used it so much that it literally wore out. I searched everywhere for this video but could not find it.  Needless to say I was thrilled when I found it through Amazon. I have tried other aerobic videos over the years but always preferred this one. It gives you a good workout of your arms, legs, abdomen, etc.  The reason I like it the fact that it does not have any jumping or leg plunges.",1021593600,17,440,4.214285714285714
1640585,5,B00005O5J5,"I bought it because of the cheep price. It is a very low impact workout, which is fine because I am 60 years old and just starting to workout after several years not doing so. It has a 70s look, made in the 80s. This is an easy workout that I had no trouble with finishing the entire workout the first time. A very good starter video.",1331424000,,334,4.0
1640586,5,B00005O5J5,I used this video in the 90s until I finally wore it out. It was the best exercise video for a full body short workout. I have missed it for years. Just finally got on amazon and am so glad I found it. Just perfect for a 29 minute workout. Yeah!!!!,1331337600,2,248,3.8823529411764706
1640587,5,B00005O5J5,"I used this 25 years ago and wore out the tape.  I'm so glad someone had a copy.  If you want low impact but see results this is the tape for you.  You won't hurt after, it's quick and works the entire body.",1308182400,2,207,3.7674418604651163
1640588,5,B00005O5J5,"This is a very old video, it will give you on the the best workouts of your life. it is really good for toning your upper body.  You will see and feel the result the next day and it is so easy to follow.
SIMPLY THE BEST, PERIOD.",1300060800,2,228,3.75
1640589,5,B00005O5J5,"This time effective workout is great for variety! Very fun effective moves, some I have not seen in other workouts!",1277078400,,115,4.8
1640590,5,B00005O5J5,"I have used this workout tape for years and I love it. It targets about everthing. warm-ups, cardio, calistinics, all muscle groups, cooldown. It is easy to follow without getting lost or behind. My original tape stopped working,then so did my workouts, I was estatic when I found it for sale on the internet.tape works great. wish they made it on DVD.",1275091200,4,352,4.693548387096774
1640591,4,B00005O5J5,"Although old, this work out is one of the best I've ever used. It tones your entire body. I've had back surgery and can't do many of the work outs available. This is great to start at your own pace and as you go along you'll notice  you're stepping up the pace and having fun working out! Easy to follow steps so you're not tripping over yourself in the beginning.",1253232000,4,364,4.2
1640592,4,B00005O5J5,"I had this tape way back in the day and it was one of the only workout videos I could do the whole way thru.  I loved that video and I lost mine.  Thanks to Amazon I have found an oldie but a goodie.

Thanks alot.",1242432000,2,213,3.5869565217391304
1640593,5,B00005O5J5,This tape is great for those who are beginning an exercise workout or who have been away from working out for awhile and are starting back in.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow. There is no confusion about what is coming up next.  The positions are not complicated and the cardiovasular workout is great for your heart. It's 29 minutes of solid workout from beginning to end with a warm up and a cool down that is perfect. Deborah Lee is one of my favourite instructors because of her clarity and easy to follow moves.  I highly recommend this tape.,1241481600,3,562,4.490196078431373
1640594,5,B00005O5J5,"I have had this workout since it first came on the market.  The 80's I think.  I still do this today.  It is a great workout every time.  The clothes they are wearing are a little dated.  I struggle every time to get through the arm workout, wow it kills me.  My sister who is a tri-athelte loves the video.  This is labeled for beginners and beginners can do most of it but it's good once you are advanced too.",1237507200,2,411,4.0625
7948403,5,B00005O5J5,"Best workout video ever. She's super motivational and positive and has a very sweet voice. It's not like that P90X stuff for people trying to beast out. It's easy and fun even for people with physical disabilities. Love the cotton candy pink leotard she wears. It reminds me of Lisa Frank drawings. It's not the same woman as on the cover of the video. The only thing that would be better is if I could get this on dvd or Blu-ray. It's hard to play video cassettes now, even so my kids and I do this workout together and it's awesome.",1522972800,,534,4.297029702970297

7948407,5,B00005O5J5,been looking to replace lost workout video for years.  Good low impact workout for beginners or older people who like to work out.,1398902400,,130,4.6521739130434785
7948408,3,B00005O5J5,"this came fast, bought it for the daughter, and she said it is not really clear all the way through.  They need to update this particular workout to DVD !!!",1395705600,,156,4.2
7948409,5,B00005O5J5,"BEFORE I TRIED  JANE FONDA, KATHY SMITH, TAMILEE WEBB, JOYCE VEDRAL,THE FIRM, LESLIE SANSONE, VARIOUS BELLY DANCE PROGRAMS, AND A FEW OTHER FITNESS PROGRAMS, THIS WAS THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL. I HAD JUST GOTTEN A COLOR TV AND VCR AND THIS WAS MY FIRST EXERCISE VIDEO PROGRAM. I USED IT EVERYDAY FOR A WHILE UNTIL I BEGAN TRYING SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT I LISTED ON THIS REVIEW. OH, I LOVED IT. I DIDN'T FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND I WISH IT WAS RELEASED ON DVD NOW. I WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST NAME OF THE INSTRUCTOR BECAUSE I WAS/AM INTERESTED IN BUYING THIS PROGRAM AGAIN. SO I STARTED ASKING ON THE INTERNET UNTIL I CAME UPON AN ARTICLE THAT TRIGGERED MY MEMORY. I'M GLAD IT LED ME HERE SO THAT I COULD WRITE THIS REVIEW. EVEN THOUGH I COULD BUY ANOTHER COPY OF THIS ON VHS I NO LONGER HAVE MY VCR. THIS PROGRAM IS PERFECT IN TIME, NOT TO LONG, NOT TO SHORT, JUST RIGHT. I HAVE USED A LOT OF EXERCISE PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS. SOME OF THEM I WOULD BUY AGAIN, MOST OF THEM, I WOULDN'T. SPEAKING OF BUYING AGAIN, I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT I FIRST PAID FOR THIS TITLE, BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS BETWEEN $10-$15.00. I SURE HOPE THIS TITLE IS TRANSFERRED TO DVD SOON.",1390003200,2,1167,4.1866666666666665
7948410,5,B00005O5J5,My mother is 67 and loves this exercise tape! It is easy to follow and she does get results. she only has a VCR so we were delighted to find it VHS,1378425600,,147,3.625
7948411,5,B00005O5J5,My story is the same - I bought this tape years ago - I think in the 80's and used to do it all the time.  Just found it and have been doing it again - my body toally remembers the moves!  I think it is a great light workout when you don't have time to get to the gym.  I have been ill and find that the tempo really is helping me get active again.,1350432000,,348,3.5526315789473686
7948412,5,B00005O5J5,"I first started doing this workout when this video first came out in the 1980's.  I wore the tape out.  I bought another one, then lost it.  I just got one off of ebay.  I also wish Deborah Lee would have put out more of these kinds of workouts.  I am able to do it.  Some other workouts I've tried are just too hard, but this one is doable.  I found a long time ago that I felt better when I did this everyday.  So now in my 50's, I'm going to start doing it again.  I used to be able to do it without even breaking a sweat.  I need to get to that point again.  I love this video!",1341446400,,581,3.71900826446281
