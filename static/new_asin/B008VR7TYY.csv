8531219,5,B008VR7TYY,"Those who remember the Golden Age of the TV talk show, fondly remember producer David Susskind, who for nearly 30 years interviewed celebrities - whether entertainment or political - on his weekly show. It began on local New York City television in 1958 on the independent TV station WNTA. (The same station that aired his ""Play of the Week Series"") When WNTA became a public broadcasting station, the show - ""Open End"" went into syndication. It also changed its name sometimes to ""The David Susskind Show""

Unlike the Dick Cavett Show - which I have devoured on DVD - Susskind was more serious in interviewing a guest during his one- hour or two-hour show (less commercials). I'd compare him more with Charlie Rose - but with a decidedly New York accent. And he could be sarcastic.

To my knowledge none of the ""Open End"" shows has been available on home video until last year when S'more Entertainment began releasing them (a two-hour Jerry Lewis interview was the first).

This  55-minute DVD has comedian Milton Berle as his only guest. Berle was making the talk show circuit in 1974 promoting his just published autobiography (titled ""Milton Berle: An Autobiography"") and that is the source of much of the discussion. We learn how poor Berle and his family were growing up in New York. (""We ate rice every day; the SAME rice!"") and this poverty is the fucus of the conversation for nearly the first 16 minutes. Though I quote one ""joke"" above, there are very few funny in this show. This is the most serious I have seen Berle in front of a live audience. Berle entered show business at about age seven and was a huge success in vaudeville and on the New York stage and that is where the rest of the show is focused. WE learn virtually nothing about his life after age 33. (He was 66 years old at time of interview.). Susskind, who can often overpower his interviewee does a wonderful job here of drawing the stories - nearly all new to me (I haven't read the book) - from Berle.  There is one moment, about  into the interview where Berle's revelation will put a lump in your throat.

So, if you are looking for a ""fun"" time, this is not the DVD for you. But those who remember Berle from his Texaco Star Theatre or have an interest in show business in the days of vaudeville will certainly want to see this.

The color print is good, with a few videotape ""dropouts"" , though that really doesn't affect watching it.

I hope that S'more Entertainment will continue to release these Susskind shows, many of which (like this one from New York's WNEW-TV) were only shown in New York area.
