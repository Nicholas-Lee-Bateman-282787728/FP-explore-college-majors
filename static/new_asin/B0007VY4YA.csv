8052473,2,B0007VY4YA,"The people responsible for marketing this video came up with what I thought to be an incredibly hot DVD box-cover pic showing an attractive nude young woman surrounded by mostly full-clothed women with their hands fondling & caressing the nude girl's lovely body.  Sadly, the bland soap-opera story inside didn't come anywhere near to living up to that highly-erotic cover, which promised so much more!  Yes, there are a few scenes showing women making out, but don't expect quality-lesbian-erotica here because you won't find it.",1415750400,,530,5.223529411764706
8052474,1,B0007VY4YA,The description of this movie does not match the one on the DVD box.  It sounds like an entirely different movie!,1415577600,,113,4.380952380952381
8052475,1,B0007VY4YA,"This is not the 1932 film with Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, and Ann Dvorak.  I didn't bother to watch this version but the cover is pretty lame and I don't really see anybody actually wanting this.",1117584000,10,196,4.444444444444445
