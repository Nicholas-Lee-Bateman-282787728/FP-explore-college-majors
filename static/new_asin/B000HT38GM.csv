8141068,3,B000HT38GM,"This DVD contains no Pink Floyd music, just interviews with the band members.

The content is moderately interesting, but there are a lot of tour-related interviews where interviewers from Europe and the US tend to ask the same questions and get the same answers. For example, asking Nick Mason what he is enjoying playing on the tour and him telling two different interviewers that it's fun to be playing Astonomy Domine after all these years. Or Roger Waters saying on two different occasions that whatever happens in the band's breakup (still ongoing at the time), it will be ""graceful"". There are other similar cases of dja vu.

Roger Waters more than equal coverage, mostly from the post-Floyd period. Some questions about the music, the breakup, the future. Nothing really surprising, but interesting anyway.

Most of the videos honestly look like they were transferred to DVD from somebody's home VCR tapes. You can see and hear acceptably, and since this isn't music this is no big problem, but still the quality seems amateurish.

The interviews are scattered all over the place in terms of timing -- mostly from the 1990s and 1980s, a little from 2000 (you can tell because Waters references George W. Bush as president), and a short clip of Syd Barrett from the 1960s. Maybe just one or two short bits from the 1970s related to ""The Wall"". It is a weakness that there is no indication on the interviews as to when or where they were prepared.

All in all this is worth a view for Pink Floyd fans, but they will find no great revelations. Three stars for them -- but unless you already take a special interest in Pink Floyd, there is no point whatsoever in watching this.",1255305600,3,1681,4.723549488054608

8141070,3,B000HT38GM,"Its alright. Does what it says on the tin: Pink Floyd interviews

Starts with interviews of the Pink Floyd on the Earls Court disaster of 1994. Nice to have the late Rick Wright talked to here - he just wants to play keyboards man! A lot of footage of him and the other 2 from UK tv

Not too much Syd. A brief snippet of him being interviewed on BBC in B&W by Hans. Theres not much Barrett on video, being interviewed, so be thankful for what you got

Quite a bit on Roger, who is an intriguing interview. He doesn't give much away, really doesn't like interviews. Theres some color interview on Radio KAOS, some bad quality B&W off French tv. Its pretty engrossing despites itself (Roger comes across as pretty interesting, but theres some stuff he doesn't want to talk about - or just plain can't (when asked to sum up Radio KAOS, he says its impossible. That albums impossible to understand

Gilmour talks about the 1994 Division Bell tour, and on the longevity of the band despite not being a singles band. He expands on his relationship with his lyricist/wife

Is it worth watching? Yeah, I guess. But I can't imagine it being watched again and again. I took it out from the library, and am glad I didn't have to pay for it

Try to find the Roger Waters Video Anthology dvd, which has a lot of the KAOS interview (Roger with shades.. giving NOTHING away!!)

Presentationwise, the dvd IS a shambles - no info on the years stuff is from; the fan will recognize the Syd interview snippet from 1967 (Look of the Week)

But it would help if you had some idea where some stuff is from

Worth watching for the Waters footage I deem, which is rather a lot. But its complete on the RW Video Anthology dvd

And its good to see Rick Wright footage. He talks about being sacked after the Wall, but he really looks happy to be with the band again, and doing keyboards live. RIP Rick",1226448000,6,1874,4.359195402298851
8141071,3,B000HT38GM,"""Pink Floyd: Shine On"" has strengths and weaknesses as an interview DVD. While focusing on material from after ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final-Cut/dp/B000002C1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final Cut</a>,"" interviews span back to the Syd Barrett days. Fortunately, Roger Waters is well represented. Considering that most interviews were pulled off European news reports, they are surprisingly lengthy and in-depth. The audio and video quality greatly varies from excellent to awful, but most clips are very watchable. The hiss should have been reduced in the roughest segments. Highlights include material on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wall/dp/B000006TRV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wall</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Division-Bell/dp/B000002A3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Division Bell</a>&nbsp;backstage footage and Waters'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Radio-K-A-O-S/dp/B0000026BN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Radio K.A.O.S.</a>&nbsp;studio interview. A serious drawback to the experience is the lack of introductions. While watching, there are no transitions that introduce the next interview with dates, locations or other relevant information. The menu only identifies sections as 'chapter 1,' 'chapter 2,' etc. In this respect, ""Shine On"" feels like a fan made product. While much of the interviews feature predictable content, most fans will learn some revelation or fascinating tidbit that they didn't previously appreciate. ""Pink Floyd: Shine On"" has many production issues, but it is worth a watch for the die-hard Floydians.",1185840000,14,1737,8.005181347150259
