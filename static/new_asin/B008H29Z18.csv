5161494,3,B008H29Z18,"Here's another example of excellent music undermined by idiotic direction.

First the kudos:

Juan Diego Florez dashes off the stratospheric part of the Trojan hero, Ilo, with his usual aplomb:  the coloratura brilliant, the acuti accurate and the acting intelligent.  And, I'll say the same of Kate Aldrich in the title role and of Marianna Pizzolata as her confidant, Emma.  Ms. Aldrich is one of the finest singing actresses I've seen in a long time.  Her voice is beautiful and even through the registers, the coloratura is dazzling and her emotional involvement intense.  Despite my reservations about the production, the DVD is worth hearing simply for her performance.  Ms Pizzolata is good throughout the opera, particularly in the first act duet (Perche mi guardi e piangi  -- the loveliest number in the opera, soprano and mezzo accompanied by harp and cor anglais) -- and in her second act preghiera.  Gregrory Kunde sings well and appears to relish playing the villain of the piece.  I found Alex Esposito as Zelmira's father, Polidoro, the weakest link.  The voice had so little presence I couldn't really form a good opinion of it.  Perhaps that was due to the uncongenial surroundings of performing in a converted sports arena, although there was a mike prominently stuck on the side of his head.  Maybe the mike wasn't adjusted correctly.

The orchestra and chorus of the Teatro Comunale of Bologna performed admirably under the direction of Roberto Abbado.  The performance used the critical edition was that prepared by the Rossini Foundation and published by Casa Ricordi.

The DVD transfer presents a crisp picture.  The sound was a bit over reverberant on my sound equipment and I had to adjust the bass accordingly.

Now for the complaints:

I watched the performance through in a single sitting and could make absolutely nothing of the dramatic action.  There was simply far too much action and far too little drama.  The first act was well along before I finally realized that most of the almost incessant movement I was seeing was occurring under the stage.  That's right, under the stage.  The singers walk on a steel grill, under which there's almost constant motion, reflected in a huge mirror over the stage.  This is very distracting, especially in the first act duet for Zelmira and Ilo.  The mirrored surface isn't stable, so when it's lowered to reflect the orchestra (as happens at least once during the dramatic action), the billowing effect can induce mild nausea.

In the special feature, the director explains that this mirror is meant to convey that all the action takes  place in a dream.  Yeah, right.  I call it another pompous director presenting Regietheater.  He also explains his view of the character of Zelmira being the great ""nourisher"".  This, he says, is his excuse for the scene in the first act that I thought was just plain nasty.  Zelmira visits her father in his hiding place amongst the crypts.  The dialogue indicates that she has brought him food.  Instead, she opens her bodice and breast-feeds her father.  I have no problem with seeing a woman breast feeding her infant; there's nothing more natural.  But, a woman breast feeding her father is not natural, and it's, well, nasty.

I've knocked off a star for the annoyance of the distracting motion and another for the nastiness.

I'm sure that I'll listen to this DVD again, but I doubt that I'll ever watch it a second time.  I recommend it for the music and deplore it for the pretentious production.",1348963200,50,3516,4.903225806451613
5161495,5,B008H29Z18,"When Zelmira premiered in Naples on 16 February 1822, Rossini had three of the best singers in Italy to sing the lead roles: Isabella Colbran, Giovanni David and Andrea Nozzari. I doubt that even that legendary trio brought off the vocal excellence of this performance. While the plot has been termed ""tedious and dully written"" and ""absurd and complicated"" by Charles Osborne in ""The Bel Canto Operas"", as far as operas go, it isn't all that bad. Staging and camera work prove a major distraction through much of it, but to me, the sheer splendor of the vocalism trumps the troublesome staging, much as was the case with Mary Zimmerman's notorious approach to La Sonnambula at the Met.

So let me start with the singers:

Juan Diego Florez (JDF to fans) is, for me, a near force of nature. He is, I believe, the finest tenor interpreter of Rossini in the last 150 years, and one (but not the only) reason for the rebirth of interest in Rossini's opera seria. Simply put, he sings the roles that other tenors can't, since the extended range and coloratura demands are just beyond them. We have and enjoy every one of JDF's CDs and DVDs, but as we watched this disc for the first time last night, my wife and I paused and replayed several numbers, amazed at the vocal athleticism displayed. Zelmira's tenor role (Ilo) is the most vocally complex in all of Rossini, and I simply cannot imagine even the legendary Giovanni David doing as good a job as JDF does. Bravo!!

Kate Aldrich was similarly riviting; Colbran and Rossini had to be beaming in the that big opera house in the sky. I heard (and saw) her as Amneris in a TDK DVD of Aida filmed in the tiny (10 m stage)Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto. But that was Verdi and this is a far different kind of opera. There have been several descriptions on Isabella Colbran's singing, emphasizing the creamy voice, extended range, agility and stage presence. Aldrich excelled in all aspects of this demanding role, leading me to beg the opera gods (and the DVD manufacturers, if they read this stuff) to stage her as Rosina and Cenerentola for openers. Soonest! Brava!!

Gregory Kunde has been singing for quite some time, and his voice has lost some of the  focused intensity of his younger years. Nonetheless, he does an excellent job as the ""bad guy"", Antenore. He has a lot of stage presence and can ""leer and sneer"" in fine villainous style. The role, like those for all singers here, requires the agility to navigate the fiendish colorature which Rossini wrote. The same high quality of sheer vocal skills and agility are displayed by the rest of the cast. Simply amazing!!

Which brings me to the staging: I just don't get it. The opera is produced in a sports arena converted quite nicely to a theatre. But the stage director, in the main, eschewed scenery for a mirrored backdrop, which I found to be a huge distraction, since it visually distorted what was going on with the cast. It also reflected the ""front"" of the orchestra with similar effect. And the camera crew's need to switch between the main action and the reflection just intensified the negative effect. While the opera is staged in modern dress (and weaponry) that does not diminish the essence of the piece; the mirror effect does!

Having said that, gentle reader, the 5 star review reflects my assessment of the totality of this disc in which Rossini composed some amazingly beautiful music, which is, in turn, performed with the highest degree of excellence. Roberto Abbado does a polished, masterful interpretation of the score, supporting, but never rushing or retarding the singers. And despite my present reservations about the staging, the dramatic intensity which each singer brings to his/her part could not be done justice by reducing the opera to a CD audio only version. It needs to be seen as well as heard.

There is an extended ""behind the scenes"" extra on side 2, which I plan to view again to see if I can understand what the stage director was trying to do. There are subtitles; the picture was Decca's usual highy quality and the sound, especially as to the chorus, sounded a bit compressed. Microphones were visible on some singers but did not distract. As an edit, I was just asked by e mail whether the Amazon timing was correct on its data section at 60 minutes. It is not. The opera lasts about3 hours and 20 minutes and the bonus section on side 2 is 20 minutes.

If Bel Canto, Rossini and great singing are what you enjoy, I suspect you will find this performance as enjoyable as we did. And maybe you can comment, if you ""get"" the staging?",1347408000,28,4589,4.655555555555556
5161496,5,B008H29Z18,"I hadnt heard this opera before and knowing it was the last one written by Rossini I was interested in hearing it because I was familiar with him as a very good composer mainly in comedy. When I read the reviewers I noticed that this a was a dramatic story and I decided to buy this DVD, besides I knew that it has a very strong cast .I knew Kate Aldrich, Juan Diego Flores and Gregory Kunde from other performances .I wasn't familiar with the rest of the cast but when I saw the opera I realized why they were selected for this demanding and complicated opera.
The singing and acting were outstanding, any one can enjoy listening to a single area, for instance the perfect singing of one of the best of Rossinis interpreters in the world now a days is Juan Diego Flores .The same can be said of any of the duets, trios, chorus sung by the cast and chorus.
I found the scenery very interesting using a mirror to reflect a sequencing of actions that were occurring at the same time that the main plot such as horrors of the war like wounded worriers, women, children, prisoners and some images about experiences that some of the main characters had; some symbolisms were used as well.
Without any doubt I consider this an outstanding production.",1379203200,4,1244,4.4605263157894735
5161497,5,B008H29Z18,"Florez's voice is unbelievable -- astounding agility and beauty of tone.  He brings down the house with his opening aria, sort of like Ramey did at the Scala with Atilla's opening aria.  All of the principals are good.  The lady who sings Emma makes one glad that Rossini added to that part following the prima.  The title role was done amazingly well.  I'm sure that the imaginative production was effective in the opera house, but it just looks dark and confused on DVD.  However, the nude Greek statues twirling in the air do make their effect!",1376092800,,547,4.645833333333333
5161498,4,B008H29Z18,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine, the start menu let's you chose the sound track and the subtitles.

Sound is DTS-HD MA 5.1. Sound stage for the orchestra is not that wide, about 2 feet beyond the front corner speakers. The orchestra microphones seem to pick up a lot of noise in the pit, which is sometimes a bit distracting. This is a recording with body microphones, so the voices are clear but come only through the center speaker. Balance with the orchestra is good. Chorus a bit further in the background. Applause from the front and sides could be a bit louder. Overall, it gives the impression of sitting in row 10. It is somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star recording audiowise, but I'll give it a 4 for Gregory Kunde and Juan Diego Florez.

As far as the direction and the modern scenery/costumes are concerned, I am willing to overlook a lot of folly if the sound is acceptable and that is the case here. You get Juan Diego Florez along with Gregory Kunde, who's first aria gets already plenty of bravos and the Italian audience is not known for giving bravos for nothing. I like his bright voice and you can sample it on youtube. He also does an outstanding job in Les Troyens with ""Nuit d' ivresse"".

The other principals including Kate Aldrich are not far behind. I believe you will have to wait for a long time before something better is available, as this opera is rarely performed, the difficult vocal requirements being one of the reasons.",1375920000,7,1878,4.514705882352941
5161499,3,B008H29Z18,The singing is excellent and the orchestra is wonderful. The production is horrible. Distracting stage activity. Another director who will not focus on the singers. I will listen to this again but I will not watch it. The production is the reason why I gave the performance this rating.,1366934400,7,286,4.857142857142857
5161500,5,B008H29Z18,"""Non  Rossini questo.""  (Rossini is not this.) So declares mezzo-soprano Marianna Pizzolato in an interview during the bonus section of this DVD, and ironically I had the exact same thoughts when viewing this extraordinary performance of this amazing opera.  Well, it is indeed Rossini as only Rossini could have written this epic-sized and brilliant work.  However, it is Rossini with many astonishing and unexpected detours from what we normally consider to be the Rossini style. Perhaps the reason for so many of the deviations concerned the fact that the opera was to be presented in Vienna after its initial run in Naples.  Incidentally, Rossini added an extra scene for that Viennese premiere and later even altered the final scene when he presented the work in Paris.  It is the opera in its final Parisian form (which includes both of these alterations) that is offered in this performance.

Since the performance comes to us courtesy of the Rossini Opera Festival (usually referred to as ""il ROF"" in Italy) it goes without saying that the musical aspects will be of the highest standards attainable.  It also goes without saying the staging will be controversial, notorious, and contentious!  Such is the history of il ROF.  In any event the opera is given as a dream sequence with mirrors reflecting the actions on stage and even some of the actions underneath the stage as well.  It is all confusing and districting, but it seems that all the artists were as one with the concept so it all somehow works... somehow... even though the most successful portions of the staging occur when the action is presented in a relatively straightforward manner.  In any event, I would suggest viewing the aforementioned bonus section prior to viewing the opera proper where the stage director and conductor discuss the concept.  It will help make some sense out of this perplexing and chaotic conception of the piece.

At any rate, with any Rossini opera it is the singing that matters most and here il ROF not only hits the ball out of the park... but hits a grand slam as well!  The absolute star is Kate Aldrich in the title role... her smooth yet dramatic vocal production is perfect for the part... a part written for Rossini's favorite diva Isabella Colbran.  Next it must be noted that Juan Diego Florz as Ilo is his usual reliable self... his sweet tones perfectly encompassing the high lying vocal range required in a role written for Giovanni David.  However, the real tenor star is Gregory Kunde as Antenore, whose ""baritone"" vocal sound probably is a reasonable facsimile of the type of voice that the original Antenore Andrea Nozzari possessed. Incidentally, while Florz is featured on the box cover... it is Kunde who actually has the meatier and larger of the two major tenor assignments.  The remainder of the cast is also outstanding with the above mentioned Marianna Pizzoloto an excellent Emma and Alex Esposito a very fine Polidoro.  Incidentally, the entire cast not only sings well, but also manages to create believable characters in the process... and that goes for the comprimarios as well.  That fact alone makes the bewildering stage concept somewhat plausible and believable.  Roberto Abbado is the experienced conductor who not only keeps the ensemble completely and perfectly together in one of the most complicated scores that Rossini ever penned, but conducts in a manner which brings out the excitement and drama of the piece.  Indeed, he not only is effective in the overtly pompous sections of the score, but also lovingly interprets the many smaller sections of the composition... such as the many entirely string based interludes... not to mention the extraordinary duet for Zelmira and Emma which is accompanied only by harp and cor anglais.

Sound and picture quality as viewed in the DVD version are excellent. Get this in spite of the bizarre staging... It contains some of the most glorious singing ever preserved in sound.",1357948800,6,3963,4.971212121212122
5161501,3,B008H29Z18,"Rossini's final opera written for Naples, Zelmira, is rather less well-known now than the greater works written for Paris that immediately follow it - Mose et Pharaon, Le Comte Ory, Guillaume Tell.  It's an opera that places exceptional demands on the singers, but perhaps no more so than those later works, so that only accounts for part of the reason why it so rarely performed.  Produced for the Rossini Opera Festival in 2009, the problems with staging Zelmira would seem to derive from the nature of the work itself as an opera seria.  It's a long work that follows the format of set scenes and emotions that presents challenges that even the musical invention of Rossini or strong singing performances alone can't overcome.  It needs to work dramatically, and unfortunately, Giorgio Barberio Corsetti's messy and confused production for Pesaro doesn't do much to help it.

Although there are claims by Roberto Abbado and the Pesaro Festival organisers that Rossini's music here extends the constraints of opera seria, the structure remains largely intact, and Rossini in reality does little more than play around to bring bel canto ornamentation and colour to the aria da capo.  There are some terrific arias and arrangements here in Zelmira, but there is nothing that Rossini hasn't already taken much further and with better dramatic integrity in earlier work for Naples like La Donna del Lago.  The music for Zelmira for the most part - in between the showpiece arias - remains fairly rigid and lacking in variation, building from a canter to a gallop in that famous Rossinian style to create a rising emotional intensity, but its peaks are ill-served and ill-matched to an unexciting plot that is weighed down by the unwieldy conventions of the opera seria form.  The plot of Zelmira is frankly mechanical and improbable, relying on standard situations, coincidences and actions that arise from rather one-dimensional character development.

Ostensibly then Zelmira is very much in the tradition of the opera seria, dealing with rulers, power, corruption and lies, but in reality, as the title of the opera derived from the name of the heroine suggests, it's more about the heroine, Zelmira.  Faced with injustice, false accusations, her innocence and integrity called unjustly into question, Zelmira is very much the early prototype for the bel canto heroines of Donizetti and Bellini.  If Kate Aldrich isn't quite able to make her Zelmira work, it's through no fault of her singing which has real power and expressiveness, but rather more of a question of this being a role that requires a singer of greater stature and personality to bring it to life and make her predicament credible and sympathetic.

The same challenge faces all the singers here, but in their case, they really need better stage direction and a better production design than the one provided here.  Juan Diego Flrez has plenty of personality and the range to meet the demands of this kind of Rossinian role - strong, resonant, wonderfully musical and expressive, but his high timbre is never the most pleasant and it's not helped by the acoustics of the stage (set up in Pesaro's Adriatic basketball arena) sounding quite piercing at the high notes in a way that is hard on the ears.  The sound suits the bass and bass-baritone voices much better, giving a lovely resonance to Alex Esposito's grave Polidoro and Mirco Palazzi's Leucippo, whose recitative even sounds richly musical.  Gregory Kunde however also comes across well as Antenore, and Marianna Pizzolato almost steals the show with her luxurious mezzo-soprano in the contralto role of Emma.

With a cast this good, a stronger production might have made all the difference, but Giorgio Barberio Corsetti's concept doesn't seem to suit the character of the work.  Instead of Zelmira's predicament, the focus is very much upon the nature of war and power, the director setting the production in near darkness, using overhead mirrors to reflect the darker and hidden side of all these power struggles and lies that we don't normally see, reflecting wounded, tortured and dead troops placed beneath the grilled stage.  Apart from not really helping the opera where it needs the support, it actually works against it, making it seem very messy, unfocussed and often downright ugly.

It may have looked better in the theatre, but the darkness of the stage, the figures highlighted in pale yellow light, with confusing reflections in the background mirrors, doesn't come across well on the screen, even in High Definition.  There appears to be some post-production adjustments to balance the contrasts, and even shadowing applied to block out the frequently visible conductor Roberto Abbado at the front of the stage, but this only proves to be even more distracting and messy.  The PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks on the Blu-ray disc however are mostly fine, even if there is some harshness in the reverb of the acoustics.  The Decca BD also includes a 25-minute Making Of, which contains interesting thoughts and information on the work itself and the production from the cast and the production team.",1355529600,7,5153,5.0590318772136955
5161502,4,B008H29Z18,"Bel canto singing is alive and well and in the contents of this magnificent recording. As expected, Juan Diego Florez delivers one of the best performances ever of some of the most difficult music in the bel canto canon. He is an absolute joy to listen to and his vocal pyrotechnics are nothing short of amazing. In addition, the other members of the cast are also masters of this style of singing. Kate Aldrich as the beleaguered daughter and wife Zelmira delivers grand fioritura even under the most taxing of circumstances. The mezzo of Marianna Pizzoloto as Emma, Zelmira's confidant, is also excellent. Her rendering of ""Ciel pietoso, ciel clemente"" is one of the high points of the performance. Gregory Kunde as the evil ursurper Antenore started off weakly but improved in later scenes. The rest of the cast were of high standard and accomplishment.
This opera (1822)is the last of the Naples series that had occupied Rossini since arriving at the San Carlo at the behest of the manager Barbaja in 1815. He has blossomed and matured as an opera composer in this environment having written by now a total of some thirty scores. Many of these were not only successes throughout Italy but also internationally. He is now the most famous and widely performed opera composer of the day. In this opera one can see his continued development to make the drama (the words) more important and a partner of the music in a seamless whole as truly a ""drama per musica"". In fact the older practice of an aria solo to reflect a state of mind followed by action recounted in recitative is greatly altered in Zelmira. There are no solo arias but duos with other characters or the chorus or trios or more. The action is going on as the singers are singing in stark contrast to the older methods of composition. This brings greater cohesion of the story and the music in the opera. However in Zelmira this more progressive form of opera development is mixed with older practices such as stopping the action for a florid vocal display as in the older style. The Rossini orchestra is now at its highest development - full use of tympani, horns and brass in addition to woodwinds and strings. His orchestral writing now is as great artistically as his vocal melodic. He is now thirty years old, world famous but tiring of the Neopolitan scene with its bickering critics. Though Zelmira does not have a lasting success his next opera does. That opera Semiramide (Venice 1823) will be a big international success. It will garner him offers from all over the operatic world and he, at the zenith of his powers, can pick and choose and he does - Paris.
There is only one word to describe this production ""silly"". Yes and distracting and annoying and a waste of money and effort. The use of mirrors showing maneuvers of writhing bodies under the stage, bodies being carted around, male nude bodies being bathed by comely females bely the directors lack of faith in Rossini that people will not be interested enough to pay attention to the opera but need some ""entertainment"" while the action is going on. A few gestures were creditable; the large ""classic"" statues reclining and then floating, the Greek word (psidos) etched large on the backdrop and then falling into dust and seeing images of the players on stage interacting in the background on a different size scale seemed integral to the plot. The breast feeding is obnoxious (titering little boy stuff) and the wrong legend. The whole production reeks of lack of true inspiration with too big a budget to waste on extravagant nothingness. As the EU nations are now on economic hard times I imagine the powers that be in Pesaro will not allow such artless waste of money and resorces to happen again.",1353888000,8,3737,4.733128834355829
5161503,5,B008H29Z18,Florez is my favourite tenor inthe wolrd today and I just don;t miss an opera where he sings the leading roll. What a great recording-and the fact that it is now recorded for the first time onDVD makes it more special,1353283200,,217,4.317073170731708
5161504,5,B008H29Z18,"""Bel Canto"" is a fair descriptor of the predominant vocal technique of opera and oratorio from the late 17th C to the early 19th. It's used more commonly, however, to classify the works of Rossini (1792-1868), Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835), and others less well-known. ""Beautiful Singing"" was the sine qua non of Baroque opera, and it's at least arguable that Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini can be best heard as ""late baroque"" in important ways. The retrospective hallmarks of Bel Canto include: smooth legato, wide seamless range, light and lovely timbres, impeccable breath control, NO dependency on vibrato for projection or to mask tuning and no excessive/constant use thereof, precise diction, and above all extreme agility in executing ornaments and divisions. It's a vocal technique best suited to small and acoustically supportive theaters; it's impossible to sing real Bel Canto in a gargantuan hall, and that's probably the chief reason that Bel Canto was superceded by Can Bellow in the operas of the later 19th C.

""Zelmira"" is a ""late Rossini"" opera -- premiered in 1822, and followed by only three completely new operas (Semiramide, Le Comte Ory, and Guillaume Tell -- but it bears no sign of surrender to post-BelCanto aesthetics. In fact, it's utterly Baroque and unrelenting in its demands for vocal technique. It has a libretto as silly as any by Handel and it poses vocal challenges that renowned singers of Verdi and Wagner, of the last generation, could not meet. Fortunately, this production was staged in the small Teatro Comunale di Bologna, with a proportionately small orchestra and with a cast of disproportionately brilliant singers. Yes, the staging is as dopey as the libretto, dopier if that's possible, with irrelevant flying symbols and headache-provoking camera work. The dramaturgy is ditzy. The costumes thrift-shoppy. But none of that matters! It's ""beautiful singing"" above all!

Zelmira turns out to be the perfect vehicle for the Bel Canto talents of Juan Diego Florez, talents he's never been allowed to display in any other production I've heard, either live or on DVD. His character, Ilo, makes his first entrance a good way into the opera, but when Florez sings his first aria, the audience shakes the theater with applause. The villain of the piece, Antenor, is sung by Gregory Kunde with such serene beauty that one can almost excuse his sins and blame his nastiness on his scheming underling Leucippo. But then Leucippo -- Mirco Palazzi -- also sings bello bello bel canto. Kate Aldrich sings gorgeously in the dramatically awkward role of Zelmira, but she's upstaged vocally by Marianna Pizzolato in the secondary role of her friend Emma. It seems that Rossini had an extraordinary singer available for that role in his reworking of the opera for the Paris stage, and so he inserted a scene for Emma all by herself and gave her the most dazzling aria of the show. Polidoro, the deposed king and father of Zelmira, emerges from secrecy in a temple crypt, a ghastly shadow of a man, yet he also gets his Bel Canto moments, sung with grave resplendence by Alex Esposito. I've named all the principals of this cast because they all equally deserve resounding applause for beautiful singing.

Okay, the DVD is a visual calamity, but DON'T be satisfied with a CD in its place. The drama is hard enough to follow even with stage business and subtitles. Put up with the crummy staging and relish the singing. It's perhaps the best and most authentic Bel Canto we'll hear in our lifetimes.",1352937600,4,3559,5.018612521150592
5161505,5,B008H29Z18,"I was so much in agreement with the review provided by John G. Gleeson Sr., that I haven't considered submitting my own for a while. However, it seems that a fair assertion of the production as a typical Regiatheater rubbish proves to be a turn-off for many opera lovers. There are several comments to the effect that people rather stick to audio CD than buy this set. It's wrong! Yes, the staging doesn't work, but all the performances are amazing, unparalleled vocally and fully developed and passionate dramatically. You simply have to watch Juan Diego Florez singing `Terra Amica', you won't get the whole range of emotions just by listening to him! I guarantee you would rewind and watch it over and over again in awe that such perfection can be achieved in a live performance. And Kate Aldrich was a total revelation for me too. Beauty of timbre, agility, legato line, intelligence of interpretation and she is a very good actress! I hope to see a lot more of her in bel canto roles in the future. Gregory Kunde turned out to be a much better a singer and an actor than I expected him to be, he is totally convincing as a villain. Even a supporting cast is very strong, with Marianna Pizzolata standing out, especially in her second act aria. Rossini composed one of his most beautiful scores for this opera, and orchestra under direction of Robberto Abbado sounds fantastic.

The key to enjoying Rossinis dramatic operas is ignoring the libretto.  In this day and age audiences are accustomed to reading subtitles in order to follow opera.  I believe Rossinis dramatic operas have fallen into obscurity because the librettos are so bad.  Case in point is Zelmira.

The entire plot of the opera relies on a single scene which is preposterous.

If you are watching opera videos because of the plot, you are missing out on some great music.  Zelmira, like many of Rossinis dramatic operas contain music that is on par with his most popular operas but the story is so stupid that nobody wants to perform them any more.  Luckily we have this DVD of Zelmira.

The story is crap.  The costumes and sets are drab.  The only reason to watch this DVD is for the music.

Juan Diego Florez is the Rossini singer of our time and possibly the best Rossini tenor of all time.  The sound quality of the stereo track is better than most CDs.

May be the budget was very limited in this production.",1458950400,,615,4.970873786407767
8527874,1,B008H29Z18,"Even though the orchestra, music, and singers are incredible, we couldn't get one of the first scenes out of our heads, where Zelmira's father performs an incestuous act upon her....it was disgusting to say the least! and totally unecessary!  We're sure that Rossini, himself, wouldn't have wanted such an act to be in any of his operas; plus, most of the scenery was atrocious.  It's a shame, that, due to these perversions, we were unable to give it the 5 stars that the orchestra, music, and singers all deserve.",1457222400,2,515,4.775280898876405
8527875,1,B008H29Z18,"Another European monstrosity, and this time from Pesaro, of all places. I thought of Pesaro as religious ground for Rossini's operas. No matter  the stupendous voice of Juan Diego Flores, to see him sing in a modern military uniform and surrounded by machine guns is more that I can swallow.
Opera is not only fine voices, It makes no sense to see an opera that takes place in ancient times in such an outrageous modern production. ""Pseudos"" is a very appropiate term for this thing. I hope the producer knew what he was doing when he decided to use the Greek word over
the throne of an ancient king in modern dress. I recommend buyers of this DVD to play it without video, because the performance is worthwhile and the music outstanding. Juan Diego and Aldrich merit five stars but the production deserves a thrash can.",1438300800,2,820,4.616438356164384
8527876,5,B008H29Z18,"I have already reviewed the DVD release of Zelmira, and took advantage of an amazon seller's really low price to upgrade to Blu ray.

My opinion of the performance remains the same: fabulous singing well worth the purchase, and horrible staging that while diminishing the overall effect, does nothing to diminish some outstanding vocal work from all singers. Florez and Aldrich are jaw droppingly outstanding! I can write endlessly about coloratura, range, timbre, etc., and not come close to finding enough superlatives to describe the effect. The rest of the cast do similarly outstanding work.

If you get past the staging, the mirrors, the changing of the time of the story, etc., you are in for an exceptional operatic experience.

Picture and sound have to be experienced to be appreciated.

WOW!",1434499200,3,802,5.099236641221374
8527877,3,B008H29Z18,"The production director is either mentally ill, partakes in Satanic rituals or is on drugs. Seriously it was painful to watch such an abomination amidst such beautiful music and talent. Get it just to hear and watch  Florez and Aldrich, both Bel Canto grandmasters. Mind you the director does everything possible to wrestle your attention away from beauty and pull you into his perverted consciousness. This opera would best have been performed without costumes or scenery or special effects...since they distract from the opera. Opera, symphonic score and performances 5 stars, production -2 stars. They could have been more generous with subtitles, but this is a problem with many operas on DVD.",1429401600,2,697,5.223214285714286
