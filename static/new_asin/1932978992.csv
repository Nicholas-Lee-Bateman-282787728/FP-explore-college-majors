7801626,5,1932978992,"I purchased this video, while at the GL-FFF Michigan Fly Tying Show.  I had watched Julie tie the year before. I had purchase flies she tied for Gates AuSable Lodge and fished them over the summer.  Up to this point, I didn't care much for tying parachutes.  I fumbled around with them but I like to get a fly tied in a couple of minutes or I just don't bother.  Parachutes took me considerably more time. It was less frustrating to buy them.  I ran into Julie again at the show this year, and decided to purchase her video.  After all, she tied those things pretty quick and after fishing with them all summer I knew they didn't fall apart, like parachutes often do from other sources.  Nothing to loose.  This was clearly one of the better fly tying videos I've viewed. Each step was presented clearly and she uses several diffent type of posting materials throughout the video.  I was finally able to clearly see how to tie the feather down which is where I used to get into a mess.  I practiced using these techniques and it wasn't very long before I was pumping out top shop quality parachute Adams in three minutes time.  With my confidence now up, I started to scale down the size of the flies.  I'm tying #22 flies with ease.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in tying Parachute patterns.",1233187200,,1313,4.443514644351464
