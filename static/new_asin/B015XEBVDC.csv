7453844,5,B015XEBVDC,"I owned all three of these beautiful DVDs before they were put into a 3 disc set and I love each one. First the Fireplace DVD - this is a great Fireplace DVD for Christmas. It really gets you into a festive mood!  With all of the options for fireplaces, music, natural sound, etc. - it really is an extremely versatile DVD. The fires take up the screen and the Christmas fireplace is really cheery with all of the Christmas decorations (and Christmas music if you like that). If you want a DVD with different themes, then this is the one for you. High quality, sharp photography too. It is very well done!
Then there's the Christmas DVD.  I'm not into all the Christmas figures, etc. that were at the beginning, but that's just me, and I'm sure I'm in the minority here.  It's such a small part of this DVD, so that part didn't bother me at all.  The DVD also has gorgeous films on it, fireplace, winter snow video, and fireworks too. They were all done in excellent fashion, I especially like fireworks, although it doesn't really remind me of Christmas all that much, but they're always beautiful. Mr. Helsloot's company has the BEST fireworks DVD I've ever been able to find (it's called Fireworks Shows and it is amazing!). But back to this Christmas DVD, There is one section called Natural Decoration that has the most beautiful films. One is called Glitters and shows a beautiful sparkling lake at night -  that part alone gave me a wonderful sense of peace and tranquility. It also has 2 different candle films. I could watch these candles continuously - they just mesmerize me. There is quiet Christmas music on the films if you want to hear that too.- the overall effect is calm and peaceful - and isn't that what you want on Christmas??  I Do.

I also really enjoyed the Winter DVD!  The photography is awesome and it's calming and peaceful for me to watch snow fall, as long as I don't have to be out in the cold to see it. So these kinds of DVDs are perfect for me. The music in the first video was especially relaxing. I did mute the classical music at the last part of the DVD because that's not really my style. But it's still SO awesome to see the snow, waterfall, and huge icicles in the film. You really don't need music for that (or you could substitute your own preference). Visually, this DVD kept me glued to the TV, I didn't want to look away and miss anything. Great photography and a wonderful view of Winter is all here.  I love it.  Absolutely 5 stars! It's really nice to be cozy inside and be able to see the grandeur of Winter!

All together, these three DVDS in one package is a GREAT deal!",1447545600,22,2622,4.396694214876033
7453845,5,B015XEBVDC,"This Christmas Collection DVDs are really great. Here's a bit of everything for the upcoming Christmas Time. Starting from winter landscapes accompanied by music and recordings of Christmas decorations up to fireplaces and fireworks and also other recordings. Thus, you have the perfect accompaniment directly for any occasion. I will definitely let the DVD run at Christmas as a background. The image quality I liked very well here. I can only recommend this DVD collection.",1447545600,7,475,5.346666666666667
7453846,5,B015XEBVDC,"I like this versatile DVD box very well. There is not only a lot of fire which can be played either with Christmas music or even the sounds of the crackling logs. There are also beautiful scenes with falling snow, but also very much christmassy. You find Christmas decorations there, flickering candles or even fireworks for New Years Eve or other celebration. I really lik the colors of the Christmas decorations, they just shine brilliantly. The Christmas music being played throughout the DVDs, immediately promote the Christmas spirit. The Christmas fireplace, which can be seen on one of the DVDs, is one of my favorites. Now I have an almost real Christmas fireplace in my house for the holidays.",1446940800,9,702,4.907563025210084
7453847,5,B015XEBVDC,"I love snowy landscapes and the warmth of a real fireplace, but I live in a tropical climate and I can't get to enjoy that.  This DVD collection is the next best thing!  So real, so beautiful! It will help create the right atmosphere for Christmas and feel like I'm in the northern hemisphere somewhere instead of my tropical city.  You can watch a trailer on the creators website:  worldnaturevideo.com - Recommended!",1446854400,13,418,4.763888888888889

8735015,5,B015XEBVDC,"This is a beautiful DVD. The quality is excellent and I cannot wait for the holidays so I can let friends and family share it. It will be great for those times when you don't want to watch TV, but, you like something cheerful and special in the background to set the mood when sharing coffee with friends or family, or playing with the grandkids, or even wrapping gifts. I love it and I am so glad I ordered.",1502582400,,408,4.177215189873418
