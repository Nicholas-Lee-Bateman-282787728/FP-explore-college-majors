5880072,3,B00DZBZPHY,"(This review is for the Steven Seagal compilation. For reasons unknown, Amazon is also displaying it on the page of the Jean-Claude Van Damme collection of the same title)

Much like the previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Action-Classics-Unleashed/dp/B00DSDUVFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Action Classics Unleashed</a>&nbsp;compilation, this is a sampling of Steven Seagal's direct-to-video movies. None of his theatrical outings can be found here, just some of the relatively low budgeted works he released between 2003 and 2007. Unlike the other collection, this one is less balanced: most of these films aren't all that great of vehicles for Seagal and probably won't even particularly appeal to fans, except for that last one.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-Fury/dp/B000LPR6G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of Fury</a>&nbsp;is a remake of Michael Dudikoff's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Thunder/dp/B000077VQN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Thunder</a>, and while that one might not be all that great to begin with, Seagal's version is worse. There's an acceptable amount of action, but little of it is satisfying. The movie's depiction of Afghanistan - where Americans can live in any old neighborhood and lesbians can hold positions of authority within militant networks - will look pretty silly even to someone who's only occasionally followed international news in the last ten years.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-a-Kill/dp/B00009ZPTZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for a Kill</a>&nbsp;is, by general consensus, one of Seagal's very worst films. Its story is a fairly straightforward action yarn, but the inconsistent production design would have you think it's an arthouse exercise. Hong Kong-style action is ample throughout, including scenes with assassin monks and a monkey kung fu barber, but it's often confounded by incessantly slow motion or sped up footage. Seagal plays an Ivy League professor and utters a ton of poetic nonsense.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Man/dp/B000F6IOCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow Man</a>&nbsp;is a murky, European-set thriller. Steven demonstrates the ""death touch"" technique by making a watermelon explode and manages to blow up a helicopter with a handgun, but that's the end of cool things this one has going for it. The story is convoluted and the motives of the characters are unclear to the point that you really question why anything is going on. Action scenes are brief and ugly. Good luck remembering any of the faceless characters' names.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;provides a much needed shot of adrenaline and quality to the collection, and is probably the best (or only) reason for casual fans to buy this one. The simple revenge story is bolstered by solid production values, good hand-to-hand fights and a neat car chase, and surprisingly sound dramatic performances. Eddie Griffin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-Eddie/dp/B001O4KBMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm & Eddie</a>) plays the lead villain, and performs some his best acting outside of his comedy norm.

Personally, I've come to enjoy individual aspects of even the movies I described negatively, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend any of the features besides ""Urban Justice."" If you're trying to complete your Seagal filmography on a budget, then go for this one, but otherwise find a different collection.",1388275200,5,3763,6.878406708595388
5880073,5,B00DZBZPHY,"Mostly I like all of the movies of STEVEN SEAGAL and VAN DAMME, but my top 10 best movies that I give more higher ratings are these action classics. Plus STEVEN SEAGAL'S ATTACK FORCE, INTO THE SUN, ASSASSINATION GAMES, DOUBLE TEAM, UNTIL DEATH, MAXIMUM RISK. These movies are my favorites of STEVEN SEAGAL and VAN DAMME because they show their fury and strength when they are harmed in any way. I enjoy watching them in action and their fights are totally out of this world also the stories of these 10 movies are pretty interesting. UNLEASH THE FIRE GUYS!!!

P.S. THEIR FIGHTING SKILLS ARE OUTSTANDING AND IT MATCHES WELL WITH THEIR DEADLY PERSONALITY, WHICH IS LETHAL!!!",1376611200,,672,4.793103448275862

5880086,4,B00DZBZPHY,"This is a 2-disc DVD set of Van Damme's less popular movies. I have not seen any of the movies on this collection yet and the only movie that I was aware of coming in was 'Double Team'(1997) with Dennis Rodman. The newest movie in this set is 'Assassination Games'(2011) which is fairly recent(when I think of Van Damme, I think of the late 80's and 90's).  The four movies are divided into 2 movies for each disc and there are no special features(except for subtitles on 'Double Team').

Good value for this set as it is around five to six bucks for four movies. There are better Van Damme sets out there with his earlier and more well-known movies(such as 'Kickboxer' or 'Bloodsport') but for those who have not seen these, this set is a decent choice because of the low price but for the most part you won't get the non-stop martial arts action of his earlier movies.",1435708800,,870,4.43125
