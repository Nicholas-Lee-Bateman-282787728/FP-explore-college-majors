8475227,5,B000B6TK8G,"I now own the entire series of four volumes from Incredible Story Studios and am very pleased with the set as good solid entertainment for 12 to 16 year old teenagers. Each story exhibits a human aspect common to a child's point of view, and regularly winds up ending with a moral to the story.  After all, these stories were all written by teenagers who are introduced very briefly at the beginning and end of each episode.  Also, these are short stories averaging 10-12 minutes and easily hold the attention of the viewer. The young teen moderator of this series is very entertaining, but just a little repetitive by the time you get to volume three. The cost of this series is very reasonable and adds to its appeal. Go for it.",1254700800,5,730,4.5227272727272725
