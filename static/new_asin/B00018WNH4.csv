1978143,4,B00018WNH4,"It hurts me to give Sean Corn less than 5 stars because I can  feel her enthusiasm and love for what she is teaching and she is obviously totally genuine but I, a beginner, have fairly quickly outgrown the DVD. The session spends too little time on each pose (three breaths rather than five) and the yoga ""workout"" is not what I wish it were. On the other hand, no Yoga DVD I have is as thorough at explaining the postures and the modifications as this one. If you are a true beginner, this is a great DVD to start with. When Sean Corn comes out with an intermediate DVD, I will be first in line!",1081728000,19,596,4.137931034482759
1978144,5,B00018WNH4,"sean corn is one of the most dynamic and beautiful yoga teachers today. she has a wonderful and giving heart. the practice that she takes you through is gentle for old-timers and newcomers. i have been blessed to have been able to study with her in person and this is the next best thing.
a must for all ages and abilities!!!",1079481600,2,325,4.344262295081967
1978145,5,B00018WNH4,"I truly believe that Seane's DVD is amazing and suitable for all levels.  Vinyasa flow is the practice of incorporating movement and breath into one.  It may seem that this DVD is not physically challenging or that it is geared for beginners but that is not so.  Try following the breathing portion and see how difficult it really is!!!
  Most people are unaware that they do not breathe properly during their practice. What a great way to really learn how to incorporate proper breathing techniques and bring your practice to the next level.  The better you breathe the more oxygen your muscles have and the healthier and more energized you'll be in your practice and in your life.
  For those of you who say this is not challenging, I challenge you to try breathing the right way.  It's not as easy as one would think.
I give Seane 5 stars!!!  Buy a copy today!
She takes the practice and art of yoga to a whole new level.  Her voice is not harsh at all, rather it is full of knowledge and quite soothing if you are open and listen intently.  Bravo for you Seane, keep up the good work.",1079395200,11,1088,4.4120603015075375
1978146,1,B00018WNH4,this is way too slow for the average practioner. Personally i think there are much better dvds out there. I find Sean's voice kind of harsh and not very soothing. She has a very 'masculine' energy if that makes sense.,1079222400,5,217,4.45
1978147,5,B00018WNH4,"This two dvd vinyasa flow practice is amazing. Seane's teaching style is top of the line. Dvd number one, is an instructional session where Seane guides you through the practice. In dvd number two, Seane guides you through the practice set to music without verbal instruction. There is also an informative interview with Seane. This dvd hands down is an exceptional buy.",1078272000,2,370,4.983870967741935
1978148,5,B00018WNH4,"I've bought quite a few yoga DVDs and haven't been very happy with them.  Especially ones by fitness industry experts who crank out a video for every fad that comes around.  Seane Corn is a well respected yoga teacher who has been teaching/pracitcing for 14 years, I believe I read.  She was also chosen to represent yoga for Nike.  This DVD is different in that she's not teaching a class - it's filmed to seem as if it is a one-on-one with the viewer.  If you've never heard of Seane Corn do a Google search on her to see some of the amazing poses she does.  I've only been doing yoga for a few months so some of the power yoga videos are too difficult.  This one is challenging, yet can be done by someone who hasn't been practicing for years.  I highly recommend this one.  I absolutely love it!  I can't wait for her to make another one.",1078185600,6,842,4.238993710691824
1978213,5,B00018WNH4,She is great.  Clearly explains moves.,1410307200,,38,5.333333333333333
1978214,4,B00018WNH4,"Sean is a great instructor and the flow is a perfect balance of strength, flexibility and breath...she leads you into the next pose in a timely way, so you don't have to constantly be looking at the screen to know what pose she's doing now rather, you can just focus on your movements and breath while she leads you to your next movement.  Great for beginners :)",1389744000,,362,4.402985074626866
1978215,1,B00018WNH4,"I get that sun salutations and downward dog are the cornerstone of yoga, but you do them every other move.  She spends so much time on those she only gets in the other basics like the warrior poses, etc. in in an entire hour.  She seems to go from pose to pose quite quickly (have to get those sun salutations and downward dogs in after all) that i feel that you don't get to do much more then stretch the ligaments around your joints.  I purchased this CD to start building a dvd library.  I have and enjoy Power Yoga for Every Body, but wanted the variety that different instructors bring.  It has a good balance of letting the ligments relax around your joints and then getting in muscle stretching and strengthening.  I borrowed a couple Rodney Yee ones from the library and found that it wasn't about balance at all more like an unbalanced work out  that barely focused on form and breathing at all.

In the instructional segment of this video she talks nonstop.  This is actually good because she is going through the finer points of form - very important.  I wouldn't want the spiel every time though, so I was excited to see that there was a second, non-instructional version. Well that one she doesn't talk at all! I can see keeping talking to a minimum, but with out her even murmuring the next pose, you have to watch the screen constantly, which keeping your head facing the tv kind of defeats the whole proper form thing.",1380585600,5,1434,4.459770114942529
1978216,5,B00018WNH4,I borrowed this DVD from a friend and loved it.  I take classes twice a week but wanted something to do at home when I couldn't get to class.  This was the closest thing to the style I am used to and it is very clear and precise and easy to follow,1376006400,,247,3.730769230769231
1978217,5,B00018WNH4,This is the most comprehensive video I have purchased.  I love the way Sean teaches the poses.  Sean holds the poses long enough to make a difference.  Highly recommend for beginners.,1375920000,2,183,4.838709677419355
1978218,3,B00018WNH4,"I was looking for something a bit more mellow, like my yoga class. Was not expecting someone who talked a hundred miles an hour. It's a great dvd for watching and learning the practice, but I would never want this chick for my teacher.",1372550400,,235,4.363636363636363
1978219,1,B00018WNH4,The second half of this DVD is silent with no cues so how are you supposed to follow the sequence ?,1367280000,2,99,3.761904761904762
1978220,4,B00018WNH4,Just wonderful. Solid re-introduction to yoga for me. Great workout  and thorough practice. I am starting to move on in my practice but return to this once and awhile to keep grounded. I learn something from Seane every time I use this video.,1366156800,,242,4.627906976744186
1978221,4,B00018WNH4,"Overall, this was a very good beginning yoga DVD.  The flow is slow enough for a beginner to keep up with but not so slow as to be boring.  I use this DVD on weekends when I have more time because it is quite lengthy.",1361750400,,217,3.8
1978222,5,B00018WNH4,Sean is one of the best in her field and I appreciate her style. I recommend this DVD to anyone.,1360281600,,96,3.85
1978263,2,B00018WNH4,"It would be so great if the second video provided some spoken guidance instead of just being a silent vinyasa routine. There is no way that I could follow this without stopping, pausing the video and watching the sequence over and over - which defeats the purpose, I think. I don't really understand why there's no narrative. I purchased this after listening to a beautiful interview with Seane Corne via On Being.",1352764800,,414,4.763888888888889
1978264,1,B00018WNH4,"There are two chapters on this DVD. Neither are useful in a yoga practice.

The first isn't so much a workout as it is a lecture. I found this out in a very disappointing way when I dressed up in my yoga pants and set aside an hour to get a nice vinyasa practice in. Instead, I spent the hour wondering when we were actually going to do a vinyasa. Never happened. There was certainly some interesting information in her talk, but to call it a workout or a practice would be wildly misleading.

Okay, maybe the second chapter is where the actual workout is. Yes. Well, sort of. It's where her (Seane) workout is. Not yours. What do I mean by that? Well, there is absolutely no instruction in the workout, just a creepy loud breathing track as she works out in silence. As anyone who has ever practiced yoga can tell you, you need to have verbal instructions to follow along, as you spend a lot of time facing downwards and unable to see the screen if you are trying to follow along with what she is doing. I reasoned that there must be an alternative audio track with verbal instruction and spent a lot of time in submenus searching for one. I'll save you some time. There isn't one.

I don't know what the folks at Gaiam were thinking with this DVD but if I could find my receipt I'd be getting my money back.

USELESS!",1351036800,2,1319,4.285140562248996
1978265,1,B00018WNH4,"The two DVD's have nothing to do with each other!  The first one is instructional and it is ok, but full of incorrect directions, she is inconsistent with giving you the names of the poses, & it is not a vinyasa flow.  But, not a bad workout so, you move on to the next dvd & think she'll put it all together for you.... you are wrong.  The second dvd has no instruction, no pose names called out,....nothing but silence.  How are you supposed to follow along, breathe, find yourself in the poses and watch?  I was so frustrated by this expensive set.  Save your money.",1348617600,,569,4.320754716981132
1978266,5,B00018WNH4,"I found a recommendation for this in a review for another yoga DVD, and I'm really grateful. The depth of the instruction and attention to detail are wonderful - I can really feel the difference it makes. This will work for a complete beginner, but is also great for someone like me with years of yoga experience. I learned how better to hold the positions and the difference to how I feel is tremendous. I haven't been exercising for about the last 9 months, and it's difficult to get started again without injuring myself. In the last 3 days I have done about half of the workout each day and I have much more energy during the day and wake up feeling much better.",1344988800,2,666,4.379032258064516
1978267,2,B00018WNH4,"I wouldn't say I didn't like the practice itself, but the way they introduced it on the dvds doesn't make much sense. DVD 1 has too many instructions (would be ok if Seane didn't speak too fast, it's just distracting). So I tried DVD 2 - their breathing practice, and this one is absolutely useless. No verbal instructions at all - I don't know who could use it - unless you have extra pair of eyes on the back of your head, or you first learn this practice by heart:)",1344556800,,468,4.211111111111111
1978268,5,B00018WNH4,"I have purchased several DVD's on Yoga and this is by far superior, very relaxing, hits my comfort zone, thanks",1338681600,,111,4.6
1978269,5,B00018WNH4,"Usually you already know what you are doing, make sure you get Session One first. Disk 2 assumes you know Disk 1 very well. Disc 1 is the 'verbal instructions' ... Disc 2 does not say a word. I am 60, have COPD, and a BMI of 42.5 (that means I am way over weight). I will most likely never be able to do this well (in fact I'm sure I look very funny trying). But Seane Corn has an 'air about her' that makes me believe whatever I do is better than I was yesterday. The movements are excellent for my body, the focus on each breath is now a must for me and I most definitely need the spiritual help and the inward focus (you can see and feel this 'focus' throughout the entire Disk 2). Enjoy, Dale",1333065600,2,696,3.9785714285714286
1978270,1,B00018WNH4,"The 1st dvd would probably be very helpful to new yogi's to help them understand proper form; however, the 2nd dvd was the exact same routine with no audio cues what so ever! Considering this is a beginner II/ intermediate level dvd I would assume that there would be a more difficult routine option, especially with a two dvd pack. It is impossible to know the cues for each movement in the 2nd dvd because there are no instructions; you have to strain your neck to look up. They should have used a set amount of breaths for each pose OR had some sort of audio. I was looking forward to a challenge but Seane didn't even use full chaturangas, she demonstrated only versons on the knees and baby cobras! Not what I expected from an intermediate dvd.",1331164800,,749,4.434782608695652
1978271,5,B00018WNH4,"I have been looking for a yoga dvd to do at home, but there are so many bad ones out there. I was thrilled to find this one. She is an excellent instructor!",1318982400,,156,3.757575757575758
1978272,4,B00018WNH4,I would recommend this DVD to those who are new to the practice.  It is a bit slow if you have been practicing for a while.,1318464000,,123,3.730769230769231
1978323,1,B00018WNH4,"Seane Corn is obviously an accomplished practitioner, but this DVD is useless to me as a practice video.  The first instructional section is more of a reference on proper form that you might review once a quarter. As for trying to follow the actual flow sequence (which is why I bought this) with no cues - no way.  Very bad for the neck and spine to have to try to watch and do the poses at the same time. I can't believe with her painstaking instruction in part one, she thinks this is a good idea!  So sorry I spent the money on this one.",1310256000,3,541,4.133333333333334
1978324,1,B00018WNH4,"A lot of this video (at least, the first disc) is Seane talking rapidly about how one should experience their practice.  She seems overly self-conscious, and is so focused on describing what she's doing in as many words possible that it's hard to follow her meaning. Her chatter was so distracting made it impossible for me to focus on the practice itself. I didn't watch the second DVD because I was so frustrated with the first one. Look up Seane Corn on Youtube if you want to see if this video is right for you.",1309651200,,515,4.421052631578948

1978327,4,B00018WNH4,"I loved Seane Corn and the level and expertise of instruction provided in the instructional DVD. I would highly recommend it for beginners or someone that is looking for a slow paced and detail-oriented practice. However, I think the title of this DVD is misleading. I have come to think of Vinyasa Flow as a moving practice where you are constantly moving from one pose to the next, building up heat in the body. This DVD is not that so much as focusing on one pose at a time.",1289606400,4,477,4.370786516853933
1978328,2,B00018WNH4,"Love Seane Corn and was super excited for this dvd. The breakdown of basics first disc was great, but wanted so much more from the 2nd disc which was breath centered...Ok Seane, how am i supposed to follow you in motion & breath if you're not talking?! I don't practice yoga so that I can sit & watch you do it...I would have loved for a little narration & direction in the second disc, what a bummer!",1286236800,4,401,4.220779220779221

1978330,4,B00018WNH4,"This is the best DVD I've found to guide a home practice. If I'm feeling like I want to be talked through improving my poses, the first disk is great. I love Corn's clarity and precision. If I'm feeling like just doing the sequence, I use the second disk and really like guiding my pace with the breathing audio with no talking. It is a great guide.",1255392000,,349,4.223880597014926
1978331,5,B00018WNH4,"The reason why this DVD elicits such dramatically different reactions is that people look for different things in yoga.  If you are looking for a calisthenic workout, or want to lose ten pounds of sweat, or expect second-by-second ""color commentary,"" this DVD is not what you're looking for.  But if you're looking for a routine that will take you to the meditative heart of yoga, this is one of the very few DVDs that will transport you there.  Like many other yoga DVDs, this one provides a loosely ashtanga-based sequence of asanas that is aimed at advanced beginners and intermediate practitioners. This DVD is almost unique, however, in its focus on the breath.  For that reason, the pace is very slow -- so that you can breathe fully into each posture without compromise -- and there is no running commentary to distract you.  (The practice DVD is accompanied by an instructional DVD that does talk you through the asanas and demonstrate them, but the practice DVD itself is silent.)  The absence of verbal cues during the practice makes it hard to follow this routine the first few times you try it because you have to keep your eyes glued to the television screen to follow along, which is no mean feat.  After a few repetitions, however, you'll absorb the sequence and then be able to focus on coordinating breath and asana, which is the whole purpose of this DVD.  That's when you'll be able to delve into the meditative aspect of the practice.",1252022400,11,1454,4.719367588932807
1978332,1,B00018WNH4,"This video is terrible.  It is waaaaaaaaayyyyy to slow!!!! I just bought it and it should not be considered a workout video.  If someone is totally new at yoga and wants to see someone get into each move very slowly and listen to them talk this is the DVD for you.  If you want a workout this is not for you! Now, I'm oversees and have to order a new DVD.",1246233600,2,355,3.971830985915493
1978389,1,B00018WNH4,"i wish i'd read all the low reviews before i blew the cash on this DVD set. it is astonishing that there are no verbal cues at all on the 2nd disc. to have to look up at the screen to see what she's up to next is extremely bad for the neck and thus blows the whole zen of the practice.

it seems that people are IN LOVE with seane corn -and that's OK- as she's a very good technician. her vocal tone is a bit abrasive at times but she definitely knows what's proper alignment and breathing.

gaiam should be ashamed. the DVD set is just bad. if you want a great challenging audio practice (but no visual) try ""the yogi's companion"" by lauren petersen. it's excellent.",1244505600,7,667,4.162790697674419
1978390,1,B00018WNH4,"I consider myself an intermediate practitioner. Living in a small town, I rely on dvd's as a source of yoga classes. So I own many dvd's . I found Seane talked far too fast and with an excited tone (not very relaxing). She does not name the poses. It would have been to her benefit to have had a student going through the moves as she talked through the routine. She was not in time with the breath because she was talking. Sometimes she would mention to pick up the props after she had moved to the other side and the prop was left behind. I was unable to enjoy the dvd. And the second dvd has no verbal instruction. That is pointless unless you plan to sit back and watch her go through the routines. Makes no sense to me.",1241308800,16,724,4.141843971631205
1978391,2,B00018WNH4,The tapes demonstrate good technique and form.  The poses are good for beginners and similar to what I have experienced in other beginning classes. The beginning of the first tape has too much talking and then the second tape has no talking at all.  It is very difficult to participate in the yoga poses using correct form and breathing to get the desired benefits when there are no verbal cues as to when to change poses. You have to constantly turn to see if she has moved or not.  I have use many excercise tapes and have never had one without at least the option for verbal cues.,1237593600,5,583,4.37962962962963

1978395,1,B00018WNH4,"I consider myself an intermediate yoga practitioner.  I found this DVD so frustrating!  The first disc was overly wordy.  I felt Seane wouldn't stop over explaining poses.  (Good for beginners possibly?)  Oh - and on that topic, she never named the poses.  Odd?  After watching ten minutes of the first disc, I popped in the second, hoping for some challenging flow.

I was shocked to find absolutely NO verbal cues accompanied her movements.  Nothing.  This is so disappointing considering you can do serious damage to your neck by looking up in full poses.  I really can't believe Gaiam released this DVD.  Did anyone on the editing crew actually think about what this might be like to actually follow?  How am I to know when to when to move into different poses without watching the screen constantly?  I've done hundreds of hours of yoga, and this was by far one of the worst DVD's I've bought.  It's near impossible to follow.

I'm sure Seane is a great instructor... when she's actually instructing.  I thought I was buying an at-home-yoga-class on DVD.  I have no use to watch her move through a beautiful vinyasa.

What I appreciate most about this DVD is the way in which Seane focuses on alignment and breathing in the vinyasa. I also found, for a beginner, that her explanations were very helpful and I notice something new about them every time I use the DVD. I also the way she builds up her ""Sun Salutes...to their kind of completion"" (as she puts it) piece by piece--I've found Sun Salutes kind of dizzying, so slowly assembling them bit by bit was very helpful. I appreciate very much how much she focuses on alignment. I find she hits a very happy medium for me between hyperactive ashtanga flows (hard for a beginner to jump into...) and the often slow pace of Iyengar beginners classes.

As someone who deals with anxiety issues, I found her discussion in the interview about yoga and her OCD to be very interesting and inspiring.",1218672000,,878,4.515723270440252

My usual pet peave with instructional dvds regarding lack of breathing and form instructions do not apply here because Corn explains all this in great detail while performing the movements.  I appreciate this since you can cancel benefits of any practice/workout with improper breathing and movements.  It is long but the chapters are arranged nicely; we usually break it into two segments, around 30 min ea(alternating days).  There is also a full session without the instructions (we haven't used that yet since we still benefit from the instructions).",1217721600,,753,4.8515625
1978421,1,B00018WNH4,"I had read other reviews and thought I would give Seane Corn a try. Now, I'm wondering what to do with this video that I spent money on...? This video is fine for beginners that do not have any yoga experience. This is a two DVD set. First: The step by step instruction is very helpful for beginners, but for those who know and enjoy the poses, her voice and constant talking gets overwhelming. Your body feels good after, but there is nothing stimulating for the spirit, which leaves one NOT in a state of peace and harmony. Second DVD: There are no instructions, so one needs to look at the t.v. the whole session until of course, you memorize the poses. Not a Great flow... Not good for a mind, body, & spirit connection. And certainly not good to watch over and over.",1205280000,4,771,4.361111111111111
1978422,5,B00018WNH4,I'm enjoying this DVD.  The instructor's spirit and compassion are comforting and encouraging.  The DVD is beautifully produced.  I appreciate the sounds of breathing in the background during the sessions.,1204156800,,205,5.766666666666667
1978423,5,B00018WNH4,"Fantastic program by Sean Corn.  She is an amazing teacher.  Really simple to follow, so you can just surrender to her instructions.  Loved it and highly recommend it.",1200614400,2,167,4.892857142857143
1978424,5,B00018WNH4,"My first real exposure to yoga was 5 years ago when I went to a Bikram studio for about 6 months religiously, then the studio closed and all I could find left were lousy gym-yoga sessions where the instructor is more interested in doing the yoga herself than making sure the participants are doing the poses correctly.

That said, I am rather picky about my yoga and have tried several DVDs. This is the first one I have come across that I have kept and done countless times over the past 2 years I have owned it. She cues superbly and her focus on form is so vitally important for anyone practicing these forms because of the high risk of injury if done incorrectly. I am a physical therapist and thus I recognize the importance of form in any exercise. I am a fairly active person and I always work up a light sweat with this, I ALWAYS feel stronger, taller, leaner, and healthier when I am done and all the next day. Additionally, if I haven't done this DVD in a few weeks, I can count on having a good bit of rewarding muscle soreness the next day or 2. I have also done this DVD with a few friends who are true beginners and they all commented at how on spot her cues were and that they felt like they knew what they were supposed to do, and how to do it safely.

This is a great workout, and a great way to quite your mind and reconnect with your body. One thing I learned early with yoga, is that you get out of it what you put into it.

Namaste",1200355200,3,1452,4.123674911660777
1978425,3,B00018WNH4,"What really annoys me about this video is that she gives detailed instruction on all the intricacies of the position but often never tells you what the position is. So you're left thinking - ""what the heck is this?"".  This leads to a lot of confusion. As a beginner instruction what would be wrong with saying ""this is xxxx pose"" and then teaching it. Instead you are taken through all parts of the poses without knowing what is connected to what.
Also, the second DVD is really frustrating too. At first I thought it all would make more sense when she runs through it all on the second CD. (it shows her going through the poses to music & you can hear her breath.)
But again no direction as to names of poses - so you are trying to follow along, but how are you supposed to see the poses while you are in the positions?! If I'm doing downward facing dog how am I supposed to see the TV to know what she is doing next since there is no vocal direction! All I do is wind up hurting my neck. You hear her breath but that can't guide you since she doesn't always hold the pose for 1 breath.
This DVD is extremely frustrating. I wasted tons of time trying to understand it. It should have been called ""Pretty Girl Makes You Wish You Knew Yoga""",1171756800,8,1239,4.205882352941177
1978426,3,B00018WNH4,"I was looking for something to fill in the time after the birth of my daughter before I returned to the gym.  My yoga instructor suggested Seane Corn, but this is not the DVD for me.

From my pov, this a very beginner DVD, an excellent beginner DVD, but as an advanced student I was frustrated. There is a lot of explanation and her theory (her attention to detail is excellent), and a verrrrry sloooow flow. Too slow for me and while I suppose I could breath slower, I'm looking to really warm up and give the body a work out, which this didn't do for me. Plus the lack of audio on the second disc is a huge negative. For me, once I know a routine, the audio is the most important part, cueing me to move from pose to pose. This forces you to constantly look at the screen to follow, which takes you out of alignment and out of the moment.",1164153600,14,840,4.115853658536586
1978427,5,B00018WNH4,"While no expert, I'm not a beginner with regards to yoga.  This DVD, though perfect for beginners, was also very helpful to me.  It was like taking a yoga class one-on-one with a very clear and talented instructor.  It really focused my attention on where, exactly, your body should be in each individual pose and where your attention should be and where your breath should be.  Also, though this is more of a superficial thing, her demeanor and voice were calm and upbeat and not annoying.  (that frequently decides whether I will keep or give away a DVD)  This would not be the only yoga DVD to practice with, but it would certainly be something to come back to to refocus on the basics.  I did feel like it deepened my other practices as well.  Highly recommended, excellent for beginners but also for people like me who do not get to go to yoga class very frequently.  I will definitely be getting her second flow DVD.",1162771200,7,922,4.506024096385542
1978467,3,B00018WNH4,"I gave this start 3 stars.  5 starts for the instructional DVD.  (This is a 2 DVD set)  I think it's a fantastic place for beginners to start.  Seane Corn gives you plenty of time to learn and feel the pose and lots of verbal cues .  Some people don't, but I also appreciate the spiritual side which is left out in many DVD's focusing only on the ""excerise"" side of Yoga...

Okay for the 2nd Vinyasa flow DVD...only 1 star. With absolutely no verbal cueing, those of us who have a TV above 12"" on the ground must constantly look up to see what the instructor is doing.  (Ironically, the very first pose is done with your eye's closed)

I bought this DVD because I have number of instructional DVD's and wanted a pure flow DVD to follow....this one isn't it. Just a cue that the move is changing would have made a huge difference in my score.",1162425600,10,841,4.245283018867925
1978468,5,B00018WNH4,By far my favorite DVD. Sean Corne is great! This one is a must have!,1158537600,3,69,3.6666666666666665
1978469,5,B00018WNH4,"Seane Corn is simply not your typical Yofga teacher. She speaks very, very quickly, but somehow comunicates her mesage precisely. The speed of her delivery relates more to enthusiasm than to any urgency.

Vinyasa Yoga is an ideal form of Yoga for those who are most interested in muscular flexibility, refinement of breathing, and inner peace.  For those with knee problems (and provided they advantag take of towels, pads and other knee-protective tools) Vinyasa Yoga is easier on the joints than most, strengthening the lower back, quadruceps, back muscles and spirit all at once.

While Ms. Corn is clearly beautiful, her beauty is valuable only to the extent that it commands more precise attention, and especially from male viewers. Her words are far more magnetic, and her teaching skills are extraordinary.

For me, this first lesson could occupy a year. Ms. Corn, emphasizes the importance of learning in stride and committing the positions to memory along the way, The regimen she provides, however, makes this fairly easy.

It matters not whether you believe in a particular god or form of religion. Ms. Corn's approach is to honor life with exercise and breath and to extend our gratitude for health to our fellows. That is more than acceptable.

Gaiam's production is uncommonly good, and postures are all captured beautifully in backlit profile. The musical acompaniment is logical and congenial.

Best of all, the package comntains two discs, one for instruction and training and the second for untutored practice.

This is a wonderful way to initiate people of al ages to Yoga without peril, however some users should consult a physician with any doubts or concerns befofe proceeding with this training.

A lovely, healing and high-value DVD taught by an instructor who cares.",1157155200,10,1791,5.1271477663230245
1978470,3,B00018WNH4,"I was a bit disappointed with this DVD.  I'd been doing yoga for about a year when I received this DVD.  The Instructional Session(disc 1) is diffenately for beginners.  Sean gives excellent instruction, but I was quickly bored with it.  The Breath Session(disk 2) has ZERO instruction:  she doesn't speak a single word!  I would have liked her to tell the name of the position to move into.  Eventhough this is excellent for the breathing portion of your practice (you actually hear Sean's breath), I found that I had to look at my TV too often(which is not too great for yoga poses).  I often find myself in a twist too long or not long enough when I look back at my television.  I felt as if I were spying on Sean Corn's private yoga session.",1156291200,11,745,4.419117647058823
1978471,5,B00018WNH4,"Seane Corn is beautiful and encouraging! She prepares you for the flow by going over each pose first , and then puts it all together. It may be a little challenging for a beginner, but it is definately not impossible. The ending prayer is great! You'll most assuredly feel good when you're done!",1155945600,6,295,4.584905660377358
1978472,4,B00018WNH4,"In disk one, Seane Corn teaches in a simple stage alone with beautiful muted music. Some have complained she talks too much, but it's all about the pose, getting in/out, what to watch out for, how to place all body parts (I learned new info even after 4 years & 30 yoga dvds.) Her speaking wasn't hurried or stressed in my opinion at all. She just sounds earnest in wanting to help others do it correctly to avoid injury & also so they don't give up due to not understanding. I think with all her info it helped me to be more present & not let my mind wander to daily worries becasue I breathed the most deep I'd ever done during a yoga workout & even the most deep even when I am trying to breathe deeply. I do like when the yoga teacher speaks since it reminds me to be aware of where my body is & what I am doing.
I just wished there was more then just teaching sun salutations of plank, lunges, upward dog, cobra, downward dog; triangle, side angle, warrior 1 & 2, child's pose, twisted triangle, butterfly, bridge, seated leg stretching, etc.
Disk 2 has her doing a routine w/the poses you learned, but you can only hear her breath. It's great for keeping rhythm, but it's hard w/o a good voice-over of her telling you what pose to do & maybe quick telling you when to get in/out of it.

They do have lots of guidance and tips so it is nice to watch but I really wanted something to practice to. I ended up selling them to someone who will hopefully make better use of them!!",1149811200,7,360,4.013888888888889
1978474,5,B00018WNH4,"If you are just getting started with yoga, or are interested in getting started with yoga, then START HERE!!!  This is the absolute best dvd to introduce yourself to yoga.  Unlike just about every other instructor on a yoga dvd Ms. Corn does her instruction just a little bit different.  Instead of just doing the routine and then narrating, Ms. Corn is actually talking you through the whole thing while she does it.  This is especially good because she strongly emphasizes proper alignment whether it is the placement and angle of the feet or how your body is supposed to feel or how it is supposed to be turned while doing an asana (pose).  Although I have since passed this dvd on to my father I still like to use the second dvd in the series every now and then to remind myself of how I am supposed to be aligned when doing certain poses.  Also, instead of going for a lot of fluff with the background Ms. Corn takes a minimalist approach to her dvds.  There is no expensive set in the background, just Ms. Corn in a black outfit and a black background.  Her dvds are wonderfully instructional and I can't wait for her to come out with the next dvd in this series.  Hopefully she will stick with the same style of doing things in the next dvd.  On a different note, if you are starting yoga, and you do find this dvd to be too difficult for you to do, then I would suggest the ""Yoga for Dummies"" dvds.  These dvds would be a good predecessor to this one only if you need it.",1148083200,5,1479,4.284172661870503
1978475,5,B00018WNH4,"If you want a DVD to play when you have to miss your gym or studio class, this one will improve your form before the next class. Although, or maybe because, she is based in Southern California, Seane presents a simple, friendly session without an exotic backdrop and distracting technopop or chants. She means it when she says that you can benefit from her instruction in your current condition. You're challenged to try your best but also to stay comfortable. You get a balanced, invigorating workout. Unlike most yoga teachers she does not command you to ever look up at the ceiling. This way you are always aware of your body's sensations instead of the track lighting and bend in your neck. I prefer her session with vocal commands because it's hard to look behind me at the screen for the silent instructions when the movements are reversed. But to be fair, this can be a problem with other videos and live classes. I also suspect that after repeatedly performing the movements taught in the audio DVD, you develop an subconscious rhythm that can guide you through  the non-verbal class. Your breath is key to this vinyasa flow. However, I have an instructor who discourages students from anticipating movements and breezing through in autopilot. That goes against the principal of being aware in the moment. After enjoying Seane's DVD, my response would be that the fundamental sun salutation itself unfolds in a routine manner. When you don't have to think about a surpise, you can really focus on nurturing your body and spirit by paying attention to every detail of a conventional pose.",1147392000,3,1595,4.842490842490842

However, I'm no longer a beginner anymore and tried to do the other disc which is included and I found it very difficult simply because she doesn't say one word, so you never know when to change poses.

I would recommend this for beginners to yoga because her instruction on proper alignment is quite good.  I find that the asanas she chooses are not very challenging and do not flow well, and she either talks way too much (regular session) or not at all (breath session; don't do it unless you either memorize it first or don't mind constantly glancing up to see what she's doing, taking the focus off your practice).",1142035200,4,577,4.702970297029703

Seane Corn does an outstanding job instructing and her philosophy and articualtion are beautiful - this makes it perfect for a beginner.  I'm not quite sure what to do with the second DVD that is just Seane doing a complete vinyasa without ANY instuction or cues. This would be great if I had the sequence memorized so I could follow her without having to look at what she's doing or going to do next, but then again, I might as well just do my own in that case.  Some simple sequence cues would be nice. All in all, it is a well done, very strategically taught beginner's vinyasa video.

The sun salutations are heavily modified in order to be attainable to beginners, but Seane's instruction is engaging and she explains the poses in excellent detail. Probably not the best DVD to purchase if you're interested primarily in relaxation, but if you want to learn to use yoga as a true workout, this is a great building block!",1138665600,9,431,4.684210526315789
1978503,5,B00018WNH4,"I'm very pleased with this video. I learned all these poses 20 years ago when I was young and flexible. Now that I'm older, not as fit, and relatively inflexible, I gravitate to floor/relaxing yoga poses when guiding my own workout. I needed a workout that got me to do the strength moves I know I should do (sun salutation, warrior, triangle, downward dog) but find difficult now. Seane is fantastic on form, and I feel confident I'm doing the moves correctly, within my fitness range. Some have called her ""chatty,"" but that's because she's got a lot of information to convey about how to do the pose correctly.

I must say I have not used the second disc yet, which many people criticize. I thought the idea was to be very familiar with the first disc before using the second one; to have basically memorized the routine and have the video on only for a bare reference and the music. I do agree it's uncomfortable and not good form to have to twist your neck to look at the TV in certain poses -- but really, you could say that about any yoga video, right? I suppose people might be right that a verbal cue for the next pose would have been helpful.

The instructional DVD is much too instructional to be interesting.  I know how to do a down dog already and don't need to do all of this so slowly. I wanted an actual workout, a flow.  So I went to the second DVD.

The second DVD, the workout, has no verbal cues.  How can I do this without verbal cues?  It's hard enough with the DVDs that cue strangely or with instructors that try to talk to you while they practice and you can't hear them, but this one gives you nothing, but a neckache as you try to see what's happening.  What a BAD idea!  If she at least did a voiceover to tell you the next pose it would help (the overly verbose like Kest can get annoying so I'm not advocating chit chat).  It's too bad because it looks like a good workout, if I could do it.  What a waste of money.  I gave two stars because I think the detailed instruction DVD could be helpful for beginners.",1136937600,11,1037,4.13

There definitely are no surprises to the routine, which places its foundation on basic Sun Salutation and Down Dog movements.  The flow of this DVD is consistent and each posture flows very naturally into the next, nothing feels unnatural or overstraining.  Corn is one of the best when it comes to good flow and breathing.  My only complaint, as it was in her first DVD, the actual 60-minute ""breathing session"" workout has no verbal cues, just the sound of Corn breathing. Beginners especially will find that somewhat irratating, because they will have to keep looking up at the screen to see what to do next.  Seasoned yoga practitioners, though, will adapt to non-verbal cues more easily after a couple of sessions.",1119657600,8,805,4.889705882352941

For me, it provided an introduction to modified sun salutes sufficient to allow me to begin to follow more advanced DVDs, and even now that I know the sun salutes well, it provides very good reminders on important points of aligment and useful modifications for some of the more difficult poses.

The second DVD IMO was intended for use as background music with a breath-rhythym marker.  You aren't meant to be cued by it, although a minimally cued version would have been useful.  I don't agree with those who find the inclusion of this second DVD to ""undo"" the usefulness of the primary workout.  The first DVD is gone through at a pace suitable for guided practice. The second is there for those who want to do their own practice.  The visuals might as well not be there, but that's OK.

My personal approach to yoga is more physical and less spiritual than some... I find Seane's extensive verbal near-prayer a bit discomfiting, but otherwise I find this an excellant practice to return to over and over",1119312000,12,1103,4.773684210526316

The problem is when you move onto the second DVD which offer the full series and flow from one position to next.  There is no verbal cue or voice-over to guide you.  It's simply Sean moving through the sequence silently.  In order to follow her you have to constantly look up at the screen.

It had none of the lush backgrounds that I've come to expect from Gaiam.  It was set at such a basic level that she couldn't even say modified sun salutations with a straight face.  That is absolutely true because it was so darn modified that I didn't even recognize them as Sun Salutations.

I didn't even break a sweat.  That's now what I do when I do vinyasa yoga.

What's with the breathing exercise.  No instructions.  You're suopposed to get into a pose and WATCH to see what she does next.  I'm a visual learner, but this borders on the absurd.  You have to get into a posistion and crane your neck to see the next pose. Dangerous IMO.

It's not practical to keep your eyes on the screen while doing poses, it almost seems anti-yoga. Why would anyone do this?

It is pretty to watch but impossible to follow unless you keep looking at the screen.  Unless you stare at the screen you are bound to miss some of her transitions from one move to the next. A quick ""naming the pose"" would have been very helpful.  I have been practicing Yoga for about eight years now.  I am a very physical person who likes an aerobic flow to Yoga.

It's great for beginners and really shows Seane's deep dedication to this practice,  but it does not challenge intermediate level students that are looking to go deeper into advanced yoga asanas.

Seane, when will you come out with an advanced DVD?

If you're looking for an evigorating Vinyasa routine, try Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti.""  It really develops upper body strength and deep flexibility.  I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to strengthen their practice.",1106784000,9,710,5.068965517241379
1978533,5,B00018WNH4,"If you are serious about Yoga, a Seane Corn workout will probably find you. They do say that when you are ready to learn, a teacher will appear. Seane Corn takes Yoga to a deeper level as she focuses more deeply on the entire yoga experience. She emphasizes the link between the breath and body. In the past few months, I've been finding that breathing is essential for deeper stretching.

Seane Corn is one of the most sought after yoga instructors. If you are interested in a one-on-one lesson, Vinyasa Flow Yoga is a highly-guided workout with calming music. Seane's instruction style is slightly more intense and much more serious than I am used to, but by the end of the DVD I felt amazingly calm, stronger and at peace.

Seane Corn's seriousness may come from her view that yoga is a divine ritual. You can really create a little heaven on earth through breath and movement. She takes yoga to a deeper level through integrating the breath with movement. The poses are not complicated and I recognized most of the classic routines:

Sun Salutations

Standing Poses

Twists

Meditation

Relaxation

Vinyasa Breathing techniques

After doing this workout I could not decide if this was for beginners, intermediate or advanced. In fact, it might just be for all three. While beginners are just learning the poses, Seane moves slowly enough to allow for this aspect. Intermediate yogis will enjoy the relaxing pace and detailed instruction. Anyone who is at the advanced level will more than likely enjoy the additional spiritual aspects (brief prayer and affirmations) and length (72 minutes) of the practice. The unscripted format is also quite refreshing. You feel like you are in a yoga class.

If you enjoy an ancient, flowing style of yoga, this might be for you. While this starts off fairly slowly, the continued practice and movements from the floor to standing will give you a spiritually healing experience. You will feel increased blood flow and as you work with your breath, your entire body will thank you for the experience.

I could also see Seane Corn making a breathtakingly beautiful outdoor workout. I hope she will move into the light (outdoors) because this workout can at times be a bit shadowy in places. While it gives this workout a lot of classic style, I am imagining the sun glinting off Seane Corn's hair out in nature. I love outdoor yoga workouts.

I do not consider myself a beginner anymore but feel challenged enough by the sessions to continue to use it frequently. Ms. Corn has the ability to be both soothing and encouraging throughout the sessions and I would gladly look for her future DVDs and would seek her out for classes if that were possible. The DVDs will have to do for now! She is the kind of yoga teacher that most of us search lifetimes for...,1104796800,4,554,4.336538461538462

1978570,4,B00018WNH4,"What a marvelous yoga practice from Seane Corn! I did the 1st DVD and felt as though I left a one-on-one instructional yoga class.  I have rarely felt that way with any yoga videos I have done (except maybe Bryan Kest's original Power Yoga series).  A very powerful yoga session.  As a comment to those that say this is for beginner's, I've been practicing yoga (Iyengar, Power, and Hatha/vinyasa) since 1998- so I'm not a beginner but still found the instruction valuable.  Seane is obviously a rare and thorough yoga teacher.

The 2nd DVD left much to be desired- I intend on following the 1st DVD for awhile before embarking on the 2nd session.  No verbal cueing was not a practical idea, even though I believe she intended for the viewer to manage their own home practice.  Hopefully, that will help me with the 2nd DVD.

I just want to know, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE WORKOUT PORTION OF THE DVD (DVD#2)??? There is absolutely no voice or voice over and you have to keep your eyes glued on the TV the whole time!!! I really would like to know how you're supposed to meditate with your eyes closed, do downward dogs and child's poses while you have your face glued to the TV. This is a ridiculous and amateur mistake and anyone who buys this should be refunded their money. It's a darned shame. I feel truly ripped off.",1104624000,9,691,4.323076923076923
1978572,4,B00018WNH4,"I really enjoyed Seane's inspiration and thorough instruction... however, I was looking for something a little different. What's most important to know about this DVD is: Seane painstakingly talks through each pose, which can be very helpful, but she is obviously addressing one with little experience. Or she's just going at a very slow pace. Because of this, the session ends up being very long and I could see myself losing interest after a few runs. I was looking for a shorter routine that I could easily follow along with and use perhaps daily to jump start my day. I wish I would have know more about the format b/c I probably wouldn't have ordered it since I am an intermediate yoga student. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice yoga DVD with great instruction for beginners. Seane is great, she's the kind of yoga teacher you'd want in class.",1104624000,2,849,4.629139072847682
1978573,2,B00018WNH4,"While I enjoyed Seane's instructional DVD (part 1), the second DVD was ridiculous.  I understand the appeal of a lack of verbal instruction, but this was lacking cues, as well (i.e., ""dog pose, upward facing dog""...etc) so you have to keep your head turned the whole time to see what she is doing!  It is impossible to fully embrace a pose when your head is turned to see what is happening next.  That was a huge mistake to leave out the cues.

Anyone into energy will like this. Seane is so soothing and vibrant with positive energy. I found it easy to stay grounded and in a wonderful mood all day after this. I didn't feel too worked out, but my back feels longer and straighter and my posture is better--after only two sessions!

I highly recommend this DVD because of the emphasis Sean puts on breath as well as movement. To all of the people who are reviewing this DVD and complaining about it being boring and too beginner, well, I think all of you need to ask yourself what exactly it is you're trying to get out of yoga, because if you are simply after the physical workout I think maybe you should be going to the gym instead. Your practice is what you make it; you should be able to go to any level yoga class or practice with any level of DVD and get an appropriate experience.

The second DVD is Seane performing her routine to music. There's no speaking, so if you want to follow along you have to constantly look up at the screen. There are no queues when she changes poses, not even an option in the DVD menus to turn on queues.

Unless you want to just sit and watch Seane's performance it doesn't lend it's self to following along. I like yoga practices that help you through the practice and focus on looking within. The person who made the comment about going to the gym is missing the boat. I am not looking for a sweat and burn yoga workout, I would just hope there would be some kind of queueing.

I would recommend Yoga for Urban Living as the best yoga DVD for your money. It is an insightful and well directed practice.

There are basically two DVD's that are included; one that instructs and the second that just has breathing.  The instructional was very technical good for when you are just beginning her routine.  The ""just breathing"" DVD was a bit disappointing because I never knew when she tranisitioned from one pose to the next....a bit of voice queing would be helpful for the future.",1100563200,2,536,4.731182795698925

I guess it would be okay for beginners who want a hardcore breakdown of EVERYTHING, but for someone who has been practicing for a few years, this DVD isn't anything special.  I wish she would've added a more advanced workout on the DVD as well.

I guess I agree with the other reviewers who stated their frustration at having to turn their heads to look at the screen for the advanced version. And the basic part too slow and a little boring.

I felt there was nothing new here and no chaptering?

1978618,5,B00018WNH4,This is an excellent beginner and intermediate tape as beginners will feel they are getting one on one instruction and intermediates will fine tune their posture. This is by far the most precise and technical instruction I have seen. I wonder though if after I know the routine by heart if the constant instruction will become somewhat distracting. Once I have this one down pat I would definitely look forward to Seane doing a more intermediate video with a little less technical instruction and Perhaps her doing the routine without speaking but hearing her voice in the backround guiding you into the poses and breaths. I definitely loved how it was just her and no class. All in all I loved her! She is defintely inspiring!!!,1091923200,,729,4.7936507936507935

1978620,5,B00018WNH4,"Even though Seane is one of these perfect picturesque yogis who grace the cover of yoga media from time to time, she favors breath and proper alignment to pretzel-like asana and unnecessarily extreme poses.  Her use of props (though not relevant to every one of my poses) helped breathe new life into the asanas that I have difficulty with.  What I really enjoyed about this video is that I learned new things (be it a technique, adjustment, or prop-use) about the most basic asanas in my routine.  I don't know if this new structure will help me to eventually touch my head to the ground in prasarita padottanasana, but I certainly feel more connected to the poses than before.  And for me, that is what matters.
I found the interviews with Seane very intriguing.  She is more than just another pretty yogini, and her opinions on yoga give an intellectual depth to her asana teachings.
I'd recommend this video to anyone starting out with yoga, who wants a proper foundation in which to achieve some of the real benefits of the practice (which putting your leg behind your head is not one of them).  I have since bought this DVD for my Mom (who has been practicing yoga via videotape for five years), and she said that Seane's instruction has helped transform her practice into something much more powerful and meaningful than what she was doing before.  If you are looking for instruction in yoga and are new to the practice, or feel that your intermediate practice needs refinement, Seane's DVD is the one to get.",1085356800,202,1516,4.676691729323308
1978621,5,B00018WNH4,"I have been seeing Seane Corn in many Yoga related venues for quite a while now, from being one of the ""students"" in Bryan Kest's Energy/Tone/Sweat videos as well seeing her many times in Yoga Journal Magazine. She is definitely very well known in the Yoga world. So when I heard she had a program out I was very curious to see what she had come up with.
 For the sake of background, I have been doing Yoga daily for close to 8 years now, study regularly with an amazing teacher and have over 70 yoga videos (I've stopped counting). So I'm a confirmed Yogaholic/Yoga Video Junkie with a practice that is primarily Vinyasa based.
 I would have to say that this program by Seane Corn is as good as it gets!
 THE TEACHER: Seane Corn is obviously very knowledgeable about Yoga and eclectic in the sense that she incorporates aspects of vinyasa with an excellent knowledge of body mechanics and form while stressing the need for students to respect their own bodies and not to force them into poses. She really ""guides"" you into the poses rather than just saying ""line this up with that....."".
 She emits a true joyfulness as a teacher and stresses the inner part of yoga, she is a true yogini and her passion comes through brilliantly.
 I found her to be VERY easy to understand, her cues are excellent and she has a wonderful way of highlighting her points regarding the postures that I found to be very unique and easy to implement.
 Contrary to another reviewer who said that there were parts where you had to look at the screen to know what was going one, I never found this to be true, at least as far as the VHS version is concerned. Perhaps the DVD is somehow different, that I can't speak to.
 THE YOGA: This program builds from very simple to more complex in stages. I really love this approach because you are never suddenly thrust into a posture, you are always led to it in a way that builds in increments. Not only does this make it easy to progress, but it works to keep the practice safe and very sound.
 I would say this is a program that complete beginners could easily follow, while someone who is much more advanced can use this practice as a more gentle practice to use on ""lighter"" days.
  I also feel that a more experienced yogi/yogini could certainly get new perspectives on familiar postures since Seane explains many things in a way I've never heard before.
 The sequence of asanas is also very thorough and works through a full range of movements so you will feel very balanced at the end. She ends with seated meditation and a guided relaxation.
 OTHER STUFF: This program is a little over an hour long so this is one you'll need some time for. If you need some shorter programs, Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Beginners Series is excellent for this  the consist of the sub-titles :Flexibility, Stamina, Strength (though the ""Strength"" program is more intermediate in terms of difficulty) as well as Baron Baptiste's ""Unlocking Athletic Power"" and ""Core Power"" live videos. Rainbeau Mars ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"" from her Sacred Yoga Set are also excellent and about 30 or 35 minutes long).
 Anyway, I would HIGHLY recommend this program for anyone who wants a flowing but mostly gentle practice from a teacher who I found to be really inspiring and I'm looking forward to other programs she comes out with.
 I'd love to see what she might do with a program at the next level of intensity :)

As a novice to Vinyasa Flow yoga I was inspired by her excellent cueing and precision on the first DVD (I even bought blocks).  However, the second DVD had me looking up her contact information to inquire how she expects practitioners to follow her without verbal instruction.

8008098,5,B00018WNH4,"I think there are a lot of misconceptions about this 2 disc set so I wanted to offer my own perspective in case it helps.  First, while I think Seane Corn is one of, if not THE best, physical instructors out there I am not a huge fan of the way she teaches.  No offense to her at all, she's amazing, but something about her voice just builds tension in my body.  That being said, you cannot ask for a better example of form and function to learn how to not only do the postures safely but to move into and out of them with mindfulness and awareness, which is something a lot of new or distracted practitioners and teachers take for granted.

This set consists of one disc wherein Seane conducts a workshop, not a follow-along class, on basic postures and for anyone who thinks they are beyond this or what she has to say, they're wrong. No one is beyond fine tuning form, ever, period. If you think these are ""too easy"" I feel you're missing the point.  This is something wonderful to use as if you were having a one-on-one session with her to really go over those seemingly small details which can change your experience of a posture completely. For anyone who ever noticed the way cobra pose shifted dramatically just from a mindful torso tilt, or who found new openness in triangle by lifting the chest ever-so-slightly, you know what I mean.  That is what the first disc is for and it's really valuable in that respect.

The second disc surprised me and lost some folks, because there is no dialogue or speaking whatsoever.  You watch Seane go through a very slow, methodical, safe and relaxing vinyasa flow set to gorgeous, hypnotic music with the sound of her synchronized breathing in the background. Watch it through one time, it's mesmerizing. Yes, it's a bit more challenging to follow along the first few times because of the lack of verbal cues but frankly the point is to flow in rhythm with your own breath, so you don't need to mirror and match what she is doing.  If you approach this as a deeply meditative and freeing practice, in an almost Mysore Ashtanga style where you can follow along but not worry about whether you are always doing exactly what she is, then you will likely find this to be as delicious as I do.  If you really need someone to tell you exactly what to do and when, which is also useful, you can still enjoy this flow but it will take patience and time, two things a lot of people seem unwilling to invest in their practice.  That's a shame, because this is about the journey and learning the flow and rhythm here is its own reward.

In the second disc she does things in a very modified approachable way, to be accessible to even an absolute beginner, but if you are a more experienced practitioner of course you can modify.  The point here is to find your own flow, following your own breath, not hers, so I don't see how any verbal cues would serve the purpose of this specific class.  She demonstrates, rather beautifully, a direction to move in and even if you are a step/posture or two behind hers it really doesn't matter.  Finding that sweet spot where the movement is following the breath, and not the other way around, as the breath remains calm and fluid is the point.  I find this deeply stirring and a really valuable tool despite having practiced yoga for 25 years.  I think if your expectations are clear and you are calm and open to this experience you will love this session as much as I do.",1436486400,4,3448,4.438985736925515
