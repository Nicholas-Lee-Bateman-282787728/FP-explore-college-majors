5261371,5,B0094GSRXS,"From the very first episode: Asylum of the Daleks to the mid season finale: The angels take Manhattan this series has been awesome!! Need I say anymore. I've been a fan of the series since the 60's with William Hartnell and I can truthfully say that the show has always been the best sci fi of all time.  The story of the Ponds and their adventure with the doctor will be one that fans will talk about for years to come.  After seeing each episode I feel that the writers did a good job of putting the cap on the series and the Ponds.  Highlights from the series would have to be the doctor taking on all the Daleks, the doctor taking on a cyborg robot in the west, and the statue of liberty** oops spoilers***  And with the 50th anniversery around the corner I feel that great things are in store for us doctor who fans.  Rumour has it that a couple of doctors from the past will be returning as it is rumoured that writer Stephan Moffet has had numerous meetings with David Tennant and Sylvester Mc Coy!!!!  And remember whatever you do don't blink... don't look away... buy this DVD... watch these episodes and don't BLINK!!!!",1349049600,25,1129,4.37799043062201
5261372,5,B0094GSRXS,"Prediction - ""Angels take Manhattan"" will take the Hugo Award for best SF show - a fantastic good-bye to the Ponds.",1348963200,3,115,4.523809523809524
5261373,2,B0094GSRXS,"I agree with reviewer Ian J. Withers. Series 6 was disappointing, and much different from the previous sets of series. In my opinion, there is much too much focus on the 3-4 main characters. In previous editions, there were some great storylines centered around new worlds and the types of people who lived there. I hope the series gets back to that direction. Cheers!",1347494400,4,368,4.765625
5261374,1,B0094GSRXS,"How does Debra know how the Ponds will leave for, as of today, only one episode of series 7 has been broadcast.  How does she know how mouths will be hanging open in shock?  How does she know how wonderful the 50th anniversary will be? Im not hopeful. The last series was so bad, I refused to buy the DVDs, having no desire to watch any episode again. And the sight of the Doctor riding a dinosaur on a spaceship (in the trailer) fills me with dread that season 7 will be more of the same -- getting sillier and sillier.",1346976000,7,520,4.138613861386139
5261375,5,B0094GSRXS,"like we all knew this first half of the series would be our farewell to Amy and Rory on the Tardis, and they could not have left in a more amazing way off screen than with the weeping angels. Steven Moffat is a genius when it comes to writing and no matter how many theories we put out on the story of how we think it all will end, Steven blows us out of the water every time with the unexpected and with our mouths hanging open in shock. Buy the series, it's well worth it whether it's the first series of Doctor Who you've watched or whether you started in the beginning or in the middle, wait till we see what Steven has for us in surprise for the 50th anniversary!

Information on what you're about to buy:

This Blu Ray or DVD set you are about to buy contains the first 5 episodes of the seventh series

episode 1: Asylum of the Daleks
episode 2: Dinosaurs on a Spaceship
episode 3: A Town Called Mercy
episode 4: The Power of Three
episode 5: The Angels Take Manhattan

*It will not contain any Doctor Who Confidential's as they have been cancelled since The Doctor The Widow and the Wardrobe. Whether it will contain a Pond Life i think is doubtful because it is listed as being 225 minutes long and that would not include those episodes.
* Most likely it will have NO SPECIAL FEATURES and if you want the features you will have to wait until the complete doctor who series 7 comes out which won't be until spring or early summer of 2013.
- personally i will be waiting to buy the series until it comes out with the complete series so i will have ALL the episodes, behind the scenes footage, monster files, video diary's and hopefully a special for Amy and Rory about their final days on set! If you can't wait then buy it, but don't get angry when you only have the episodes and only 5 of them with no features in fact you're better off getting it on iTunes just for the episodes you'll be saving around 6 dollars and still have the episodes in HD to stream to your TV or watch on the go from your computer or phone!

until next time...
GERONIMO!

my response to Ian J Withers:

how i know the ponds will leave is because it's been announced for many MONTHS NOW of their leave. how i know it's gonna be amazing? 1 it's doctor who, 2 it's steven moffat as the head writer, 3 when not are mouths hanging out in the amazing writing of doctor who, 4 damn right the 50th will be amazing! there is talk of having other doctor's return and old companions like perhaps rose or captain jack. doctor who is brilliant, scary, completely mad and yes silly at times that's what makes doctor who amazing and why us whovians adore it! anymore questions? BOOYA!

5261397,3,B0094GSRXS,When you buy Doctor Who seasons in two parts they omit the Christmas episodes which need then to be purchased separately.  The Christmas episode this season was an important part of the story arc for the season.  If you can wait it would be better to wait for the single boxed set full season which will include the Christmas episode and other extras they split seasons don't have.  I purchased the Christmas episode separately in standard definiton and BBC seems to have deliberately down graded the resolution to below that of ordinary DVDs quality.  I assume that they have done this so that people will buy the more expensive Blu-ray editions.  I have had other BBC series in standard definition that were almost as crystal clear as the Blu-ray; my reccomendation is that if you have a blu-ray player you'd be better off spending more for the blu-ray edition or buying the series via download.  That having been said the Blu-ray quality of this particular boxed set is excellent.,1403568000,2,983,4.78698224852071

5261413,3,B0094GSRXS,"The episodes included in Part One continue to show Matt Smith's versatility in the role of the Doctor. I am giving the set a 3 star rating because I purchased the series in Parts One and Two as at the time the listing for the complete series showed no additional special features. Later, more special features were added to the complete series.

If you are only interested in the episodes themselves and not the special features, you would do fine with the individual parts. Note it does not include Doctor, Widow and Wardrobe or The Snowmen. You would have to purchase those separately but that is understandable as they are specials and not part of series 7. They are, however, included in the complete series.

I was disappointed at having spent more money to get less. (The price has since been reduced as well.)",1384387200,7,816,4.659722222222222

5261416,5,B0094GSRXS,The DR Who series is by far one of the best sci fi series to date. I do collect this series that started in 1963,1381968000,,112,3.52

5261422,3,B0094GSRXS,"I am so glad that Amy Pond is off the show.  That being said, Series Seven Part One was full of good episodes.  The series starts with Asylum of the Daleks and introduces us to Clara- the new companion in Series Seven Part Two.  It was a great episode.  The rest of Series Seven Part One is ok, a few mediocre episodes, but interesting.  The Angels Take Manhattan is a really good episode and a good ending to Amy Pond on Doctor Who, although I did think the way Rory was said goodbye too was crappy- although it fit with how the couple was portrayed throughout their time on Doctor Who- Amy was the most important and could do nothing wrong and Rory was just the boyfriend/husband who stood by and watched his girlfriend/wife flirt with another man and do whatever she wanted and be insignificant in the writer's eyes.  Even though most fans liked him a hundred times more than stupid Amy Pond.  Series Seven in general I think was a bit of a let down, the upside being that Part Two brings Clara and at least a handful of better episodes.",1378252800,,1040,4.357512953367876

5261426,3,B0094GSRXS,"Start w daleks was great. Middle eps were a bit boring, tho enjoyed seeing dr try to live like them briefly and see how they lived when not w him. Always cry at their last episode, so emotional and good.",1377993600,,203,4.1
5261427,4,B0094GSRXS,"Bought this along with Series 7, Part 2, ""The Snowmen,"" and ""The Doctor, The Widow, and the Wardrobe"" because I was sick and tired of waiting for the complete Series 7 set. Seriously, BBC Video, what took you so long?",1377302400,,217,4.45

5261431,3,B0094GSRXS,"Ok I have to admit that while I was watching this series I enjoyed it.  However I really don't appreciate the story lines.  They all tie together like a soap opera.  It was kind of cool in the Key to Time but I really just don't buy into it for this season.  It was kind of like watching wrestling.  I beat you, you beat me and then we go to the pay per view and the fans cough up money to see what happens.

The technical aspects are still incredible and the special effects are up to todays standards.  The acting is good as well.

Matt Smith is probably my favorite Doctor to date, but I never saw the old series. I'll be sad to see him go next season. As usual an exceptional series of stories and well done in all aspects. Sorry, no ""spoilers""!  I usually get the complete series box sets and I'm wondering if the half season sets are missing anything they contain?

You have to wait for them to ever bring out the second half of the season and one thing about it, when you start watching Dr. Who you don't want it to end.  This DVD leaves one wondering about what the Dr. is going to do after what happens in ""Angels in Manhattan."" With spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I can say that the last episode was a big surprise. I also notice that he is becoming a darker and possibly less gentler Dr. One also wonders if there is going to be another regeneration.  I don't this Dr. is as happy go lucky as he was earlier.

5261486,3,B0094GSRXS,"Granted, this is only the first part of the series, and there is no denying that the Doctor still has me in his grasp. It just seems that the first four episodes were more or less delays or build-ups to the fifth episode, in which (if you don't already know this, I guess you managed to miss the BBC's aggressive and somewhat annoying promotion of that particular plot point) Rory and Amy are lost to the Doctor forever. Also, I felt the humor that is so key to Matt Smith's Doctor was lagging in the first two episodes. Usually when this is the case, it is replaced by his ""dark side,"" in which he becomes an angry, unstoppable force. That didn't happen either.
  Let it be known, however, that these episodes are still quite entertaining, perhaps even more so to those who don't go into it with the baggage of enormous expectations, as I did. Tastes differ. To give you some idea of mine,. my favorite Matt Smith Who episode to-date is ""The Impossible Astronaut."" Nothing in this first part of the seventh series even approached the level of creepy terror exuded by The Silence.",1360195200,8,1080,4.533333333333333
5261487,5,B0094GSRXS,"This season is great so far! Matt Smith is at his best. Amy and Rory once again show why they can be listed among the show's best companions. Karen Gillian could have a show of her own, as Amy.  It is amazing how well she knows the Doctor and how she helps him. The departure episode for Amy and Rory is one of the most emotional for a companion in the show's history. If the second half is as good, it will be an amazing way to celebrate the show's fiftieth anniversary!",1360195200,,471,4.119565217391305

Picture - GREAT
Sound - GREAT
Extras - GOOD

The main reason I picked this up already was the price.  Had a sale on it that I couldn't pass up, and I wanted to re-watch some of the episodes.  Oh yeah, and we don't get BBC in HD here, so this is the only way I can watch the episode in Blu-Ray quality.
Sound and video quality are excellent, it's great to have the full episodes all in HD quality with no commericals.

There are extras on the disks, but they're very, very short.  I'm guessing that I'll eventually regret buying the half-season when the full Series Seven comes out with a disk full of extras.",1360195200,,757,4.222222222222222

There have been only five episodes this year. After a long break. Of my favorite show.

And yet it's so worth it, because Doctor Who has been the best show it can be.

The Moff's blockbuster approach to all of these stories has worked beautifully. Him, Chris Chibnall, and Toby Whithouse all did their all. They (spoilers) turned the Statue of Liberty into a Weeping Angel, gave us a couple million fistfuls of Daleks, sent the Doctor to a western town, and brought back the dinosaurs....on a spaceship!

This may be a short season, but it's one of the best ones ever.

5261540,5,B0094GSRXS,"For this series and...the awesome extras!
The series starts with a great episode (ohh,I  can't wait to see Jenna-Louise Coleman as a companion!): Asylum of the Daleks! this is as good as the Doctor gets!!! Serious fun, we are talking powerful script and acting to match the Davies era, Matt Smith takes center stage and faces up to the best performances of Eccleston or Tennant! Thank you for giving him the script! it was about time!
And how can you resist Dinosaurs on a Spaceship, loved Rupert Graves in Indy attire, please bring him back!!! ( in my wildest dreams we'll have a special Christmas episode with Sherlock too!!!)
I loved Amy and Rory but it feels like their stories should come to an end so we don't repeat the same mistakes ( Rose anyone?!). Enough of the domesticity, Amy was best in series 5 before she became a bickering wife! I'm getting the same tired feeling about River Song, the mess of The Wedding of River Song...
I have to agree with Mark that said The Angels Take Manhattan is totally lame! It's sad that the creator of the Angels keeps bringing them back and each time is a total disaster! As if the Angels episodes in season 5 were not bad enough,this time the sci-fi part is missing in action! A shame because I really loved seeing Manhattan featured again, and the Marlowe touches were really great...Blink was a strike of genius and it is so tight, it's perfect, impossible to imitate, so don't even try!
The companions are awesome, but let the Doctor show his brilliance, quiet, unpretentious episodes like The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People prove how dramatic these series can be without too many gimmicks!
Just great ideas and great acting!",1354492800,2,1680,4.656565656565657

5261545,3,B0094GSRXS,"The newest season of Doctor Who is pretty much like last season so I guess if you liked that one, you will like this one.  I watched the new season with great anticipation, hoping they would improve the faults over the last season.  They did not however.  The stories are okay to watch the first time but the plots are so thin that they are not really re-watchable.  I would not bother to purchase the DVD set but just watch them on-line as I doubt you will want to see them again.  The stories this season seem to go in for a lot more humor and a joke is never as funny the second time you hear it.  I was also disappointed that they found it necessary to insert a pro-homosexual line into every story.  It was quite clear what agenda they were trying to promote here.
The classic doctor who stories may look cheesy and out-of-date but give me those over these for actual plot-lines any day.",1352073600,6,892,4.273809523809524

Dinosaurs was ok, but some extraneous charters like Nefertiti and the hunter were diverting from the main story. Brian was great !
Mercy was excellent. The ""Doctor"" did what needed to be done. If you saw it you know which one i mean.
Power of 3 was too short. To have this great lead up to the climax only to be solved by the Doctor in 5 minutes was such a let down. Again a 2 parter was perhaps in order?
Lastly, Angels. The least you do when you lose a main character or 2 would have been to do a 2 parter. I was getting to the point of being totally annoyed by Amy anyway, but..... well  maybe 1 episode was enough to say....... there be spoilers here.",1350432000,2,768,4.12
5261547,4,B0094GSRXS,"During the inexorable charge towards the big 50, DOCTOR WHO Series 7 - Part One is that cool glass of water for those parched and impatient for this latest series to be collected on DVD. I won't knock them folks who require their Doctor Who fix soonest, but I think I'll wait for a more comprehensive set, pending bonus features. Besides, the offer of a mere five episodes leaves me shrugging.

Showrunner Steven Moffat's directive for Season 7 seems to call for stand-alone episodes with the added caveat that these episodes come off each like a blockbuster event and peppered with neat reveals and callback moments. The Doctor's progressively darker side is explored. A cause for concern is that, nowadays, he seems more open towards that last resort. One recurring theme seems to be his (systematic?) erasing of himself from existence, so effective that now River Song is no longer incarcerated because the person she once murdered no longer exists. Moffat does what he's best at, which is present scenes rife with misdirection even as he manipulate the viewer's emotions. The fellowship of Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill is very soon doomed, but until such time - until Episode 5 - these three still delight viewers with unique chemistry. I'll miss Rory and I'll especially miss Amelia Pond and her spark with Matt Smith. I thought Karen Gillan's tenure a brilliant one. And Darvill's Rory, who started out as a tertiary character, made the most dramatic, most unexpected jump in terms of character arc.

Not all five episodes are as equally strong, but it's not in me right now to point out the flaws. Me being pretty fed up with the Daleks, the opening episode is still notable for the news of Amy and Rory's impending divorce (see the mini-serial prequel ""Pond Life""), several Easter eggs regarding past Dalek episodes, and the surprise appearance of Jenna-Louise Coleman, she who's been tapped as the newest Companion. Except that she won't be introduced proper until the Christmas special, coming soon. But ""Parliament of Daleks"" exemplifies what I said about Moffat's knack for sneakily pulling strings. It worked on me, anyway, but I'm a sentimental sap. I also quite enjoyed the episode's zombie undertones.

Honestly, one can't help but thrill to the title of the second ep: ""Dinosaurs on a Space Ship."" It just brings up all sorts of cool imagery. In this one, the Doctor decides to form a gang and so invites Queen Nefertiti, some obscure big game hunter, and the Ponds (and, inadvertently, Rory's da). They board a vast but deserted space vessel which is on a collision course towards Earth. Attempting to avert disaster, the Doctor and company clash with dinosaurs, a rapacious merchant, and a pair of ""metal tantrum machines"" that actually are two robot goons that, in their spare time, deliver some fairly amusing asides.

""Everyone who isn't an American... drop your guns."" That's maybe the best line in this ep. In ""A Town Called Mercy,"" it's a hoot watching the Doctor gussed up in a stetson and lankily out of place in the American Old West circa 1870. Except he, Amy, and Rory aren't the only persons out of time in the isolated frontier town of Mercy, beyond which town limits the residents are prevented from broaching by a deadly cyborg gunslinger. But here's the Doctor in a saloon, approaching the barkeep with his drink order: ""Tea, but the strong stuff. Leave the bag in."" Heh.

I love the concept of ""The Power of Three,"" with its time-spanning narrative and its choice of oblique menace (or as the Doctor calls it: ""...the invasion of the very small cubes""). Suddenly, all over the globe, little black boxes appear and pique everyone's interest. But as months elapse and the little black cubes remain innocuous, Earth's population gradually loses interest, takes them for granted, leaves the boxes be. Which is what the aliens have been waiting for. Now comes the countdown.

I really liked ""The Power of Three,"" not only for the little black box conceit but because the plot dictates that the Doctor stay over at the Ponds' residence as he keeps tabs on the mysterious cubes. This then gives us insight of what passes for normal life for the Ponds. Of course, the incessant waiting drives the Doctor batty. There are only so many household chores and activities he can do to stave off boredom. As a bonus, ""The Power of Three"" also features the Doctor's longtime ally, UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce), as well as one character who claims fond and familiar ties to the Doctor's past.

Some say that appearances by the Weeping Angels should be kept to a minimum lest that sense of menace evaporates. But not while Steven Moffat can pen such a good, atmospheric story about them. ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" is deliciously noir and gothic and heartbreaking and owns elements of time travel and meta-storytelling. New York City is ideal for a horror tale about the Weeping Angels, populated as it is with lurking, sinister statues. This is also the farewell episode for Amy and Rory, and it's a fine and tearful send-off. But now I'm here fidgeting over this current hiatus, anxious for the Christmas special. Time to move on. It's getting closer to 50.",1350259200,6,5210,4.866967305524239
5261548,5,B0094GSRXS,"What amazing episodes make up Part 1 of Dr. Who Season 7. If you haven't heard the news or watched the fifth episode yet, then this will be a spoiler for you - the 5th episode is the last with Amy and Rory as the Doctor's companions. The 2012 Christmas special will introduce the new companion (more on that later). Part 2 of Season 7 will air in spring 2013.

Last year, I waited until the combined Part 1 & Part 2 DVD set of Series 6 was available, instead of buying the two Parts separately. This year, though, I'm buying them separately. The amazon price for Part 1 is low, and if pricing this year is the same as last year, it will save a dollars to do so even with also buying the Christmas special separately. I guess I'll have to see if its worth it.

Part 1, Season 7, November 2012 region 1 DVD release:
1.  ""Pond Life"" Billed as a prequel to Season 7, this has 5 parts, each only a minute long. Every month, the Doctor calls Amy and Rory, and leaves a message on their answering machine. He's having a lively time, because the TARDIS' Helmic Regulator is acting up, and he's having more trouble than usual getting to where he wants to go. Some consequences aren't so bad; the Doctor gets to meet Mata Hari, which leads him to muse, ""What an interesting woman."" Distractions aside, is the Doctor going to make it back to Earth? Earth at the correct time, that is?
2.  ""Asylum of the Daleks Prequel"" (3 minutes) The Doctor is trying to enjoy his pastry at a Paris cafe, when a purple-cloaked figure approaches him. Then the tearoom disappears, and the figure assures him, ""You were never in the tearoom."" Aha - the Doctor realizes that it is a psychic projection. But if he's not in Paris, where is he?  ""Name the planet!"" the voice insists. ""Skaro"", the Doctor whispers. And that's how episode 1 of season 7 starts. with the Doctor meeting Darla Von Karlsen on the derelict home planet of the Daleks.
3.  ""The Making of The Gunslinger"" (2 minute) Episode 3 of Season 7, ""A Town Called Mercy"", features a cyborg gunslinger. This special is like a video report by Dr. Kahler-Jex to the powers that be. He describes the plan and execution for creating the ultimate living weapon. His unrepentant narrative includes this presager to ""A Town Called Mercy"": ""A degree of duplicity was necessary to secure [the men's] participation. They were told they'd been selected for peace-keeping missions on off-world colonies.""
4.  ""The Science of Doctor Who"" (45 minutes) Commentary is included by scientists as well as fans, some of whom have shown up in other extras: Dallas Campbell (actor, screenwriter), Chloe Dykstra (actor), Maggie Aderin Pocock (space scientist), Michio Kaku (theoretical physicist), Steven Moffat (Show Runner, Doctor Who), Scott Adist (actor comedian), Jim Al Khalili (theoretical physicist), Alison Haislip (actress, G4 correspondent), Professor Chris Phillips (Imperial College, London), Godfrey (comedian), Kurt Braunohler (comedian), Professor Kevin Warwick (University of Reading). I love Moffat's job description.
The science is divided into several categories:
*The TARDIS: Spacecraft and Time Machine. Kaku explains, ""The phone booth is not the TARDIS at all. It is a door. On the other side of the door there can be an entire universe.""
*Invisibility: Is it Possible?
*Time Travel: Is it Possible? Ms. Pocock's explanation sounds logical, and also reminds me of the tesseract in ""A Wrinkle in Time"". However, traveling to the past is a horse of a different color than traveling to the future. Remember the butterfly effect of chaos theory.
*Regeneration,  *Aliens,  *Cyborgs,  *The Doctor's Gadgets: Sonic Screwdriver and K9,  *Human Cloning
5.  ""Doctor Who at Comic Con"" (10 minutes) Matt Smith (the Doctor), Karen Gillan (Amy), Arthur Darvill (Rory), Caroline Skinner (co-executive producer) and Steven Moffat (Show Runner, co-executive producer, screenwriter), all took part in a panel in front of 5,000 people at the San Diego Comic Con 2012. (It doesn't actually state the year, but the host says that ""this year"" is the year we say goodbye to the Ponds.) This special has excerpts of the discussions. At one point, the host asks the panel what they would like to see in the show in the future, and Smith says he'd like to see something with Atlantis.

For this season, Dr. Who has gone to a short-movie format. This U.S. 2-disc DVD issue of Part 1 of Season 7 will be released November 2012. It has five episodes.

EPISODE SYNOPSIS:
1.  ""Asylum of the Daleks"" (one 50-minute episode) A woman in a monk's cowl is pacing in a ruined building. The Doctor walks in, not pleased, and tells her, ""I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages.""
She wants his help getting her daughter, Hannah, out of a Dalek prison camp. The Doctor's face changes and he says, ""It's a trap.""
""What is?"" she asks.
""You are. And you don't even know it.""
A blue-tipped eye-stalk comes out of her forehead. A weapon stalk comes out of her hand. She is a Dalek!
Cut to London where Amy and Rory have just signed the papers for a divorce. Then, to Amy's amazement, her hair stylist turns into a Dalek. Rory is captured, too. Our three heroes are taken before the Dalek Parliament, where the Doctor is given an interesting proposition. One he can't refuse.
As usual, the writing is excellent. The Doctor thought he couldn't be more disgusted with the Daleks than he already is, when he has an epiphany and speaks to the Supreme Dalek, ""You think hatred is beautiful!!""
The Supreme Dalek mutters back, ""Perhaps - that is why we have never been able to kill you.""
What a season opener! It has action, nano-particle clouds, Daleks revealed, and a poignant character in a big surprise.
2.  ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" (one 45 minute episode) The Doctor manages to pick up Queen Nefertiti from 1334 b.c.e Egypt - why, I don't know. From there, he goes to future Earth, and finds out a space ship is on collision-course with Earth. The ship ignores all hailing frequencies, and UNIT gives the Doctor 6 hours and 19 minutes to turn it off course. If the Doctor fails, Earth will send missiles to disintegrate the space ship. This sounds challenging and fun. The Doctor zips around and picks up John Riddell, a big game hunter, Rory and Amy, and, by accident, Rory's Dad, Brian, to help him and the Queen.
This is a story of ""piracy and genocide"", with tons of humor, too, including two robots who could be named Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Great dinosaurs. Remember the Silurians? They first appeared in the Pertwee years in ""Doctor Who and the Silurians"", but have lately made more appearances. They are also called Earth species Homo reptilia. What if they made an ark to allow dinosaurs to escape extinction?
3.  ""A Town Called Mercy"" (one 45-minute episode) A cyborg in a Stetson chases down a man in the desert. About to die, the man asks, ""Am I the last one?"" The cyborg aims his gun and says, ""There's one more. The Doctor.""
Cut to the Doctor, Rory and Amy standing in front of a Wild West gateway. They aren't supposed to be there. The Doctor promised them a vacation in Mexico. Oh well. The gateway sign reads, ""Mercy. 81 residents"". In front of it, surrounding the town, is a low wall with a ""Keep Out"" sign. Gleefully, the Doctor steps over the fence and Rory complains, ""The sign DOES say Keep Out."" Rubbing his hands together, a grin on his face, the Doctor assures Rory, ""I see 'Keep Out' signs as suggestions rather than orders. Like 'Dry Clean Only'.""
The townspeople aren't friendly to begin with, and when the Doctor introduces himself, they get really angry, pick him up and throw him back out over the low fence.
The sinister Gunslinger approaches, but the Sheriff, a decent man, rescues the Doctor. The Sheriff explains, the Gunslinger ""showed up 3 weeks back. We've been prisoners ever since.... Nothing gets ... in or out.... Pretty soon the whole town is going to starve to death.... He says he wants us to give him the alien doctor.""
You know it's not going to be a simple story, but it has a feel-good ending. Did you know the Doctor can speak Horse? This is the first American-style Western Dr. Who since the 1966 ""The Gunfighter"" with William Hartnell.
4.  ""The Power of Three"" (one 45-minute episode) Amy and Rory are having trouble choosing between Real Life and Doctor Life. Who wouldn't? Amy muses, ""Every time we flew away with the Doctor, we'd just become part of his life. But he never stood still long enough to become part of ours. Except once. The year of the slow invasion. The time the Doctor came to stay.""
Earth is blanketed by strange black cubes, maybe 4"" x 4"". The Doctor arrives because the cubes are certainly of alien origin, and must be an invasion requiring him to save Earth once again. But the cubes don't DO anything. For a whole year, the cubes don't do a thing, and the Doctor is going bonkers with boredom! Not even meeting the new head of UNIT, Kate Stewart, who shares his worry about the cubes, can keep him from boredom.
""When did you drop Lethbridge?"" the Doctor asks her.
Finally, a cube opens on one side and investigates the Doctor. He examines the cube, floating in front of him and says, ""Whatever you are, this planet, these people, are precious to me. And I will defend them to my last breath."" And then the cube tries to shoot him.
5.  ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" (one 45-minute episode) Someone is typing a story about a P.I., noire-style: ""New York. The city of a million stories. Half of them are true. The other half just haven't happened yet. 'Statues', the man said. 'Living statues that move in the dark.' ""
It's April 1938. The P.I. is Sam Garner, and he's been hired by Mr. Grayle to find out if statues can move. Grayle sends Garner to Winter Quay, an apartment building where he'll see the statues. Sometimes you want to shout at the screen, ""Don't go in there, you fool!""? This is one of those times. Garner goes into the hotel anyway, and finds a room with his name on it. There's an old man lying on the bed. Wait a minute, he looks familiar! The old man awakes and tells Garner, ""They're coming for you. They're going to send you back. In time. Back in time. I'm you!""
Cut to 2012 Central Park. Rory and Amy relax while the Doctor reads aloud from a 40's style novel by Melody Malone. Wait a minute - MELODY? Sure enough, things start to go desperately wrong.
The Weeping Angels are among the baddest bad guys ever imagined. When Rory is locked in a basement with a box of matches, you hold your breath. He lights a match. There doesn't seem to be much down there but a lot of putti cherubs. Cherubs... as in baby angels.
This is an awesome but confusing episode the first time through. I wish there had been more time to tell the story. The way Rory and Amelia Pond leave the Doctor is unexpected and creative.

CHRISTMAS SPECIAL:
(The Christmas special is not part of the DVD release of Part 1 of Season 7.)
The amazing Jenna Louise-Coleman will be the Doctor's new companion, meeting the Doctor in a Victorian Christmas 2012 Special. We saw her already, in episode 1, ""Asylum of the Daleks"", where she played Oswin Oswald. Steven Moffat, currently Dr. Who Lead Writer, says he chose Louise-Coleman as the new companion because ""she worked the best alongside Smith and could talk faster than him."" Now that's saying something.

Another fantastic set of episodes of the inimitable Dr. Who.

Happy Reader",1349481600,81,11608,4.730464886251236
5261549,5,B0094GSRXS,While there's a weak episode or 2 it's mostly a very enjoyable season. The final episode Angels Take Manhattan is HUGO worthy for sure. Just wish there'd been more episodes and I for one really miss the two parters like we had in the past two series. The Ponds are awesome and they really do have a terrific send off. I cried my eyes out. They've been top notch companions. I'm a big fan of Matt Smith's Doctor and I'm very pleased he's back!
