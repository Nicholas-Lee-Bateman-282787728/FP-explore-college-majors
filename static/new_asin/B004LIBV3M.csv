8434407,1,B004LIBV3M,"This DVD is stealing
I paid 69$ plus shipping
And I have received a DVD with stupid movement that is not worth the money at all
69) fir one tape to show you that just the preparation of it.
Ridiculous
This DVD is good for kindergarten kids",1484006400,,239,4.1063829787234045
8434408,5,B004LIBV3M,"This is one of the best exercise DVD's out there. Karina is a renowned dancer, but this DVD shows why she's also a renowned teacher. The instructions are so well explained that you won't have to be staring at the screen wondering what in the world you were just told to do!  If you follow this routine with regularity, you will get in fantastic shape in no time. Highly recommended.",1409702400,,382,4.457142857142857
8434409,5,B004LIBV3M,Karina is a great instructor. I would recommend this DVD to anybody who wanted to use it. . It is a great routine and she does it so nicely.,1406851200,,140,3.8620689655172415
8434410,4,B004LIBV3M,I like this DVD. It gives me the workout that I need to lose weight. It also gives me the opportunity to learn some of the moves to the ball room dances. It will certainly give you a workout.,1379203200,,191,3.923076923076923
8434411,3,B004LIBV3M,"Video was not bad but I thought I would see more dance moves, especially from a dancer like Karina Smirnoff...",1373500800,,110,4.55
8434412,5,B004LIBV3M,"I love karina, her dancing is awesome and she is the best female professional dance that i've seen on Dancing with the Stars. Her DVD was hard to follow in the beginning, well what do you expect, it's a dance inspired workout, and you just don't pick up dancing its something that you learn and it takes time. After the first use I could definitely feel every muscle in my body and that means it works. the only thing I don't like it the ""Arm Barrel's"" them things hurt but it works. i use the DVD twice a day and i see and feel the difference, and it gets better everytime. Its worth every penny.",1370649600,,597,4.2
8434413,4,B004LIBV3M,I like this video but if the other 2 dancers would have turned around so you could follow their steps if would be way more helpful.  You have to try and mirror their moves and if you are a beginner it is hard with some of the moves.,1334275200,2,232,3.8333333333333335
8434414,4,B004LIBV3M,"I love Karina!  She is a very well established and beautiful latin dancer.  I have all of her latin DVDs.  This DVD has clear instruction and explanation.  The first part is warm up, stretching, and toning.  I especially love her explanation on the jive portion of the workout toward the end of the DVD.  It's clear, and it made my heart pumping in no time.  I just wish it was longer for this price. I think Karina should have more DVDs!  :)",1323388800,19,442,4.304878048780488
