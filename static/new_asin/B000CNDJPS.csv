8099308,4,B000CNDJPS,I got this years ago when I needed something to recuperate from a bad back and my physio warned me away from yoga and urged me to try pilates. I appreciated the set up and explanation for the exercises. Especially the attention paid to breath which I utilized throughout my days. The set of exercises I found to be well rounded and I noticed very definite changes regarding strength and carriage. I'd totally recommend this to somebody who wants to make a start looking after their physical body.,1377907200,2,496,4.6477272727272725
