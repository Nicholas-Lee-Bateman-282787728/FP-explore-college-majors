DISC 1

1. STEPHAN BONNAR VS KYLE KINGSBURY-in the opening fight of the main card we got this fight right here. The first round is great as both guys set a great pace and go straight at it. Both guys get nailed by some big punches and knees. As the round comes to a close Bonnar is on top after a takedown securing the round.  The second round is all Bonnar as he gets the early takedown and stays on top for the remainder. The final round is just as dominate for Bonnar as he gets on top and keeps Kyle there, he gets the UD.

2. MARTAIN KAMPMANN VS RICK STORY-this was a fight I was excited about based on these two guys and their styles. The first round was just what I expected with both guys landed big and coming right at each other. They both do well in the second landing on each other a few more times but it is Kampmann that takes the round after a nice trip. He then continues to work for the arm-triangle from there. The third round would see a few good knees and strikes but it was mostly spent in the clinch. There were a few takedowns but Kampmann taking Storys back at the end is what sealed the split decision for him.

3. URIJAHFABER VS BRIAN BOWLES-the first round in this one sees them exchange a few times but it is Faber that controls the pace and octagon. Towards the end of round Faber secures it with a takedown. The second round sees Faber start out strong landing a big uppercut and then drops Brian. From there he lands huge elbows and sets up a guillotine choke. Brian has to tap as it is deep and Faber rolls it into mount.

4. WANDERLEI SILVA VS CUNG LE-this was one of the fights I was looking forward to the most, in fact this and the next were two of the most anticipated matches ever for me. This fight pit two of the greatest strikers of all time against each other Cung Le is one of the best kickers in MMA history and Silva is a straight up killer the first round is excellent with Le showcasing those amazing kicks. He lands a huge spinning back fist that drops Wanderlei. They both land some many shots in this round with Cung controlling the center of the cage. But towards the end of the round Silva cuts Le with a straight right and starts to unload on him. The second round was just as great but this time around Wanderlei was a little more in control as Cung was slowing down. Towards the end of this round Wanderlei just lets loose with some deadly kicks and punches that rock Le. From there Wanderlei delivers some of the most vicious knees I have ever seen, he follows those up with a really stiff jab that sends Le back. He then proceeds to latch on the Thai clinch and lands another big knee. Cung shoots in desperately but is met with some hammer fists, the ref saves him from there and Wanderlei gets the big win. Cung went home that night with his face literally smashed as his nose was pushed to one side of his face, it looked nasty.

5. DAN HENDERSON VS MAURICIO RUA-one of the biggest fights that should have happened in Pride FC finally happened here. This fight would end up being the most dramatic fight I have ever seen and honestly it may very well be the greatest fight of all time. This was the second non title five round main event in UFC history and what a great one it was. We get a great opening round as these warriors go straight at it. Dan strikes first landing a big right hand followed by a close choke attempt. From there he unloads land as Shogun is against the cage. Late in the round Shogun catches Dan but Dan wins the round in my opinion. The second round is just as great with Dan landing a huge right hand followed by a killer uppercut that sends Shoguns head popping up. But it is not enough and both men continue to do battle with Dan taking the round once again. The third round is one of the most dramatic as Dan lands an insane right hand that would have knocked anyone else out. From there he lands some shots that I am not kidding in saying would have KILLED lesser men. But Shogun fights through it and even goes for a leg lock and makes it to the end of the round with Dan taking it. This next round gives me goose bumps as it is so back and forth. Shogun lands a huge uppercut early and gets Dan down only for Dan to almost sink in a rear naked choke then the exchanges are amazing as one guy is landing huge only for the other to come back and land some of his own. In fact Henderson lands one of my favorite punches ever here. Then at the end of the round Rua gets the takedown and ends up in mount, Shogun with mount is death for anyone else. But here Henderson ends up reversing it and ending the round on top, it was insane but could have gone either way. The final epic round was all Shogun as he took Dan down and  got mount on Henderson countless times. Dan would not be finished though as he kept fighting through it, that is crazy since it was a man like Rua on top of him. In all honesty if either one of these warriors were facing someone else this night they both would have finished those guys. In the end Henderson got the UD here but this is actually one of those times were no one was a loser here.

This was an excellent card with great fights and actually the greatest fight of all time. It was so dramatic and if you know the history of these guys you know any other people would have been stopped by them.

DISC 2

1. DANNY CASTILLO VS SHAMAR BAILEY-this fight only lasts a round, and almost a full round at that. This fight is all Castillo as he got to takedowns including a huge slam. From there he stayed on top the entire time and landing some big shots with seconds left to finish Bailey for the TKO win.

2. SETH BACZYNSKI VS MATT BROWN-this was a grinding first round with Seth mostly in control. It was a good back and forth battle with each guy going for a sub. The second round ends rather quickly as Seth sinks in a very tight guillotine choke. Brown tries with all his heart to escape it but ends up tapping.

3. MIGUEL TORRES VS NICK PACE-we get a good first round here with Torres going for a kimura that is defended well by Pace. Good back and forth with Miguel edging it. The second round was closer with both guys doing a great job fending off the other. The final round was mostly Torres who landed a bit more. Torres gets the ID here with 30-27 on all three judges scorecards.

4. GLEISON TIBAU VS RAFEAL DOS ANJOS-really good first round as both guys came to fight with each landing. The round could have gone either way depending on how you looked at it. The second round looked much like the first until the end of the round when Tibau unloaded on Dos Anjos. Anjos was rocked but stayed on his feet even as the punches came. The third round is a little more clear as well with Tibau coming out on top and taking the SD.

5. CHRIS WIEDMAN VS TOM LAWLOR-this fight is pretty quick as it goes a little past two minutes with Chris choking Tom out and putting him to sleep. This was a good showing for the man that would end the reign of The Spider.

6. MICHAEL MCDONALD VS ALEX SOTO-this fight didn't even go past a minute as McDonald lands a killer right counter that drops Soto. He gets all over him from that and knocks him out cold moments later.

7. RYAN BADER VS JASON BRILLZ-this fight like the last two ends quickly and in the first. Bader knocks Brillz out with a glancing right hand. This was a good win for Bader over a tough guy.

This was a great night of fights and you get the behind the scenes and the countdown show as well as the weigh-ins as bonus features.",1383868800,,7516,4.164600550964187

8496185,5,B006BZ8O2E,"WOW!!! UFC 139 IS ONE FAVORITES, BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT CARD AND GREAT NAMES. MY FAVORITE FIGHTER IS WANDERLEI SILVA. AND HE PERFORMED.",1355270400,,135,4.666666666666667
8496186,5,B006BZ8O2E,"The Rua-Henderson fight is one of the greatest UFC fights ever, In my opinion I still think it was a draw. It's a must have DVD for UFC fans. With Faber, Kampmann, Bonner, Bader and Michael McDonald also on the card the DVD is very solid.",1345939200,,238,4.195652173913044
8496187,4,B006BZ8O2E,I don't agree with almost all fans that the Shogun vs Henderson main event was the greatest fight ever. It was a really good fight but not the greatest in my opinon. I also feel that Shogun got robbed again and deserved to win the decision on my scorecards. Overall it was a good card from top to bottom; but not a great card.,1338508800,2,326,4.109375
8496188,5,B006BZ8O2E,shogun vs henderson one of the best fights Ever.  Plus got to see Vintage W. Silva.  One of the best cards to date,1332460800,3,114,3.9130434782608696
8496189,5,B006BZ8O2E,"This was clearly one of the best events of the year. Plenty of good fight and a main event for the ages. Absolutely one of the best wars in the history of the sport. It was the right mix of blood, guts, heart and technique. Not a pure technical battle but not just a gassed out slopfest either.",1331683200,2,294,4.086206896551724
8496190,5,B006BZ8O2E,"UFC 139 has got to be one of the best events i have ever had the pleasure of watching, and i have been watching the sport for quite some time. A must have for hardcore fans or new fans of the fight game!

The one negative thing i noticed about the event were the fans in San Jose. I thought the fans would be a bit more appreciative of some of the action seeing as how it is the hometown of Strikeforce. At times the fans came off as completely unknowledgeable and ignorant. The boo's that could be heard in some of the earlier fights drove me crazy!!

Outside of that little complaint i thought the card was excellent, 5 stars!!",1328486400,4,629,4.190082644628099
8496191,5,B006BZ8O2E,"It was a good night for the UFC! Almost all the fights on the card had entertaining nonstop action! I would love to see a Shogun vs Hendo rematch! I still feel it was a draw. Shogun can definitely take a punch. If he's able to survive all those H-bombs from Hendo, I don't think anyone can KO him! Maybe a couple of head kicks in a row. This main event made me go and purchase some of Hendo's products afterwards. I was a fan of both these guys, but after this fight, I would consider them two of my favorites of all-time... among other fighters. I was disappointed with the Silva vs. Le match, but I guess I'm happy for Silva. Poor Le losing in his hometown. I don't think anyone from San Jose won that night.",1327104000,5,710,4.1521739130434785
8496192,5,B006BZ8O2E,"The preliminary matches were great... But what really caught my eye was the fact that my PRIDE LEGENDS were fighting. They haven't all been on the same card since Pride 33.

Wanderlei was on the chopping block, one more loss and he was done with the UFC. No one expected him to fight SMART against Cung Le. One kick from Le and it would have been over.  After dropping Wanderlei with a spinning back fist, Wanderlei got up quickly, dispelling the rumors about his faulty chin. During the second round Vintage Wanderlei Silva whips out his muay thai knees and breaks Cung's face it. The ref stopped the fight when it was obvious Cung Le was done. Joe Rogan at first did not like the stoppage, but later went on in his podcast about he realized Cung was finished, and that the ref had saved him.

Shogun vs Henderson should have happened 5 years ago, but wow, I never expected it to be this amazing 5 years later. Back and forth the fight went. It looked like Shogun was done in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd round, but he has such heart that he was able to dominate Dan in the 4th and 5th round. Both fighters were completely gassed, but they kept it coming. Blood was everywhere. Their shorts were Pink (originally white). It was the greatest fight in UFC history besides Chuck Liddell vs Wanderlei Silva at UFC 79. If you don't buy this dvd, then you are a fool. It is an amazing card and your lives will benefit by watching it.",1326585600,10,1420,4.350943396226415
