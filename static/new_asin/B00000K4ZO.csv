1243364,5,B00000K4ZO,"I've been looking for this movie for a long time, but didn't realize it was available, since it wasn't listed by the original title, Gadjo Dilo.  I only found it after seeing it in a video store with both titles, and  finally knew to search for it by the English title.
This is my wife's  all-time favorite movie.  My teenage daughter also fell in love with it.  Their comments echo those of the reviewer above.  I haven't seen it myself,  but am buying it on their very strong recommendation, since it's very hard  to find.",944956800,,524,4.442105263157894

I was so  touched by this film I knew I had to own it immediately. The soundtrack is  also amazing.

1243366,4,B00000K4ZO,"This movie pulls you in with the first scene as you see the crazy stranger right away. The music picks up as it make you want to pay attention without noticing what is really abut to happen. A young man named Stefan is the first person you see in the film, he is on a mission. A mission to find a singer that his father used to sing to him when he was little. HE finds himself in a small town of gypsies after a while when an older man named Isidor adopts him. He is then thrown into this culture and grows to love it and be a part of it. Even though the language barrier plays a big part they still communicate through the little bit of words and of course through the music.
Through the whole story we see that Setfane falls for one of the girl,named Sabina. She is not really part of the twon as she has been outcasted as the whore because she left her husband and returned to the town. This is why I feel like he related to her so much, he was also an outsider of the town. He did not belong just like she really didn't either.
This movie really opened my eyes to everything that really you don't get to hear about. The way these people were treated and how they were not allowed to even go to the hospital. I really enjoyed the movie, though the jokes, and the language they would use. These people are very open and it makes you think that everyone should somehow have their spirit.",1391299200,,1388,4.106617647058823
1243367,4,B00000K4ZO,"Gadjo Dilo was overall a treat to watch, a real much needed culture shock of an experience. In this story you follow a young man by the name of Stefan, who is on a quest to find a child singer whose voice he heard all his life in the country of Romania. Inspired by his fathers curiosity in a pursuit  to find cultural ties among the masses, mainly nomadic people. This tale begins when Stefan seemingly destitute and in need of a place to stay along his travels, is greeted by the loving, brash, no-filter having, drunk Father figure you only meet in stories such this, Isidor. On a cold night Stefan is too late to find lodging for the night and crosses path with Isidor, one thing leads to another, they drink, bond, and drink. This night is a precursor of things to come.
  Though there is a language barrier between Isidor, Romanian and Stefan French, they find a bond as Father and son they both never had metaphorically. The story carries along, pointing  out the cultural differences and similarities. Among the chaos and comedy a love story develops between Stefan and a gypsy woman named Sabina. Sabina though a gypsy that is accepted among the others to an outsider, shares the same interloper status as Stefan. Together along with Isidor they polarize the village with customs, love and cultural similarities.
  As I said before this is much watch. I think the comedic approach softened my thoughts on what I think is right because of my culture and just left me to sympathize with both sides of the fence. And it doesn't hurt that I'm a fan of absurdities and done right ""your mother wouldn't claim you"" jokes. Tony Gatlif, a gypsy himself gives us a autobiography without announcing it publicly. I'd definitely watch this movie again. Didn't wanna give away too much...I hope you enjoy the movie as I did.",1391212800,,1819,4.633540372670807
1243368,4,B00000K4ZO,"Gadjo Dilo or otherwise known in English as The Crazy Stranger is another great film by Tony Gatlif about the Roma diasporas. The film itself has a playful feel to it and is very informative about the Romani gypsy culture. The film tells the story of a young French student by the name of Stephane who travels to Romania to find a Gypsy singer by the name of Nora Luca whom his father, who was also a traveler, had loved and recorded during his travels. He runs into an older gentleman, a musician by the name of Izidor, who promises Stephane that he will bring him to Nora Luca. Izidor lives within the Romani village and decides to take in Stephane as his own and fully immerse him within the Romani culture to teach him the ways of the gypsies.
  This movie was a pleasure to watch considering the music was absolutely fantastic and the dialogue is hilarious. Considering only a few people in the movie are actually actors/actresses, this film is a real eye opener when it comes to the customs and traditions of the gypsy culture. Through Stephane, audiences are able to experience the culture of these people and internalize some of their values as he struggles to find himself as he searches his own human emotions, cultural differences and being able to understand the Romani people. Overall, this film is a breath of fresh air and I would recommend it to anyone looking to feel good afterwards and have a good laugh in between.",1391212800,,1434,4.575875486381323
1243369,3,B00000K4ZO,"I liked this movie when I first saw it. It doesn't look so good now and the story line is pretty thin, but the gypsy music, what there is of it, is good. There is not as much music as I remembered though.",1389225600,,204,3.7674418604651163

Thank god for Tony Gatliff, because he makes some great films about the Rom diaspora. The film is informative and playful, but the elements of tragedy are there from the beginning.  I get pissed every time I think of all the unacknowledged contributions of art and culture that the Rom have contributed to world culture.

Aside from all that Romaine and Rona and Isidore and the rest are nothing short of delightful.  I felt so bad about Adriani.",1375315200,,577,4.808080808080808

1243374,5,B00000K4ZO,"The film tells the story of a young French student who travels to Romania to find a Gypsy singer whom his father had loved and recorded in his own travels.  The French boy lands in a Gypsy village, hosted by an old man who is a musician and who promises to bring him to the singer the boy is looking for.  There is not a lot of complicated plot, but the charm of the film is seeing the culture.  Wow!  Visually and musically this is a feast.  I loved the costumes the women wore and had to wonder if they always dress that way....and where did they get these great fabrics?!  Then...there is the music.  It takes a while for the film to get into the music, but once they are invited to a wedding, you know you're on your way for a treat.

There's a nice romance involved, between the boy and one of the Gypsy girls who is a breath of fresh air to any tired old movie goer.  She sings, she dances, she flirts, she curses, she runs naked through the woods.  No wonder the French boy falls in love with her; who wouldn't?

The music and the open passion of the people is truly touching.  As difficult as their lives are, I envied them the freedom to express themselves as they do.  Howling at the death of a loved one, dancing at his grave, striking the ground with your fists....all seem more natural and much more preferable to me than the buttoned-up ways our culture marks such events.

Their colorful style of clothes, their music and occupations, and their old-fashioned close-knit family way of life are great. A lot of American modern families split up and go separate ways. But I cannot watch this with my family because of the nudity in a couple places and off-color language in some places. The scenery and the beautiful ladies are great though. I'll probably watch it again without the subtitles. I'd also recommend the film Latcho Drom, also directed by Tony Gatlif. A film filled with the Roma people and their music, from India to Spain.

In the process, St&eacute;phane meets and effectively joins a Roma family --- and falls hopelessly in love with a gorgeous woman.

Fiction or not, overall, the film reflects the genuine condition of the impoverished Rom people of Romania --- including their lifestyle, music and joi de vivre. It's a look at Romania's totally delightful (albeit simultaneously despised) Rom subculture.

Shot in the Romanian village of Cretulesti, the cast is largely composed of Rom people, some of them renowned musicians --- such as Izidor Serban, and his family Angela, Vasile and Ioan. Other great Rom talents are also included here. It's an all together fabulous creation.

The story ends quite tragically, and also in all likelihood doesn't differ greatly from the Rom reality in rural Romania.

The great irony, of course, as a viewer of this film, is that you yourself are just a passing voyeur who consumes a bit of Rom culture for as long as its on the screen...then you return to the life you actually have, wherever you are.

1243385,5,B00000K4ZO,"In an era when Hollywood has degenerated to the point of only being able to crank out such ""masterpieces"" as the Austin Powers series, ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""American Pie"", or recycling old ideas in new and even shoddier versions like ""Starsky & Hutch"" and ""Walking Tall"", it's reassuring to see that filmmakers outside the good ol' U.S. of A. can still manage to make films which deal with real human emotions rather than crass cynicism.
This movie focuses on the story of a young Frenchman who inherits an old casette tape that his anthropologist father once made of a traditional Gypsy singer. Seeing her voice as a link to his dead father and a channel for his grief, he sets off on an obsessive quest to far-flung Romania in search of the songstress.
Watching this movie which was shot entirely on location in the Romanian countryside, I was struck at how lucky we are these days, as until the end of the Cold War just a few years ago, an Algerian director shooting a film with a French actor in the wilds of Romania would have been a totally unimaginable thing. And it was a treat watching a film which is entirely in Romany (aka Gypsy) language, along with some French and Romanian.
In Romania, the youth goes to a Romany (Gypsy) village. But being unable to understand even a word of each other's language, the villagers have fun making sport of him by heaping him with obscenitites. But eventually he does make friends and gradually becomes drawn into the fabric of Romany daily life. Along the way, we the viewers also come to experience and understand the carefree and spirited zest for life that permeates Romany culture.
The film also includes a love story, but director Gatlif chooses to ultimately make his film a much larger commentary on the uncertain and difficult life for the minority Romany, given the ethnic tensions and discrimination they experience with the majority Romanians.
So if you're sick of Hollywood's version of ""Reality"" and would like a glimpse at a fresh and different perspective on the world, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.

Unfortunately this one has far less of the sublime music and tries to tell a story.  A young Parisian fellow travels to Romania to find a favorite Gypsy singer of his late father's.  He enters a Romany (Gypsy) village and is unable to leave, though I can't imagine why.  All the residents do is complain and curse in incredibly foul expletives.  Any child old enough to read should not be allowed to watch this endless barrage of foul profanity.  If a child is too young to read the subtitles then it would be ok since the dialogue is in Romanes, French, and Romanian.

Community was a theme throughout the film. The Roma people interact with each other throughout the film, in good times and bad. They rejoice when one of their people return home and mourn when he is killed. Music is involved in each of these situations. What was particularly noteworthy to me was how the Roma rejected someone who was not part of their group. The protagonist is clearly not a Gypsy. He is French and does not speak their language. They give him dirty looks and go as far as chasing him in one seen. For a people so free and warm in their own community, I would have thought they would have received a wanderer with open arms. I was able to conclude that Roma are not better than people who we consider to be civilized. They are not immune to human imperfection that causes us to judge people when we meet them. Ideally we would all treat people the way we want to be treated, but the Roma proved to be human in their rejection of the protagonist when he arrives. He, and his gypsy lover, seemed to be the moral cornerstone of the film which perhaps was an intentional tribute to the thought that love conquers all.",1392768000,,1287,4.4576271186440675

Who's to say that the story would never happen?  An elder, Izidor, of their community accepts this stranger therefore so does everyone else.

7914303,4,B00000K4ZO,"""The Crazy Stranger"" is a very informational film about the clash between the Roma culture verse the non-Roma people. The main character, Stephane, is a French man who is studying musicology and is embarking on a quest to meet Roma musician, Nora Luca. Now, it seems that the most accessible information about the Roma people is generally through their music. We can prove this by the already very popular ""gypsy"" bands that are know through out the world, such as DeVotchKa and Gogol Bordello. It's interesting to see how important music is embedded within this culture and how it's used to define them. This is presented within the film when a character in the movie dies. Instead of weeping by the grave, they play music, drink and dance around the grave to celebrate the person who has passed.
The importance of music is also present in Roma's daily activities. In the movie, the Roma play music for various celebrations such as a wedding and brings their music with them literally where ever they go. There was a ton of scenes in the movie in which the characters were in the car without listening to the radio and instead, singing their own music. It was really interesting to see how Stephane also adapted to the Roma culture by learning their music and craft.

The Crazy Stranger is a good example of a movie that is made respectfully, and with a lot of attention being payed to the accuracy of representation.
 Often times when a movie is made about a certain group of people, the director is not part of that group of people, and thusly the music might not be exactly representative of the people, and there might be stereotypes being acted out unknowingly. This is not the case in this film however.
 The characters are all represented in a way that makes it obvious that the director has a respect and understanding for who the Roma people really are. The music is a large part of the movie, as it is in many movies about the Roma people. Another thing that this film depicts well, is the treatment of the Roma people by Gadjos. Izidors son Adriani was imprisoned before the start of the film, for reasons that appear to be weak at best. After his release, he goes into town and stirs up trouble, only to be chased home, and pass away as his village is set on fire, and burned to the ground.",1391472000,,1231,4.3478260869565215
7914305,4,B00000K4ZO,"This film was a wonderful portrayal of Romany/Gypsy lifestyle and their exile. At first look I thought it was a documentary. Only until the wagon came and it was on board with the gypsies did I know it was a scripted film. The rawness of the characters, their lifestyle and how they reacted to this stranger was intoxicating; the old man in the beginning was excellent! And when he woke up and didn't even remember the encounter, I was sold from that moment on. You can tell that most of them were not actors, that was jus their lives. The film kept me wanting to see what was going to happen next; even though, throughout the entirety of the film, not much happened. The things they would say, it was so honest and forward, I found myself blushing at moments. Something about it had me wondering why more cultures aren't like this. Even though the film is over ten years old it still resembled something I feel our culture severely lacks, honesty.

 In a class discussion we did however we hit a point I thought was intriguing. The gypsies were pushed away and looked at horribly, yet they did the same to everyone else basically. I didn't look at it that way until it was brought up and it put a little bit of a damper on my theory of them being so honest and pure, when they really did have some naivety and hypercriticism in them as well. They never helped their situation; they embellished their cultures and turned their noses up at the other so to speak.

 From a film stand point I have to mention the cinematography. I loved the fact that the shots weren't particularly important. It was their story that needed to be told. Every once in a while however, you would get a glimpse of some very creative shots that I can easily recall off the top of my head. The spinning in the beginning when the Frenchmen was dancing, I had to even turn away at one point I got so dizzy, I also remember watching the Frenchmen walk along with gypsys being pulled on the wagon, it was crowded and loud, there was so much going on in this little wagon and I felt like I was sitting right along with them. I also remember the two running through the woods way into the film. I loved that shot, if I remember anything from this film that will be it.  The fast pan and the trees as they run stark naked and the playful music flowing perfectly. Without even trying or worrying about it Im sure, the cinematographer managed to grab these beautiful moments and more that in my opinion pull you into the film and possibly may have even saved the film.",1391472000,,2534,4.371549893842888

Exile. Last class we watched a film called The Crazy Stranger. I found this film to be very entertaining. I loved the fact that it was in a completely different language, yet I was still fully intrigued. The beginning scene with the main character dancing really engaged me as a viewer because I was confused by what he was doing. It made me want to watch the movie more and discover his reason behind doing that. The movie is about a young man named Stephano who is a music enthusiast. He seems to only be concerned with finding this one singer called Nora Luca.
 In the process of trying to find this woman, Stephano learns the close knit behavior of the Roma people. I found it interesting how open their culture was. The children at very young ages were saying vulgar curse words that not even people at my age express. There was also a sex scene where the woman came off as classless the way she was speaking. However, that is just how her culture acts.
 One scene in particular I found comical is when Stephano was lectured for cleaning the Izidors house (the old man that brought him into the community). It is seen as wrong and diminishing for a man to clean. Men are superior to women in this particular culture. The people seem as if they are dirty and uncleanly; however, the insides of their houses are spotless. That is interesting, because outside of their homes they do not execute good hygiene. The women were washing their hair with grass and dirt in one of the scenes. All in all, I found it to be both educational and entertaining. Watching it almost made me want to be a part of their culture as well. They are so easy going and their problems seem to very miniscule.",1391472000,,1706,4.447284345047923
7914307,4,B00000K4ZO,"Exile. Crazy Stranger is a movie that follows a young French musicologist, Stephano, threw his encounters with the Roma, people. The young man stricken by grief by the death of his father is on a quest to find the singer, Nora Luca, whose tape was passed down to him by his late father. On his quest he runs into an older gypsy man who decides to take the man back to his village and live amongst his people for a while.
 This film shows the viewer the close knit everyday life of the Roma people. It clearly displays the love they have for music and entertainment as well as the struggles they face from outsiders due to their alternative free lifestyle which, tends to frighten people outside of their society. In an unlikely turn of events they gypsys, who usually keep to themselves, accept the young Frenchman and begin to teach him their ways and treat him like one of them. He accompanies them to the venues that they get paid to entertain at and learns more about their culture through these events.
Some of the interesting practices that I observed while watching the film were the peculiar rituals associated with their wedding and funerary ceremonies. The weddings involve the father of the bride cursing out the husband to be until he is offer an alcoholic beverage and there after accepts the man as family. This reflects the tendency in the gypsys culture to insult one another in a playful manner. The funerary, or burial rituals, also involve alcohol and dancing on the grave of the deceased individual. I found this interesting but I believe this reflects how important music and dance are to the Roma people. It makes sense that they would dance for the deceased because in their culture dance and entertainment is their way of life.",1391472000,,1751,4.666666666666667
7914308,5,B00000K4ZO,"All things Exiled. The Crazy Stranger is a unique movie. This film follows a young man named Stephane as he travel across Europe to find a gypsy singer named Nora Luca. This beginning of this film he meets an elderly man by the name of Izidor, hysterically professing how the ""Gadjo"" or non-gypsy people, have imprisoned his son. These two men, who do not speak the same language become close friends and Izidor brings Stephane into this Romani culture.
 They share music with each other and Stephane becomes fond of these people that adopted him into their lives. Regardless of the events, Stephane tirelessly tries to seek out the singer Nora Luca. Along Stephane's journey he finds love, friends and maybe even a sense of freedom.

This film does a very good job at showing how the Roma people live and behave. Men are seen as superior to the women and do not do any of the cleaning. They have very clean living spaces even when settling in the filthiest of areas. Their art is vibrant whether dancing, singing or painting. The Romani are shown in this film to a strong unity when Stephane enters their town. This film also gives a good sense of how each person works in the community. Each person has their role and they work together like a well oiled machine.

I found this movie to be unusual, charming and funny. This movie portrays these Roma people to be living in squalor. They live in dirty huts but, the insides are almost spotless and well organized. The women are always in very nice and clean clothing. The main character Stephane is very corky and silly. His persistent desire to find Nora Luca is honorable. You get the feeling his desire to find her is because of his father as an effort to stay connected to him. The vulgar and odd dialogue was unusual yet, a fresh change. This film was very insightful about the Romani people and how they interact with outsiders.",1391472000,,1885,4.58753709198813
7914309,5,B00000K4ZO,"The Movie Gadjo Dilo which is translated to The Crazy Stranger one can see the struggle of fitting in. The main character, Stephane, has to pretend to act like one of the gypsies in a small town filled with them so that he can chase after the singer his dad use to sing him when he was younger. As audiences we know what is like to have dreams, but in this movie we see the main character chasing his dream and even though communication is lacking throughout the movie we see how both characters laugh and enjoy each others presence.
This movie is also set in a modern time since we constantly see translations of the way that teenagers and young adults talk. For instance, Stephane falls for a girl named Sabina who is portrayed as a whore for having left her husband and returning to town. In doing this she did something outside her culture which is frowned upon since woman are supposed to be obedient and tied down to one man. In this love scene we see their passionate love and we see their larger than life personality which makes the audience relate to these characters. Aside from that we see that their great flaw is one of exploring and redefining themselves which is why their attraction was so potent. All in all, audience can agree that the best part of this movie is that culture had a lot to do with the morals that were passed down, however, one must pave the way of the life we want to follow.",1391472000,,1411,4.3688212927756656
