545435,4,6303057950,"Hello, I gave this ""film"" four stars because I like horribly bad movies. In fact, the only nice thing I can say about it is that it features the combined star power of Erin Gray AND Dirk Benedict!! It's an ultra-cheap X-Files knockoff featuring a dumb bald guy and an alien whose facial expression makes him look like he's a fluffer in an extra-terrestrial porno. If you're a cinema masochist, check it out. Just make sure to stock up on beer.",1115942400,6,443,4.481481481481482

7835975,4,6303057950,"Not bad little sci-fi drama.  A man who has been repeatedly abducted by UFOs (no one, including his wife, believes him) is recruited by a secret organization of the government to communicate with a captured gray.  I guess the official government spooks believe him.  Though for the most part the Army brass don't want to harm the ""alien"", there is one particular officer that means no good to the humanoid.  The recruited abductee helps the gray escape.  The man's wife comes along to help and off they go on a road trip.  The end is surprising and both sad and uplifting.  I won't spoil it for you.  It also has a very important message; TAKE CARE OF THE PLANET.  I hope this film is released to DVD very soon.  Highly recommended.",1438473600,,732,4.519083969465649
7835976,5,6303057950,"Outstanding movie! Really makes you think.  This is one of Parker Stevenson's and Dirk Benedict's best shows.  Perfect for family, no guts, blood & gore in this one.",1420329600,,165,4.857142857142857

7835979,5,6303057950,"Very good movie with an interesting message, but from toady's point of view it's a bit naive. However it does not diminish its importance.  Unlike many similar sci-fi movies, this one is not ridden with inconsistencies and the script was nicely executed.
The rather peaceful tone of the film was ""spiced up"" with a bad-ass intelligence officer (Dirk Benedict) whose motto was ""shoot first and then ask questions"".  All in all, it is the kind of movie I like to watch from time to time.",1342483200,,485,4.694117647058824
7835980,5,6303057950,"Loved this movie!!  Bought it because of Chad Everett, who plays General Spalding, but thoroughly enjoyed movie.  Has to do with aliens and alien abductions,and I love that kind of stuff!!",1312934400,,188,5.032258064516129
7835981,5,6303057950,"I, too, saw this movie on TV many years ago. For all things that fall into the ufo genre, why has this not been made available in dvd format? I am pretty sure we can put some of the junk aside and make space for a well done option. And no beer needed.",1309737600,,251,3.7547169811320753
7835982,4,6303057950,"A Horrible movie? From what I can recall way back when--when I saw it on TV, I was kind of impressed with it and I've been wanting to include it to my library ever since and that was many, many moons ago; too many to count I'm afraid. But be that as it may--this movie has a great cast; couldn't ask for a better one if you tried. No longer do I have a VCR, so I have to wait for Offical Denial to come out on DVD format; I've been waiting for quite a spell. I do hope I don't have to wait for very much longer. Isn't that usually the case? The movie that you're really itchin' for, you have to wait the longest time before it does come out on the DVD format. Hopefully, it will just be around the bend.
With a film like this, it takes a good actor to make the movie good and I believe that Parker Stevenson was one of the key stars in the film. Yes, it's time for a refresher course; can't wait, but will have to. P.A.
