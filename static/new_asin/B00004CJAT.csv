1339135,5,B00004CJAT,"First off, I did see Johnny Depp's ""From Hell"" (2002). While I did like that version, it concentrated more on horror than history. This version with Michael Caine is more historical. Obviously, no one will ever know the full truth behind Jack the Ripper. However, if the theories in Michael Caine's movie are true, they certainly explain many things. (Why Jack was never identified, why Jack was never caught in the act, why Jack did what he did, etc.) This movie is about 4 hours long, but it is NEVER BORING. Even with only 5 murders for a 4 hour movie, the suspense rarely drops. Interestingly, as in history, there are 5 murders. Yet, the blood and effects are really controlled. (Some directors seem to know that blood in itself is not a scary thing. Rather, the story that surrounds the murders is the more important element. Even more so, excess blood only makes things look unrealistic if not laughable.) Comic relief and misleads are well placed. Another thing I can say about this movie is that we get to know the misleads a bit, and at times even feel sorry for them. Interestingly, this movie cleverly avoids the simple formula of good guy versus bad guy. Scotland Yard and the local police are both trying to stop Jack the Ripper. But do they work together well? Certainly not often! I can't say too much without ruining the story. However, I can say in 4 hours or so, not one moment of the movie is wasted time. Perhaps some of you will feel that Jack the Ripper is the star of this movie. Alright. Maybe he is. But of Michael Caine as the Scotland Yard Inspector trying to put an end to Jack the Ripper's reign of terror, Caine's performance is nothing short of PHENOMENAL. Unlike the fake Hollywood heroes, Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline portrays a realistic hero. He has faults. (He is an alcoholic.) He goes through frustration and rages. At times, he makes jokes. While attentive to his duties, he also has to deal with his ego. (He wants to beat the local cops to Jack the Ripper.) He makes mistakes. (He is brutal with innocent parties at times.) He goes through personal disappointments. (A shattered relationship.) But like a true Charles Dickens hero, he rises above his faults, eventually puts certain grudges behind him, and rises to the occasion of facing Jack the Ripper himself! This movie can make one wonder if Michael Caine deserves a place in history almost on the same level as Sir Laurence Olivier. Hopefully, this movie will be available on dvd and vhs soon. If you like Michael Caine in this, you may also wish to check him out as Alfred in the recent ""Batman Begins."" ""Noises Off"" shows a great comical side of Michael Caine. He was also an impressive Scrooge in ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol."" I'll conclude by saying that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Inspector Fred Abberline in ""From Hell"" is certainly worth looking at. But Michael Caine's movie is probably the more historically accurate.",1141516800,45,2940,4.688588007736944

1339151,5,B00004CJAT,"This is one of those works of cinematography where they did such a good job of scriptrwriting, costuming, set building, casting and acting that while watching it the viewer just feels totally immersed in the acts.

I remember when this came out as a TV miniseries. Was impressed with it then and am impressed with my DVD copy of it now. One thing the TV series had that the DVD apparently does not is several alternate endings based on different theories of who JTR really was.

1339176,3,B00004CJAT,"REVIEW IS FOR BLURAY

In a nutshell; this show is great - brilliant acting, sets, story, atmosphere etc. The massive disappointment with this bluray is the sub-standard picture quality. It looks very soft and hardly passes as high definition bluray quality. The amateurs who approved this transfer should bow their heads in shame.

- it was shot on 35mm film and it should look as sharp as a razor. It's a waste of time putting it on a bluray when a high bit-rate DVD would have looked the same!",1433548800,,495,4.550561797752809

1339192,3,B00004CJAT,"Handsome television film about the infamous Victorian serial killer produced in 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the murders.  Michael Caine is good as real life Scotland Yard inspector Frederick Abberline, who was in charge of the actual case, and Caine may be the standout reason to watch this particular version of the Ripper story, which has been oft-filmed over the years.  The film invents a fictionalized characterization of Abberline as a has been detective prone to alcoholism, who is given one last chance by superiors to solve the crime. Romantic back story involving beautiful Jane Seymour is also added for filler.  Much attention is also given to Jekyll and Hyde actor Richard Mansfield (Armand Assante), another real life character, who is considered a suspect and is connected to Seymour as well.  The sets, costumes and atmosphere are excellent, and there is resolute depiction of the investigation, without showing the crimes themselves, but what is missing are any thrills.  Being a made for television effort this Ripper isn't lurid enough for what today's audiences might expect.  It simply can't compete with R rated updates like the 2000 'From Hell', (in which Johnny Depp portrayed Abberline) nor the 1972 Klaus Kinski/Jess Franco feature.  And technique wise, it pales in comparison to both Hitchcock's silent 1927 version of 'The Lodger' and the 1944 Hollywood remake, which still remain today as the best cinematic treatments ever of the Jack the Ripper motif. Serious buffs may also be disappointed with the ending, and this film can only be recommended for those who merely want to take a light romp into Ripper realm.",1421020800,,1648,5.126865671641791
1339193,5,B00004CJAT,"Still as effective as it was when originally aired in the 1980's.  But how can you beat Michael Caine performing in anything?  Even if modern research and analysis has shifted the suspicion/guilt away from this film's targeted guilty man, the whole story holds up extremely well.",1418169600,,279,5.043478260869565
1339194,5,B00004CJAT,"Wonderful movie.  How can you not like it with the cast assembled.  I first saw this movie in 1989, before kids.

As for Michael Caine, great actor, but I've never seen one of his movies when he doesn't scream or yell at someone.  You can almost always expect it.  What can I say about Jane Seymore...always at her best, but in this movie her role  didn't do her justice.  She's so beautiful and talented, I would like to have seen her more in the movie.  Armand Assante, would I would give...enough said!!!  Finally, the detective assistant to Caine was very supportive and just an overall good actor.  Well worth the purchase.",1410825600,,677,4.575

1339201,4,B00004CJAT,"Loved this miniseries when I was younger (14).  I've always been a fan of Michael Caine and interested in the Ripper mystery.  Some of what is shown here has been debunked since 1988, but that doesn't take away from the fact it was intensely researched at the time to present the best theory then of the Ripper's identity.  High quality production for a TV movie, almost up there with the original ""Lonesome Dove.""  And the quality of this DVD set shocked me, the picture and sound even better than I remembered from the original broadcast.  Caine turns in a wonderful performance as a boozy police inspector seeking redemption in a case he suspects he's never meant to solve.  If you only know him today from Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" series, you're in for a pleasant surprise.",1409356800,3,781,4.7481481481481485

Without a doubt.....I enjoyed it even more this time around and I will enjoy it again and again for many years to come.  It treats the story with diligent, historical accuracy and Michael Caine is absolutely incredible.  An outstanding product at a very reasonable price.",1403827200,,401,4.940298507462686
1339204,5,B00004CJAT,"Who was Jack the Ripper?  On Doctor Who he was eaten by a Lizard Lady, in Shanghai Knights, he was killed by Jackie Chan's sister.  This movie starts out by saying this movie was based evidence from Scotland yard and various government files.  Michael Cain is excellent as Inspector Frederick Abberline.  We follow the story from the first victim to the last.  We was as evidence is collected, suspects interviewed and theories examined.  Unlike the CSI shows of today Scotland Yard had very no electronic machines to sample evidence and they had to be very methodical in their investigation.  I really enjoyed this story and all actors do a fantastic job.  The story line keeps you going and keeps you guessing right up to the end.  If their version of the Jack the Ripper story is true then that's great, but the producers added their spin on the story then it is still a great story and fun to watch.  I liked it when it was on TV and I enjoyed it on Video.",1402876800,5,960,4.4655172413793105
1339205,5,B00004CJAT,This one being my favorite. The pairing of Michael Caine and Lewis Collins was outstanding. It doesn't get any better then Caine going off on people here as the real Inspector. Lewis Collins is someone I felt could play James Bond if you happen to see his other work on a t.v. series called The Professionals. Sadly he passed on but his role as Sgt. Godley will not be forgotten. The movie takes real elements and suspects of the ripper case and makes for a very interesting movie that keeps your attention til the end. The other half of what I feel are the two best is Murder By Decree. Both should be in a true Ripperologests collection.,1400803200,,639,4.423728813559322

But I'd rate this even higher than From Hell on the watchability scale. I've watched this more times than any other Ripper film, so that must say something. I believe my favorite thing about it are all the scenes between Abberline (Caine) and the other officers talking through the facts (or what pass for facts in this movie) to get to the next lead. Of course the 'solution' is entirely fictional. Sir William Gull was not the Ripper. But it's still good television.",1389830400,2,594,4.613207547169812
1339221,5,B00004CJAT,This account of Jack the Ripper is one of the most thorough movies I've viewed about this serial killer.  While some portions of the film may be fictional it certainly makes a person consider that the Queen's physician may very well have been the perpetrator of the heinous murders attributed to Jack the Ripper.  Interesting film that will keep you on the edge of your seat as you accompany Inspector Abberline in his investigation of the murders.  Michael Caine gave an excellent portrayal of Inspector Abberline.  You won't regret purchasing this movie.,1389830400,,556,5.010869565217392

Since it was a network production there is vey little gore and not as much blood as there probably would be today.  The performances are first-rate.  The producers make note of the fact that even though they give their interpretation of who the Ripper might have been, no one can state positively who he was.

1339241,5,B00004CJAT,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and I've watched it several times over the years. I'll first give some notes about the only current blu-ray version which offers English or German language options only.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The only blu-ray version of this movie that currently exists is a Region B German release, so it cannot be viewed on US players.
NTSC/PAL 'all region' blu-ray players are available on Amazon should US customers like to purchase one.

I bought this blu-ray movie from Amazon UK because the total price is currently cheaper than buying from Amazon US.

Viewers can watch the movie & bonus features in either English or German.

Considering this was a 1988 made for TV movie, the audio and video quality are very good.

BLU-RAY BONUS FEATURES:
Some of the blu-ray extras are also found on previous DVD releases. By far, the best bonus feature on this blu-ray is the audio commentary by David Wickes with researcher Susan Davies and journalist Johnathon Sothcott. Susan Davies did 4 years of extensive research on Jack the Ripper and this movie runs along the lines of a particular theory as to who Jack might actually have been, though no one knows for certain and we will probably never know his identity.

There is also a 'Deleted Scenes' extra, but this mostly looks like rehearsal material so in my opinion is not really worth watching a second time. These have Barry Forster as Inspector Abberline, before Michael Caine was finally selected to play that role.

For those unfamiliar with Jack, there is a 'Documentation' extra that briefly recounts the actual events that took place in London, 1888.

It really would have been nice to include actor interviews and commentary as extra features, and this will hopefully be done on future blu-ray releases.

THE MOVIE:
Jack the Ripper was released in 1988 to mark the first centenary of the original events. It was first aired in the US as a 2 part TV mini-series. The movie length is 189 minutes.

It stars Michael Cane in the lead role as Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline of Scotland Yard and Armand Assante as American actor Richard Mansfield playing the lead in the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde premiere at the Lyceum theatre. Both of these performers were excellent, and I thought all of the players were quite good except for Michael Gothard who over-played the role of Lusk, maybe because that script could have been better and more accurately written to protray the actual Mr. Lusk rather than this hyped up movie version.

The story recounts the murder of 5 prostitutes and the hunt for Jack the Ripper. It is not always factually accurate and does employ 'dramatic license' several times to appeal to audiences, but it is a great movie nonetheless. Director/Producer David Wickes and his crew did an excellent job on this film. The cinematography, realistic Victorian settings and costumes are excellent.

In 1989, Michael Caine won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV, and Armand Assante was Nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. The movie was also Nominated for Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV.

I watched it in two parts over two nights, but would have watched at once if time permitted.

IMO, the acting was very strong, all the characters were very believable.

I thought Nedley was really funny.

The setting is also on point and gives you a good feel of the time period.

There is really no blood/gore, but this film did not need it.

Not to mention the BBFC would never allow it at the time.

I was only 9 years old when this originally aired on television in the U.S. With that said it was a pleasure to revisit this wonderful film after so many years. Thanks oddly enough to my mother, I am a huge fan of this particular version of the ripper story. Years later I found myself bringing her to the local cinema where we watched ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp. She and I later agreed that while the stories were similar, Michael Caine's version is/was/forever will be the best portrayal of Inspector Abberline. The romantic sub-plot with Jane Seymour serves little purpose, but otherwise this is a solid ""old-fashioned"" detective story. Perhaps I'm being nostalgic, but this film will always have a place in my collection.",1331769600,4,781,4.835820895522388

But it is, in fact, yet another piece of Ripper fiction loosely based on royal conspiracy theories that have been thoroughly debunked by Ripper experts.  First shown in the Fall of '88, the centennial anniversary of the killings, the 3-hour, 2-part miniseries is nevertheless an entertaining and suspenseful Victorian whodunit that will hold your attention throughout. With nice production values for a miniseries, a fine score by John Cameron, and a rare TV performance by Michael Caine, who plays Inspector Abberline, the film tells the story of the crimes and the ensuing investigation with great intrigue and flair, complete with bloody letters, clairvoyance, play-within-a-play, and the usual parade of suspects.  The end result is never boring, and may hold up for repeated viewings (I have watched it several times).  Just don't believe anything in it, even as the narrator declares at the end, ""We believe our story to be true."" Simply enjoy it for what it is - an engaging police procedural and period drama.  Ripper followers will probably delight in seeing the many historical figures depicted in the film: from Abberline, Charles Warren, William Gull, to would-be suspects like John Pizer, Jacob Isenschmid, and Richard Mansfield.  We also see some of the victims that have been so immortalized by these crimes; only three have speaking parts - Liz Stride, Kate Eddowes, and Mary Kelly - who are all depicted rather unflatteringly here, as opposed to being sympathetically portrayed in the 2001 film ""From Hell"", another royal-themed Ripper yarn.  All murders occur off-screen, but there are a few gory bits that were trimmed in some TV reruns.

This Warner Archive DVD is, of course, uncut.  Its picture quality is excellent, sharper, cleaner, and showing more details than the UK Region-2 DVD edition by Anchor Bay/Freemantle, the only other edition available for this film that I know.  The Dolby Digital mono sound is also sharper and clearer.  The film is presented in the original TV broadcast aspect ratio of 1.33:1, which shows much more picture at the top and bottom than the widescreen Region-2 DVD.  The two 90-minute episodes are put onto two single-layered all-region NTSC DVD-R discs, without any subtitles, closed captioning, nor any bonus features.  When I opened my brand-new case, I noticed minor scuff marks on the dye side of one of the discs, indicating the apparent lack of care that results from the low-budgetness of this line of products.  The playback was fine, however.  And the few Warner Archive DVDs that I have seen do have good to great video and audio transfers, so I usually buy them with confidence.",1312243200,8,3152,5.676595744680851
1339266,4,B00004CJAT,"Excellent & creative retelling of this grisly tale.  Michael Caine is in fine form.  Occasionally a little slow in spots, but that's due to it's length, & not the story itself.",1306281600,5,176,4.645161290322581
1339267,5,B00004CJAT,"I bought the DVD directly from WB, where they basically burn off a copy, bare bones, and that was fine since the price they offered was substantially lower than here with free shipping. I hear there is a special edition with commentary from the director and that I would be interested in hearing.

For a made for tv movie, this one looks pretty good and the sound is very nice, too. I like the music and the acting is first-rate by the entire cast. Michael Caine is particularly effective as Inspector Abberline. In total the movie is about 3 and a half hours but it moves very fast. It is also very atmsopheric and feels like 19th Century London.

As for the conclusions the filmmakers came up with, I have no idea if they are plausible or not. I have heard some criticize this for coming to erroneous conclusions. Maybe they are, I don't know but I base my review on the entertainment value and not as a documentary. And since the identity of the Ripper was never proven, who is to say they are wrong?

I also like that they had some fun with this movie, meaning there were scenes that were played for laughs to break up the other scenes of chasing the killer.

Now, I wouldn't buy this unless you are sure so go and rent it first. I believe it to be a compelling movie and I have now seen it about a dozen times. It is an excellent movie.",1294617600,11,1341,4.267716535433071

Has a great ending too, really makes you wonder. Glad to find it available on DVD.",1289606400,14,498,4.144329896907217
1339270,5,B00004CJAT,"It had been 22 years since I first saw this TV mini-series back in 1988. And although I'd forgotten all but a few scenes, and especially the ending, which is a good thing as it was like watching it with fresh eyes,  it makes me wonder what ever happened to the entertaining and sometimes great TV mini-series of the 70's, & 80's!
Current TV seems to be sadly lacking in this area!

This was really quite good, and Michael Caine is in top form along with a host of English actors in supporting roles! The women here, I'm afraid to say where pretty much used as canon fodder for the Ripper, so there isn't much character development happening with them, except for Jane Seymour whom has the Lion's share of the women's scenes.

The production values and sets both interior & exterior really convey the time period of London, 1888! One gets a board sense of Old London as huge streets scenes and huge offices are included, painting a bigger canvas!

 Stated in the prologue; 100 years ago in 1888 Jack the Ripper started on his crime spree of murdering prostitutes in the White Chapel area on London!
And of course the mini-series itself was made in 1988 capitalizing on the Century factor of the horrid events! I won't give away anything more, but you're in for a treat at 3 plus hours running time & well worth the price of admission!

The made to order DVD-R from the ""Warner Bros. Archive Collections"" is in full screen and looked very good on a 52"" screen, even with the black bars, left & right I still had a very BIG PICTURE!
This was the original format it was filmed in, as made for TV movies & all TV series were filmed for the full screen TV's until widescreens came out!

Color is very good, and I saw no artifacts that could be a distraction!
It played well on a standard DVD player without any problem, so I guess that even though it is a DVD-R Duplication and not a production run on Replication machines, used for most commercial releases, that doesn't seem to factor into the play-back or quality.

It is a little bit disappointing that both Warner's & Universal have decided to ""make on demand"" DVD-R's instead of wide commercial releases of their historic titles,  but I assume the sales figures don't justify the cost. I then have to use caution at these prices, but Jack the Ripper was well worth it & I think I'll watch it all over again for a second time before it hits the shelf!

It avoids tawdriness and takes a serious non-expoitive look at the events in White Chapel over a century ago.  It's primarily a detective story meticulously exploring every possible angle to the string of murders of five streetwalkers in East London.  Not only does the film cover the policework but it also touches on the political ramifications, the corruption of the local constabulary, the yellow journalism, as well as the anarchists who exacerbate matters.  All anchored by another brilliant performance by Michael Caine as Scotland Yard investigator Frederick Abberline who has the unenviable task of ferretting out the murderer(s).  Before I watched this my brother inadvertently blurted out who the murderer(s) were because he saw it on original broadcast in 1988.

Michael Caine is excellent as Abberline as he works his way through a large list of suspects and red herrings to come to a somewhat plausible, if not original conclusion.  Based on the performances and atmosphere, I still think this remains as good a Ripper movie as they've ever done.  ""From Hell"" was more flashy, and was still good, but this is your classic ""whodunit"" involving Jack the Ripper.

The made to order DVDs were also excellent and it a very good way to get more obscure movies into the hands of fans who have waited indefinitely to see them released mass market.",1266537600,3,684,4.448
1339311,5,B00004CJAT,"FAR AND AWAY, THE BEST AND MOST PLAUSIBLE VERSION TO DATE
(This is a repost of my original review)

Michael Caine as Insp Abberline and Lewis Collins as Sgt Godley are a match made in police Heaven. They complement each other perfectly and work together on Scotland Yard's most famous unsolved case, still argued about to this day among Ripperologists.
The storyline is the most plausible, following Stephen Knight's The Final Solution faithfully. This theory exlains all the questions one has re: these murders and brings up one more that this version did NOT elaborate on, which is: Did Queen Victoria KNOW about (and condone) these murders in order to preserve the-then shaky state of the Monarchy?
The Freemason link, the murders done in accordance with a traitor's death in the Society, explains the more graphic details of the murders, and also the WHY of them. Sir William Gull, physician to the Queen, was also high up in the Masonic arena.
The carriage driver, Netley, (the real Netley died, fittingly, under the wheels of his own coach...an accident?) is played to the hilt by George Sweeney; just as slimy as the real driver most likely was...""impress a little man.""
Armand Assante is great as the American actor Richard Mansfield, and Richard Morant as Dr Acland, Gull's son-in-law, is brilliant.
The most amazing aspect of this particular version is the taut pace which holds the viewer mesmerized for the duration of approx four hours!
The various characters, and the sub-stories within the whole, are fascinating and lend total credibility to the production. The real horror is suggested, and the director and writer wisely leave the bulk of the details to the imagination, which is more powerful than any written word. One shot which left me breathless with horror was the shot of the back of the carriage with blood streaming underneath. Then, of course, the one second glimpse of the Mary Kelley murder scene, the only Ripper murder committed within the privacy of a room, thus allowing JTR to do his work in peace at his leisure, a benefit he took full advantage of...this photograph actually exists, a contemporary work done due to the belief the face of the murderer might still be visible on the eyes of the corpse. It is horrific.
So see this one, it is magnificent and explains, really, the most plausible solution to this murder mystery with so many previously unanswered questions:
Why was the Ripper never caught despite heavy police presence?
Why was there never any blood found at the crime scenes?
Why these particular five ""soiled doves?""
Why did the murders suddenly stop?
How was the Ripper able to move about with such ease, seemingly invisible, and why were the prossies so willing to go with this stranger when they should have been on their guard?
Why were Ripper files missing from Scotland Yard years later?
And why was the only crime scene evidence, the words of JTR, cleaned off immediately on the orders of Chief Superintendent Arnold?
""The Juwes are the men who will not be blamed for nothing""; removed, ostensibly, to offset any more anti-Semitic feelings of the time, were not, in point of fact, a reference to Jews at all, but refers to Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum who murdered Hiram Abif and were eventually found and ritually killed. See Masonic history for more info.
""Juwes"" is said by Masons to refer to these three mythical characters at the time of the building of Solomon's temple. This is one of many pieces of evidence that masons and masonic symbolism may have been involved in these horrific murders...the murders themselves done according to Masonic ritual.
Robert James Lees, psychic, actually did predict, (his visions were so disturbing to him he left London briefly...upon his return, the visions came back) uncannily, the murders, and was later said to have cooperated with Insp Abberline who listened to him with great interest and followed him as they walked from the last crime scene up to the door of a wealthy surgeon of the day.

1339317,3,B00004CJAT,"Oh please, there isn't 5 minutes of truth in this thing.  However, some of the acting is fine (especially Caine whom I love despite his frequent screams) and by the guy who played Sergeant Godley and another fellow who played a slimely newspaper reporter for ""The Star"".. But this 4 hour CBS miniseries tells us that Aberline wasn't married (he was) and strongly suggests that the American actor Richard Mansfield was a prime suspect-he was not.  In an interview published way after the events of 1888, Aberline thought that Godley had arrested the Ripper-a Polish emigre barber-surgeon named George Chapman--no relation to victim #2.  So what of the premise of this whole production?

But the mini-series (which I taped in November of 1988 and still watch occasionally) does have beautiful costumes, wonderful sets, and a snappy pace.  But don't believe a word of it.",1242777600,3,868,5.0

1339345,4,B00004CJAT,"Chief Insp. Frederick Abberline (Michael Caine) heads up the London Police Force's investigative attempts to stop the activities of notorious serial killer Jack the Ripper, in Victorian London. He's assisted in this quest, by, among others, his partner Sgt. George Godley (Lewis Collins), society psychic Robert James Lees (Ken Bones) and artist ex-girlfriend Emma Prentiss (Jane Seymour).

A CBS/Thames Television co-production, way back in the day when there was no such thing as BBC America, HBO or Masterpiece Theater, this 1988 television miniseries is of unusually high standard: the acting's top-drawer, the production is detailed and lush, and the direction tense and exciting. Weighing in at a hefty 182 minutes, when viewed in DVD format, there's little repetition and next-to-no boring bits: for all the right reasons this is one eighties miniseries that's well-worth hunting down.

Caine and Collins have an excellent chemistry together as partner detectives, and Caine's performance in particular is whole and likeable. Jane Seymour's role isn't huge, nor does it do anything besides providing a backstory for Caine's haunted detective, but she plays it very well. Other cast nods must go to Ken Bones as the snivelling, bohemian Lees, Susan George's effective, endearing cameo as Kate Eddowes, and Ray McAnally as doctor/scientist Sir William Gull.

The production design is straightforward enough - Victorian London isn't a very difficult look to recreate - but there's plenty of attention to detail and lots of beautiful costume design on offer. Director David Wickes (who went on to direct some very successful Jekyll & Hyde and Frankenstein TV movies) does an excellent job of juxtaposing the reserved nature of the visuals with the violence and upheaval of London on the brink of near-anarchy, and there's a real sense of terror in the scenes where Jack the Ripper is at work.

It's not all good news, mind you - Armand Assante's Richard Mansfield is way too campy, Michael Gothard gives a lousy performance as George Lusk and some of the sub-plots get tied up too conveniently - there are a few parts where this otherwise-wonderful drama reminds us that we are indeed watching a TV miniseries.

But thankfully these moments are few and far between, and, for the most part, this ""Jack The Ripper"" is a highly polished, well-made and finely acted horror/drama. Also, unlike ""From Hell"", the conclusion is kept from the viewer until the final reels: it might not be the most historically accurate portrayal, but for entertainment value, there's no other rendition of this story that surpasses it.

Highly recommended.",1200268800,60,2634,5.229857819905213
1339346,2,B00004CJAT,"I saw this film a few years ago and thought it very good as a horror movie.

Yet as history, its nonsense.

The film is largely based on Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution (1977), except the connection with Queen Victoria's son is missing (and quite right, too).

There is no evidence that the murderous couple committed these crimes- certainly the police never thought so and Michael Caine's character, Inspector Abberline thought (almost certainly incorrectly) it was one George Chapman, a posioner, hanged in 1903 for poisoning women. One of the villians in this story had recently suffered a stroke and this elderly man would have had difficulty wielding a knofe at dinner, let alone killing anyone. So the solution presented here is nonsense.

The whole premise of a horse drawn carriage going through Whitechapel slum land is also ridiculous - not one of the witnesses in the real case mentions one.

George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilante Committee is shown here as a socialist agitator - in real life he was a local churchwarden.

Caine's portrayl of the detective is also at odds with what is known of the modest policeman.

To conclude, although a good story, this bears very little relation to the known facts of the case and merely serves to mislead the uninitiated viewer.",1196467200,2,1288,4.8807339449541285

This has never seen the light of day on Region 1 DVD,but it really really should. C'mon, whoever owns this, get this released in the U.S!  :)",1189468800,25,340,4.964912280701754
1339349,5,B00004CJAT,"Michael Caine as Insp Abberline and Lewis Collins as Sgt Godley are a match made in police Heaven. They complement each other perfectly and work together on Scotland Yard's most famous unsolved case, still argued about to this day among Ripperologists.

The storyline is the most plausible, following Stephen Knight's The Final Solution faithfully. This theory exlains all the questions one has re: these murders and brings up one more that this version did NOT elaborate on, which is: Did Queen Victoria KNOW about (and condone) these murders in order to preserve the-then shaky state of the Monarchy?

The Freemason link, the murders done in accordance with a traitor's death in the Society, explains the more graphic details of the murders, and also the WHY of them. Sir William Gull, physician to the Queen, was also high up in the Masonic arena.

The carriage driver, Netley, (the real Netley died, fittingly, under the wheels of his own coach...an accident?) is played to the hilt by George Sweeney; just as slimy as the real driver most likely was...""impress a little man.""

Armand Assante is great as the American actor Richard Mansfield, and Richard Morant as Dr Acland, Gull's son-in-law, is brilliant.

The most amazing aspect of this particular version is the taut pace which holds the viewer mesmerized for the duration of approx four hours!

The various characters, and the sub-stories within the whole, are fascinating and lend total credibility to the production. The real horror is suggested, and the director and writer wisely leave the bulk of the details to the imagination, which is more powerful than any written word. One shot which left me breathless with horror was the shot of the back of the carriage with blood streaming underneath. Then, of course, the one second glimpse of the Mary Kelley murder scene, the only Ripper murder committed within the privacy of a room, thus allowing JTR to do his work in peace at his leisure, a benefit he took full advantage of...this photograph actually exists, a contemporary work done due to the belief the face of the murderer might still be visible on the eyes of the corpse. It is horrific.

So see this one, it is magnificent and explains, really, the most plausible solution to this murder mystery with so many previously unanswered questions:

Why was the Ripper never caught despite heavy police presence?

Why was there never any blood found at the crime scenes?

Why these particular five ""soiled doves?""

Why did the murders suddenly stop?

How was the Ripper able to move about with such ease, seemingly invisible, and why were the prossies so willing to go with this stranger when they should have been on their guard?

Why were Ripper files missing from Scotland Yard years later?

And why was the only crime scene evidence, the words of JTR, cleaned off immediately on the orders of Chief Superintendent Arnold?

""The Juwes are the men who will not be blamed for nothing""; removed, ostensibly, to offset any more anti-Semitic feelings of the time, were not, in point of fact, a reference to Jews at all, but refers to Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum who murdered Hiram Abif and were eventually found and ritually killed. See Masonic history for more info.

""Juwes"" is said by Masons to refer to these three mythical characters at the time of the building of Solomon's temple. This is one of many pieces of evidence that masons and masonic symbolism may have been involved in these horrific murders...the murders themselves done according to Masonic ritual.

 Robert James Lees, psychic, actually did predict, (his visions were so disturbing to him he left London briefly...upon his return, the visions came back) uncannily, the murders, and was later said to have cooperated with Insp Abberline who listened to him with great interest and followed him as they walked from the last crime scene up to the door of a wealthy surgeon of the day.

1339351,5,B00004CJAT,"Five murders of five prostitutes, taking place in the same area between August 31 and November 9, in 1888.  To this day, the case remains officially unsolved.  It's notariety is partially because it was the first serial murder case to be sensationalized in the press.

I saw this excellent version of the story when it originally aired on television.  David Wickes (London Weekend Television) had done it again.  Without getting overly graphic - made for TV, remember - the story of the East End prostitutes was brought to life with beautiful production values, an intelligent screenplay, and a top-flight cast.

The characters of Inspector Abberline (Michael Caine) and Sgt. George Godley are probably more accurate here than they are as portrayed in ""From Hell."" (One major error in ""From Hell"" is the character's death; Abberline died in 1929 of old age in Bournemouth.) They are played here as real; the sub-plot of Richard Mansfield (Armand Assante) is woven in authentically.  The mood of the times is re-created with startling clarity, and the sequence of events holds with historical facts, only two or three minor exceptions.

The plotline of this version starts with Mary Nicholls' death, and follows through the investigation and confusion of the case, with each successive death adding to the tensions and social unrest.  Mary Kelly was the last, and then Jack vanished into the mists of history.  Although the running time on this version seems overlong (it was shown in two parts originally), the pacing never allows boredom to creep in.  Wickes' production (he also directed) came to a conclusion similar to those presented in ""Murder by Decree"" (fictionalized to include Sherlock Holmes) and ""From Hell.""  What is presented here is labeled as opinion, and it is plausible.

This is the one I watch again and again. If you see a copy, grab it!  Here's hoping the DVD will become available.",1147392000,7,1904,5.022292993630574

Caine grew up in the area of London where these murders happened and they were most certainly a big part of local folklore when he was a child.  Caine does his usual workmanlike job in this picture and it seems to me that the movie uses some of the real crime scenes for filming, that or they recreated them brick-by-brick.  To pad the show out to about 3 1/2 hrs they include a few side stories and an unnecessary romantic interest for Caine's Inspector Abeline but overall it's time well spent.  The movie proposes to have solved the crime and while I don't agree with their solution, how they get there is well done.
