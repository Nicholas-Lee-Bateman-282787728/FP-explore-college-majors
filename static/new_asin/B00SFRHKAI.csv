6980213,4,B00SFRHKAI,"Decent action flick.. right out the box. Not great but entertaining for the 2 hours. If you want great acting, watch something else. If you just want solid action, you will enjoy this film.",1425081600,,189,4.588235294117647

6980218,5,B00SFRHKAI,"This is the Australian version of the French film A Prophet (2009).  Just like in the French production, we have here a young and nave guy (JR played by Brenton Thwaites)  who is sent to prison for a short stay.  In order to survive (not get raped and abused by other prisoners) he is offered a protection in return for a favor from a notorious criminal played by Ewan McGregor (he should play more often dark characters). JR soon realizes that without Brendan's help (McGregor) he will end up like his cell-mate, constantly raped and in effect--suicidal. He agrees to return favor to Brendan once he is released from prison.  After few months stay, JR leaves prison and settles in Brendan's city apartment awaiting further instructions on the escape plan for Brendan and his prison buddies.  To go further into the plot of this terrific Aussi action-crime drama would only spoil the film...

The main and supporting cast is international: we have here Ewan McGregor (Scott), Brenton Thwaites (Australian), Alica Vikander (Swedish), and Jacek Koman (Polish)...

Son of a Gun (2014) is a much better film than over-hyped Australian crime-thriller Animal Kingdom (2010) or even The Horseman (2008).",1423958400,60,1196,5.01010101010101
6980219,4,B00SFRHKAI,"JR (Brenton Thwaites) meets crime boss Brendan (Ewan McGregor) while in prison. Brendan covers JR's behind, who now owes Brendan. When JR gets out of prison, his first order to aid and abet in a prison break. Once out our twosome embark on a gold heist...with a girl (Alicia Vikander) in the plot to supply some conflict.

This was a fairly decent gangster film. It is one worth viewing, but not one I would view a second time. The actors were not overly convincing.

McGreggor, what can I say, the man delivers, he is a future force to be reckoned with. The beautiful young couple were beautiful to watch. The movie had an edge. It almost had 5. The ending was good. The thing that kept it from 5 was some trouble spots midway with the shootout scenes and morals and whatever, who cares, it was fun and fast, not really a 5 star, but honestly better than a 4 star but still a 4 star. Fun to watch for folks who like HEAT or I don't know, anything action/drama/heist/jail break, whatever. It was fun, watch it....",1485734400,,701,4.0503597122302155

6980319,5,B00SFRHKAI,"This is now my favorite Ewan McGregor film. While the story involves hardened criminals, various felonious activity and violence - and one should have no sympathy for the characters - the writer (who also directed the film) clearly had a vision that compels the viewer to root for the main characters'  success - not against the law-abiding people, but against the other bad actors and in their relationship. A well done, engaging and peculiarly satisfying movie.  Sol Seppy's hauntingly moving ""Enter One"" at the end of the film was an especially nice touch (for me). 5 stars!",1485302400,,577,4.938144329896907

6980514,5,B00SFRHKAI,Big budget cinematography and good casting helped make this a realistic feeling heist/prison break movie.  End of the movie did feel unrealistic but since it was the last 5 minutes or so it really didn't bother me. I liked the combination of a prison break movie and heist movie rolled into one. Interesting and entertaining plot overall with good conflict between the main characters. It only felt slightly predictable to me which is my usual criticism of most movies. Classic heroes journey /loss of innocence story line that was well acted out by the main character. Good character development and I liked the happy ending even though that felt extremely unrealistic.  I thought that the main character (not familiar with the actor's name who I have seen in other movies) and Ewan McGregors acting performances really made the movie. Lot of action for action fans like me. Worth watching and even though I got it free on prime I would pay to rent it and would have been happy to catch it in theatres and paid full price.,1482883200,,1023,4.741573033707865

6980638,3,B00SFRHKAI,"This functional heist drama is missing -- something. I couldn't place it exactly. While reasonably enjoyable, it missed the mark.

The characters almost had more depth than a lot of these genre films. But maybe that's the problem. The film chooses to focus on a young inmate jailed for a minor offense, who is coopted by a master thief (Ewan McGregor). I was pleased to see McGregor in this role. ""Trainspotting"" put him on the map as an emaciated heroin addict whose charisma and glib charm shined through. He's passed through dramas and romantic comedies, never getting his due. Here, McGregor is a jacked apex predator and criminal Brendan. He's cunning and ferocious, yet largely quiet and understated. Brendan loosely, and incidentally, resembles Robert DeNiro's thief in Michael Mann's ""Heat"": A consummate professional who employs violence as a tool; never for its own sake.

Maybe this is the problem. McGregor's character, motivations, insights -- they're the best parts of the film. The protagonist is kind of an empty shell; he doesn't really make any hard moral choices. He's kind of a wimp compared to everyone he's up against, but there's no evolution there. I saw a prior comparison of this film to ""A Prophet."" Absolutely not. Where this is a boilerplate film with some good elements and McGregor's performance, it never achieves the depths, symbolism, or character development of ""A Prophet."" You simply don't experience the same transformation. ""A Prophet"" may have been one of the best crash courses in strategy and applied political science on film. There, you watch an illiterate North African criminal work through Muslim and Sardinian crime bosses, mixing long-term planning and opportunistic power grabs. With ""Son of a Gun"" you get a low-level henchman who ..., and while ill-suited to a life of crime doesn't offer and presence of other motivations. The only thing that seems to animate him is an attractive young woman he's fascinated (Alicia Vikander) with who escaped the Ex Machina facility. Vikander shines, but isn't given much to work with. She's a talented chameleon whose appearance and ethnicity shift with roles.

That's not to say this is a bad film. It's better than much of what's offered. It's just simplistic compared to its pretensions. The first 30 minutes are outstanding. Some of the heists are thoughtful and well-executed. There's just not a ton of praise here. McGregor deserved a bonus for keeping the film afloat and offering an original, if underexplored, character. (My comparison to DeNiro in ""Heat"" was analogous; McGregor's Brendan stands on his own.)

Ultimately, it's worth a look. My final comparison would be to ""Gangs of New York,"" a tragically blighted and unsatisfying film. It needed only shift perspective to Daniel Day Lewis's character and follow a rise-and-fall arc. While ""Son of a Gun"" is enjoyable, contrast from McGregor's perspective in some additional scenes could have propelled this film.",1478044800,,2964,5.155925155925156

The prison break was amusing, if rather unbelievable. But I am unacquainted with the intricacies of the Australian prison system, so it may be more plausible a method there than in the United States.

6980790,5,B00SFRHKAI,"I do not write a lot of reviews but feel compelled on this occasion. I'm amazed at the ill informed professional reviewers who have incorrectly criticised this top movie. There is an escape sequence involving a helicopter (no more spoilers) that many reviewers have reported as being ridiculously unlikely. Well some years back a successful jail break occurred in Australia in EXACTLY the way the film portrayed. A case of art imitating life!

In fact, one of the notable aspects of the film is the very realistic action sequences. Gritty and real... like the characters themselves. Cars don't fly through the air due to standard old gags like the pipe roll or under floor cannon.... and they don't spontaneously explode on impact either.  Some reviewers see this sort of restraint as evidence of a tight budget.... I see it as a far more realistic, and therefore engaging, style of filmmaking.

Supercilious, smug professional reviewers so often seem to think that their movie review is about THEM.... about how coolly critical they can make themselves appear. only half watching films while they play with their phones. Because of this, ""Rotten Tomatoes"" now lists this top little crime drama with a mediocre percentage rating. Highly unfair and a poor misrepresentation of ""Son of a Gun"".

""Son of a Gun"" has a good story  with well drawn characters and some great action..... and its as hard as a cold chisel.... Recommended indeed.",1464739200,,1436,4.99163179916318

6981005,3,B00SFRHKAI,"Decent film. Not much to say about it, had some good scenes, and it was great seeing Ewan McGregor act again. The romance plot was absolutely forced and unneeded, an overused trope that brought the film down in some respects. Although it admittedly tied everything in the end, but it was all a little too happy-go-lucky for me. The soundtrack is awful, unfortunately, at least when the romance bits come around. It's like this movie has intense action scenes but then turns around and has some cheesy teen romance music playing when the protagonist and his lover see each other. Totally in conflict with the rest of the film. Like I said before, it felt forced. Worth a watch on a boring afternoon if you're an Ewan fan, otherwise give it a pass.",1455926400,,746,4.616541353383458
6981006,3,B00SFRHKAI,"Standard-fare stylish crime thriller. Young up-and-coming Aussie actor Brenton Thwaites is the callow prison inmate protagonist, while Ewan MacGregor isn't quite convincing as his tough-guy mentor in crime. After they fashion a daring prison breakout, a series of capers ensues.  Plenty of nice plot twists and turns, as would be expected in a crime thriller, but the main attraction here may be the classy Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, who's the flavor of the moment (Ex Machina and The Danish Girl). Might be worth and hour and a half of your time, depending.",1455840000,,564,5.130434782608695

It's not like there's anything original in the storyline, or basic plot, that hasn't already been done before in dozens of prison breakout films.  Brenton Thwaites is great as the neophyte criminal.  He's definitely not a hardened criminal which, I think, makes his character all the more attractive by being less predictable...you're not sure how he's going the react in any given scene.

6981182,4,B00SFRHKAI,Great Crime Drama with plenty of action and plot points to keep you interested without the critical thought as to the reason the characters act the way they do.,1451174400,,160,4.551724137931035
6981183,3,B00SFRHKAI,This movie had the potential to be a great movie. It started off slow but it keep my attention. It had some very good imagery and there were specific details in the movie that made it memorable. But I think because the movie did not have a real plot it lost some of the effectiveness to make it one of those collector movies. I would call this movie a suspense movie with action in it than just an action movie. The producer had an eye and a knack for giving attention to even the smallest details and capturing the audience. But the cohesiveness of the movie was not there to bring everything together. I had to fast forward at some parts because to me it was slow and did not have any impact or reason to be in the movie. But the movie was not the worst movie I have seen. For this movie to be low budget I have to say that it was better than some of the movies that had an enormous budget. But if the movie could have had more of a plot and a little more action in it then it would be a great movie. But I do have to give the producer and actors credit because they really brought the movie to life.,1450742400,4,1102,4.013636363636364

6981345,4,B00SFRHKAI,"This is a suspense movie.  Very good because everything is not what it seems.  There are plenty of twist and turns that makes you say ""wow, I wasn't expecting that.""  Great acting and great storyline.  A nice young man ends up in prison only to be protected by a notorious criminal played by Ewan McGregor, who becomes like a father figure to him.  The young man seems to be great at chess, thus, comes across as someone super smart in the eyes of McGregor, so McGregor takes him under his wings.  This is a Mentor vs. Mentee situation in which eventually the Mentee wants to become as good or even better than the Mentor.  There is a romantic component in this film for the young man who falls for a young lady who is the girlfriend of a notorious gang leader.  This romantic component of course complicates everything.  The question is who is playing who throughout this movie.  This movie is action packed, has romance, has male-bonding, has a story.

6981458,5,B00SFRHKAI,"Different.  I'm a fan of Brenton Thwaites so I was interested to see character development...find out what this movie was about.  Had to adjust to the Australian accents.  Had to 'accept' a few 'convenient' plot issues.  But, let me tell you this:  the video stream stopped right in the middle of the movie.  I sat there confounded and upset...was streaming it through my phone to the TV.  I panicked.  Downloaded the movie right away...waited patiently...and right after it was done, I immediately started to watch it again.  That's when I realized that the movie had captivated me--I couldn't stop watching it or ""wait until later"" as the streaming message suggested.  No way.  I had to finish watching so I could find out what happened.  When a movie does that for me, I don't care what all of the critics or reviewers think about it at all.  As long as it pulls me in...let's me forget about everything else but watching it...and I can't wait to see what's next...that's when I know I can recommend this movie to you.  It was good.

6981460,1,B00SFRHKAI,"Ewan McGregor's name in the credits was enough to entice me to watch this movie.  But it was disappointing in so many ways I cannot give it more than one star.  I simply detested the story.  Maybe this sort of thing happens; I really hope not.  It was so utterly depressing, even Ewan McGregor's excellent performance could not pull it up out of the darkness for me.  The characters are prison inmates.  The protagonist is a you g man who has been sent to do hard time with thugs who want to harm him in unspeakable ways.  Ewan McGregor's character befriends him, and, for a moment, there is hope that the story will have some redeeming quality.  But alas, it is not to be, because he only befriends the young man so that he ca exact some form of repayment once he is released.  When he is released, in just six months, then the favors begin to be reclaimed.  The basic premise of the story is that one who has committed a crime minor enough to receive a sentence of six months is incarcerated with hardened thugs who have been sentenced to 20 years or more.  Disaster, right?  So is the movie.",1444521600,,1094,4.361386138613861

Ewan McGregor speaks with a Scottish accent, the girl has a Russian accent, the boy speaks ""clearest"" of them all, and the rest have Australian accents. The story-line has a bit of everything: Prison reality, life of the mob, dangerous romance, loyalty between outlaws. You can see some violence (and a few bare breasts), but nothing too extreme. If you like movies about prison breaks,  outlaws on the run, with a few twists and (in my eyes) a good ending, this is one for you.",1443398400,,710,4.419847328244275

6981602,3,B00SFRHKAI,Pretty good. The movie telegraphs it's punches but it's still enjoyable. Ewan McGregor is always a pleasure to watch.

6981746,4,B00SFRHKAI,"Nice surprise.  As a Ewan McGregor fan, I was interested in checking this movie out and was delightfully surprised at how good it was.  McGregor plays a hard core criminal this time, not much ""good guy"" in him at all.  As usual, he was great in the part delivering an ""all in"" performance.yet again.  Good acting all around, good directing, good story.  Young guy (Brenton Thwaites - good actor) goes to prison for a minor crime and, to survive,  gets involved with hardened criminal (McGregor) and his gang for protection.  Protection is not free of course and the plot thickens nicely with lots of turns and twists.  There's a lot to this movie, all handled well by the actors and director Julius Avery (who also wrote the film).  The movie was made in Australia and released in Australia, UK, and Canada.  If you like crime dramas, check this one out.  And yes, there is violence. I'm going to watch it again, just to make sure I didn't miss anything.",1439769600,2,954,4.585798816568047

6982100,4,B00SFRHKAI,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie... I liked the kind of quiet serene mood between action scenes similar to another movie I viewed recently, The Rover.  Granted that the story didn't have a lot of plot twists and turns but that was appealing; so many films these days seem to throw in all sorts of plot changes just to keep the action high.  This movie had action but it was the tension that I could really feel.
I enjoy movies where the cinematography helps set the mood and feeling and I think that this was greatly shown here.  McGregor's gritty portrayal was well received and  Brenton Thwaites character was truly believable.",1435708800,,637,4.660714285714286

6982366,4,B00SFRHKAI,"A must-watch for fans of Ewan McGregor.  While the two younger stars playing the romantic couple in this film fall pretty flat, McGregor gives the somewhat villainous Brendan shades of depth and subtlety that make him a fascinating character, only falling slightly short of Byronic heroism in that he is, after all, a thief.  However, Brendan has a rigorous code of ethics that makes him interesting.  I found the performances by Jacek Koman (Sam) and Matt Nable (Sterlo) similarly nuanced and intriguing, leaving me wondering about the characters' histories together.

The most serious complaint I have is that the story takes entirely too long to establish.  The film is nearly half over before the plot finally realizes its intent to get you invested in the characters' relationships to one another and emotionally involved in what they're doing/why they're doing it.",1433376000,,870,5.185714285714286

There were some slow moments, but overall the pace is good. Ewan is good, and I enjoyed the ratcheting sense of danger. It's not really Ewan's film, regardless of the poster, and the actor who fills the lead role seems competent enough, but he seems to fade when some of the stronger actors are on screen. I think this is intentional to the character, but it is hard to tell, since I don't know much about him. Alicia Vikander does a good job in a smaller role.",1433203200,,584,4.223214285714286

6982575,5,B00SFRHKAI,"The real star of this action packed prison/crime drama is the youthful Aussie actor Brenton Thwaites (Oculus, Blue Lagoon, The Signal, The Giver) who has come a long way from playing pretty boy Prince Phillip in Maleficent. Incarcerated for some petty crime, he avoids being raped and beaten thanks to the help of Ewan McGregor and his fellow criminal buddies. EM takes BT under his protective wing and treats him like a master to student (shades of Episodes II and III of Star Wars). All is being prepared for an eventual prison break to be followed by a lucrative robbery. This is to be done after BT has already been released.  The eventual idea was for BT to join up with EM and his escaped prison buddies to execute the pre-planned crime. Without giving anything away, there are a number of surprises and twists which, along with the constant action, keeps this movie going at a rapid pace. There is also a very human quality to all of this regardless of the lawlessness.  In fact, it ultimately plays a crucial role in the film. BT has been given a moustache which, combined with a shaved head that is retained from his prison days and facial pallor, gives him an older and hardened appearance - highly appropriate for this film.  Indeed, he is able to stand up to EM when necessary. The bond that evolves between these two is an essential feature of the movie.  With two excellent actors as the leads along with an excellent supporting cast (especially Alicia Vikander as the one female representative in the mix), this film is far better than one might initially suspect and makes worthwhile viewing.",1432944000,,1608,4.691489361702128

It's the first time that I has seen these actors perform, and I thought they did an outstanding job in character.

Unfortunately there's a love story between a kid who can't swim and his Russian girlfriend that is such a slog to get through.

The protagonist (some young actor whose name escapes me and career escapes him) who maneuvers around this menagerie of horrors with a blank face and clueless attitude, would have been better cast in a Crocodile Dundee sequel.

6983277,3,B00SFRHKAI,"This is sort of a 'coming of age'/heist thriller mix.  It's always a pleasure to watch Ewan McGregor, who really does a good job as a terrifying felon who springs himself from prison for one more big job.  A better film in this category is Sexy Beast.  Complicating the straightforward heist here is the younger prisoner he brings under his wing, and that prisoner's love interest, the very good Alicia Vikander, who has really come into her own with a great performance in Ex Machina.  The Australian take on its criminal underworld is unusual for me, and convincing.  The film does a very good job playing with the 'honor among thieves' issue and it's worthwhile just to watch those dynamics play out...the strange situation of the war of all against all, and the problem of the cultivation of just enough trust to get by or get yours.  The narrative though doesn't do the best job jugging the coming of age/romance versus the Ewan McGregor heist/thriller.  Not a bad job though, and an unexpected ending.",1431043200,,1007,4.752873563218391

6983315,5,B00SFRHKAI,"There are prison movies and there are heist movies. This one is both. The film starts like many prison movies do, with a green/unseasoned young guy being processed into the culture of a rough prison. At first, the guards seem like what the guy has to worry about -- but soon it's clear that the other prisoners are the problem. Thugs rule on the inside, and the young guy (Brenton Thwaites) does whatever he can to get by. After befriending some guys for protection and an action-packed break out scene, the film becomes a heist movie centered on jacking a gold mine. The heist is pretty great, and there's a nice take on a double-double cross at the end.

Again, you have to be into films in these two genres to like this movie. If you are, I think Ewen McGregor gives a good performance and the film ends with a very nice turn of the screw. Overall, it's very entertaining and provocative.",1431043200,,891,4.466257668711656

Mr. McGregor used his usual ""bully on the block - who also thinks he is charming"" act, punching and yelling, and shooting and punching some more. There is a pause to burn everything and imply brief feelings of emotion, something which none are capable of, because they are all some form of anti-social-ites.  Oh hey, and all with a happy narcissistic ending, and a couple of cons attempting to sail off into the sunset, but not together. Did I mention a truck chase and unrealistic gun spatter AND a helicopter that does NOT crash after a gun fight?
I must attest that after I found out how easily bullets travel through sheet metal, it has become hard for me not to negatively judge run and gun films that ignore known physics completely.

How many of these things do we have to see . . . violence, violence, violence.

6983618,4,B00SFRHKAI,"It just gets better and better. I really liked this film. I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor; he almost always blows my socks off. Even as the rarely played dark, tough guy, he cannot help but be funny, especially in the last third of this film. I like the close up use of frontal view camera tracking shots; they really add to all of the shots in prison. I saw Brenton Thwaites in ""The Signal"", which I did not like very much, and I like sci-fi, etc. I won't get into that film here, as it was not Brenton Thwaites' fault it didn't work for me. However, he is perfectly cast in this film, as is Alicia Vikander, yet another outstanding young Swedish actress (I am nuts about Noomi Rapace), The supporting cast is good (Matt Nable stood out). I definitely think both Brenton Thwaites and Alicia Vikander have terrific careers in front of themselves. Ms. Vikander has already been in several very good films, and landed the starring role in the recently opened ""Ex Machina"".  This a true story; not one of those ""based on such and such"" films. The real criminal this is about is up for parole in 5 years, although he has other charges he can be tried for.",1430006400,,1151,4.3534883720930235

Son of a Gun follows JR (Brenton Thwaites) as he is incarcerated in an Australian prison.  He is soon befriended by Brendon (Ewan McGregor).  Brendon is a BMOC in the cellblock.  As such he puts a ""no touch"" policy on JR.  In return, JR us asked to do certain favors for Brendon while he is still locked up.

Not to ruin a plot and spoil the story and surprises along the way, JR eventually becomes Brendon's BFF and protg.

Young man sent to prison, has to deal with the harsh reality of taking a side to stay alive.  Manipulated by his benifactor inside he has an obligation once he is released.

Tossed into the world of high stakes and big money heist crews he does what he is told but still rebels to show be is his own man.

Muddy the waters with a female character who is in the same obligatory relationship with Mr. Big, or us she?  Action and the love triangle intermixed as the story moves into the big heist.

Makes it enjoyable enough of a time expenditure:
- Passing grade (nothing memorable) action and sex scenes, plot elements, dialog
- Although it falls short of great, it's not bad

Makes it difficult to justify not watching something else instead:
- Somewhat cookie-cutter plot, story flow

Could have been a bit smarter use of masks and identity concealing measures, but I imagine they weren't going for a hi-tech..super thought out heist like Oceans 11 etc.  The only way they could make it better is with a sequel.  One last go for Mr. McGregors character and this time it works out in the end 100%. Change the box art please, he's no Shaolin monk in this.  Also, if another is made...don't replace the cast.  That's always a cheap move and never works out....it leaves people pissed off and disappointed...Even if they manage to pull off the sequel with a different cast...it cheapens it in a bad way.",1429747200,,763,4.375886524822695

6983669,3,B00SFRHKAI,"This was solidly done, but nothing about it really popped out at you. Ewan McGregor is one of my favorite actors since the 1990s, and here he gives a solid performance, but nothing that deserves an award. Some people say that his talent and potential were wasted on this movie, but I disagree. He did a good enough job, but he is one of the actors that needs a great script in order to be great. He has a hard time outshining the script. That being said, he can be an outstanding actor given the right circumstances, and here he does a competent job. The script of ""Son of a Gun"" was good enough for him to do that. Ewan McGregor has taken a whole bunch of characters that were too goody-goody for him. Him doing upbeat cheesy roles is painful to watch (sorry, Ewan!). He does by far the best when he plays out his roughneck Scottish roots. He does best with the Celtic style, angry, yet philosophical roles. This movie allows for some of that, although it's not a hum-dinger.

At the end of the day, this was a nice story about a young man (actor Brenton Thwaites) and his isolation and loneliness against the backdrop of the hard life. The desperate, gritty nature of this life is conveyed well with the production design and the costumes/hair/makeup. The mise en scene portrays this life well. However, maybe I'm just spoiled by American Hollywood movies, but I thought one area that could use a little sprucing up was the budget and the production value. I've gotten used to movies being somewhat expensive looking, and this movie (along with many other Australian movies) just looks a little amateur and cheap. The sound was a little bit off, and the music was not balanced properly against the sound of the scene-the music could be a little loud, in spite of it being very good. In fact, the song selection was one of the better things about this movie.

At the end of the day, though, the plot did not come together perfectly. There were a few moments that were a bit of a stretch, but they (just barely) passed the believability test. Brenton Thwaites does a pretty good job, but is a little bit unexpressive, and doesn't nail it out of the park. He seems a bit wooden, but you can see what he is trying to convey. The story was nice, but a bit cliched in places, and then a bit too much of a stretch in others. The movie rests on a nice foundation of telling the story of a sympathetic character, but the movie on the whole has a few flimsy characteristics that pull it back to three stars. In no way is this a four star movie, yet it rises above being a two star movie as well. Three stars.",1427068800,3,2600,4.380952380952381

Then things begin to get messy. First of all this isn't a bad movie, its just not all that original. The movie did have some really tense and exciting aspects to it but it seemed dull and uninspired at times. I was not expecting something amazing from this but I really started to lose interest a few times and by the end I was just glad it was finally over. There were enough twists to make me keep watching but they were pretty predictable. Overall, nothing all that original or exciting but seeing Ewan McGregor in a role like this is the reason to give it a shot. I give it a C.",1426464000,16,888,4.323353293413174
6983687,4,B00SFRHKAI,"Although the film is shot across quite a number of locations and movie sets, which would have cost a bit, overall the film Son of a Gun has a very low budget look to it which sort of makes it feel a bit more real than your big budget US jail and crime caper based plot movies. Ewan McGregor is also probably the only actor you'd recognise, although he's a rough looking version of his normal appearance. The fact there's no other recognisable faces leads a bit more believability to the characters simply being who they are and your not just seeing them as this or that actor playing a role, like unfortunately a lot of Australian crime films do.  Being unknowns doesn't mean they don't do a good job though, the other main character played by Brenton Thwaites is quite believable as a young imprisoned man who is taken under the wing of McGregor who is criminal gang leader both inside and outside of prison. Since JR (Thwaites) has a short release date, McGregor has quite the plan for him, in exchange for keeping him safe behind bars. The other prison inmate actors, are quite convincing too.  A Russian victim of people smuggling forced into a life she can't escape is also well played by Swedish born Alicia Vikander.

The film uses a simple escape plan, I won't mention what it is but if you doubt it could have had any possibility of working, it's actually based on a real life event in Australia that did.  The film also has quite a unique police chase in it as part of a crime caper in the outback using four wheel drives driven in a way city soccer mums don't drive them.",1426377600,15,1582,4.426116838487973
6983688,3,B00SFRHKAI,"Throughout the whole movie I kept thinking about Ewan McGregor portraying Obi Wan in Star Wars, and how a much darker, more complicated character would have suited Obi Wan, instead of the cardboard good guy he was made out to be by Lucas.  How the character Ewan portrays in this movie would have made a compelling Obi Wan, and how Brenton Thwaites would have made a great Anakin, and how Alicia Vikander, well, you get my point.  This movie is ok for a crime drama, but what made me keep watching it was the echoes of what the Star Wars prequels could have been, instead of the gummy bear versions we got.

The bad guys can be happy with ""their"" futures, while the families of the dead left in their wake will suffer forever.
