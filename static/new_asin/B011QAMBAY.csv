8724918,5,B011QAMBAY,"Shifu Roger Hagood breaks down the Loose Hands Two Man form.  The material is broken down into smaller segment in order to not only teach it but to show applications.

There are two sides to the form and once you have learned both the offense and defensive sides, you can then start your true training.

Material on South Mantis is usually like legs on snakes, very rare to find.  I applaud Shifu Hagood for his devotion and dedication to preserving and documenting South Mantis Kung Fu.",1446076800,,487,4.627906976744186
