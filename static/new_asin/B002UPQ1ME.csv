8381423,5,B002UPQ1ME,"This movie, while being sad in the sense that what happened to him was sad, he endured and was able to write a book concerning his dilemma.",1380585600,,139,4.185185185185185
8381424,3,B002UPQ1ME,"Australian-released, ""Locked-in syndrome""(1) is accomplished with ""Mr. MICHAEL'S DOG""(2) ""Otaru""(3).

1. A story of paralysed intellectual communicating with the world with blinking an eye and thanks to a patience, love and time spent daily by a wife near his bedside. Lucky one having such sacrificing a life and own health spouse
2. A mostly unemployed artist-or-whatever begs scrapes for his dog imaginary to survive-and life bites as neighbours presented him an animal real, hungry for its meat itself. Also a jacket informs, that this is autobiographic work, not much is being initiated with allegories
3. Mostly in Japanese (even without French subtitles, no English at all) rather a doco is factually the longest-running feature on a disc. As understood, it tells of cultural specific not translatable into western margins, dealt with obsession with fetishism and sex involving the under-aged.

8381425,3,B002UPQ1ME,"Very interesting subject matter.  The actual movie ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is better.  A must-see for anyone in the health care field as it shows the thoughts of a patient who cannot communicate in the normal way.",1355875200,,225,4.743589743589744
8381426,5,B002UPQ1ME,"What can I say?
A video of a tragedy?  Or a video of a work of love?
I read and saw ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"", and a friend made me aware of this video.  It was interesting and moving.  A rare glimpse into another world.",1334707200,,230,3.851063829787234
