8021335,5,B00023J4EI,"Charming children and adults get into fun predicaments.

If you liked ""Little House on the Prairie"" or ""Anne of Green Gables""; you should like this. Seasons 1-6 are excellent.

Beautiful scenery, period costumes and sets, pretty dresses, farm, horses, a little humor, realistic characters, likeable characters, lively pace, and inviting activities, carry you to a nicer place.

Michael York guest-stars in one episode as a mysterious, former sea captain in search of buried treasure. The episode, ""Old Quarrels, Old Love"", about the rivalry and friendship of Rachel Lynde and Hetty King has an excellent ending that is subtle and touching; without words, yet moving. The episode when Sarah's cousin comes to visit; famous stage actress, Miss Pigeon Plumtree, has subtle melodramatic humor. There is lots of humor in another episode where Sarah leads Felicity to believe she was switched at birth with a girl of a poor family.

Mr. Sullivan spared no expense to create warm and humorous escapades.

This series has been my best money value; dividing the 13-episodes by the cost: $5113 episodes = $3.92 per 46-minute episode. Sells new in Canada for $80.",1175731200,2,1152,5.172043010752688
8021336,5,B00023J4EI,"I just received my purchase of Road to Avonlea: Season 2.  I grew up watching this show on the Disney channel.  Every Monday at eight I was there.  I forgot just how touching these episodes really were.  I truly appreciate them far better than I used to.  My favorite episode of this season will always be ""Sara's Homecoming."" In this episode, Sara is kidnapped by Isis the fortune teller's husband.  Now, I remember watching this episode as a kid, and I waited impatiently all week from viewing ""Next time on Avonlea"" commercials. It did not let me down when viewed.  Not all sites mention this episode as a favorite, I find that odd, but then again, it is my favorite.  It is full of drama, comedy, and a little suspense.  I don't think you could ask for more from a show.  Another great episode is ""A mother's love."" I'm sorry, but nobody could not shed at least one heartwarming tear during that episode.  Good season altogether, and highly recommended by this viewer.",1168819200,2,972,4.593023255813954
8021337,5,B00023J4EI,I loved watching this show on Canadian TV when I was younger and was thrilled to find out it was on DVD. A word of advice to anyone thinking of buying it - don't buy it here. The price is great but only if you actually receive the DVD. It's been 20 days since my credit card was charged and I'm still waiting for a response from the seller as to where the DVD is. I plan on buying the other seasons but will gladly pay extra and get them directly from sullivanboutique.com (where I got the first complete season in 5 days).,1140825600,2,523,4.087378640776699
8021338,5,B00023J4EI,"This great family-friendly series brings back great memories from my childhood; I would definitely consider this my favorite TV show of all time! Each episode is full of sweet moments, family life, exciting adventures, beautiful scenery, and much more. The content of these is minimal: it's a very family-friendly series, with only a few episodes with some objectionable content (like the Witches of Avonlea episode in this season).

The storyline centers around Sarah Stanley, who comes to Prince Edward Island when her father is accused of embezzlement to live with relatives in a little town called Avonlea. As she struggles to accept her new life and get along with her strict Aunt Hettie, her stuck-up cousin Felcity King, & tormenting cousin Felix King, Sarah must accept the changes in her young life. But not everything is bad: small town life can be loads of fun, and her new Aunt Olivia is wondeful!

Check out this amazing series produced by Sullivan in Canada, the same company who brought up ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Anne of Avonlea"" in the 90's with Megan Follows. Aired in the U.S. under the title ""Avonlea"" on the Disney Channel, you will enjoy watching these fantastic episodes again and again! My favorite episodes from this season include: ""How Kissing Was Discovered,""  ""May the Best Man Win,"" and ""It's Just a Stage""...

Season Two contains the following episodes:

1. Sara's Homecoming
2. How Kissing Was Discovered
3. Aunt Hetty's Ordeal
4. Of Corsets and Secrets and True True Love
5. Old Quarrels, Old Love
6. May the Best Man Win
7. Family Rivalry
8. Sea Ghost
9. All That Glitters
10. Dreamer of Dreams
11. It's Just a Stage
12. A Mother's Love
13. Misfits and Miracles",1132185600,15,1699,4.844827586206897
