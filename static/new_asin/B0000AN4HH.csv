7997759,4,B0000AN4HH,I have been interested in PT Boats and WWII for a long time. I read the book in search of PT 109 and wanted to see the video. It was a Christmas gift and I was very happy with it. The Search for the Bismark and the ships off of Guadalcanal were very good as well.,1233360000,2,263,3.7142857142857144

7997761,4,B0000AN4HH,"I own all of the shipwreck series and I like them all.  Except the PT 109 episode.  A PT boat is tiny and the remains they find are like finding a pop can in the ocean.  The history side of JFK is fine, but the effect at the end was like finding a lost fishing boat in the Mississippi River.  Yippee.  The others in this series are great.",1189036800,3,338,3.911764705882353
