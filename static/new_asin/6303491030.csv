664670,5,6303491030,"This is a Hitchcockian suspense film. How can a social climber who marries a rich heiress get rid of her to seize her fortune ? He uses the services of a professional killer, in this case a woman, Mrs Schindler, a German woman. Simone Signoret is a marvelous professional killer. The wife is made crazy, little by little, with the help of a delivery boy who likes playing games. This boy, this accessory to the final crime, is in fact turned into a haunting ghost taunting the woman into a crazy killing reaction. The boy thinks he is playing a trick on her and that the bullets will be blanks, but they are no blanks and he is killed, assassinated. The woman is thus captured by the police and the husband gets his hands on her fortune. He sells at once all he can sell in order to go to foreign countries and live on his prize. But his professional accomplice is a professional killer and thus she has the last word and captures the spoils of the action. The details are in the film. Simone Signoret is marvelous, even if she has a French accent, rather than a German accent. She is of course an allusion, nowadays, to another film due to her name. Mrs Schindler. But she does not save lives. She executes people in order to get a profit out of it. If you want to kill your wife, never get in touch with professionals because you are an amateur and amateurs are always the victims of professionals. And never drink anything presented to you by your professional accomplices. As for the plot, it is very imaginative and creative. Hitchcock himself could not have done better.

These are so well played by excellent actors, (Katherine Ross and James Caan just getting their starts) and the mesmerizing lady with the secret behind her secrets with her bee-stung eyes (Simone Signoret).  I searched for this for years and am so glad to be able to view it again with its innuendos and ""games"", trying to ferret out which ""games' are real and which are simple teases, only later to turn into something real at ever deeper depths.

664845,3,6303491030,"I remember seeing ""Games"" when it was first released in the theaters.  I really liked the film until about half way through, when I realized that this was just an American take-off of the great French thriller, ""Diabolique.""  It was because this became so obvious by the half-way mark - the film was ruined for me as the outcome was so clear.  Oh, they threw in one last surprise - but it was really a let down (and a bad attempt to fool us ""Diabolique"" fans.)  So, if you've seen ""Diabolique,"" don't bother unless you want to see how to rework a film not for the better.  And, for Heaven's sake, don't even think of watching the American remake of ""Diabolique,"" as it is truely horrible.  If you haven't seen ""Diabolique,"" then go ahead and watch ""Games.""  But I would really suggest getting the Criterion ""Diaboloque"" and settling down to a real classic thriller.

It's a feast for the eyes as the weird characters indulge in perverse occult-y moves in their lavishly decored home. Stars Simone Signoret, Katharine Ross and James Caan. There were complaints about the first pressing that it was either suffering from pixellation or speeding up in the final moments. This has been corrected, but I have to say the movie still looks very grainy as if shot through a gauze curtain, but this may well be the way it always looked in cinemas.

664930,4,6303491030,"[GAMES - (1967) - Widescreen - directed by Curtis Harrington]  I was unfamiliar with this title, but the cast intrigued me enough to give it a stab, and I was pleased I took the plunge. James Caan and Katherine Ross play an affluent, eccentric couple who engage in peculiar activities to amuse themselves, some of which are occult based without having real ties or connections to actual dark magics.  Performed more for kicks and staged to entertain guests held at soirees at their incredibly atmospheric 60's decorated home, which is prominently featured throughout the film and which adds a distinct element of the surreal necessary to make the movie a success.

Enter Simone Signoret, a tarot reader and pseudo-psychic who sells cosmetics, who engrains herself into the couple's lifestyle, and soon moves in and adds newfound mystery to an already ambiguous household. Soon enough, there is an unspoken ""Let the games begin"" aura of cat and mouse as mystery, mayhem, murder and madness become the houses' New Order. Bewitching in its execution, it's entertaining right 'till the end credits roll.

Simone Signoret steals the show, Katherine Ross is fine as the frazzled housewife but, surprisingly, James Caan is the film's weak link as far as the acting goes - he's no more than adequate, and his role could have been portrayed by almost anyone else with the same conviction. True, it's an early role for him, but none of the fire of his 70's creations are displayed here. No matter, the film is still extremely entertaining as a 60's timepiece of murder mystery, and very much a by-product of 1967 sensibilities, which worked wonders for me. Oh sure, if you think hard while watching you can deduce what the probable outcome will be, but if you're content to sit back and let the amusement unfold, you're in for a treat. Enjoy the 'Games'.",1322697600,7,1844,4.881789137380192
664931,5,6303491030,"Katharine Ross and a pre-'Godfather' James Caan star as a married couple that love games. Strange, occult, imaginative ones. Simone Signoret is an Avon Lady that stops in and ends up staying. Enter 'Norman', a delivery man who is strongly attracted to Ross. The couple think it funny to freak Norman out and shoot him, thus starting a new game that isn't much fun anymore.

A favorite since 1969, this movie has been hard to find for years. Katharine Ross is a pleasure to watch, and James Caan is interesting, knowing what a performance he is capable of as Sonny Corleone just three years later. Simone Signoret, always a star, gives a mystique to the film. More substance in this than many ""thrillers"" made today.",1317945600,7,715,4.72
664932,4,6303491030,"I am with the other reviewers here, this classic is great...but the DVD messes up at about 1hr, 32min. into the movie. Universal needs to fix this problem, because this movie is great when you can see it in its original widescreen Techniscope aspect ratio (back when they made ""real"" widescreen movies). The video quality is ok for DVD-R, until the picture ""speeds up"" near the end. It's like it is time compressed for some reason? Who knows, who cares! Just fix the problem because I doubt this will ever be a ""legit"" pressing from Universal. These DVD-Rs are usually limited, so if you are a fan of this classic mystery, get it! Even with the mess up near the end, it is great to have a copy of this on widescreen DVD after all these years. They sure don't make movies like this anymore...

I can now heartily recommend it to fans of the film.  The pixilation that marred the final chapter has been corrected.

But the final chapter succumbs to a weird ""speed-up"" effect at about the 1:33 mark, with the actors jerking about (I tried it on two Sony players).

664935,5,6303491030,"A couple is fascinated by games in this suspenseful and well-acted thriller that does not disclose its plot until the end. Katherine Ross, a very rich woman, is married to James Caan, who has no money of his own. One day Katherine is visited by a very likeable woman, Simone Signoret, who becomes sick during the visit. Katherine tells her she can stay at the house until she is well. Simone tells the couple that while they enjoy games, she suggests that they play more macabre games, those that could end up with death. They agree. The initial games involve an apparent shooting, a deceptive beating by the husband of his wife, and a seeming scene of adultery where the surprised husband almost kills the adulterer. The husband then suggests that they play a trick on the man who took part in the apparent adultery. But it goes wrong. While there were supposed to be blanks in the gun, there were real bullets and the man is killed. The husband tells his wife that they need to cover up the murder. The body is removed but the wife sees blood where it should not be and has a vision of the killed man. What is going on? Who is the female guest?",1306368000,,1146,4.410377358490566

That said, I can still see the kitchen: was there a dutch door...and a service elevator? Oh yeah, there certainly was a service elevator, yikes! Seems like there was a balcony overhanging the living room? I could be wrong, but I think there was xmas tree in the final scene, or maybe a blinking flashlight.

The price of this video is too steep for me, but I am very tempted.

664938,5,6303491030,"Curtis Harrington's ""Games"" is an overlooked gem to say the least. How could a movie that stars James Caan, Katherine Ross, and Simone Signoret not be mentioned nowadays much less have a proper release? (It's still only available as a VHS and bootlegs).

This has great performances, a story within a story, and a nice twist. Caan and Ross play two socialites who play a couple of mind and magic games to their guest. One of their games goes horrible wrong when they shoot the delivery boy, Norman.

All this coincides with the arrival of a mystery woman named Ms. Schindler. Caan is great. He showed even at this early age of his career acting muscle. Ross I've never seen a terrible performance from her. She is so beautiful and innocent in her movies, you can believe any part she plays.

7848806,5,6303491030,"When I was an American boy growing up in France, the actress Simone Signoret, still in her forties, popped up continually on French TV, while the feature pages of Paris-Match were always writing up tragedies suffered by the talented, Oscar -winning star.  We children were deathly afraid of her.  We would scream when we saw her visage, with a sick pleasure, for just as Catherine Deneuve was the face of Marianne in France, Signoret represented a scary monster type of evil.  Our nanny encouraged our fear by telling us matter-of-factly that if we did not behave, Simone Signoret was going to come to our rooms at night and eat us.  One look at that smeary, sad, voracious face would make a wise man believe she had teeth, and in Games (1967) she uses them in what is perhaps her best Hollywood part.  Director Curtis Harrington had originally written the part of Lisa Schindler for Marlene Dietrich, but that producers told him Dietrich was box office poison at Universal, nix on Dietrich.  What a shame, but at least now we have the spectacle of Simone Signoret giving a long, detailed, extended Marlene Dietrich impression.  And much else besides!  I look at the movie now, years removed from my TV terror at Signoret in Games, and I see how beautifully Harrington shows us a glossy, moody Upper East Side New Yorkconstructed solely from standing sets on the Universal lotin a time of changing morals and an exploding plastic inevitable.  Partygoers snicker at the Op and Pop art glaring at them from the old brownstone interiors.  Paul picks it out, says one dryly, then Jenny pays for it.

Theyre bored and rich and kinky. How kinky?  She peels off his fake mustache after he kisses her, and applies it herself, returning his kiss and making him feel the way a woman feelsshades of Rusty and Myra in Myra Breckinridge, more subdued than the rape of Rusty, true, but anticipating something of its genderbending swagger.  The interior decor makes me swoon: its hasty, but fullhearted embrace (pastiche?) of Lichtenstein, George Segal, Bridget Riley, Paul Thek, Stella and Warhol, Yves Klein, this hurriedly copied d&eacute;cor (almost as if they sent Elaine Sturtevant into Leo Castelli for an hour, then twitched her out and had her copy everything she saw all over the walls of a brownstone), overlaid with primitive brass masks and panniers, and vintage pinball machines &agrave; la Jack Spicer, dates this picture precisely in 1967, though period music cues are strangely absent.  (Maybe Curtis Harrington didn't care that much about music, although one knows from his later work he loved child stars tap dancing.)  But in Games the non-rock soundtrack makes it all the easier to take in one fabulous wig after another on Katharine Rosss lovely head and to marvel at how tiny James Caans eyes are.  How cute he is, like a small doll.  Next to him the hunky grocery boy played by Don Stroud comes off as a toplooks like Fred Halsted in fact with his sulky gaze, enormous lips, big nipples like shell casings.  One strange thing about Games is that, usually when movies are laid in Manhattan, scriptwriters take pains to avoid giving exact addresses (Rosemarys Baby, for example, is set at the fictional Bramford Apartments, though it sure looks like the actual Dakota!).  But Paul and Jenny Montgomery live at 11 East 64th Street, and maybe some of you do too, its a real address right off the park, cozy between Fifth and Madison.  You can look it up on Google Maps or Google Earth, and wonder!  To sum it up, Games is like Wait Until Dark with Audrey Hepburn blind, except Katharine Ross isn't blind, or if Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf was played with a pair of antique dueling pistols.  Its about the silly, kinky, addictive love games that Foucault told us were the first new sex act invented in over 2,500 years.  With Ross, Caan and Signoret, totally disguised in wax doll masks, prepare an elaborate human sacrifice to shock the family attorney, its like some sort of grim but chic sitcom set in Thelema Abbey.",1471996800,3,4025,4.784682080924855

I kept hoping that Katherine wasn't really naive to the point of being just this side of brain-dead, but alas, such was not the case. (Astute readers can fill in the rest of the plot just from that statement.) Add to that a phoned-in performance by James Caan, a totally wasted Estelle Winwood, and far too many close-ups of s-l-o-w-l-y turning doorknobs and other cliches, and I have to wonder why this is so highly rated.
