7920896,1,B00004RF6Y,"Pretty lame, no, make that very lame, soft core erotica from Pride Video.  Apparently the folks at Pride solicited letters from viewers detailing their experiences in love, lust and obsession.  They were inundated, so they said, with responses.  They chose the best to dramatize.  If these four stories were the best, I pity the Pride people for having to sift through the mountain of rejects they received.

None of the stories is particularly interesting.  A gay kid falls in love with the supposedly straight Big Man on Campus.  An apparently straight guy is shocked and titillated when he discovers his apparently straight best friend/roommate in bed with another man.  A rent boy with a heart of gold falls in love with one of his johns.  And, in the marginally best story, a closeted man becomes obsessed with his father's gardener.  Yawn!

I can't say much about the actors, since they never get a chance to say anything, let alone act. An extremely irritating narrator does a voiceover during the entire movie.  ""Jerry said this"", or ""Tim said that"", or ""Daniel says he never knew true love before"", or ""Tom says it was the most incredible experience he ever had"".  Almost as annoying as the narrator was the musical score.  Shot directly to video, the photography and sound are bad, as is just about every other aspect of this movie.

I made the mistake of watching this one right after seeing the science fiction/horror classic ""The Killer Shrews"".  Hmmm.  Which movie is better, ""Mad About the Boy"", or ""The Killer Shrews""?  ""Killer Shrews"" wins hands down!  At least that one was entertaining.",1317168000,,1605,4.856088560885609
