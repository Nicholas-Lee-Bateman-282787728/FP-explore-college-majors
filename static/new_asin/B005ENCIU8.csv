8468764,5,B005ENCIU8,"And if you're a Jackie Cooper fan & a fan of these golden oldies, you should get this DVD.  Jackie Cooper is Larry Kelly, class student up for valedictorian. The return of Larry's reformed gangster father threatens his standing in the community after a couple of newspaper reporters spot Larry's father in tow while he's driving the new car his dad bought for him as Larry's graduation present. An article disclosing the detailed events of Larry's father's gangster days appear in the newspaper the following morning & it sets the tone for this story.

Regarding the DVD quality, there are quite a few skips in dialogue as a result of the film needing some restoration.  The print obviously is within the public domain.  It seems as though these are the only prints in circulation for the time being, so it's better than nothing for the moment.  If & when Gangster's Boy is finally given an official release with deserving prints to do it justice, I'll be quick in the que to obtain my copy.  However, this is a delightful relic of its time, so the Alpha DVD is happily in my collection.",1316908800,,1087,4.635416666666667
