8226752,3,B000X25FOQ,"I'm a big Roger Raglin fan, and I enjoy almost all of his videos. This is by far one of my least favorite he has put out. With the title ""Biggest Whitetail Bucks In The World', I was expecting a majestic hunting video featuring giant deer and where to find them.
This basically included a hunting segement in Canada that Roger Raglin was hardly in. Featured many other hunters and the utlization of deer drives. There were some nice deer in the video, yet nothing I would consider ""Biggest in the World"". The video was somewhat of a let down, lots of unnecessary footage, and very little information. The video was basically of one area in Canada, and multiple hunters shooting deer in the area. For Roger Raglin fans, I would not recommend buying this one unless you are just a die hard fan that wants to own something Roger appears in.",1416960000,,837,4.5131578947368425
