3882396,1,B0029Z8KC4,Judi Bowkers picture is on front of Season Two and  she is listed as an actress but she is not in any episode. Very inferior to the first year. Do not buy.,1300492800,,155,3.84375
3882397,3,B0029Z8KC4,"While this is a lovely old TV series, Season 2 does not star Judi Bowker as advertised. I purchased series 1 and 2 because I am a Judi Bowker fan. It's hard to say who is to blame for the bad information on this item. The artwork on the disc has a picture of Judi Bowker but doesn't mention her name anywhere on the outside of the case. Both series are advertised by Amazon as starring Judi Bowker. It's a nice enough series but still--where's Judi?",1292976000,,449,4.232558139534884
3882398,5,B0029Z8KC4,"First of all let me state for the record that it's the DVD I am reviewing.

Okay, I have to say that the original film hasn't been cleaned up in any way,
just a very poor transfer of picture quality, the sound is on a par with the state of the picture.
 The colours are washed out, the definition of the image is bad, too. However
the negatives stop there. The positives far outweigh them. Starting with the brief
episode intro before we are whisked along on the wings of the marvellous theme
tune which is (to me anyway) majestic, inspiring, powerful and yet at the same time
hinting of hardship and suffering but still achingly good as the star of the series, Black Beauty
 makes himself look as he should, muscular, lithe and very swift indeed, simply brilliant.

The stories themselves have a strong sense of moral values, the struggles of the Gordon
family presided over by Doctor Gordon with deftness, good judgement, wit and common sense.
The kind of man you wish your father could have been or perhaps still can be with a little
work! The kids are fun, boisterous, impulsive, stupid and willful but full of character and you
can see their parents' decent characters shining through in the end.

The series is still epic, my kids are enjoying the episodes day after day and return from
school with a ""Can we watch Black Beauty now?"" There's so much to enjoy in these
programs and it is incredible that each and every story accomplishes such a lot in such
a short time. One show of Black Beauty is worth two of any modern similar type dramas.
The production values are excellent and the cast deliver the goods time after time from
the main characters all of whom are charming in their own typically quirky ways through
to the supporting cast. Young or old, the lucky ones who were fortunate to be in this
masterpiece are carry each and every story through to its conclusion having you begging
for more.

All credit for this goes of course to the author, Jane Sewell who crafted these awe-inspiring
treats first for her readers and then through the screenplay writers and producers, horse handlers
who managed to make Black Beauty virtually human for us viewers to enjoy. I cannot sing the
praises of this series enough. Whether you are owners or just fans of horses this series although
made for children is equally suited to be viewed by adults, in fact the whole family can sit down
together and just be blown away by the way it all comes together so apparently effortlessly. The
love and care with which this show has been put together is palpable.

In a nutshell, choose another colour if you wish but there is only one..

Black and it IS a Beauty!!!!!",1272067200,3,2662,4.566037735849057

It is a set of lovely situations with nice messages about love to the nature and persons and off course to animals like the horse Black Beauty. It is a nice opportunity to enjoy this TV series of 70s, hard to see in this days on TV.",1315180800,,483,4.318681318681318
