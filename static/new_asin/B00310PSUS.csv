A little preachy, but good.",1407456000,,47,4.875
8386455,1,B00310PSUS,"I don't usually write reviews of films since I realize that this is a very subjective medium especially of this genre.  However, I had to review this if just to help other buyers from wasting their money.  If only I had read the Amazon review as well as other buyer's reviews more carefully.  I read them again and wondered...did I have a brain fart while ordering this?  The Amazon review states...""Aside from these strong features, the film itself is a little bit of a mess"".  A little bit of a mess is a huge understatement!  And what ""strong features""?

First, I will tell you what this film is not;  NOT....funny, interesting, historical, nostolgic, informative, well acted, well directed and produced, musically interesting, sexy, titallating, or erotic.  I'm sure there is more adjectives I could come up with but I would rather not waste any more time referring to this film.

I will tell you what it IS though:  A waste of money at any cost as well as your viewing time.  Avoid!!!",1317600000,2,989,4.686046511627907
8386456,2,B00310PSUS,"The hippies are pissed off because ""the man"" makes them wear clothes and shower, and won't let them smoke dope, so ""the man"" puts a fence around the hippies to keep them away from the public, and the hippies break down the fence and go skinny dipping. Sounds great right? It's NOT, there is a good deal of hippie nudity, and the music is pretty good,  but the acting, story, dialogue, direction, and editing, are all pitiful. I found the whole mess painfully boring, I wish I could go back in time and slap whoever is responsible for producing this heap of nonsensical garbage, or at least get my money and time I wasted on it back.",1284249600,,632,4.401709401709402
8386457,3,B00310PSUS,"Gold is a hard title to label or categorize, but that doesn't mean that it's not a unique film. Viewers can expect a ""bizarre and beautiful journey into the mind and madness of the late 1960s - one overflowing with fantasies of revolution, recreation and raunchy free love."" The films soundtrack runs perfectly with the ridiculousness and features unreleased music from the MC5.

The only trouble is it's very easy to get lost in all of the craziness and lose the purpose or any form of plot elements. At some point during your first time watching you're going to be very confused and then wonder why there are so many naked girls. Gold is still a one-of-a-kind movie experience that should be commended for its return and ability to woe viewers.",1282262400,,746,4.694656488549619
