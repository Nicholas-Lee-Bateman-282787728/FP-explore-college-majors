3496948,5,B001BP14JO,"ok, so yeti, big-foot, abominable snow man, whatever you want to call him he is a star.
This movie made me laugh in a way that was uncomfortable. It was over the top, gory, and totally unpredictable. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch bad movie and laugh. (although this is not a bad movie) Its amazing",1220572800,4,319,4.333333333333333
3496949,5,B001BP14JO,"I was blessed with the opportunity to see an early edit of this film, and was blown away by its creativity and ability to master the conventional Genre Motifs while inventing a new way to tell a B Horror Flick.

Not for the weak stomach viewers, but if you enjoy fun films this is a must see.

Let loose, purchase a great ""Soon To Be"" Cult Classic.",1219190400,4,348,4.17910447761194
8284068,5,B001BP14JO,Just did a double feature of this and the sequel that came out yesterday.  Yeti a Love Story is incredibly funny if you like bad movies. It's actually one of my favorites. The sequel is even better though.,1487116800,,205,4.394736842105263

8284070,2,B001BP14JO,"Totally in line with Troma flicks. Some college kids are going camping, run into a yeti cult and the yeti and one of the college kids fall in love. There's some violence, jumbled story lines and the ending may lead to a sequel with the male perhaps being pregnant by the yeti. The again this came out in '07 so the chances of a sequel are narrowing.

Slight skin, horrid acting, some violence, yeti sex (some consensual, some not) some blood & gore. Lloyd Kaufman (Troma head) does an intro that seems like he is really running on creative fumes. There are some extras on the DVD, but slim compared to some of Troma's early releases.",1478217600,,633,4.456896551724138
8284071,2,B001BP14JO,"Horribly paced and not very well acted, I don't think this was one of Troma's best efforts. I love B movies, but I want them to fun. While this film might sound interesting I found it boring. I kept checking to see how much running time was left.

This film also is quite expensive. I don't think its worth the price to buy it.",1469404800,,327,4.109375

8284073,5,B001BP14JO,"This movie changed the way I look at film & cinema. I honestly feel like a door opened in my mind. I have shared it with others, & it is either accepted as a comedy gem-load, or too unwieldy to grasp for the fragile mind.

Very funny dialogue. Great cast of actors. Yeti cultists. Mashed potatoes. Great soundtrack. Lots of lube.

A true piece of comedy art that needs re-released with extras & possibly a yeti fur cover.",1424304000,2,421,4.384615384615385
8284074,1,B001BP14JO,"Words can not describe how stupid this movie is. Im incredibly sad 73 minutes of my life is wasted. There is not plot line and it's shockingly like a cannibalistic, homosexual, beastiality  trainwreck.",1364860800,,201,5.090909090909091
8284075,4,B001BP14JO,"If you know a twisted person who likes man on man romance and corny humor, this is the perfect gift.",1298246400,4,100,4.05
8284076,4,B001BP14JO,"This movie is EXACTLY what you expect from Troma - gross out humor, bad acting, and a script that's so F'ed up that it all works. If you want Raising Arizona, then rent Raising Arizona. I swear some people here seem to watch movies they know they won't like just to vent their personal lives with their reviews. If you thought Toxic Avenger could have used a little more d**k humor, well, actually more d**k period, then this is the movie for you. If you're a gay fan of gross out humor and z grade movies, then this is for you. If you've ever been turned on by a Yeti...Umm, I digress. This is a film made for fans of Troma, plain and simple. If that's not you, don't watch, don't review, just leave the rest of us alone! and maybe get a life?",1295913600,8,744,4.173611111111111

If your into disgusting bathroom humor that involves vomiting, lots of oozing fake blood, externalized fake intestines, drugs, boring/predictable/ignorant/juvenile dialog and behavior, very poor special effects, then this movie just might appeal to you.  The camera work is very shaky at the start, and the mask and costume of the Yeti is so obviously fake, as most of the effects are.

I read 4 reviews prior to purchasing this turkey that rated this movie at 4 and 5 stars, and that's why I thought that this might be worth a look, against my better judgment.  If you have any reservations, think about it ... at the time that I'm writing this there are almost 10 times more DVDs of this movie available, opposed to the number of reviews written.  Hopefully this saves you some time, money, and frustration.",1245715200,5,958,5.625
