2481232,5,B000E1P3DY,"In my opinion this opera presents difficulties that often literally drag it down, making for what seems like a long evening.  Ironically a performance in a barn with two pianos instead of an orchestra gave me a clue as to what is needed from the orchestra.  The two pianists were superb and knew how to switch from the overall legato nature of the score to a very dramatic marcato in all the right spots.  Sometimes four hands can bring out things dramatically that fail to materialize with an orchestra.

Welser-Moest  has fully grasped the dramatic  need for a variety of orchestral colors, tempi, rubato and dynamics in a way that is far superior to other performances of Cosi.  The Zurich orchestra responds with verve and precision .  Even if all else failed, this alone would make this a notable recording that would be studied by music students for decades, just as people still try to analyze  Furtwaengler`s conducting.  Even though this is the most complete Cosi I have heard it does not seem long.  Conducting is much superior (in my opinion) to Fritz Busch in 1935 and 1950.  Karl Boehm had excellent singers in 1955 but was too slow, until the last scene, to hold my attention.  Muti at La Scala also had an excellent cast in 1988, yet in my opinion his conducting while very good, just does not catch fire to the extent this one does.  I recall listening to one with Schwarzkopf, but not finding it worth buying.  There were others I borrowed from libraries that were not memorable at all.

Fortunately the singing is on the same high level as the conducting,  with excellent ensemble performances.  Although the acting is superb as well, things get a bit hyper here and there.  When the camera follows some of the foolish ""side show"" rather than the singer who is singing, it detracts to some extent.  The extra action is for the most part amusing and at times adds something.  Having almost all of Hartelius's recordings I find her trill, in this  performance, to be less beautiful than in her previous recordings.  Fiordiligi is ,in my opinion, a bit outside Her fach, so this is a minor fault that is offset by her wonderful insights into the role.  She still is a great Fiordiligi equal to my favorite, Sena Jurinac on the 1950 vintage 78 rpm excerpt disks from Glyndbourne, which have been poorly transferred to CD.  Jurinac does no better with the trills in my opinion.  Likwise I recall that Lisa Della Casa cut some notes short to save breath in the 1955 recording with Boehm.

Javier Camerena is a great Ferrando and his act two duet with Hartelius is fantastic.  I just hope he does not burn out soon as so many new tenors do.  Jankova turns in her best performance yet as Despina, she has a good voice and tons of energy, no one else I have heard has done so much with the role.  Her Zerlina and Susanna are wonderful as well.  Like Hartelius she is very dedicated to the Zurich ensemble, building experience rather than instant hype.  The remaining singers are excellent too.

Sound quality in LPCM mode (5.1 not tested) is excellent for the most part.  Unlike other  Zurich DVDs the voices have been panned left or right to match the picture.  Most of the time this works very well, but on AKG K 240 or K 271 studio headphones some stereo image instability is audible here and there.  A strange ""burbling"" sound is sometimes audible when the bassoon and or lower strings are prominent and the music is soft,  voices are not affected.  This most likely is a problem with the digital mixing circuits, as this is what uncorrected digital data errors sometime sound like.  Listening on typical speakers one will likely not hear this.  It might be audible on some large high end speakers, like the large Genelec made in Finland (office in Natick MASS) in a near perfect listening room.  At around $14000/pair I don't own these and I only know one person who has heard them.  Affordable speakers in an average room smear these defects out of existence, along with the finer details in the music.

I feel that it is better to explain the new tragic ending in detail rather than let people jump to conclusions.  In chapter 29 disc 2 Guglielmo is holding a glass of wine,  He is singing about how He wished that the women were drinking poison,  He sees a bottle of poison that belongs to Don Alfonso and drinks his wine before the others drink theirs.  Next Guglielmo refills his glass with the poison and places it where Fiordiligi will pick it up.  Near the end of the finale Fiordiligi starts to collapse, dropping dead after her final note.  Hartelius does this brilliantly and musically nothing has been changed.

It has always bothered me that after all the abuse that is heaped on the two sisters, that everything is resolved so quickly.  For those of us who have read about sociology experiments, sometimes performed in university basements, the original ending seems too simple.  Mozart and De Ponte, In my opinion, have created a wonderful example of how these experiments can go wrong.  This is what college age men today do, when given the freedom to subjugate others, or worse, are told to do harmful things to others, by an authority figure.  Again the new ending fixes the simplistic ending in a clever way. Which I admit will cause others to rebel.",1277942400,8,5283,4.634698275862069
2481233,4,B000E1P3DY,"Arthaus' new release of Cosi Fan Tutte has scored a first as regards completeness; every aria is included even No. 24, Ah lo veggio which was usually cut in most CD (and LP) releases; recits were usually cut, or trimmed, as well. I am no musicologist but if there are cuts in the recits they are minimal. In an era when completeness has becomes a fetish it is interesting that it has taken so long for an opera which has been memorialized many times.

Initially I had reservations about purchasing the set, mainly because Sven-Eric Bechtoff as the Stage Producer. Bechtoff is responsible for the worst (my opinion) Rosenkavalier, a production so absurd that it verges on the unwatchable. His Pelleas is equally ridiculous, set in some frozen tundra. I have kept the set for some very good singing, but little pleasure otherwise. His Don Giovanni is set in a hotel lobby (?)is equally goofy and only the presence of Simon Keenlyside was sufficient inducement to make the purchase. Bechtoff's next assault on the opera goers' sensibility was Nozze di Figaro. Both of these productions have been updated to present time without adding one bit of distinction, plus almost simultaneously two productions came out from the ROH that were so far superior that I suspect Zurich was put in the shade. Interestingly in both cases ROH had the same Figaro, Erwin Schrott and the same Don, Keenlyside and in both cases their presence is more vital in the English productions. But Cosi received a very positive review on line and the casting of the soprano, Malin Harteliu, enabled me to overcome my prejudices.

For the first time Bechtoff has kept the action in the 18th century, albeit in a very stylized manner. For those wanting a rococo mise-en-scene you will have to look elsewhere, probably the John E. Gardiner taping. Bechtoff is responsible for some very strange directorial decisions as regards stage business, presumably in the interest of creating humor. In some instances this can border on the tasteless but it should not be considered a ""deal breaker"" if you have an interest in acquiring this production. One directorial decision, however, must be brought up. As the principals are engaged in singing the finale, Fiordiligi notices the bottle of ""poison"" which our males lovers allegedly took only to be ""cured"" by Despina. Fiordiligi goes over to the bottle and puts some in her glass, drinks it, and promptly dies!!! What point is being made here is beyond me; it doesn't strike me as true to 18th century psychology nor does it make sense dramatically--in any context. Mozart initially referred to Cosi as a Dramma Giocoso, but subsequently defined it as an Opera Buffa. The notes accompanying the set make a number of references to the production but this point is never addressed.

Welser-Moest is the conductor; his band is not an early instruments group but they are capable of great precision and flexibility when dealing with some faster than usual tempi. Welser-Moest has developed into a very good opera conductor and his contributions to this Cosi are only one of the many  pleasures that this set provides.

As to the singers, only three were known to me: Oliver Widmer, A Zurich regular and the incomparable Hartelius and Martina Jankova--another Zurich regular. Ferrando is sung by Javier Camarena, a young Mexican tenor who bears more than a slight resemblance to his countryman,Ramon Varga. His Un aura amorosa is exquisitely sung and easily trumps an earlier Zurich Ferrando, Roberto Sacca. Camarena has a small voice even when compared with other Ferrandos. But his sensibilities are musical thus his performance is a satisfying one.

Ruben Drole is the Guglienim Anna Bonitatibus Dorabella, and Jankova the Despina. Drole and Bonitatibus generally hold up well in their roles if not effacing memories of Keenlyside and Christa Ludwig. Harlelius' performance is magisterial and glowing; vocally she is up to the rigors and difficulties presented in her two great arias. Only the absence of a truly articulated trill mars the performance. The vocal line includes considerable decorative flourishes, many of which feel incomplete with one. Of course it doesn't hurt that she is a great beauty and an  accomplised actress. I would dearly love to hear her in some Strauss--Rosenkavlier (the Marschallin of course since she has alread been seen in the above Rosenkavalier as Sophie) Capriccio and the ""E"" roles of Wagner, Eva and Else.

The choice of which Cosi to buy is complicated the the fact that there are many options available. Obviously the Sellers and the Barenboim sets are not in the running if what you want is a conventional production even so the Barenboim performance is very well sung. The most recent Glyndebourne set is highly competitive but then so is the Gardiner. Muti's Vienna taping (preferable to the Salzburg performance) shouldn't be overlooked even though it is not carried by Amazon. The earlier Glyndebourne set is distinguished only by Thomas Allen--a very young Allen. The remainder of the cast is more than adequate, but it never seems to take off, however, for those with a budget it shouldn't be overlooked. The Zurich set conducted by Harnencourt is essentially a showcase for Bartoli. Harnoncourt's tempi are idiosyncratic and can be irritating. Plus the fact that you have three mezzos in the cast the center of gravity is too low, casting somewhat of pall on the proceedings. Blade to the throat I suspect that I would choose the set under consideration even with the caveats noted above. Who said collecting DVD's was easy...........Rumor has it that lurking in the archives of ORF there is a taping with Schwarzkopf and Ludwig. If so it should be released ASAP.",1277078400,12,5720,4.994753410283316
2481234,4,B000E1P3DY,"I doubt this would be anyone's choice Cosi but the staging works
very well even if it is in many ways indebted to Sellars classic
Despina's cafe.  Now the opera is set in a sort of Club med
(the note's say 1960s youth hostel) so I sort of expected disaster.
None of the singers is vocally impeccable but they aren't bad either.
De Niesse's Despina is terrific. Though not immune to the complaints
of lack of support on top, Despina doesn't demand as much vocally but
she is perfect as a sort of camp companion.  What is best is the
score is given complete which isn't the case in most DVD productions.
I can't understand how Muti who insists on including every inkblot
in verdi, cuts Mozart.  It shows how Mozart and Da Ponte knew exactly
what they were doing.  Shankle might be a real find-- he sings all

8104153,5,B000E1P3DY,"I have become a real fan of the Drottningholm Court Theatre productions of this vintage, and can find nothing I'd want to change. This time, I was just a little thrown by the present-day scenes -- the singers in their everyday lives, and so on --shown during the Overture and at the very end; about these, I have mixed feelings: they jolt the Eighteenth-Century mood, but at the same time they underscore the opera's theme. (The only problem I still have with the opera's title is that I understand it is in the feminine -- in English, it works better: ""So Does Everyone"" of both sexes. For surely the male characters show up to no better advantage than do the female ones; and, indeed, on this watching what struck me most was how very long Fiordiligi held out against the combined attacks of everyone else.) While I cannot count ""Cosi"" among my personal favorite operas, it is one of the earliest I saw; I always enjoy its wonderful music; I can wholeheartedly recommend this particular production, and look forward to watching it again at home.",1389657600,2,1047,4.664864864864865

Only the reviews by Donald Kass and Lynn Vale seem to be for the current listing of Cosi with Metzmacher conducting the Netherlands Chamber Orch. Their reviews induced me to take a chance on this and they were right. This is a mostly successful updating of Cosi with a decent fit with the libretto and sense of action. The singing is good, the acting is even better. What makes the performance successful is that the voices blend rather well on the duets or quartets. This is not an Italianate singing group so don't expect that kind of idiomatic singing. The conducting is a bit lackluster and ordinary though. In short a fun updating of Cosi to a kind of vaguely 70s or 80s setting with a sympathetic cast.",1368662400,2,783,4.52112676056338
8104155,5,B000E1P3DY,"... in the prettiest production possible, staged in the meticulously restored Court Theater of Drottningholm -- The Queen's Palace -- west of Stockholm. The prettily painted sets and stage machinery are all precisely what audiences of the rococo late 1700's would have seen. The costumes suggest to me -- I'm no musicological haberdasher -- a slightly later era, but they're lovely to behold and well-sewn for vivacious acting. The too-seducible sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella are sung and acted by two pretty young Swedish maidens, Ann Christine Biel and Maria Hglind; their lithe figures in their matching white gowns are pretty enough for an impressionist painting. Ulla Severin is perfectly cast as the saucy maid Despina. The two lovers/seducers Ferrando and Guglielmo are acted and sung by two dashing Swedes, Lars Tibell and Magnus Linden. Only the portly old cynic Alfonso, sung by Enzo Florimo, is anything but pretty to look at, and even he could be regarded as ""cute"" by some.

I dwell on the visual attractions of this production because they are its most unique attribute. This is an historically authentic a mis-en-scene as any could hope for, short of garbing the whole audience in aristocratic finery of Mozart's era. The splendor is somewhat muted by the grainy soft-focus TV filming done in 1984, but the camera-work is excellent -- all the right close-ups in all the right places -- and the sound recording is good enough.

The singing is also ""good enough"" -- and better than ""good enough"" in the most important arias -- though all four of the principals could have profited by more current 2012-level historically informed vocal technique. Their voices are lovely but their sense of embellishment is somewhat plain.

""Cos Fan Tutte"" -- ""They're All the Same"" -- is of course also Mozart's most wickedly misogynistic opera. Remember, please, that our charming rascal Wolfi merely put music to the witty libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, that shameless misogynist. One might even suppose that da Ponte portrayed himself in the character of Alfonso, whose plotting determines the course of the drama.",1354233600,2,2116,5.109826589595376

There is some reoccurrence of singers between the operas:

ROBERTO ACCURSO is Antonio in Figaro and Masetto in Goivanni.
MAITE BEAUMONT is Cherubino in Figaro and Dorabella in Cosi.
MARIO LUPERI is Bartolo in Figaro and Commendatore in Giovanni.
GARRY MAGEE is Count Almaviva in Figaro and Don Alfonso in Cosi.
CHARLOTTE MARGIONE is Marcelina in Figaro an Donna Elvira in Giovanni.
DANIELLE DE NIESE is Susanna in Figaro and Despina in Giovanni.
LUCA PISARONI is Figaro in Figaro and Guglielmo in Cosi.
MERCEL REIJANS is Don Basilio in Figaro and Don Ottavio in Giovanni.
NORMAN SHANKLE is Don Curzio in Figaro and Fernando in Cosi.

The remaining singers are:

CORA BURGGRAAF is Zerlina in Giovanni.
CELIA COSTEA is Countess Almaviva in Figaro.
JOSE FARDDIHA is Leporello in Giovanni.
SALLY MATTHEWS is Fiordiligi in Cosi.
MYTRO PAPATANASIU is Donna Anna in Giovanni.
FLOOR VAN DER SLUIS is Babarina in Figaro.
PIETRO SPAGNOLI is Don Giovanni in Giovanni.
MELANIE GREVE and FANG FANG KONG are the First and Second Ladies in Figaro.

The singers are generally very good, well worth listening to. They are good actors as well. There is the added bonus that they physically match the roles they play, except Maite Beaumont in the trouser role of Cherubino. Her singing and acting are fine, but it is impossible to make her look like a man.

Some serious problems arose with the nontraditional staging. Cosi worked the best, Figaro broke down at the end, and Giovanni was a disaster throughout.

Cosi Fan Tutte was supposed to be set in a youth hostel. The revolving stage took us from room to room as the plot unfolded. It worked, mostly. There were the usual difficulties of staging a story outside its intended scenery. For example, the principles attended a dance party, while completely inappropriate music was playing.

Le Nozze Di Figaro was staged in a car dealership, which remained as the only staging. This worked to some degree, but the entrances and exits of the singers sometimes seemed bizarre without the appropriate changes in scenery. The garden scene near the end was shown on a black and white closed circuit television screen. It was fuzzy and confusing. Viewers who were unfamiliar with the story would have been bewildered. The television was a bad idea which should have been abandoned.

Don Giovanni was a travesty. The staging consisted of beds which the singers climbed in and out of. At the end of the opera, the beds moved around the stage. Often, singers who were not part of a scene remained on stage. Don Ottavio often caressed a doll, which was a replica of Donna Anna. Anyone who did not know the story would have missed much of the plot line. This production reminded me of something schoolboys might devise who wanted to mock an opera. All this was too bad, because the singers came to perform. Pietro Spagnoli was the most villainous Don Giovanni I've seen.

I can recommend Cosi, and Figaro with serious reservations, but not Giovanni. But there are so many worthy productions of Figaro and Giovanni, why bother, unless it's for the performers? Or if you happen to enjoy opera being trashed.",1351641600,,4076,5.702970297029703
8104157,5,B000E1P3DY,"This production of this 2009 performance of Cosi fan Tutte from Zurich is set in period as regards costuming but with very crisp, clear cut designs and sharply defined colours for the unfussy backdrops to the action. This gives it a very modern feel as well. In my opinion this very successfully enables the opera to be set in its own period while at the same time enabling it to speak directly to a modern age.

This crisp feel to the production permeates everything. Welser-Most conducts with incisive precision and the orchestra and singers respond to every tiny detail with remarkable accuracy. It is rare to hear so much inner detail without recourse to highlighted microphones. This does not simply apply to instrumental or vocal lines but also applies to significant accenting within those lines. This is a meticulous performance and, as such, is typical of this conductor's normal style. It certainly makes for exhilarating music making here and all of the musicians are up to the considerable challenges involved. My ears tell me that natural brass instruments of Mozart's time are used in conjunction with modern strings and woodwind in this performance. This is becoming a frequent means of producing real brass bite at volume without overwhelming the rest of the orchestra. It works very well adding both drama and excitement as in this performance.

The singers are described on the disc sleeve as `A Mozart ensemble that currently is probably without equal in the opera world' (Badische Zeitung) and that seems to me to be a perfectly fair summary. Malin Hartelius as Fiordiligi has a beautiful voice with just a slight touch of creaminess to the texture. She shows complete ease with the more florid demands of her part and delivers fully on the emotional depths as her fidelity is tested to the limit. Her sister, Anna Bonitatibus, is musically her equal and the two of them make a believable and vibrant pair in their roles. The roles of Despina/notary, sung by Martina Jankova - another outstanding singer/actress, are despatched with complete flair and evident enjoyment.

A strange and unexplained production decision occurs at the very end of this opera where all the main characters drink a toast to each other, but Fiordiligi's drink mistakenly contains the poison brandished earlier and then so carelessly not removed so she promptly dies. Why was this twist added to the opera?

The two fianc&eacute;s/suitors, Javier Camarina and Ruben Drole, have excellent voices and fall into their double roles with enthusiasm. Oliver Widmer as Don Alfonso is more seriously impressive as appropriate to his role which clearly shows him to be another fine singer/actor. The individual quality of these 5 singers is readily apparent throughout this opera but it is in the ensemble moments that the accuracy of the opening press quote at the beginning of the previous paragraph really strikes home. The finale to either act is an astonishing vocal tour de force as Welser-Most accelerates towards the conclusions.

The imaging is crisp with fully involving camera work bringing a great sense of `being there' to the screen. The sound is excellent and is presented in DTS-HD 7.1 as well as stereo.

I have enjoyed this disc very much indeed and would rank it right at the top with the equally excellent Glyndebourne alternative. Choice between the two seems likely to be largely a matter of taste and this may ultimately revolve around the contentious demise or survival of Fiordiligi. Other than that I would expect this disc to give much pleasure and musical satisfaction to most purchasers and for that reason see no other reason to give it less than the full 5 star rating.

I would suggest that this disc is worthy of serious consideration along with the very fine Glyndebourne production which has the, perhaps crucial advantage for some, of having exactly the expected ending without Fiordiligi's apparent death. The Glyndebourne would be my own personal favourite and probably the best choice as an 'only' purchase, but I still get plenty of pleasure from this disc too which makes for a good second version.",1341532800,4,4126,5.005830903790088
8104158,2,B000E1P3DY,"I rented this from my library with high hopes. The only other version I'd seen was the Teatro alla Scala conducted by Muti - which was OK in sound and acting but suffered more in the technical department. In the same way I'd seen that production, I wanted something that showed promise but was ""different,"" not featuring all the same famous singers whose names we see crop up time and again in modern opera.

First of all, the singers are something of a mixed bag. A rather young and pretty Fiordiligi is played by talented Adriana Damato. Her singing was exemplar in the arias where she obviously had greater free rein. However - I suspect by the conductor's doing - specific arias (""Per pieta,"" ""Come scoglio"") were ultimately ruined by rushing through aria finales and, less frequently, clumsy acting.

Ruben Martinez's slightly chubby Ferrando was exceptionally poor. Perhaps not the worst Ferrando out there, but the quality of his singing throughout was erratic. Unfortunately, his voice is easily heard above the others. Acting-wise, I believe he gawked more at the audience, floor, and empty space than at either Fiordiligi and Dorabella. He seemed unable to react to much of anything beyond what he conveyed with his sheep eyes.

Dorabella, played by Gloria Scalchi, was far different than what I expected. This Dorabella is older, heavier (was the fabric going to tear on her gown?) and far less flirtatious than Fiordiligi. Her ""acting"" is best summed up by her grasping the air, which was anything but poetic. Her voice, while good, was almost overwhelmed by timing (I laughed when she fought to catch up in ""Alla bella Despinetta"" and subsequently failed to). And her relationship with Guglielmo? He might have been some random gigolo who was pestering her.

Riccardo Novaro's Guglielmo was the highlight (along with, in part, Damato). His voice was rich and deep, probably not as deep as what I'm used to for Guglielmo, but certainly not bad. His performance was easy, amusing, and without much, if any, musical gliches. The acting was more than decent - Novaro was probably happiest with his role out of everyone, IMO - and overall, a presence that felt like it belonged. As in the case of Damato, his chemistry with Dorabella was noticeably one-sided and awkward.

Daniela Mazzuccato's Despina, on the other hand, did not live up to her role as well. Her major weak point is something very interesting - it's as if, as a singer, Mazzuccato's forte was singing solo in more private venues, not opera. Her stage presence with the others was incongruous: she sang, gestured, and frowned with little acknowledgement of the others, without anything of the flirtatious, teasing, sharp attitude we've come to expect in Despina's character. The technicalities of her singing, while not bad, did not make me want to listen to her arias again.

Don Alfonso was sung by Rolando Panerai. He started out a very promising Alfonso, but very quickly he turned to disappoint. Call it what you will, his voice is positively flat, dead, no life whatsoever. It also is quite loud enough to grate the ears in the ensemble scenes. His acting lacks so much for such a complex character: I don't know whether it's his age or because it's what was directed.

Finally, the translation was terrible because it deviated dramatically to suit specific aspects of this particular production. For example, in ""Prendero quel brunettino,"" Fiordiligi's line ""Ed intanto io col biondino vo'un po'ridere e burlar"" (""While I, with the blonde one, to laugh and tease..."" was instead translated to ""Then I'll enjoy myself with the other one."" (I suspect that had something to do with Martinez' dark hair.) Very frustrating to anyone who has listened and read Mozart.

All in all, a disappointing production that even specific highlights couldn't save. The so-called great Enrico Castiglione (bad direction) and Rome Philharmonic (squeaky, somewhat discordant instrumentation) should have been ashamed. Save your money and rent this from your library. You won't have to hassle to get your money back.",1312329600,,4075,5.008862629246677

This is the only performance I have ever heard which includes these additional 13 bars.
