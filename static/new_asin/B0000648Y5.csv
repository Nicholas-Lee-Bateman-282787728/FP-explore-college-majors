1706978,5,B0000648Y5,My daughter absolutly LOVES this video. The songs are catchy and the animals are super cute. It is a def. throw back to the early 90's with the kids but she doesn't care. It keeps her entertained and the songs are not annoying.,1322438400,,227,4.3023255813953485
1706979,5,B0000648Y5,I would recommend this product - my 2 year old grandaughter loves it and sits and watches it all the time.,1281312000,,106,4.095238095238095
1706980,3,B0000648Y5,The songs and the kids in this video are very annoying.  I don't want to watch it or hear it.  The kids over act like they are trying out for a broadway show.  Not of fan of child stars and the entertainment biz.  Our 2 1/2 year old really loves most of the dvd but agrees with us that dressing up monkeys is creepy and just not right.  Oh... please lose those little furry biggles (?) as they add to the annoying factor by 10x.,1278979200,,428,3.988235294117647
1706981,5,B0000648Y5,"I originally found this episode of Kidsongs (which my 2 year old daughter has dubbed ""petting zoo"") on YouTube. I bought it because the YouTube version was removed (and before that was ad supported), plus I wanted better quality picture. My daughter normally hates TV. Before this video the best we had was 5-10 minutes of Sesame Street to get ready in the morning. Now, she'll sit there for the full 20 minutes and watch. And best, it isn't passive watching. She identifies the animals and sings along, especially to Jeepers Creepers. I'd highly recommend this CD to anyone. The songs are fun and not overly annoying for adults. I even find myself singing them sometimes during the day.",1274745600,,687,4.781512605042017
1706982,4,B0000648Y5,"my daughter loves this dvd... she has another Kids songs and while the kids in it to my older children ""look so fake"" my 3 yr old loves it and sings and dances to it and after all she is who it was bought for so her reaction is what counts... I will probably order her at least one of the others... don't think I would get all available though I like to give her variety",1124323200,2,370,3.8815789473684212
1706983,5,B0000648Y5,"This is one of our favorite Kidsongs DVD's.  The baby animals are completely irresistable, and the kids are too.  The video is very good quality and it's just overall FUN!  My 15 month old has been mesmerized by it for months now.  She loves all seven Kidsongs DVD's we own.  They are pure, innocent, quality programming for young people.  There is so much over-done, computer generated entertainment out there these days, it's refreshing to see REAL children with real animals, singing and dancing and being creative!  I highly recommend this DVD.",1070064000,2,548,4.956043956043956
1706984,3,B0000648Y5,"I found this at our public library and borrowed it because it looked cute.  I didn't have exceedingly high expectations because many kids' videos have tendancies towards sub-par production quality.  Kidsongs - I Can Sing Baby Animal Songs didn't disappoint my little lady.
I'd recommend you borrow before you buy (if you can), but either way you're probably going to get exactly what you expect from a Kidsongs DVD.  It's cute, it's silly, it's bright and colorful both visually and in song.  It's not knock-your-socks-off great, but the little lady hardly blinks when it's on, and that's the tot's true enjoyment litmus test.",1066003200,4,626,5.048543689320389
