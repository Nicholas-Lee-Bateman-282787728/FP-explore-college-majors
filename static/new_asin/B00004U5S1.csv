3414949,3,B00004U5S1,"Sadly, like many of the other reviewers, I too have to leave a meager 3 stars for this film. I just wanted to keep shouting ""can your acting get any worse"" at Madonna and seeing Rupert Everett with buffed out arms and those cut off sleeves just ruined all of his ""James Bond"" style roles. Though the best part of this film was the touching relationship between father and son, it was nice to see the love between the two and how far this father was willing to go to remain in his sons life.",1421280000,,490,4.168421052631579

3414956,4,B00004U5S1,"I have a lot of gay friends and the way they love me make me think how lovely could be having a baby with them, of course skipping the sex part because it would be unavoidable feel the awkwardness no matter if we were drunk or not.
I've always said that having a gay friend is like having a 2 x 1 because they can act like a girlfriend and they still have that male part inside of them so they can see the whole picture and open your eyes if necessary.
I think I wanna live Abby's life, have a Robert being the real father of my baby because is the best father ever!!!
I really love this movie",1330732800,,593,3.95

I am a Madonna fan yes but this was her first role i ever watched where she was really acting and not playing herself. There a few transitions in the film that could be fixed but nothing that was to bad. Its lighthearted while still being serious you laugh when the characters laugh you cry when they do its a great story. Watch this movie I did twice today when i first got it.",1264464000,,444,4.36144578313253
3414959,1,B00004U5S1,"i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one.",1262131200,,237,3.857142857142857
3414960,1,B00004U5S1,Just god awful!!!! Madonna cannot act worth anything!!!! She can barely make decent albums now much less act. You know Rubert only did this as a favor!!! Please!!!!!! Just sad!!!! Not even worth buying if it were 99 cents.,1252195200,,222,4.717948717948718
3414961,2,B00004U5S1,"I've watched this movie twice, and I am not sure I will watch it again.
First of all, I'm one who had never had anything bad to say about Madonna's acting, but here she's really bad. She gets better and the movie progresses, it's almost distracting, because she's supposed to be the center of the attention.
Rupert Everett is fine, he looks dashing of course, like Benjamin Bratt.
But then, the movie itself is really badly done. They had the locations, the sets, and yet it's just not at all good and almost boring at times, not to mention the familiar places we've been at before and the really annoying court scenes. Just how many times do we have to see attorneys trashing innocent people?
Honestly, there is nothing new in this movie to make it worth watching more than once to convince yourself how not good it is.",1211673600,,820,4.510067114093959
3414962,5,B00004U5S1,"Finally, a film that is much less cynical than most love stories I've seen. Forgiveness is a rare lesson taught in Hollywood, much less TOLERANCE. The Director/Writer both illustrated an idea-- Love is what people need, not conventionality or normalcy. The parts of Rupert's grandparents show a contrast in accepting their son's lifestyle. My favorite character was the grandmother, but Madonna did her best work as well. 5 Stars for The Next Best Thing!",1204934400,,454,5.148648648648648
3414963,1,B00004U5S1,"OMG. This movie is a -5
Madonnas ridiculous half British accent is beyond annoying.
If the people working with her had any kind of balls they would of told her she sounds like an idiot.
The director should of forced her to clean this up.

 Brit's everywhere cringe at it and as a yank who knows accents and has many British friends I was disgusted at the pompous mixed up cadence in her affected wannabe fake accent.
Now that I got that out of my system, the acting in this movie is so bad, they should show it at acting schools on what not to do.
So wooden, her timing is awful. My gosh her voice is so flat and monotone.
She did seem to suddenly lose her accent in the scenes with just her and the kid and was not bad.
She made sure she looked good in every scene, and like someone else said the lighting man must of been paid extra to give her soft golden light no matter what the scene was.
Also rather gagging was the way everyone keeps telling her how beautiful and wonderful she is???
What was that all about?
It rang hollow and contrived to say the least.
Rupert did the best with what he had, the little boy was pretty good and Benjamin Bratt was the most believable thing in the whole movie.
(except when he told her he loved her!)
Then when she just moves out and takes the boy, it gets ugly.(ier)
It is very cliched and gay bashing, like sterotype statements about being gay and from people who oppress the gays.
It seems very 1980-early 90's, move on already.
 Lawyers and judges in NY would of never said that stuff. Then when Rupert makes his speech saying
""It seems all I do is worry about blood, my whole life is about blood"" What is that?
Many people have already told the twist in here, but they really messed up by making the kid not really his.
What a mess this movie is. It never seemed to decide what it was trying to say or be. Comedy? Drama? New family roles? Sell out at the end?
It did keep my attention for a few hours on TV, where it seemed like it should of been in the first place, (total lifetime movie and a bad one)
The ending is so abrupt I think the producers knew it was unfixable.
Watching the actors muddle through this mess was entertaining in it's own sick way! Now I feel like watching a real movie to get rid of the taste of this one.",1198195200,,2277,4.158730158730159
3414964,3,B00004U5S1,"This film has suffered very, very bad publicity and very, very bad reviews. But if you choose to see it open-minded, you might just get to like this mess.

""The Next Best Thing"" initially sets itself up as a comedy. Robert (played by Rupert Everett) is always there for his best friend Abbie (Madonna), especially when it comes to comfort her over her terrible taste in men. And since he's also keen on men, he gives her a few pointers along the way. However, after a few drinks (and an unbelievably entertaining Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers act), Abbie gets pregnant. The viewer is then quite surprised when the whole thing turns serious and chaotic as Robert and Abbie decide to live and raise the baby together, and then struggle with problems concerning their family, friends and Abbie's new sweetheart (Benjamin Brett).

Now, the good thing about this film are its stars. Although it's hard to believe that it's taken them 30 minutes of the film to sleep together and that Madonna can't find a man in L.A., they are irresistible. Everett is top-notch as always and Madge has rarely seemed as much at home with a part as she does in this film. They are able to pull off the comedic parts and are good enough when the film surprisingly evolves into a study of family life.

However, the second half of the film doesn't really work. The problem is that ""The Next Best Thing"" is made of too many different influences and styles connected with very loose bonds. Are you able to go through a sitcom, a melodrama, and a courtroom drama in one film? Yes , it's quite possible to watch the ups and downs of this glamorous couple, but it can be difficult to digest the way they are developed.",1171324800,,1685,4.572847682119205
3414965,3,B00004U5S1,"With all the star power behind this movie, it should have been executed skillfully; pulling the viewer into the lives of nice people, exploring the novel living arrangements and lifestyles of the main characters, even highlighting what should have been a key, dramatic moment in the movie. Instead, the movie drags on for nearly an hour before we have an inkling of what this movie is really about.  As it drags itself forcefully along we have great difficulty identifying with the characters or their plight.

Abbie Reynolds (Madonna) is a woman who hears her biological clock ticking. She wants to meet a nice guy and have one or more children. Failing meeting Mr. Right, she would at least like to have a child. After breaking up with yet another boyfriend, Madonna commiserates with a homosexual friend, Robert Whittaker (Ruppert Everett), and the two end up (good heavens!) doing something sexual together. Soon after, Madonna reveals she is pregnant. Robert decides he wants to be fully involved as Sam's (Malcolm Stumpf) father.

Well, time flies and Ben Cooper, excellently played by Benjamin Bratt, enters the picture, quickly falling in love with Abbie. Ben behaves just as we would like or hope he would, and adjusts his life to suit Abbie, Robert and Sam's as much, if not more, than is reasonable. Unfortunately for poor Sam, the relatively immature conflict between Abbie and Sam washes aside all Ben's good deeds and flexibility and a nasty court battle ensues. I'll not give away the ending or any other details in the event you wish to try the movie yourself.

In addition to the star horsepower already mentioned, Lynn Redgrave, Neil Patrick Harris, and Joseph Sommer, all with extensive acting credentials, appear. The director and producer add even more horsepower. The problem is that all this horsepower failed to help me understand the plot, or empathize with the characters. This movie presented a wonderful opportunity to help explore having a homosexual as a parent, and deal more in depth with the issues of homosexuality and stereotypes surrounding homosexuality. Instead, the movie usually pays only brief lip service to those issues.  In some cases the movie opens the door to the issue, and then sweeps it under the rug. In one example, Sam asks Robert about a inappropriate word he heard associated with homosexuals, and what the word meant. Instead of dealing with the issue, the answer was more akin to ""babies come from the cabbage patch."" If the movie did not want to deal with sensitive issues, it should not have brought them up in the first place.

After forcing myself to watch this movie for an hour or more in the hope that it would really take off and make a statement, it devolved into legal bickering between Abbie and Robert with all sorts of uninteresting confusion thrown in by Ben and an old boyfriend of Abbie's. Instead of a grand statement regarding homosexuals as parents, the movie became just another couple bickering over child custody and I became extremely disappointed with the plot development.

Even in the final moments of the movie, the opportunity to do more than have a trite and cliche ending was passed by. There is little more I can say about the ending.

The movie is not a total loss. Benjamin Bratt and Malcolm Stumpf have good chemistry during their interactions with others in the movie. Had Benjamin and Malcolm been absent, this movie would have been a total loss. As it is, I rate this movie three stars largely on the performance of these two actors and what they brought to the movie.",1156896000,,3562,4.866336633663367
3414966,2,B00004U5S1,"She keeps on trying doesn't she, our Mads, like the trooper she is. No matter how many times the critics trash her. Honestly, this movie had a lot of potential, with an interesting story line that tackled a kind of a modern day re-definition of family units and the moral dilemmas and choices involved. With its very worthy supporting cast it could have really gone somewhere but just failed to get there.

  Madonna god bless you, I truly wish you could read this because I have two bits of stern advice which I'm sure many others would agree with, to help your (flailing) acting career, if it's not too late. Firstly, get some major voice coaching! Your delivery of dialogue is so unbelievably stilted and wooden at times. It's like you've just learnt the script. And what is up with this phoney pseudo half British half American accent you put on? Was that supposed to be part of your character development or research?. Even though her gay best friend 'Robert' is British, the audience would assume 'Abbie' is just an American living in LA. Besides which, it just  sounded so fake. I mean we know you've become a bit of an 'Anglo-Phile' now that you're married to a pom (Australian slang for 'English person'), but you don't have to make it part of every character you play now do you? Concentrate on your acting craft before you start with the specialty accents luv. Meryl streep you aint. Secondly, if you want us to believe in Madonna the actress you've got to leave out Madonna the pop star just for a moment, and quit with the mindless marketing of your pop image, just for the sake of selling more records. My god woman, why does nearly everyone of your movies have to feature your music in the soundtrack somewhere? That scene early on in the film, where you all sing American Pie, at the gay friend's lover's funeral, was just sooo embarrassingly contrived and unnecessary. And quite frankly, fond as I am mostly of your music, your recorded version of 'American Pie' was very weak. Just lifeless.

  I know I am being a bit harsh but someone really needs to tell you these things, or rather you really need to hear them,'cause I have actually been a fan of yours from the beginning. Despite your money hungry commercialism, you're an amazing artist and woman in so many ways. I see the potential in your performances often and you have an incredible presence on stage and screen that cannot be denied. But when it comes to the craft of acting a lot more subtlety and discipline is required and you need to learn a bit of humility darling, come down to earth.

  Now, as for the redeeming features of this movie, and there are some. I would love Rupert Everett in anything he does. He's so cleverly sardonic and witty in that classy British way. Unfortunately though he is sold rather short here due to a poor script and mediocre direction, but I still enjoyed his performance. I must say I did feel awfully sorry for Robert near the end. He must have felt, intentionally or not, tricked and used by Abbie in a way. I mean she really should have taken responsibilty to ensure who the father was initially, don't you think?. Benjamin Bratt is most easy on the eye and a welcome hetero-sexual addition. Also, I loved the colourful 'Sante Fe' style design and setting. As well as Madonna 'hippyish yoga teacher' chic, (though the yoga thing is also somewhat contrived, no doubt Madonna's influence?) Lastly, there are moments (yes some) when Madonna's acting and character are believable. I always find her the most convincing in her character's more casual, fun moments. Which makes me think she is better suited to lighter comedic roles like earlier on in her career. The kid who plays Sam is quite natural and cute. In reality though that poor child would be left feeling so torn and confused after all that had occurred. He's faced with the prospect of three fathers (or at least father roles) in his life. Overall I quite enjoyed the first part, but really lost interest when the 'same old, same old' court room battle scene came around. This movie isn't a total waste of time and it's always interesting to see what 'Queen Madonna' will come up with next.",1135900800,,4170,4.622972972972973
3414967,5,B00004U5S1,"Have you ever bought at the stock market when everybody told you to sell - and won? That's what happened to me with this film. After buying almost all of John Schlesinger's films, I hesistated before ordering this one - in view of all that criticism. But then I assumed that - 1) Schlesinger cannot suddenly make a bad film after making so many excellent ones, and - 2) if so many bad  things are said about a film it must somehow be good. Luckily, I was right this time.

Perhaps much of all that criticism springs from unjustified expectations. Let me try to put two points right: First: this is not a film about Madonna, or by Madonna. She is just an actress here - and a good one, just right for the part. Schlesinger does not present her as a singer or a sex symbol - but as a person. Secondly: Nobody has made a promise that this will be an in-depth, politically correct exploration of gay life. This is just a film - and an entertaining one. There is no law in the land that says a gay person cannot be at times a trifle ridiculous  or sentimental, like other persons.

Therefore I recommend you follow the advice Madonna gives in her part as a Yoga teacher: Take a deep breath and relax - just enjoy this as another very good Schlesinger film - a real work of art.",1133913600,,1272,4.243801652892562
3414968,2,B00004U5S1,"This movie treats gays like preteens keen on, but too afraid to have sex with women. It reeks with anti-gay stereotypes without even being funny. It could be described as Madonna's ego trip delusion that all gay men are hot for her.",1116633600,,232,4.5476190476190474
3414969,2,B00004U5S1,"I saw this film after hearing enough of bad reputation of the film. Madonna does well in musicals because she can sing and dance, but acting is not something she is good at.

The story itself was not too bad. It was just that good acting was missing in the movie. I don't know why a smart hard working person like Madonna did so poorly in the film. With the interesting story they could have done better. It's too bad that it turned out like that.",1113609600,,447,4.1976744186046515
3414970,2,B00004U5S1,"First, I'd like to say that I am a huge madonna fan. I own all of her CDs, many singles and many movies -- well, except this one.

Synopsis: In 'The Next Best Thing', Madonna and Rupert Everett play two best friends who have a drunken one night stand, resulting nine months later in the birth of their son. The problem? The father is gay. For six years everything is peachy until Madonna's character, Abbie, meets and becomes engaged to Ben Cooper, played by Bejamin Bratt. Now instead of creating a new-aged 'two daddies and a mommy' kind of family, they go into a full-out custody battle over their son, Sam.

The Problems: Despite great acting from great actors, the storyline goes from happy and feel-good to disappointing and quite frankly, depressing. Also, being gay myself, I was confused as to why Rupert and Madonna would have sex. This movie brings up the very sensitive subject of gay panenting. Instead of making a profound statement about modern families and gay parents, it avoids the issue altogether and leaves viewer asking ""Isn't blood thicker than water?"" 'The Next Best Thing' could have been a great movie and even a big step forward in the gay community, but fails without any effort.

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the AMAZING sountrack. Madonna, as always, contibutes fabulous songs. In this case it's her great cover of ""American Pie"" and the tearjerking ballad ""Time Stood Still"". Every song on this soundtrack is comepletely beautiful. My personal favorites are 'Swayambhu' by Solar Twins, 'Boom Boom Ba' by Metisse and 'Bongo Bong' by Manu Chao. So my advice to you: go buy 'Swept Away', 'Evita', and 'The Next Best Thing' soundtrack -- but avoid this movie.",1109635200,,1701,4.818493150684931
3414971,1,B00004U5S1,"This movie is a major disappointment mostly because it has a great idea (a gay man and straight woman raising a child) but the movie ultimately sabotages it and the result is indulgent, dull and smug.  Although Madonna and Rupert Everett have a nice chemistry, that's about the only good thing about the movie.  The script is terrible and the choices made seem less from the director than Madonna and Rupert themselves.  Madge insisted her character be changed from a school teacher to a yoga instructor.  It's silly and Madonna, like in many of her films except for Evita and Swept Away, never connects with the character.  The strange lighting (especially around Madonna's eyes) is distracting and seems to take on a new type of lighting in film:  ""The Light Madonna This Way Lighting Technique"".

A miserable experience.",1100217600,,823,4.920289855072464
3414972,4,B00004U5S1,"I watched this flick when it first came out in year 1999. I can't be bothered by the Academy winning director. And I couldn't bother the DVD until I realised the special features include a video of the soundtrack: AMERICAN PIE. Like our spotlight reviewer Ruma, I grab it since I really like most of the music videos by Madonna. AMERICAN PIE is as great as melancholy to look at.
Industrially speaking, this film was released in a ""smart"" timing (Thanks to Rupert Everett who claims to have brought the script to his friend Madonna). Cinema-goers were terribly missing that kind of gay-straight friendship chemistry after MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING. Benjamin Bratt was dating Julia Roberts. And Madonna, what can I say, as usual was desperately in need for the next best surprise at all her risk for her Hollywood status. So no matter how bad we know who can or cannot act sometimes, we still queued up in the movie liners then.
It also doesn't matter how this film did not example a good ending for the moral of gay-parenting. Sam (the biological son of Abbie and her ex lived-in Kelvin) is taken care of and loved and will always remember that the gay man Robert has been the father from the very beginning. So blood is thicker but doesn't count in this circumstance.",1088899200,,1267,4.635555555555555
3414973,2,B00004U5S1,"""Chosen Family"" is an important concept to gay and lesbian people. Abbie (Madonna), a straight yoga instructor, and Robert (Rupert Everett), a gay landscaper, are best friends and, more importantly, chosen family. They've been through a lot together, so when they have drunken sex one night and Abbie ends up pregnant, they decide to move in together and raise the child together in their own little unconventional family. Neither of them counts on Abbie meeting someone and falling in love. When it happens, things take a nasty turn that ends in the courtroom.
As much as I love Madonna, there's a reason why most of her movies flop. With the exception of Evita, she seems to have very bad taste in movie scripts. This one is slightly better than some of her other choices, but it's really not all that special and it can't seem to decide what it wants to be, romantic comedy or serious family drama. Madonna and Rupert never seem to really inhabit their characters. Over all, it's rather depressing. This movie definitely falls far short of what could have been a powerful statement about modern families and gay parents. Not recommended.",1082678400,,1140,4.851282051282051
3414974,5,B00004U5S1,"Some people thought this movie sucked. Man, are they wrong. This movie was excellent. I really enjoyed it. I wasn't too thrilled with Rupert Everett's performance, but Madonna's performance was spectacular, as usual.
  Madonna plays Abbie Reynolds, a yoga instructer, whose boyfriend has just left her. She goes to her best friend, Robert (played by Rupert Everett) for a way to get over this. One night, the two become lovers. Abbie then finds out that she's pregnant, and Robert is the father. But Robert is also... gay. Seven years later, while getting ready to do a yoga class, Abbie meets Ben, a charming guy who is very interested in Abbie. The two begin dating. Ben decides that he wants to marry Abbie and it makes Robert furious because he does not want anyone taking his place as Sam's father.
  If any one of you took the advice from the one's who said that this movie sucked, give that advice back. This movie did not suck. It has a real good storyline and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy.",1073952000,,1006,4.603351955307263

However, her acting has been touch and go.  Additionally, I never really thought about the male perspective when divorcing females, and hearing how angry they would get about their bi*ch ex-wives.  After seeing the scene in the courtroom, I had a new understanding.  The only thing unbelievable was Madonna driving away in a Lexus ES300--ya right!

By far the best thing-- about the only good thing in the movie is the younster who plays Everett and Madonna's child. He's quite wonderful but alone cannot save this movie. For the most part, the lines are trite, the characters are wooden, the older gay men are hopeless stereotypes. Somebody should have told someone, the director, the producer, the actors, that this movie doesn't succeed on any level. Apparently no one was honest enough to say that.
Near the end of the movie, Madonna-- well, her name is Abbie, but I'm convinced she is playing herself-- meets up with Everett and says, ""We really messed up this time; didn't we?""
At last she finally got something right.",1059177600,,1212,4.641860465116279
3414978,4,B00004U5S1,"In this attempt to illustrate modern family configurations, 'The Next Best Thing' had a bit too much of an agenda for me. It brings up a lot of issues, most of which more for me make the 'main point' recede into the background.
Approaching this as a social concern issue, at different parts of the film I would have different responses. Certain by the end of the film, as the child had come to recognise Robert as 'dad', it would only do harm to the child to break this relationship. However, the question of whether there is a realistic prospect of even the best of friends living together in such a manner as Abbie and Robert, when both are likely (and in fact in the movie, did, albeit rather perfunctorially until the end) to want to continue to have intimate adult relationships before long, no matter how much they subordinate these desires in consideration of the child. It is a family arrangement almost certainly doomed to failure, particularly given Abbie's history of not being able to achieve a successful, sustained relationship.
With regard to the film as itself, Rupert Everett is the saving grace of the film. Madonna is not, I think, as bad as many people think, in this film. She does a good and credible job.  But her character lacked a multi-dimensionality that the script tried to hide by interjecting diversions (the yoga, the unconventional household arrangement, etc. -- these things are intended to give more 'character' to the Madonna's character, or, like a magician's assistant, divert your attention from the fact there's not much substance there). Everett's character is only somewhat more fleshed out, but only in one real direction.
The subplots are, alas, unsuccessful -- we don't get enough detail or enough emotion. Who is this person who died at the beginning? Beyond knowing his family didn't like him until he was dead, and knowing that high liturgical funerals are not to his liking, we don't know much. Yet this is, I believe, supposed to be a critical issue in the film--acceptance of varying styles of families, and the problems that arise from their lack of legal standing.
I applaud movies like this that try to combat the various forms of prejudice out there. As non-traditional families become more the norm than the exception, a greater understanding of the people in those relationships is very important. I just wish for better vehicles than this, that have more believable characters (and more fully-human characters) and more credible situations.
Overall, I enjoyed the film, and I am a sucker for a happy ending. But, is it happy? When will the relationship with Abbie's husband cease to work out? Will Robert as a single father ever form a successful relationship? Are they still doomed to failure? I doubt a sequel will be produced to answer these questions.",1058832000,,2812,4.882845188284519

1.  Madonna is absolutely devoid of ANY acting ability whatsoever.
2.  The dialogue is just bone dry.  Rupet Everett is a very talented actor, and you can tell that he is very clearly the ONLY member of the cast that has even just the ability to inject any life into these hollow shells of characters.
3.  The supporting cast was either phoning it in or has nothing to offer.
4.  The quasi-British accent Madonna seems to have developed was driving me nuts.  YOU'RE NOT FROM LONDON!!!  NOBODY'S BUYING IT!!!!!!!!!
5.  The movie was unforgivably long.
6.  The pace of the script was terrible.  It was almost as if the director had actually lost track of time, realized the movie was running long, tried to wrap everything up too quick.  The problem with that was the plot of the movie was in such a state of total disarray at that point in the film it was impossible to end comfortably.  If he tried to flesh it out, it would have been a three hour film.
This whole mess is something I expect to see my wife watching on `Lifetime,' and if it were in that role they may have been able to turn it into a mini-series and freed their hands a bit with their run time.  In that role, it may have been a modest success.  That said though, I certainly do not expect this level of dreck coming from a major motion-picture studio.

The unconventional family angle present here will raise the ire of many a United Future MP (which in my opinion is always a good thing), but really that's the only positive comment I can make about this drivel. THE NEXT BEST THING is by turns unconvincing, pompous and soapy. How could John ""Midnight Cowboy"" Schlesinger of all people, make a movie like this?
However, there are a few unintentional laughs scattered here and there. Early on Madonna screams at her ex, just before he leaves her: ""What you want is a bimbo! And that's exactly what you deserve!"". Dramatic irony? Speaking of dramatics, Madonna's acting is still awful (her accent is fluctuating between Brit and Yank), but she's still quite attractive here. Obviously the lighting tech on this film was really deserving of his paycheck. The movie gets 2 stars simply because it's still far superior to Madonna's most recent cinematic regurgitation, SWEPT AWAY. But just because I use the word ""superior"" it doesn't mean this is any good either. Anyhoo; each to their own, I say.

The movie itself is very good - not without flaws, but still enjoyable and immensely watchable. The courtroom scenes are particularly well done.
Now for the $50000 question - how does Madonna perform??? In my opinion exceptionally well. She has really matured as an actress during her 20+year career. She seems considerably more comfortable in front of the movie camera , and after the first few minutes of the film I forgot I was watching Madonna and I believed her characterization of Abbie.

3414983,1,B00004U5S1,"""The Next Best Thing"" attempts to accomplish three things: provide a realistic portrait of ""unconventional"" families that include a gay parent, promote tolerance for people regardless of sexual orientation, and, most daunting of all, show that its star, Madonna, can act after all. On all three counts, the movie fails.  And miserably it does.  Madonna is Abbie, a thirtysomething woman who, having been dumped by her boorish boyfriend, desperately tries to ""settle down"" with a husband and raise a family before it's ""too late.""  On one evening, she and her gay pal (Rupert Everett) get severely intoxicated and later discovers she's pregnant (don't ask).  They decide to move in together and raise the kid.  That's as much as I can say without revealing spoilers, but I'll go ahead and add that ""The Next Best Thing"" is an exercise in across-the-board ineptitude.  Madonna's performance just isn't convincing enough to earn our sympathy; she whines, pouts, and tries too hard to register with the audience.  The rest of the characters are badly stereotyped: we have the queens who spend all hours discussing legendary Hollywood actresses, the tough-as-nails Black judge, and the thuggish, fried chicken-eating homophobic rappers.  Worst of all is the script, which unnecessarily adds twist after twist in a desperate attempt to give the movie its much-needed dramatic thrust.  Like ""Mommie Dearest"" and other camp classics, ""The Next Best Thing"" is entertaining for all but the right reasons.  If you're looking for a movie to laugh AT but not laugh WITH, this flick is a perfect Saturday night rental.  Otherwise, prepare thyself to be bored and insulted.",1038355200,,1658,5.195488721804511

No heroes or heroines here -- everybody just double-crosses everybody. If they had tried to make it into a zany comdedy after the manner of A FISH CALLED WANDA or the more slapstick parts of MR. DEEDS, they might have had some success. But as is, THE NEXT BEST THING tries to be a serious movie without any real redeeming value.

I think that The Next Best Thing is a much better and more enjoyable movie to watch than the boring Evita for which so much cammotion was made over it and even won Madonna an award.
Being that this is a Madonna film The Next Best Thing is a very pleasant movie to watch with the whole family.  It is a movie that the whole family can sit together and enjoy watching.  The movie is clean and deals with a modern day issue that focuses on alternative family situations.  Both Rupert Everett and Madonna give good performances though Madonna's acting skills could be improved.  Madonna gives a reasonably well performance that eludes her rather [bad] acting skills. In some scenes Madonna looks like she is acting, her movements are stiff, but manages to get by with an average performance.  The real highlight of the film is the handsome Rupert Everett.  He gives a wonderful performance and one which makes you sympathize with his character in the film and love him.  Rupert Everett is the Best Thing in the Next Best Thing.

3414990,2,B00004U5S1,"I put off seeing this for a long time due to the extremely bad reviews, but got cornered into seeing it the other day.  I did find some admirable things about it, which I'll end the review to put it on a positive note.  But it also has a bunch of problems which makes one think that Hollywood's idea of the world earns them the title of ""La-La-Land"".
The story involves a pair of best friends, a gay male and hetero female,  who have a drunken liason one night that produces a child.  What I thought was going to be a comedy (as it was billed) about the adventures that this causes turns out to be a much more serious movie about other things, some good, some bad.
First, we have a gardener and a yoga instructor pooling incomes.  Sorry folks, these jobs don't pay a lot.  While not living extravagantly, they still seem to have a lifestyle that goes way beyond their realistic incomes.  This is just the first of many ways the movie is interested in portraying eye candy more than telling an even remotely realistic story.
Continuing on the eye-candy role was the complete avoidance of hard-times that come with evey new baby.  Since they chose to take a very serious tone in the movie, they could have shown Madonna dragging her butt out of bed at 3 a.m. to answer a cry, or hunky Everett cleaning up a big mess.  But we see this apparantly absolutely perfect baby's first years bypassed to produced an apparantly absolutely perfect child.  In this world, you can't be bad-looking or out of shape.
So while the movie falls apart with no connection to reality whatsoever, I did find some things that salvaged a bit of it.  When I still thought this was going to be a comedy, I was prepared to see a bunch of situations where certain cast members would not know the whole story, and there would be scenes to cover-up the situation.  It was refreshing to see that the whole story was explained to each character as they entered the picture.  The way all the characters acted here did give it a bit of intelligence, and it was refreshing to not see his parents freak out.  I also liked that the movie averted negative gay stereotypes, but when the movie ended, and I heard one of my kids crying, it was nice to get back to reality.",1019433600,,2229,4.404878048780488

Basically, you have Abbie (Madonna) and Robert (Everett), who would be the perfect couple except that Robert is gay, so they're just the best of friends.  One Independence Day, Abbie and Robert decide to get drunk (very drunk) to kind of shed their previous relationship and life problems.  While drunk, they have sex.  Later, Abbie learns that she is pregnant and tells Robert (who is still upset over actually having sex with a woman) that she's pregnant with his child.  Robert moves in with Abbie, and they're still living in the same house after almost six years.
That's when, after Robert encourages her to date, Abbie meets and falls in love with Ben (Benjamin Bratt).  This complicates everything and the satirical comedy takes a very dramatic edge, but in the end, everything will be alright.
I would definitely recommend this movie.  Though, it's not the 'feel good movie of the year', it will make a lot of girls long to have a gay best friend.",1018396800,,1151,4.691542288557214
3414992,1,B00004U5S1,"The Next Best Thing's advertising put great emphasis on the comedy aspects. While it does have some amusing scenes [none of them hilariously funny], the entire second half is melodrama on the order of a TV soap opera, only not nearly as clever.
Madonna plays Abbie, a hip Los Angeles woman of about forty who says she never married because she never found the right guy. When her live-in boyfriend walks out on her, she runs to her best friend, Robert [Rupert Everett], a handsome gay man who has decided that he may never have another serious relationship. He tells her she is better off without the guy, which is true, yet she pines, not so much for the old flame, as for the fact that she may never have a family of her own. Robert lives in the guest house of a swank Hollywood Hills home belonging to two old queens, who would have had the movies best lines if it had had any. Left alone at the house one 4th of July, Robert and Abbie drown their sorrows in margaritas and wind up in bed together. A few weeks later, Abbie announces she is pregnant with Robert's child. Robert decides that he will move in with her and be a real Dad to the child, although he thinks marriage would be hypocritical. After all, satisfying each other has certain limits. All this works out for six years, until Abbie meets Ben [Benjamin Bratt], and they fall in love.
This is a perfect plot for a satirical comedy about love, lust, puritanical inhibitions and other such nonsense. Instead, the movie does an about face and becomes serious. The characters get mad, angry and downright ugly. Then, as if the producers saw the damage they'd done, there is a trite 'feel good' ending, which looks tacked on.
Madonna and Everett do the best they can with the material. I can't really gauge Madonna's acting ability. She was superb in Evita and a few other movies, but I suspect that she hasn't the discipline to throw her full talents into anything she doesn't believe in one hundred percent. I know Everett is a fine actor, but here there is little he can do except reprise his character from My Best Friend's Wedding. In real life, the two stars are good friends, and I can only imagine all the knowing glances exchanged between them during production.
It is frankly a bit shocking that John Schlesinger directed the film. Thirty years ago he directed two movies, Midnight Cowboy and Sunday, Bloody Sunday, which expertly examined the nuances and subtleties of human sexuality. He's at a total loss here.

Either that or she does not try at all. Her characters all seem like caricatured extensions of her public persona. Perhaps she is affected by the fact that she is Madonna. You cannot lose sight of the fact that she is Madonna when you see her in films. Still, from anyone else, the viewing public would not accept this level of crap. The story is about a yoga teacher (Madonna) and her gay best friend.

Madonna's husband Guy recently said that she needed a director that would ""direct her."" I think that's a big factor in why her performance was bad in this film; she has too much creative control and forgets to ""act."" Madonna is VERY aware of the camera in this film and it's obvious. For instance, she never, ever looks bad. Even when she's ""sobbing her heart out"" she looks good, which is stupid. I think she should have gotten a red face, smeared her makeup and tried to sound as if she was heartbroken. Not looking all glistening and beautiful with slightly wet eyes.
However, it was obvious she's been taking lessons of some sort, because she actually has expressions when she delivers her lines, but, man she needs to forget the camera entirely. Take a good look at ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" and you'll see what I mean. The rumor was the director edited a lot of Madonna's parts out because she just wasn't that good. I can believe it, unfortunately, because she just wasn't acting.
The storyline was good and definitely unusual. A woman and a gay man having a baby and then she decides to get married which causes all kinds of problems.

For once, I think I should have listened to the critics.  This movie was just awful.  About ten minutes into watching it, my husband and I debated turning it off, but the frugal side of us won over.
I am a Madonna fan.  The only movie I have watched with her has been ""Desperately Seeking Susan"", which I don't think was much of a stretch for her.  In ""The Next Best Thing"", she comes across very stiff and uncomfortable to the camera.  She even looks well past her 40 years of age due to harsh light.  But that's beside the point.  The point is she was not comfortable in this role and it shows.  It seems as though she was dubbed as lot as well.  And the fake English accent was horrendous.  My husband and I agreed that she was awful in the beginning and end, however, she seemed to relax in the middle.  Maybe they shot the beginning and ending scenes first?  That might explain it.
Rupert Everett is typically charming, yet I still had trouble caring about his character.  His relationship with Madonna seemed forced, not natural.  And his behavior at the end, although some people may find it justified, made me dislike his character even more.  Benjamin Bratt seemed to be the only natural actor in this movie - too bad he couldn't save it.
I cannot fathom that while making this the director, producer, etc. thought that this movie was worthwhile.  Perhaps with another actress it could have been better?  We'll never know.  All I do know is that I never want to watch this movie again.  As my husband so eloquently put, ""That's an hour and a half I'll never get back.""",983750400,,1862,4.430678466076696
3415003,2,B00004U5S1,"The story and promotional material of ""The Next Best Thing"" raises many expectations... so many, in fact, that it ruins a good portion of what is supposed to be a heartfelt film of acceptance and the struggle between best friends. The story is somewhat faulty, but the real damper in this film is the acting, which seems flat and lifeless, adding no emotion or heart to a movie that centers around those key feelings. Another ruinous aspect is the lifestyle in which the characters reside, which is much to exorbitant and mismatched for their jobs....  Robert, a homosexual construction worker who is tired of all the sex and ""body obsession"" that comes along with his lifestyle. Now tell me something: does it not seem a little hypocritical that he complains about body obsession, yet his physique is shown in its glorious form more that its fair share throughout the movie? That's not the end of it; he is best friends with a woman named Abbie, who is a yoga instructor and runs her own classes. This role is played out by Madonna, who seems to be having a lot of trouble in deciding which of her many fake accents to use throughout the film. She never reaches the mark of mediocre acting, much less fine acting, and instead comes across as sounding consigned and drab, adding no life to her character. Even when she cries, you know she's really pushing for tears.
The story somewhat picks up when Abbie, upset over her recent breakup with her two-year boyfriend Kevin, and sensible Robert have one too many drinks on the night of the Fourth of July and end up making love, or having sex (we never really know how it turns out; the screen fades black). They wake the next morning, and immediately have an argument about who put the moves on who first the previous evening. This is a waste of scene, especially in the dialogue, where the wit and witticism of Everett is totally wasted of Madonna's unenthused retorts. They go on a hiatus from seeing one another, until Robert makes the ultimate sacrifice of calling her and sending her a plant (original, yet dull).
Could the plant be symbolic of events to come? Not even close. If we haven't seen at least one metaphorical meaning yet, we're likely never to encounter one down the road. Abbie discovers that she is pregnant, but never stops to think for one second that the baby is not Robert's (ah, how easy we forget two years of sex). They both agree to give the child a happy and loving home, which will require living together. After Abbie has the baby (which uses one of the most over-used childbirth one-liners ever), the movie skips ahead seven years to the present, even though it seems like we've been in one place the whole time. We see the happy family together among friends, but be forewarned: this is the only real time they ever spend any time together. After this point, the movie spirals into a shameful third act of Robert's jealousy over Abbie's new relationship, and a custody battle that goes nowhere in terms of plot development.
What makes this movie work? Nothing, if you sit down and think about it. The movie is supposed to be about family, and the values of a family that is different from you average family. How are we supposed to see how they get along in one house if the only time we get for that is in between the arguments of the adults and the beginning of the second half? Instead, we are left with nothing but a cavalcade of Abbie's relentless whining about the absence of love from her life, Robert's ongoing will to hold onto a child that is not even his own, and occasional intervals that involve a lifeless Neil Patrick Harris as Robert's friend and confidante. He does nothing for the film on any level; he is just simply thrown into the mix, along with such actors as Lynn Redgrave and Benjamin Bratt, whom we never really get to know.
There always seems to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon for this movie, and just when it seems like something good is going to happen, it becomes hampered by plot twists and crappy dialogue that add nothing but running time to the movie. The third act, or the courtroom battle, is the most ludicrous of these twists. The whole premise of the movie is supposed to be about best friends working things out together. So why drag us through an entire courtroom sequence that does nothing but make us lose more feeling for the characters?
The acting is some of the most flat and dull performances I've seen in a movie in a long time. It makes no sense that Madonna is placed in such a role; this is a huge step down from her character in ""Evita,"" and she plays out Abbie as if she knows this is true. She is never really able to show any true emotion, and while she looks like she is right at home with the role, it makes the rest of the movie suffer and dwindle. Rupert Everett is sometimes emotional and enlightening as Robert, though his wit and humor, while adding a small degree of charm, do virtually nothing to salvage it. Supporting actors are hardly worth mentioning more than they already have been, because we never really get a chance to know them, therefore, we cannot care for them at all.
Through the marketing criteria, the movie is made to seem like something so much more than it really is. But, although it looks good on the outside, ""The Next Best Thing"" is a grab bag of leftover plotlines and flimsy dialogue all thrown together to create something that really doesn't have as great an impact as it aspires to have.",983577600,,5466,4.5212121212121215

It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it.

3415005,3,B00004U5S1,"I wanted to hate this movie because I'm no fan of Madonna, but also because its platitudes against traditional families are themselves old fashioned.  (It's hard to get uptight when the biggest act of rebellion the friends of an AIDS victim can aspire to is to break into a slow chorus of ""American Pie at his funeral).  In the film, Maddona and Rupert Everett play best friends in a dreamy LA when, one night in a drunken frenzy, they conceive a baby and decide to stick it out.  Not amrrying, they decide to become parents nonetheless, never realizing how these seemingly unconnected aspects of their relationship will tear them apart.  After a few years pass, and the baby grows into boyhood, Abbie's (Madonna) relationship with an ambitious but otherwise completely genial investment banker (Ben Bratt) threatens to tear apart what was never a solidly defined family.  A court battle ensues, ala Kramer v. Kramer, and it's never clear which side is supposed to be representing the love of a child over family convention.
The plot never really gels, and Rupert Everett's charachter loses something in the last third when he becomes more confrontational, and less fun-loving than in the film's opening (or in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"").  Maddonna is a revelation, though.  She can't act, but Abbie's charachter touches a nerve that not even Maddonna can resist: aging.  When you watch Abbie grouse over wrinkles and sagging in a mirror, sadly admitting it's not 1989 anymore, you'll be willing to forgive every line of cheesy acting she's ever read.

For example: she showed us great acting in the restaurant scene and when she came home from her date. Also, when she met Ben Bratt's character. the scenes with the child were also great. Madonna showed her talent for children,it's not like she didn't have any practice. The scenes where Madonna's acting isn't so good are: The 4th of July dance with Rupert's character. It's obvious that it's just an act. Also the scenes where Abbie is suposed to cry or to be upset. Madonna just wasn't very convincable in those scenes. She really doesn't know how to act that out in a film. All in all, she had more acting highlights then downfalls in this movie and I was plesently surprised.

This movie was thrown together, and many of the people in it are not even part of the story line.  Although I could follow the story line (the plot is not that difficult to undertand) most of the movie carried no logic. It flowed like broken glass, and felt like it too! The characters are completely stupid, and their behavior is very odd.

3415009,1,B00004U5S1,"...the best would be if it was never made as it was.
Thestory idea is silly. ...
Rupert Everett plays a very stereotypicalgay man and Madonna plays a self-absorbed yoga teacher.  Their actingis mediocre since the material they are working with is terrible. When the woman's first boyfriend in the movie dumps her, he also heapston of praise on her which sounds more like character description in aHarlequin novel.
Another poor facet of the writing is the use ofneedless characters.  What did Neal Patrick Harris' character even addto the film?  What of the man who died?  It seemed as if the dead manwas only mentioned so the characters would have an excuse to sing, asMadonna's character called it, ""Don McLean's 'AmericanPie',"" which seems as silly as refering to a song as ""PaulMcCartney's 'Yesterday'.""
Well, okay, Rupert's acting isterrible due to the writing.  With Madonna, we also get to hear thatannoying ever-changing fake Brit accent in the film.
There were somegood things about this film.  Madonna contributed a wonderful originalsong, ""Time Stood Still."" The cinematography was alsostrong.  So I guess if one could mute the film except for the onesong, it'd be a decent film.
It's hard to believe that the directorwas ever an Oscar contender by looking at this film atrocity.
As forthe DVD itself, I wasn't able to get the trailers to work on one of myDVD players.  The featurette gives more praise to the film than anactual ""making-of"" would have done, tho.
If you're adie-hard Madonna fan, you'll probaby want this movie, but it is amongher worst (Considering that list includes ""Foor Rooms"" and""Shanghai Surprise"" that is no easy feat).  How RupertEverett could be a part of this is beyond me.  But overall, it's a sadrevelation of just how far director John Schlesinger fell.",978739200,,1793,5.027027027027027
3415010,2,B00004U5S1,"After watching this DVD I felt like asking what would be the ""next best thing"" -- hopefully a better movie.  At best this is a mediocre film, a fairly ineffective mix of comedy, drama, and romance.  Despite being friends in real life, Madonna and Rupert Everett have little chemistry (Everett was a much more appealing gay gal pal to Julia Roberts in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"").  We know these actors (along with Benjamin Bratt) can do better and perhaps it is the script that is to blame. Towards the end of the movie there is a sudden plot twist -- if the viewing audience was clued into this earlier it would have created more tension until it was eventually unveiled. While it is a betrayal to one of the characters it is likewise one to viewers.  Without giving anything away, the turn of events is based on something that should have been common knowledge to any informed/involved parent (which the movie professes both parties are).  Additionally, there are the usual (and admittedly nit-picky) film head-scratchers like how could a yoga instructor possibly afford a beautiful home like that in LA area?
The extras on this DVD are fairly negligible.  There are extended interviews with the cast and director (Madonna seems a bit on guard) and Madonna's video for ""American Pie"" (Interesting cover version or musical blasphemy?  You make the call!).  Overall, a disappointment for the talent involved.",978480000,,1408,4.9113924050632916

3415012,3,B00004U5S1,"Forget about diamonds. `The Next Best Thing' is dedicated to the proposition that a gay man is really a girl's best friend. But, man, can that make life complicated! Madonna stars as Abbie, a Southern California yoga instructor who just can't seem to find that certain someone to provide her with marriage and a child but who, at the same time, hears her biological clock ticking ominously down. Rupert Everett plays Robert, her gay best friend, whom Abbie leans upon for support in times of grave romantic crisis - which seems to be just about her normal state of affairs. One night the two get a little too drunk and frisky and end up consummating their friendship, an act that leads to Abbie's pregnancy and a decision between the two to move in together and raise the child as mother and father but not husband and wife. All goes fairly well for six years or so until Abbie falls in love with a young New York executive who wants to marry her and move the three of them away from Los Angeles and the man Sammy thinks of as his father. This leads to a complex court battle between the principals as the suddenly antagonistic best friends struggle over custody of their child.
In this day and age when less traditional relationships and families abound in our society, credit `The Next Best Thing' with at least trying to come to terms with some of the unintended and unforeseen consequences that result when well-meaning people wind up in overly complicated situations. We see that Abbie obviously has strong feelings for this man she knows she can never have, while Robert feels inexplicable stirrings of jealousy when Abbie begins to develop an interest in her new beau. We also see the difficulties faced by little Sammy as he begins to grow up and be questioned by his little friends about the unconventional relationship of his parents. (However, this interesting theme is dealt with in only the most superficial way before it is conveniently swept under the carpet). As the film examines the setup from its many different angles and perspectives, it attempts to deal fairly with the principal characters involved. No one is made out to be the heavy or the villain, yet, at the same time; all the characters have their moments of unreasonable selfishness. The main problem with `The Next Best Thing,' however, is that it is attempting to address these really serious issues in the context of a lighthearted romantic comedy. As a result, the plotting seems somehow more contrived than it might if it were developed along the lines of a serious social drama. We never really believe any of it, partly because the film seems to spend more of its time displaying and lingering over the truly phenomenal bodies of its three main actors than exploring the depth of their characters. It all seems so surface slick, replete with a too-cozy happy ending done in summary written codas flashed on the screen immediately prior to the closing credits.
Madonna and Everett are both physically very attractive performers - a real boon to the 40+ actors set that doesn't seem to get too much work in the movie romance department these days. As an actress, Madonna has certainly come a long way from her truly wretched performances in the early part of her film career. In this film, except when she is called upon to cry - in which case, she is still incredibly unconvincing - she does seem to have a more relaxed presence on the screen than she has had previously. Everett looks as though he would much rather be sinking his teeth into a far meatier role, but, given the material he has to work with, he does a serviceable job. Oddly enough, this film contains a host of secondary characters who pop up so infrequently or disappear entirely with no explanation that one wonders either why they were included in the first place or at what stage between scriptwriting and final editing they lost their way. This sloppiness and the overall timidity and slickness of the film are particularly surprising given the fact that director John Schlesinger was once responsible for such classic edgy works as ""Darling"" and ""Midnight Cowboy"" in the 1960's.
`The Next Best Thing' has its heart in the right place and its twisting/turning plot structure, built on the complex emotional needs of its character, carries the audience along fairly nicely. We can identify with these people because, although they seem well meaning, they are also way over their heads with the cards life has dealt them. Who among us cannot empathize with that situation? A pity, then, that `The Next Best Thing' didn't provide a bit more serious context in which to explore it.",972777600,,4635,4.766169154228856

It seemed like such a great story that with the right people involved could be fun. Madonna isn't the worlds greatest actress but this wasn't high drama. I figured she could pull it of. I just wasn't convinced that she was a victim of loves tragedies. She looked so old and what was with the accent? Isn't she from Detroit? This was not the best effort by Rupert Evertt who was excellent in An Ideal Husband and My Best Friends Wedding. I belive he suffered more from the horrible writing than a lack of acting ability. Whoever wrote this must have missed a prozac pill or two because just when your used to the slowness of the story it goes to a dark depressing place. Just when the audience doesn't care what happens to either of the charectors the film takes a turn you don't expect and don't even care about anymore.

I also like the way they demolished that gay couples place. It was so funny. The dialouge was real. It wasn't contrived and intellectual like when Madonna has conversations with her bubble headed girlfriends. The movie wasn't phony to me. Like most of the movies I see Merle Streep in.

I think  that Madonna did the best she could with this role.

Plus it hardly has a happy ending.  Gay man and straight woman try to  raise young son... all is not well on the homefront!
Madonna, first off  looks horrid. Despite a well toned body, she has become frightening for me  to look at.  Though her acting is always slightly above average, the trite  dialogue is not pulled off by either her or the always fine performances of  Rupert Everett.
On another note, I'm actually beginning to believe that  Neil Patrick Harris is gay.  (Didn't he turn up on Will & Grace last  season?) This actor is so talented!  After all, we all believed that Doogie  Howser really WAS a doctor!  His emotional performance of a man that looses  his lover to AIDS should not go unnoticed.

abomination'.
I couldn't agree more. The direction is shockingly
amateurish, and the performance of Madonna is disturbing - just
because we get to see that what little spark we saw in 'Evita' was
just fluke. She is not an actress. That said, you can sit down to this
film with the knowledge that nothing interesting will ever happen, and
that the films grand statement on gay parenting is both sad and
disillusioning.
Rupert is bearable as Robert, his natural good looks
and ease with the camera make him eye candy, and he does lend his role
some sense of dignity. Indeed, one of the better and more thought
provoking scenes in the film is when Robert is in bed with his
cardiologist boyfriend. Certainly not because of the trite dialogue,
however.
Also, the child they got to play Madonna's son is
unbearable. Obviously, if Madonna and Rupert had a child together, it
would NOT look that gross. And whats with 'American Pie' playing in
the background for most part of the film. Madonna also sings it at a
funeral of a gay friend, and this scene is unintentionally
comic. Though at the end of it, the only word to use is 'pathetic'. So
sad to see aging performer make wrong movie role choices. At least
Everett should have known better.
And Benjamin Bratt looks like a
ten dollar male gigolo minus the sex appeal. Now, THATS an
insult. Save your money, and catch something far better, and something
that doesn't insult your intelligence as much as this one
does. Something like 'South Park' or 'Pamela Anderson's 10 minute
boobie-lifts'.",966902400,,1603,4.745519713261649

I was so mad-I thought ""This is totally  twisted-it is too stupid!"".  If you want to see a good Madonna movie,  skip ""The Next Best Thing"" and grab ""Evita"".",964656000,,810,4.719424460431655
3415026,4,B00004U5S1,"Actually, I'd give it three ana half stars if I could. I went to see this at the movies. I thought it was great. Then, I rented a similar movie called ""The Object of My Affection"" which was better in many ways  but this was still not a bad movie. Madonna I thought gave a very good  performance... better than her acting in ""Evita"" (which,  ironically, that one which I've seen done a hundred times better on stage  was praised by the critics). The actors in the film have never looked  better... it's almost like the old Hollywood movies where everyone has star  quality but it has more modern themes. I think it almost needs to be viewd  though as if it's two acts. Act One is a sitcom about these two best  friends. Act Two is a drama about these two friends raising a child. I'm so  sick of critics saying it couldn't decide if it was comedy or drama. You'll  laugh. You'll cry a little... which means the movie did its job. It makes  its audience feel.",963964800,,957,4.290502793296089
3415027,5,B00004U5S1,"When I first heard about this movie and its story I felt very moved by it. But when I started reading the negative critics about it, I felt it maybe wasn't so nice as I thought it would be. But I went to the cinema and  watched it. And then realized that I wasn't wrong about the movie because  it is great! From the sountrack to its images and actor's performances,  everything is cool. Some people said that the end of it was poor and  previsible, but I desagree. The final shows that if you really care about  someone, sometimes it's necessary to forgive, forget the past and go on  with life. And that's what happens in the movie. Madonna did a very good  job such as Rupert and the rest of the cast. Have a really fun time while  watching! If you have enough maturity to undertand, watch it! I'm certain  that you'll enjoy!",963792000,,828,4.290322580645161
3415028,4,B00004U5S1,"I went to see this movie, and I must say had my doubts about it after reading all the trash that has been produced, but to my surprise I found a funny and I must say beautifully filmed movie, with a more than ever  relaxed performing Madonna, once again the critics were eager to judge this  movie and even worse Madonna, my guess is that it does't seem to matter  what she does (when acting) they allready jump to conclusions without even  watching with an open eye and open mind and might for once try to forget to  reflect everything on her real life, well maybe she's just too much an Icon  and image, anyway I loved it and Madonna in it ! And I will surely order  this movie on DVD !",963532800,,688,4.12781954887218
3415029,4,B00004U5S1,"I went to the cinema earlier today to see this film.  To be honest I wasn't expecting to enjoy it after the slating that it has been given by the critics, and if it wasn't for the fact that my boyfriend is a Madonna  fan then we wouldn't have bothered.
HOW WRONG COULD I BE.....It was  excellent, the storyline was brilliant, really felt for Rupert Everetts  character.  I was crying halfway through and my boyfriend believe it or not  was tearful at the end.  Infact he was so moved by it that he has gone  tonight to watch it again and we have already ordered the DVD from  AMAZON.
My advice - ignore the critics, watch it for yourself and  thoroughly enjoy it.  We actually came up with theory that if Meg Ryan or  Julia Roberts had played Madonna's part then it would have had rave  reviews.  Ok so Madonna may not be the best actress in the world but that  aside the film was not the next best thing.  It was the best  thing!",961977600,,930,4.222857142857142
3415030,3,B00004U5S1,"I don't quite understand why this film has received such negative reviews. I went to see it, with the fear of God having been injected into me. However, what I discovered was a very enjoyable and thought-provoking film  about problems faced in the world today. Madonna and Rupert Everett did a  good job, although, I have to ask - what is with Madonna's accent? Anyway,  a good film which I'll buy..",961891200,,399,4.591549295774648
3415031,4,B00004U5S1,"Okay, so she's no Meryl Streep but Madonna is not a bad actress!  This film proves it.  She does a fine job as does the rest of the cast.  But, she isn't the centerpiece of the movie, so I really don't see why all the  slings and arrows from critics are about her acting.  The movie does a good  job provoking thought about the issues it explores:  what is the definition  of a ""family"" in our society today, should a convention family be  the mold we all follow, should a gay man have as much parental rights as a  straight man etc.  There's a good blend of comedy and drama.  The movie is  no ""Titanic"" but it's still good entertainment, a nice diversion.  Fun in the beginning, sad towards the climax, touching by the end.  Immitates real life quite a bit.  It should fare much better on video.",961632000,,797,4.283783783783784
3415032,4,B00004U5S1,"Madonna is a real  movie star and she proved that on this movie. She plays the role of a single mother( Abby )and in every scene  you could see that she enjoyed not been the super female icon role and just been a mother who  wants the best for her son.  The movie is fantastic . The first part is  very funny and step by step  took the drama with it and the release end is  one memorable and simply.
You have to wacth it if you don't and buy it if  you haven't.",961459200,,461,3.8297872340425534
3415033,5,B00004U5S1,"Madonna's acting was great in this movie. I hated Madonna (But in real life I love her) on how she took San (Their Love Child) away from Robert (Evertt) and treated him. Madonna (Abby) plays a yoga teacher whom has  prolbem in the love area of her life. One night with a good cry with  Robert, too many drinks, lead to a night of passion. The movie moves on and  she meets this guy (Can't remember his name) and they fall in love. Then  she decide to run away with her new lover to New York, but Robert get  pissed and sued Abby. She later tell him that Sam is not his child that Sam  real dad is the last guy she was with (That was when I got pissed at  Madonna) and then......I should not say anymore, I don't want to spoil it  for you. But it was and is a great movie. I will buy it when it comes out.",961200000,,804,3.919753086419753
3415034,5,B00004U5S1,"MADONNA did a Great job! THE NEXT BEST THING is a GREAT movie! Madonna plays a women named Abby who happens to get pregnant by her best friend Robert (Rupert Everett) who is gay. Now after a few to many drinks the two  end up having sex, and you guessed it Abby gets pregnant. Now Abby and  Robert have agreed to live together and raise there son Sam together, but  there is a unexpected turn of events when Abby meets a Guy named Ben  (Benjamin Bratt) and the two just seem to hit it off. Robert suddenly finds  himself in a horrible position when Abby and Ben tell him they are going to  get married, move out of state and take Sam with them. Now Robert then does  what he has to do to keep his son from moving, however he discovers a  Horriblre hidden truth along the way. Now i will not say any more other  than this movie is one of the Best MADONNA movies ever! MADONNA does a  amazing acting job despite what some of the critics said, but what do they  know anyway! It's us the MOVIE GOERS that ultimatly know a GOOD movie when  we see one. THE NEXT BEST THING is a GREAT MOVIE with many laughs and many  tears! I highly recommend this Movie!",960940800,,1148,4.14027149321267
3415035,4,B00004U5S1,"This may not be the next best thing, but it is entertaining and deals with issues that most of us are faced with on a daily basis. It shows that gay people are no different to any one else and deep down they want stability,  a home and the opportunity to raise children. The other issue dealt with  involves using children as a tool when a relationship / marriage hits the  rocks. All to often it is the children that suffer and this film brings the  message across that no matter who or what you are or what happens in a  relationship, think of the childrens needs above all else, after all the  children are innocent pawns. So, wether you are gay or straight, this movie  is highly recommended. Rupert Everett is a great performer of which Madonna  is not, but somehow they manage to pull this flawed movie through.",960768000,,817,4.4
