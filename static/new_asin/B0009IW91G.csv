2293171,5,B0009IW91G,"One Step Beyond quickly became a favorite show of mine after purchasing this set. Your host, John Newland, is like Rod Serling with a sense of humor. The difference between Twilight Zone and this is that the stories that they present are supposedly ""based on acutal events"" of paranormal and psychic phenomenon, so you get a whole different twist of spookiness. However, the stories are not presented as ""believe this"" but more as ""do you believe this?"". Many fine actors and actresses put in an appearance here. The only thing that is wrong with this set is the transfer. The quality is not the greatest in either picture or sound. Regardless of these problems, the set is amazing and worth a watch by any true sci-fi fan.",1274572800,,723,4.700787401574803
2293172,4,B0009IW91G,"This set is good, but even better is Delta's expanded 12 disc set.

Also check out VCI's One Step Beyond 2-disc set, it has episodes not on Delta's 12 & 8 disc sets.",1180310400,,165,4.0
2293173,4,B0009IW91G,"This was an entertaining little series.  The quality of the prints actuall aid in the enjoyment of the episodes.  If you do not expect high quality or high talent, this would be a good purchase at a good price.",1173312000,,210,4.358974358974359
2293174,1,B0009IW91G,"They claim that One Step Beyond (ABC, 1959-61) episodes came from real stories of people they interviewed.  Most of the stories are uninteresting, bland and without a big payoff.  The only interestt of this DVD 2-disc set are the actors we know now who were at the beginning of their acting careers when they did One Step Beyond. Other actors are fun to see because they were so much younger.

  In any case, Alfred Hitchcock Presents (CBS, 1955-60, NBC 1960-62), The Twilight Zone (CBS 1959-64) and sometimes The Outer Limits (ABC 1963-65) were far more superior, high quality and dramatic than One Step Beyond.
  Correction: In the Robert Blake bio and Facts & trivia of Disc one, it is mentioned that Robert Blake was arrested for the murder of his wife, whom they had a daughter together.  What they do not say is Robert Blake was acquitted of all charges. case unsolved. As of 2006, Robert Blake raises sheep and likes to travel on his own free will.
  Mr. Blake is still fondly remembered in his role as a cop in the ABC tv series ""Baretta"" (1975-76). That damn cockatoo.",1171670400,,1532,5.096
2293175,5,B0009IW91G,"This is a great series.

Loved it. Great sampling of the Series.

Reccommended to all fans of One Step Beyond",1170720000,,109,4.4
2293176,5,B0009IW91G,"If you like this kind of thing in general, don't miss this one.  These are old black and white TV shows from just about the earliest days of television.  In the case of One Step Beyond, each show was a reenactment of a supposedly true story.  It is really amazing what odd news stories turn up from time to time.  The really odd ones usually only run in local newspapers, nobody knows what to think of them, and they more or less just go away because they involve ""impossible"" claims - apparitions, premonitions, time slips, and so on.  This still happens today, and it always has.  So, anyway, back in the 1950s these people made a series of TV shows out of these weird reports and they made a really good go of it.  One Step Beyond.  I ordered it expecting that I would enjoy it.  I ended up being even happier than expected.  Quite good.  Five stars for sure.",1165276800,,862,4.325
2293177,5,B0009IW91G,"I recommend this collection not only as a good value for the money, but old black and white mysteries about the unexplainable are perfect for those of us who are jaded by today's inability to tell a story without gunfire and squirting guts.",1157068800,,240,4.604651162790698
2293178,3,B0009IW91G,this is a great show! if you like the twilight zone this is a must.  the price is very good but i think that the 8 disc set is the best you can get.,1156896000,,148,3.3529411764705883
2293179,5,B0009IW91G,I searched all over for a good deal on a one step beyond box set but couldn't find any better then this one. it is cheap for the amount of episodes on it compared to the other sets. the show is great for old sci-fi fans and twilight zone fans.,1155945600,,243,3.88
2293180,3,B0009IW91G,"Good selection of episodes leaves me waiting for a followup set.

Transfers were fair to good relative to original TV broadcast quality of the day with only one episode difficult to view due to its dark constrast. The Peter Hurkos story, parts one and two I felt most credible and recognizable. On, my wish list is the remainder of the 97 episodes aired.",1152489600,,354,4.619047619047619
2293181,5,B0009IW91G,"As a 'baby boomer' I can remember growing up watching this eerie show.  When I saw the great price on this special 8 DVD special edition which featured over 13 hours of shows, I had to find out if it was as good as I remembered.  As I did my research on One Step Beyond,I found out that not only was John Newland the host of the show, he directed every episode.  Also, One Step Beyond began its TV run about 9 months before The Twilight Zone began airing.
  After viewing all the shows on this set, I can safely say that this set is an outstanding example of what the show was all about----the eerie, the unexplainable, the mysterious.  Yes, the goosebumps came back too. I was very pleased with it.
  The acting, photography, etc. is very good.  While the Twilight Zone relied on tricks, gimmicks and hidden messages, One Step Beyond just stuck to telling what was supposed to be 'a true story'.
  If you buy this edition you will be blown away by the way Delta Entertainment has packaged this set and the imaginative and very unsettling method they used to introduce the programming on each DVD.
  Naturally, Amazon packaged this very well and got it to me within the time they promised.
  I've recently learned that Mill Creek Entertainment has come out with a version entitled,""The Very Best Of One Step Beyond"" which has 50 episodes. I have several DVD movie collections from Mill Creek. The old saying, ""You get what you pay for"", certainly holds true here. Other reviewers have commented on the poor audio and video quality of this collection. I wouldn't doubt it as I've experienced both problems with the Mill Creek products I've purchased. They simply transfer the images to DVD's without bothering to clean things up. They also use very cheap packaging (cardboard box and cardboard sleeves for each DVD).  I purchased them because there was no competition with any of the sets they offered.
  If you are looking for the best you can get for your money, I would suggest this one from Delta Entertainment.",1151884800,,2014,4.625352112676056
2293182,4,B0009IW91G,"This really is a terrific bargain.  13 hours on 8 single-sided, color coded discs so you can tell them apart easier. 4 episodes per disc except disc one (5 episodes). Quality reflects age; looks like they were shot on prototypical video equipment, not film. But transfers are complete and clean. No extras besides menus. Best episodes are ***1/2; most are ** to **1/2. Expect strange stories, not scary. Actors include Patrick Macnee, Cloris Leachman (in a dreadfully bad episode), Reginald Owen, Parnell Roberts, Patrick O'Neal (in ""The Return of Mitchell Campion,"" probably the best episode in the set), Mike Connors, Ross Martin, Suzanne Plashette and Louise Fletcher. Interesting piece of TV history. Not the type of set you blaze through in a couple of days; rather, like a bathroom book, to savor a little bit at a time over several weeks.",1151798400,,845,4.99290780141844
2293183,3,B0009IW91G,"Hi I purchased this Diamond Entertainment 2 dvd set for about $10.00. The quality is right in line with the Diamond name, mainly pretty bad. I suspect there are a lot of edits and material missing so those familiar with the show will be turned off but for me, for 10 bucks, to get a large sampling of this show was a pretty good deal. Episodes are Gypsy, To Know The End, the vision, the sorcerer (Christopher Lee, pretty decent episode), the dark room, the aerialist, encounter, the executioner, the explorer, delusion, ordeal on locust street, the dead part of the house, legacy of love, rendezvous, the last round, the captains guest, echo, front runner, moment of hate, message from clara. Since I don't see titles when the episodes are played I have no idea if these are the episodes included but thats whats on the box. It also says Fully Restored and Enhanced Digital Masters, thats a hoot huh? They recorded these episodes in digital in the 50's now that is one step beyond. I think those who this would most appeal to are those who grew up with the series as they are soo slow almost like a soap opera, compared to shows like Twighlight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Thriller, Outer Limits, I'm glad I only paid 10.00 bucks and I'll probably not repeat viewing these shows.",1151712000,,1285,4.615720524017467
2293184,4,B0009IW91G,"Being a big fan of 50's television and an ardent owner of an iPod was I ever glad to see a marriage of this.  The picture is in fine form and the fact that you can either watch it in it's video format or just listen to it as an old radio program is doubly fantastic!  I own the One Step Beyond box set and believe me it's an excellent foray into television's golden years.  The only reason why this product did not get 5 stars is that it should have been released in its entirety or as complete a set (49) episodes as possible.  Whatever, it's wonderful, I'm glad to have it and I highly recommend it.  Keep them coming...",1151193600,,622,4.107438016528926
2293185,5,B0009IW91G,"If you plan to buy only one One Step Beyond set, this 8-DVD, 13- hour set from June 2005 appears to be the collection to get. You get 33 episodes for 12 bucks. This set is a better deal than the 5-DVD ""One Step Beyond Collection"" (Feb. 2006; 27 bucks). It also is a better deal than the 2004 ""One Step Beyond (12 DVD)"" with about 49 episodes for 81 bucks, or the ""One Step Beyond (8 DVD)"" set for 50 bucks, also released in 2004.

2293186,5,B0009IW91G,"An evening with John Newland's One Step Beyond is every bit as satisfying as one spent reading Conan Doyle. Just as you don't read Sherlock Holmes for the quality of the prose, you don't watch OSB for the ""production values."" Instead, what you get in both instances is a warm feeling that, whatever the problems with the world, there is a readily available force (science for Holmes, the supernatural for OSB) which will put everything to right. Each episode has a ""One Step Beyond Moment"" which sends a shiver of well being through you. These moments can sometimes be quite moving.

This is an important and emotionally peace-inducing message that OSB delivers. These forces unite lovers, warn of pending disasters, bring justice to society. The only time tragedy strikes is when people disregard these warnings. Even the story which I consider the creepiest, The Vanishing Point, where people enter a house and disappear forever, is comforting: the people who disappear (including a Civil War era teacher ostracized for being an abolitionist, a woman facing divorce and, later, her husband accused of her murder)are all unfairly oppressed by society and they find a permanent refuge in the house.

The stories are supposed to be true, carefully vetted by Newland and his staff. This seems to be true, at least with the handful I was able to research independently. The book by the show's advisor, Ivan Klapper's One Hundred Years of the Unexplained, has been out of print (except, according to Amazon, in Japanese) for years now and can not even be found used.

If you want to find the exact moment when the cultural divide began between the rich, neurotic and narcissistic blue states and the middle class, balanced and communitarian red states (or for that matter, when the left evolved from being a progressive force in society to the hedonist and reactionary nihilists they have become), you need only determine the point at which the cultural elites in America began to favor The Twilight Zone over One Step Beyond. The message of the fictional Twilight Zone is that the universe is an evil Hobbesian world where everyone is against you and you'd better live for the moment because the future is unpredictable. The message of the (truthful?) One Step Beyond is that if you tap into the powers of the universe, good will prevail.

You needn't be religious to buy the OSB line, you need only believe in a rational universe. Modern physicists are much closer to accepting the OSB view than are modern social scientists. If you accept the world view of the Twilight Zone, there is no reason to believe in the future, no reason to believe in any selfless act. Survival requires you to hunker down and protect yourself at the expense of all others.

Thus, One Step Beyond is a period piece of a more positive time, but one which still keeps its power today.",1127779200,,2858,4.83640081799591
2293187,4,B0009IW91G,"In the early sixties, they played this show (reruns, I guess) on Saturdays around noon. I remember thinking how frightening it would have been to see this show at night. When you wanted weird you watched The Twilight Zone. When you wanted weirder you watched The Outer Limits. When you wanted downright freaky you watched One Step Beyond,.. preferrably during the daylight hours.",1122595200,,379,5.031746031746032
2293188,5,B0009IW91G,"Finally, a long overdue classic is available on DVD. Instead of relying on the truly fantastic a' la Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, One Step Beyond achieves it's creepiness because of the almost-plausibility of it's stories. Amazing things happening to ordinary people, and they ""really happened.""

I was very disapppointed with this version for the low quality transfer. Avoid this version of the series at all costs, unless you are a true devotee of 'One Step Beyond.'  This DVD transfer is abysmal at best. Some of the introductions and exits of the episodes, and even some of the episodes, are cut short.  The images are dark to very dark at times and are not very clear with unwanted sounds in the background that occur every once in a while. This is a very inexpensive transfer to DVD and leaves a lot to want. I decided to purchase the Paramount DVD, which, from what I read, is superior.",1328400000,,706,4.293233082706767
