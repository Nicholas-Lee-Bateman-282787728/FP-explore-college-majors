1991004,5,B0001DCYBE,"The new DVD format release of this movie has just come out. The picture quality is excellent, and the ""Bonus"" material includes a great commentary by the same narrator who did the other new DVD's of the Universal Holmes' movies, David Stuart Davies.
It sends chills up your spine to realize this was the first appearance of Rathbone and Bruce as Holmes and Watson! They didn't even get top billing!!
There are also some still shots and a movie trailer, but buy this for the picture and sound quality and Davies's commentary.",1083542400,3,524,4.706521739130435
1991005,5,B0001DCYBE,"When I was about 10 or 11 years old I used to love to come home from school and tune into BBC2 to catch a new Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movie. The time was the first couple of years of the 1980s and the British network was screening the movies just in time for kids like myself to see them for the first time.
The first movie was ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" and I was hooked from the moment I saw the death of the elder Baskerville and heard the maids scream.
Here we are over 20 years later and this classic (still my favorite Holmes movie) has finally arrived on DVD. What a triumph! The movie has been lovingly restored and has probably never looked better.
In addition we have an audio commentary track that is insightful and entertaining. Covered is not only background to the production but also biographoical information and discussion of other adaptations of the story for the screen. For its entire 80 minute length I was riveted by the comments of someone who has obviously researched the 1939 movie extensively.
Accompanying his commentary is a glossy booklet by Holmes fan Richard Valley (who does the audio commentary for the second Rathbone Holmes movie ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes""). He covers some of the same information as is detailed by his colleague on the commentary but overall the handsome booklet is another nice look at the story and this version.
Also listed as special features on the disc is a photo gallery and poster gallery. It is a shame however that one cannot manually scroll through them, instead we have various stills and posters panned over by the camera to the strains of music.
A real find on the DVD is vintage trailers for some of the Rathbone Holmes advantures, curiously though they are from the later Universal movies and missing is ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" trailer.
Overall though this is a very well put together DVD and I am elated to finally have my favorite Sherlock Holmes movie on DVD!",1083196800,3,1960,4.651296829971182
1991006,5,B0001DCYBE,In regards to other reviewers queries this movie as well as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were not restored like the Universal set's were. Possibly the original negatives of these were kept and were in good condition so the retransferring to digital with modern equipment made it look as good as the Universal set's restoration work. UCLA actually created new film negatives from sources found around the world. If you have the original negatives in good condition then scouring the world for other sources to create a new negative is rather superfluous when it is unlikely to acheive results that are that much better than a good original print. That said there are always digital improvements that can be made afterwards.,1082592000,3,727,5.016528925619835
1991007,4,B0001DCYBE,"20th Century Fox's 1939 production of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" wasn't the first film based on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel, but as the first Sherlock Holmes film set in the Victorian Era in which the master sleuth was so perfectly at home, it is a landmark. More importantly, it also marked the first appearance of Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.
Previous screen versions of the Conan Doyle tales brought Holmes into the 20th century, but without emphasizing the modern trappings as much as Universal would in their series of films beginning in 1942. There is much to admire in this version, particulary Rathbone, the actor so perfectly cast that he would never succeed in distancing himself from the Great Detective of 221 B Baker Street. The screenplay by Ernest Pascal is generally faithful to the novel, and the cast is superb with such masters of menace as Lionel Atwill and John Carradine offering excellent support.
The fog-shrouded moors are impressive (though less so when compared to the moors of Universal's ""The Scarlet Claw""), but the producers made one misstep by assigning Sidney Lanfield to direct. Better known for musicals and comedies, genres to which he would return in the future (including several Bob Hope comedies), Lanfield fails to conjure the sense of mystery for which the later Universal films, directed by Roy William Neill, would so brilliantly achieve. But if this version of the tale just misses the mark as a masterpiece, it is still very good indeed. It was also daring at the time by acknowledging, in its final line of dialogue, one of the master detective's less admirable habits.
Not surprisingly for its era, the film gives Richard Greene, the handsome Sir Henry Baskerville, top billing over the film's true star, and posters for the film's original release emphasized Greene and co-star Wendy Barrie at Basil Rathbone's expense. But it is Rathbone, more than anything else in ""Hound,"" that makes it worthwhile. The cinema had found its greatest Sherlock Holmes, and no actor since has ever threatened Rathbone's claim to the role.

1991008,5,B0001DCYBE,"With the release of this feature and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" all 14 classic films by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce will have finally been released in a quality DVD format. The UCLA Theatre Archives has done an outstanding job in restoring and thus preserving these great films from 35mm master copies into the digital format, sometimes literally being forced to piece together the celluloid remnants they found. It took the archivists years to complete the entire project, but is well worth the wait. The result is that the black and white images seem as fresh today as when the films were released to theatres more than 40 years ago. The archivists deserve a hearty thanks from all movie fans concerned with preserving America's classic cinema heritage for future generations to enjoy.
Atmospherically, ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is arguably the best of the 14 Holmes films, and the only one based specifically on a Conan Doyle story. It, and ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" are the only two ""period"" films in the series and run longer, the remainder taking place in then modern-day England and America of the late 30s and early 40s and run about 90 minutes each. In both ""Hound"" and ""Adventures,"" Holmes dons his deerstalker cap, popularized by original Strand Magazine illustrator Sidney Paget who made the image synonymous with the great detective. It is interesting to note that in the first of the non-period films in the series, Holmes reaches for his handy deerstalker, but is stopped by Watson. ""Holmes,"" Watson said, ""you promised."" Leaving the deerstalker on the peg, Holmes grabs a ""modern"" hat instead.
Rathbone is especially sharp in ""Hound of the Baskervilles,"" and is partnered by Bruce, who plays a bumbling Watson throughout the 14 films that was not Conan Doyle's vision of the great
sleuth's biographical ""Boswell."" Nonetheless, the pairing is hugely entertaining and satisfying.
The creation of the moor, the sinister grimpen mire and truly terrifying hound remains fantastic and does much to engender this story as one of Conan Doyle's most popular with modern-day
readers and viewers alike.
The final scene represents the only reference any of the 14 films made to Holmes' ""seven-percent"" cocaine habit as Rathbone asks Bruce to retrieve ""the needle."" The scene, criticized as too risque by 1939 audiences, caused the film's producers to make a conscious decision to omit any additional mention of Holmes' recreational drug use in future outings.
I only wish that Rathbone and Bruce had lived to see their great work released to new audiences in this pristine DVD condition.",1079049600,94,2621,5.097674418604651

1991117,5,B0001DCYBE,"There were many actors who played the great sleuth and his companion/biographer but none were as memorable as Basil Rathbone, who was also a great swashbuckler villain, and Nigel Bruce, son of a baron and grandson of a Royal Artillery general.

Besides the 1939-'46 film series, Bruce also played Dr. Watson over 200 times on the radio. He and Rathbone were close friends. (BTW, although his Watson appears older thatn Rathbone's Holmes, Basil was actually Nigel's senior by three years.)

Neither of these very-British men were born in the Isles. Bruce came to life in Baja, Mexico, while Rathbone was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. The latter's stage career was Shakespearean, debuting in 1911 in ""The Taming of the Shrew."" He also starred with Bruce in the radio series, but only until their last Holmes picture debuted.

An interesting bit of trivia: Basil's distant cousin, Maj. Henry Rathbone attended Ford's Theater with the Lincolns the night the President was fatally shot. Rathbone was badly wounded by J.W. Booth, who slashed his arm to the bone before jumping to the stage from the Presidential box/

.
From that greatest motion picture year of 1939, this version of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is the best-known of many. It's also the very first Rathbone/Bruce collaboration. Oddly, FOX Studios, expecting little from this film, top-billed romantic lead Richard Greene over Rathbone while Greene's romantic interest, Wendy Barrie was third above Bruce.

This and the second FOX Holmes effort,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ADVENTURES-OF-SHERLOCK-HOLMES/dp/B0001DCYB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES</a>&nbsp;(1939) were set in Victorian England, but after UNIVERSAL acquired the rights early in 1942, they updated the setting to modern times.

I was VERY disappointed with the remakes with different actors as the team. There were other Baskerville movies that were closer to the book, (I.E. MISS Stapleton was in all actuality MRS. Stapleton, (But by her husbands will, she pretended to be his sister,) But in this version of the story she really was Mr. Stapletons' sister.) Even so, this is my FAVORITE version of the movie.

The first recorded victim of the Hound was Sir Hugo Baskerville, a ""Godless, Profane Man"" who owned Baskerville Hall. According to the ""Legend"", many other Baskervilles met ""Gruesome, untimely, deaths."" Then Sir Charles Baskerville, one of the last of the Baskerville family, died under mysterious circumstances. His best friend, Dr. Mortimer, came to Sherlock Holmes to enlist his aid in protecting the last of the Baskerville family, Sir Henry Baskerville.

Barryman's wife gives some old clothes to a beggar. A man watches with a spyglass.

Watosn goes to that old stone hut and meets that peddler. Sherlock explains his use of a ruse to operate undercover and learn about the situation. They hear the hound how. They see Sir Henry on the ground! [Note how people can be recognized by their clothes.] Next Stapleton arrives, he heard the noise. [Note his facial expression.] Sherlock tells Mrs. Barryman about her brother. He learns about Sir Henry's plan to marry Beryl. Sherlock inspects a portrait of Sir Hugo! What did he see? He and Watson announce their return to London. But this is another ruse, they will double back to catch the criminal in the act.

Sir Henry will cross the moor at night. [Watch Beryl's facial expression - does she know?] We see Jack taking things from his desk and go outside. The hound chases Sir Henry! Sherlock and Watson shoot at the hound to drive it off. Sherlock follows the trail with his lamp. By now you know who the murderer is. How will he be caught? ""That's our man."" That officially closes the case. Sherlock gives all England a sense of security. [This is 1939.]

While I still find the whole breakdown of things to be rather underwhelming (when all is said and done, I wanted a little more `wow' in the end), I must admit that the film still sends shivers in the right moments and carries some eerily effecting set pieces with stunning cinematography that totally captures the mood of the film.  Basil Rathbone was a natural in this role, and he served it well many times over.  Of all the Sherlock Holmes films, `The Hound of the Baskervilles' is probably the one most remembered, and why not; it packs a serious punch while remaining surprisingly lighthearted in all the right areas, serving up a classic blend of suspense and charm.",1301616000,2,899,4.60625
1991251,4,B0001DCYBE,"Basil Rathbone was at the very height of his career when he first took on the role that would ensure his eternal fame, Sherlock Holmes in the first of 13 films, made initially for Fox and then for Universal, from 1939-1946. He had been nominated twice for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar within the previous three years, and starred in Son of Frankenstein and The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1938; what more could a great actor who was not blessed with a matinee idol appearance ask for? But Holmes was a character he grew up with, and one he seemed born to play. The thin, hawkish counenance, the rail-thin body and athletic stance, the deep and commanding voice, and the mastery of makeup all served him in good stead; while partisans of Jeremy Brett can make good claims for their man, Rathbone is probably the guy I'd choose as the single exemplary Holmes. Certainly the movies are fun, and Rathbone seemed to enjoy himself, particularly in the early ones.

This first pairing of Rathbone and his Watson, Nigel Bruce, is taken from a later Holmes story, and possibly the most famous, with the detective and doctor trying to prevent the likely murder of young Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene), heir to an estate in Dartmoor and returned from an upbringing in Canada after the mysterious death of his uncle. We've got all kinds of sinister characters who could be behind the problems at Baskerville Hall - the dark and spooky Barryman (John Carradine) the butler and his unpleasant wife (Eily Malyon); the nervous Dr. Mortimer (Lionel Atwill) who first comes to warn Holmes of the goings-on but seems shady himself; the loud and suspicious Frankland (Barlowe Borland), and the too-friendly Stapleton (Morton Lowry). All of them seem at least half-convinced that the demonic hound of legend which has preyed on every lord of Baskerville Hall since the 1650s is to blame, but the rational Holmes will have nothing of it - though curiously it's Watson who accompanies the new Lord to the Hall to watch over him, with Holmes staying in London. Or so it seems...

This whips by in 80 minutes and there are definitely scenes that feel too rushed, and a denoument in particular that's a bit sketchy, but Rathbone and Bruce - not yet the bumbling idiot he would become in later films - work hard to keep things real, and the real star of the show here is in the spectacular moor sets by Richard Day and Hans Peters, combining with the photography of J. Peverell Marley to create a truly spooky and eerie backdrop for the action, and one that seems, if not ""real"" then certainly larger and more extensive than it really is. Really a fine example of Hollywood set design at it's best in the golden age. Sidney Lanfield's direction isn't anything spectacular, but he does manage some nice sequences involving the hound of the title, and a feeling of isolation and wildness that's evocative of another time and place - even if it's not, quite, exactly, Dartmoor in the 1880s.

Certainly a fine start to the series; I think I like a couple of the other entries I've seen just as much, but I've got no complaints with this one.  This MPI version is unquestionably the one to get (at least, if you're buying a Region 1 disc), with top-notch quality that trumps the many inferior versions that have shown up over the years.  It's not cheap, but it's worth it.  The extras aren't terribly exciting; David Stuart Davies is a serious Holmes expert and he certainly shows his stuff in the commentary, but he's not that enthralling as a companion for 80 minutes.  Still, he's got some nice insights into the production, including a couple of tidbits about the actor playing the Baskerville of the title, Richard Greene - who got star billing above Rathbone's Holmes!  Well, 60 years later Greene is forgotten, and the hawk-nosed adversary of Errol Flynn and Baker Street detective lives on...",1283644800,,3875,4.730370370370371
1991252,3,B0001DCYBE,"""The Hound of the Baskerville's"" was made in the late 1930's and stars Basil Rathbone as the famous Sherlock Holmes.  The story is interesting and a classic ""who done it"" that ages well, in black and white cinema.

The story is about Sir Henry Baskerville, who returns to his ancestral hall after traveling abroad.  A Dr. Mortimer asks Holmes to protect the life of Sir Henry Baskerville, his best friend's nephew.  It is revealed that Mortimer's friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, recently died and although it was ruled a natural death, Dr. Mortimer knew he was being chased by the legendary Hound of the Baskervilles.  This hound has plagued the Baskerville family for years.

While Holmes attends to other matters in London, his partner,  Watson (Nigel Bruce),  is sent to stay with Sir Henry and keep an account of routine as well as puzzling happenings at the ancestral estate and hall.  He is dedicated to protecting Sir Henry and notes the puzzling actions of servants in the hall.  Odd happening before included a single boot stolen at Sr. Henry's hotel room before arriving at his ancestral home.

Sir Henry is an eligible, handsome bachelor and soon meets the beautiful Beryl Stapleton and her brother John.  Sir Henry and Beryl soon start keeping company and become engaged.  The puzzling plot thickens as Holmes reveals he has been masquerading as a bum who lives in the moors.  He has solved the murder mystery in his mind, and knows Sr. Henry is next.  However, he needs to catch the murderer ""red handed"".  Holmes hatches a smart trap to catch the killer and solve the mysteries of the Baskervilles.

Overall, the movie is an entertaining mystery.",1280707200,,1661,4.854092526690391
1991253,4,B0001DCYBE,"Given that Basil Rathbone is so strongly identified with Sherlock Holmes, it's interesting to note that Rathbone receives second billing to Richard Greene, a man best remembered for the 1950s ""Robin Hood"" series on TV. But in 1939 Greene was an up and coming romantic lead, discovered by Alexander Korda and Darryl Zanuck, and had starred opposite such notables as Shirley Temple in ""The Little Princess"" (1939), Loretta Young in ""Kentucky"" (1938), and Nancy Kelly in ""Submarine Patrol"" (1938). Greene was a low budget version of Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn, and since Rathbone had always played second fiddle (no pun intended for Sherlock fans) to Flynn (""Captain Blood"", ""Robin Hood"") it made sense for him to be listed as the second male star.

Prior to this film, was there ever a greater villain than Basil Rathbone, who gave us such great performances as the abusive Mr. Murdstone in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), the deadly Tybalt in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), evil Sir Guy in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), and Baron von Frankenstein in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939). His list of villainous parts was already established so that even this and the ""Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (1939) didn't stop him from appearing as the evil Captain Esteban in ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940).

Rathbone was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""If I Were King""), but never won. From 1939 to 1946 he focused on Holmes films with only an occasional second film in any given year. He made the transition early to TV where he was a popular guest star, and continued to do films (e.g., ""We're No Angels"", ""The Last Hurrah"").

The film itself came out in 1939 and was within the time of the popularity of the horror film genre that had grown to enormous success in the early 30s with ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""Dracula"" (1931), ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), ""Wax Museum"" (1933), etc. There are significant overlaps between this film and those horror staples, which may be why ""Hound"" was chosen as the first of the Holmes films to produce in the sound era. Indeed, the escaped convict in ""Hound"" looks suspiciously like Bela Lugosi as Ygor in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939).

The great Lionel Atwil appears as a potential suspect. Atwil is best remembered for his iconic role as Inspector Krogh in ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939). Between 1918 and 1946 he made 75 films, mostly horror (e.g., ""The Man Who Reclaimed His Head"",  ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"", ""Murders in the Zoo""). Interestingly enough, he went on to play Holmes' arch enemy, Moriarty, in ""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"" (1943) and for my money, he was the best Moriarty.

Rathbone's good friend Nigel Bruce appeared in all 14 of the Rathbone Holmes films. Bruce had quite a distinguished career apart from the Holmes' film, appearing in many British films like ""Treasure Island"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934), ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). He worked with Hitchcock in ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Suspicion"" (1941).

The film is certainly worth a view.",1280707200,,3056,4.95703125

In those days, the set and artistic directors got credits at the end, but the artists who worked on the sets got no credits. How different it is today, when the credits for every movie include even the outfit that catered the food on the set!

1991255,4,B0001DCYBE,"I'm rewatching all the Rathbone Holmes flicks in order, and this was the first, but not the best. It's a little too plodding at moments, and many of the moors scenes are hokey and studio-bound. I've read every one of the Doyle Holmes tales at least a few times, and while Hound is one of the most popular, I've always thought it was far from the best. Likewise the film.

Don't get me wrong: it's still very entertaining, and Rathbone is already a perfect Holmes right out of the gate. But there's less humor and slyness here than in the later films, and the story's relative obviousness lessens the suspense factor quite a bit.

That said, it's still well worth watching, but mainly for Rathbone. No one else in it really did much for me, and even Bruce's Watson is a little too harmless here compared to later efforts by the classic Basil/Nigel duo. Their chemistry is starting to blossom here, but only in the next episode (The Adventures of SH) does it begin to really flower.

In some ways this is just a rather standard old b&w detective film, leavened only by the masterful turn by Rathbone, who one imagines Doyle would have heartily approved of. Predictable, with a pretty cheesy love interest side plot, Hounds is good, but not great.

The transfer by UCLA is almost flawless; you won't see many films from the 1930s looking this perfect. All the better to watch the intensity in Basil's eyes; every actor should study his total immersion in this character.

Very nice commentary, by a Holmes scholar/fanatic, on the dvd as well.",1273104000,,1539,4.643382352941177

""Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first of the 14 ""Sherlock Holmes"" films made by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, and the first of two set in the original late 19th-century time period of the original stories (films three through fourteen magically move the action to the World World II era, with varying degrees of success).  Fun fact about the story on which this film is based: ""Hound"" was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in response to the public's clamoring for new Sherlock Holmes stories despite the fact that Sir Arthur had killed the character off years before.  Interestingly, ""Hound"" didn't undo the death of Holmes, merely present a ""previously untold"" adventure of Holmes and Watson set sometime before Mr. Holmes demise.

As for the story, despite the famous title - perhaps the most famous of all the Sherlock Holmes stories - I found the movie to be just an average Holmes tale. It was entertaining and well-done but nothing spectacular. I am certain not knocking this film. I love these old Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce movies. An ""average"" Holmes film with these two guys still gets an 4-star rating!

This was the first pairing of the above-mentioned two actors and Bruce, as ""Dr. Watson,"" was not the bumbling, buffoon as he was in subsequent episodes. However, I prefer Watson in that role because he added a lot of humor and entertainment. In this movie, Watson is pictured as fairly intelligent, for a change!

1991260,5,B0001DCYBE,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels had a touch of magic about them.  Very few film versions have managed to capture that magic; this is one of them.

Firstly, Sidney Lanfield's direction is first rate.  It is so sure and fluid that no one thinks to acknowledge it.  The same could be said for both Ernest Pascal's screenplay and Gene Markey and Darryl F. Zanuck's producing.

More obvious are the merits of J. Peverell Marley's cinematography; Richard Day and Hans Peters' Art Direction; and Thomas Little's Set Decoration.  The beautifully gloomy sets; London streets, the moors, the Baskerville Estate, were all well designed and filmed.  And they are positively luminescent in the DVD and Blu-ray formats.  [Note: the Blu-ray, by virtue of its higher resolution, does show more artifacts.  So, image superiority here is almost a matter of personal preference.]
And the actors make the settings worthwhile with great performances by Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson.  The supporting cast is also first rate.  The only sub-par performance was turned in by Wendy Barrie as Beryl Stapleton; a little too mannered and flat.
Highlights include: Lionel Atwill as a cautious Dr. James Mortimer, an almost skeletal John Carradine as Barryman, Morton Lowry as  John Stapleton, and the always watchable E.E. Clive, as the Cabby.

Having seen many different actors portray the legendary Sherlock Holmes, I have always found the combination of Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce portraying Holmes & Watson to be the most legendary.  This version of The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the best the two actors appeared in, along with The Scarlet Claw.

The story, of course, centers around a legendary hound that legend tells has stalked the descendants of Hugo Baskerville since his mutilation death by the beast some centuries in the past.  Holmes & Watson go to work in an attempt to prevent the current heir to the Baskerville estate from meeting the same fate as his ancestor Hugo did.

1991265,5,B0001DCYBE,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is the classic Sherlock Holmes story.

the number one Holmes's story in fact.

and this is the classic version of the story.

there have been many other versions.
but this will allways be the best of the lot.

with the other versions I will say this..
-Hound (Hammer) Peter Cushing.
  Cushing makes a good Holmes. but this has the usual Hammer stupid plot lines. the spider scean for example
-Hound (Brett)
  this seemed a rather tired and dull presentation. Brett himself did not seem very interested in it. he did not have the same fire as when he started out.
-Hound (Roxburough)
  I very much disliked this version. to showy and to much horror. nice images and some good actors, espesily Richard Grant as the villen. but Roxburough is not my idea of what Holmes should be, hes much to gruff.
most slanderous of all is at the end when watson declars that he does not trust Holmes. something the 'real' watson would never say!!
-Hound (Ian Richardson)
 Richardson makes a good Holmes but much of this is again to much horror and has a bit to many rip offs of the Rathbone version.
-Hound (Dudly More)
 Do I even have to say why this one is just plain wrong.

NOW.. moving on to this version, the Rathbone version.

This is the first time Rathbone would take on the mantle of Sherlock Holmes.
he would go on to play the charture for several more movies and many many more radio plays.

he excells in every scean he is in.
Rathbone is a wonderful performer and its hard not to see why he makes a good Holmes.

Nigel Bruce makes his first apperance as Dr Watson.
he also would go on to play the charture for a long time.
and even appear in many radios shows even when he was not working with Rathbone.
sadly Bruce was made to play Watson as a baffoon on many ocasions.
something he personly hated.
Bruce enjoyed playing the charture on radio because as narrator he was a bit more intelligent.
in this movie Bruce is not as silly as he would later apper to be in other movies.
in this mvoie he can be rather competent at times even.

moving on to the story.
yes this is different then the book.
NO movie is exactly like the book.
this version takes many liberties
here Stapleton's 'sister' is his 'half sister'
and there is also the added seiance scean
(something that would appeal to the writer but not to the story)

dispite these twists in storyline
this still remains a classic version.

all the actors are topnotch.

Lionel Atwill plays Dr Mortimer
(He would appear as Moriarty in a later Rathbone movie)
John Carradine, Richard Greene, and Moton Lowry as Stapelton.

all these actors did great jobs.
espesily Lowry as the villen.
he was at time so cheerful that you just knew he was utterly evil.

this movie also has many great images
some inspired by the book.

Watson and Baskerville confront the convict on the moor, Holmes looks at the painting of Baskerville and we see a close up of the eyes of the painting, the victorian london sceans are well done, as are the mysterious atmosphere of the Grimpan moor.

there are the great sceans..
Holmes as the old begger
(notice how watson pics up that he limps with a different foot)
watson confronts the 'begger' who reveals himself.
holmes finds the lair of the Hound and is locked in.
Stapelton releases the Hound.
the hound chases Baskerville
and many others.

even though this is not excactly like the book it is a great movie version.
far superior over any other version.
everything about it is wonderful to watch.

again it has great actors, sceans, and a great story to boot.

its also interesting to note that this is the first, and only time, that a sherlock Holmes Rathbone movie mentions Holmes's cocain adiction
espeisly at the end when he asks for 'the needle'.

1991284,3,B0001DCYBE,"To select just one representative Sherlock Holmes film from the hundred or so made since Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a virtual impossibility, especially as no one actor (including such famous talents as John Barrymore, Clive Brook and Raymond Massey) has yet managed to successfully transfer the true Holmesian character to the screen... But if one has to be singled out probably the best choice would be the 1939 version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" the most famous of all Conan Doyle's long novels and the film that introduced Basil Rathbone in the part of Sherlock Holmes...

Although no less a critic than Graham Greene found Rathbone unacceptable, complaining of his good humor and general air of refreshing health, the tall, thin British born actor is still the man most people associate with the role... He played in 14 Holmes movies between 1939 and 1946, two ""A"" productions and twelve double features...

Set in the correct period, ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" follows Conan Doyle closely including only one scene, a sance, not in the original story... Its opening sequence on a deserted moor with a man running in terror from the unseen beast and its climax with Holmes going out alone into the foggy night to track down the ""Hell Hound"" really catches the suspense and mystery of Conan Doyle's story...

The film is most impressive when it convincingly sketches in the streets and fashions of Edwardian London, a remarkable achievement when one considers that recreation of London and English settings has not been one of Hollywood's strongest points over the years...

The final curtain line makes it difficult to believe that the film was made in 1939 with all the restrictions and censorship of that period... References to Holmes' drug taking have rarely if ever been made in Holmes movies but in ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" the great detective stalks out of the room calling to his ever faithful companion, ""The needle, Watson, the needle.""",1167609600,7,1970,4.996951219512195

I enjoyed this until I managed to catch Edward Hardwickes portrayal of the same role in ""The Hound"" from the Granada series.

 I own both versions, and love the black and white conception: but the portrayals of Mr. Brett, and Mr. Hardwicke far out distance the earlier ones; and it is their version which I would recommend.

I am not a fan of Nigel Bruce's bumbling Dr. Watson, who seemed to have the mental capacity of a preschooler. How a man like his Dr. Watson could ever become a doctor is unfathomable. The Sherlock Holmes movies starring the great Basil Rathbone, were never faithful to the Conan Doyle stories, or books. This one comes very close. Nigel Bruce was a great actor in every other film he was in.  It is a mystery as to why he was cast as a doddering, bumbling old duffer in these movies. The best representations of Watson can be found in David Burke, and Edward Hardwicke.  For me, the biggest mistake that producers of the Rathbone movies made was in changing the stories to the (then) modern times.  Hound of the Baskervilles is the only Rathbone version of Sherlock Holmes cast in the proper period.  This movie is excellent, has great atmosphere, and solid performances.  Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson had not yet been cast as a doddering old fool in this film, and he turns in a fine performance.  In Hound, he is a more solid, dependable help to Sherlock Holmes. The other Sherlock Holmes movies starring Rathbone & Bruce are fine if viewed simply as mysteries on the level of ""Murder She Wrote"".  But, if you are looking for good Sherlock Holmes movies after this one, then Jeremy Brett is the next choice for great characterization and a closer adherence to the stories and the books.",1140825600,4,1470,4.545454545454546

This is the wonderful version of this story with Rathbone and Bruce, truly a must see.

1991307,5,B0001DCYBE,"I have always had a bit of difficulty with the Rathbone / Bruce Holmes series, featuring Sherlock Holmes removed from his Victorian setting and pitting his powers against Nazi spies and serial villains like The Scarlet Claw.  They seemed a bit...undignified and silly.  But fortunately, in this first Holmes film, they did honorable duty to Conan Doyle's famous story.

""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is probably the most well-known of all the Doyle Holmes stories, and certainly the most-adapted with around 17 filmed versions over the years.  This is an almost-straight adaptation, following the story with only minor changes.  The most notable change is the removal of the supernatural elements regarding the Hound, who is little more than a large, fierce dog.  It is the only one of the Rathbone/Holmes series to acknowledge Holmes' cocaine habit, which was quite controversial and removed from all other films.

Rathbone is a commanding Holmes, and it is a joy to see his stunning performance.  His appearance, his voice...everything is perfect.  This is definitely an actor born to his role.  The costume designers allowed Holmes to be authentic in costume design, wearing Top Hat and suit while walking around London, rather than being permanently affixed to his Deer Stalker and Cloak.

Bruce is a much more troubling Watson, although those raised on the movies instead of the books seem to take him without pause.  Fortunately, in this first film Bruce's Watson was not the bumbling  buffoon that he would become in the later Holmes films.  He is still allowed some dignity, although he is not the able doctor and companion of the books.

The DVD is nice, crisp and clear.  The commentary track is a bit dry, but David Stuart Davies is a font of knowledge both on the original stories as well as the Rathbone/Bruce Hollywood adaptations.  He has background on the actors, and the choices that were made in adapting the stories to the silver screen.  The other extras are trailers for a few of the other Rathbone/Bruce Holmes films, none of which mach the quality of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles.""

All in all ""The Hound of the Baskervilles""  is a great Holmes film, a good DVD,  and a lovely adaptation of a great story.  Atmospheric, well-acted and respectfully adapted, it can be enjoyed by any Holmes fan.",1126224000,5,2320,4.940568475452197

1991320,5,B0001DCYBE,"It's perhaps surprising that ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" has become the single most well-known Sherlock Holmes story. True, like many of the short stories, it takes Holmes and Watson away from their digs in London and out to an ancient familial estate. But it has two elements that make it distinct from nearly every other of the original stories: it has a distinct supernatural element, and Holmes himself is absent for a sizeable portion of the narrative. No doubt Fox chose to adapt this story for its popularity as much as anything else, but the supernatural element was certainly a factor in its favor. One of the great selling points of the film is its recreation of the ghostly moors, even with studio sets. And it's only natural that Fox wanted to cover up Holmes' absence as much as possible, by creating what really hadn't been seen before on film: a convincing and engaging Holmes/Watson dichotomy.

Rathbone and Bruce make this film. Whether you like or dislike their individual interpretations, you've got to admit they work well together. And it's a testament to Nigel Bruce's ability as an actor, bumbler or no, that he can carry the film for those twenty or thirty minutes when Sherlock Holmes is completely absent. Richard Greene gets top billing, sure, but this is the first time a Holmes and Watson team completely outshine everything else in the production.

Some reviews take great pains to point out what Fox changed about this story. But in reality, this is probably the most straightforward ""Hound"" ever made. Most of the changes are made for simple brevity, stripping away the subplots and leaving the core. This is probably to keep the film both within budget, and from shifting too far from the Holmes/Watson focus; in other adaptations, Holmes might be off the screen for up to an hour. A couple changes are obviously made to please the studio (changing Barrymore to Barryman, so as not to insult the famous acting family) or the morals of the day (the complications concerning Stapleton's sister have been removed), but the only one that's really strange is the decision not to make the hound itself glow! It reduces the effectiveness of the climax, particularly after all the supernatural lead-up, and it's the one flaw I can really find with the film.

MPI presents this film in a very nice package that compliments its earlier ""Sherlock Holmes Collection"" releases of the later Universal films. Although the film, unlike the later ones, hasn't been restored by the UCLA, you'll hardly notice it; there's a few spots on certain scenes late in the action, but they are very fleeting indeed. This is a lovely, clean picture, very sharp, with great greys and blacks. Similarly, the mono audio is crisp and clear. You won't be unhappy.

The extras are a little more of a mixed bag. Richard Valley's booklet of production notes (should you purchase the disc) are, as usual, very insightful and well worth your time. Unfortunately, David Stuart Davies' commentary is rather dry and simplistic. If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, you probably already know most of the information he relates, and may want skip it. Casual viewers, however, might find interest in skimming it with the chapter search buttons. A photo gallery is included, although it's constantly animated with zooms and pans (something which personally bothers me), and three trailers are included in a 'trailer gallery.' None of them, however, are for ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" They are all re-release trailers, in pretty poor condition, for later films in the Universal series: ""Dressed to Kill"" (film #14), ""House of Fear"" (film #10), and ""Terror by Night"" (film #13). Why these particular trailers were chosen, I'm not sure.

If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, you'll not only want to see this film, you'll want to own it; at the $15-$20 price point, it's well worth it. This is the essential version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" and even more so, the quintessential Sherlock Holmes film. Highly recommended.",1108425600,43,4014,4.931952662721893

(Note: this review is for the DVD ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" released by ""Mpi Media Group"" in 2004.)

I watched this movie without reading the 1902 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novel of the same name that it was based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

This was the first movie that had Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson.  They would go on together to make thirteen more popular Sherlock Holmes movie mysteries.  It's difficult to believe, but in this movie they were not given top
billing!

The movie begins with printed text:

""1889: In all England there is no district more dismal than the vast expanse of primitive wasteland, the moors of Dartmoore in Devonshire.""

Then we are shown a death of a man.  The deceased turns out to be Sir Charles Baskerville of the estate called ""Baskerville Hall.""  Was his death of natural causes or was it a murder?

Because of his death, the estate now falls to Sir Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene).  He soon receives an anonymous note that reads:

""As you value your life or your reason, keep away from the moor.""

At this point, Sherlock Holmes is called in to investigate.  He learns of the Baskervilles and the ""curse of the hound"" that has been bestowed on this family for the last two hundred years.  Holmes dismisses the idea of a killer hound as a myth but decides to further investigate so as to get to the real truth.  Dr. Watson aids him in his investigation.

Be sure to listen for the last line spoken by Holmes in this movie.  It alludes to the cocaine habit that Sherlock Holmes had acquired.  (Holmes' cocaine habit is a feature of Conan Doyle's novel.)

Rathbone catches the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Bruce also gives an excellent performance.  You will notice that Dr. Watson has an expanded role in this movie.  All supporting actors do a good job in their roles.

The eerie atmosphere of this movie is superb.  The background music adds to each scene.

Finally DVD extras include an interesting audio commentary, selected theatrical trailers, production notes, and photo gallery.

In conclusion, this is an exciting, suspenseful movie that is worthwhile watching even if you have read the novel it is based on!!

1991322,5,B0001DCYBE,"This is the excellent beginning to the legendary film series (14 in all) starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as the original dynamic duo of sleuths.

Based upon the classic story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and well adapted to the silver screen), Rathbone's commanding presence as Holmes is even more impressive by the fact that he only appears occasionally throughout the film.  Instead, Nigel Bruce as Watson does most of the detective legwork on screen covering for Holmes' absence from Baskerville Hall until the great sleuth is finally able to join him to hunt down the dreaded monster dog (and its sinister master) awaiting in the moors for its next victim.

We lived in Los Angeles, and local channel 9 would run the SAME movie, Monday through Friday, for one week at 7:00 or 8:00 on its ""Million Dollar Movie"" program (a ridiculous title nowadays). Anyway, I watched it all five times in one week and adored it. I didn't see it again until its special, limited re-release to theaters in 1975; by then, I was a dyed-in-the-wool Sherlockian. Remarkably, my 10-year-old mind hadn't exaggerated the greatness of Rathbone or this film. It remained marvelous!
Now it's available on DVD...and what a wonderful transfer. And the commentary is superb. I haven't yet watched it five nights in a row, but it certainly deserves that kind of attention. Highly recommended!",1089849600,11,762,4.7368421052631575
1991324,4,B0001DCYBE,"Many actors have tried, but none has surpassed Basil Rathbone's embodiment of Sherlock Holmes. The razor-sharp profile, hawk nose and cocaine eyes seem torn straight from the pages of Arthur Conan Doyle. This is, undeniably, one of the great pairings of actor and character in film history.
Odd to think, then, that the first Holmes film with Rathbone and his faithful Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, gave neither man starring credit. That honor on ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" went to the romantic leading man, Richard Greene.
The lapse in logic was quickly corrected, with Rathbone and Bruce going on to top-bill 13 famed Holmes movies from 1939-46.
The UCLA Film and TV Archive has rescued the films from public domain hell, in a restoration that aims to return them to 35mm theatrical condition using original elements and acetate copies. The results as seen on MPI's DVDs are indeed impressive, with shadows and light elegant and edgy. Wear is within reason, and the audio suffices.
Film historians' commentaries have been added to some of the feature films, explaining, for instance, just how the 19th century detectives ended up battling Nazis in WWII.
The MPI collection -- whose titles are available separately and in sets -- started rolling out in the fall. The series concludes at the beginning, with ""Baskervilles"" and ""Adventures,"" both made by Fox before Universal took over and ""modernized"" the Doyle stories. The Uni films have their moments -- ""Woman in Green,"" for example, is grand and grisly entertainment -- but there's no topping these initial releases, set in Victorian times.
""Baskervilles"" remains one of the most famous and fondly remembered Holmes films, but it is largely Dr. Watson's tale. Nigel Bruce's Watson quickly became a buffoon in the series, but here he is not to be trifled with. (Rathbone later defended his friend and co-star against critics, saying a ""less lovable"" actor would have ruined the series.)
The restoration puts Fox's amazing sets on full display, including the fog-engulfed moor where the hound fillets his victims. The commentator, chipper British author David Stuart Davies, churns out minutiae and unmasks plot inconsistencies.",1086739200,16,2181,5.181303116147308

If you have kids in the 7-15 year old range, watching old movies like this is a great alternative to most of the garbage put out today.  Basil Rathborne is wonderful in the lead role, and this is one of the finer screen adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous literary character.

No contemporary film comes close to the suspense you will encounter in this Darryl Zanuck production.  Life-long friends Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes) and Nigel Bruce (Dr. Watson) play off each other to perfection in ""Hound.""  What is amazing is that, in actuality, Bruce was three years younger than Rathbone!
There are myriad twists and turns in this thrilling tale.  From the opening scene of Sir Charles Baskerville's death to the moment when Holmes reveals the name of Sir Charles' murderer, this classic film will not disappoint.
A stellar supporting cast, lead by horror villains Lionel Atwill (Dr. Mortimer) and John Carradine (Barryman), delights for the entire 80-minutes.  In fact, Atwill's Dr. Mortimer is so innately menacing, that it is almost a disappointment that he is not found to be Sir Charles' murderer at film's end.  Alas, Holmes' fans are well aware that Atwill returns in the 1942 Universal film, ""The Secret Weapon,"" as Professor Moriarty.  As a side note, Atwill was blacklisted by the major studios (Fox, Warners, MGM, and Paramount) after it was made public that he conducted an ""orgy"" at his Brentwood estate in 1941; thus only the studio known for horror films, Universal, would give him work in the 40s -- a waste of tremendous talent.

1991327,4,B0001DCYBE,"You will read dozens of reviews of the movie, I'm sure, so I'll leave my review of the movie to two words: ""LOVED IT.""
DVD quality is really quite good; of course, leaps and bounds beyond ANYTHING available to the home market EVER before.  Nice, clean packaging with a thin-looking but richly written booklet included inside.  The disc has the photo from the front imprinted, with almost a purple tint...  for nighttime I suppose.
As I understand, this restoration was done a number of years ago, and was not digital...  I believe it, although I will say I believe the restorers squeezed every square inch of detail out of their source material possible in the analog domain.
First, the flaws: there are still occasional nicks and scratches, although not many more than I see in my DVD of ""It's A Wonderful Life.""
The sound has some low-level hiss, and there is occasional pop and crackle, only occasionally (once?  Twice?)  of any significant volume.
About 18 minutes in there appears to be some minor damage, possibly the degrading of the nitrate print they were working from?
Additionally, there are about three places in the film where a single frame appears to be warped, creating a ""blip"" in the flow of the motion on the screen.
Also odd was my first playing: when it came to the end of the 9th chapter, instead of going on to the 10th it jumped back to the beginning of the 9th!  This might have been my player, as I was unable to reproduce this either by scanning back or by playing through the movie from the beginning.
One other oddity is that in multiple places the background seems to ""pulse,"" usually getting slightly darker, and it appears to be two ""pulses"" per second.  Perhaps the processor was averaging contrasts, or perhaps it was the DVD compression, slowly filling in the right computations...  I am not sure, I have never seen it before, and it seemed to not at ALL affect the main action / elements on the screen.  I also was not aware of it when the camera was in motion, only when we were stationary observing somebody or something.
A minor annoyance was the darkness of the train before we go ""inside"" to see Holmes & Watson...  I'm guessing this was stock footage, a condition of the original print and not something from a historical standpoint that you would WANT to correct..  But the train looks like it's going at night yet the window in Holmes & Watson's car shows a midday countryside passing by.  Just odd.
Now, the plusses: this print is beautiful!  The detail makes it look like a high-quality print from the 50s or 60s, from Holmes' clothes to the lace on the headrest of the train seats.  This is not an easy film to reproduce, with filming having started at the end of '38.  The blackest blacks to the whitest whites are there, almost always perfectly balanced.  Some shots with the right combination of light and shadow truly are breathtaking.  So much fog, combined with pipe smoke and low lighting...  an ultimate stress test for DVD compression to reproduce, yet it looks very good here.  I cannot imagine you have EVER seen this film look this good, seriously.
The soundtrack, despite its minor low-level noise, is amazing for the time, with the noise present being so low, apparently without any artificial-sounding noise gates or expanders.  Crank up the volume in quiet scenes and you will hear the papers being rustled, or the crickets in the distance, of the rustling of clothes.  30s soundtracks often sound HORRIBLE on music, and while the opening 20th Century Fox fanfare sounds like a copy of a copy, the music in the body of the movie itself appears to be clean and undistorted.  I noticed it most on the closing credits, which genuinely surprised me with its lack of harshness or square waves.  The ending music is downright enjoyable to listen to!
The dialog is both crisp, clear, and with respectable lower tones.  You are not going to get earth shattering bass here, but if you are expecting typical thin 30s audio, you are in for a pleasant surprise.  Every word is perfectly audible and in balance...  I did not feel like I had to turn the volume up and down, nor did it sound ""squashed.""  No ""pull-up"" of the noise floor, either, indicating no automatic gain controls!  VERY nice.
For you audio nuts, I didn't put a spectrum analyzer on it, but to my ears, I was hearing undistorted highs over 5KHz, likely over 6K, maybe over 7, and it MIGHT be making it to 8K.  I think it's gone by 10K, but STILL...  I was amazed to hear the high frequency harmonics on paper rustling, metallic objects rattling together... and crisp ""ch""s and ""Th""s and the like!
One more comment, on the audio commentary: outstanding.  Really, really good and absolutely worth the time to listen to and watch.  A good balance of history, biography, and literary info.  Hats off to Mr. Davies!  You did a great job.
IN CLOSING: if you have ever wanted to own this movie, even if you already own another copy of it, BUY THIS ONE (from MPI Home Video).  I cannot imagine you being disappointed.
For me, this is my first purchase...  if the first movie from 1939 looks and sounds this good without the advantages of digital restoration...  what do the others look like!  Wow, I can't wait to order them!!!  :)",1083628800,15,5241,4.623783783783784

8010599,4,B0001DCYBE,"It is 1889, and Holmes and Watson receive a visit from the retired Dr. Mortimer. He has retired to the stark beauty of Dartmoor in western England. His good friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, just died of heart failure in the yew alley next to his manor house. Not just died, but left this mortal coil with his face contorted in horror. Sir Charles' heir, young Henry Baskerville, is emigrating from Canada to live at at the Hall and Sir Mortimer is afraid for the new heir's safety: ""I have information that leads me to believe that for centuries past that every Baskerville who has inherited the estates has met with a sudden violent death.""

And the rest, as they say, is history, for ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is surely one of the most famous stories in history.

This is the 1st movie where Basil Rathbone played Sherlock Holmes, with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. Though I enjoy it, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it unnecessarily deletes an area of dramatic tension in the original story and in other filmed versions of the story. I refer to having the Stapletons REALLY be brother & sister, instead of being married and PRETENDING to be siblings. I imagine that's because the sister is a potential romantic interest for young Henry. After all, Richard Greene, the actor who plays Henry, is the actor who got star billing in the movie!

""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" came out in 1939 and is 80 minutes long. If you buy it on disc, English subtitles are available on the movie. The subtitles are a little off once in a while. I actually laughed at one mistake, as it showed that the person making the subtitles had never read the story: Grimpen Mire is shown as ""gimping mire""! Then there's Dr. Mortimer to Holmes and Watson: ""I'm in mortal fear Sir Henry's life will be stuffed out.""

The disc also has three Bonus Features:  A Photo Gallery, Trailers, and a Commentary Track. The Commentary Track is by David Stuart Davies, writer and editor of ""Sherlock "" magazine. I am a fan of commentaries and this one is interesting. At one point, he says, ""It is fair to say that [Nigel] Bruce's [befuddled] Watson is far removed from the character conceived by Arthur Conan Doyle. But Watson has always caused a problem for scriptwriters, because he's an observer and a describer.""

""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is included in a collection of all 14 of the Sherlock films which Rathbone made with Bruce,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Sherlock-Holmes-Collection/dp/B000EXZFRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection</a>.  The first two of the movies were placed in Holmes' ""real"" Victorian times. The last 12 were modernized to take place in the 1940s.

I am a fan of many film and TV iterations of Sherlock Holmes, and that includes the Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock series.

8010602,5,B0001DCYBE,"Nothing is detracted from the talents of Jeremy Brett or Peter Cushing to say that this ""Hound,"" the first to pair Rathbone and Bruce as Homes and Watson, is a classic, well-nigh cinematically canonical, version of Doyle's finest, best-known novel. The production values are far richer than most of the later Rathbone/Holmes pictures; the mood and mores of late 1930s cinema more nearly overlap later twentieth-century adaptations the Victorian era in which the story originated. Finally, this began a marvelously successful, cinematic detective franchise that was probably unequalled until a chap named Bond appeared n Jamaica in 1962.",1508025600,,636,5.5
8010603,5,B0001DCYBE,"Sir Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene whom received top billing) comes from Canady to take possession of hiss ancestral home, he is informed that his uncle was dispatched by a hound from hell. He may be next to become dog chow.

His friend James Mortimer M.D. (an evil looking Lionel Atwill) attempts to engage Sherlock Holmes to investigate and protect Sir Henry. Holmes has other matters to take care of and sends Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) in his place. The adventure begins for Sir Henry Baskerville and for us.

There are several screen play versions of this movie based on a novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Each has its strengths and personal preferences. This is not my personal favorite; however, it is a must see as a classic and the unique actors.

You cannot pass up the voice over commentary as it explains what we see and what we do not see in the production.",1506124800,,871,4.606451612903226
8010604,5,B0001DCYBE,"Everything went right with this version of the famous Sherlock Holmes story. The stars as well as the other performers fit their roles perfectly, the atmosphere was convincing, the story was well-paced, and there was humor, but not overdone. The mystery in the story was not too difficult to figure out, but there were still some unexpected twists.

The story itself: the wealthy lord of a country estate dies, evidently of heart failure, some sort of wild man finds him but is scared off, and the man's nephew comes from Canada to claim the title and property. Trouble is, there is the story of how heirs to the estate have all died violently, so as a safety measure, Sherlock Holmes and Watson are brought in by an old friend of the family.

The movie isn't perfect; the romance subplot seems rather contrived and there are characters who have nothing to do with the actual storyline. But overall the movie is both scary and entertaining.",1497744000,,940,4.725609756097561
