8086681,5,B000BH2WGC,"I loved this DVD! All of the performances were awesome with exception of One-Way performing Cutie Pie. I like the song,but didn't care for their never ending performance of their one song set. They really didn't fit with the vibe of the other AMAZING performances!! The Manhattans brought the house down! Sly,Slick.& Wicked ,I bow down. Denise Williams performance left us speechless,and Bloodstone had us mesmerized. Great DVD",1520208000,,427,5.294117647058823
8086682,2,B000BH2WGC,"Being a soul music lover and expert, this dvd set was mediocre for some of the performances are not in sync!  Purchase a better dvd set called The Big Show hosted by Jerry Butler and I guarantee you the item would be money well spent!",1500508800,,234,4.2

8086689,4,B000BH2WGC,"I bought this concert dvd because it listed the Manhattens in the performance lineup.  I have been looking for a Manhattens concert dvd.  So, I bought this one hoping it would be good.  Wow!  was it ever!  The Manhattens were wonderful!!!!!!  The rest of the performances are great too.  I gave this dvd set a 4.7 overall.  Heres why:  The sound and video quality is superb!  The camera captures all the energy of the perfomrances and the audiance.  The performances are electrifying, and take you back to the time when all these groups were hot.  This is a 2-dvd set.  The second dvd starts off with the Manhattens followed by Sly Slick and Wicked, then One Way, The Delfonics, then Mad Lads.  The second dvd is my favorite because it really flows.  The energy is high, the music is soul stirring.  The Funk of One Way's ""cutie Pie"" will make you dance.  These guys sound as good as they did back in the day.  The first dvd has Bloodstone, Babara Lewis, Gene Chandler, and Deniece Willams.  Thay were still at the top of their game too.  I've bought a number of concert dvds, and this one is truly one of the best!  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but the Manhattens only do 2 songs - (which they did extremely well!)  Still it is one of the most well put together concerts of its kind.  I highly reccomend it.",1290124800,27,1318,4.355371900826446
8086690,4,B000BH2WGC,The dvd does not play completely through. It stops at the second artist. Other then that I guess it's GOOD!!!,1288051200,5,109,4.5
