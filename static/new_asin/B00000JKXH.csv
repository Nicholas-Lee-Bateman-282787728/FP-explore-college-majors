Excellent service. Thank you!",1462579200,,68,6.666666666666667
7912302,4,B00000JKXH,"This is a short (about 55 mins) but interesting video about Olgivanna Wright and her role in her husband's life and architecture.  What I liked best about it were the appearances by people whose names I had read many times, but had never seen them or heard them speak, such as Wright's grandson Brandoch Peters, daughter Iovanna, and apprentice Charles Montooth, to name just a few.  If you're a Wright fan, and you still have a VHS player, this tape is well worth watching.",1340150400,,474,4.630952380952381
