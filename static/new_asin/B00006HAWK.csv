7968629,5,B00006HAWK,We love Arthur. Marc Brown never ceases to amaze me and my family with his choice of topics for Arthur's adventures. Such well written stories with good morals. Kids's of all ages seem to relate to the stories. We have been reading them since my daughter was 2 1/2. The DVDs are a touch different then the books which makes them both entertaining choices.,1361577600,,355,4.5625
