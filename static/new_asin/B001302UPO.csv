1. AJ Styles and Tomko vs. BG James and Bullet Bob Armstrong for the TNA World Tag Team Titles- Now I know this match was made as a tribute to the people across seas and people wanted to pull for BG and bullet bob but I could just not get into this. I think tomko and aj did the best job they could with this match the other team is just to old and slow and can't keep up. This is a match that's worth a look to start but after that nothing more. Winners and still TNA World Tag Team champs Aj Styles and Tomko. Match Rating 3/10.
2. Traci Brooks vs. Payton Banks- This match could have been a lot worse let me tell ya but for the time they were given they did a good job. Mrs. Brooks is actually starting to wrestle more often and is developing very well into a singles wrestler. Not much to say about this match but its worth a look. Winner Traci Brooks. Match Rating 5.5/10.
3. Scott Stiner vs. Petey Williams- I really liked this feud going into this match. It was all about how petey thought he was stronger and a better wrestler than Scott and was out to prove it. The mix of power and speed worked to there favor in this match. Stiner did not look old and he looked motivated and showed it here. Lots of suplexs and some near falls to go with this match. Winner Scott Stiner. Match Rating 7/10.
4. Eric Young vs. James Storm- This feud has been going on for a while now and its been ok. Eric young never puts on 5 star matches but he does enough in the midcard to entertain the normal fan. Solid wrestling here but they were but way short on time, which was a shame. A surprise return by rhinos he gored storm and young pinned him. Winner Eric Young. Match Rating 6.5/10.
5. Awesome Kong vs. ODB For the TNA Women's Title- This was a fresh feud because the gail kong feud had been going on for a while ODB was a solid second choice but I think she still needs to improve here in ring skills. Kong dominated most of the match but it still had a good feel and pace to it. Winner and still TNA Women's Champ Awesome Kong. Match Rating 6.5/10.
6. Abyss vs. Judas Masis in a Barb Wire Massacre- If you're a fan of tna you either liked this match or u didn't I personally liked this cause of how much pain these guys were willing to go through to put there lives on the line. It was like the first barbwire massacre with sabu years ago but not many people have seen that so this was refreshing for most people. Good hardcore bloody action and it was a lot better to have abyss in this type of match as he thrives off these matches. Winner Abyss. Match Rating 8/10.
7. Booker T vs. Robert Roode- Well this feud had been going on for a while and I was not to excited going into this match. Roode is a solid wrestler and so is booker but there only so much you can do with one feud. As for the match it was going fine until the double count out complete BS and it ruined this match. Winner Double Count Out. Match Rating 6/10.
8. Jay Lethal and The Motor City Machine Guns vs. Team 3D and Brother Devine in a hardcore street fight for the X Division Title- These stipulations to this match were interesting as if Team 3D lost they had to get under 270 pounds. Kind of a dumb story line but it worked. This was great hardcore action all they way around and kind of like Abyss match Team 3D works better in these type of matches this far into their career. Solid hardcore action. Winners and new X Division Champ Jay Lethal. Match Rating 8/10.
9. Kurt Angle vs. Christian Cage for the TNA World Heavyweight Title- These two have had so many matches together but they never fail to disappoint. They always bring there a game and that's what they did tonight. Angle and cage just had a solid wrestling match wit little interference till the end and no hardcore action just good old school technical wrestling. Some may get annoyed because they have faced each other so much but I promise you will like this match when you watch it. Winner and Still TNA World Heavyweight Champ Kurt Angle. Match Rating 10/10.
Well that raps up another. I would give TNA AGAINST ALL ODDS 2008 a grade of 60.5/90 which means this is a good ppv. I would say that's accurate. There are not really any match of the year matches except angle vs. cage and a lot of average matches. Still worth the 15 dollars I spent and I would recommend it to u. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1215302400,2,4482,4.217694994179278
8248688,4,B001302UPO,"TNA Against All Odds 2008 became a very good ppv, especially after a slow start. The ppv was live in two separate locations due to South Carlolina's athletic association not letting Barb Wire Massacre II to take place in their state so further more, the match was held in Orlando.

Before the event started, TNA played the National Anthem, which was a classy move on their part.

1. TNA Tag Team Championship
AJ Styles & Tomko vs. BG James & ""Bullet"" Bob Armstrong
To say the least, this wasn't a bad match. It was pretty average even with a 67 year old veteran taking part in it. decent opener but it served its purpose for what was going to happen later on in the world title match. 2.5/5

2. Traci Brooks vs. Payton Banks
This match was only here to keep on the rivalry between Mrs. Brooks and Robery Roode. It got a little physical on the utside but nothing special besides that. 2/5

3. Case vs. Case Match
""Maple Leaf Muscle"" Petey Williams vs. ""Big Poppa Pump"" Scott Steiner
This was a really good match. it got funny at times when Petey taunted Steiner by doing Steiner's poses and all. Some nice suplexes and wrestling. Petey was trying to pull off the canadian destroyer before Steiner's mystery woman interferred which costed Petey the match but it turned out to be a good match. 3.5/5

4. Drinking Championship Series Belt Match
Eric Young vs. ""Cowboy"" James Storm
A great match for this ""non-TNA"" title. some good brawling and good outside action where Young and Storm took some vicious slams on the exposed concrete floor. there is even some high risk from Young. very good match. 4/5

5. TNA Knockout Championship
Awesome Kong vs. The O.D.B.
Good women's match. The TNA women matches are really becoming supreme matches; much better than WWE's. This was a fun match to watch which even got a little personal too, with the action getting physical on the outside. pretty good women's match. 3/5

6. Barbed Wire Massacre II
""The Monster"" Abyss vs. Judas Mesias w/ James Mitchell
*Warning*- This match was everything it was advertised to be, just violent and bloody. It wasn't as violent as the Sabu/Abyss barb wire massacre match, but it was still very violent in its own right. If you're not a fan of hardcore wrestling, I would still check this match out just to see how it occurs. Just very gory and violent. 4/5

7. Grudge Match
Robert Roode vs. Booker T
I believed that this rivalry really dragged on way too long but this match really became worth watching. Good wrestling and good brawling. 3.5/5

8. Hardcore Street Fight for the X-Division Championship
Jay Lethal & Motor City Machineguns vs. Team 3D & Johnny Devine
Buh Buh really knows how to talk the talk don't he and he shows it in his interview before the match. The match was more of a street fight then ""hardcore"". Trash cans, road signs, computer key board, a table, kitchen sink, and even a blow up doll all comes into play. classic team 3d hardcore match. lethal hits the elbow on devine through the table for the win and regains the x-division title for the x-division. Great match. 5/5

9. TNA World Championship
Kurt Angle vs. Christian Cage with Samoa Joe as the Special Enforcer
Good build up to the match. This match gave you that true main event feeling that displays what a main event should be like. great mat wrestling from both men. Tomko comes out and screws Christian. An awesome main event. 5/5

Against All Odds was a pheonomenal event, i highly recommend on purchasing it. Great PPV!!!!!",1213056000,,3485,4.622977346278317
8248689,4,B001302UPO,"Tag Team Champions AJ Styles & Tomko vs. B.G. James & Bob Armstrong - Before I get started, that was a classy thing they did with the Marines & the Armstrongs in the same state they both enlisted in the military.  This was a decent match that the crowd seemed to enjoy so it did it's job as the opening match.

Traci Brooks vs. Payton Banks - With Payton having dark hair now, she looks similar to Tina Fey.  Anyways, this was a good womens match here that went back & forth in the ring and some brawling outside as well.

Petey Williams vs. Scott Steiner - The winner of this match gets both the World Title & X Division Title shot cases.  The match to me was entertaining as ""Maple Leaf Muscle"" would mock Steiner's poses & even use his moves (Steiner Recliner) against him thoughout the match.  The match ended with a large muscular woman appeared to distract Petey for Scott to get the win.

Eric Young vs. James Storm - Well, this was for the prestigous ""World Beer Drinking Championship""...or at least you would get that impression from the pre-match video.  This was a good match that really hooked the crowd.  They worked on the outside hiptossing & suplexing each other on the concrete and on the inside with Young even stealing a page out of Ric Flair's playbook with the ""flip over the turnbuckle"" spot.  One funny spot to look out for at the end was when Young picked up Jackie & used her as a battering ram right into Storm's crotch before getting both into a death valley driver.  Rhino returned in the end helping Young get the victory & retaining the drinking championship...which is nothing more than a toy John Cena spinning championship belt with a beer bottle over the ""WWE"" logo.

Womens Champion Awesome Kong vs. O.D.B. - For a majority of the match, Kong dominated & shoved off O.D.B.'s offense for most of the match with her only getting in some dropkicks, a Thesz press, and a slam out of the corner turnbuckle after many unsuccessful attempts thoughout the match.  This match wasn't on the level of the Kim/Kong series but was still a nice match to watch.

Barbed Wire Massacre 2: Abyss vs. Judas Mesias - Just a couple of notes before the match, this happened ""live (on tape)"" from the Impact Zone due to problems with the state athletic commission.  And secondly, despite what Mike Tenay said at the start of the match...Abyss lost the first Barbed Wire Massacre match (Turning Point 2005) against Sabu, not the other way around.
The match is exactly what it was advertised to me, bloody & brutal as both men hit the wire various times cutting Abyss' arm & Judas' chest in the beginning.  Other weapsons like barbed wire wrapped chairs & boards were used to at various times like Abyss getting chairshots to the head, getting crotched on the chair after trying to hit a running splash, Judas being dropped onto one board & put through another, Abyss being speared into a board before being black hole slamming Judas for the win.  A violent brawl & the best Abyss PPV match I've seen in months.

Booker T vs. Robert Roode - This was advertised as grudge match and the match played out exactly like that. Booker came out aggressive & dominating right from the start until Payton Banks distracted Booker for Roode to finally gain some offense in but Booker wouldn't back down. Roode ran away to the back, Booker followed & brawled backstage until Roode finally was able to get in a car (throwing Payton Banks in Booker's way) to drive away.  Again, this was to put over & continue the storyline between the two.  The match itself was solid as well.

Street Fight Match: Jay Lethal & Motor City Machine Guns vs. Team 3D & Johnny Devine - The X division (and apparently, the title as well) is on the line here.  This match was all about putting over Jay Lethal heavily even down to Team 3D showing Lethal respect in the pre-match interview.  Being this was a street fight, you got exactly what you would expect...a brawl even down to the kitchen sink, trash cans, chairs, a blowup doll that we haven't seen since the Jackass 2 storyline, and the old ECW ""Use My Sign"" spot all coming into effect at various times.  The Machine Guns were knocked out with the 3D during the match so it was Lethal fighting against all odds against 3D & Devine.  So Cal Val (the redheaded girl at ringside) got involved played the ""Ms. Elizabeth"" role by being the lady in trouble by Brother Ray before Lethal made the save for her.  Lethal got the victory & the championship back with a flyin' elbow though a table on Devine.  A fun match to watch from beginning to end.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Christian Cage with Samoa Joe as the special enforcer - Just as a side note for those who remember, yes this is the same exact main event from the year before (including Joe being the enforcer) with the only difference being that Angle & Cage have switched roles.  What can I say about their TNA matches that I haven't said before in that they have good chemistry and it results in great wrestling matches with this being no exception with some moments like the various counters done for moves like the Unprettier, ankle lock, and Olympic Slam.  Joe only came into play on a few occassions like stopping Angle from using a chair, shoving Angle back after Kurt did it to him first, and at the end where he stopped Karen & Styles from interfearing.  The ending came when Tomko cost Cage the match resulting in Angle once again retaining the TNA Championship.

Overall, this was TNA's best card in the past couple of months as there really wasn't a bad match or a moment that you would want to press the skip button on here.  This is a TNA event I recommend.",1203638400,6,5659,4.50587084148728
