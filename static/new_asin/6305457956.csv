7891350,4,6305457956,"This show involves the adventures of a boy named mark, who is temporairaly in the land of living hats, Lidsville. There mark must fight off the evil magician of Lidsville, Hoo-Doo. If you don't have an imagination, or if you do and don't know how to stretch it, avoid this show. Butch [Eddie Munster] Patrick does a good job as mark, and Charles Nelson Reilly is great as Hoo-Doo. I think this is the Kroffts brothers best show, but I gave it four stars because of the amount of episodes on a tape.",1067040000,,498,4.365591397849462
