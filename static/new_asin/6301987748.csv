7819339,5,6301987748,"i've had this video in the family for years... until it randomly disappeared at my uncle's house.
not mocking on him, it just happened to disappear after he took it.
pretty rad, right?
i was so relieved to find this vhs, and in great condition.  i think it was recorded in 1983 or 1985 maybe... as old if not older than i am, anyway. i'm glad to have it back.",1388966400,,359,4.128571428571429

7819341,3,6301987748,"The Amazon listing contains cast and crew information referring to Louie Anderson's 1996 TV series, which is what I assumed I was getting.  It is actually a recording of his standup comedy act from 1988, NOT his 1996 TV show.  Still funny, but not what the listing information implied.",1357603200,,285,4.795918367346939
7819342,5,6301987748,Louie Anderson is one of our favorite comedians. He makes us laugh so hard we cry. We love it this video. We just wish we could find it in DVD.,1323302400,,143,3.8
7819343,5,6301987748,"Because of some embarrassing gossip 'Louie Anderson'  has basically vanished and it's a shame because he is a very funny guy.  I had not seen this set in many years and I bought  a used VHS of this show to see if it was as funny  as I remembered.  It most certainly is and it's refreshing to find a guy who is this funny who doesn't rely on profanity to make his jokes work. Don't get me wrong I love my vulgar gutter mouthed comedians as much as the next person, but the joke has to be there first.

This is a great set from the big man doing some of his best stuff, but like most comedians, they tend to ramble in the middle for a while on a over long gag. Louie's set has very little down time and is just as funny now as when it came out. This should be available on DVD, what a shame so many people are missing this show.",1251504000,4,826,3.9161676646706587
7819344,5,6301987748,"This is one of those video's you can watch once a month and still find hilarious 3 years later.  My copy is wearing out and soon I'll have to replace it, especially now that my 9yr old daughter has discovered it.  His humor is timeless.",1213228800,,236,4.222222222222222
7819345,3,6301987748,"This was a funny video, and I'm glad I watched it.  I bought it due to the Amazon site listing Joanna Gleason as the director.  The problem is that her name is no where in any of the credits.  Someone else is listed as the director.  So, if you're a Joanna Gleason fan (rare, I know), kindly move along.  But, for anyone who likes a good stand up routine, this is a fine video.",1198022400,2,377,4.04054054054054
7819346,4,6301987748,This was without a doubt one of the funniest videos I have ever seen. Everyone who has watched it agrees. His facial expressions are priceless!!,1004400000,3,144,4.8
