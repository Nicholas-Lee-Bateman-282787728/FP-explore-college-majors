It has great tips where to, how to and nice entertainment for the detectorist who wants some good solid back to basics knowledge. Good on screen venue to choose from and clear on screen video that is well done. Even if video doesn't show all the latest detectors it applies to all basics a plus in my opinion.  No disappointments with this video.  P.S. I bought this product several years ago and with my 39 years experience you will like this video basic plus it does come in dvd.",1515715200,,530,4.343434343434343
