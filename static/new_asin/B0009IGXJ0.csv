Although it has a laugh track, which I normally can't stand, it was low key, sounded genuine, and wasn't at all bothersome. Even for a non--albeit, wannabe--Brit, the references were not too obscure to get most of the word play and jokes. A few I didn't get, like George Formby--possibly from a later season, I googled and learned a bit more about Brit history. Although the subtitles were not very helpful--my smart tv is doing that on its own right now--their accents were not at all difficult for a US audience. The plot and the characters had an endearing, sometimes bittersweet character, and even somewhat over-the-top traits and plot twists felt totally believable, thanks to the terrifically talented cast. The juxtaposition of the two time periods was intriguing and well-done, and watching this with the distance of another twenty years adds yet another interesting perspective, while the series itself never felt dated. I usually don't watch sitcoms, like never, but I enjoyed every moment of this series and found myself binge watching. while dreading the end ot the last season, as I know there's no chance it will be renewed, sigh.",1522886400,,1325,5.08256880733945

of the PAL standard. It was delightful to get this program.  I must
confess that plots that go back in time do not generally
appeal to me, but this is an exception. The stories are believable
and the perfomances are spot on. The period details are well judged
and what more can I say?",1335830400,3,334,4.21875
