5622922,1,B00BINM9E8,"This is one of the worst movies I have bought in some time. The cinematography was pretty bad ""DARK"" as in the name both visually and emotionally... most of the time. It is clearly displaying people at their absolute lowest, no real plot.. if your interested in crude, vulgar, violent and just plain nasty... well then you might like this. I threw it away. I like Australian movies, I usually like the scenery, but not this one the only pretty scene in the whole movie was in the last 2 minutes and the sun was actually out.",1374364800,2,524,4.412371134020619
5622923,5,B00BINM9E8,"Dark Frontier is a great film! Tons of tension and very thrilling.

A religious English father moves his family to the Australian wild west and struggles to survive. A group of ex-soldiers arrive and promise help, but things soon fall apart. Greed, family, and man's corruption are the focus.

A must watch with beautiful cinematography and great performances from Aden Young and the child actors.",1369267200,6,397,5.092307692307692

8569047,1,B00BINM9E8,"The film had a good story plot to it. The photography was excellent. The sound effects and other sounds sucked ruining the whole movie. The CC di not fit the scene. It was several scenes out of synch and so was the speaking parts. This film needs some changes real bad to make it an enjoyable experience to watch, buy, or rent.",1462752000,,327,4.290322580645161
8569048,1,B00BINM9E8,"Could not watch it. The sound was totally out of sink. Also, Amazon charged me $2.99 when the info on the screen was 1.99 for HD.",1461110400,,129,4.0
8569049,2,B00BINM9E8,"I tried twice to see if the picture would line up with the sound and neither time worked.  I tried watching it but it was so badly out of sync, it was hard to keep on top of what was going on so I finally gave up.  I would like credit for this movie, Amazon.  As for the movie itself, I didn't like the ""feel"" of it...it made me feel yucky.  BLAH!",1459123200,,347,3.7777777777777777
8569050,5,B00BINM9E8,"If I could give it 4.5 rather than 5 stars I would. For 5 stars I would have to be completely unaware of time for all but the first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. I can't say that about this movie. Also, the denouement is a little too long for my tastes.

That being said, this is an awesome movie that cuts straight to the heart of the human condition. I also think that it is a very fitting allegory for the depredations and iniquities of the 19th century and how it ended up shaping the mechanistic and fragmented 20th century and all of the horrors that would eventually come to pass.",1457395200,,587,4.149122807017544
