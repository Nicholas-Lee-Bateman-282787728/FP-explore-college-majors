4484805,5,B004VW4VCQ,I used this in the earth science class I teach the last two years. It is truly a gripping video.,1338508800,2,96,3.85
4484806,5,B004VW4VCQ,"This video tells it all. When the tragick event of March 11, 2011 happened; the world saw severity of Earth problems. At first we think we are in total control; but with out warning nature could literally take our homes away. This video teaches; never think the Coast is a great place to live and settle into. At any moment you dream to stare at Whales, Sharks and Sea Birds can turn into the you staring at a completelly ravaged personal property.
The Earth is unpredictable and God is not your best friend. Some times he is your enemy; some time he is not.
Watch and enjoy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOVA-Killer-Quake/dp/B000C8STP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOVA - Killer Quake!</a>",1329436800,2,734,5.504424778761062
4484807,5,B004VW4VCQ,"What an extrodinair DVD. This added so much more than the news carriers showed on TV. This shows the true nature of the Tsunami's power. I lived 9 years in japan and I feel so sorry for all thoes that lost their lives and everything. I am now worried about the northern coast of the USA, cascadia fault zone...",1328054400,,310,4.271186440677966
4484808,4,B004VW4VCQ,"This is a good DVD and shows how the earth shifted causing not only the earthquake but also the tsuami. If you want to learn more, by all means this DVD is for you.",1326067200,,164,3.8529411764705883
4484809,5,B004VW4VCQ,"I found this video very Touching even for a documentary, I'am a very big fan of japan and I love the people and there culture. I felt sad when the earthquake happened I found this video to be very informative and very sad. The Japanese people are a neat and interesting culture, They have there problems But still I felt sorry for a culture that influences the US allot and the same for them from the US.

Great video for info and story.",1311379200,4,437,4.265060240963855
4484810,3,B004VW4VCQ,"and it can be seen on the PBS website.  It does give some good information on the hows and they whys of the earthquake, tsunami and even touches lightly on the effects of Fukushima.  I watched the whole thing online (until my overseas ISP got blocked) and found it interesting soon after the disaster.  The DVD itself was put out much later (late May) and I was expecting some updated information and more of an appreciation of the effects on the people, economy and life of Japan.

The human toll was given some lip service (ie projections on final numbers of dead and missing) but there were scant views of the powerful effects on actual individuals.  The best was at the beginning where a woman was shown looking at the devastation, but you really had no idea what she was looking for or who she was missing.  There are so many poignant stories out there and barely anything was shown from the human side--the degree of suffering that was being dealt with, and the responses of the Japanese people.  I really felt like this was a missed opportunity.

Not only that, though the footage shown was impressive, moreso would have been the footage of the actual swamping of the Fukushima plant for example.  Or the burning of the refineries in Chiba.  Many, many more.  Simply skimming YouTube showed me much more powerful scenes than many that were chosen for this documentary.

I think what was present on the DVD was interesting (hence the three stars), but frankly seeing Hawaii hit by a 3 foot wave was not as significant as the devestation of Sendai and it's surroundings.  Not that it wasn't of note, but if you only have an hour for a documentary, well, there were a lot of more powerful images and storylines to examine.

I wish it had kept it's content and added at least another half an hour.  Given the timing of the release between when the information appeared on PBS and when the DVD came out, it seems as though there could have been a lot of updating of the overall (and ongoing) impact.

Perhaps I suffer from being to close to the event, but I was disappointed in the DVD.

Interesting, but nothing you can't find on the website, and there is so much more than what is on that DVD.

Not really recommended--just look at it on PBS.  At least my money went to a non-profit I can appreciate, otherwise I'd want it back.

4484811,5,B004VW4VCQ,"I had the opportunity to already view this documentary, and it has very dramatic footage of the quakes happening, the tsunami and a time line of everything happening and why it happens the science behind it.  You will be amazed at what nature can do.  Highly recommend it, I will watch it several times.",1302998400,11,303,4.592592592592593

8444158,5,B004VW4VCQ,Great documentary that I use to illustrate seismic waves in my science classroom. Detailed and appropriate for both middle school and high school students. NOVA delivers once again.,1395014400,,181,5.5
8444159,5,B004VW4VCQ,"Nova is known for first rate documentaries and this is a fine one. This one shows in detail all that happened in Japan's great quake, but the explanations as to why things happened as they did were not glossed over or left out and spoken about in detail by geologists and other scientists, some that were in Japan and witnessing the event first hand. The footage shown of the disaster was very startling and saddening, but there is much to be learned from events like these, which is why I recommend this to anyone interested in disasters.",1393804800,3,539,4.56701030927835
