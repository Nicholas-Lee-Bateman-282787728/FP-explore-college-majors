7988359,5,B00008ZL7H,"This is the action packed video with sexy woman, bad [apple] main actor, some violence and great fight scene. About the drug cartel on Mexican border. Saw lots of action with a good storyline. The girls are hot. The scenes in Mexico made me laugh my guts out.  Hope there is a sequel.",1058832000,,284,4.3584905660377355
7988360,5,B00008ZL7H,"This action packed film has all the trademarks of a classic.  Romance, exotic locales, fist fights, and a mean hombre as a villain.  Orsen Welles would be proud.",1056412800,,161,4.714285714285714
7988361,5,B00008ZL7H,"Words fail to describe this masterpiece.  If only all movies had such great performances, moral vision, and an undeniable touch of genius.  ""Pico de Gallo"" tells the story of a young man on a quest in Mexico to hunt down the deadliest assassin in history.  Our protagonist, Gideon (no doubt influenced from the same legendary warrior in the Bible) befriends a drunken small town reporter named Drake to help him.  They venture into the God forsaken interior of Mexico and are nearly murdered every step of the way by highly trained assassins and thugs.  The wide assortment of evil forces against Gideon is unbelievable.  The blood thirsty villains have names like Jimmy the Shark, Hernando the Owl, Mickey the Maggot, and so on.  Each thug tries to stop Gideon from finding their leader named ""El Gallo"".  No other film has ever created a villain so despicable and evil incarnate.  ""El Gallo"" controls all of the drug smuggling between northern Mexico and Texas with an iron fist.  There is a scene within the movie where ""El gallo"" brutally tortures an informer. The atrocity was so graphic I couldn't forget it for weeks.  Besides incredible action sequences, hand to hand fights, knife fights, pick axe battles, fast cars...there are also beautiful women.  Gideon goes undercover and seduces a hot drug traffiker named Ashley who works for ""El Gallo"".  There are also plenty of laughs, although it is difficult to know when to laugh in certain parts of the movie because the subject material is so banal.  But I suspect the dialogue is pretty authentic in drug dealing circles.  Overall, the movie is not just cheap entertainment but a true epic that will certainly be remembered a hundred years from now.  Pure geniuis!",1056412800,,1724,4.893103448275862
