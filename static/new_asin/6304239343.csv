822633,5,6304239343,"Anthony Mann with no budget and not much of a script creates a terrific little thriller. There are simply classic sequences thanks to some brilliant cinematography.
The film is very episodic and does not realy hang together, but some of the shots are superb. The opening murder of an informant has one of the bext scenes where a murderer literally is absorbed by the darkness. The execution in the steam room is filled with horror.

822634,4,6304239343,"VCI Entertainment, a small video company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is releasing DVDs of ""RAW DEAL"" and ""T MEN,"" two forgotten noir B movie classics directed by Anthony Mann.
Allegedly taken from a closed Treasury Department file (the ""Shanghia Paper"" case), ""T Men"" (1947) is a clever crime drama that's shot in a documentary style for added realsim.  The meticulously detailed set-up is kind of slow going, but the payoff is gangbusters (literally).  Dennis O'Keefe and Alfred Ryder are Treasury agents who go undercover, disguised as mobsters, to infiltrate a ring of Detroit based liquor cutters known to be using bogus revenue stamps.  The gang's savage leader has already killed a fellow T Man.  For the agents, there is almost a perverse emphasis on how they must shut down all normal human feelings to successfully accomplish their missions -- even to the point of standing by while a fellow agent is executed in cold blood.  There's no question about the dark noir terrain in this terrific little thriller that is all the more effective thanks to John Alton's brilliant, precise, geometrically composed cinematography.
A surprisingly gripping film with a stunning climax.  Definitely worth considering if you're looking for those forgotten noir gems.",1022716800,28,1252,5.203980099502488

Before he found fame as a director of westerns, Anthony Mann directed shoestring-budget B-crime thrillers, of which T-Men is the best (better than Raw Deal, much better than Railroaded.)  The pseudo-documentary approach combines with John Alton's brilliant underlit noirish cinematography to create a potent brew; engaging, almost mesmerizing.  You hate to see the story come to an end.

823174,3,6304239343,"Out In The 1940s Film Noir Night- T For Trouble- T For Treasury Man-Anthony Manns T-Men- A Film Review
From The Pen Of Frank Jackman
T-Men, starring Dennis OKeefe, directed by Anthony Mann, Eagle Lion Productions, 1947

No question, at least in my mind, the police procedural noirs from the 1940s and 1950s are the weakest form of the genre. Especially when, like the film under review, Anthony Manns T-Men they are essentially a propaganda documentary for some governmental agency. Here the Treasury Departments counterfeiting squad gets the shining glowing light treatment. The main problem with this sub-genre is that unlike a femme fatale-driven noir where we hope the femme does not rough up the guys too badly or a private detective entry where we wish the tough gumshoe success for his client we know from the beginning that the bad guys, here a nation-wide syndicate passing bad dough and bad liquor stamps, is doomed to fail.

A run through of the plot-line here tells the tale. Seems Uncle Sam (thats us) is miffed that post-World War II bad guy gangs are passing bad paper and nicking the government (thats you and me, okay) of its liquor revenues, nicking it big time. Naturally this thumb in the eye has all the top Washington Treasury bureaucrats (thats not you and me but our public servants) screaming bloody murder. So naturally to figure out how the nation-wide operation was succeeding and putting a stop to it there had to be a sting operation. A sting operation which includes two T-men , two keen agents, including the key agent (played by Dennis OKeefe) working their way into the operation to see who Mister Big is and to grab him and put him away for about 99 years, or life anyway.

So the two agents dot the is and cross the ts by working their way up in the organization starting in poor benighted Detroit and crossing the country to sunnyland LA. Their work gets them so far but the organization did not get to the organization by being saps for undercover cops and they get a little hip to the fact that one of the agents does not seen to be on the square. And so they in time-honored tradition waste the agent which our boy Dennis OKeefe watched in horror. But that is really the end of the drama because as every film noir aficionado knows, knows 101, once a cop, a good guy, get wasted by bad guys or femmes then the old adage about crime does not pay comes home with a vengeance. And that is about it, except that any Anthony Mann film is worth watching for the cinematography, the great black and white shadow photography, and the nice pacing.",1394841600,,2578,4.587852494577007
823175,4,6304239343,"Directed by the great Anthony Mann, this semi-documentary rises far above the stilted voice-over of the set-up and settles down to a taut tale about US Treasury agents infiltrating a counterfeiting gang. Several brilliant scenes ratchet up the suspense, especially one of the gang cooking a fellow crook to death in a steam bath and another in which one of the T-Men has to stand by and watch his partner murdered. Excellent performances, notably Dennis O'Keefe, Alfred Ryder, Wallace Ford and the incomparable Charles McGraw. A must for the noir collector.",1389830400,3,557,5.131868131868132

It's not at all in the same league as his ""Raw Deal"" which is arguably the best forties noir movie ever.  The whole movie is narrated like Dragnet.  Some deep-voiced guy explains everything for you in between and over scenes that pretend to be a re-enactment of a ""true"" Secret Service case, like a docudrama.  It simply didn't hold my interest.  The lighting and direction is breathtaking since it's Mann so I guess for four bucks it's worth watching for the visuals but the movie as a whole IMHO was only interesting as a Mann artifact.",1386460800,,613,4.536363636363636

823282,4,6304239343,"T-Men stands for ""Treasury Men"" potrayed by Dennis O'Keefe and Alfred Ryder who take the difficult assignment of infiltrating a vicious counterfeiting ring and trying to find the unknown boss and the high quality paper being used to make the almost undetectable fake bills. The two agents succeed in joining the San Francisco conterfeiting gang by first joining a detroit gang, then moving west using two high quality money plates to get in with the counterfeiters. The T-men know that the printing expert employed by the counterfeiters could spot the source of the money plates, and expose them as agents putting them in constant danger. The married agent accidentally runs into his wife and her best freind while he is with a gang member, and his wife's freind blows his cover with tragic results. He protects the other agent's cover with his last words, and the other agent goes on to uncover the counterfeiter's secret printing shop on a ship where the treasury forces and counterfeiters have a big shoot-out.
The movie is directed by Anthony Mann who knows how to direct good film noir. The print quality and sound are both quite good.

This is a fine, gritty, film noir, directed by Anthony Mann and filmed by John Alton. It's done in a ""semi-documentary"" style, with periodic ""voiceovers"" explaining to the viewer how the Treasury Department does its job---the film does for the Treasury Department what, THE STREET WITH NO NAME, did for the FBI. Dennis O'Keefe plays a ""T-Man"" who goes undercover with a partner in order to break up a counterfeiting ring. Although the ""voiceovers"" become a little tiresome, the movie is well-paced and the plot is engrossing. Wallace Ford is good as a sleazy little guy known as, ""The Schemer"", who overestimates his ability to ""scheme"" his way out of things. Charles McGraw is excellent as a vicious hood---but then, that's his forte, isn't it! Naturally, after a few close calls, O'Keefe succeeds in bringing down the counterfeiters.

Once the introductions are over and the dramatization of the case begins, the film overflows with startling black-and-white contrasts and interesting camera angles. Director Anthony Mann and photographer John Alton were at the top of their game and the DVD transfer enhances their work. I have this as part of an Anthony Mann Film Noir 3-Pack.

The great photography more than makes up for the fact that the story is just so-so.  However, the story does feature the typically-tough film noir characters and some great suspense over the last 10-15 minutes. What you have to wade through is the boring beginning but staying with it will reward you.

823286,4,6304239343,"The collaboration of Mann and Alton created some of the most interesting films in the Film Noir genre. Sadly, these great films from extinct minor studios survive in poor condition.
This Sony T-Men DVD was mastered from a worn copy of the original film. Like its companion film ""Raw Deal"", this film was ""enhanced"" to make it more appealing to a wider audience. Alton's great high-contrast photography has been brightened-up in a way where it loses much of the romanticism and drama present in the original untouched film. This process is far worse on ""Raw Deal"" which looses all its great contrast and dark shadows. T-Men still retains much of its original mystery and darkness.
I prefer the old King Video issues of these films. The film images were unenhanced with a softer focus but the chiaroscuro shadows and film noir dramatic lighting are all there. These DVDs also had a short documentary on each disc discussing Mann, Alton's photography, and film noir.
You can see an unrestored version of Alton's photography in the cheap Alpha Video version of ""The Big Combo"".
I think Dennis O'Keefe is quite good in this film; I'm surprised that he wasn't in more movies of this era.

The picture is a little shifty, slightly jumpy.  It doesn't seem to be the entire picture that moves at times, or at least it manages to shift slightly in different directions; up, down, left, right.  In short, imagine watching a movie projected into a waterbed, thats the best comparison I can think of.

For anyone who loves film noir, you want you're darkest shadows completely black; there are times, mostly toward the beginning of the film when the darkest areas of the screen here are more dark grey.  There's an unmoving grey tint over the black, its a little like looking at something black with a grey mesh like a screen door between you and it.

The audio is generally good, some buzzing in a few areas.

I am not one who typically worries about the best quality, which is part of the reason I am struggling to explain the shortcomings of this transfer with examples that hopefully people can relate to.

Exploring the grey area between sanctioned undercover work and out-of-control criminal behavior, ""T-Men"" plunges deep into the shadowy world of the thug's life, with a serpentine plot and gritty, lock-jawed performances from the B-movie cast. Aside from its rough-hewn realism, Mann's film is a triumph of stylish production design and Alton's brilliant chiaroscuro visuals. Capped by a steam-bath murder that will snatch your breath away, ""T-Men"" is a crackling tale of claustrophobic tension.",1182729600,2,711,5.980392156862745
823425,4,6304239343,"Nietzsche wrote ""he who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.""  The exploration of this idea is often the underlying theme of undercover agent films like ""Donnie Brasco,"" ""Deep Cover"" and even to some degree, ""The Departed.""  All of these films are indebted to Anthony Mann's almost forgotten noir classic, ""T-Men"" - a film that represents one of the first instances where the story focuses on men who sacrifice their souls (and in one case a life) as they descend into the criminal underworld to serve the law.  The title is the street name for treasury agents, who are here assigned to infiltrate a counterfeiting ring.  As they adopt the identities of criminals they make compromises of increasing magnitude to protect their covers and in the process become less distinguishable from the people they are trying to apprehend.  The film expresses this process visually by showing them stepping in and out of shadows, literally, to echo what's happening morally, following a genre convention that still manages to look fresh because of John Alton's stunning cinematography.  Aside from the hokey documentary-style narration, the film feels incredibly modern.

""T-Men"" is an essential film of the film noir genre worthy of wider recognition.  Like many other films of the genre, only the budget was at a B level.",1172016000,2,1341,5.091324200913242
823426,5,6304239343,"The movie starts off as one of those popular police procedure films that glorified law enforcement, especially during the law and order 1950's. However, there's an artistic sensibility underlying this effort that effectively undercuts the documentary conventions. Because about 20 minutes into the photography, the tone becomes steadily darker as the undercover agents plunge deeper into the angular shadows of the L.A. underworld. Unknowingly, they have descended into the claustrophobic twilight of noir, where anything can happen. A cop can even be mudered while his partner stands idly by, thereby breaking all the rules of the time, but affirming our sense that reality is a lot darker than the popular conventions made it out to be.

There are so many imaginative touches that the feeling of a film within a film emerges, one that's striving to burst the bonds of Hollywood's Production Code. The film-makers do their best to keep the climax consistent with the overall mood, but Code demands ultimately prevail such that the viewer may be left unconvinced by the round-up happy ending. It's this friction between convention and artistry, between the predictable and the unpredictable, that finally splits the film into conflicting, even warring, perspectives. Anyone wishing a glimpse of the contrast between the two, and how Hollywood subordinated art to ideology, should catch up with this 90 minute melodrama.",1163980800,2,1419,5.36322869955157

Dark and moody with genuine suspense and plenty of guts.  It's even got an introduction by one of the real life Treasury agents that took down Al Capone.  Worth seeing if you're a noir fan.  Or crime buff.  Or just interested in watching an old film that has aged remarkably well.

823428,5,6304239343,"Not all Film Noir is sinister, negative, or about gangsters. Some of it is about detectives and undercover cops, and is very heroic. What I like best about it are the low-key lighting effects and extreme camera angles, the grittiness and heightened drama and action, as well as the effects designed to create a mood of mystery, like fog. How could you not create a great suspense thriller in a setting like that?

For this genre, one of the finest directors was Anthony Mann, and one of the most interesting actors was Dennis O'Keefe. Their pairing in T-MEN and RAW DEAL delivers two of the best examples of Film Noir, though not nearly as well known as films like The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity. Mann was a top-notch director who went on to direct Jimmy Stewart in such westerns as Winchester '73, Bend of the River, The Far Country, and The Man From Laramie; as well as sand and sandal epics, like El Cid and Fall of the Roman Empire.

O'Keefe was a top-notch actor who did a decade of extra work at the beginning of the sound era, before he was discovered and recommended as a leading man by Clark Gable. After that he starred in a variety of comedies and dramas in the 40's and 50's. He also worked for the fledgling medium of television, making guest appearances on such shows as Robert Montgomery Presents, Studio One, and Lux Video Theatre; as well as starring in his own TV show in 1959. He's a very likable actor, even when he plays a convict.

In T-MEN, O'Keefe and a fellow treasury detective go undercover and risk their lives to break up a counterfeiting ring. In RAW DEAL, O'Keefe plays a wrongly convicted felon who escapes from prison looking for revenge, kidnaps his lawyer's secretary who has been visiting him in prison, and is ultimately redeemed by her from his course of self-destruction. There is actually a double-redemption in RAW DEAL that gives it a nice twist.

About the cinematography: John Alton gives a visual look to these two films that can only be described as powerful. In RAW DEAL, the scene on the boat with the clock in the background will never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. The scenes in the steam baths in T-MEN, and the fight scene in the backroom of the beachside shop in RAW DEAL are also memorable.

823430,5,6304239343,"""T-Men"" represented the first of the great film noir trilogy combining the unique talents of director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton.  Their efforts revealed that in the film noir genre with its emphasis on gritty realism, with authentic street locations often in the darkness of late evening, that it was possible to achieve films of high quality at a low cost.  The Mann-Alton trilogy was the product of Eagle-Lion Studios, one of the smallest in Hollywood, but known for top suspense dramas producing optimum bang for  dollars

invested.

The other two films in the trilogy that followed ""T-Men"", which debuted in 1947, were released one year later.  ""He Walked by Night"" was, like ""T-Men"" a noir docudrama while ""Raw Deal"" was a thriller about a prison escapee's adventures.

Starring in both ""T-Men"" and ""Raw Deal"" was Dennis O'Keefe.  The tall, athletically constructed actor's forte was the ability to combine ruggedness with a street-smart demeanor that enabled him to reveal smoothness when the occasion warranted it.  This blend made him a natural for the lead role of a United States Treasury Agent posing as a criminal syndicate tough guy.

Reed Hadley narrates the hard-hitting semi-documentary set on the streets of Los Angeles.  Much of the action occurs in Ocean Park in seedy hotels and mob hangouts.  The film is based on the actual Shanghai Paper Case that occurred shortly after World War Two with the film being made soon after its solution.  Adventure script specialist John C. Higgins kept the action moving at a brisk clip, as did director Mann, while Alton's brooding photography invigorated some of the city's seamiest spots with chilling drama in generating perpetual viewer curiosity.

The Washington office was able to piece together a sketch of a conduit passing counterfeit checks in Los Angeles.  O'Keefe and partner Alfred Ryder are dispatched to Los Angeles to track the wanted individual down and ultimately blend into the organization before assisting the Treasury Department in shutting down the enterprise.  To provide pedigree they assume bogus identities and masquerade as former mob operatives in Detroit, where so much of the counterfeit money has been sent.

When O'Keefe arrives in Los Angeles he capitalizes on the two clues pertaining to the mystery counterfeit conduit of digesting Chinese herbs and taking frequent steam baths by tracking him down.  O'Keefe notes that he lost eight pounds in the process after taking  steam baths in so many Los Angeles spots.

Veteran character actor Wallace Ford delivers one of his finest efforts as the counterfeit mob legman known appropriately as Schemer, who has settled in Los Angeles after a previous underworld stint in Detroit.  At that point he sends for partner Ryder and they use Schemer's contacts to become members of the mob.  In the process they encounter the mob's brutally sadistic enforcer Charles McGraw, whose manner is reminiscent of Neville Brand in ""D.O.A."".

One of the film's most fascinating scenes emerges when Agent Ryder's wife June Lockhart is vacationing in Los Angeles and the girlfriend with whom she is traveling approaches Ryder when she sees him with Wallace Ford.  Since his mob identity is that of a single man he seeks to bluff his way through the potentially fatal encounter when Lockhart, realizing the circumstances, tells her friend that she is crazy and that her husband is ""taller and better looking"" than Ryder.",1121299200,6,3455,5.1395348837209305
823431,5,6304239343,"People often never ask me ""What film would be a good starting point if I wanted to learn about film noir?"", but if they did ask me one of the films at the top of my list would be T-MEN. A lot of noirs have all kinds of crazy twists and double-crosses and triple-crosses and it's sometime hard to follow, but T-MEN is very straightforward and enjoyable, not to mention the amazing cinematography by John (RAW DEAL, THE BIG COMBO) Alton who had one of the best quotes ever by a cinematographer: ""It's not what you light - it's what you don't light.""

Anyway, the story is told in a semi-documentary style complete with a narrator. There's a counterfeiting gang run out of Los Angeles that the Treasury Department has been after for awhile, but the only lead they have is there's a connection with another gang in Detroit, so they send two T-men undercover to infiltrate the gang and see what they can find out. That's all you really need to know. I've seen the film a number of times and still I get really into the story, especially the first half where they are working their way into the gang's confidence.

The direction by Anthony Mann is great as is the acting by everybody involved. The main T-man is played by Dennis O'Keefe who's definitely not a household name, but I've always found his career to be fascinating. As far as I can tell there's never been a book written about him, but I've noticed him quite playing a bit parts in various movies, so I found out who he was, looked him up and he's (according to IMDb) been in over 253 movies and TV shows!!! Usually just as a bit part or an extra but still he's been in a ton of films including DUCK SOUP, I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, SCARFACE, LIBELED LADY and even his own TV show that only last 18 episodes! Anyway I just thought that was interesting, because nowadays only the biggest of movie nerds would even know who he was.

Back to T-MEN, one of my favorite scenes has this one guy talking tough right before they kill him, they shoot him and as he's falling down he gasps, full of venom, ""You...sucker!"" What a badass! LOL. Great movie and worthy of earning a spot in your movie collection.

Another plus for T-MEN is Jack Overman actually gets some respectable screen time. Good for him!",1113782400,7,2260,4.399521531100478
823432,5,6304239343,"""T-Men"" is a film noir made in a pseudo-documentary style. The story is introduced by none other than Elmer Irey, the former chief coordinator of law enforcement agencies in the Treasury Department and a famous T-man himself.  Irey was one of the federal agents who nailed Al Capone, one of several high-profile cases that highlighted his career. Here he is, telling us about the 6 crime-fighting units of the Treasury Department and introducing the story as a composite of real cases in which undercover T-men busted a major counterfeiting ring. We are guided through the film by a narrator who casts the Treasury Department agents in a heroic light, periodically explaining their actions and the progress of the case.

When an informant on a counterfeiting case in Detroit is killed, the Treasury Department gives up on conventional means of bringing the gang to justice. They decide to plant 2 undercover agents among the criminals instead, hoping to learn the source of a new, very authentic paper that is being used to make funny money. Agents Dennis O'Brien (Dennis O'Keefe) and Tony Genaro (Alfred Ryder) insinuate themselves into a gang of bootleggers and counterfeiters in Detroit. When they learn that a trafficker named Schemer (Wallace Ford) may lead them to the source, O'Brien goes to Los Angeles to track him down. O'Brien uses his promise of superior plates, confiscated from an imprisoned engraver, to bargain for a partnership with the counterfeiters who have the paper. But twists of fate and the vagaries of gangsters threaten to expose the T-men before they can incriminate the top man.

""T-Men""'s visual style is characterized by some of the most high-contrast photography I have seen. Most of the film takes place in sunny California, and the outdoor scenes were filmed in bright sunshine, creating a stark contrast of brightly lit highlights and black shadows cast by the sun. Add to that unusual camera positions, deep focus, wet city streets at night, and characters photographed in silhouette. John Alton's cinematography is a textbook example of the noir visual style and even more heavy-handed than is typical. But it's striking. There is something very dark about agents O'Brien and Genaro's character, too, although they are the ""good guys"". The heroic narration that champions the agents' work belies the brutality of what we see. The criminals are brutal, but the agents are consumed by their roles. Nothing seems to distinguish them from the underworld around them. The film's arresting style and the eerie too-convincing performances of the agents disarm the audience with visual and moral confusion, making ""T-Men"" consummate film noir.

The DVD (VCI Entertainment 2002 release): Bonus features include trailers for ""Back from Eternity"" (2 minutes), ""Kiss Me Deadly"" (2 minutes), and ""The Big Heat"" (1 1/2 minutes). There is a short documentary entitled ""Dark Reflections, Part I"" (6 minutes), narrated by Max Allan Collins, the prolific and diverse crime novelist and comic book author. Collins discusses the noir motifs in ""T-Men"" and ""Raw Deal', which were both directed by Anthony Mann, filmed by John Alton, and starred Dennis O'Keefe. ""Dark Reflections, Part 2"" can be found on the ""Raw Deal"" DVD. There are no subtitles available for the film.",1111708800,2,3286,5.159474671669794

7866379,5,6304239343,"T-MEN (SPECIAL EDITION) is a definite improvement to my previous Classic Media Gangsters Guns and Floozies Crime collection (2005 no extras) dvd.
The picture - although not remastered - is a little bit brighter and the two bonus features include an interview with Anthony Mann's daughter, Nina, as well as another 10 minute documentary titled Into the Darkness:  Mann, Alton, and T-Men.  The movie commentary by biographer Alan K Rode is, also, quite informative.
Also of note is the 'thick' booklet well written by film historian Max Alvarez with additional 'still movie photos' and a couple behind the scene snapshots of Mann, Alton, O'Keefe, et cetera.  I, personally, find the 'color' artwork posters 'of the day' gaudy and not complimentary to the exemplary black-and-white camera work of John Alton; and the fine set-up direction of Anthony Mann.
T-MEN is brilliant to look at.  Admire this documentary world (as narrated by Reed Hadley - kind of propaganda-government cheesy actually) and that wonderful 'deep focus.'
It is not an exaggeration to credit the Mann-Alton team as the most influential and stunningly creative visual duo in the history - in what would become known as - film noir (by the French in early 1960's).  Take note of the references to Raw Deal (1948) in bonus features another great film noir Mann-Alton creation that was released a year after T-MEN (both starring Dennis O'Keefe).

T-MEN also stars Alfred Ryder as Dennis O'Keefe's partner and undercover, Italian speaking agent.  Charles McGraw almost got type cast as villain after his ""Moxie"" role in T-MEN.
This SPECIAL EDITION (Shout Factory 2017) should rate with anything the Criterion Collection does well.

7866380,4,6304239343,"What's special about this film is the cinematography. I thought the lighting was simply gorgeous. The story itself was just okay as there were a few plot holes. For example, why would the Treasury Department take such a risk and not alert Genaro's wife that he was undercover? Also, why would the Big Boss risk killing The Schemer when he knew he had the revealing book on him?

I give the cinematography by John Alton five stars and the other parts a three-star rating.",1509235200,,470,4.595238095238095
