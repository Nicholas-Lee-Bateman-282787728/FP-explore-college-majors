8237544,5,B0010AP8T2,"This is a great DVD which presents freestyle swimming skills in the same manner as the other very effective GoSwim videos. I like how the skills are broken down and presented in easy-to-understand sections. However, the skills taught seem to be more elite-level, detailed skills for the older, experienced swimmer. For my 11-year old summer-league-only swimmer, the DVD was not as helpful because he is still at the basic level with swimming. We found the bonus materials that showed turns to be the most helpful for him. I was impressed enough with this DVD to purchase a second one for my collge-age swimmer and she found Schoeman's tips to be very helpful. The best part of this DVD is the interview section. Schoeman says that he was not a good swimmer as a child and that he did not really start competitive swimming until he was 16. He later became a world champion in college. This is very inspirational for the aspiring swimmer of any age!",1313539200,,947,4.710843373493976
8237545,4,B0010AP8T2,"This brilliant video breaks down Roland's stroke in great detail and gives you points you can easily implement into your own swim practice. I also loved the bonus features showing his favorite drills and his turns and breakoffs.

On the plus side, I'll mention excellent underwater slow motion footage this video provides.

On a minus side, the background tune repeats itself for an hour and becomes really irritating after a few minutes. I wish there was a variety to the music or an option to turn it off somehow.",1219795200,,515,4.775280898876405
8237546,4,B0010AP8T2,"I'm a Masters swimmer who competes mainly in freestyle short distances, so I got this DVD with a hope to get new ideas on how to improve my stroke and this DVD filled its purpose.

What I liked About the DVD -

- His stroke is broken down logically from what Roland does with his hands to how he moves his legs. The video is filmed well, and you see the stroke from all angles.
- The keys to Roland's stroke are easy to remember as you try to implement them at the pool
- I loved all the bonus features, such as his favorite drills, slow motion of break outs and turns and the interview. Very useful.
- The video was a perfect length time-wise. I could watch it in one sitting and not get bored.

Few Things That I think Can Be Improved -

- The music. All throughout the video you hear the same song repeated time after time after time, and after few minutes, it's irritating.
- I wish the video broke down Roland's stroke into how he swims when he sprints and how he swims during his workouts. I understand that the main concepts are the same, but my guess is that the way he kicks and uses his arms while racing 50m freestyle at the Olympics is a bit different than how he swims at regular training session.
- I also wished this video included few tips about Roland's dryland training routine.

Overall, this is a very useful video and I know my stroke have improved since I tried focusing on the points taught in this video, and if you want to cut a few seconds off your best sprint time, this video will show you what to focus on in your pursuit to do that. Since watching this video, I cut my 100m Free time by three seconds (in two months).",1218931200,5,1647,4.166666666666667
