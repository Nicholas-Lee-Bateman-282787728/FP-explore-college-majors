7902870,1,B000003KAT,"Total billshit, I can't believe that this show got five stars. First of all Q has become a cartoon character whether then the character that we grown to love in TNG. This is beyond out of character for him, if you had seen death wish Q is the one that kill Quen and now he decided to fight for his death.
Go and see Sf Debris review of it instead of seening this garage :(",1336694400,,372,3.973333333333333
7902871,4,B000003KAT,"Q caused a lot of problems in his many misadventures on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" but at least Jean-Luc Picard never received the proposition that the captain of ""Voyager"" receives in this episode.  ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Episode 53, ""The Q and the Grey"" (Story by Shawn Piller, Teleplay by Kenneth Biller, Aired November 27, 1996) begins with the crew trying to enjoy watching a supernova when Q (John de Lancie) shows up in the quarters of Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) with a startling proposition: he wants her to be the mother of his child.  Of course, Janeway says no, but Q keeps bothering her about the topic.  Janeway admits that some day she would like to have a child, but not by mating with Q.  This is a good thing, not only because it is the obvious response, but also because a very jealous female Q (Suzie Plakson) who pops up as well.  Meanwhile, ""Voyager"" has witnessed three supernovas in three days and they are suddenly suspicious of Q for yet another reason.  Janeway makes the mistake of asking Q for help and suddenly she is visiting the Q Continuum.  This is where things become even stranger.
To Janeway's ""little"" mind the Q Continuum looks like the antebellum South (i.e., ""Gone With the Wind""), which is appropriate because the Q are in the middle of a civil war.  What does this have to do with Janeway?  Well, it has to do with the other Q who came to Janeway and wanted to commit suicide in Episode 30 ""Death Wish"" during Season 2.  It seems his death has caused a split in the Continuum between those who believe in individualism and the traditionalists, and, believe it or not, Q's proposition to Janeway is an attempt to solve the problem.
Now, I certainly appreciate the idea to follow up on the consequences of what happened in the earlier episode, and I certainly appreciate the idea that the Q Continuum is so far beyond Janeway's understanding that her mind has to translate it into the recognizable images of the Civil War South.  But the visuals just end up striking me as being a bit too silly.  Besides, it is hard to really think of the Q as super beings the more of them you meet.  I know that with great power there is no guarantee of intelligence, but with eternal life you would think experience would teach a few lessons here and there.  I do like the way Janeway is always so reasonable with the Q, treating him like a child, which contrasts nicely with Picard's perpetual exasperation.
Note: For those who are intrigued by the idea of Q as a father, check out Peter David's ""Star Trek"" novel ""Q-Squared,"" which posits that Q was, in point of fact, the father of Trelane, the ""Squire of Gothos"" from the original series.  The parallels between the two characters, in terms of how they both first appeared to the captains of their respective Enterprises, is enough to suggest a strong similarity.  But David also does a nice job of putting Q behind most of the time travel paradoxes that have confronted various Star Trek crews.",1065657600,,2986,4.595103578154426
7902872,5,B000003KAT,"After Voyager's dismal first few episodes I rarely watched it until the sixth season. A handful of wonderful, dazzling episodes in between persuaded me to start watching again, and The Q and the Grey was top among them. The plot twists in Star Trek never fail to amaze me... And what they did with Q's spawn later on was inspired as well.",1047340800,,338,4.467741935483871
7902873,1,B000003KAT,"This is a classic example of a lame ""Lameager"" episode. Taking something from the Next Generation and messing it up, the hallmark of a dismal Voyagaer episode. And the plot! What a disgrace. The whole ""Q"" thing is kind of like playing with dynamite for the Star Trek writing staff: Do it right and it is a thing of beauty to behold. Do it wrong and there is is a big bloody mess stuck to the walls. This is an example of a ""Q"" story blowing up!!",979776000,2,445,4.126436781609195
7902874,4,B000003KAT,"The plot is driven by the idea that Q has to save his race. New blood is needed, and human blood would be the best. In fact: Janeway is selected to mate with Q for her genetic make-up, and abilities to take care of the baby. Needless to sat Janeway is less then thrilled by Q's avances. Things get woorse when Q's omnipotent girlfriend-for-millennia showes up.
This episode has some very comical scenes, and witty bantering.
Q to Janeway: ""I know you're probably asking yourself: 'Why would a brilliant, handsome, dashingly omnipotent being like Q want to mate with a scrawny little bipedal specimen like me?'"" --- Janeway: ""Let me guess: no one else in the universe will have you.""",975110400,11,682,4.691666666666666
