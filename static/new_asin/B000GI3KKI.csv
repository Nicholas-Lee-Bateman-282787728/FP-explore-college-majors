8132735,5,B000GI3KKI,"This DVD contains two episodes of the wonderful PBS series, both centered on farm life.  The first is The Milk Makers.  This book, by Gail Gibbons, is read aloud.  The books covers different kinds of cows and how they are raised, as well as how milk goes from the farm to your table.  This is followed by LeVar Burton learning how to milk a cow, both by hand and with a milking machine.  Then we visit a cheese factory, which was fascinating, even for an adult.  Back on the dairy farm we meet the woman who is in charge of taking care of baby calves. A cartoon features the voice of Marv Albert announcing a basketball game that features the nutrients in milk.

 The second epeisode is How Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash, which is read in turn by actresses playing a child and her mother discussing the child's disasterous field trip to a farm.  Then LeVar shows us a snake, and several children suggest other books we might want to read.  Two girls show us their pigs, and explain why pigs are fun pets.

The activites in the Milk Maker episode are more interesting, but the book The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash is more fun.",1228089600,2,1121,4.341346153846154
