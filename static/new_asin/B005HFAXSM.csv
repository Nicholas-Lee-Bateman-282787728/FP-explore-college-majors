8472934,5,B005HFAXSM,"I ordered this because I am interested in learning more forearm methods and pressure control, as I am a newly graduated massage therapist. This is a very helpful guide and I have incorporated this method into my practice. Shari Auth is a great instructor. The dvd was very calming and easy to follow with the teaching, at the same time.",1448841600,,336,4.616666666666666

8472936,3,B005HFAXSM,"Wanted to add some additional techniques for side lying work, but not really all that impressed with this DVD.  Quality video, just not what I expected at all unfortunately.",1371081600,3,173,4.9655172413793105
8472937,1,B005HFAXSM,"the techniques taught in this dvd are not advanced by any stretch of the word. the dvd is overpriced for what it is, unless you are looking to pay for production quality, which is actually pretty good. my gripe is with the content; there is just not much of value here to justify the $40 price tag. go with the other auth method dvd and stay away from this one.",1366848000,4,361,4.171428571428572
8472938,5,B005HFAXSM,"I am so glad to have found the Auth Method Forearm Massage DVD's because they have helped me to improve my current massage practice greatly. I have been using the techniques I learned from the first video regularly over the past year and a half or so and am now equipped with the more advanced moves as are taught in the new "" A Guide To Side Lying Position"" DVD. I found it easy to learn from and very informational. All I need now is more practice to perfect my new skills. Finding another massage therapist to trade with while watching The Auth Method is a must so that you get a chance to experience the benefits first hand. My clients tell me it is the best massage they've ever had and as an added bonus it's much easier on me!",1335312000,3,733,4.205673758865248
8472939,5,B005HFAXSM,I loved the Auth Method; Forearm Massage: A Guide To Side Lying Position and The Basics CDs.  The forearm method definetly saves your hands.  My clients say it feels great.  It is something I will incorporate into my daily massages.,1320451200,5,232,4.75
