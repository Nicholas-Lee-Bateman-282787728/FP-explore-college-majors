7869260,5,6304390254,"The 'Up Series' represents one of the most fascinating and unusual uses of film in cinema history - a documentary life-long chronicle of the lives of 14 people starting at 7 years old, revisiting them every seven years through age 56 (so far), presented largely through simple, straightforward, beautifully done interviews.

This film is from the middle of that journey. And while it can be enjoyed in a vacuum, the true power of the piece is watching these people through the arc of their whole lives.  Watching one piece out of that context can't have quite the same power.  This is a case where the sum is greater than the parts, even if the parts are all pretty terrific.

In terms of the series as a whole (which I strongly suggest you seek out) - while I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there (especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expense of all else), it's really an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch this remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your own lifetime.

While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note that the first film, 7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point a researcher for the project.",1439856000,,1434,4.697211155378486
7869261,5,6304390254,"Up Series (35 Up episode from 1991) Spotlights Remarkable People, 16 May 2012

The Up Series continues ""56 Up"" (2012 Granada UK) is the latest episode in the series and was aired in the UK two days ago on May 14, 2012. Home video DVD's are not yet available for ""56 Up"" (2012 Granada 2012) from Amazon. Com. It seems there is a delay from the time the newest episode is first aired/ released in the UK and when the USA sees and may purchase it.)

The Up Series (7 Up, Seven Plus Seven, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up, 42 Up, 49 Up and most recently in 2012, 56 Up) is one of the most interesting, remarkable social documentaries ever presented. I screen all episodes every year, and each time, I see new things, learn more.

For me, the two most remarkable and worthy persons profiled are Neil Hughes and Bruce Balden, neither married or materially ""successful"" by the 1991 ""35 Up"" episode, both badgered about that on camera by the off camera interviewer, both stoic and dignified in the face of the negative evaluation the interviewer provides.

Neither man, Hughes or Balden, led conventional, predictable, profitable, ""safe"" lives. Both opted for exploration, adventure, and service to and comradeship with socially unprestigious groups and persons.

Both took enormous chances, and must be accounted brave, noble men for that alone. They didn't ""play it safe."" Both exude an intelligence and a willingness to discuss difficult questions and issues in detail on camera, and neither attack the show they appear on, the thoughtless, implicitly insulting interviewer, or the show's and interviewer's obvious prejudices and agenda for the show itself as a piece of social and political propaganda.

Balden and Hughes use the riveting show as a platform to describe their own lives, ideals, and activities in pursuit of those ideals, activities not supported by outside big money or generous support from family, government, or other sources.

We learn more about the world at the times the episodes are presented (every 7 years starting in 1963.....the most recent one in 2004) from observing and listening to the words and ideas of Bruce Balden and Neil Hughes by far than is true of the other children and adults presented, none of whom departed from the settings where they first appeared at age 7 in 1963.

It's an interesting show, and less spectacular careers and worlds of the children/ adults who traveled different, more predictable and conventional paths than Bruce Balden and Neil Hughes are worth noting and following.

This show began in the middle 1960's as a hatchet job attacking upper class people and decrying poverty in lower social classes, clearly had an agenda supporting the liberal, socialist values and ideals popular and aggressive in the 1960's.

The times changed, but the show has gone on, and it's value is enormous.

7869262,5,6304390254,"You probably already know what this film is about.  I watched ""28 Up"" and was very impressed, this film is even better.  The directer Micheal Apted asks the subjects the same types of questions he asked in ""28 Up"", but this time the questions seem more unrestricted almost to the point of sounding vicious.  Again, we see some interesting changes take place in the people.  Some have divorced, some of the marriages are on the rocks, some have relatives die and some have more uncertainty than they had seven years ago regarding their future.  Bruce, the Oxford trained math teacher still hasn't married and is living in a third world country.  I have a sneeking suspicion that he may have become a muslim; there is a scene of a boy reading the opening muslim prayer but it's not clear whether or not Bruce was praying with him.
Quite a few subjects are brought to tears when discussing family and one has discovered that they have a potentially serious condition which may require surgery.
Neil, an articulate college dropout raised in the suburbs who became homeless has become my favorite subject.  The man is a survivor but obviously having a very hard time.  He is almost brought to tears with some of the questions and appears worse off than he was at 28.  He says some very profound things worth pondering on.
All of the subjects in this film with the exception of Neil and Bruce seem to follow a fairly predictable pattern but are still interesting to listen to see how some of their views have changed over the years.",990576000,,1526,4.622222222222222
7869263,5,6304390254,"I first came on the series with ""28 Up"" which was truly amazing  for an American to see.  Interspersing clips from ""7 Up,""  ""14 Up,"" & ""21 Up"" made it incredible to see the  changes.  In particular, Suzi, a nervous chain-smoking wreck at 21 was a  happy calm mother at 28.  All, in fact (with one sad exception) seemed  incredibly content with their lots--I was reminded of 1984 for some reason.  ""35 Up"" doesn't have quite the contrasts with its predecessors.  It's wonderful to see that, for the most part, all have progressed nicely  in their lives.  (And I've always wondered why no one snapped Bruce up!)  One interesting omission from this one is Peter--he's nowhere to be seen  (& disappointingly, Symon doesn't participate).  The haunting figure,  again, is Neil.  He's a seriously troubled individual, trying hard to cope  with mental illness in an unsympathetic world.  The questions coming at him  from off camera are almost cruel--& his facial reactions to them are  heartbreaking.  It's quite a contrast to the contentment of the others.
If you've never seen this series before, it's definitely worth watching!",968284800,3,1123,4.956756756756757
7869264,5,6304390254,"Perhaps the most telling indictment of class struggles in the world, is this installment-plan documentary by Michael (""The World Is Not  Enough"") Apted that started out in the early 60's as a BBC special in  which a group of 7-year-olds from varying socio-economic backgrounds were  asked simple-but-telling questions about their plans, dreams, and hopes for  their adult futures. Apted has returned every seven years to talk to the  kids again, at 14, 21, 28, and by now even 42, but 35 seems to be ""The  Bitter Years."" Promise yet unfulfilled is the order of the day here...  at least for the non-rich kids.",967939200,,609,4.854368932038835
7869265,5,6304390254,"The premise is simple, and has a sort of 60s naivete about it.  Choose a group of British schoolkids from various socio-economic backgrounds, and follow them every seven years. The fifth installment, 35 Up, catches the  group as they enter mid-life.  The interspersing of the interviews from the  earlier ages of the kids' lives (also documented in 7 Up, etc.) is  extremely effective.  These are genuinely interesting people, and if they  do not quite serve as ""emblems"" of the class-based culture of the  UK that might have been originally envisioned, nonetheless Apted is able to  drive home a number of interesting points about the effect of background  upon one's life.  This is a fascinating, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes  heartbreaking set of vignettes from the life of a gaggle of people.  It's  altogether a welcome relief from the MTV ""Real Life"" or  ""Survivor"" brand of ""real life"" film-making.  The film  series has moved on to ""42 Up"", but 35 Up is a must see  nonetheless.",960854400,6,991,4.975460122699387
7869266,4,6304390254,"This is the second episode available on video (though actually the fifth in the entire series -- see my review and the other info on ""28 Up"") of Michael Apted's incredible experiment: to follow a handful of  English individuals through life by taking a ""video snapshot"" of  them every 7 years.
Some have divorced.  Some have still not married.  Symon, who seemed so stable and good-natured in ""28 Up,"" is  nowhere to be seen, although he will turn up again in ""42 Up.""  John, one of the upper-class toffs who came off so amusingly haughty at 7,  comes back into the game and reveals a side we had not guessed before  (although he speaks of the ""bitter pellet of poison"" the  individuals in this series have to take every seven years).
Neil, the  homeless (and obviously mentally unstable) man in ""28 Up"" who was  so articulate about the stakes even though he couldn't seem to hold it  together enough to sustain a job, apparently came across as some sort of  ""guru of free thought"" and reports getting contacts from all  sorts of people who wanted him to give them the answer. He performs in  amateur theatricals and manages a semblance of stability while remaining on  welfare.
Director Apted quietly poses questions from off-camera,  sometimes pushes his ""friend-subjects"" a little, and they bravely  continue to reveal themselves to us, to the world ... to the infinite  future.  One both envies them for having such a record in hand, and thanks  one's stars that no one has turned such bright lights on our lives.",955670400,5,1517,4.713740458015267
7869267,5,6304390254,"A fascinating insight into the real lives of several ordinairy British people over a span of 28 years - from age 7 to age 35. This documentary attempts to prove the premise that you can ""show me the boy at seven -  and I will show you the man"". A classic, insightful look at the impact  of Britain's social and educational systems on the lives of ordinairy  British people.
As one who was born and raised in England for 27 years, I  saw the characters as startingly close to many of my own childhood and  young adult experiences. One of the characters is so painfully close to  some of my own early experiences, this documentary drew me into a serious  state of introspection. It served as a powerful reminder to me of why I so  love England - and why I'm so glad I no longer live there.
A powerful  documentary, it reveals both the incredible simplicity and complexity of  ordinairy people. Despite its focus on British people and their society,  this documentary will have universal appeal - certainly many of my American  friends seem to have found it equally engrossing.",944524800,7,1074,4.56544502617801
