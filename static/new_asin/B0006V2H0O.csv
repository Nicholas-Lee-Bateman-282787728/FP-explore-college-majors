Ten minutes later my husband said, ""Hey, We'll give it just 5 more minutes and then we do something else.""  It's a hard movie to watch, but an even tougher one to look away from.
The hero (???) is painful to watch, you are so embarrassed for him, but you want him to succeed or grow a backbone or ... something.  And that I think is what made this movie so thought provoking.  It's like Donny Darko, after it's over you go ""what just happened??!!""  Then you realise you've either been had by the director, or you missed something in the movie or...  something.
I give it 4 stars because it requires you actually to think about it afterwards.",1315008000,,802,4.378378378378378
8043515,1,B0006V2H0O,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I watched it for the 2nd time a few years ago (now that I am an adult, the first time I saw it I was a child) and it was so bad that my friends and I could barely stand to watch it sober and wished we had turned the viewing into some sort of drinking game.  In short, I can't believe that this was actually released to DVD, what is this world coming to?",1143158400,,404,3.686046511627907
