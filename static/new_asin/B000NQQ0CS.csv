My youngest child lost interest almost immediately and my older children thought it was just plain silly.  My older children have watched many Spanish dvds geared toward young children that they thought was educational and engaging.  This is NOT one of them.  If you just have to watch this, rent it from the library.",1317081600,,486,4.670588235294118
8180698,1,B000NQQ0CS,"We only watched this once and I regret buying it. There were so many opporunities for them to speak spanish or sing in spanish, on the DVD, but instead the narrators spoke english the whole time! Also, they are not native spanish speakers.  The only words they teach are: mama, papa, familia (family), tia (aunt), tio (uncle), hermana (sister), prima (cousin), etc.

For $20 this is the worst spanish/ english product I've bought, by far.",1219276800,,438,4.826666666666667
8180699,5,B000NQQ0CS,"I have two toddlers ages 2.5 and 1.5 and have been searching for the right vehicle to introduce them to Spanish. I bought all seven of the Kids Love Spanish DVDs because we were wearing out the one we bought originally! My two-year-old is so fascinated with the kids on the video he just sits there and repeats the Spanish words. Working the Spanish vocabulary into our family dinners has become a nightime ritual in our household. I think he has more fun with these words than with new English words because he thinks HE'S teaching US new words that he learned first!

My husband and I feel a lot more comfortable with our kids watching this series than even the popular educational TV programs out there because this feels so much more interactive to us, like we're engaging in a game with our children because we're all so actively involved in learning together. I hope other people's children enjoy this DVD as much as ours do!",1176595200,,931,4.574850299401198
