7794434,5,0971913404,"Having lived on this ranch for 10 years and having seen this video before anyone really knew about it I can say its one great piece of work, amazingly enough i'm in it as a small child about 7 or 8 at the time I am now 28 I have alot of memories of the area and knew almost everyone in the film. If your a cowboy fan this is a great film to get. I highly recommend it.",1217808000,,368,3.670886075949367
7794435,5,0971913404,"This documentary is reminiscent of the American spirit.  These folks existed when punching cows involved skill, talent, and know how.  These folks not only got their full load cycle complete through any weather, they protected their livestock.  Nowadays, city slickers have encroached on ranch lands thereby causing ranches to either sell out or become more 'commercialized'.  Here in a traditional cowpuncher town in Central AZ, we are witnessing the transition of ranch land to rural to suburban to urban.  With every big box store and with every ranch being sold, cowpunchers are seemingly disappearing.  But, every now and again, I meet someone having a whiskey that is wearing a hat with character, boots that have seen a few miles, and a face that can stare down an eagle.  These are my role models and Ranch Album is the very essence of Cowboy.",1183507200,,851,4.950704225352113
7794436,5,0971913404,I have known the Steiger brothers for almost 15 years. My mother and father had lived on the Yolo ranch when they where filming this video. They hit the true meaning of family and comradery among friends and co workers. I lost my father 7 years ago and pull this video out from time to time and view it for the memories. I deeply suggest this video for all childern who think thier lives are hard.,1075507200,,397,4.2368421052631575
