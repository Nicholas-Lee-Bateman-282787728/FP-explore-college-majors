3920567,5,B002EZ94GK,This is a great Randolph Scott feature film. I get as man of his films as I can. This is one of his best. He makes his portrayal of the characters very real.,1379721600,2,157,3.787878787878788
3920568,3,B002EZ94GK,"I ordered this film to see how it could have been in the days of the old Liberal, Ks.  I am from there so when I heard there was a movie made centering Liberal, I was curious.  Of course I knew there wouldn't be anything in it contrasting then and now.  It was just a fun thing to watch.",1375660800,,287,3.830508474576271
3920569,5,B002EZ94GK,"RKO Radio Pictures presents ""TRAIL STREET"" (1947) (84 min/B&W) -- Starring Randolph Scott, Robert Ryan, Anne Jeffreys, George 'Gabby' Hayes & Steve Brodie

Directed by Ray Enright

A Kansas town is without a Marshal and the nearby farmers are unable to grow crops due to the summer drought and trail riders that run cattle over their land. Bat Masterson (Scott) arrives to bring law and order whilst his Deputy (Ryan) accidentally finds a variety of wheat that will withstand the drought. But the farmers are giving up and leaving and Bat must convince them to stay. He wants them to continue farming and also help round up the local gang of outlaws & criminal ranch owners

George ""Gabby"" Hayes outdoes himself with every scene, much like he did in the John Wayne film ""Tall in the Saddle"" (1944) playing Dave the stage driver.

Wonderful B-Western cast with Gabby Hayes, Steve Brodie, Harry Woods, Jason Robards Sr., Ernie Adams, Hank Bell and Harry Harvey.

Robert Ryan as Allen Harper is excellent in this action packed western.

If you're a Randolph Scott fan, this will wet your whistle and satisfy, one not to be missed.

3920570,5,B002EZ94GK,"Randolph Scott was one of the best western characters along with Joel McCrea and others of that time.  I really enjoy these old westerns and mysteries too.  If you like mysteries with a little comic in them, check out the ""Thin Man"" series with Richard Powell and Myrna Loy.  I think there's seven movies of them together.  Great movies.  Enjoy!",1281052800,2,345,4.683333333333334
3920571,5,B002EZ94GK,"Ever since I first saw TRAIL STREET a number of years ago, it has been a favorite, not because it's a ""great"" Western (like RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY or the Boetticher/Scott Westerns of the late '50s), but rather because it has certain ""lyrical"" and delightfully comedic qualities that make it extremely attractive and fun to watch. ""Gabby"" Hayes steals the show, and in the first 15 or 20 minutes repeats some of the funniest lines in any Westerns. His references to his cousin ""Brandyhead"" Jones are hilarious...and also serve as a fitting end of the film. Scott is the usual unperturbed law-enforcer. In addition, a youngish Robert Ryan does well, and let's don't leave out the almost-now-forgotten Anne Jeffreys! She deserves more notice, after all of her many contributions to B- and ""little"" A Westerns. In short, TRAIL STREET packs all the action, all the entertainment, and a goodly dose of comedy that make for a rip-snorting good time. Highly recommended (and it plays well time after time, too!)",1249862400,17,1002,4.93491124260355

8368496,4,B002EZ94GK,"Good serviceable western from Randolph Scott.  Mr. Scott plays Bat Masterson but the filmmakers don't let the facts get in the way of a good story.
Robert Ryan seems to play a bigger part in the story than Randolph Scott and Gabby Hayes is an amusing sidekick.  Anne Jeffreys looks terrific and doesn't disappoint as an old west style entertainer of sorts.

Just my opinion, but I think Mr. Ryan is a better villain than a good guy.  Even so, he shines as always no matter the script or part.

The story isn't that great.  It's a B western after all but it is a lot of fun.  Fans of Randolph Scott and Robert Ryan and good westerns in general should enjoy Trail Street.",1436486400,2,669,4.346774193548387

8368499,4,B002EZ94GK,"Good Randolph Scott western.  Robert Ryan is a supporter of the farmers being run out of business by the cattlemen led by Steve Brodie in Kansas.  Things have gotten out of hand as the cowboys are running the farmers out of their homes at a record pace.  Growing crops are tough enough, but getting them trample by cattle and cowboys is more than they can handle.  George ""Gabby""
Hayes sends out for the most famous lawman around to put an end to end.  The lawman is Bat Masterson, Randolph Scott, comes in to save the day.  Add to it a love triangle with both Robert Ryan and Steve Brodie in love with the local beauty Madge Meredith and a jealous saloon gal, Anne Jeffreys, and you've got a better than average western tale.  Well worth the watch.",1421539200,2,749,4.423357664233577
