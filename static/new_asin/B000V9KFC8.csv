8217596,5,B000V9KFC8,"This movie shows a more realilstic view of Dissociative Identity Disorder which was first known as Multiple Personality Disorder. Knowing someone with this diagnosis and living very close to them, I have to say that this movie is the BEST dramatization that I have seen!!!This subject matter is very close to my heart. We need more movies made about this subject.  We all know about the movie Sybil. That was  an extreme case. Some say the truth conveyed in the movie is debatable. The HBO series united states of Tara, is not a true dramatization or accurate exampleAT ALL. It is Hollywood putting their own flair/spin on the show. Don't get me wrong, I like th series. But for entertainment purposes only. I can definitely relate to some of the switching & characters. Living with multiple personality is not humorous for the most part. This is a very delicate & serious illness! Childhood sexual abuse is alive in socity. Always has, and always will be as long as it is tolerated and ""kept secret"".  I thought that we are a society that is ""open minded""  ""non-judgmental"" society? The long-term affects of any kind of sexual abuse, are just as real. It can be devastating. Hollywood to date, have not brought any ""light"" to the subject. Living with multiple personality is a journey, a struggle, a blessing in disguise (no pun intended), a life of rejection, betrayal, confusion,... must I go on? Really, I have studied MPD for years. I have read & interviewed and counseled women who suffer from this illness. It is an illness that begs for proper education, information, therapy and understanding!!! I personally believe, that Multiple Personality/DID is the new ""coming out"" from being in the closet.  I think it's like the homosexuals of yesteryears. Why is it that MPD is frowned upon, people think you are ""crazy"". Simply NOT TRUE!! Heather Locklear does an outstanding & unforgetable performance! The closest & most accurate portrayal of what it's like for someone to have multiple personality. The medical & psychological field need to create the RESOURCES & make them readily available & affordable toEVERYONE who needs help. Society does not look after enough of those suffering from PTSD. Thousands if not millions of people suffer everyday while going UNDIAGNOSED and UNTREATED. Too many people are being wrongfully diagnosed of having Schizophrenia, Bi-Polar, Depression, etc when they are truly a multiple personality. We know that any trauma to your psyche destroys something within you! We need the expertise in finding exactly what that ""something"" is within a human being that separates them from the non-MPDs! Too often the suffering is ongoing, no relief from ALL the symptoms of having PTSD & only being treated for SOME of the symptoms that mimic the other depressive & debilitating illnesses mentioned. Remember years ago homosexuality/being gay, was something you hid & never told anyone. The world got educated, informed, peopkle were counseled and discovered that being gay did not mean that they were CRAZY! Another diagnosis of yesteryear was epilepsy. So many people suffered needlessly and were accused of being crazy. They were ""put away"". Another example of needless ruined lives! Sad but true, we are still in the dark ages when it comes to psychological disorders! I loved this movie! You will too. This movie will hopefully bring compassion & an awareness of this very real illnes, or will it not? You be the judge. V. Roy",1332720000,3,3460,5.0
8217597,5,B000V9KFC8,"Every now and again a TV movie comes along and surprises the viewer with its excellent casting and writing; ""The Terror Inside"" falls into that category. Heather Locklear stars in this forgotten telefilm about a woman who suffers from alternate personality disorder, in which she takes on the personalities of multiple people. As the film progresses the reasons this woman suffers from this mental disorder are fully and graphically depicted. The movie is widely known for the graphic sex scene between the Locklear character and a man in a van. It was surprising the network censors allowed such a scene be broadcast.
 The DVD also stars Brett Cullen as Locklear's husband. The set is a barebones edition.
 I also have to add that Heather's portrayal of a woman who suffers from multiple personality disorder ranks up there with the virtuoso performances of Sally Field in ""Sybil"" and Erika Slezak's as Vicki/Niki on TV's ""One Life to Live"".",1246060800,9,942,4.993630573248407
8217598,5,B000V9KFC8,"Heather Locklear gives one of her best performances in THE TERROR INSIDE. It's a TV film with typical production values, but Locklear is wonderful as a disturbed woman who suffers from alternative personalities due to some dark secrets from her past. Based on a true story. Locklear fans will love this one!",1238371200,9,307,4.923076923076923
