7960880,5,B000065B0G,Armand Assante plays the tough guy role so naturally. The story is good and the acting is great.,1410998400,,96,4.388888888888889
7960881,4,B000065B0G,"Armand Assante, another actor I like a lot.

In this one, he's connected to the mob (telling his job would be a spoiler of sorts), gets screwed by the mob and goes into witness protection.

Where he meets a dissatisfied housewife, with a sister that is in heat most of the time and banging the housewife's husband on the side.

By hook or crook, all parties figure out Armand's mob background and try and cash in.

Comedy and violence ensues.

Pretty gorey at times, Situational violent comedy.

Don't think it would go well with kids, but good acting, decent characters and it delivers a solid / funny / violent (did I mention violent?) experience.",1391472000,,649,4.649122807017544
7960882,4,B000065B0G,"Armand Assante stars in ""Federal Protection"" a  mobster ""hide and seek"" tale.  He plays a very lucky mobster that is put into a suburbia neighborhood to hide from his murderous mob colleagues.  Originally he worked in a auto chop shop, but had to leave when the mob got tough and he had to fight for his life.  Suburbia changes him as he meets the neighbors and finds true love.  ""Federal  Protection"" is action packed and keeps your attention as the neighbors become a big part of the mobster's life.",1287705600,,501,4.573033707865169
7960883,3,B000065B0G,"This is a modern version of the 'film noir' genre popular in the late 1940s Hollywood, mostly lower budget films made to feed the chains of theatres. This was mostly filmed in Canada and has many faces not usually seen in Hollywood films. It reminded me of 'Rififi', that 1950s classic that is all but forgotten. Or blacklisted?

It has the usual collection of ""average"" people who live amoral lives. The husband's adultery with his sister-in-law would be shocking decades ago, but shows like ""Jerry"" flaunt these people everyday in Reality TV. People who are sleazy are tempted to betray a neighbor for a million dollars. ""Those who would sup with the devil should use a long spoon"" goes the saying. Of course something goes wrong; amateurs can't match professionals. The scheming pair pay a higher price than they demanded. The ""hero"" and ""heroine"" survive, but that is needed for a profitable film. People want to believe that some goodness gets some reward. Some people would question the realism of this action story, but ""its only a movie"".

That neighborhood is shown as barren of life, or, it could be the need to rein in production costs. That scene in Chicago was the most expensive and could explain the other sparse scenes.",1138406400,,1235,4.820754716981132
7960884,3,B000065B0G,"A comedy?  Hardly.  This movie has some very good action scenes and an engaging (if predictable) plot.  Overall, the movie is entertaining, but somebody really missed the opportunity for a great ending.  I won't blow it for you by describing how they missed it, but if you do watch this one you'll probably have the same perception -- something is missing at the end, but there's not enough missing to expect a sequel (not to say that they won't cobble one together).",1067904000,,467,4.658536585365853
7960885,3,B000065B0G,"This film isn't much of an action thriller, contrary to what the cover suggests.  There's a lengthy shootout scene at the end, but most of the film is an excessive, violent, aiming-to-be-hip comedy which does draw some good laughs, but ultimately falls short of being a good film.
Dina Meyer all but owns the picture.  She single-handedly drives the action, and she's clearly having a ball with the scheming, none-too-bright character.  She also supplies the film with its best scene, the seductive cat-and-mouse at the police luncheon.  It's precisely this spark that Angela Featherstone lacks -- playing the wounded housewife, Featherstone offers nothing we haven't seen before.  A shame, because she'd started her career in an array of strange roles, most memorable being Dark Angel:  The Ascent -- not the James Cameron TV show, but the Full Moon Pictures gore film.  She's become a token actress with soft eyes and elvish haircut, offering no surprises or star quality.  Armand Assante's role in the picture isn't all that large, frankly, but he does appear more confident than most of the other actors.  Too bad he and Meyer don't really have scenes together; Meyer is a much better actor than Featherstone for Assante to play opposite.
There are some good sight gags -- the golf-club gag, the aforementioned police luncheon -- but some of that is negated by over-the-top violence.  Director Anthony Hickox is at fault -- what did you expect from the director of Hellraiser III?  As he deserves credit for the inventiveness of the comedic routines, so he deserves blame for the excessive gore-as-sight-gag scenes, which are never as funny as they think they are.
Worth a look, but not much more.",1061424000,,1701,4.99645390070922
