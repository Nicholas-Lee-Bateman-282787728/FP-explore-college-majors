7808792,3,6300988635,"The scene where Alexander gets on top of Captain Kirk and starts riding him is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. When I saw it for the first time I about died. I wonder how William Shatner was able to do that without quitting his job. As for the rest, this is an episode that shows ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" It also shows how some people in the world can be walked on. This episode is also ground breaking for the first interracial kiss on television.",1242345600,,474,4.337078651685394
7808793,5,6300988635,"This is the most underappreciated episode of all, in large part because it is at times difficult to watch. A band of humanoids -- the Platonians -- have great telekenetic powers but are in need of a doctor. So, after luring the Enterprise, they humiliate and torture Kirk and Spock in an attempt to convince McCoy to stay. Later they beam down Nurse Chapel and Uhura (for that famous kiss) to join in the entertainment.

The payoff comes in the scenes with the dwarf Alexander, played by the great actor Michael Dunn. Alexander is the only Platonian without ""the power."" He is the court jester, the punchline of every joke, and feels himself inferior to all the other Platonians.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy teach him otherwise. The abuse of power makes one a lesser, not a greater, being. We've heard that said before, but never so movingly. Shatner is at his best here. ""Alexander,"" says Kirk, ""where I come from, size, shape, and color don't matter. And no one has the power.""

Pay attention to the ingenious metaphors and ironies. When Kirk, Spock, and McCoy first beam down, Alexander is seen around the corner where he casts a large shadow and seems at first to be a giant. Then there's the name ""Alexander"" itself, connoting greatness. The irony, of course, is that Alexander really is a bigger man than the small-minded Platonians, despite his small stature. In the end, Kirk triumphs, and Alexander declares to the tyrant, ""Parmen, I could have had the power. But I refused to become like you.""",1181952000,,1499,4.735632183908046
7808794,4,6300988635,"I've got to give the show and its fine crew of writers credit where credit is due, not just for the impact of Kirk and Uhura's kiss (the first interracial kiss in television history) but for their overall message in  this episode.
With the help of the unimaginally indulgent, remorseless  Platonians, they sent across a substantial message in a flash of sparkling  outfits, thick makeup (particularly in poor Chris Chapel's case) and Will  Shatner's staccato and over-the-top acting:
Exploitation is  wrong.
True, this is a lesson we all learned years ago in Kindergarten  with the Golden Rule, but, not surprisingly, in the midst of the guilty  excitement of gossip and the build-'em-up, tear-'em-down philosophy of the  media, we all tend to wander from that message.
The Platonians used Kirk,  Spock, Uhura and Chapel, putting them into humiliating, and what would have  inevitably become fatal, situations purely for their own amusement. One can  find similar parallels in the mass media market today. Indeed we do seem to  receive some sort of pleasure in seeing some of our favorite actors,  writers, personalities, etc. put into embarrasing situations.
Kirk and  the gang, as always, represent the new world of equality, virtue and  harmony throughout, even when consumed with hatred for their capturs.
One  has to wonder just who the Platonians represent.
One Schlocky Note:  Shatner slapping himself silly, cracking the whip, and...well just *being*  in the episode seemed to be one big campfest for him this time.  Congratrulations Bill, you should be proud.",948412800,9,1568,5.2
7808795,1,6300988635,"When the U.S.S. Enterprise receives a distress call from the planet Platonius, Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to the planet's surface. There they find the planet's leader, Parmen, with a badly infected leg. The  Platonians, while powerful psycho kinetics, have no resistance against  physical injury. As Parmen's wife tells them, a cut or break in the skin  can literally cause death. The only resident of Platonius that doesn't have  ""the power"" is Alexander, a dwarf, who is everyone's jester and  slave.  When Parmen's wound has healed and the landing party prepares to  leave, they find the U.S.S. Enterprise's control are frozen. Parmen has  decided that it would be beneficial for them to have a resident doctor and  tries to convince McCoy to remain. When he refuses, Parmen and the others  try to convince him by subjecting Kirk and Spock to several humiliating  scenarios. Still the doctor refuses and the three officers are locked away  to ponder their plight.  After questioning Alexander, McCoy determines that  the Platonians probably got their mental powers from eating the local  foods. Something about Alexander's metabolism has kept him from acquiring  those powers as well. McCoy prepares concentrated doses of kironide, the  substance in the local food, and injects it into Kirk and Spock. Alexander,  given the chance, refuses an injection. He doesn't want the same powers  that his masters have.  As they discuss their next move, the shimmering of  a transporter beam appear in the room and Lt. Uhura and Nurse Chapel  appear. Without a word, they are jerked out of the room, as if controlled  with invisible strings, and disappear. Kirk comments grimly that the men  were apparently not entertaining enough for the Platonians.  Later, Uhura  and Christine join the other officers, dressed in sparkling gowns and  lavish makeup. Christine's is even vaguely Vulcan with slanted eyebrows and  partially covered ears. What follows is a series of ""games""  designed to humiliate the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members and entertain the  Platonians. McCoy, seated in a place of honor beside Parmen, is expected to  accept the leaders offer to stay and serve as their physician.  Kirk and  Spock are forced to fight each other and Spock is made to sing ""Maiden  Wine"" to the two women. Finally, Spock is paired on a loveseat with  Christine, while Kirk shares one with Uhura. They are forced to make  advances on the women. The play gets nasty then, as Kirk and Spock take up  whips, which they snap at their respective partners. By now, however, the  doses of kironide are beginning to take effect and both officers now resist  the Platonians powers and throw down their weapons.  Kirk tells Parmen that  they can recreate this power whenever they want and if the Federation finds  that Parmen and his people have fallen back to their old ways, there will  be trouble. With this, Kirk calls for the U.S.S. Enterprise to beam them  aboard... along with Alexander, who will be coming with them to start a new  life.",943315200,3,3025,4.985943775100401
