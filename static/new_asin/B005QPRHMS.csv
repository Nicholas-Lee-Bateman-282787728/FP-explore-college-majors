4859696,1,B005QPRHMS,"the quality of the picture is horrible.  I bought this product because I like the movie and I have it on VHS.  When I am in the mood to watch this movie again, I will watch the VHS version of it.  The DVD is a transfer from a VHS that is not as good as the one I have.  You can even see the tracking static at the bottom of the picture in several places.  Also, the picture is so dark in some places that you cannot see the details of the picture; i.e. indoor shots.

One other thing that I would not have minded had the DVD been fine...the cover is so amateurish!",1367452800,17,564,3.9035087719298245
4859697,2,B005QPRHMS,"I have been waiting a long time for THE ACCUSED to come out on DVD.  I give the movie itself 4 STARS, but this copy is poor.  An enclosed letter said a refund was possible, but after three emails there is still no reply from the seller.  BEWARE of future copies.",1320451200,14,262,4.098039215686274

8483549,4,B005QPRHMS,"If you've been hesitating about purchasing the DVD
due to the negative reviews about the picture quality,
fear not. Those reviews refer onlly to the DVD-R.

The DVD looks great,
Now you can enjoy this thriller starring Loretta Young,
Robert Cummings and Wendell Corey.

The story deals with some bad choices made by Loretta Young
which change her life forever. She becomes entangled in
a web of her own making with every twist and turn.

There are no extras.",1507334400,4,458,4.772151898734177
8483550,5,B005QPRHMS,Loretta young thoughtfully portrays a psychology professor who is suddenly overtaken by events that threaten her life and career. Her performance is very good- it has a fine and delicate quality like her beauty. The 2016 issue Universal Vault Series copy that I purchased has good picture quality- no problems.,1506124800,,310,5.22

8483552,4,B005QPRHMS,"Very forties (and that ain't bad). Totally watchable and involving, enhanced immeasurably by the actors, particularly Ms. Young and the criminally underrated Wendell Corey.",1498176000,4,172,6.208333333333333
8483553,5,B005QPRHMS,The old movies are the best movies. This one was suspenseful and well acted. The story line was well written. To those who enjoy the good old movies will enjoy this one.,1484092800,4,169,4.3125

8483555,5,B005QPRHMS,Toward the end of her movie career Loretta Young made several movies that called on all of her acting abilities that she had learned since the age of 4. This is one of those movies.,1482796800,4,181,4.2
8483556,4,B005QPRHMS,"The movie is great, a very engaging story and an excellent Loretta Young performance. But this disc is horrible. The tracking is so bad, it gets into the sound. At the very end you aren't sure you're going to make it all the way through. I gave it four stars because I like the movie so much, and if you really want to see it, well I don't think you'll have an easy time finding it anywhere else. But wow is this bad.",1397779200,11,417,4.036144578313253
