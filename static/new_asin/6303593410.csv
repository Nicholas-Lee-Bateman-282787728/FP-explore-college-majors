686427,5,6303593410,"When I looked at this film some years ago I was so amazed at the interplay of male to female, where the male ""visitor"" is trapped back to earth by his female captor/'host'; a sand pit becomes the entirety of both time and the world to these two where the male character at first finds that not only has his feminine counterpart been waiting for him but he cannot leave, his entomological peregrinations find him a captured specimen himself. He struggles to escape back into shallow knowledge when life overpoweringly waits for him to waken to it and take some interest. He does, and it's as if he could not have knew anything about life before that; he tries to escape once more but is caught in a pool of quicksand, the local villagers pull him out and bring him back to the hut at the bottom of the sand pit. He struggles with vanity, even tries to take the woman captive instead but that proves feeble too; life is overpowering to his self-centered view and he succumbs to another world that had up to then been of no interest to him.
  Just the scenes of the male character trying to climb free of the sand pit are worth viewing as another metaphor for self-centered need trying to reach an unattainable goal, finding meaning somewhere that repudiates understanding itself. Taking a makeshift grappling hook and trying to break free has to have some similarity to trying to complete a graduate degree, over and over he tries to pull himself toward some point free of the mundane, stultifying sand. But he finally grows to accept having disappeared somewhere where there's not anything more to do than to shovel falling sand night after endless night; acceptance of something in phenomenology/existentialism called ""facticity"" seems to finally make the predicament more understandable, there's a continuity that becomes more meaningful than the pursuit of a superficial knowledge that he'd had before. Life becomes more involved for somebody who'd actually only had to play everything merely by the numbers before, so the continuity of life had finally re-shaped a character that had only been hovering over it.
  A memorable movie, worth viewing over and over.",1402099200,3,2164,4.856368563685637

686456,3,6303593410,"This film immediately presents the viewer with two basic problems.  First, how to navigate the DVD menu to turn on/off the subtitles (Criterion label DVD menu designers seem to delight in making this a game on release after release).  Second, trying to figure out what this movie is really about.  Is it a protest against modern society in general and Tokyo life styles in particular?  Is it an anti-capitalist tome?  An anti-labor union allegory?  How the conventional wisdom of not digging deeper when in a hole is untrue (especially for sand)?  An anti-prison movie?  A free-the-sand-dune-bugs protest film?  All of the above?  None of the above?  For sure, it is a spider-and-the-web fantasy tale, and a pretty scary one at that.  There are also elements of magic scattered about.  Only  two characters and essentially a single set manage to hold the viewers attention for two hours and change.  This is made possible by A-list actor Eiji Okada and actress Kyoko Kishida.  Its Kishidas low keyed, but riveting performance that particularly maintains the viewers attention.  The film was shot in a narrow-screen format and in black and white at a time when this type of packaging had long been abandoned by almost everyone except art-house film directors.  Camera work uses a lot of deep focus; tracking/panning is occasionally jerky.  Score is sometimes grating; at other times it substantially adds to the sense of terror.  Subtitles are fine and essentially indispensible when marginal characters speak with Western Japan accents.  Restoration is outstanding.  Just sit back, relax, and let the allegories begin!

686459,5,6303593410,"(Review based on the four disc Criterion edition)

There are few directors in the art cinema realm that appeal to everyone. Hiroshi Teshigahara is one of those directors that seems to awe more people than he turns off, yet his films are met with a certain amount of animosity.  Upon release, most of the reviews of these three films were very critical, especially 'The Face of Another' (noted from the special features on disc).  Granted, Woman in the Dunes was Oscar nominated, but it never really stood a chance against Fellini or 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'.

So what makes these films and this collection so amazing?  Well to highlight a bit about the films, these three films are considered the core (along with the fourth in the series, 'The Man Without a Map' - not included in this set) of Teshigahara's works.  The four films were written by novelist Kobo Abe and the music for all four were composed by Toru Takemitsu.  I'll sum up the three included in this set.

Pitfall is an amazing film set in a remote mining area. The scenery is typically remote, barren, and empty.  In fact there is one scene in an abandoned village which is quite striking.  The core cast is small and like most of the Abe/Teshigahara works, there is a side story moving along with the main plot.  In this film the viewer is taken on an existentialist tour of post war Japan.

Woman in the Dunes is probably the most famous of the three films in this set.  The story centers around a man trapped against his will with a woman.  The sand dunes prevent his escape and the local villagers exchange water, food, and supplies for sand from the pit.  This film is much slower and the dialogue much more sparse than the other two films in this collection.

The Face of Another is my personal favorite.  An amazing Tatsuya Nakadai plays a man, scarred and disfigured who attempts to regain some of his old self by wearing a life like mask.  In reality he wants to seduce his wife, whom he suspects is looking to have an affair.  This film reminded me a bit of the later Bergman films in the cinematography and the story.  There are many sociological and psychological questions.  The ending is simply stunning, though a bit forced.

There is an extra disc of features, which are ho hum.  There are several documentaries by Teshigahara, but they are not cleaned up and they are rather specific to certain interests.  I would have enjoyed the Hokusai documentary more (being a huge Ukiyo-e fan), except that it isn't in color (part of the joy of viewing Ukiyo-e is the color).  But the extra conversation and discussion is very welcome.  What is more interesting and appealing is the brief analysis of each film included as a special for each disc.  Though the writer/speaker is well versed in film, he is not the most versed in Japanese society, so he does fail to pick up on a few very Japanese themes.  But his comments are excellent overall.

The transfer is gorgeous, and these three films are deserving of such fine treatment.  The translations are very accurate as to be expected from Criterion.  Really there is no area this set is lacking.  The included booklet gives even more insight into these complex works of art.  So without reservation I highly recommend this collection. These films will often confound the viewer, but they are rewarding over the long run.  I found that subsequent viewings are as enjoyable as the first viewing, and I always notice something I didn't see the first time.  It's as if Kafka, Camus, and Dostoevsky got together and said ""let's make some movies!"".",1371081600,,3572,4.651757188498403
686460,4,6303593410,"It's hard to describe the movie, but we enjoyed it.  We came across it one day on TV but only caught the end of it. So we ordered it.  If you don't like foreign films, it's not for you.",1365292800,,185,3.717948717948718
686461,3,6303593410,While that film kept a foot in reality (and one in the afterlife) this one creates an artificial world that is simply difficult to deal with on any level.  Are many of us symbolically shoveling sand from our minds that blows back in?  Do romantic relationships persist more from necessity than satisfaction?  Are we willing to stay in a less than desirable environment rather than go back and fight the social battles of youth again?  It's all rather bleak.,1364428800,,457,4.746835443037975
686462,5,6303593410,"This is definitely one of the top ten movies ever made.  The plot is captivating and the sand dunes scenery is mesmerizing.  The music is haunting and heightens the effect.  The movie also manages to be highly erotic without any pornographic elements.  Yes the technical quality is not that good but the film itself more than makes up for it.

The basic plot is of a businessman from Tokyo visiting sand dunes to pursue his hobby of collecting insects and getting imprisoned in a sand pit with a widowed village woman.  Ironically by rural Japanese standards she at thirty-something is an ""old"" woman but definitely attractive.  The main story starts with a polite dinner with the widow.  Nevertheless the initial attraction he would feel towards her is subsumed by the governing situation that he is there just for one night after being stranded in the area.

Next morning he discovers that the villagers have tricked him into staying in the sand pit where he cannot escape because they control the rope ladder from above which is his only means of exit.  He now must help her mine the sand which the villagers collect by a pulley and then sell.  The situation changes completely as he is enraged at her for being in on the trap but she had as little control as he did.

Eventually he realizes that he cannot escape and starts feeling an attraction for her.  She is a simple country woman without any makeup but with a pretty face and pretty eyes.  It soon turns out that she seems more interested in sex and the inevitable happens.  This of course gives them relief from their situation since she is trapped by the villagers just as much as he is.

Later he starts to realize that he likes this life more than his bureaucratic job in Tokyo.  It has more meaning because he is constantly challenged with surviving in a bleak environment.

The only problems I have with this film are the many close up shots of things like sand grains and insects.  These are suddenly pictured without zooming in and I would edit them out.  Also there is a scene where the villagers suddenly appear in weird masks and costumes.  It seems that this is some sort of surreal scene but it probably resulted from one of those medieval ceremonies that the Japanese were re-enacting and then suddenly showed up at the pit.

A number of reviewers have gone out of their way to show their political correctness by portraying the film as some form of unwarranted male dominance.  But this story is no different than the age-old story of a man who is seduced and trapped by a woman.  The difference here is that the sand dune makes it all happen.  There is also the theme that a man trapping insects ends up being trapped himself.  But the main story here is the relationship with the woman.",1362787200,,2763,4.576374745417516

686516,5,6303593410,"This film readily entered my top 10 list, among the most brilliant, insightful and unsettling films I've ever seen.  It progresses on 3 levels:
First the psychological.....the natural human fear of entrapment, a base and visceral reaction to a Stephen King type scenario.  Then an expansion into the psycho-sexual (far over-played in the marketing of this film.)  Finally, encompassing all of life, an existential observation regarding all human endeavor and meaning.  Revelations dawn on the viewer so slowly one might take them as intimately personal, testimony to the ingenious subtlety of direction.

686519,3,6303593410,"For a classic movie, WOMAN IN THE DUNES has so many flaws which vitiate the intention of the filmmaker that it would have to be called ""a lousy classic movie.""

The premise is that an entomologist, looking for a place to stay in an area full of sand dunes by the ocean, is lowered into a house occupied by a woman who has lost her husband and child. The villagers withdraw the rope ladder so that the entomologist can't escape. The purpose of the story is to show that the entomologist eventually accepts his Sisyphian fate, i.e. living the rest of his life covered with sand and filling buckets of sand for the villagers to sell at a nearby market.

But the premise is soon sabotaged by events in the plot that confuse and contradict the intention.

For example, the entomologist makes a rope ladder out of a fishing seine, and successfully climbs out of the dune. Absurdly he gets caught in quicksand, the villagers rescue him and lower him back down into the dune. So the dune is not so Sisyphian after all. You can get out, using ingenuity. But the man doesn't try it again.

Then he asks the villagers to let him out of the dune long enough to see the ocean. They agree, on the condition that a crowd of villagers looking down into the pit watch him and his wife copulate. A very dramatic scene which again weakens the overall point of the movie. ""Sure, you can get out if you let us watch you make love to your wife.""

Then the woman gets pregnant. The villagers lower the ladder to get her to a doctor, but the man does not seize this opportunity to escape. (Bear in mind that the idea of escape has never left his mind since he was first trapped in the dune.)

Finally, he invents a well to extract water from the sand by capillary action. He is so proud of his well that he wants to tell people about it.

""Well,"" he says, ""I'll stay for another year, then I'll tell them."" This is his capitulation to his fate. But by this time we have become skeptical of the whole premise of the story. It is possible to get out. He wants to get out. He has the means to get out. But he stays because his wife is pregnant and he is proud of his well.

All the brilliant cinematography, the macabre claustrated setting, the existential sense of Man as a prisoner in an absurd world he can't escape, condemned to the absurd vocation of shoveling sand forever (viz. NO EXIT by Sartre) (viz. THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS, which is about Sisyphus pushing a stone up a hill, only to see the stone roll down again and again -- surely this was in the director's mind), all of this is compromised by the constant repetition of the fact that you can get out if you want to.

Not a very good movie. Too confused in the execution. It's two and a half hours long, so prepared to be both bored and annoyed.",1326844800,,2779,4.288167938931298

686522,1,6303593410,"This was a very unusual story by an author with a clever imagination. The story basically is of a woman that lives in a sand dune with a house that continually fills with the shifting sand. An unfortunate school teacher that is a collector of bugs for his class stumbles upon three men who tell him he missed his bus and that he can stay with her.  The poor man must climb down a rope ladder to get to her house, and he is held captive and must help her each day shovel up the sand which is pulled up each day by a block and tackle by the three strangers.  It is a test of the human spirit. First he struggles each day to climb the dune only to have the sand collapse , then the resignation of not making an attempt to excape.  In the final end, he is rescued. There is a dramatic love scene that is more of need than of love. I purchased a used V.C.R. tape which was not a good one, and had been nearly worn out. I'm not sure if it comes on a D.V.D.  The tape was so worn that there were hundreds of white flash spots.  Not fun to watch.  However the story in black and white and the scenes of never ending sand, of the ingenuity of living with it is riviting.  I highly advise buying the D.V.D. if available.",1301270400,,1210,3.995850622406639
686523,3,6303593410,"While there is sex involved there is no eros, whatsoever. Desperation, yes, but no eros. Then there is an odd critical claim that Niki has a wife, portrayed by Hiroko Ito. But this is simply not true. Yes, there are several shots of a second woman's body and face seen in the sand, but in no way does Niki nor the film indicate that this is a wife of his. Perhaps this is an imbuement because the character in the book mentions a wife, but, nonetheless, there is no such correlation in the film. Yet another mis-take on the film occurs when Niki almost succumbs to the taunts of the villagers to rape the widow, as they voyeur them. Some critics have claimed that this scene represents Niki's passage into the demented world of the villagers, almost like the scenes near the end of Tod Browning's Freaks, wherein the freaks claim new members by chanting, `One of us.' But, there is no truth to this, as Niki is repulsed by his degradation. And the fact that they do not treat him any differently, after the fact, is proof that this claim is wrong. It is just a perverse sense of torture. Nothing more, nothing less. The villagers may, indeed represent Japanese society, humanity, or a variety of individual groups who are under the film's scrutiny, but this scene does nothing but show them in a horrid, fascistic light. Their perversity, however, clearly influenced scenes in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.

  And this reality connects the film to that masterpiece of another medium, one which aired just a few years later, the British television drama, starring Patrick McGoohan: The Prisoner. Parallels between the plights of the two male protagonists abound. Both are trapped in circumstances, held by unknown forces in a `village,' forced to go along with the villagers' perverse mind games, thwarted in their increasingly desperate ploys to regain control of their lives and bodies, etc. The difference is that, in the end, Niki submits to his tormentors, who are external in nature. By contrast, No. 6 defeats his foes, and we learn that they are, and always have been, internal.

  The DVD package, from The Criterion Collection, Three Films By Hiroshi Teshigahara, comes with a fourth disk of supplements, the main feature of which is a documentary about Teshigahara and his Kobo Abe's lives and collaborations. There are also four short early documentaries by Teshigahara, none of which presage his fictive films. They are: Hokusai, Ikebana, Tokyo 1958, and Ako. The actual disk with Pitfall on it contains the theatrical trailer and a video essay by film critic James Quandt on it. One of the more interesting nuggets gleaned from it is that the bulk of the film was shot in sand dunes close to Mount Fuji. This is quite interesting since the dunes clearly look Saharan, as opposed to other desert's sand formations. Overall, it is a solid video package- with a few early blemishes, shown in a 1.37:1 aspect ratio, although the lack of an English language dubbed track would have been a great help because the white subtitles blanche out against many of the ultra-white shots of the film. The booklet features a career overview by Peter Grilli, an interview with the director, and essays on the films.

  Woman In The Dunes is not only the best of the three films in this DVD set (oddly, a fact most critics agree upon), but also the most Absurdist. Yet, I do not think there is a causal connection between those facts, for there is a good deal of realism, as well. This is shown in many of the scenes where Niki is trying to devise escape plans. In his scientific zeal to catalog his experience, his sense of inventiveness mirrors that of the titular character in another 1964 film, Robinson Crusoe On Mars. It also continues the theme of the corruption of big business and unionism that was at the material core of Teshigahara's own Pitfall. It is the work of a master artist at the height of his powers, despite the minor contrivances the film takes on and asks its viewers to forgive. And viewers should forgive it, for that is its only `flaw,' if one can call it such. And, for that solecism one gets a hefty reward of emotional and intellectual satisfaction from this almost two and a half hour long film that, despite its simple setup and spare cast list, barely feels like it runs for an hour. That's how engrossing its conception and execution is. That sort of service to the film going public deserves- no, demands, reciprocation. Go. Do it.",1283299200,,4465,4.721437740693196

686574,5,6303593410,"The first film, Woman in the Dunes, is a beautiful example of cinematography. Just in the opening scenes with the entomologist walking on the beach was like seeing a painting brought to life. You quickly forget that's its filmed in black and white and you get lost in how the shots are set up and cut. It looked to me like a painting hanging in a modern musuem with a button on the side. After pushing the button the painting starts to move and breath.
Woman in the Dunes is truly stunning with a pleasing aesthetic style brought in by Teshigahara to a deep cerebral quality in the story from Abe's influence. When you blend these two qualities together, you get a film for your artistic sensbilities and your mind. I haven't seen such a even mix until seeing this movie. I can't think of too many films, Japanese or otherwise, that can create it.
Not a lot of time or money went into it. Each actor had to work hard to make it work. Usually in films you have a director who ignores the writer during the filming. Not so here. Teshigahara and Abe worked as close together as a married couple. That gives the viewer something that transcends budgets and clockwatching and takes your own a journey into the writer's and director's mind to create a single vision.
Pitfall is about a miner who is murdered and roams the earth. He can see and understand the living but can't interact. He can only talk with the other dead people walking around. Its not as powerful as Woman in the Dunes, but it has similar themes.
The next film is The Face of Another about a man with a badly burned face. His wife refuses to sleep with him so he decides to buy a mask, in order to seduce her. This movie continues Abe's question of the loss of identity.
This is a great set for a low price from Criterion. You get 4 discs. You get 3 movies, Pitfall, Woman in the Dunes, and The Face of Another. The 4th disc contains an interesting documentary on how director Teshigahara worked with novelist Abe Kobo to bring Abe's unique vision to life. There are thoughtful interviews with John Nathan (author of the Mishima Yukio biography), Sato Tadao (revered Japanese film critc), and Donald Richie, as well as others.
Also on the 4th disc is Tokyo 1958 which I watched first. After reading The Donald Richie Reader and reading in the back that Richie plays a G.I. in that short film, I had to see it. At the very beginning you see Richie looking at Ukiyo-e to buy on a Tokyo sidewalk. Its a rare comedic performance from Richie. The rest of the short shows marriages, camera production, an amature singing contest, and go-go dancers at some night club back in the swinging sixties.
Buy this for Woman in the Dunes and all the extras, even if you don't like the other two films, its worth it for that one film alone, even for $50 to $60.",1236816000,2,2808,4.422779922779923

Three intelligent and sensitive men, one, Toru Takemitsu, who I met and talked with in Paris during the early l970's.  This box set comes with the three films, a documentary 'Teshigara and Abe' and a booklet witten on the movies themselves and those involved in making what one might call avant garde in many ways for that time with what they appear to say holding true for today. The 60-70's where turbulent times in France and Japan even if not overtly shown, feelings would come out on the skin like film, a sore that would not go away.  Why are you doing what you are doing...and is not this what you are doing?  The three films put these questions in a novel interesting format and are completely relevant for today.  One is not taking a chance obtaining this box set, they may well be challenged but that never hurt anyone.....only when enough people get together with the same feelings and thoughts as those who made these films, only then might something take place.  But the films show how easily and dangerous complacency and repetion with reward on a Pavlovian scale can become.....so beware but not afraid..look and listen with all senses wide open = learn.

I originally bought the set because I have had such a hard time finding ""The Woman in the Dunes"".  I was equally stunned by the other two films in the set.  Anyone studying the history of film would enjoy this collection.  They also seem to be the progenitors of many modern films and television (Twilight Zone)dealing with the themes of identity and isolation or media having a strong visual impact.  These films ""Pitfall"" and ""The Face of Another"" are not typically Japanese.  They are a hybrid, being highly influenced by French and Italian cinema of the 30's - 60's.  Even if one finds the surrealistic and dark themes a bit tedious, one can still sit back and enjoy the exquisite cinematography and perfect compositions throughout all three films.  Anime fans will also derive pleasure and inspiration.  ""Woman in the Dunes"" is still my favorite and belongs next to other Japanese classics such as ""Ugetsu"" and ""Rashomon"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" among others.  The extra features includes good commentaries and additional shorts by Teshigahara, as well as a companion book.  Worth the bucks.",1199145600,5,1220,4.960591133004926

If you hate learning and thinking this is not the film for you. The target audience is not your regular Joe that cannot get enough Hollywood films like 300. There exists a heaven beyond Hollywood death and the garbage they put out, and a big part of it is the Criterion Collection.

This is the first time i have watched Teshigahara. I have seen Bergman, Felini, Kurosawa, Kieslowki, Tarkovsky, etc., and Teshigahara is no doubt just as good. It is hard for his later works to compete with Woman in the dunes, and it is visible why; but i like The face of another just as much, and it gets better each time you watch it again. I love Tatsuya Nakadai in anything he does - Sword of Doom, Harkiri to mention a few. Eiji Okada does a great job, and if you liked Hiroshima Mon Amour watch this as well. Finally, it is nice to see more Japaneses actresses.  Machiko Ky, from Rashamon, and Kyko Kishida is the Woman in Dunes.

686579,3,6303593410,"I watched Woman In The Dunes recently for the reason, I suppose, most nowadays would watch Woman In The Dunes - I was told I'm supposed to.  As someone who loves an old, influential movie, I never pass up a chance to see where cinematic tropes began and what modern work has been influenced by a great old movie - if not, simply, to see a great old movie.  Woman In The Dunes, Hiroshi Teshigahara's most famous movie, is visually arresting - its endless fields of sand are the stuff of intense textural specificity, and the shots that are framed around the curves of bodies, naked or clothed, follow that same specificity and exploit for erotic power.  I do think, though, that the movie gets impossible to watch in one sitting - a movie that is supposed to make you feel empathy for a person trapped in an endless situation should not, too, make you feel trapped in an endless situation, and Woman In The Dunes does.  In an extraordinary essay on the film, Roger Ebert describes it as ""a modern version of the myth of Sisyphus,"" and the points he raised are truly twice as fascinating as the movie (read it sometime in his Great Movies section).  Yet it strikes me that movies of similar philosophical ilk do not have to be this deadening - a movie like, say, Roman Polanski's Repulsion used its glacial pace to unnerve you, to deprive you of your ability to tell one second apart from an hour, and it uses that deprivation to address victorian fears of sexuality and changing morals.  Each narrative Herzog movie speaks to his larger theme of man shown as quixotic in the face of the nature man claims dominion over, and slow as his movies are, they allow you to engage in the same sense of unnerved dislocation as their central characters.  I don't think Woman In The Dunes does that - it creates a true sense of place, and certainly makes you feel stuck there, but does not connect to any sense of philosophical speculation - it makes you, truly, hope for an ending.  I'm glad this movie exists, and I'm glad the rerelease features Teshigahari's earlier short works, and I'm truthfully glad I saw it.  But I will never never watch it again, and would be shocked to hear someone who felt excited about this movie.",1192752000,3,2216,4.52

686582,4,6303593410,"Filmmaker Hiroshi Teshigahara was a true artiste who saw film as one of several creative outlets, which is why the sum of his cinematic output feels relatively paltry compared to his contemporaries. The Criterion Collection has smartly seen fit to present a four-disc DVD set showcasing his three most accomplished works - plus four shorts and a feature-length documentary about Teshigahara and his most frequent collaborator, author/screenwriter Kb Abe. Teshigahara's style can best be described as avant-garde, especially compared to the previous generation of Japanese filmmakers who focused far more on narrative structure and emotional consistency - Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Ozu. As judged by these works, Teshigahara seems far interested more in challenging a viewer's sensibilities with movies that confound as much as they resonate. The results were not always successful, but they are well worth experiencing.

The first film of the set, 1962's ""Pitfall"" (****), represents Teshigahara's debut as a feature filmmaker and is both an expressionistic ghost story and a scathing social critique of Japan's post-WWII labor conditions within the mining industry. The mystery-laden plot focuses on a poor coal miner, who is murdered in front of his young son after moving to a ghost town where the local mine becomes a battleground between the two unions that run it. The miner's ghost attempts to solve the crime and figure out the motive, all the while as mistrust permeates the community with more deaths occurring. The filmmaker's social agenda sometimes gets in the way of a corking detective story, but he also presents a haunting, often surreal allegory of social alienation and moral bankruptcy. Hisashi Igawa lends a palpable desperation to the doomed miner, while Kunie Tanaka cuts an appropriately austere figure as the unavoidable stranger in the white suit.

An international art house hit that even garnered Oscar nominations, 1964's ""Woman in the Dunes"" (*****) is the set's centerpiece and a deserving masterpiece. The highly symbolic story focuses on an amateur entomologist on what he thinks is a day trip from Tokyo to a seaside area with vast sand dunes. As he looks for a particular beetle that he thinks will bring him fame within scientific circles, he loses track of time, and local villagers come upon him. For overnight lodging, they take him to a woman who lives in the bottom of a sand pit reachable only by a rope ladder. With the ladder gone the next morning, it dawns on him that he is being held captive by the villagers. From this revelation, Teshigahara and Abe focus on how the man deals with the situation and his evolving feelings toward the woman. Eiji Okada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hiroshima-Mon-Amour/dp/B000093NR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hiroshima Mon Amour</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ugly-American/dp/B00009AOBP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ugly American</a>) dominates every scene as the emotionally volatile entomologist evolving from sexist entitlement to humiliating desperation to serene resignation. As the woman, the offbeat-looking Kyko Kishida initially seems to be playing Friday to Okada's Robinson Crusoe, but her character starts to reveal layers that startle and fill in necessary plot details. The film's overall unnerving tone makes it feel often like an extended episode of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Zone/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Zone</a>.

The third film presented is 1967's ""The Face of Another"" (***1/2), which provides some unsettling sci-fi elements in its piercing exploration of identity, personal freedom and social acceptance. It's probably the most audacious of the three films, but Teshigahara's overly stylized approach makes it arguably the least satisfying on an emotional level. That's because the primary characters feel somewhat removed from reality starting with an embittered burn victim named Okuyama, his face completely bandaged. He has an oddly co-dependent relationship with his psychiatrist, who gives him a prosthetic mask that allows him to start his life anew. However, Okuyama's emotionally isolated wife returns into his life, and the inevitable complications occur. Meanwhile, there is a parallel story centered on a young woman who bears a large radiation burn on her face, a victim of the atomic bomb dropped in Nagasaki. Her wish is to conform wither surroundings and be accepted, which makes for an intriguing counterpoint to Okuyama's plight. Tatsuya Nakadai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harakiri/dp/B0009WIE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harakiri</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B000BB14YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-a-Woman-Ascends-the-Stairs/dp/B000KRNGNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When a Woman Ascends the Stairs</a>) plays the challenging role of Okuyama with effective menace and melancholy, and as his wife, the legendary Machiko Ky (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ugetsu/dp/B000BB14I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ugetsu</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Floating-Weeds/dp/B0001GH5RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Floating Weeds</a>) lends an elegant but tangible sense of concealment to her relatively few scenes.

Each film benefits greatly from Tru Takemitsu's mood-setting music impressive for the versatility he displays with each score. Although extras are modest, each DVD has the original trailer and a generally illuminating if sometimes overly verbose video essay by James Quandt, who heads the Ontario Cinematheque. The fourth disc contains ""Teshigahara and Abe"", an intriguing documentary that covers the filmmaker's eclectic life, including his years being groomed to take over his father's world-renowned ikebana (flower arrangement) school. The four relatively modest shorts provide variable interest to aficionados - 1953's ""Hokusai"" spotlights the famous block artist; 1956's ""Ikebana"", a color film which shows the hard-earned artistry found in his father's school; 1958's ""Tokyo 1958"", an odd curio designed to show the vibrancy of the city at the time; and 1965's ""Ako"", a simple short about a girl's night on the town.

As the woman, the offbeat-looking Kyko Kishida initially seems to be playing Friday to Okada's Robinson Crusoe, but her character starts to reveal layers that startle and fill in necessary plot details.

686605,5,6303593410,"Great job Criterion in releasing the work of a brilliant director. Have seen Woman in the Dunes and Face of Another; both are based on novels by surreal Japanese writer Kobe Abe. Both are Kafkaesque stories of identity
and loss of identity as well as modern man's function in a society where
the self is disappearing. They are both clinical in their dissection of their characters but at the same time dream-like, moody, paranoid, and nightmarish with a touch of the macabre. Face of Another may be a bit less
accessible but both are very deep psychological meditations, brilliant in their simplicity and style. Teshigahara was a true original, at once a part of the japanese New Wave yet somehow distinct from it. He reminds me a bit of Czech director Jan Nemec. This collection is a welcome addition to Criterion's impressive releases. Hopefully ""The Ruined Map"" which is a slightly later Teshigahara film again based on a Kobe Abe novel will be released at some point, but these three films are more than adequate to familiarize people with an extremely important Director.",1183939200,16,1076,4.885245901639344

Also the movie helped me really understand more of what the book was trying to say.
For example, take the house in the pit.  Let us say that it is a metaphor for life.  We're going along, working, sleeping, eating, wondering if we have any meaning in what we do?
The male character, the Guest, complains about the conditions, the work that never ends, the feeling he is nothing.  He refuses to face his problems and tries to escape.  Is that suicide?
The woman is always trying to find something to do, something to lighten the load, something to make them happy.  Even if it is the little things.  Is she optimist?  She does not wish to leave the pit but in the end death comes for us all.
In the movie, the ending is slightly more optimist, as it shows the Guest deciding he can stay, a tad longer.  He has found out a way to make the lifes of the other people in the other houses easier and wishes to pass it on before leaving.
There is nudity and sex, but done in a manner that is tasteful and purely for the story.  123 minutes long, subtitled, in Black & White.",1181865600,3,1324,4.12890625

686609,5,6303593410,"This great classic film, directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara, and scripted by Kobe Abe, from his excellent novel, is a cinematic delight and must have for your cinema collection. The film begins with an entomologist (Eiji Okada) who is studying and collecting  insects at the dunes of an oceanside village. As he begins his journey back to to Tokyo, he misses his bus. Since this was the last bus back, he finds himself stranded. However, the local villagers decide to put him up for the night with 'Granny' (Kyoko Kishida), who is a thirty-something-year-old woman who lives at the bottom of a sand pit. The next morning, when the young man decides to leave, he finds the ladder to the bottom of the pit removed. The film then proceeds to show his attempts at escaping this pit. As the viewer, you realize that his attempts at escape are only half-hearted, and even when the opportunity and chance allows him to leave,[later in the film] he does not.

The rope ladder he must climb up and down, when he attempts to leave, was removed by the villagers [who receive sand used in cement making from the women in the pit]. Realizing that he is going to be a prisoner of the pit until the rope ladder is sent back down the pit, he finds ways of escape. Finally, one day when the entomologist discovers there is fresh water beneath the sand, he sees this as his chance to escape. However, he does not. He decides to stay and figure out how the local people can use the water to aid the villagers of this remote village. Moreover, he wants to understand this woman in the pit, and her suffering. This film will remind  many viewers of Kafka, with Taoism and Zen thrown into the mix. This is a very deep and profound film. One of the truly great films of Japanese cinema. It is highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]",1166486400,7,1798,4.50920245398773

He's taken to the house of a woman (Kyoko Kishida) who lives at the bottom of a sand pit (he has to climb down a rope ladder to get to it); by the next morning he realizes he's going to be held prisoner there (the villagers have removed the ladder). Kishida spends most of her time shoveling sand into buckets that the villagers haul up and sell for use in low-grade cement. She seems happily resigned to her fate, but Okada can only think of escape.

One day he discovers there is fresh water beneath the sand. When he finally sees a chance to escape, he changes his mind at the last minute and decides to stay and try to figure out a way to use the water to aid the village. The movie is almost like a folktale, told simply and with universal motifs. It's all about self-sacricing for a bigger cause (the community), a theme that is especially resonant in Japan. Because of the harrowing living conditions Kishida and Okada live in, their falling in love despite that, and the agonies Okada goes through as he struggles with his individuality and ""higher"" responsibilities, the experience of viewing the picture is very powerful.

What can be more wonderful than being imprisoned in a sand pit with a beautiful woman, suffering the heat and the sand, living a simple life and then... what a joy of escape. And once you are free... you want to go back... Reminds me a little be of a life of a criminal who's been in and out of prison most of his life. But the man is not a criminal, he is a photographer, a harmless hunter for images. What a joy of escape, but... Be it a prison, a mandatory military service or a sand pit like this. It's always about what you want to do and what they want you to do. This movie has a soul, a deep soul. It made me change the way I live life, the way I think and the way I look at life. The book, of course, had a deeper impact on me, but I just had to see the movie. All 5 stars goes for the movie, not necessarily the technical quality of it.",1122076800,5,1021,3.8666666666666667

Except that I take it for what it is; months and months stuck in a sand pit. Some metaphors aren't meant to be; neither simile, metaphor, analogy, or like anything else, its just about a naked lady in the sand, which is what I thought when I saw it when I was a kid.

686668,5,6303593410,"""Woman in the Dunes"" (aka Suna no onna) is the great 1964 film by Hiroshi Teshigahara and for those who think an old Japanese black and white film would be boring, I urge you to see it.  On one level the film has the feel of a Japanese version of a Twilight Zone episode or that of 1962's ""Carnival of Souls"".  It begins slowly with the man on the beach missing the bus and intending to stay just one night with an attractive widow in her hut.  He aoon finds there is no way out of the sand dunes and the otherworldly atmosphere pervading the darkly lit scenes reveals a true cinematographic artistry of shadow and light.

  The two souls male and female inevitable come together in this new universe of sand.  At first the man's main goal is to escape, but as the days, weeks, months, and years go by he accepts his new world.  The villagers lower down cigarettes, wine, and other rations, though there is a water shortage.  He invents a new water distiller though, and is proud of his accomplishment.  So instead of escaping to the outside world, he ends up finding escape FROM it.

  A true artist's sensibility within a simple plot, but one that will force you to keep watching.  Nominated for two foreign film Academy Awards in the days (1964) when art films could actually win.",1110931200,2,1283,4.450643776824034

686670,5,6303593410,"In Japan,this film is titled SUNA NO ONNA. In 1964, the movie won the Grand Jury prize at Cannes, and it was nominated for two Oscars. It was directed by the multi-talented Hiroshi Teshigahara, who as well as a film director, was a poet, calligrapher, a wood block artist, had worked with ceramics, and had directed opera. It was based on a novel by Kobe Abe. The themes prevelant in the film leap from Zen parable to existential horror and Noh drama. It is reminiscent of stories by Franz Kafka, like METAMORPHOSIS.

The cinematographer was Hiroshi Segawa, and he played with light and shadow like a painter, finding a perfectly balanced blend between Abe's prose and Teshigahara's vision. He helped Sand become the third major character in the film, giving it personality, creating a Dali-esque canvas. He photographed sand as if it were a breathing beast, with wind rippling over the white dunes spreading the sand like waves of water, flapping the edges like it was moving silk. And he utilized a lot of extreme close-ups of skin pores choked with grains of sand, and sweaty strands of hair with sand granules clinging to them.

Toru Takemitsu did the music. The score was minimalist, yet powerful and staccato, piercing through us with flute, drum, and strings. The music only materialized when it was needed and necessary. Most of the film was not underscored with music. We heard breathing, moaning, rolling waves, shoveling, the crackling of fire, the bubbling of water, soap on skin, and the terrible creaking of old wood as that house swayed beneath the steady onslaught of the sand.

An essay written by Albert Camlus on the Myth of Sisyphus influenced the plot; that if a person is forced to exercise their entire being toward nothing, accomplishing nothing, mired in repetition, the human spirit is still not vanquishable. It will find joy in the task. Camus wrote,""happiness and the absurd are twin sons of the same earth; inseparable.""  Sisyphus achieved an emotional victory after he learned to love the rock he was pushing repeatedly up the mountainside. Our protagonists achieved a kind of emotional victory when their labor became sacred and necessary.

Eiji Okada played Niki Jumpei, a stranger wandering the dunes searching for insects; especially one rare beetle. Missing the last bus back to Tokyo, he approached some villagers and requested local accommodations. They agreed, and let him stay the night in a house at the bottom of one of their great sand pits. This was a village that the sand had attempted to devour, comprised of a honeycomb of pits dotted across the shoreline, mostly devoured by the shifting sands; only the occasional rooftop protruding out of the darkness of the many pits.

His hostess, played by Kyoko Kishida, was a thirty-something woman, widowed by the sand, and determined to stay the course, to remain in her domicle. She had to shovel the windblown sand constantly to deny the elements the chance to bury her alive. The following morning the man finds that the rope ladder he descended on was missing. He was trapped. Obviously the villagers were in on the conspiracy. Trapped there he lost his freedom, but in its place he found purpose, and with purpose he found meaning, and with meaning he found a strange joy; something he had never known.

This is a stunning film, perfectly in balance; blending poetry, literature, calligraphy, cinematography, and music. It is what all good movies aspire to be-- it is art. It a true classic, almost without flaw. I saw this film three decades ago, and as a twenty-something youth, during my University days, I was not fully appreciative of the subtleties within the piece. It is a timeless parable of the human condition, a film that begs for more than one viewing. The photography haunted me, and the eroticism, and the existential terror stayed with me. It made me hunger to read the novel.",1094083200,29,3889,4.892261001517451
686671,4,6303593410,"This highly unusual film, in Japanese, with English subtitles, features a man and woman, trapped in a dune, forced to shovel sand and their complex relationship.  Although not for everyone, it does have some surpising elements to it.  Violence, lust, sex (though limited by today's standards, and even a little nudity, mostly the male; though some shots of the woman, but as I say, it was 1964) [there was one scene, which I found in a movie book, isn't shown, or at least I didn't see it in the movie, unless it was an outtake, or was quickly shot; showing the woman's face and one breast, I'd have to check, but it wasn't essential to the story.]  Anyway, he tries to escape, but it's the woman who leaves, though he does too (finally).

686672,5,6303593410,"In its basic form, this movie focuses on the unimportance of culture. There is a village so encroached by sanddunes that each house is located at the bottom of a 30 feet deep pit of sand with steep walls. As the ever creeping sand falls into the pits, villager spend more and more time shoveling this sand out or else have there homes buried in it.  Into this strange world wanders a man with no life.  His soul is so empty that his only sustenance is his wild fantasy of discovering a new species of beetle and thereby become fames.  The villagers play matchmaker and put him in a pit with a beatiful but lonely woman who has lost both husband and son to the sand some years back.  At first, the man resents his entrapment and tries to escape but gradually he becomes fond of the woman possibly even to love her.  when a chance to escape finally appears, he choses to stay with the woman in the pit rather than go back to a numbing life in Tokyo.
  In real life, there are people whos life are affected by sanddunes. Although their homes are kept above the dunes, the wells that provide water cannot be raised so they have to keep digging out the sand and build walls around the well to try to stop the moving dunes from covering their life giving water. They wage a relentless war agains the sand - Not such a fantasy after all. I highly recomend this DVD to everyone.",1065052800,2,1370,4.286821705426356
686673,5,6303593410,"When I first saw this movie a number of years ago it made a tremendous impression. I had walked in ""cold"" into an LA art theatre and had no idea what I was watching and what to expect. But I soon found myself mesmerized as if under the spell of the Ancient Mariner - it still retains some of this power today.
The plot of this movie has been fairly well summarized by several reviewers. For completeness, I give a thumbnail sketch: A youngish man for the city (Tokyo) goes to a desolate part of the countryside to collect insects (his hobby). He overstays, and misses the last bus back. The local villagers decide to put him up with ""Granny"" - who turns out to be thirtyish, not-unattractive woman, who ominously lives at the bottom of a sand pit. The next morning the man finds the ladder removed, and himself trapped in the sand pit. Much of the movie portrays his half-hearted attempts to escape, and his tempestuous relationship with his woman ""jailor."" Near the end of the movie he is given a clear and easy chance to escape, but decides to ""postpone"" his departure.
This film is an adaptation of the novel by the same name by the Japanese writer, Kobo Abe. A major and fascinating writer, Abe shares stylistic affinities with Dostoyevsky and (especially) Camus. Alienation and loss of identity are prominent Abe motifs (as they are with Camus). The movie was made in Japan; so unlike many Hollywood films, it is fairly faithful to the novel. For stylistic reasons, it was made in black and white: shadows are an essential element in the mood.
An extreme reductionist view of the film/novel might go something like this: The movie explores the eternal dance by which man and woman accommodate themselves to each other. The woman's need for security, stability, and social respectability often conflict with the man's need for freedom, new experiences, and impractical dreams. Gradually, through a largely unconscious process, the two make those small adjustments which allow for a log-term - if somewhat uneasy - alliance.
A secondary theme is the corrosive effects of time. Or more accurately, the effects of the second law of thermodynamics/entropy: things not constantly repaired, whether house or relationship, inevitably deteriorate. Time/entropy is represented in the film by the unceasing flow of sand.  Light and shadows - prominent throughout the film - symbolize the dualities of life.
It is easy to make a case that the movie has a misogynistic tone. Certainly the image of woman as an ant-lion lurking at the bottom a sand pit is not the most flattering. But upon further analysis this view must be rejected. The reason the protagonist does not return to his former life (once given the chance) is simply that his former life lacked emotional meaning. The struggle with the woman at the bottom of the sand pit, although grim in certain respects, reconnects him with those parts of himself which his overly civilized and sterile city life had disconnected.",1049328000,66,2972,4.8619329388560155
686674,5,6303593410,"Certainly, ""Woman in the Dunes"" is not for everybody.  But I watched it two weeks ago, and am having a difficult time forgetting it.

686675,5,6303593410,"A man from Tokyo roams the Japanese desert to get away from the busy city and to capture various insects for study.  He wanders a little too far with nowhere to stay as night approaches.  The local villagers tell him that he can stay with a local woman.  They lower a ladder down into a house in the midst of a sand pit.  The woman is attractive, friendly and hospitable.  When the man attempts to leave the next morning, he discovers that he has been tricked: there's no way out of the pit without the ladder, which has mysteriously vanished.
The obvious questions are why has this man been trapped and what is his role in the village?  I won't go into the answers, but `Woman in the Dunes' gives viewers a lot to think about and a lot to examine.  Part allegory, part parable, part fable, `Woman in the Dunes' is an absorbing story of loneliness, manipulation, and sexual energy.
`Woman in the Dunes,' if nothing else, is a glorious lesson in cinematography.  The film's images are guaranteed to stay with you for a long, long time.  In some ways, `Woman in the Dunes' contains some of the most spectacular desert scenes ever filmed.  They are not on the same scale of a film like `Lawrence of Arabia,' but they are nonetheless spectacular.  But the film is much, much more.  This is a film you'll find yourself thinking about for a long time afterward.

There is much to contemplate in this tale of an entomologist, the woman with whom he is imprisoned, and the savage villagers who derive both their livelihood and a twisted sense of pleasure from the couple's predicament.  It says much about the ambivalence that many Japanese feel toward society: on one hand, they feel a sense of obligation to sublimate their own needs to those of the group; on the other, there is a deep sense of resentment and a feeling that they are not properly appreciated for their sacrifices.

686699,5,6303593410,"Ok so if you are reading movie reviews of a 1964 subtitled B&W film from a Japanese director you may already have passed the test. I bought this film since it was advertised as haunting, erotic and unforgettable. Two out of three ain't bad since I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since seeing woman in the dunes yesterday afternoon.
The imagery in the movie is out of this world as a young entymologist (studies bugs) wants to escape the hustle and bustle of Tokyo and find a bug in the dunes of a rmote part of Japan that will make him famous. The bug he discovers is himself as, after missing the bus, he dropped into a sand pit in the dunes to help a young woman contiually dig the sand out of the hole while the villagers keep them fed just like worker bugs. Seems like the poor vilagers decided this was the cheapest way for them to avoind the sand dunes taking over the whole village.
It doesn't take long for our hero to realize that he's been tricked and he is now in about the same situation as one of the sand bugs he hunts for. (The director spoon feeds us several scenes in which the camera takes a super close ups of skin and hair that looks not unlike bug pictures on a museum wall) Although excape is not impossible our hero undergoes a metamorphisis as he discovers that he got there since he wanted to escape from it all and he certainly did. The inevitablility of sex in the dune is of course fulfilled but I got the distinct impression that our hero never really falls in love with the woman in the dunes but rather begins to understand her and the inevitability of her life.

The only other highly charged sexual drama that involves the natural world in such an insidious way, that I can recall, is the excellent Angels and Insects.  But this is far more remarkable than that movie.  The photography is beautiful, at times concentrating on the impeding drifts of sand as the entomologist is conscripted by the eerie woman of the title to prevent her home from being consumed.  Believe it or not, this is practically the entire plot.  The sand patterns, sometimes drifting like silk, sometimes collapsing in damp crusts, are gorgeous and terrifying.  The woman herself is equally ineluctable and passively frightening.  The man cannot escape from his deceptively simple entrapment.  I won't even begin to imagine how this bodes for Abe or Teshigahara's conception of the male/female relationship, but the tight focus of this movie, the world within a world, is mind-boggling and fascinating, a hell much like the claustrophobic hotel room of Sartre's No Exit.
