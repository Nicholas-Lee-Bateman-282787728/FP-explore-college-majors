1080284,5,6305824584,"Ever since I saw this movie on TV, I have been fascinated by it.

Of course, it helps that two of my favorite actors are in it.  Samantha Morton as usual is marvelous.  With every role she plays she is different.  Rupert Graves is also as versatile as ever.  I am watching this movie right now on TV, again.  I know I've seen it at least fifteen times or more.  I still found it hard to believe that she would just move in with Harry (who is played marvelously by an actor with whom I'm not familiar). I still wonder about the ending--did she or didn't she go with Lees?  This is a movie not to be missed.  I'm still hoping it will go to DVD before I purchase it.",1130976000,2,663,4.038461538461538
1080285,5,6305824584,"I have loved Rupert Graves forever or so it seems, so it was with pleasure that I watched this film.  It's a beautiful movie, very moving.  Samatha Morton is quite lovely as Eva and of course Rupert is just brilliant as always.  It's a quiet film but it has so much depth to it you will just fall in love with it. Highly recommended.",1099353600,6,333,4.171875
1080286,5,6305824584,"The story is old, and has been told before, but this time is told in a beautiful and refreshing way.  Eva (played beautifully by Samantha Morton) is a young woman torn between the distant cousin she has loved since childhood, Joseph Lees (a wonderfully romantic performance by Rupert Graves), and the affection and responsibility she feels for Harry, who has wooed her for years with a love bordering on obsession.
When she finally chooses to follow her heart with Joseph, Harry's obsession turns self-destructive and emotionally twisted, thus bringing out the responsibility Eva feels for him.  The film grows slightly dark at this point, but never loses sight of the romantic side - the light at the end of the tunnel.
The cinematography is wonderful and strikingly real, and the actors are all at their best - particularly Lee Ross, who as Harry carries off the vulnerability, obsession, and slight madness with astonishing skill.  But by far the most interesting part of the movie is the end, which leaves the viewer to make up their own mind as to how the story ends.
This film grabs you from the very beginning and never lets you go.",1004832000,13,1139,4.801020408163265
1080287,5,6305824584,"Eva's love for her second cousin Joseph Lees, resides deep within her.  Her psyche reverts to daydreams of his uncertain present life in all her quiet moments.  Meanwhile, Eva is enticed by her own unmistakable desire for a persistant young man named Harry.  Eva makes hasty decisions and allows herself to begin a relationship with Harry. She settles for an imperfect attachment, and then when circumstances reacquaint her with the object of her dreams, she's forced to not only see her choice is not at all simple, but also to realize why her too hurried and mistaken decision to move in with Harry was unwise.  Samantha Morten embodies Eva perfecly. Her mental grappling with facing the error of her choices is shown in her raw anguish.  She is the spirit of heartwrenching desperation, then later uncertain conviction.  I have yet to watch this film and not feel deep pain as Eva struggles to gain composure, when realizing she's just said goodbye to her dreams and must face her reality.  It's a beautiful story that tells what a danger naivete' can be.  Somehow it even encompasses those moments when happiness is destroyed just by opening the wrong door.  I personally applaud Samantha Morten, she's a tremendous actress.",991699200,2,1228,4.922330097087379
1080288,5,6305824584,"I saw a preview for this movie before another movie, and it drew me in right away, due to both the storyline and the fact that Rupert Graves was in it. The moment I put it on, and saw the amazing subtleness of Samantha Morton's acting and the warm tone and sense of the entire movie I was in love. The story is something from the soul of a melancholy poet, and luckily the making of the film kept up with the emotion behind the story. I found Eva's supposed duplicities to be fully within character, the character of a young woman in love with an almost untouchable, seemingly stuck in a life in which she must settle for things that will not make her happy. The dialogue, the filming, and especially the acting are so perfect I am still amazed. The first time I saw the ending I was a bit confused, but when i watched it again I realized that the camera moving over the warm grass signified her leaving with the one she wanted. Samantha Morton is possibly the most sensitive actor that I have ever seen: everything shows on her face, her hands, her whole body. You can imagine what she is thinking, and can tell when she is thinking of her loved one, even though nothing is said. The movie was so subtle, thusly avoiding sentimentalism, but conveying the emotions and everything about the story so intensely. Furthermore, the photography was stunning, the abnormal shots of close ups of hands, water, outside, and the whole movie is lit ( possibly dyed) with a yellow color that adds to the emotion, giving it a more lifelike appearance. A sensitive dreamer's dream movie, of which there are not many, these days. poetic. re-affirmed my notions of love. My dream movie.",991008000,3,1670,4.514851485148514
1080289,4,6305824584,"Dreaming of Joseph Lees is the quintessential little movie, British style. It is a beautifully photographed movie played by a cast of genuine actors you probably never heard of. The setting is rural England (actually photographed on the Isle of Man) in the late 1950's. It is a love story with a classic triangle. There is not a wasted scene, not a wasted moment.
Eva is a young woman who dreams romantically of an older second cousin, Joepth Lees, she remembers from when she was a girl. Joseph is a geologist who works in Italy where he lost a leg in a quarry accident. Eva thinks about him a lot, has heard about him from time to time but has not seen him in many years. In the meantime, she has come of age, has finished school and works in a lumber mill while also caring for her elderly father and younger sister. One of the local boys who works at the mill and tends his farm, Harry, is interested in Eva and lets her know repeatedly in a rather crude way. Eventually, seeing no other hope for male companionship, she moves in with Harry. Guess who shows up at that point? The remainder of the movie is Eva's emotional see-saw as she tries to decide between Joseph and Harry. There are hints (some metaphoric, some unexpected, some both) as to outcome along the way. She finally chooses, and the movie ends as it must.  Although some things about the movie do not quite ring true (they could not, at least, have happened in rural America during the same time period), it is a good period piece. Someone suggested it is not a subtle movie but neither the sex nor the violence, both are present, are played strongly. By American standards the movie is subtle. Nothing is blown up in a ball of fire. Most of the blood is just from a nosebleed. There are no gimmicks. The movie rides on the photography, the acting and the story, just like any movie should.
And how are those features? The photography is superb. The acting is flawless. The story is good, certainly good enough to make a worthwhile vehicle for the visuals and for the acting.",975283200,19,2045,4.453333333333333
1080290,4,6305824584,"Samantha Morton is Eva, a girl in 1950s England who has always had a crush on her cousin, Joseph Lees.  Joseph went to the war and lost a leg there, and a more grown up Eva now wonders what has become of Joseph, although she  would never admit it to her family.
Local lad Harry is always pursuing  Eva, and it's obvious he only has one thing in mind, which in the end,  reflects badly on Eva, who after proclaiming that she will never ""go  to heaven"" with Harry, goes ahead and does the deed with him  anyway.
Soon after, however, Eva runs into Joseph at a wedding and her  crush returns full force, but it's no longer a girlish crush.  Gentle  Joseph returns the affection but he soon discovers Eva's relationship with  Harry (they live together now) and goes home.
Eva follows Joseph, leaving  behind Harry, who gets more and more unstable with every passing second,  and what he ends up doing to win Eva back is nearly unbelievable.
The  biggest flaw here is the character of Eva.  I agree with the reviewer below  that it's pretty amazing that she moves in with Harry soon after telling  him off, not to mention that she goes back to him after his infidelity.  It's like there are two Evas here, one who leaves everything to be with  Joseph and the other one who submits to Harry's lunacy.
All in all,  however, these are three wonderful English actors - if you saw ""A Room  with a View"" you might remember Rupert Graves (Joseph) as Helena  Bonham Carter's brother Freddy Honeychurch.",961977600,4,1488,4.477611940298507
1080291,4,6305824584,"Every so often I like to rummage through the minor titles with and see if I can find a sleeper with a no star cast.  `Dreaming of Joseph Lees' was a pleasant find.  It is a coming of age romance/drama about a young woman in  rural 1950's England and her two loves.  Though the story has a few flaws,  it is done with great sensitivity and it will tug at your heart  strings.
Eva (Samantha Morton) works in a sawmill and is being pursued  relentlessly by Harry, a love sick puppy, whose aggressive bravado belies a  deep rooted insecurity.  Eva carries a smoldering ember for her distant and  much older cousin Joseph (Rupert Graves) whom she hasn't seen since she was  a child.  Joseph went off to Italy to become a geologist and lost a leg in  an explosion at the site.  Harry persists in his wooing of Eva and  eventually, she succumbs to his charms.  After they move in together, Eva  sees Joseph at a family wedding and the ember rekindles to a full blown  bonfire.  Joseph returns her affections and Harry becomes Eva's dilemma.  As Harry realizes he's lost her, he has an emotional breakdown and Eva's  guilt brings her back to him.  But Joseph won't give up and he implores her  to leave Harry and come with him to Italy.  So Eva has a decision to make,  love or duty.
The film has a lot going for it.  Samantha Morton was  wonderful as the emerging Eva.  She played the part with the tentativeness  and tittering of a young girl, but the sensitivity and tenderness of a  young woman.  Eric Styles, in his first feature did a nice job with the  photography, making it very soft and romantic throughout.  The love scenes  were very well done, more loving than sexual.  Everything was done very  tastefully.  There was no violence, nudity or profanity.  The props and  costumes were true to the period.  Styles needed a little better pacing,  often drawing scenes out beyond what was necessary to convey the message.  This sometimes made the story drag.
The story itself has a few flaws.  It was primarily a character study and as such it lacked character  development.  Eva tells her father that she doesn't want to end up like her  mother, but never elaborates.  Harry tells Eva that he doesn't want to end  up like his father, but likewise never explains it.  We know almost nothing  about Eva's early relationship with Joseph that spawned her crush.  A  little bit of background would have helped our understanding of the  characters immensely.
Also, Eva decides to move in with Harry after  seeing him for two weeks.  Her father puts up only whimpering resistance  and the townspeople all wink and nod.  No scandal, no gossip.  This is not  very plausible for rural 1950's England.  Also, to think that Eva would  return to Harry after he cheated on her and after her affection had been  returned by her one true love is really a stretch.
Lee Ross as Harry was  sometimes very good and sometimes too melodramatic.  He was overly  obsequious with Eva and gave his character very little subtlety.  However  he did a very good job of portraying Harry's torment once things went  sour.
I enjoyed this film and rated it a 7/10.  It was a little overly  schmaltzy, but charming.  If you like a sentimental romance you'll probably  enjoy it.",960854400,8,3244,4.586267605633803

1080360,2,6305824584,"I love the actors in the film. However, the plot itself, aside from slow, was needlessly tragic throughout. Full of co-dependencies and relationships lacking any healthy semblance of love. Lots of manipulation and self-indulgence. The viewer is left with less of a sense of pity for the characters than a general sentiment of disdain.",1352851200,,334,5.203703703703703

The locale, society, its mores, and that era are presented and explored with great characters, performances, cinematography, and a little music and dance.
The little actress featured as the pre-teen is especially charming.

 a heartbeat, which is what I have been trying to do.  Every now and then I will check to see if it may be on DVD, but to no avail.  What must you do to make this happen?  If you ever get a chance to see it, do so.  It is heartbreaking. romantic, and
hopefully it turns out satisfying.  I still, after many viewings, haven't decided about the ending.",1320969600,,598,4.017094017094017

Absolutley Loved everything about this movie. I thought that the cast was brilliant. Graves and Morton were masterful with their sublety on just how powerful their feelings were for each other. This is a definite recommend for anyone who enjoys a good romance.",1306713600,,305,5.12
1080365,5,6305824584,"I would like to mention an important difference between this VHS tape version of DREAMING OF JOSEPH LEES and the ""Video on Demand"" one available here at amazon.com. Simply put: the VHS one ""has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen"" (to quote from the VHS box and the actual tape). In other words, rather than respecting the original ratio of the film, they chopped off the left and right sides of the image to make it conform to the old TV format.
The ""Video on Demand"" version presents the film in its original ratio, and shows that DREAMING OF JOSEPH LEES was not only beautifully photographed but beautifully composed as well. Seeing it at last as intended only increases my already high respect for the work of director Eric Styles and cinematographer Jimmy Dibling. An excellent transfer all round, and definitely to be preferred to the VHS tape.",1251417600,3,896,4.75

1080367,4,6305824584,"1958,Somerset,England:Eva (Samantha Morton) has dreamed since childhood of her second cousin,Joseph Lees (Rupert Graves).It has been years since Eva has seen Joseph, a geologist who has been to Italy and Africa, and has also lost a leg in a quarry accident. She carries his picture with her and often stares at it and daydreams of him. Life,though,is happening all around her. She has been taking care of her widowed father and younger sister,Janie ( a really interesting character aptly portrayed by Lauren Richardson),and she is emerging as a young woman with desires. Harry Flite (Lee Ross),a local farmer is compulsively smitten with Eva and actively pursues her for what he believes is true love. Eva keeps him somewhat at arms length, but for whatever reason succumbs to his advances and moves in to his farmhouse. Eva,though,hears that Joseph has returned home and will be at a family wedding. Her dreams are revived when she at last meets Joseph again. This is where the action really begins! Eva has put herself in a really compromised position. She has now set up house with Harry who we now discover is not so much in love with Eva as much as he is in NEED of her to take care of him. Eva has been taking care of people her entire life and now sees her chance to have the man of her dreams;but the turmoil and the price that she will have to pay will cost her and all of those around her. There is NO easy solution and Eva has put herself in an absolutely NO WIN situation. What is great about this particular screenplay is that there is NO REAL FINAL SOLUTION to everyone's dilemma,which is a genius move on the part of the filmmakers,and  the audience is left in an unresolved state!

This is a very interesting film. It can be viewed by some as being a bit on the gloomy side. The scenes shift rather swiftly in places which allow alot of loose ends which hamper character development. Still this film has beautiful camera and lighting effects and a haunting soundtrack by Zbigniew Preisner which make for a truly artistic experience. The use of Eva's sister, Janie, as the catalyst through which Eva's thoughts and actions are conveyed are similar to the ""Greek Chorus"" of Hellenist writing. Janie's commentary runs throughout the film,and she prophetically states that ""Promises are made to keep. Promises will make you weep"" while throwing her ball against a wall. Though all of the performances are uniformly good,this is definitely a film that showcases the immense talents of a younger Samantha Morton who has since become one of the finest and most revered actresses in the world.",1175731200,2,2601,4.739514348785872
1080368,5,6305824584,"Samantha Morton is a excellent actress and this film shows her at her finest!  She breaks your heart.  Rupert Graves is one of my favorite actors so when I came across this movie several years ago, I was pleased to find another one of his films.  After watching, it became one of my favorites, a terribly irresistable bittersweet tale!  You shouldn't miss it.

7895659,4,6305824584,"I don't understand why this film is not on a (Region 1-USA) dvd.  It is better than most of the schlock (trash) on DVD:  the acting is terrific, and the plot--while a little soapy--is certainly as good as or better than the current fare we are experiencing in the media.  I have a VHS tape and I hope that I can find a reputable firm to transfer it to DVD.",1458172800,,356,4.057142857142857
7895660,5,6305824584,"Sorry to those of you who think that the ending is left to the imagination of the viewers.  I can't bear to be left hanging and won't even consider that Eva might stay with Harry, the dirty, cheating pig-farming lunatic whose manic binges are calculated to play on Eva's gentle but naive and self-destructive kindness.  Eva wouldn't last long with Harry, and surrendering herself to him would lead to nothing but tragedy.

So, readers, now that we know how the story ends, it is important to point out that the cinematography is stunning with such play on color, light and shadow (and the feelings they evoke) that I found myself wanting to lift up my feet every time ""we"" returned to the pig farm.  I say ""we"" because the director captures the imagination of the viewer so thoroughly that it's nearly impossible not to feel entrenched right there in the story, along with Joseph, Eva, and Harry.  The acting is extraordinary.  If you've ever spent any time play-going in London you know that Rupert Graves is world-class, and as Joseph Lees, he lives up to his reputation.  Samantha Morton is equally as good.  Both play fragile, lost, and thoroughly believable characters.  As for the cruel, violent, and  manipulating Harry, I can't imagine anybody performing the part better than Lee Ross.  His portrayal is so perfectly real that I cringe to think of ever seeing him again.

So, readers, how can't you possibly come away from this film believing that Harry prevailed.",1455753600,2,1472,4.820717131474104

There are scenes - long, drawn-out scenes - in which the director seems to want to capture 'carrying a torch' on film by way of slow pans around Samantha Morton's face. There are hugs actually in slow motion. I'm not kidding. As one of the other reviews points out, almost every scene drips with sentimentality, but there is nothing close to healthy emotion, just manipulation that is shameless and pathetic. On the one hand, I couldn't wait for this movie to end. On the other hand, I was disappointed with the ending. There is nothing about this film that seemed natural and organic.
