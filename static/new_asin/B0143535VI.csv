8729581,5,B0143535VI,"The incredible lives of objects, doll babies and of medical tools are presented in this gathering of works by the famed filmmakers Brothers Quay, transferred to high-definition in the first time. You get over four hours of materialincluding 12 stop-motion animated short films and five commentary tracksthat create a sublime experience of intense imagery and sound.
Highly recommended if you love stop motion animation with a twisted angle.",1486512000,,440,5.485294117647059
8729582,4,B0143535VI,"The brothers made a film in 1979 called ""Nocturna Artificialia"" that was one of my favorites and i was hoping that it would have been on this Bluray edition but it wasn't and i therefore had to deduct one star.
  On the positive side they really cleaned up these movies- sharper clearer images and improved sound.
  I especially liked to watch this improved version of ""Street of Crocodiles""- my second favorite movie behind ""Nocturna Artificiala"".
  I am just glad i hadn't given my other collection  to the library or anything before i found out that  ""Nocturna Artificial"" wasn't in this collection.
  I imagine the Brothers Quay are kind of being careful with this film- even in my regular DVD collection of their films they made them show this film apart from all the others for some reason.",1462665600,2,796,4.744525547445256

8729584,4,B0143535VI,"Quay Bros. on Blu-Ray! The definitive version until they release UHD, 4k, etc. If you're a fan, there's enough extra stuff on this disk to justify owning it, even if you have their most recent DVD version from a few years back.

The big drawback to this Blu-ray version: No Nocturna Artificialia. Yes, I've seen the documentary on the DVD where they describe how much they hate Nocturna Artificialia, calling it their worst film, etc. But that's nonsense. For me it ranks among their top 3, or at least top 5 short films. The limited animation of that generic artist's maquette is not really that big of a deal... It works well because its abstract. And any shortcomings in animation are made up for by the superb photography, editing, and sound design. Being their first documented short film, historically speaking, its an essential part of their filmography. But I digress. Yes, buy the Blu-ray if you're a fan of their films.",1456358400,4,929,4.770186335403727
8729585,4,B0143535VI,"I won't get into the films too much; I am assuming that many readers have seen one or two or all of their films already and are merely curious about this BD upgrade from the lackluster interlaced DVD version put out by Kino.  But the films are some of the weirdest, most beautiful, and thought provoking of any other artists out there.  Truly worth purchasing.

The issue with HD transfers these days is that, with grainy black and white film specifically, it almost reveals ""too much"" grain that ends up looking like digital noise.  I was ecstatic to play my favorite film, ""Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies"" but in comparison with the DVD transfer, the contrast is increased significantly.  Normally I love contrast, but this seemed a little too much.  The film grain as well, was so prominent it almost became distracting.  Perhaps it is a simple matter of getting used to the new transfer since I had been watching my DVD copy for the past 15 years.  I'm not sure, but the transfer does look significantly different and, in theory, it is much better.  The interlacing is gone, though and that certainly is a HUGE improvement.

Some of the color films this is much less noticeable and generally I would say that all the transfers are a huge improvement.  It is nice to have a little slip case and booklet with this BD as well.  Quay fans will know what they're in for.. beautiful work.  But none will match the experience of seeing the film in it's analog projected beauty.",1453161600,12,1476,4.630769230769231

8729587,5,B0143535VI,"Blu Ray really does the films justice. The Quay Brothers used fine grain film and it is well captured on the Blu-ray.  These films are a must have for any short fi collector.  These are the oddest and most fascinating shorts I have ever seen.  I've never seen stop motion animation so smooth and with so many sharp details.  You can tell their lighting was painstakingly selected.  Also there are some great commentary tracks by the Quay brothers themselves that are interesting and informative.  If you like short films, stop-motion, or just going on a bizarre trip them you must get this Blu Ray.",1448841600,7,598,4.701923076923077
8729588,3,B0143535VI,"This rating isn't for the films themselves or the quality of the transfer, both of which are wonderful, but a warning to anyone out there considering an upgrade from the older Phantom Museums set. Keep it! The blu-ray is missing some of the extras from the DVD, including Nocturnal Artificiala and The Calligrapher.",1448668800,21,315,4.962264150943396
8729589,5,B0143535VI,"This Blu Ray is amazing, the pressing is great and the transfers look beautiful; the bizarre, surreal stop motion animation of the quay brothers is finally here in HD to behold and marvel at, there is simply nothing else like it; true, the majority of people will be confused or turned off by these unique and strange films but for anyone who themselves creates art or just simply enjoys authentic and original material which showcases unique vision via moments of spontaneous creation, do yourself a favor and add this must own disc to your collection. Thank you Christopher Nolan for bringing the quay to Blu Ray.",1448236800,20,615,4.811320754716981
