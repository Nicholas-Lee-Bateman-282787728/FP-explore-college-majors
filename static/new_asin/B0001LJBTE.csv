2013014,5,B0001LJBTE,"From the mind of Jhonen Vasquez, author of insane, twisted comics, the voice of Richard Horvitz (Billy, Dagget), and the conductor's wand of Kevin Manthei (Resident Evil), Zim, an evil green alien from the planet Irk, comes to earth in attempt to take it over and give its land to his masters so they can do something cool with it.  Unfortunately for Zim, a kid named Dib is onto his plot and is willing to go to any lengths to stop him.  Now Zim, his insane robot sidekick, GIR, Dib, and his sister, Gaz, are locked in mortal combat for the fate of the Earth.
This is a brilliantly set up cartoon and the bizarre humor is hiliarious.  Zim has been cancelled and us fans have been dying for a DVD for years.  Now it's here. ...Look up there!  what a price.  What on earth are you doing reading this?  Support the Irken empire and buy this DVD!!!!",1077321600,44,846,4.3164556962025316
2013015,5,B0001LJBTE,"""Invader blood runs through my veins like giant radioactive rubber pants! The pants command me! Do not ignore my veins!"" Zim is hillarious!  That rant above is just a small example of some of his anti-human rants.  Often crying out ""Obey the fist"" as he shakes his fist in the air, Zim is about as funny as it gets for a G-rated cartoon.",1077321600,,337,4.333333333333333
2013016,5,B0001LJBTE,"I have not seen this DVD, but I have seen every episode on it. I love Invader Zim. It is imaginative and cool.
  The show is about an alien trying to take over Earth, but he stinks at it. For example: Dib (the only human who knows Zim's an alien) walks out of a chamber that Zim has been keeping him in. A giant laser cannon comes down and aims at Dib, but all that shoots out is a small muffin, hitting Dib on the head and falling to the floor.",1077321600,,445,3.879120879120879

2013028,1,B0001LJBTE,"Definitely not for adults.  If I had kids I wouldn't let them watch it, I'd read them Robin Hood, or Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli, or Huck Finn, or Hans Christian Anderson fables, or Treasure Island, or Black Beauty, or Kim, or any one of the standard classics written for children, like my Mother read to me.  I think junk like ""Zim"" is a horrible plot to make our children grow up stupid, but then I'm seventy-five and probably not a very good judge. I'm from the spare the rod and spoil the child generation.  I was looking for something amusing and I fell for the positive reviews.  Big mistake.  I absolutely hated it.",1494806400,,619,4.491071428571429

2013037,5,B0001LJBTE,Invader Zim is one of the most intelligent and entertaining cartoons ever made. Sadly removed to early from the air before it could peak. Why Nickelodeon decided to cancel this and not move it to it's sister network MTV is beyond me. I actually originally bought this on DVD and enjoyed it so much that I purchased it again on Amazon instant video. I can't begin to explain how good this show is.,1477353600,,396,4.438356164383562

It only came with one disc though. My son scratched it up pretty badly so had to buy a replacement. My favorite episodes are Doom Doom and Germs. I'm germophobic and my partner and I get a good laugh out of those episodes because that's basically how I am. It makes me wonder if the maker (Jhonen) is a little germophobic himself. I highly recommend watching for a good laugh. My 4 year old loves this cartoon, especially GIR.",1412812800,,570,4.336448598130841

Having watched ""Invader Zim, Vol, 1"", I personally do not see what all the excitement was about; ""Invader Zim"" is an okay show, but it's not going down on my list of favorite or influential shows. Any given episode's plot is predictable; Zim has to fail in order for there to continue to be a show.

2013362,5,B0001LJBTE,"What was Nickelodeon thinking?  I don't mean that to sound like a criticism of Invader Zim, but of the weird decisions the network made regarding it.  For one, what made them think that the dark humor of Jhonen Vasquez, creator of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnny-The-Homicidal-Maniac-Director-s-Cut/dp/0943151163/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnny The Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut</a>, would translate into an innocent kiddie tv show?  Were they thinking they could get another Ren and Stimpy out of it?  Regardless, Invader Zim was created, and the Viacom folks must have been--shall we say--displeased.  My guess is that the meddling began, because while the show as a whole is genius (and hence the five stars), the later episodes started showing signs of neutering: the humor was less dark, the stories not as fleshed-out.  Zim was no longer the organ-stealing, genocidal, eyeball-ripping alien, but something intangibly softer (for lack of a better phrase).  The Earth that he was trying to destroy was less parody and more muddled.  Then came the decision to cancel the show, which likely didn't surprise any of the fans, but there are less dignified ways to end a series.  TV history is virtually littered with the reruns of shows that were kept going long past their time.

2013365,5,B0001LJBTE,"Where do I start?  I'll go ahead and review the entire series since I don't want to be posting multiple copies of this review under each Volume.  The short review is that this series is awesome, and everyone should own it.  As for the long review, let's see...

The cartoon series, ostensibly marketed for children, is rather dark and disturbing.  That's probably the reason that it was cancelled from Nickelodeon (idiots that they are).  The simple plot is that Zim (an alien) is sent to earth because he is annoying to his superiors (known as The Tallest).  He mistakenly believes he's been sent to conquer it and tries his hardest to do so, although he is pretty inept at it.  Dib, a nerdy human who's obsessed with the paranormal, spends his time attempting to stop Zim and save the earth.

The show is really more enjoyable to adults, for a variety of reasons.  Well, first off, it's pretty funny because of its constant tongue-in-cheek commentary on the essential absurdity of modern society, such as our rampant commercialism and lack of creative thought.  I especially love the scene where voice broadcast from an ice-cream truck cries out that your life is meaningless without ice cream.  The madness of society is especially apparent when viewed through the eyes of Zim, to whom our society is essentially alien.  Even Zim's own Irken race, though, is a microcosm of our own social fallacies.  For example, we the viewers see the rule of the Tallest as crazy since picking leaders based on height seems so very arbitrary.  However, this is a very clever analogy for the arbitrary values we have endorsed as a species such as assigning power based on gender or skin color.  Furthermore, they have spread consumerism so far that they have entire planets devoted to being parking lots or shipping factories.

I also love the way that the series has no set hero or villain.  One could view both Zim and Dib as protagonists.  They are both opposed to one another, but neither are truly villains.  Speaking of Dib, most people don't really seem to like him, but I feel he is a very complex and intriguing character.  He really metaphorically embodies the last vestige of intelligent thought in his crumbling, intellectually-bankrupt world.  This is especially apparent in his interactions at ""Skool"", where he is an outcast.  He is much smarter than his peers and is thus misunderstood by them and ostracized.  He is the only one who cares about saving the planet even though no one is kind to him.  Indeed, he is essentially alone in his quest.  Occasionally, his sister Gaz will unwillingly help him, but she really doesn't empathize with him or understand him.  His loneliness is made incredibly poignant by the fact that he truly has no friends and yet he soldiers on in spite of this to try to save a planet full of people who despise him and show him no gratitude for his endeavors.  Indeed, it's almost painful watching his mostly futile struggles when he only manages to just stop Zim but never really wins.  Yet he keeps going and is rarely discouraged.  I think for this reason Dib truly embodies what it means to be a hero.  Out of all the ""hero""-type characters in any cartoon (or perhaps any work of film at all), Dib is the greatest.  That's why he's my favorite character of the series.

In the end, the real reason Invader Zim is such a wonderful series is because it manages to touch on all these interesting and complex themes and yet be zany, silly, and hysterically funny while being dark in a Tim Burton-esque manner.  That's not an easy accomplishment, especially for a children's show.  Overall, I definitely recommend purchasing this fine series.  I really wish Nickelodeon hadn't cancelled the series.  Let's just say that if I were an eccentric billionaire Mr. Vasquez would have all the funding he needs to continue making episodes of Invader Zim.",1243382400,4,3878,4.760119940029985

2013371,5,B0001LJBTE,"Invader Zim is a dark, disturbing cartoon that looks like someone made it that was insane (but in a good way). The basis of the story is that an alien, Zim, from planet Irk is sent to a mysterious planet on what he thinks is a mission to conquer it. His leaders, The Almighty Tallest, only sent him away to be rid of him for a while. Zim and his robot servant, GIR, just so happen to land on Earth. Sadly, Zim is unequipped to handle the challenges that await him on Earth. To make matters worse for Zim, a child with a huge head named Dib sets out to stop Zim at all costs.

One character you will learn to love is GIR. GIR was meant to be Zim's robot slave, but the Tallest weren't sending him on a real mission anyway so they just filled a robot with trash. GIR screams like a maniac and says random things that you will love.

This DVD also comes with animatics and commentary settings for each show. The commentary is very interesting and fun to listen to and involved serveral different members of the show. You also get the un-aired pilot episode that has the guy who does GIR's voice doing Zim's voice.

This is episodes 1-9 in the first season. Since all the episodes are split into two stories, except the first, you are getting 17 different stories.",1214870400,,1260,4.285714285714286

2013382,5,B0001LJBTE,"Got a bit of a dark streak in your soul?  You like slightly sinister humor such as Billy and Mandy, the Addams Family, or Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. Perhaps you  enjoy such  sassy, ""quirky"" cartoons as the (pre-Network) Duckman, Ren and Stimpy,  Drawn Together or South Park, and you're looking for something not dumbed down or cutesy to laugh with next.  What's next, my friend, is Invader Zim.

If you're new to the Invader Zim series, let me clue you in on a few factoids before you rush in.  First, this IS NOT FOR KIDS.  That it was originally aired on Nickelodeon is admitted to have been a mistake which led to I Z's early demise after one season.  This *is* a funny, sometimes macabre and twisted account of one alien's attempt to advance his career by softening Earth for the supposed Irken invasion. The dialog is a treasure trove of catch phrases for the swelling ranks of subcollegiate fans.  The plots and many of the sly caricatures (such as Bloaty's Pizza Hog, which must be seen to be believed) are right over the heads of the under-12 crowd.  It is full of side-splitting social satire and not-so-subtle zingers aimed at the human race's general cluelessness and Zim's cosmic incompetence.  Little details suggests a constant state of filthiness and decay; window frames and cracks in the architecture everywhere that appear to be oozing a faintly visible slime, kids are portrayed as sickly, neglected and unkempt creatures who appear to be fair game for Zim's evil schemes as much as the adults, and the school cafeteria lunches are disturbingly, uh, alive.  Plus, there are occasionally some horrifying monsters.  Not what I would show to the children before bedtime, or anytime...but a lot of fun for a snarky adult like me.

Creator Jhonen Vasquez has given us some original and truly memorable characters and plots with I Z, and this first of three Dvds is an excellent introduction to most of them.  We get to view the not-often-aired pilot episode, which explains Zim's setup by the sniggering Tallest leaders who are just trying to get rid of him on a ""super secret"" mission, how his robot sidekick Gir got a paperclip for a brain, and how Zim chose and designed his disguises and base of operations.  We meet his classmate Dib, obsessed with paranormal investigation and now obsessed with exposing Zim, except that he's the only one who is smart enough to both see through the feeble disguises and care enough to try again and again to foil him.  Gaz, Dib's formidable sibling, is perhaps the only character competent enough to be a true nemesis for the Irken empire, -- but she'd rather focus on getting to the next level in her video games.  Their elementary school teacher Miss Bitters is some kind of cross between a witch and something reptilian, but of course nobody questions it.  It is the main irony of Vasquez's skewed view of this universe that his humans seem more alien than the aliens themselves.

As simple-but-seamless hybrid animations go, I Z is up there with the best and will look good for many years to come.  Nonetheless, turning on the animatics feature was an interesting peek into the creative process behind the cartoon's visual design and direction, which features both traditional and computer generated imagery.  I also thought it would be fun to listen to the commentary from Jhonen et al., but after the first few episodes of light banter with little insight or new information, I decided I would much rather enjoy the cartoon by itself.  Maybe those fans who were true Vasquez devotees would bask in that sort of thing, but I'm in it for the Zim alone. The biggest fault of this Dvd is that there are only 17 episodes on it, however, that just gives me more to look forward to as I collect the next two discs to complete my trilogy and lovingly house in the House Box.

Granted, I did not buy the disc in a store, but I did buy it new. However, when I first opened the box, the bit of plastic on a hinge holding disc one fell forward into my lap.

Not a major complaint, but it does make it a hassle to deal with volume one when the box falls apart every time I open it, not to mention, it makes it much easier for the disc to get scratched.

My friends and I were, needless to say, crushed when Nick pulled it off the air after angry complaints from parents. In hindsight, I can't really see why it was put on the channel to begin with. Placed somewhere else and marketed more to adults, it could have been the next Simpsons. But alas.....In conclusion, this DVD (and the others like it) are the next best thing to the show's continuation. I will soon devour old classics with pleasure.

2013389,5,B0001LJBTE,"I was so excited when this show finally came on DVD! The ""Invader Zim"" series consists of three complete DVD sets with commentary from the director and cast members, along with several never before aired episodes on the third DVD. In my opinion, the first two DVDs are a must have, while the majority of the third DVD begins to seriously slack off in its humor levels. Although its failure as a long-lived Nickelodeon cartoon is apparent, Invader Zim is one of the funniest, most warped animes ever created! I'm quite positive that the reason the show didn't fair well on Nickelodeon is because the humor is mainly directed towards adults, and not children. Had Invader Zim premiered on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim,"" it would've been a definite hit.

Writer Jhonen Vasquez (sorry if that's spelled wrong) is brilliant in his creation of a brash, annoying, and extremely idiotic alien named Zim. Zim and the other green-colored aliens like him are known as Irkens (Urkens). Essentially, the cartoon revolves around Zim's ""mission"" to destroy earth and force all the humans to become slaves to the his native race. However, Zim has no idea that the only reason he is sent to earth in the first place is because the other Irkens desperately want to get rid of him.

In order to carry out his mission, Zim comes up with a plethora of weird, hysterical schemes. For instance, on one episode Zim discovers that Mars is actually a moving, navigable entity, and he decides to take Mars and repeatedly ""bump it up"" against the earth until all the humans are squished! All in all, Invader Zim is a playful satire based on the apathy and well...the basic stupidity engrained in the human condition. So if you like playful, twisted humor, then this is definitely the cartoon for you.",1141776000,,1773,4.771986970684039

2013391,5,B0001LJBTE,"I first saw an advertisement for this show, and thought it looked interesting. I caught the first episode, and I literally died laughing at the dark, sick humor that was Invader Zim.

  The first thought I had after seeing this show was: This is WAY too good for Nick! My God, was I right. This show is so beautifully funny that I think that Nick just felt that this show wouldn't meet the standard of the idiotic `Nicktoons' they had (like Spongebob Squarepants, Rocket Power, Rugrats and Chalk Zone) at that time. DOWN WITH CLASKY/CSUPO! And after the show had been running smoothly for a month or two, letters came pouring in from angry parents stating that the show wasn't for young kids. WELL DUH! Why do you think it was on at 9 o'clock at night?! Also, nothing by Jhonen Vasquez is for young kids! Invader Zim is dark, crude, brilliant, and filled with hysterically witty one-liners. The word Nickelodeon does not deserve to be spoken in the same breath as Invader Zim.

 The title character (Zim, of course) is a little green alien from the planet Irk. The leaders of this planet, the Almighty Tallest, are bent on conquering every planet in the galaxy, making them part of the Irken empire. After Zim single-handedly destroys their first attempt at this, Operation Impending Doom, he is banished to Foodcourtia (see Volume 3), where he fries stuff. After ""quitting being banished"", the Tallest send him on a ""top-secret mission"" to conquer a planet so secret that ""no one dares speak it's name"". Armed with his demented robot, GIR, (whose mind is made up of exactly one paper clip, 2 cents, and a candy wrapper), Zim sets off to this secret planet.

 This planet ends up being Earth, of course. Basically, the show is about Zim trying to fit in and take over Earth at the same time. Some characters are introduced, like Dib, Zim's geeky, paranormal-loving arch-nemesis, and Dib's video game obsessed goth sister, Gaz. Zim attends ""Skool"" and his perfectly creepy teacher is Miz Bitters.

 This DVD had so many features, including hilarious commentaries from the creators, voice actors, story board artists, and writers for the show for most episodes, a pig commentary (which is really annoying in my oppinion) for one episode, a spanish language track, and Irken subtitles.

Invader Zim is no exception.  Less gory than Johnny, for obvious reasons (appeal to kids.  End of story), and more silly/funny, Invader Zim's best feature is still its subconscious commentary on human beings, their general stupidity, and the strangeness of life on this world.  Of course, characters like the paranoid Dib, the depressed Gaz, and the megalomaniacal Zim couple with the chaotically insane Gir to make this amusing and fun as well as meaningful.  Any fan of Jhonen should own this collection, so that the silliness, madness, and outrageous-ness can be watched again and again.  It's Invader Zim!  It's Jhonen!  No more needs be said, except...

With GIR's help, Zim must conquer earth.  He disguises himself as a human child and attends school.  No one suspects him except Dib, an outcast at school with a fixation on alien invasions.

The humor is advanced for Nickelodeon, most likely the reason they finally pulled the show.  Body functions and toilet humor abound, along with some great one-liners.  Pure cartoon entertainment, especially for fans of Jhonen Vasquez's humor.

My one complaint would be that there are no English subtitles.  For those of us who are a little hard of hearing, I like to have subtitles sometimes.

Here's a rundown of the episodes:

Disc One:

Episode One-The Nightmare Begins

On Irkin, Zim shows up late for Invader assignments and is sent away in a random direction with GIR, just to get rid of him.  Zim lands on earth, and sets up his base for plotting to destroy the planet.

Episode Two-Bestest Friend

Zim discovers he won't fit in with earthlings unless he has a friend.  So he tests several of the kids to find out who will be his bestest friend.  The tests include absorbency, electrical conductivity, and one that involved a squirrel and a taxi, but wasn't shown.  The winner is Keef!

Episode Three-NanoZim

Dib takes an incriminating picture of Zim to send to Mysterious Mysteries of Strange Mystery, to prove Zim is an alien.  Zim shrinks down and goes inside Dib's body to destroy his memory of the photo.  Dib uses his dad's nano-technology to chase after Zim, but Gaz has to take over the controls to defeat Zim.

Episode Four-Parent Teacher Night

Zim has to reprogram his mechanical parents to attend Parent/Teacher night at school, but instead of the training program, GIR changes the screen to his favorite programs (like the Scary Monkey Show).  Zim winds out with really weird parents.

Episode Five-Walk of Doom

Zim gets lost on purpose to test his new geographic locator, but GIR removed it to make room for a cupcake.

Episode Six-Germs

Hilarious episode!  Zim buys germ goggles, only to find out his house is riddled with nasty germs.  Especially GIR.  The only thing Zim can find that is germ free is some really nasty burger meat, so he wears the meat

Episode Seven-Dark Harvest

One of my favorites!  Zim needs human organs in order to appear human to the school nurse.  He steals organs and replaces them with items like hall passes, cartons of milk, and cans of soda.  At the end, he is bloated with organs.

Episode Eight-Attack of the Saucer Morons

Zim declares war on bees.  He crashes his ship in the park during a UFO convention.  ""Ride the pig, GIR, ride the pig!""

Episode Nine-The Wettening

When it rains, Zim discovers that water hurts him.  Unfortunately, so does Dib.  What follows is the world's ultimate water balloon fight.

Disc Two:

Episode Ten-Career Day

This is likely the most disgusting, and therefore one of the funnier, episodes.  Zim wants to be Lord of All Humans on career day, but is instead assigned to food preparation.  He gets a case of zits and...well...things go downhill from there.

Episode Eleven-Battle Dib

Dib has to go through a triathlon type contest just to get his father to sign a note.  The contest includes Spido-Ractno-Rama.

Episode Twelve-Planet Jackers

Zim's telescope is broken, so he must find a more powerful one.  GIR wants to make biscuits instead.  Using the telescope, Zim finds out earth has been planet-jacked and needs to get it back from the jackers.

Episode Thirteen-Rise of the Zitboy

Zim gets a pimple, and discovers that it has the power to hypnotize humans.  He draws a face on it and names it Pustulio.  He refers to it as a 'hideous montage of humiliation and shame'.

Episode Fourteen-Invasion of the Idiot Dog Brain

When Zim is installing a new house brain, GIR gets in the way and GIR's brain winds out in the house.  ""Shut your noise tube, taco human!""

Episode Fifteen-Bad Bad Rubber Piggy

Zim attempts to send a Hunter/Destroyer machine into the past to get rid of Dib, but GIR's rubber pig goes instead.  Zim then must use ALL of GIR's rubber pigs to change the past and stop Dib from hounding him.

Episode Sixteen-A Room With a Moose

Zim sends a bus with Dib and his classroom out into space, through a wormhole headed towards a Room With A Moose.  It's up to Dib to get the bus back to earth.

Episode Seventeen-Hamstergeddon

One of my favorites!  Meet Peepi the hamster.  Peepi is the class's new pet.  Zim alters Peepi to grow at a phenomenal rate in order to use Peepi's cuteness to conquer the world.

2013399,5,B0001LJBTE,"Invader ZIM was by far one of the most entertaining animated shows around. It was clever and it was witty. It captured my attention cause it was dark to some degree, I was familiar with the other projects that the creater had published and being able to watch an animation where some of the same characteristic drawings show through was just awesome! I have much repsect for the creator...and I'm sorry that the a lame network like nick was unable to see these things and instead prefer to air programs that are just....TRASH!!!  It's really sad when something great comes along that is not conventional people have the tendency to freak out and hide it away. I think that's what happend to ZIM....At least I have to DVD's and will never have to turn back that silly network ever again....",1123977600,,789,4.635714285714286
2013400,5,B0001LJBTE,"and that's why they cancelled it.

  Invader ZIM had everything. It was original, it had aliens, robots, Foodcourtia, robots dressed as dogs, robots dressed as dogs dancing, gothic sisters, nerds, robot parents, organs, burnt eyes, parent teacher nights, germs, giant flying pigs, glue, paranormal investigators, zits, houses being controlled by robots, rubber piggies, a room with a moose and MUCH MUCH MORE!

  I remember the one faithful day when Invader ZIM came on my television. It came on the same night as Fairly OddParents, which is a dumb show, just like other Nick stinkers as in Rugrats, All Grown Up!, and pretty much anything else on now. The day I saw Zim, I thought it was the BEST SHOW ever made. Although I don't think that anymore, I still think it's pretty darn close.

  This set, Volume 1, comes with the first 9 episodes made of Invader ZIM. They were all shown on Nickelodeon. Each half-hour episode contains 2 shorter episodes, except in Episode 1; The Nightmare Begins. So, what you're getting is 17 episodes of one of the greatest shows ever made. Trust me, it's well worth the price.

  ""Doom Doom Doom"" starts out with the first episode, The Nightmare Begins.  This show was created by Jhonen Vasquez, creator of the books Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Everything Can Be Beaten and Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors. The beginning takes place in the planet Irk, a planet where their rank is based on how tall they are. The Almighty Tallest and the rest of Irk is planning Operation Impending Doom 2, to destroy the universe and make Irk the best planet. After the assigning of the planets, you see ZIM, who was banished to Foodcourtia. The Almighty Tallest give ZIM a ""secret mission"", which is just a fake mission. Every Irken invader is given a SIR (Standard Information Retrieval unit), except Zim, who is given a GIR, which is made from trash. GIR is by far the best character in Invader ZIM. He is so stupid, it's funny. Zim and GIR are sent to the ""secret planet"" that turns out to be Earth. Gir sings the Doom Song for 6 months until they finally get to Earth. ZIM and GIR make new costumes and make a new house. (""I wanna be a mongoose dog!"" GIR) They then try to rule Earth but they're REALLY stupid. Plus, the ""weirdo"" Dib tries to stop them from ruling Earth. Also, Dib's gothic sister, GAZ, is randomly put in for more laughs. Hilarity ensues. This is one of the worse episodes, but it's by no means bad. It gets a 9 out of 10.

After that we get 17 more episodes. I'll describe them in a couple sentences, then give them a rating from 1 to 10.

2a. Bestest Friend: Zim overhears a popular girl saying he's so ""inhuman"", so he hires a best friend to complete the disguise.  He chooses Keef, a weird kid. But Keef likes ZIM a bit too much. Betcha can't guess how this ends.

10/10

2b. Nanozim: Dib takes a picture of ZIM without his disguise on and is going to send it to a science fiction show. ZIM goes into Dib's body and tries to make Dib forget where he left it.

9/10

3a. Parent Teacher Night: Ms. Bitters (the teacher from Squee AND Invader ZIM) calls a parent-teacher night one night. Having no parents, ZIM builds robot parents. This one is GOOD.

10/10

3b. Walk of Doom: ZIM tests out GIR's new guidance technology by getting lost in the city and making GIR guide them back home. Unfortunately, GIR has replaced the guidance chip with a cupcake and they get lost. GIR is great in this one.

10/10

4a. Germs: When ZIM finds out germs can kill aliens, he goes germ crazy and tries desperately to stop them. This one's okay.

6/10

4b. Dark Harvest: ZIM realizes he has no human organs and he tries to get them from his fellow classmates. This one's sick and it's not very good.

6/10

5a. Attack of the Saucer Morons: When a bee crashes ZIM's ship and an alien convention takes it in, ZIM tries his hardest to get it back. This one's the best on Disc 1.

11/10

5b. The Wettening: When ZIM discovers water can burn an Irken soldier's skin, Dib hits him with water balloons a lot. But ZIM wants revenge...

8/10

  The rest of the episodes are on the second disc. I'll review them now.

6a. Career Day: Ms. Bitters' class takes a ""career test"" which makes them tell what blotches look like. The career machine gives them a probable career and they have to follow a worker in their job around. This one's good too.

10/10

6b. Battle-Dib: Dib needs his parent's signature to present his work on ZIM to a secret investigation thing called the Swollen Eyeball Net. He has to take a test and battle some weirdo to get to Proffesor Membrane (his dad). Plus, GAZ is against him because he ate her pizza. GAZ is awesome.

10/10

7a. Planet Jackers: Another planet tries to capture Earth and drag it into the sun. This one's not too good.

6/10

7b. Rise of the Zitboy: ZIM grows a huge zit that can control minds. He hypnotizes everyone in the class, almost.

8/10

8a. Invasion of the Idiot Dog Brain: Trying to catch his squeaky moose toy, GIR ends up getting his head caught in the house's data stream. He ends up being able to control the whole house. But GIR wants tacos and is willing to blow the whole plan to get them. Best episode probably ever made.

13/10

8b. Bad Bad Rubber Piggy: ZIM finds a way to control the past with a space-time object-transfer device. He tries to ruin DIB's life, but ends up getting permanent brain damage.

10/10

9a. A Room With A Moose: ZIM sets up a fake field trip to lure his class into a room with a moose. (Which I don't understand why is so bad.)

10/10

9b. Hamstergeddon: ZIM mutates the class hamster. I didn't really get this one.

7/10

  So, there you go, the best show ever on Nick getting cancelled after 1 season. They showed all the episodes on this set and most of the ones on Disc 2: Progressive Stupidity, but then cut the show. Have you noticed they cancel all the good shows? Futurama, Family Guy, Ren & Stimpy, Greg the Bunny, the Oblongs and this! WASSUP WITH THAT!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Now I hate Nickelodeon and I have a grudge against FOX.

  But, to catch a cancelled gem, get this before Nick finds out an evil plan to get these out of production! Nick IS that evil!

This is one of my fav shows ever, even though it wasn't on for long I still love it. Just watching Invader and his ideas. If you like aliens or purple and green you will love it. Or if some kid in your school named Dik, or someother kid is obessed with aliens and things your one get this movie for ideas I don't know what that was about so I will shut up..",1117497600,,466,3.9157894736842107
2013402,5,B0001LJBTE,"Invader Zim is THE best show ever. It gives me everything I need for a good laugh. It's random, different, interesting and funny at the same time. To anyone who likes shows like Ed, Edd n Eddy or Spongebob: This is a great addition.

Zim is the little ailen sent on a ""secret mission"" to Earth. But he was really sent there so he will be as far from the Almighty Tallest as possible. While Zim thinks he's trying to destroy Earth, he uses a pathetic disguise as a human kid and only Dib can see through it.

Dib is the paranormal one who knows (and is the only one who does) that Zim is an ailen trying to ""take over Earth"". Everyone in Skool thinks he's crazy. He has no friends either.

Gaz is downright exactly like me when I'm mad. She looks like me, acts like me, same eating habits as me, but this is not about me. Gaz is kinda gothic looking. Loooooves Game Slave (2), pizza and junk food.

Gir is exactly like me when I'm happy. Gir is the funny one, the happy one, a robot and we both LOVE PIGGYS AND MOOSES!!!! He was built by the Almighty Tallest with an old Sir and trash in his head.

Professor Membrane is Dib and Gaz's dad. He is constantly busy and the inventor of Super Toast! He's a scientist who is never really in the show often. He's much to busy. But he's more funny than smart.

Almighty Tallest sends worthy ailens to destroy a planet. For Zim, they just wanted him as far from them as possible. They pretended he was on a secret mission and Zim fell for it.

Pack in screaming, laughing, interest, all the characters and you have the best show in the universe -- Invader Zim. This DVD is worth every penny.",1114905600,2,1631,4.208333333333333

It is very, very random, often annoying for my ears and just stupid. I like a little humor once in a while and Gir's very ocassional antics are funny otherwise i am terribly annoyed with all the yelling and lack of sense. It is basicly a loser alien that cant conquer the earth and keeps getting beat by a kid. In the whole process its like ninja turtles on crack.

I HAVE A PLAN TO CONQUER THE WORLD! MAAHAHAHAHAH

No you cant ill stop you blah blah blah!...(this is when gir dose something stupid)

And the whole plan fails, a few seconds of main hero's sarcastic sister the end. So yeah i got annoyed after the first episode.

2013407,5,B0001LJBTE,"Invader Zim has never been shown on terrestrial TV here in the UK, so I bought this DVD on the strength of a mention it was given in an online review about Ren and Stimpy. I was not disappointed. This is pure unadulterated genuis.

Invader ZIM is an eccentric alien soldier from the planet Irk. He was banished from the Irken Empire after nearly destroying it on an early mission. After begging his superiors for another chance, they decide to get rid of him once and for all. They trick him into going on a ""secret mission"" to an obscure planet at the edge of the universe i.e Earth, in hopes that he'll die in transit. But their trick backfires when ZIM safely reaches Earth (along with his loopy but lovable sidkick robot Gir)and begins his not very subtle attempt at conquest. He disguises himself as a schoolboy, and now the only person who can stop him is one kid - Dib, who sees straight through ZIM's disguise and is intent on stopping his reign of ""terror"". The only problem is both are pretty rubbish at outwitting the other.

Weird and wonderful, superb graphics, excellent and mad dialogue, superb little unexpected touches that make your toes curle up in delight. BY THIS NOW!",1107475200,4,1189,4.577464788732394

Colors, voices, music and storylines are all so manic they push you around for the duration of the show.  But rather than relief at the end of it, you'll feel longing for another hit.  Brimming with psychoreferential homage to all kinds of scifi and cartoon traditions, Invader Zim makes everything its own, dressing it up in purple and green and strapping it to a rocket or raygun of some kind.  If you love cartoons, or science fiction, or science fiction cartoons, or even just pretty colors, buy Zim now and give in to its mighty fists of nonsense.",1106006400,4,663,4.641025641025641

The episodes on this DVD are great, esp. ""Invasion Of The Idiot Dog Brain"" and ""Pastolio"" which have become classic episodes amongst Zim fans.

It has endless laughter and great animation, it showed how much Nick really put into it and decided to give up upon. If Nick happens to read this: PLEASE BRING BACK INVADER ZIM! PLEASE!",1104192000,,517,4.548387096774194
2013410,5,B0001LJBTE,"I'm 53 years old & have been a fan of Invader Zim for a few years despite the show being cancelled (BI-IIIG MISTAKE Nickelodeon!) forcing my having to watch the existing 46 episodes from start to finish every so often. The attention to detail in the animation never ceases to amaze me, especially the alien technology items. The obsessed-with-the-destruction-of-Earth Zim character from planet Irk with his malfunctioning, fast-food addicted robot assistant Gir are constantly embroiled in a battle of wits with the son of genius Professor Membrane, Dib, the only person to recognize Zim as a hostile alien. There is plenty of ""subtle"" social comment throughout the episodes, such as a fast-food outfit named McMeaty's, the inappropriate school teacher Miss Bitters, Gir's frequent misunderstanding many things because of  his (it's?) literal translations of human's comments, etc. Zim's outbursts are hilarious, such as the time he demands of an earthling, ""What is the matter with you, do you have the brain worms!?!?"", the classic, ""Bring me the weasels!"" and his referring to human mouths as ""noise-holes"", the list goes on...  There's nothing I would consider inappropriate for even young children who might watch Invader Zim, they might even laugh along with mom or dad, though not for the same reasons. This is one of the 3 cancelled cartoons I'd gladly pay to see brought back, Real Monsters and Duckman are the other 2 (Are you listening Nickelodeon? home of the feeble-minded programmers)  Invader Zim is destined to become one of the most revered, classic animations ever made and WILL NOT FAIL to bring much enjoyment to those fortunate enough to see all the episodes.",1103932800,,1680,5.146520146520147
2013411,5,B0001LJBTE,"If you've never seen or even heard of Jhonen Vasquez's INVADER ZIM, it may strike you as something of an acquired taste if you're used to more innocuous fare from Nickelodeon, but this series will definitely grow on you.  Fans of REN & STIMPY and other adult-oriented animation will love it.

Quick synopsis: Zim is a ruthless, cunning, yet hopelessly incompetent soldier in the Irken Army, which seeks intergalactic domination under the Irken flag.  Unable to shake the persistent Zim and his delusions of grandeur, the Tallest, oligarchial generals of the Irken Army, assign Zim a ""secret mission"" to infiltrate and take over an ""unknown planet"" in an effort to keep Zim from screwing up a new invasion.  Thus, Zim heads for Earth - the ""unknown planet"" - with recon/sentry/assassin robot GIR riding shotgun.

This is a delightful series that should have lasted longer, but at least we have three DVDs of Zim and GIR to entertain us.  GIR has more than a few circuits loose, and easily supplies many of the biggest laughs in the series. (You must experience the ""Doom Song"" at least once, so it's highly recommended you start with Volume 1.) Earthling conspiracy theorist and would-be alien hunter Dib plays a hyperactive Harry Potter to Zim's scheming Draco Malfoy, always trying to unmask Zim before an apathetic world.

The humor is dark, satirical, and full of pop-culture references.  It's as if William Gibson, Tim Burton, and Ernie Kovacs collaborated on some of the scripts.  Composer Kevin Manthei keeps the pace going with a distinctive blend of orchestral score and bursts of industrial and techno.  The voicework, featuring Richard Horvitz and Rosearik ""Rikki"" Simons, is first-rate.

Aside from the animatic icons, which can be somewhat tough to dispel on some DVD players, I find this DVD collection delightful, something you'll enjoy watching again and again with friends.  Highly recommended.",1102377600,,1910,5.086538461538462

Anyway, I never saw a single episode after it was cancelled, and then I borrowed this from my friend and viola! I realized how much I missed this show, dark and older-kidish it is. Like most other cartoons these days, the characters speak REALLY fast, but you can still understand it, and the animation is...sharp. Yes, it's created by a guy who writes comics about a homicidal teen, but it still has an excellent storyline and completely wacky characters. Kind of funny how everyone likes Gaz's sarcasm and idle threats and GIR's immaturity better than Zim and Dib's fighting and always being at odds. I personally loved Gaz better than anyone else.

The pilot episode is included and it is interesting to see how much the show changed between the pilot and the first aired episode. The show itself is just as good as it was on TV. The episodes are also closed captioned, which makes it easy to understand some of the harder-to-hear GIR lines.

2013417,5,B0001LJBTE,"Every once in a while a wonderful TV sitcom comes around and takes the American audience by storm. Sadly, this is not one of them, but you still get the best and most original (and dare I say ""wacky"") animated series to ever run the airwaves sense Ren and Stimpy! I should probably be honest with you. When ZIM was on Nickelodeon, I never really appreciated it as I should have. But thankfully, Nickelodeon has finally decided to be smart and give the fans what they wanted, all the episodes of Invader ZIM released on DVD.

Created by the insane genius that brought you such wonderfully demented comics such as Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and Squee!, Jhonen Vasquez mixed a formula that appealed to both children and adults. The story revolves around Zim, an alien of the Galactic Irken Empire, who has been ""assigned"" to go to an enemy planet and observe it's inhabitants to prepare it for galactic conquest as part of Operation: Impending Doom 2. Unfortunately for humanity, the planet he is assigned to is Earth, and it is up to a young boy named Dib, a para-normal investigator with a gargantuan head, to save them. Did I forget to mention Zim's robot sidekick, Gir, is quite possibly the cutest, most insane being you've ever set eyes on?

A few of the best episodes on this disc include:
Bestest Friend - Zim adopts Keef as his new ""bestest friend"" in order to make the other kids at skool think he's normal.
Career Day - For career day, Zim works at McMeaty's, a fast-food resturant, in order to gain world domination.
Rise of the Zitboy - Zim develops a large pimple on the side of his face that has hypnotic powers.

This series, unlike most, has hardly any drawbacks, if any at all. It is definitely the most innovative cartoon I've ever seen, it appeals to people on many deferent levels, and it has more catch phrases and jokes than you can fit in a book! So what are you waiting for? CLICK THE ORDER BUTTON OR SUFFER THE WRATH OF ZIM!!!!!!

Dispite the fact that it originally aired on Nickolodian around the time of Spungebob and The Brothers Flubb, two of the most horrible shows ever made, Jhonen managed to get incredibly dark and intelligent humor under the noses of Nickolodeon execs. Author of the well known Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Jhonen took a leap working on a children's series, but it was a leap that made his jokes much funnier, less gruesome, and over all leaves a much better taste in your mouth.

As funny as the simpsons, but with a surprising originality you won't find anywhere else short of JTHM. Zim is truely Television brought back to where it should be. Why get this DVD? Zim still aires on Nicktoons, but much too early to actually watch, and if you, like us, don't have Digital Cable, you can't see it anyway.

2013422,5,B0001LJBTE,"INVADER ZIM is something of a miracle--a kids' cartoon series that is brimming with  pure anarchy, unbridled hostility and genuine wit. There is no ""hero"" to root for, no pat social moral to be gained--just hilariously original characters in unpredictable predicaments. Zim is an inept but zealous alien from a warrior race and is ostensibly staking out Earth for immanent doom. In reality, he is being banished by his superiors, (the Almighty Tallest) but he and his idiot robot slave are too stupid to realize it. When he arrives on Earth, Zim poses as a schoolboy, fobbing off Gir (the robot) as a puppy. The school teacher Miss Bitters is a nihilistic viper-like crone too apathetic to realize that Dib, Zim's energetic child nemesis, is the only human to see thru Zim's disguise. Zim and Dib torment each other relentlessly, and for variety Zim is also up against various other humans and (almost as often) the insane antics of his robot, Gir. The tone and humor of the show is as sharp and smart as it is shrill. I have to add that it is one of the loudest cartoons I have ever seen, but here it works as a plus.

The visuals are a little hard on the eyes at first, (and occasionally too cluttered to read clearly on one viewing) but the ambitiously warped look of the show is only one dimension of this series. The premise and characters are pitch-perfect from design to writing to voice-casting.  I had never heard of Jhonen Vasquez (ZIM's creator) before catching some choice episodes of the show before it was cancelled . After checking out some of his demented comic book work I was duly impressed by his phenomenally unique and entertaining writing, which has been only slightly ""toned down"" for TV.

It comes in a two-disc set seperating the episodes evenly between the discs and is loaded with extras, some of which include Irken subtitles, piggy commentary (I feel they gave in-depth insight into the show.) and interviews with the voice talent of the show, also the pilot for the series, which is a little raw but still very entertaining.

The two discs are packaged in a case that appears to be a single disc case, making it alot more convienient, cheap, and easy to carry around.

The creators of the menus had the idea with a simple straightfoward interface and some interesting techno-esque background music.

The voice actor interviews (on disc two) are very well done and enjoyable, they oftenly refer to Jhonen Vasquez (creator) as a genius and as a creative mastermind. (which he is.)

The piggy commentary is very satisfactory, giving new insight into the episode ""Bad bad rubber piggys"".

The Irken subtitles help to show the fans of the series who aren't from earth what exactly everyone is saying.

The extras only help to fuel how great this DVD set is, the best thing about it is of course the show itself, which can be viewed with or without animatics/commentary/Irken subtitles/etc.

The show Invader Zim is excellent, a great mix of humor, action, and, the sad truth about man's pointless life as invisioned through the eyes of animation master Jhonen Vasquez.

Zim, an overzealous, ineffective, and short ""invader"" was head of ""Operation Impending Doom 1"" which ended in him destroying his own planet, after being relegated to the life of the fast food industry by the Almighty Tallest he persuades them to give him one last chance to prove his merit, the Almighty Tallest don't want him to once again get in their way so they send him to an unknown planet called ""Earth"" with the hopes that they can continue with the operation, Zim is under the impression that he is part of an actual mission but is very mistaken, he was sent there without the Almighty Tallest knowing for sure that there was a planet there in the first place.

A masterpiece, 5 stars..",1091836800,4,2125,4.76566757493188

Definitivamente la mejor compra que puedes hacer, es una caricatura totalmente diferente a todas las que he visto, 3D, creativa, excelente musica,  y humor un poco fuera de este PLANETA! ZIM Rules!!!!",1090800000,,469,4.777777777777778
2013426,4,B0001LJBTE,"I'm a huge Zim fan and was saddened to see it be taken off the air, but after much patience and waiting, it has finally come out on DVD. It contains the first 9 episodes, which means you get 17 fifteen minute episodes and the first episode, ""The Nightmare Begins,"" which runs for about thirty. To get it for the price here at Amazon was truly a blessing, since you get so many episodes, and that's only the first part of the series.

 The special features are enjoyable as well. It comes with voice commentary by the creator, Jhonen Vasquez, as well as the voice actors, script writers, and art designers. Within the commentary, they joke around and explain back stories behind some of the episodes, making it all more enjoyable for the viewers.

 Also included in this DVD is the original pilot episode, for those who don't know, it's the episode Jhonen showed to Nickelodeon to see if it could be made into the series it is today. Compared to future episodes, the pilot episode is weak and the voices are all different except for Dib, but it still has it's classical comical relief.

 The DVD also comes with pig commentary, which can only be heard on the episode, ""Bad Bad Rubber Piggy,"" as well as subtitles in the Irken Language. While these additions are funny as first glance, it's really kind of pointless. But other than that, the DVD is great.

 If you're an Invader Zim fan, or a fan of Jhonen Vasquez's other works, then I highly suggest you get this DVD.",1090368000,,1467,4.509433962264151
2013427,5,B0001LJBTE,The only thing I can say against Invader Zim is that it is now over. One of the best cartoons of the past decade. DVD = good.,1090108800,,125,3.6666666666666665
2013428,5,B0001LJBTE,"Let's all sing the DOOM song!  <insert about 50,000 dooms here>
Although I'm a fan of Jhonen Vasquez's ""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac"" comics, I never really gave Invader Zim a good look through.  Then, through the miracle of DVD players, I was given a rather impressive introduction.  Zim is one of the greatest cartoon villians ever: campier than Izma (Emporer's New Groove), more ruthless than the Decepticons (Transformers),  more sex appeal than Skeletor (He-Man) and has a maniacal laughter that makes Darth Vader jealous.  Zim is the over-zealous, ruthless super-space invader who has proven that he's just a little too battle-hungry for his own good.
I don't mean to be preaching to the choir, especially since Invader Zim has already developed a worthy cult following, but this series is dangerously addictive, with very original and cutting-edge humor.  Zim's stories follow his espionage mission to Earth, where he tries to pass himself off as a grade-school human, while collecting data on Earth for the inevitable invasion by his home planet.  However, even mad geniuses sometimes overlook the small details, like the fact that his own superiors sent him to Earth to get rid of him, after Zim decided to ""quit"" his exhile.
As Zim fruitlessly tries to prepare for the invasion of Earth, we watch his daily battles between him and his archnemisis, the sci-fi conspiracy-theorist geek, Dib and his apathetic computer-game playing sister.  Zim will struggle to adjust to human nature while creating robotic parents for Parent-Teacher night at School, getting lost in the big city because of his moronic robot side-kick, harvesting human organs to disguise his alien physiology to daily battles with Dib.
While the cartoon is playful and highly stimulating, I can understand why Nickelodeon dropped it from their network.  The humor is mix matched, sometimes appealing to a younger audience, but mostly to an older (and perhaps more deranged) one.  Still, I do hope that somebody will wake up and realize such a masterpiece that Jhonen Vasquez has put together.
If you have read all of this review, then add Invader Zim to your shopping cart right away.  With the steady downfall in entertainment (and the horrible recycling of most cartoon shows), I doubt we can expect anything as unique and entertaining to come out soon.

2013429,5,B0001LJBTE,Now I don't usally like Nick's shows but this one was different. I saw a commerical for it I thought of another stupid nick show like Rocket Power or Rugrats. But when I tuned in I was amazed. I like the story line a lot. Then nick stopped making new episodes and then cancelled it. I was so sad then the Dvd came out. I loved the best friends episode and Nano Dib. This is a must for Invader Zim fans. But they could of came up with a better title than Doom Doom Doom. And I think that they should have told you why Invader Zim was cancelled.,1089417600,,543,3.9908256880733943
2013430,5,B0001LJBTE,"I live in the UK and when I heard the Zim DVD was being released I squealed with joy... only to discover that it was only being released Region 1 and that a Region 2 release was not intended.
Being such a huge Zim fan I ended up buying a multi-region DVD player JUST for this dvd - and I wasn't disappointed. The picture quality is fantastic (plus theres no Nick watermark, hazzah!) as well as the sound. I recommend watching the episodes with the commentary turned on - I spent half the time giggling with them on!
If you're a Zim fan this is well worth getting - if you haven't seen the show I recommend downloading an episode or two before you buy, a lot of people don't enjoy Jhonen's humour.",1089331200,2,696,4.2406015037593985
2013431,4,B0001LJBTE,"Being another of the multitudes of fans if Invader ZIM, I thought the basic content of this DVD was great, but I was a little mixed on the way the extra features were done. I loved listening to the audio commmentary, hearing little tidbits and learning secrets as to where ideas came from, why they chose certain scenes, and their criticsm on the looks of certain episodes. However, getting the extras to work was a little tricky. It looked like they started out taking the time to put the extras together the right way and then ran out of time and slapped the rest together. I did find the Irken subtitles kind of annoying, and the piggie commentary was VERY annoying. Besides that, who the heck decided on the cover art? I love ZIM's array of crazy expressions, but the cover has the most hideous drawing of him I've ever seen! It looks like someone stuck a high-power air hose in his mouth and cranked it past 11 on the dial....",1089072000,2,931,4.450292397660819
2013432,5,B0001LJBTE,"Well, Nick made good on their decision to cancel Zim forever from the airwaves.  The only problems I can think of with the DVD are the mispelling of 'Irken' on the back, and the fact that the Irken subtitles automatically come on when you put the DVD in the player.
Aside from these, however, the DVDs are packed with solid entertainment.  They even have commentaries for some of the episodes, as well as a feature where the sketchy storyboards are shown onscreen with the original audio playing.  The hilarious pilot episode is included as well.
One of the best inclusions is the interview with the voice actors.  It may surprise you to learn that GIR's voice actor is a tired-looking guy who mumbles a lot... and that Zim's voice actor's voice really does sound like that.
I would have been content with just the episodes, actually, so I was pleasantly surprised... the commentaries are well-done and very funny, what with Tallest Red's voice actor always complaining about how Tallest Purple stole his lines and the other little in-jokes here and there.  Also, you get to hear the enigmatic Vasquez speak about his masterpiece, which is grood.  And great.  And good.  Great and good.
This package has a solid five-star rating all the way through for a reason.  There is really nothing else one could hope for... excepy maybe a GIR dog plushie.",1088812800,12,1346,4.767241379310345
2013433,5,B0001LJBTE,"Invader Zim is very worth watching.  Zim is an alien (Irken) who is intent upon conquering the Earth, which he believes he's been assigned to do by his home planet. Actually, the people in charge of the alien planet just sent him to Earth, which is to them a piddly nowhere little planet, to get him out of the way because he is such a screw-up.

Zim is completely unaware of the fact that everyone regards him as a screw-up, and is very fanatical about his quest to conquer Earth.

Zim has a goofy sidekick robot named Gir who was taken out of the garbage and given to him when they sent him on his ""quest"" to conquer Earth.  Gir is a hilarious character, and is part of waht makes theseries so great (he reminds me very much of my cat, I think I would've named her Gir if I had seen any episodes of Zim before I got her).

There is one person in the whole universe besides Zim who actually takes his quest to conquer Earth seriously, and that is his nemesis, Dib.  Dib is a human boy who is obsessed with aliens,and heis the only person who realizes Zim is an alien.  He tries to tell everyone but no one believes him, so he singlehandedly tries to thwart all of Zim's plots.  It always backfires on him, and Zim's plots always fail anyway.

The artist who wrote and drew the series is Jhonen Vasquez, who was known before Invader Zim, for the ""Johnny the Homicidal Maniac"" (JTHM) and ""Squee"" comic book series.  Invader Zim is more than just a comedy, the artwork is great and every episode is full of Vasquez's characteristic dark, subtle mockery of all the stupid things about society.

I think Invader Zim was excellently done and deserved a longer life than the less-than-a-year it was given on Nickelodeon.  I believe this was because it was being shown in the wrong venue.  I just don't think that the people who turned on Nickelodeon on a Friday night were expecting or looking for anything like Vasquez's dark, intelligent humor.  I think that most people who glanced at it just assumed it was more of the same-old meaningless Nick-toons, and never really ever tried to watch it(not that I mind Nick-toons, but not even ""Rocket Power"" or ""SpongeBob Squarepants"" come close). I myself might never have sat down to watch Invader Zim, except that, being familiar with JTHM and Squee, I recognized Vasquez's artwork when I happened to catch a commercial for the show.",1088553600,,2374,4.516355140186916

They don't give him a good s.i.r unit but instead they take the body of a s.i.r and throw assorted play things into its head, on their way to earth gir desides to sing the doom song 6 months later gir still singing they drop by earth, and their Voot Cruiser (Irken Transporter) diguises them, though not very good, gir is disguised as a green dog with the zipper clearly showing, and zim a green... boy.

2013435,5,B0001LJBTE,"This show, even though it was orrigionally made for kids on cartoon network, is so funny that even teenagers like me lvoe it. The stuff they do in this dvd are soo stupid that its halerious.
Zim, an alien, and his companion Gir, a retarded robot with bolts and a candy rapper for a brain, set out to destroy a ""mystery planet"" and ironicly they find Earth.  While their there Zim trys to find ways in destroying earth and inslaving all the humans.  but he continually fails petheticly.  A kid at ""skool"" named Dib knows hes an alien and is alwayse trying to convince others but they call him a dweeb and strange and crazy.  The teacher is a creepy snake like old lady.  And Gaz is the (gothic like) sister of Dib who alwayse gets angry at Dib and she loves pizza.  Gir is alwayse making funny one liners and doing things that you wouldn't see every day, which are halerious.
One of my favorite lines in the show is on the ep. ""Rise of the Zit Boy""  Gir just got a pizza delivered and is eating it realy sloopy.  Zim is desgusted by just the sight let alone the smell and the nasty sounds gir is making while eating it.  Gir jumps on Zims head and gets the cheese greese all over Zim.  Zim is elergic to anything ""food"" and water kills him.  So we screems and tells gir to get ""clensing chalk"" Gir gets it and Zim rubs it all over his face to get the greese off.  But when its not working Zim looks at the chalk and its unrolls into a piece of bakon.  Zim- ""GIR! why wase their BAKON IN THE SOAP!!!???"" Gir- ""I MADE IT MYSELF!!!""

2013436,5,B0001LJBTE,"Ok, I'll admit it, my main reason for watching Invader Zim was because Jhonen Vasquez was it's creator.  I really didn't know what to expect out of the show, it was hard for my brain to comprehend a nickeolodeon cartoon being created by Jhonen Vasquez, master of most things absolutly inappropriate for children.
Then I saw the show, and I was amazed.  Just by the sheer amazingness that was the show's look.  Distinctly Jhonen-esq characters, and a depth to the background that many cartoons lack.  It was visually appealing.  Not only was it pretty, but the show was funny (but were we really expecting anything less).  Funny in both the dark, gross out way and that quick witted one-liner way.
The premise of the show is that there is this Irken alien who is less than adept to do any of that conquering that the Irken empire is known for, infact this alien ruined the last Impending Doom mission.  This alien's name is Zim, he's quite full of himself and quite stupid.  He get's sent to Earth to get out of the Almighty Tallest's hair, and as standard Irken issue he must get sent with a SIR unit.  The problem with that is the Almighty Tallest don't wish to waste a good SIR unit on Zim, so he get's a robot made of trash called GIR (voice by Rikki Simons).  Frankly, Gir's stupid in that tremendously endearing way, he provides much of the comedic relief.  Upon arrival on earth Zim goes undercover as an Elementary School student, where he crosses paths with his new found nemesis, Dib.  Dib is simply a boy engrossed in the paranormal and determaned to get recognition for his research (which is basically his discovery that Zim is an alien, proving that they do exist), in the process of achieving his goals, he also tries to prevent Zim's world domination.
The DVD contains the first 9 episodes (18 cartoons) of Invader Zim.  For special features, you can listen to the episode commentary, featuring various voice actors and writers of the show and also Jhonen Vasquez.  In each episode who is present for the commentary changes, but for the most part Jhonen and the voice actor who plays Zim are always present.  Not every episode contains commentary.  Also features is the animatronics, which can make a person dizzy, therefore meriting one to watch EVERY episode in the animatronic mode.  You can listen to the Pig Commentary on one episode (which personally grates on my nerves), or you have the option of subtitles...Irken subtitles!  This DVD containes 2 disc (which was a nice surprise).",1087171200,6,2504,4.704128440366972

I am a fan on intelligent and distinctively styled cartoons like Spongebob,  Samurai Jack, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Futurama, The Tick and others them.  Invader Zim ranks right up there with the best of them.  The DVD quality is truly awsome and the stories are wicked and clever.

If something is brilliantly irevrent, and clever such as Invader Zim, and Family Guy its concidered ""too raunchy, or controvercial to stay on the air."" The hell with that! If you don't like something don't friggin watch it! Don't get it cancelled so the rest of us can't watch it either!
With that said, Invader ZIM is a fantastic show abou ZIM, the ambitious invader, who was given a second chance by ""the allmighty tallest"" to prove himself worthy as a concrour. Zim is sent to a mysterious planet that ends up being EARTH! The best thing about invader zim is its off beat humour that seems more aimed at teenagers, and adults rather then young kids. GIR is especialy random as a robot diguised as a green dog. those who are farmiliar with Jhonene's work on JTHM will (and do) LOVE this show! but some uptight idiots demanded more ""quality"" program on Nick such as Rocket Power and Chalk Zone. Its my opinion that Zim and The Fairly Odd Parents are the only good shows to grace the nick air waves since Ren and Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life were cancled.",1086739200,2,1126,4.4975609756097565
2013439,5,B0001LJBTE,"This is especially cool if you consider what value you're getting for this.  Two discs worth of the show with animatics and commentaries for them.  One episode even has multiple commentaries.  These commentaries include the important people in the show and behind the show.  That adds up to so many people that the tracks are very chaotic and resemble more of a crazy round table discussion of the series rather than screen specific musing.  At least it's interesting to listen. It haven't gotten to the animatics yet, but they talk about them in the commentary tracks and if they're as advertised, then they should be great. Can't wait for the second volume to come out and I can't believe that this aired on Nickelodeon because it's even crazier than Ren and Stimpy.

It was so stylistically unique and intense with emotion that I knew this was going to hit big. This was as revolutionary as Ren & Stimpy was when it first came out. Decades later, cartoons are still copying the style of Ren & Stimpy. But Nickleodeon totally screwed up when it came to Invader Zim. After bouncing it around to different timeslots, it dropped one of the best cartoons ever made. But at least this DVD exists!",1086566400,,528,4.627659574468085
2013441,5,B0001LJBTE,"Yes, kiddies, it is true!  Invader Zim has finally come home to DVD.  The cult hit that was too bizarre and dark for Nickelodeon to handle.  The fans have demanded for the show to be available, and now here it is.  ""Invader Zim Volume 1: Doom Doom Doom"" is fantastically wild and zany--a show unlike any I have ever seen before.
Zim has been banished by his own planet for the mayhem and destruction he had caused, but to get him out of their hair the higher ups decide to give him a ""secret mission.""  That mission is to take over a planet that nobody on the Irken planet has ever heard of--which turns out to be Earth.  The higher ups don't expect him to be successful, but Zim doesn't know that and takes the mission head on with his brainless, but highly entertaining robot slave, Gir.  Dib is a kid who is obsessed with aliens and other sorts of ""phenomena,"" and is determined to stop Zim at all costs--that is, unless his sister destroys him for taking the last soda!  All of this makes one heck of an entertaining premise for an off-the-wall animated show.
I was extremely happy when this DVD came out and got it as fast as I could.  The shows have a very high replay value and they never fail to get a laugh out of me.  It's hard to believe that such a show used to be on Nickelodeon... but I guess that's why it isn't on that channel anymore.  It is dark and creepy, but it is extremely humorous as well.  While Zim is very funny with his outbursts of anger, I have to say that Gir really steals the show.  That robot always makes me laugh in some insane way.  All of the episodes are great and never lacking.
The DVD has some cool features to offer.  It is a two-disc collection that contains episodes 1-9 (most have two episodes each).  Some features include commentary, animatics, interviews, and for fun, ""Irken"" subtitles that can be turned on during each episode.
""Invader Zim: Doom Doom Doom"" is definitely something to check out for those who have a warped and dark sense of humor.  Don't let the ""Nickelodeon"" icon fool you, this show is incredibly bizarre and outrageous!  Adults are bound to enjoy it as much as the kids, if not more.  It's great to see this show finally get the DVD treatment.  Now, you can relive some of your favorite episodes over and over again.  And if your favorite episode doesn't appear in the volume... never fear.  Volume 2 is on the way.  Highly original and entertaining. -Michael Crane",1086134400,6,2436,4.4125560538116595
2013442,5,B0001LJBTE,"I got, and am still getting, an incredible kick out of this DVD. When I bought it I thought: ""Well of course you have to buy it...you're a fan...wave the Irken flag, Buy ZiM Bonds...but really, you've seen each encode--what? 30 times? You're not going to be that interested.""
Oh my god, was I wrong. This is like Christmas morning when you're five years old.
I had no idea that this cartoon was intended to be so gorgeous.
There are audio and visual effects that the encodes, even the pretty good ones, missed or blurred or otherwise screwed up. Shimmers and halos and sweet, crispy CGI effects. Audio stuff like the background hum on the Massive (Remember Unreal? The Rikers ship?) or little chitinous clicks when the Tallest moved their claws; it's rich. Nanozim in particular turned out to be visually stunning. And Manthei's music; yeah baby. I daresay the word 'lush' might even be used to describe it.
If you're curious about the commentary, it approaches MST3K in the tall-tale, fooling around and Pathological Liar departments; it's so blasted cheerful and fun to listen to. (And I have to wonder what Nickelodeon cut, and why; I find it suspicious that there are these big blank spots, and then the audio cuts back in and everybody's laughing.)
This DVD is great. It's Campbells Condensed Cream of Fun. Buy it. If you liked the encodes, you will adore the DVD. And then ponder what a crime it is that this fantabulous show was cancelled.",1086048000,,1446,4.719367588932807

This is something you could easily see on Adult Swim, but there's really nothing to keep you from watching this with kids.  In fact, you should watch this with as many people as possible young and old.
It's absurdly funny.  There are moments when you just freeze in mid thought and burst out laughing because of some of the things that happen.
I think Zim is mostly a twisted Calvin and Hobbes.  It's just as easy to believe that Zim's whole existence is just a figment of a kid's imagination.  The way some of the episodes end, this almost make sense.  But cartoons don't need to make sense!  That's what makes this perfect.  Really one of the funniest shows to make it on TV on any station, don't let the Nickelodeon label scare you away.

2013448,5,B0001LJBTE,"Kids may like this cartoon, but it is definitely for adults or older children (teenagers and beyond). It is in the same class as ""The Simpsons"" and ""King of the Hill"". It's a little more ""cutesy"" than the aformentioned, but it is also more gross too.
""Zim"" comes from the planet ""Irk"" where tall people are the smartest and rule the planet. Invaders go to other planets and take them over - expanding the Irken empire. Zim is kinda small and kinda stupid, but has a big ego and thinks he's an all powerful genius. On his first mission he blew up other Irkens and was banished to a food (cafeteria) planet. When the second Irken invasion started Zim left the food planet and came to Irk thinking that he was a special warrior and had to be involved in the second invasion. When he irrives at Irk, the almighty tallest send him out in space on a ""special mission"" hoping he will just disappear. Zim lands on Earth with his robot which the tallest put together for him out of scraps. The scrappy robot ""Gir"" is kinda stupid, but is cute and silly and loves to eat junk food.
In order to invade Earth, Zim has an Earth boy disguise. Gir has a little dog suit that he wears (when he takes it off, he runs around screaming ""I'm naked!""). Gir's favorite activities are eating tacos, rolling around on the floor, drinking ""poop"" (softdrink), and watching the scary monkey show. Dib is a probably genius science prodigy who knows that Zim is an alien. Gaz is his also probably genius sister who plays video games all day. Dib is out to prove that Zim is an alien, but no one listens to him. He is sort of a science geek outcast. A funny animated show with the cutest cartoon character of all time - Gir!

2013450,5,B0001LJBTE,"It shouldn't surprise me that people who weren't fans of Jhonen Vasquez's work before this animated venture have seen it. After all, it stands on it's own. I'd be able to spot this as Vasquez's work in a heartbeat though- it's got the same coloring he prefers to use (blacks, purples, greens), and the very distinctive animation style (oddly cute characters). One of the things I have always loved about his cartoons (animated and still) is his gift for the absolutely absurd. The lines in this are infinitely quotable- and the voice actors are great- especially Gir's- ""I'm naked! Naked naked naked!"" ""I love this show!"" While the subtitles on this disc are useless, they did make me laugh- I mean all DVDs have to have a subtitle feature, right? Ha, as I'm typing this I am rehashing all of my favorite moments, lines, images- etc. I love when Gir leaves his navigation chip at home to make room for his cupcake, and his fuel to make room for tuna. I love the head pigeons and that when the electronic house gets built the first thing that appears is a couch. Vasquez's characters are always manic as well- alternately shouting and muttering fiendishly. Zim reminded me of an alien Johnnny (if you don't know, check out his comic series- Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee, and I Feel Sick). The parent-bots actually remind me a lot of the zombie people in Johnny too- but I should stop comparing, this is one of the weirdest and most original cartoons to make it onto a major network- possibly ever. Jhonen Vasquez is a real sly character and while I don't know how Nickelodeon wound up picking this up, I'm glad it did.",1085184000,,1623,4.619377162629758

The series is warped, twisted and hysterical.  Too bad it was cancelled and the amazing talent behind it wasn't recognized.  I love it!",1085184000,,437,4.481012658227848
2013452,4,B0001LJBTE,"I first heard of Invader ZIM while it was still airing on Nickelodeon, and had heard of the controversy it had created around the kiddie networks' headquarters. Seeing what Nickelodeon had done to Ren & Stimpy nearly 10 years before, I wasn't surprised in the slightest that the creators of the show weren't getting their way as much as they'd like.
In 2003 I downloaded some episodes as there was no other way to get them, and I instantly became hooked. The show isn't a laugh-riot from start to finish, but it's curiously interesting and occasionally does have moments that'll have you laughing, or failing that, just admiring it's weird dialog and cool neon colors.
AnimeWorks promised that they would give ZIM *the* shining example of stellar DVD treatment. While the DVD is nothing bad, calling it stellar would be very wrong. Most of the episodes have very good transfers from (I think) DigiBeta masters, giving good image quality. I think 2 of the episodes (that's 4 of the cartoons) however, have been transferred from Composite Video, meaning these episodes have Analog Cable TV-like symptoms like Dot Crawl (thankfully however, there is not much noise on the offending episodes).
As well as this, the DVD is encoded for multi-angular playback - meaning that you can press the Angle button on your DVD's remote to access the Animatic version of the episode (an Animatic being a rough pencil version of the show before the final animation is done). While this is interesting, the way the disc is mastered (and I think this might be true or all multiangular DVDs) means that each angle receives half of the video bit-rate. To cut a long story short, this means that the quality of the episodes themselves is occasionally sacrificed for the sake of this feature. Most fans won't watch the animatics more than a couple of times, so surely a better idea would have been to include clips of the animatics on seperate video tracks as Special Features. (This also means that on certain DVD players, the ""Angle"" icon will stay present on your screen for any of the episodes that feature Animatics - luckily I could turn this off on my player).
Again, the image quality is still very good, but to call it flawless would be wrong.
Special Features are also a bit thin - the extras we get are a short but good look at the Voice Cast (creator Jhonen Vasquez sadly doesn't make an appearance), and the Pilot episode. Commentaries are included and they're definitely worth listening to.
Irken subtitles are included, which seems pretty pointless. Deaf or otherwise hard of hearing viewers will be pleased to know that while there are no English subtitles that can be generated by the DVD player, English closed captions are included.
All in all, definitely worth buying - it's the best way to see ZIM. Hopefully for the remaining volumes we'll get more polished products.",1085184000,4,2865,4.813387423935091

2013456,5,B0001LJBTE,"Ok, I'll level with you... There are a lot of hilarious cartoons out there for adults these days, but none (and I mean NONE) can compare to the snappy one-liners and incredible attention to detail of Invader Zim.  The first time I watched a Zim show I practically wet my pants from laughing so hard (yes, I was 22...)!  The second one I saw, between the intermitant need to pee my pants, I also noticed how unbelievably amazing the animation quality was in this show.  Unlike so many other cartoons, the animators actually show some incredible talent and appear to take a huge amount of pride in their work.  The same can be said about the writers.  Very few ""intended"" jokes fail to illicit a stomach-wrenching guffaw from myself and my other friends.  This show is not full of fluff... it's pure animation GENIUS!!
I do agree that it is a little too intense for children and therefore, I understand how Nickelodeon took it off of the air.  What I don't understand is why the Cartoon Network hasn't picked it up and heaped loads of money on Mr. Vasquez to produce more and more until the show is forced to ""jump the shark"" from lack of material (which I see happening about 70 or 80 years from now...)
Anyway, my suggestion would be very simple:  Put down the mouse, step away from your keyboard, grab your wallet and car keys and race to purchase Zim.  I love Amazon, but seriously folks... with this cartoon, any amount of waiting is WAY TOO LONG!

My friend had 5 episodes in a burned disc and I just thought it would be just your typical everyday Nicktoon. Never would I have excpected this show to be so eerie and sometimes nasuiating but at the same time flat out hillarious! This show blends the essence of classic Nicktoon comedy like Ren & Stimpy and Rocko's Modern Life with a bit of the twisted anime action and humor (kids jumping out of second story windows when school is out.) I Was officially hooked when GIR (A hyperactive Meatwad) made his first apperence and sang the DOOM song, because he just rules! Unfortunatly I had gotten into this show too late because it already had been canceled by hoards of angry parents saying this was not a kids show. WELL DUH! It wasn't ment for kids otherwise it would be on tv at noon rather than prime time! Why do all the good shows die so soon? (The Critic, The Oblongs, Mission Hill: may they rest in peace.)

To correct a previous reviewer, and to not confuse potential buyers, the DVD has 9 ""episodes"" that consist of two 15 minute episodes each.

Jhonen Vasquez's brilliant new sci-fi world has devloped a cult following much like many Anime series have. From the animation to the voices, everything about it is top notch. And this time, there won't be any obnoxious ""Nickelodeon"" sign in the corner of the screen.
Invader Zim was canceled in December of 2002 for a few reasons. Many parents sent in letters saying that there was too much dark humor and suggestive themes in it that they felt it was not appropriate for young children to watch. Because most of Nickelodeon's fan base is younger children, they felt compelled to shut down production and chuck the reel into the vault before locking it shut.
However, fans were not going to let it go that eaisly. Realizing that Invader Zim had attracted the attention of adults and teenagers world-wide, they resumed production momentairly before once again, they had to get rid of it.
Fanfiction sprang up all over the net. Anti-Nickelodeon websites were appearing countless times in the google search toolbar. I even remember a few sites that had ""Shrines to Invader Zim"".
Bootlegging happened - Kazaa was being bombarded for downloads of the series. Those who had taped the episodes were now copying the copys and selling them for money off the internet. People were going to almost any lengths to get the series.
Then, one day, I appeared at Amazon.com and saw they were selling Volume 1 of the Invader Zim series. I ordered it at that second.
I promise you, you will not be dissapointed with this animated series. Amazingly well done, each episode is packed with outrageous humor and real life issues brought into the light. Almost every student will be able to relate to having a ""Miss. Bitters"" at least once as their teacher. A heartless, cold ""doom"" infested old woman who teaches Dib and Zim in the school.

2013473,5,B0001LJBTE,"5 STARS!Invader Zim is the most awesome show ever. I seriously don't watch Nick anymore because they cancelled it. I did watch Nick on May second just because they showed one episode on alien invasion day. That was the only show on that special worth watching. When I first saw the commercial's I was really confused because they made no sense at all. But once I saw the show I fell in love with it. It's about a troublesome green alien that get's sent to the unknown planet earth. So Zim was sent there to conquer the planet. Actually they just wanted to get rid of Zim. The reason Nick probably cancelled it is because of the dark humor. And sometime's it can be disturbing like a giant zit exploding. Here's the cast of character's.
Zim:The main character. He has a lot of attitude. His so called mission is to conquer earth. But he has alot of patience since he has to deal with...
Gir:Zim's crazy robot dog. Gir is where most of the humor come's from. He has the IQ of...well...nothing. And he has the attention span of...nothing. Gir's a taco loving,cupcake munching,pig loving freak. Now do you see why he's funny.
Dib:Zim's human enemy. Dib is just a poor,poor boy since almost nobody believes what he ever say's.
Gaz:Her plot through out the whole series is to play video game's and say how much she hate's Dib.
Miss. Bitter's:Miss. Bitter's is zim's bitter ""SKOOL"" teacher.
Scary monkey:Zim and this monkey have some problem's. He is seen a few time's through out the show. The monkey actually is on a T.V. where it just...stare's...at...you. It's Gir's favorite show.
Zim's parent's:Zim's parent's are actually robot's he made to seem human. There kinda creepy.
There are a few more character's but they don't really matter. Zim is compleatly allergic to water. And there is 1 episode based around that. They should have just aired the show on another station. But I'll just wait for the DVD.The reason I said the show can be disturbing is because Zim develope's a huge hypnotic zit named Postulio that control's people by wiggling around. The disturbing part is when postulio explode's and everybody is floating around in zit juice. For some odd reason they have soda called diet poop. I love the episode when Gir take's over the house. There are very little time's when Gir turn's serious but as you were guessing a few second's later he goes back to stupid mode. On the first episode the doom song is so awesome. Well Invader Zim is a drop dead funny show! Well I gotta leave. So listen to Postulio...and buy this DVD.Bye!!!...(...).",1083715200,2,2547,4.6875
2013474,5,B0001LJBTE,"I admit that it took me a while to catch on to Invader Zim. (Partially because it was being aired by Nickelodeon about once a week on Sunday afternoons.) What first drew me in to the series was the absolutely astounding semi-3D computer animation. The characters were (and are) some of the most unique and interesting in cartoon history. The second thing that drew me in (and also the most likely reason the show was cancelled) was its cutting edge ""dark humor"". Similar to other Nick shows like 'Rocko's modern life', (Still waiting for the DVD on that one.) Invader Zim can safely be enjoyed by children, but the real, underlying humor will only be appreciated by teens and adults.
  I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys dark humor, or just great animated TV. Zim truly is one of the greatest series of all time, animated or otherwise.
  And if you like Zim, I REALLY recommend that you check out HBO's sketch comedy series 'Mr. Show', one of, if not THE best show you've never heard of. (That one's just for the adults, though.)

Now, everything about these DVD's is great. High quality, not watermarked (no annoying Nick symbol!) Zim toons along with many special commentary guests and animatics. Since I'm a huge fan on Zim, I naturally enjoyed every bit of it. There's also video interviews with the voice artists who make the voices of Zim, Gir, Gaz, Dib, Tallest Red, and more. Also has the original Pilot episode featuring the voice of Stimpy as Zim.
The only possible bad thing is that the Irken subtitles are set to default and, even when turned off, the following episode plays with the Irken subtitles. If you don't like them, you'll need to change the setting at the start of every episode. I like them, so I have no problem.*
If you love Zim, you'll love these DVD's. Don't buy bootlegs, they're trash compared to this beautiful materpeice of Zim goo. Buy one for every person in your house, for every room in your house. Then get all your friends, relatives and enemies to do the same.

2013476,5,B0001LJBTE,"This is simply one of the finest (and funniest) works of sci-fi to be aired on television, ever.
A lot of mystery revolves around why Nick found the ""wisdom"" to cancel the show, after only one season and a rotating ,illogical time slot .
Here is what I've learned during a recent covention at which Jhonen Vasquez spoke about Invader Zim: during an episode called ""Game Slave 2"", their is a part where Gaz's nemesis in the episode (Igines), is killed falling with an elevator. Nick execs thought that it was horrible having a child die on their network, a family network. To please the censors and to hopefully give a cheeky response to the execs, an epilogue was added of Igines leaping from the broken husk of the elevator and shouting his name with ""IGINES!"" splashed across the top in a victorious manner. This was an ""in your face!"" to Nick execs., who DID GET IT!! Soon after, the show was canceled. (Not directly quoting) Many elements that were suppose to be added later were simply thrown into ""the worst x-mas ever""; (minimoose, Tak's ship, the Massive coming to earth0, all larger story features for other episodes. Condensed down, they actually killed the episode (as well as the brutal chopping it got on the editting floor).
Saddly, an actual story with some meat was beginning to take shape (again, Tak's ship, the Resisty from ""Backseat drivers from beyond the stars"",Invader Skoog joining Zim on Earth and Foodcourtia mentioned in many episodes). As well as a definite final episode (titled ""Invader Dib"" acording to rumor) which woud have brought the everything to a proper end (see TVTOME.COM for further information). None of which will ever be shown. (Some bootlegs do exist of some of these episodes)
 Worse yet, in signing over the rights to Zim, Jhonen lost all creative rights to the charecters that were in the show (luckily Squee or Johnny never cameoed in the show).
I hope this gives some explanation to the whole debate.

2013477,5,B0001LJBTE,"Probably one of the top 5 cartoons of all time. I'm surprised it took Nick so long to release these, as the only reason the series got cancelled was that more adults were watching it than kids. A classic that now will live in infamy in its DVD form.",1082764800,,249,4.1020408163265305
2013478,5,B0001LJBTE,"A little over two years ago, a little cartoon named Invader Zim premired on Nickelodeon. Then, just as the show had developed a large fanbase, Nick cancelled it. Think that's the end of the story?
Fear not, IZ Fantaics, your time as come! Zim is finally available on DVD! If you never have heard of Zim, here's a newbie's Cliff Notes: Invader Zim is about an alien named, you guessed it, Zim. With a megalomaniac personality that makes up for his short stature, Zim isn't exactly in the Top Ten of the Almight Tallest's (Zim's advisors) favorite invaders list. After nearly ruining Operation Impending Doom I, OID II is underway and Zim wants a slice of the pie. But the Tallests have other plans. In order to get rid of Zim (and having OID II go smoothly), they send him to an unknown planet called Earth (which they themselves have no idea who, or what, inhabits it) on a ""special misson"". Being complete blind to the Tallets' true nature of this ""mission"", Zim happily accepts and decends to Earth, in hopes of completing OID II and pleasing the Tallests.
Along with Zim, you get a colorful cast that includes GIR, an ""advanced"" robot that has garbage for brains (literally) and acts like a two year old on a sugar high. Dib, Zim's antagonist, is a kid who is an inpiring paranormal investigator and will stop at nothing to prove of Zim's exsistance and plans to take over Earth. Gaz, Dib's younger sister and sometimes partner, just wants to be left alone and go about her daily way of life and Miss Bitters, Dib's teacher at ""SKOOL"", who main priority is to crush children's dreams and be blunt of the ""evils"" of life in general.
Why take notice? For one, Zim's creator, Jhonen Vasquez, is the brillent, twisted genius behind the popular comics Johnny the Homacidel Manaic, SQUEE! and I Fell Sick (which have already a large fanbase). Plus, it still amazes me that this is a kid's show. While most children's shows are just carbon copies from yesterday and beyond, Zim brakes the mold by portraying childhood as a dark, disturbing period of a person's life that involves odd and random humor, jabs at how society has gone downhill since the 1980s (maybe even earlier than that given time period), and how one must deal with everything inbetween...all through the eyes of an alien, a robot, two kids and a bitter old woman.
This, I believe, is why many have grasped on to this show. Truly a cult classic, it's no surprize that the IZ DVD will included a nice, heeping helping of much anticipated bonus features, including commentaries from the show staff and actors, the orginal pilot that gave way to show, and many more. Plus, all the episodes are uncut and edited according to Jhonen's true vision, which promises to please all IZ fans alike.
If you are a fan (like myself), then this is a must-buy and a perfect addition to add to your DVD collection. If you are not, give the show a go and discover what all the excitment is about. You'll never look at cartoons the same why again once you have gotten a taste of Invader Zim.",1082246400,14,3034,4.579044117647059

While it is much darker than many children's cartoons, it is not overly excessive in violence. I am a huge Jhonen Vasquez fan and I believe this is something anyone who enjoys his works should own.
If you have never read any of Jhonen Vasquez's work, this is a good starting point. His unique visual style is unforgetable and modern. Not only do his drawing catch the eye, his uniquely dark characters and stories will keep the reader, or in this case watcher, enthralled. This is the most light, least depressing and violent of his works. If you do enjoy Jhonen Vasquez, Roman Dirge is another great writer.

When I found out that it was coming out on DVD (Only like a month ago), I almost cried with joy. This is truly a wonderful TV show, animated or not, and it's finally getting the attention it deserves. Zim, the overly determined and somewhat crazy invader who just wants to prove himself worthy in a world where he is isolated, can be compared to many of us who are just trying to make our mark on the world. Gir, the lovable and fun-loving little robot, is like the child that lives within each of us. Dib's obsessive beliefs and theories relate to the things that we try to hold on to in the chaos we call reality. And Gaz is the anti-social, shadow-loving girl who we can relate to on really annoying days when people won't leave us alone.",1081036800,2,899,4.2631578947368425

2013490,4,B0001LJBTE,"Reading the other reviews will give you the plot, but there's several other things about Invader ZIM that it's helpful to know.  It's fairly dark and satirical, with at least one plot about stolen internal organs.  It's also some of the most wildly imaginative stuff I've seen in a while, both in terms of plotlines (in one episode, Earth has been stolen, and ZIM must retrieve it so that he can conquer it himself!) and the technology.  The visual style, especially of the Irken settings, is so cohesive and distinctive that creator Jhonen Vasquez won a place in the National Design Triennial for it.  No skimping on the backgrounds or details here!
A couple of things that might put some people off:  The series is very morally ambiguous.  Neither ZIM nor his archnemesis Dib are really the good guy or the bad guy, which might bother some parents of smaller kids.  Also, a personal peeve is that a lot of the humor relies on sheer randomness.  One of Jhonen's overall concept of ZIM was to take the most inane stuff he could imagine (and if you know his comics work, you know that can stretch the limits of the current definitions of inanity--Happy Noodle Boy, anyone?) and treat it as dramatically as possible.  Some of the scenes, especially the endings, will sometimes leave you thinking ""huh?  what the---why?!?""
Beyond the series itself, the DVDs will contain many extras, at least some from a list Jhonen himself gave MediaBlasters.  They say that to get the most extras, you will have to get the box set that will be released after the DVDs.  Also helpful to know.

2013491,5,B0001LJBTE,"Every aspect of this show is great!  The show was very origional and hilarious.  Every episode had it's own special composed music by Kevin Manthei, with quite a few songs per episode for background music.  The art style is really cool, and unlike any other cartoon you'll ever see.  You will see some funny antics of characters and some cool 3D sequences that will amaze you and make you think, wow this is too good to be a show, each episode is so detailed that it's like a mini movie! And if you find an episode has a not so appealing plot, you will still find yourself drawn to the great colorful artwork done by the talented ZiM staff!
So definately buy this DVD, you will find that the whole set will earn a nice spot by your TV and never shall it collect dust for you won't be able to stop watching it!",1078444800,,809,4.233766233766234

2013497,5,B0001LJBTE,"The Irken are a mighty race of tall aliens slowly conquering the planets.  Invader Zim hails from planet Irk, and though small, he's a veteran of Operation Impending Doom (and the reason OID was a failure).  Sent to conquer planet Earth because it's really far away from Irk, Zim sets up a base and trys to do his part for Operation Impending Doom 2.  Aiding his effort is Gir, his ""advanced"" robot sidekick.  Although Gir was intended to aid Zim in his conquering efforts, his strengths lie in his ability to watch lots and lots of television and carry objects in his head.
As Zim and Gir do silly things to try and destroy the Earth, there's only one boy who notices Zim's an alien and constantly tries to defeat him.  Dib is the son of a great scientist, obsessed with the paranormal, and if any of Zim's schemes come close to succeeding, Dib will find a way to stop it (Dib doesn't really have any friends or anything else to do).
Also fun to watch are Gaz, Dib's sister who doesn't like anything that interferes with her reading or video gaming, and Ms. Bitters, the evil teacher everyone has had to deal with in their journey through ""skool"".
NOTE: This review is being written months before the DVD release, the show is just that good.  It's not being shown on tv anymore, so this is your only chance to witness the impending doom.

On the first Impending Doom mission, Zim got ""carried away"" in one of the Mega Doomers and trashed the barracks, destroying most of it, and that being done he was banished. But a while later after the place was re-built, Invaders come from all over to see if they passed their training test to be given a mission with Impending Doom 2. He harasses his bosses until he is given a planet to invade, until finally the bosses come up with a plan. They send him on a ""secret mission"" to nowhere, to get rid of him... obviously unknown to Zim. With his wacky, yet cute SIR Unit, (made out of junk...

Dib and Gaz are the only humans who know about him... but Earth has nothing to worry about... Zim stinks at invading.
