934224,5,6304749546,"This television show was a great family program with a lot of heart. This DVD contains two Christmas Episodes. They will tug a bit at your heart because they are very sentimental. This comedy/drama was a very good television show and was worth the price of the DVD to see it again!!
If you're a fan of the show, buy this DVD and if you're not- you should be!!
It is a simple DVD and although the audio is in Stereo it still sounds good.
I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of the show!!!!!",1004227200,7,492,4.135416666666667
934225,5,6304749546,"When I first saw an episode of the Wonder Years, I didn't connect with it much.  I thought it was a show for kids, one that didn't have much bearing on me.  As I watched it more, especially on Nick at Nite when there was nothing else on, I began to realize that this show was unique.  Not only did it appeal to younger audiences with its light-hearted humor, but that it even appealed to middle to late teenagers like me, with its displays of Kevin's relationships, his feelings, and his growth as a person.  This show deals with practically every difficulty that adolescents must face, from strange parents to changing friends.  It is rare that a show has actually been able to reach out and touch my heart, but it seems that this show is able to do it whenever I watch it.  My only wish was that they had the entire series available, so that I could watch it from start to finish.",997315200,8,882,4.315151515151515

934228,5,6304749546,"Christmas at the Arnold House isn't full of merriment in both of these  episodes. In the 1968 episode where Kevin was in junior high, the family is  trying to convince their dad to buy a color TV.Kevin is also trying to find  the perfect present for Winnie. It is a bittersweet episode as Kevin  remembers about Winnie's older brother, Brian, who died that past year. The  high school episode is about how Kevin's father deals with running his own  furniture shop and taking a risk by leaving his old job. Kevin also tries  again to find the perfect present for Winnie. Isn't that cute! These episodes  will make you laugh, cry, and relive old Christmases.",965001600,15,656,4.643478260869565

934316,5,6304749546,John D.Seneca is right to be slightly hysterical in his praise for this wonderful DVD. Far more than just an ideal Christmas present - I watch this DVD every day of the year. Fred Savage's performance as Kevin Arnold is a joy to behold.,1132012800,,236,4.386363636363637

934318,2,6304749546,"I bought this Christmas Special when it was first released
on VHS, just in time for the holidays. It was a present for
my brother, who is as sincere a fan of the show as I am.
Although the compilation did bring back great memories of
The Wonder Year's Christmas, I was kind of hoping for more
content. The episodes (2 Christmas specials) were great!
But if you are looking for a 'Best of' or full seasons,
then you are probably better off waiting. This DVD only got
watched ONCE by my brother. If you are looking for a good
Christmas gift, this one won't hold up under the tree.",1071619200,17,578,4.263636363636364
934319,5,6304749546,"I was kind of disappointed when I found out that they left the ""A Very Cutlip Christmas"" episode off this dvd. No offense to the other two great shows, I just think that one captured the essence of Christmas to perfection. The quality of the dvd is much better then the ""Best Of"" dvd that was released to promote the show and the two Christmas episodes are filled with bittersweet remembrance and the nostalgia that creeps around during the holiday season. Still, the greatest show of my lifetime with integrity that will never fade away.",1068076800,,538,4.673684210526316

This episodes wasn't showed on my country when the show was released so that's why I bought it.
A good prize for the Dvd plus a nice menu good sound and good quality on the transfer depite is from the late 80's the broadcast.

934322,5,6304749546,"You know we have seen all the Disney movies, all the Disney cartoons and there's more I guess but only in this series have I felt like it was about Our Wonder Years- my wonder years, if you will. Every episode touches on the littlest if not trivial but precious parts of my memory and heart as a 12 year old back then.  I guess it hits me the most cause the story approximates the time when I was that age too - the moon landing and the like
I cant remember what episode that was, any way I'd like to say that this is the best series I've seen dealing with this time in a young man's journey to adulthood.  To all who were involved in making the series I say -- to Kevin and all...  ""ITS THE BEST !!! Good Work !!!  Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold was perfect for the part. The nuances in his acting were just great. And oh I remember another good series which just disappeared - titled  ""James at 15"" it was also good!",1020729600,4,915,4.033149171270718

7878274,5,6304749546,"Excellent series. I thought it would have been available on DVD boxed sets for each season by now. Someone mentioned legal hangup about music intellectual property concerns. I bought a DVD ""best of"" shortly after I bought my first DVD player. Had no idea that more of the same is NOT yet available. ""My Father's Office"" hits too close to home. The episode starts off with brothers Kevin and Wayne discussing potential career goals with their friends. ""I want to be centerfielder for the Giants. Fallback position, quarterback"". Conversation turns to what each kid's father does. ""My dad has a better paying job than yours."" Kevin know that Jack Arnold works for the defense/Aerospace company NORCOM, as Manager of Product Distribution and Support in North America. But, Kevin innocently asks, ""What does that mean?"" Seeking a better understanding of what Dad's job entails,young Kevin asks him, ""Dad, what do you do at work?"". Dad's brutally honest reply, ""I shovel other people's <excrement> all day so you can eat."" In a pre-cursor to ""take your kid to work day"", Kevin takes the day off from school and tags along with Dad during the work day. We observe highlights such as: the importance of the coffee break, Dad taking the blame for incompetent sub-ordinates, and other memorable office politics that hit WAY to close to home. Most memorable, Kevin asking ""When you were growing up, did you want to be Manager of Product Development and Support in North America?"" Jack explains to Kevin that sometimes dreams don't come true. Reality sets in. He met Kevin's mom, she got pregnant, they bought a house. Dad's comment to Kevin, ""I don't think we've done that bad."" Certainly, it's worth it to wait for an official DVD/Blue ray release of this quality content. I've seen an offering of ALL episodes for the price of only $49.95; no doubt, not officially licensed product. Anyone care to comment about the quality of the bogus product?",1230768000,,1937,4.908536585365853
