It's a good costume drama and has excellent actors, such as Michael Gambon, in starring roles. It's definitely a woman's movie.

If you love Jane Austen you will be disappointed by these characters, I'm afraid. I'm very partial to Austen's heroines. But if you like period British drama, this is worth watching.",1501891200,,461,4.910256410256411
