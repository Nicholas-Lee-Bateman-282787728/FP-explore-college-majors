8297831,5,B001ED3JL4,"It must be about sixty one years since I saw the Range Busters films on BBC television on a twelve inch television screen with a large magnifying glass hung over the set to make the image larger.
I really enjoyed those screenings on Children's Hour television, so I was glad of the opportunity of seeing them again.
I don't remember any of the stories except for the one based on the historical character Black Bart. I think the series would appeal to my generation out of nostalgia and maybe to a younger audience, but all the films are in Black and white which was the standard at the time for B budget cowboy films. Also todays children have been brought up on a diet of violent and amoral films and games.
The copies are very poor in at least two cases. This is very often the case with old films which were not cared for, or just simply lost.
The original cast  worked well. Ray Crash Corrigan, John Dusty King and Max Terhune with his ventriloquist's doll Elmer, are entertaining The stories were well written but because the films were made on a very low budget some short scenes were used in subsequent films.",1379376000,2,1117,4.4754901960784315
8297832,5,B001ED3JL4,"When Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan turned Simi Valley, California, property he owned into an all-purpose movie ranch (Corriganville), all he had to do to get to work every morning was step outside his front door. No battling crowded freeways like the rest of us.
Next door was a saloon, hotel, bank, cafe, general store, blacksmith shop, and livery stable, no phony false-front buildings, either, but the real deal with special windows to accomodate motion picture cameras. The saloon and hotel were full-operational sound stages.
Some 3000 t0 3500 movies were filmed on the 2000-acre ranch. A special lake was constructed for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" a western fort was built for ""Fort Apache."" When he opened the place to the public in 1949, he added an arena for rodeos and speciak events.
Movie and TV actors performed live in bank hold-ups, jailbreaks, and street shootouts, great fun for them, awesome entertainment for the rest of us. But the biggest attraction of all was Corrigan himself, the nicest man ever to step down off a tall horse to give an awestruck little boy an autograph.",1359417600,5,1091,4.934782608695652
