7005194,2,B00TEC7K62,Not what I expected.,1427241600,,20,4.25
7005195,2,B00TEC7K62,The film was too slow in trying to get an emotional effect and low on factual background for such a long program.,1427068800,,113,4.181818181818182
7005196,4,B00TEC7K62,"I have questions about Andrew Jarecki, but I have no doubt about the quality of this true crime miniseries. Who is Andrew Jarecki? A smart, wealthy kid, really. He co-founded Movifone and never has to work in a real job ever again. But he has a knack for making true crime documentaries (Capturing the Freemans and now this). He has made Robert Durst his 10-year obsession. First, he produced and directed the forgettable drama All Good Things (2006), which was based on the disappearance of Robert Durst's wife, Kathleen McCormack, in 1982. But then Jarecki more than made-up for that Tribeca Film Festival filler by embarking on a 6-year (my estimate) project to make The Jinx, an early Emmy Awards favorite, and one of the best true crime documentaries to ever be shown on US television.

Jarecki has a knack of appearing objective, impartial and trustworthy with his subjects. But from the way the film is edited and packaged, it is clear that he sees Robert Durst as a man who has gotten away with murder at least twice (and likely thrice). It is an impressive tightrope to walk, and a stark contrast to the way in which Sarah Koenig directed the first Serial podcast. In the first season of Serial, Sarah Koenig brought a unique storytelling style to a medium that was arguably dying - the podcast. Keeping her presentation casual, and extending the story presentation over 2 months, she was playing a dual role of both journalist and interested observer. She also had more theories and leads to deal with than Jarecki, and a shorter amount of time (1 year) to collect, edit, and present them. And she also had an opinion - she wanted to learn that Adnan Sayed did not commit murder. Koenig succeeded at almost everything she set out to do, except find a convincing piece of evidence to truly break new ground in the story. To her credit, Koenig didn't promise that. Plus, Serial is really an extension of the conversational-style, audio-only format of This American Life, limited by its medium - the audio-only format. The Jinx not only breaks new ground in its story, but being a film, it has serious visceral impact when the twists are revealed.

In short, Andrew Jarecki got lucky and Sara Koenig didn't, and the results pretty much speak for themselves. Robert Durnst approached Jarecki after seeing All Good Things, which presents Durst's character as a murderer. That alone is extraordinary. Add the fact that Jarecki, like Durst, has lived in the shadow of his father, and it makes The Jinx all the more extraordinary. It's not just a portrait of Durst, but of Jarecki himself.",1427068800,,2591,4.78125

7005200,5,B00TEC7K62,"Spellbinding unraveling of so many mysteries and a close study of what appears to be a psychopath.  Haven't sat through four such intense hours in my lifetime.  What is missing is a close examination of his childhood through college years and I do hope at some point that information will be forthcoming.  His family has never, ever been straightforward or helpful and now is the time.",1426636800,3,385,4.803030303030303
7005201,5,B00TEC7K62,"One of the most thrilling, chilling and riveting documentaries ever to grace HBO - and that is saying something given that HBO is one of the great champions of documentary cinema!  Chapter by chapter (there are 6 - each approximately 45 minutes long) the most extraordinary and frankly unbelievable story evolves.  It is almost Shakespearean in scale and is absolutely so in dramatic content.  Just when you think you have sized up what you believe and what you don't, the next chapter turns you on your ear and delivers more extraordinary, gruesome and head shaking revelations - right up until the final seconds.  The phrase truth is stranger than fiction has never been more apropos than in the The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst!  @kmptop10",1426636800,29,755,4.8671875

Kudos to Andrew and Marc for getting to the bottom of these crimes with a single piece of paper. Clever and ballsy fellas. They did in 8 years what 3 states D.A.'s haven't been able to do in 30 years, get a confession. ""BEVERLEY HILLS"" ""there it is."".... ""What the hell did I do?...killed them all, of course.""

7005235,5,B00TEC7K62,"Im sure a lot you out there met at least someone in your life similar to Robert Durst. Im talking about that guy thats been arrested a few times, several car accidents, and a few restraining orders against this individual. Yet, this individual has a CONVENIENT excuse for each event and tries to pass himself off as the victim. This kind of individual takes advantage of your good hearted nature to be sympathetic of others, so you start to believe that the individual is just the most unluckiest person you met. I have a person that comes to mind right away when I think of Robert Durst. Ironically, that person also goes by the similar name Bobby.

The documentary was well done and extremely strategized. The documentary clearly established that Robert Durst is a pathological liar and will say anything to anyone just to avoid the truth. His family are not good people either from the way they handled Kathies disappearence, so its clealry evident that the apple didn't fall far from the tree.

Watched this via HBO GO app and once I started the first episode, I couldn't stop watching until I was done with the last. Im happy that I read he is now in jail awaiting his trial for the murder of Susan Berman. The world is better off with people like Robert Durst behind bars.

Im giving lots of credits to the filmmakers. They did a fantastic job here. Im anxiously awaiting their next documentary. Exposing Robert Durst is also raising awareness and educating people about future Robert Dursts out there. My condolences to his victims. I hope his victims finds peace and may they be blessed from now on with only happiness and success.",1511481600,2,1639,4.664359861591696
7005236,5,B00TEC7K62,"Ok, so I watched the movie with Ryan Gosling (All Good Things) and was slightly confused.  I remembered hearing something about this documentary on The Today Show so I convinced my husband to watch it with me. This documentary was much better than the movie All Good Things. It cleared up A LOT of things that the movie managed to make confusing.  The entire movie is like watching a train wreck- I couldn't turn my head. Robert Durst is one of the weirdest individuals on the planet and this documentary shows the world a new level of weirdness not readily seen in the natural world.

Without Durst's family being as notorious as they are/were, we wouldn't have been able to see this fascinating story.",1511049600,,703,4.653225806451613

7005258,5,B00TEC7K62,"Absolutely stunning! The end got me, but you could tell the whole time he was lying because of the eyes and the physical reactions.  The abnormal blinking,  squinting,  scratching, and burping.  It is a clear sign.  For Forensics in college,  we had to watch videos of known criminals telling a story.  We had to tell by their body language if they were lying or hiding something about the story.  He was such a textbook case,  it was difficult not to shout out at the television that the director was speaking to a pathological liar. So interesting to watch!",1498780800,,559,4.622448979591836

7005265,5,B00TEC7K62,Seriously one of the most exciting HBO documentaries I've watched in a long time.  Bought this just so my dad could see it. He's hard to please but was glued to the TV... we finished this in 2 nights.,1493856000,,200,4.128205128205129
7005266,5,B00TEC7K62,Good,1492473600,,4,4.0
7005267,5,B00TEC7K62,"Although my favorite true crime series remains How to Make a Murderer, I have to say that The Jinx brings a much more interesting form of storytelling to the table in that the reenactments and the opening credits (which is pretty much a montage of the reenactments) are so visually striking. And the twists that come in the last two or three episodes absolutely cannot be imagined if you are not familiar with the case. If you are familiar, it'll still provide some thoroughly entertaining viewing.

Like so many of these true crime documentaries, there's a lot of information that's left out, and although I won't take off any stars for it, I have to say it's imperative that -- assuming you watch the whole show -- you hit up Wikipedia and use that as a jumping off point to find articles and additional reading on the case. As presented, The Jinx is the story of one man with lots of bad luck...who turns out to be a lot more than what he seems in that first episode. But the true story, the stuff you don't see in this documentary, adds even more layers to the proceedings, which I love. Some people want the story to be complete, and if you're that person, you'll end up finding this show lacking...but I can't think of a case where that's not going to happen. If you want the big picture and then want to dig deeper later on, this is stylish, thrilling story that proves real life is stranger than fiction.",1492300800,,1412,4.4517374517374515
7005268,5,B00TEC7K62,"The privileges money can buy in our society are staggering.  This man is a sociopath, he feels no pain that isn't his.  Cameras reveal him in the raw, stalking a brother he has promised to murder, violating a protective order. And in the end, his inadvertent admittance that he killed them all.

You cannot take your eyes off of this man as he speaks. He is a study in dysfunction.  His money buys him women who facilitate his every move and provide him with alibis.  And he ends up killing at least one of them.

This documentary showcases a man that is so mentally incompetent that he mass murders, yet is very rich and can function well enough to have in place, protections that have kept him free for decades.",1491523200,,713,4.446153846153846

7005288,5,B00TEC7K62,"I bought this series from Amazon after watching the entire series on HBO!!  Maybe a foolish purchase but there is something about this seemingly meek man who is able to hide the monster that lurks within.  IMHO the series was very well done and one sure can't blame his brother for hiring a body guard!!!  The real point of this series I feel is that Durst had a compulsion to confess; an ""accident"" I don't think so...  Love the story but I think a forensic psychologist could sit with him for hours and probably be unable to figure him out.

Glad he will no longer be among us; his late wife seemed a very nice person; as a matter of fact all of his victims had a right to live.  Anyway, in California life in prison means life!  Susan Berman was a tragic figure who was trying so hard to sell herself as a daughter of a third string wise guy and Hollywood just wasn't in the buying mood I guess.  Durst was a foolish person who exposed himself to these interviews; any of my past crimes would be kept quite if I did anything so extreme.  A sick man.",1484784000,3,1052,4.22
7005289,5,B00TEC7K62,"I never thought a documentary could have a better conclusion than ""Imposter"" until I watched ""The Jinx"". As an avid watcher of documentary films (especially crime docs), I've seen quite a few that I thought were exceptionally well done.  This one, for me, tops that list.
I read the reviews before watching so I had somewhat of an insight as to what the end result was going to be but was still very shocked, nonetheless, at the way it all transpired.
It is solely because of this film we were able to witness an undeniable, accidental confession to several crimes that, otherwise, would have never been evidently proven.  Andrew Jarecki is fantastic",1484524800,,650,4.794642857142857

I could barely stomach the ""wah-wah"" of the second episode and stopped there.  I've known people with far worse childhoods, rendered parentless and cast into adulthood without a dime to their names manage to make it through life without killing a single person.  I knew someone remarkably like him who killed four people and spent the rest of his life lamenting his tough childhood -- which was nowhere near as tough as the childhoods he gave to his own children.  Since justice could not be served in the system, it would at least have been nice to not further coddle this monster by giving him a voice.  To rip off Thoreau, most victims' loved ones ""lead lives of quiet desperation"" for the remainder of their lives.  The fact that the general public is interested in criminals and not victims is what is resulting in so many mass shootings -- the shooters know that their crimes will get them the attention they so desperately want, and we give it to them in spades.  Shame on us.  All that said, I fully admit I stopped partway into the second episode.after his interview started, with the primary focus on his childhood.  There are other things that can come from trauma -- such as empathy and setting a goal to not inflict pain on others.  Durst is not jinxed -- he IS the jinx.",1480636800,,1459,4.66015625

Not only is the story utterly unbelievable, but this doc tells it in the most compelling way, with incredible access, editing, very tasteful reenactments, a beautiful haunting score and a transition from a telling of past events into an ongoing investigation that completely took my breath away. As often as things are described as heart pounding and jaw dropping, the ending of this documentary really is both of those things in a way nothing I've ever seen is. I keep rewatching the whole thing, I can't believe how good it is and I can't get the story out of my head.

I love that I can download videos I purchase to my Kindle Fire, so I don't need data to view them in the car.  Frequently before a trip, I will purchase a series I haven't seen yet, so I can watch it as I travel.

This was not a disappointment.  I actually knew very little about the story before viewing, and I was fascinated to watch this very wealthy black sheep seem to get away with multiple murders.  His eccentric behavior and willingness to court those making the documentary as if in a game of cat and mouse was so interesting, and it was unbelievable to me how much he really seemed to need the attention.  The ending, which I know is a spoiler that most have heard before, left me with mouth agape!  Great viewing.",1471392000,,821,4.191082802547771

The story IS amazing and frightening, and this documentary style show let you get a really good up close personal look at the man himself. He was definitely the main ""character"", and the editors did a good job of keeping the story in line and including as much detail as possible.
The only thing I thought was odd was the opening credits - intro.  It seemed really artsy and out there, and then the documentary itself was very straightforward.  It just seemed like an odd presentation.
Interesting watch for sure.

Kathy, from what all her friends said would probably have eventually become his best friend. So you have to feel really bad for this guy, traumatized as a kid seeing his mohter's suicide.....he seemed like he had a disassociative disorder. Like talking to himself was like two conflicted people in there. I think his family knows he killed his wife. I don't understand why now, already sick and not long for this world will he not give her poor family peace and say ""I'm sorry. I did it. It was a crime of passion, I loved her and didn't want her to leave me""....Like his mother had left him, she may have brought up all those old feelings. If he admitted it way back, he could have afforded an attorney to get him into a great psychiatric place for a while where he could have learned to live with the anguish and not spend his life tossed in the wind trying to run away.

So unfortunately I already knew the outcome. But that didn't matter, cuz the way the six episodes unfold is so crazy, I was more and more on the edge of my seat after each ep. It starts off as a simple, somewhat casual story for the filmmakers. As we discover more about Durst's history, the crew becomes more and more directly involved in revealing critical details concerning the accusations against him. We jump back and forth through decades of events and circumstances, and Jarecki lays out each piece of the story at just the right moment in the series. Jarecki said his intention was to bring audiences into the same journey his team went through while producing and investigating this series. I can say he definitely succeeded in that regard.

Other documentaries very similar to The Jinx in quality and topic would be Capturing the Friedmans (also directed by Jarecki), The Thin Blue Line, and Making a Murderer. The Jinx stands up there with the best of the best true crime docs.",1452556800,,1144,4.807106598984771

Much like an ambient riff that functions well as work music, it serves a purpose, but to elevate it to greatness is generous in the least. If we're talking recent docs, ""Magician..."" (on Welles) and ""If You Build It"" are far superior. By the last episode, I just wanted it to end, and while the payoff is a good though completely unsurprising one, that hardly justified the entirety of the previous thematically repetitive episodes. It didn't.

The inherent ""looking at the wreck as you drive by"" energy of Durst's psychopathy should not be confused with good movie-making. This could -- and should -- have easily been a 100 minute feature - why it was a mini-series is beyond me.",1451520000,2,795,4.802919708029197

Over the years I've watched several forensics shows on Bobby Durst and was only 90% certain he killed his first wife, less so about his best friend and, regarding his neighbor- well maybe not. Bobby Durst has got to be the most unaffected, unassuming, unlikely murderer- though, Michael Peterson is certainly in that situation too. NOTE: don't confuse Michael Peterson with SCOTT Peterson! Durst's sociopathic behavior lacks the bombast of more ""typical"" sociopathic killers, for example, a Ted Bundy. You might even feel sympathy for the guy. Then he gets caught stealing a sub (sandwich- not boat!)- I mean how can you not get a guffaw out of that incredible act of stupidity? If you want to watch a documentary about a serial killer that is not the typical ""dry"" facts dispensed in a linear fashion like on a forensics TV show, you might find this documentary more watchable- even entertaining. I won't spoil the shocking conclusion (if you don't read about it in other reviews) because it's another act of incredible stupidity on Bobby's part.",1450396800,,1192,4.905940594059406

7005585,4,B00TEC7K62,"Excellent. 2 DVD's, each with three episodes delving into the life of this most enigmatic man, Robert Durst.

Robert Durst, a name many of of us may have tucked away in the recesses of our minds as we heard it on a news story or read it in a headline somewhere. Delve a little deeper though and there's a somewhat sad, lonely, misunderstood man who's life started to cave in very early on after, at age 7, he witnessed his mother's suicide.

The entire Documentary pretty much came about at Durst's own request when he contacted Andrew Jarecki, the director of a movie named ""All good things"" based on Robert Durst. Durst wanted to sit down and be interviewed by Jarecki in an attempt to get his side of things across. Jarecki started things somewhat neutral towards Durst and gave him a LOT of latitude in his questions. Interspersed with Durst's interview are other players in the saga giving their points and offering evidence in direct contradiction to the words coming out of Durst's mouth.

Jarecki never seems to get down under the first layer of Durst. Durst, always referring to himself in 2nd or 3rd person, retains his unemotional posture and explains, matter-of-factly, the disappearance of his first wife, the murder of his good friend and the murder of his neighbor, all of whom Durst has been charged and found guilty of by the court of public opinion.

Jarecki and Durst seem to be wrapping the whole thing up when one of his victim's son finds the most damning piece of evidence and presents it to Jarecki. Up to this point the son had been a staunch supporter of Durst. Jarecki presents the evidence to Durst who, again, matter-of-factly, brushes it aside with only a sleight show of emotion.

This is where the documentary naturally ends ... but it doesn't. Without spoiling things, the last 2 to 3 minutes of this documentary are the most eerily and weird thing I've witnessed.

Summary: 4 to 5 hours of the most compelling video I've watched in a long time about an enigmatic, isolated man named Robert Durst. Sociopath? Schizoid ? Misunderstood? Hard to tell as Durst lets no one in. The timeline is unraveled for us at a good pace and all comments from the players are on point. Definitely worth your time.",1443484800,,2229,4.673469387755102

7005587,3,B00TEC7K62,"I'd read rave reviews of this documentary but found it to be fair to midling. The main character is such a reprehensible person, I hardly think he's worth the multi-part treatment of this film. Well researched and produced, with a zinger ending but I think it could have been handled in an hour.",1443052800,,295,4.584905660377358
7005588,1,B00TEC7K62,"I imagine most people purchasing this series have already seen it on HBO.  It's a fascinating portrait of New York real estate heir and triple murderer Robert Durst.  Great research, great story telling.  But this is a review of the blu ray...which is completely devoid of special features.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, no additional insights, surprising especially considering Durst's arrest the night before the airing of the finale.  Or...maybe not.  With so many unanswered questions clearly HBO has legal concerns with Durst now that he is charged with murder in LA.  And there are a lot of questions about the timeline on the interviews with Durst.  Basically, Jarecki sat on the ""killed them all of course"" interview from the finale for some time before notifying the authorities...or did he?  This isn't clear.  I still wonder if a deal was made to not arrest Durst until the finale was about to air in exchange for police/DA access the filmmaker's raw materials.  The timing of the whole thing is hard to believe.  Which of course raises a whole raft of journalistic issues...which the average viewer may not be interested in.  But I was hoping this set might answer or at least address a few of these issues.  I also have to say, I find Jarecki's assertion in the final episode that he ""wasn't sure"" if Durst was guilty hard to swallow.  Anyone who has seen ""All Good Things"" would have a hard time believing the filmmakers were at all in doubt about Durst's role in the deaths of his wife, and his two friends.  Durst clearly believed Jarecki was open to the possibility that he was innocent...but I don't buy it.  And I'd have more respect for him if he just owned up to using Durst's trust and narcissism to manipulate him into an prolonged interview and ditch this nonsense about thinking he might not be guilty.  Again, most people won't particularly care if Jarecki et al are being disingenuous here and fooled a murderer into talking with him...but it does raise journalistic concerns that would have been interesting to explore in the features.  But again, given the open case in California, not that surprising that this is a bare bones release.  So by all means pick it up as long as you're not expecting any further incite into the case or into Jarecki's process.",1442880000,2,2290,4.7639593908629445

7005641,5,B00TEC7K62,"If there is a book or film on Bob Durst and/or Susan Berman I don't have, I can't understand how I missed it.  You can see from my Profile that I have commented on numerous books on the subject.

As mentioned before in previous reviews, I was a media transcriber the last ten years of my working career.  I worked for the two premier transcription houses in NYC from 1997 to 2008.  One of the many thousands of stories I transcribed over the years was the re-opening of the missing person case of Kathie Durst.  I remembered the story back in 1982 when her face was on the front page of every tabloid paper in Manhattan. Over the years, like everyone else not connected to the story, I forgot about it.  Then, many years later, there it was again.  And I was transcribing the taped interviews.  I started buying every book on the subject that amazon.com had.  And, over the years, I have acquired them all.

Then, along comes THE JINX, the HBO spectacathon by Andrew Jarecki.

Of course I saw ALL GOOD THINGS when it came out (See my review on amazon) and thought Ryan Gosling incredibly sensitive and fascinating in the role.  However, Gosling does not have the abrasive, Al Pacino-sounding voice that Bob Durst has.  I can imagine Bob Durst was delighted with the choice of Gosling to play him when he watched the film in a local NYC theater.  He called Andrew Jarecki after seeing it and the rest is history.  Sort of.

No author in the history of American literature could have made this story up with the cast of characters that inhabit the tale. If someone had written Bob Durst's life story as a fiction book no publisher would touch it. They would dismiss it as too far fetched to be believed by readers. And they would be right in thinking this.

In this documentary it is obvious that Bob Durst is physically ill.  He is a shadow of his former self.  He shuffles (walks) like a 90 year old man.  He talks to himself...out loud.  His face is a taut mask pulled tightly on his skull.  He just appears quite ill.

The production team has acquired family video of Bob Durst with his late mother when he was a young boy.  He was 7 when she fell or threw herself off the roof of the family home.  Durst talks about being at her funeral and watching them lower her coffin into the grave.  When someone tells him it's his mother inside the box he screams, ""I don't want mommy in a box.  Get mommy out of the box.""  As he sits at the table with Jarecki re-telling the traumatic story he becomes the 7 year old before our eyes.  It is gut-wrenching to look at and your eyes fill with tears at the thought of any child enduring this.  Tragic as it was, it is no excuse for what he is supposed to have done over the following years.  Murder three people.

The interview is riveting.  The scenes from the murder trial in Galveston, Texas nail you to the back of your chair.  There is footage of his brother Doug talking about how he fears for his life and has hired bodyguards.  Footage of his wife Deborah. She comes off as a hard cookie.  Nothing soft of feminine about her.  She is all business.  She hesitates when asked the date of her marriage to Durst.  It is embarrassing to watch because it is so obvious this was a business relationship, not a love match.  Of course there is no mention of Bob's affair with Mia Farrow's sister, Prudence, which Kathie found out about and sent her reeling.  It was the beginning of the end of their marriage.

He hires the two best lawyers in Texas and is acquitted of Morris Black's murder.  The look on his face when the verdict is read is priceless.  They cost him well over a million dollars but it was worth it.  He is again a free man.  Well, not quite.

There are the murder cases of his wife and best friend Susan Berman to consider.  New York State prosecutors have never given up on charging him in Kathie's death, although her body was never found.  His best friend since college, Susan Berman, is found murdered in her California home a day after the Beverly Hills Police receive a letter with the words 'cadaver' written on the paper along with Susan's address.  The word Beverly is spelled Beverley on the envelope.  And, yes, Bob Durst was in California at the time of her death.

Susan Berman knows where all the bodies are buried with regard to Bob's life story.  She was his spokes person to the press after Kathie went missing. She has kept all his secrets all these years.  However, time and reality have caught up with her.  She is living in LA and broke. Not able to land a job in the media that would keep her in the lifestyle she has always lived, she borrows thousands of dollars from a list of friends.  The list is shown in the documentary.  Printed from her personal computer after her death.  Bob Durst-$50,000.  This is the amount he has given her in recent months before her death.  One day she receives a call from the Attorney Generals office in NY asking if they could send law enforcement officers out to interview her about Kathie's disappearance.  She calls Bob and they talk about it.  The day before the officers arrive she is found dead in her home, killed execution style.  Her dogs wander through her small home leaving bloody paw prints on the floor.

The personal home movies, the interviews, the re-enactments by actors, the B-roll, all greatly watchable and fascinating.  Bob Durst confesses to Jarecki that he did, indeed, lie to the police after his wife disappeared.  He lied about making a pay-phone call to their NYC apartment.  He lied about having a drink with his next door neighbors the night she left the house to return to Manhattan.  He admits it.

By the time the last reel is almost completed you don't want it to end.  Why doesn't he just go ahead and spill the truth about everything?  You know that ain't gonna happen, right?  By this time you are mentally exhausted from all the material you have just watched.  What is it that is so fascinating about Robert Durst that keeps him in the tabloids and on TV for over 30 years. Obviously, there is something mesmerizing about him you can't put your finger on.  I don't think I will ever know why I, personally, find him so fascinating.  How does a man get away with not one, not two, but three murders?

The last five minutes of the documentary stun!  Jarecki confronts Durst with a Xerox copy of two envelopes.  Caught.  Like a deer in the headlights Bob Durst realizes they have the goods on him.  It implicates him in Susan Berman's murder.  But there is more. Perhaps you read about it or saw it on the program.  I won't go into it because it is a real 'spoiler' for someone who hasn't watched it yet.  What did he just say?!  You put the tape on pause and rewind a bit to play it again to make sure what you think he just said he actually said.  Out loud.  And yes, there it is.  Whoa!  Jarecki must have come unglued when he and his team heard it for the first time in editing.

What has happened since this docu-drama aired?  Bob Durst was arrested for urinating at a pharmacy on the candy display.  He was arrested in New Orleans the night before he was reportedly going to Cuba to keep from being extradited to California to stand trial for Susan Berman's murder. He was denied bail and remains, months later, in a New Orleans jail or hospital facility.  California authorities are fighting to bring him to trial there. Louisiana authorities want to try him on gun possession and drug possession.  Fire arms and marijuana were found in his hotel room along with thousands of dollars.  Who will win this one?  My feelings?  Bob Durst will be dead before this is ironed out.  He looks terminally ill throughout the film. I have suspicions as to what is ailing him but I won't put it in print.

I think in death, as in life, Bob Durst will have the last laugh on us all.  He will have gotten away with three murders (perhaps more) and never paid the price.  If you believe in the afterlife, then you believe he will be judged by a higher power.  The one good thing Bob did in his lifetime?  He didn't father children who might have grown up as emotionally disturbed as he is.  He knew this was a possibility and told his wife he did not want children. Ever.  He did the world a favor.

The documentary is one of the best ever shown on cable or regular television.  I cannot imagine another one that can touch this one for perfection in every area of movie-making.  Jarecki is a genius.",1435017600,48,8442,4.412987012987013

This is a tragic human being who has told so many lies he must rehearse his every thought and sentence.  You don't hate him, you feel sorry for his crippled little self, and all the damage that he's done.

I keep thinking of that poor woman of gangster descent living in self-imposed poverty writing unproduced gangster movie scripts before getting offed gangster-style by her closest friend (Durst), an unthinkable and barely credible fiction plot, and one very small gleam out of this phantasmagorical and glittering catalog of mayhem.

7005710,5,B00TEC7K62,"I saw the movie that this director first made about Durst that dealt with the disappearance of his wife Kathleen, ""All Good Things."" After the movie was released, Durst called the director and agreed to do an interview with him on camera. That interview is intercut throughout this fascinating documentary about the allegations that Dust has murdered three people: a neighbor in Galveston, Texas, a man; his first wife; his best friend, a woman. The first victim was found all cut up in the water. His first wife has never been found. The best friend was shot in the head. The theories go like this. With his marriage in trouble, he killed his wife so as to avoid having to pay her a big divorce settlement. His best friend helped him cover up that murder. When the best friend had money problems, she started blackmailing him that he had murdered his wife and she'd tell the police he killed her. The guy in Galveston also blackmailed him by threatening to tell New York tabloid reporters where he was hiding out, in Galveston. These are theories only and evidence is needed to win court cases, not just theories.

Durst looks like a very good candidate for being a murderer. He has loads of personal tics which are off putting. He no longer makes an attractive personal appearance (at the time of his first marriage he apparently did). He is frankly unlikable as one listens to him talk in the interview. However, he is very trainable by his lawyers as he did a brilliant job on the witness stand during one trial already. Very few defendants can be trained to take the witness stand in a criminal trial and do exceedingly well. He managed to do so.

There is a big problem with a lack of admissible evidence to use against him on the missing wife case. There is more evidence on the best friend but it doesn't seem very strong. The prosecution can tell its stories but when it comes to presenting witnesses and exhibits it is still somewhat iffy on what is usable. Additionally, Durst is very wealthy so has always been able to hire top defense lawyers.

I read up on the state of his health and it is terrible. He has hydrocephalus with a stent installed into his skull plus spinal surgery. This is a serious brain condition which has obviously affected his vision (his eyes look strange and he blinks constantly). Plus this condition causes mental disability. He's had it for a few years so anything he's said while having this condition was being said by a physiologically mentally disabled person. I would hate trying to get those statements admitted! He's also had a cancerous mass removed from his esophagus. That type of cancer has a very poor survival rate. Usually 6-18 months is about it for survival. Humphrey Bogart and Christopher Hitchens both died of it within that time frame.

I found this riveting material. I liked it as well as ""The Staircase"", about the murder trial of North Carolina author Michael Peterson. I had a lot of evidentiary problems with that case too and was not surprised when an appeals court had the same problems.

I am a lawyer but you don't need to be one to appreciate this material. I think anyone would find it compelling.",1429660800,17,3169,4.631672597864768

Andrew Jarecki began making movies about Robert Durst back in 2010, with the Ryan Gosling led All Good Things. Gosling's character was named something else, but was admittedly inspired by Robert Durst, a millionaire New York City real estate heir who has a...checkered past. If you've never seen All Good Things, you're definitely not in the minority - even with Gosling at the lead, the movie only earned about half a million dollars at the box office.

If you're a stranger to the mystery that is Robert Durst, I won't spoil much here. The gist of the mini-series is that Durst expressed admiration for the movie All Good Things and asked to be interviewed by Jarecki on camera to explain his side of the story for the first time. The resulting interviews, which take place over the course of a few years, take various twists and turns and shed new light on the mystery that has surrounded Mr. Durst.

I think that the best documentaries are those in which the filmmakers set out to accomplish one thing, but end up on a completely different path from when they started based on information they get while filming. Great examples of this are Dear Zachary and My Kid Could Paint That. When the fourth episode was over, I had no idea where the last two episodes would go - everything up until that point was public knowledge. However, there's a catalytic event in the fifth episode that changes the entire dynamic of the series. My thirst for the sixth and final episode once the fifth ended was unlike anything I've felt since waiting for the series finale of Breaking Bad.

Jarecki stumbled onto something important while making The Jinx, and handled it amazingly. I loved this series. The last five minutes alone are so powerful that I sat there, mouth agape for several minutes trying process what I had just seen and heard. You simply have to watch The Jinx. Before you do, don't look up anything up about Robert Durst. This is a dish best served cold.

The documentary genre definitely proves its worth, and I have no objection to the reenactments inserted here and there that enable to follow different theoretical leads. The recorded admission of guilt in the killings by Durst himself, however, is more debatable. Did he actually say this at the time noted in the film? Was it faked? I mention this because the documentary will definitely help his lawyers out in his upcoming trial in Los Angeles. If there is one. Durst may well get off scott-free.

7005744,5,B00TEC7K62,"The story of Robert Durst is bizarre and has been shrouded in mystery for decades. The Jinx dives into the history of this multi-millionaire murderer, and sheds light on Durst's tragic childhood and troubled adulthood. With dozens of interviews with people from Durst's past and present, The Jinx offers an in-depth look at the disappearance of Durst's first wife, the murder of his best friend, and the gruesome dismemberment of his neighbor.

The long list of interviewees includes Robert Durst himself, who offers a first-person account that at times feels both genuine and rehearsed. He's certainly spent a lot of time being coached by lawyers in the past, but there are points during the interviews where Durst says things that would make his entire legal team sweat.

He's either the luckiest or unluckiest man on earth. The Jinx tells the Robert Durst story in a way that feels less like a documentary and more like an episode of The Wire meets The Office. It's surprisingly entertaining, and the thrill of the mystery keeps you on the edge of your seat.",1428451200,8,1061,4.888888888888889

The director  Andrew Jarecki  avoids the should and ignores the must.  He steals the controversial  style of Errol Morriss ""The Thin Blue Line,"" and goes further off the map by using Morris like reenactments with no pretense of being objective. Jarecki inserts himself into the film and takes over the story, he builds his case to convict Dunst in a trial by film. He passes on disclosing background elements that would reveal that Dunst is insane. No need for truth to tell the story, this film might be a lot of things but it is not a documentary film.  Ironically this film aired for the first time in February 2015  that great documentary film-maker Albert Maysles, died 5 March 2015 at the age of 88.

Chapter by chapter (there are 6 - each approximately 45 minutes long) the most extraordinary and frankly unbelievable story evolves. It is almost Shakespearean in scale and is absolutely so in dramatic content. Just when you think you have sized up what you believe and what you don't, the next chapter turns you on your ear and delivers more extraordinary, gruesome and head shaking revelations - right up until the final seconds.

It was mesmerizing to see and hear Durst, the ultimate con man being interviewed.  He appeared relaxed, confident, rational, and in control.  As the film progressed, it soon became evident he was a very disturbed man capable of many things.  I must fess up to being stunned by some of  his blunders, especially the spectacular denouement.

I would like to have seen more on his early life which had to have been a large part of the reason he became the person that emerged later in adulthood, but the film, as it stands, is definitely worthy of 5+ stars.",1534118400,,788,4.633093525179856

I remember the hype when this film came out a few years back and was interested to watch it to see what all the buzz is about. Durst reaches out to Andrew Jarecki by phone after the film All Good Things comes out with stars Kristin Dunst. What I gleamed from this film is that Durst is somewhat of a tragic figure. He grew up in an unbelievably dysfunctional home where his mom tragically commits suicide and his father seems emotionally unavailable. While growing up in a family of great wealth and prosperity, the Dursts own much of New York's real estate in the billions of dollars some of which is in Times Square district, Robert Durst seems to be considered the outcast of the family and is ostracized as such. He spirals out of control and inevitably murders his wife, his close friend while pretending to be undercover in Texas and another close friend in California. He openly admits all this on film, while never seeming to take actual responsibility for these crimes. While it seems to be glossed over, it is apparent that he is very dependent on marijuana as a means to self medicate for his issues. Would this man be called a psychopath because he never seems to take responsibility for the murders? Perhaps, but what is more glaringly obvious as the film wraps up is that he is ultimately, a very lonely man in search of friends. Misunderstood and Jarecki, the producer seems to become this for him. Well told story for fans of True Crime.",1533859200,,1553,4.610108303249097
