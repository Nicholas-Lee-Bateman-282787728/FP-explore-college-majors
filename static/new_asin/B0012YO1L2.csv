8248227,4,B0012YO1L2,"The Films are a great representation of Hope's work, but the packaging is poor.  The DVD pages (It's a five disc set) were flimsy and 2 were already broken.  The set is out of print and BCI is out of business, so the set is recommended, but you might want to have an alternate case ready so the discs don't get lost or scratched.",1486944000,,329,4.125
8248228,5,B0012YO1L2,"An interesting collection of titles, many difficult to find and at a very good price - $7 for a used copy. Quality of prints varies considerably, some looking as though they come from video copies but, as these are for rarer titles like 'The Great Lover' or 'Lemon Drop Kid', this is easy to forgive. Widescreen titles tend to be pan & scan and 'Paris Holiday' has unhealthy-looking colour. Restored master copies look good. The set will keep me happy for hours.",1442880000,,462,4.646341463414634

8248231,5,B0012YO1L2,"There are four re-mastered films in this inexpensive collection:  The aforementioned Brunette, Road to Rio, Road to Bali, and Son of Paleface.
Some of Hope's funniest.  The other movies are good copies.  My personal favorite (My Favorite Brunette) outshines even my HD copy (yes a week after the death of HD-DVD was announced I got all excited when My Favorite Brunette turned up on my doorstep from Amazon a long ago pre-order arriving just after the funeral!).  The HD transfer was a big disappointment especially in those early prison scenes.  In this collection the restoration is the best that can be achieved with the original elements and long, long overdue.  Seeing him mix it up with Peter Lorre is worth the price of admission alone.  Normally with this kind of low-priced collection I am quite leary.  This one transcends the genre in a couple of ways.  The restored films are on two single-sided disks (thank heavens), two to a disc.  The rest of the collection and there are plenty of gems there too are on the usual double-sided discs, but the case is well designed for individual discs and not too fragile if you're carefull.  So I would recommend this collection to any serious Bob Hope fan on the strength of My Favorite Brunette alone but I don't have to because it's not bad on all counts and well worth the price.",1238112000,11,1333,4.702586206896552
8248232,2,B0012YO1L2,"This box set is great except for one thing - the lousy packaging. The DVDs are stacked one on top of another. Granted there is a plastic divider separating the DVDs. There are three DVDs on the left side and two on the other.
I am a serious DVD collector with nearly 2,000 in my collection and this kind of packaging is poor. I wished the company had packaged them better and charged a bit more them. That would have been fine. I take real good care of my DVDs.",1232841600,3,461,4.133333333333334
8248233,5,B0012YO1L2,I bought this collection just for My Favoritye Brunette. One of Bob Hope's best movies and finally a version that is good enough to watch. For $8.99 you can't go wrong. Now I can only hope BCI remasters The Cat and the Canary (1939).,1213660800,5,233,4.318181818181818
8248234,4,B0012YO1L2,"This has 10 Bob Hope movies and 4 are newly restored:
Road to Rio
Road To Bali
Son Of Paleface (with Roy Rogers and Trigger)
My Favorite Brunette

My girlfriend didn't realize that Bob was this funny with his one-liners in Road to Bali. Even if you don't like all the movies in this collection I would still suggest buying this as it is less expensive than a movie matinee and considering the era I would say at least there are 3 of the movies that really stand out. Good quality DVD's and nice packaging.",1213228800,4,505,4.315789473684211
