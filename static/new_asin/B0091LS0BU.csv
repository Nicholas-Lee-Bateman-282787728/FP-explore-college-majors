5242281,5,B0091LS0BU,"I saw the abbreviated version of LIVE KISSES on PBS. I hadn't expected to enjoy it as I didn't care much for KISSES ON THE BOTTOM, thinking Paul's voice was weak and any real energy lacking.

Much to my surprise and delight, LIVE KISSES is a highly enjoyable experience. Paul's voice sounds a lot stronger in these sessions, and he's clearly enjoying himself, as are the band. Their performance is also much more energetic and loose. I thought the bass player, John Clayton, excelled in particular.

The interviews between songs were interesting and delved into the history of Capitol Studios, as well as Paul's love for the material. It really came through in his performance. I'm certain the unedited version on DVD will be even better. The bonus material--the videos of ""My Valentine"" and the interview about the making of the album--are icing on the cake.

Highly recommended for all McCartney fans, as well as lovers of standards.",1347235200,58,935,4.905063291139241

together with the many excellent guests, has given Paul perfect backing. McCartney is as they say the consummate musician. In his own words
he found a unique way of singing these appealing songs, that works so well...... the tempo is held back and just oozes cool jazz. The expressions
on the faces of the accompanying guitarists is priceless. For me this is a very special DVD.....",1420761600,,517,4.630434782608695

5242310,5,B0091LS0BU,"50 years after The Beatles landed, Sir Paul created a wonderful, double Grammy winning video that will delight fans and lovers.

Sir Paul McCartneys double Grammy winning Live Kisses Blu-Ray is a perfect Valentine for a Beatles fan or a special someone who likes to be romantic.

The video won two Grammys last month for Best Surround Sound Album and Best Music Film. Ive watched this video several times over the past year and get all choked up every time. My wife says Im a mushy guy but she loves me for that.

While everyone from Rod Stewart on is mining the 50s ballads some of us remember, Sir Paul picked his repertoire from the music of his parents from the 1930s and 1940s.  Unlike the raspy voiced and leering Stewart,  Sir Paul is the perfect gentleman, smooth and smoother.

Sir Paul was crooning ballads on the first album of The Beatles with A Taste of Honey and on the 2nd album with Till There Was You. He has an amazing ability to span ballads to rock.  Sir Paul also wrote Yesterday one of the most popular songs of all time. Some critics have dissed My Valentine a new song he wrote last year but I find it has grown on me and is perfectly lovely.

The CD is wonderful to hear but watching Sir Paul sing and interact with musicians like Diana Krall, Eric Clapton, and Joe Walsh is pure magic. I will admit to getting goose bumps several times watching Live Kisses. It is one of the sweetest videos I own.

The video was shot in stunning black and white with 24-bit audio recording and the sound is superb. Everything is crystal clear.

The only quibble is the narration between songs is less interesting on second and third viewing. The Apple iTunes live stream did not have the extra dialogue which I can do without.",1394841600,,1736,4.44794952681388
5242311,5,B0091LS0BU,I have loved the Beatles from the beginning of their careers. I was 10 years old when I first heard them. I have been in love with all of their music since. This is a group of different music. I adore Sir Paul.,1393459200,,210,3.9069767441860463
5242312,4,B0091LS0BU,"Of course he's not Frankyboy or some other great crooner (there a only very view, anyway). But you learn a lot about the other side of Mr. PMC. He's a real gentleman, no allures, with great respect for the musicians and the engineers. And he sings very good. He has obviously great joy recording in the studio with perfect musicians. Well done! The monochrome film is probably not to everybodys liking - but in MHO it focuses more on the plot and the action than color film.",1392940800,,474,4.459770114942529
5242313,5,B0091LS0BU,I always loved the old classics sung by Sinatra and other artists. I grew up in the 80's as a HUGE Beatles fan but always loved that classic style of music of the 1940's. Paul McCartney does a great job on these songs. Paul only sings the vocals and leaves the music to several of the best musicians around. Linda Krall is just fantastic on these recordings. The dvd shows a live version of these recordings done so well....sounds great.....just a treat if you'ew a fan of music of the 1940'sand  50's...and can appreciate some excellent musicias playing some jazz and old classics.

5242341,5,B0091LS0BU,"Take a look at this ageless wonder. I don't know how he does it. McCartney continues to stay creative whether in his rock music, classical scores, or his newest venture, the world of standards. Many other classic icons have attempted recording of the ""Great American Songbook"" such as Jeff Lynn and Rod Stewart, but somehow you get the feeling they did it because they have lost their creativity. It's a fact of life. You can't expect albums like ""Eldorado"" and ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" to continue to be released after 40 years in the business any more than you could expect Joe Montana to be still throwing passes of the 49ers. But there is an exception to any rule and that's what McCartney provides here. First was the album, which incidently just won him a Grammy, and the beautiful, fresh interpretations he brought to these songs. The DVD gives an in-depth documentation of the passion and creative genius of Sir Paul. Sit with him in the classic Capitol Records studio and watch pure magic. You have a sence of being right in the studio as these tried and true songs are alive again with Paul's distinct treatment. Take a look at the microphone and imagine back to when it captured the beauty of Nat King Cole's voice. Paul, you are truly one of a kind and this latest venture gives us yet another side of your endless talents. We still love you well after you turned 64.",1361145600,,1384,4.584677419354839
5242342,5,B0091LS0BU,"Paul McCartney sings no Beatles songs on this DVD (although there is a nice number he wrote called ""Valentine"".) Trust me, the absence of songs by the Fab Four is no problem. Here, Paul sings the ""standards"", the pop songs of the 1940s and 50s, mostly, and it's a wonderful experience. Backing him up are Diana Krall and her group, plus Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder and a number of other talented musicians, including a small orchestra. An experienced technical crew and dedicated producers also lend their talents. The program is filmed in black and white and was made in the old Capitol Records buildings in Hollywood. There is a fine intimacy here, with many tight closeups of Paul alternating with close views of the musicans. There are many moments where you really do feel you're a part of the whole process and it's a truly memorable performance. Among the songs are ""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,"" ""Accentuate the Positive,"" ""The Glory of Love,"" and an especially lovely song called ""Home,"" and a load of others. In between numbers are commentary by Paul and different musicians and technicians who worked on the program. Even if you're not familiar with the songs on the DVD, you're still likely to enjoy it. I love it.",1360540800,,1249,4.76036866359447

5242345,5,B0091LS0BU,"Saw the PBS presentation and knew the video would make a great Christmas gift for my nephew, who is an awesome musician/guitarist, himself.  I almost decided to keep it for myself, since the classic songs Paul chose, from the American Songbook, were songs he recalled and loved from his childhood.  Many of you will remember them, too, as they are the tunes that stay in your head and you find that you remember ALL the lyrics, even after all these years.  Paul also includes his new song, ""My Valentine"", accompanied by the great Joe Walsh (James Gang and Eagles) on guitar.  Paul's wonderful running commentary, along with interviews with the likes of Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Diana Krall and the show's producer, Tony LiPuma and others, add much to the presentation.  I guarantee that you'll be singing along, as you take this delightful walk down memory lane.  I know, I did.",1358208000,,883,4.814569536423841
5242346,4,B0091LS0BU,"When one is the most successful musician from the most successful pop group of all time, one has carte blanche to pursue any projects you want. In this instance, the artist is Sir Paul McCartney, and the project is a live concert from the acclaimed Capitol Studios building in Los Angeles to promote his new recording of oldies, ""Kisses on the Bottom.""

Titled ""Live Kisses,"" McCartney performs tracks from the above mentioned recording, featuring classics from his childhood, as well as two new original pieces written in the style of these golden standards.  With a band led by jazz pianist Diana Krall, and featuring first-string musicians John Pizzarelli on guitar, bassist John Clayton, drummer Karriem Riggins, and his touring drummer, Abe Laboriel Jr., on backing vocals, McCartney appears at ease in front of this exclusive audience, where he performs his set in the famous location where Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole made some of their most well-known records.  Director Jonas Akerlund filmed the intimate evening almost entirely in black and white, and adds some tasteful special effects to enhance the mood of the film.

With his superstar status firmly established, the 70-year-old McCartney has very little left to prove at this junction in his life, deciding to explore the melodies of his youth on this latest set. The song choices that he made, along with Krall and producer Tommy LiPuma, range from Fats Waller's ""I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter"" (where the lyric ""Kisses on the Bottom"" comes from) and ""My Very Good Friend the Milkman,"" to the lesser known ""More I Cannot Wish You"" from Frank Loesser's stage version of ""Guys and Dolls,"" and the Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer standard, ""Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive.""  McCartney's gracefully-aged voice lends itself well to the tunes, and though the set list is a bit ballad-heavy, his band blends wonderfully within the arrangements.

Bonus Features include behind-the-scenes footage for the making of ""My Valentine,"" one of the McCartney originals on the album.  Featuring Johnny Depp and Natalie Portman (who also appeared in McCartney's ""Dance Tonight"" video), fans will enjoy the informal interaction between the actors and the songwriter.",1358121600,2,2249,5.196132596685083

5242348,5,B0091LS0BU,"I appreciate this Blu-ray Dvd more than I appreciated just listening to the cd.  It is hard to see how much of his singing voice he has lost; of course, he is 70 yrs old now 3 yrs older than me.  I don't know if he should really be singing anymore; but it must be hard to give it up it has been his whole life. As someone who is just a few years younger; this watching yourself age is certainly not easy because no matter how old your body gets you will always feel younger inside.
I have been a Paul McCartney fan since the first time I heard him as part of the Beatles when they came to the U.S. in 1964.
I was a loyal fan of Wings. When Linda McCartney died; I still followed his music on his own. I even have Linda McCartney's solo album which was released after her death which was a labor of love for Paul.
Thank you Amazon for selling this special Blu-ray Dvd of Paul McCartney's latest music.
I forgot to mention how much I love that sweet Valentine song that Paul McCartney wrote for his new wife; it is very sweet and touching.  Any woman would be proud to have such a sweet song written about her; and also sung to her with so much love.
Way to go Paul :-) :-)",1356825600,,1171,4.017167381974249

5242359,4,B0091LS0BU,"Let's get a couple of things out of the way first:  If you're the kind of music fan who would prefer Paul McCartney to just keep belting out Get Back and Band on the Run for the rest of his life, then keep walking - there's nothing for you here.  Likewise, if you don't think it ever got better than Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra, then you're going to find little to love in this show.  If your tastes allow for some exploration, then read on.

Doing and album and/or show of old standards has become almost as much a rock clich as stint in rehab.  Over the years, the quality of such albums has ranged from the sublime (Harry Nilsson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Little-Touch-of-Schmilsson-in-the-Night/dp/B000EQ47WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night</a>) to the ridiculous (Robbie Williams'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swing-When-You-re-Winning/dp/B00005RFVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swing When You're Winning</a>).  The fact is that any idiot can buy a hat, hire a decent arranger and sing into a microphone once used by Sinatra.  So why should we follow Macca down this well-worn path?

Well, there are a few good reasons.  Firstly, McCartney is old enough to remember some of these songs when they were current, and to have sung them around the family Johanna so his fondness for these tunes has not been confected from a lot of received wisdom.  He has also revealed an ongoing fondness for the style since the early days of the Beatles, from covers of 'Til There Was You and A Taste of Honey, through When I'm Sixty Four and Honey Pie to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warm-and-Beautiful/dp/B003PK265E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warm and Beautiful</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-s-Request/dp/B00A46IRKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby's Request</a>&nbsp;with Wings, he's already done plenty of dabbling in the genre.  Thirdly, as one of the people who made Abbey Road ""da place,"" he has no need for the reflected glory of working at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.

He's also well aware of how many artists have done this before and has taken pains to set this collection apart from them by choosing lesser known songs and going for quiet, subtle versions of the songs where many before him - including some of the originals - preferred to go for bombast.  It's this approach that makes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kisses-On-The-Bottom/dp/B0076OW9DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kisses On The Bottom</a>&nbsp;and this companion DVD more than just the obligatory standards album.

The film intersperses the songs with interviews discussing the making of the album and the show.  On a regular concert film this would be a pain but on this one it works fine.  This is mainly because Live Kisses isn't so much a concert as a live run through of some songs.  As always with a McCartney show, he shares a great camaraderie with the band, led by Diana Krall and featuring Joe Walsh sitting in on Eric Clapton's parts.  This is another departure from similar albums, where there could be a bit of a master/servant relationship between singer and players.

What really makes this a unique McCartney performance is that for once, it's entirely about Paul the singer.  Although everyone knows he has one of the greatest voices of the last half-century, that fact has always been parallel to his talents as songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer.  And with every song, you can tell he's chosen it because part of it speaks to him.  This is not a case of the singer putting on an act.  He does present his own interpretations of the songs but never do they deviate from the song's original meaning.  It's been said that Paul's voice is not what it used to be.  Two points on that topic: Firstly, duh!  The man is 70 years old.  You should sound as good at that age.  Secondly, while his voice is considerably weaker than it was in 1967, it does lend itself very well to his intention of bringing out the vulnerability in the songs.  This is not an album he could have made when he was 30.

The arrangements occasionally veer a little too close to hotel lobby music but for the most part, they are tasteful and understated, neither being too reverential to the originals, nor interpreting them within an inch of their lives.  The one place it doesn't quite work is on Bye Bye Blackbird which almost becomes a dirge.  They do, however, almost manage to redeem The Glory of Love for me after Beaches pretty well ruined it.

Most of the film is presented in black and white with a slightly harsh contrast that is less 1940s film and more like early 1960s television.  It suits the music very well though.  One rather annoying aspect is lots of jump cuts early in the piece.  In a show like this, a shot should last for at least one bar of music.

There's no denying this DVD has a pretty limited market.  You couldn't even call it a fans-only release because there will be thousands of fans who will hate him for not making a proper rock album, whatever that means.  There will be others who laud it purely for being McCartney with no other reason.  This show can only be judged for what it is and McCartney, Diana Krall and producer Tommy LiPuma have managed to create a set that strikes the right balance of familiarity and originality, authenticity and playfulness.  If you don't like it, then you don't like it, but it's better than you think.",1355097600,10,5637,5.260626398210291
5242360,4,B0091LS0BU,"As a fan of the Great American Songbook, I was curious to hear Paul McCartney's ""Kisses on The Bottom"" CD when it was released last year. I though he did a credible job in the covers though I thought his voice was a bit off. Still, I felt, he gave new exposure to songs I still play on my 78rpm records. I missed the live stream and the PBS special of this ""studio concert"" version of the songs from the album so the DVD package was my first viewing.

To make things clear, though the 75-minute centerpiece of this DVD was taped in the studio, with Paul wearing headphones, this was not the actual recording session for the KOTB CD. This was a re-creation with most of the original musicians. While Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder were on the CD, they are not performing here, though there are interview clips.

The package gives a running time of 127 minutes but be aware that this includes the FIVE versions of the ""My Valentine"" music video as well as two promo videos for KOTB. There is a 15 minute interview with McCartney and Producer Tommy LiPuma by music journalist Robert Hilburn , from which many sections  were included in the 75-minute core program.

I found that WATCHING McCartney sing the songs often covered the age in his voice. Honestly, at 70 his voice is showing its age.

I'll defer to my fellow reviewer, Tante Maren, for the details of the program - though he/she had not seen the DVD at the time of his/her review since it wasn't released until two months later. The packaging should also be mentioned. The DVD is inserted in the back of a 5x7 HARDBOUND book which includes a six-page Introduction by Elvis Costello (whose wife, Diana Krall, is the pianist and music director for the performance) and a 26 page ""conversation via Skype"" between Costello and McCartney which discusses the albums concert and pop music in general. (Costello has always been a great interviewer of other performers.). There are six pages of musician credits and a number of ""session photos"" to fill out the book.

Overall I liked the set a lot and McCartney fans will certainly want this for their collection. While the 75 minutes of studio performances were engaging, the multiple versions of the McCartney-penned ""My Valentine"" are a bit of overkill for the casual buyer. Hence the four, rather than, five stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5242365,5,B0091LS0BU,"This release finds Paul McCartney in strong voice, though his appoach is much subtler than most of his earlier work.  In his take on these light jazz classics, the singer ranges between the agressive approach Frank Sinatra would often take and the laid back style of Bing Crosby.  The result is a deligtful middle ground that treats the songs with thoughtful phrasing without making them either boring and effete or too boisterous.  When more energy is needed, Paul steps it up such as on I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter and Ac-Centuate the Positive.  When a more nuanced approach is needed he tones it down perfectly such as on Irving Berlin's classic Always or the unique take he delivers with Bye Bye Blackbird.  There are many hits and very few misses.  Inch Worm is charmingly arranged though many may think of it more as a children's song.  Paul's take on the bluesy Get Yourself Another Fool is picture perfect.  And his original songs don't suffer a bit when compared to the old classics that comprise the balance of this brilliant collection.

It is packaged in a nice hardcover book with photos and liner notes by Elvis Costello (the husband of the gorgeous pianist).

5242370,5,B0091LS0BU,"On February 9, 2012, 69 year old Sir Paul McCartney filmed and recorded LIVE KISSES at Capitol Records Studios in Hollywood- a collaboration of some of the most beautiful old American classic love and hope songs that Sir Paul recalls from his childhood family gatherings. I don't know if this is a co-incidence or not, but these heavenly songs were recorded and filmed exactly 48 years since The Beatles first U.S. appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. It's a wonderful co-incidence as these songs are just as wonderful to listen to as those early Beatles hits.

Of all the Beatles, for me, Paul was totally and completely about love, and this latest beautiful achievement of Paul's is a testament to that. I always felt that John was more political, George spiritual, Ringo very rhythmic and Paul was pure love.  I know Paul's voice at 70 is not as powerful as when he had to out scream thousands of fans back in the sixties, but his voice is softly powerful, as it should be for these beautiful classic songs. His voice is so beautifully strong, you wish he would have recorded about a hundred more of these old favorites for this dvd.  I am a child of the fifties, but my mother had a piano and sang many of these 1920's and 1930's songs to me, that she learned as a child, so I know many of these lyrics and can't help but sing along.

Live Kisses is produced by grammy winning producer Tommy LiPuma, conducted by Alan Broadbent, with the talents of Al Schmitt in the control room, Diana Krall at the piano, John Clayton, Karriem Riggins, John Pizzarelli on guitar, Anthony Wilson and Mike Mainieri. Paul strictly sings on this dvd and the harmony he creates with his drummer Abe Laboriel Jr. on three of the songs including I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter, is simply pure magic. The talented Joe Walsh (James Gang, Eagles) outdoes himself with his beautiful guitar work on McCartney's MY VALENTINE and also on GET YOURSELF ANOTHER FOOL. Included, besides these beautiful heavenly songs, are interviews with Paul, Diana Krall, Tony LiPuma, Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder. There are more extras as well.

The 13 Classic American Songs Included Are:
01.) I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter (1935 Ahlert/Young)- Fats Waller hit
02.) Home (When Shadows Fall) (1932 Van Steeden/Clarkson/Clarkson)-  Rudy Vallee hit
03.) It's Only A Paper Moon (1933 Arlen/Harburg/Rose)- Count Basie hit
04.) The Glory Of Love (1936 Hill)- Andrew Sisters hit
05.) More I Cannot Wish You (1950 Loesser)- Guys & Dolls hit
06.) We Three (My Echo, My Shadow & Me) (1939 Cogane,Mysels, Robertson)- The Ink Spots hit
07.) Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive (1944 Mercer/Arlen)- Andrew Sisters hit
08.) My Valentine (Paul McCartney)
09.) Always (1925 Berlin)- The Ink Spots, Frank Sinatra hit
10.) My Very Good Friend The Milkman (1935 Spina /Burke)- Fats Waller hit
11.) Bye Bye Blackbird (1926 Henderson/Dixon)- Gene Austin, Eddie Cantor hit
12.) Get Yourself Another Fool (1949 Haywood/Tucker)- Charles Brown, Sam Cooke hit
13.) My One And Only Love (1952 Wood/Mellin)- Frank Sinatra hit

With Paul using only his voice, and not his other instruments of his bass, guitar and piano, he really focuses on the beauty of the sentimental lyrics, and what you get is pure magic beautifully sung with the gorgeous music accompanying him. I first heard Paul singing these classics in the kitchen while cooking and asked my husband what he was watching on tv- when he said Paul McCartney- I almost fell over, as I would never recognize Paul doing these American classics. He is simply amazing!

As much as I love all these old 20's, 30's depression, 40's war years and 50's songs, I adore Irving Berlin's ALWAYS. You can feel the love in the words, as Irving Berlin wrote this song for the woman he wanted to marry, but whose father forbid it. Because Irving was a struggling poor Jewish writer and was in love with a wealthy Christian woman Ellin Mackay, Ellin's father forbid she see him, so he sent her overseas to Europe. Irving didn't let an ocean stop him from telling his beloved Ellin that he loved her, so he wrote ALWAYS and it played on the radios all over the world. When Ellin heard it, she couldn't believe how much Irving loved her and married him against her father's wishes.  The words are so fitting- I'll Be Loving You Always- as I have always felt that Paul McCartney's music has always said the same thing to not only his girlfriends or wives, but to his fans. From the first time I heard The Beatles sing, Til There Was You, Paul was the Irving Berlin of my 60's generation. He just knows how to make you feel love.

If you are a McCartney fan or simply love the old American Classic Songs from the 20's, 30's, 40's and 50's, you will love LIVE KISSES, and I guarantee you will not be able to keep from singing along and wish there was much more of this beautiful music from Sir Paul! And to Sir Paul who just keeps on giving us fans such beautiful unexpected gifts- I say to you from your fans- We'll Be Loving You Always And Thank You Sir Paul For Yet Another Gift Of Love!",1347753600,43,5101,4.6452328159645235

I thought Paul's difficulty in whistling his part in ""My Very Good Friend The Milkman"" was endearing and was sorry to see it cut from the PBS show. I was hoping that the complete, uncut performance would be part of the bonus material but, alas, it appears it is not. That is a shame. I will purchase this DVD because the collection of musicians on the album are amazing. To see them perform these, sometimes unknown classics with such professional perfection is more than worth the price.

8534337,5,B0091LS0BU,"I ordered ""Kisses on the Bottom"" (the cd) after hearing a reprise of an interview with Paul McCartney, done by Terry Gross.  As I waited for the cd to arrive, I also learned about the PBS special, ""Live Kisses"" and decided that I wanted to enjoy both the music and the video together, as one experience.  Thanks to Amazon, both wishes were fulfilled quickly and last night I indulged.  I so appreciated the way the video begins, with McCartney fondly recalling his parents/relatives gathering for fun long-ago occasions, ""rolling back the rug"", sipping drinks, and singing.  The deceptively-simple recollection, told with a nod and a grin, made me think about how many seeds of later life (and, for that matter, lifelong interests and fascinations) are sown in early childhood and remain forever.  McCartney mentions more than once his long-standing desire to do this album, and his reasons for delaying.......Feeling perhaps that others had gotten to the idea first, and his desire to avoid ""copying"", etc.  Those hours spent in the classic Capitol Record studios must have felt like kismet.........the perfect nexus of tunes, fellow kindred musicians, the deep appreciation for the traditions of the surroundings and the musical compositions, etc.  The film maker does a fine job of capturing the collaborative mood of the sessions, and moments of both studious reverie and satisfied murmurs of ""ahhhhhh, great"".  The intimate quality of the film makes us feel like one of the fortunate few friends invited to the session, with the plus that we enjoy evocative close-ups of hands and instruments.  The eye flickers between the performers provide a glimpse of the collective kindred spirit; and one could speculate that perhaps all of them had waited ""a very long time"" for this right place, right time, right everything.  Another factor that assured I would love this album/dvd was the inclusion of Diana Krall and John Pizzarelli; two consummate musical masters and (for my money) national treasures.  Paul's voice is perfect for these tunes - and he is totally at home whether the lyric calls for tenderness, whimsy, nostalgia, or pathos.

McCartney -- and the heart he wears on his sleeve is pure gold.",1498521600,,2272,5.077956989247312
