Besides, be careful, there is absolutely no subtitles on this dvd as opposed to Amazon's description",1440028800,,211,5.057142857142857
8689702,5,B00PXDUITW,"hard to find film until now. very strange but very interesting movie from the late sixties. it has music in it that is kinda of
catching. and interesting cast that includes Oscar winner Jennifer Jones. Cult of the Damned is definitely a cult movie
though the original title of this is Angel Angel Down We Go.",1425081600,4,308,4.517857142857143
8689703,4,B00PXDUITW,"A downright bizarre and fascinating avant-garde style film that it is a must see for fans of the genre. Initially released as ""Angel, Angel, Down We Go"" in 1969, the film quickly vanished from theaters. It came out just a few weeks after the Manson murders which diminished the era of carefree, drug-infused, flower-child youth. It was never released on VHS or DVD and even inferior bootleg copies were hard to find. Thanks to Kino Lorber for finally releasing this fantastic Blu-ray edition.

The film centers around Tara Nicole, an overweight teen whose life has been emotionally scarred by her dysfunctional parents, a closeted business tycoon and his glamorous wife, who once starred in porn films. After Tara returns home from finishing school abroad, her mothers throws her a party. There she meets the charismatic Bogart Peter Stuyvesant, a rock singer who ends up seducing not only her but both her parents. There are several musical numbers although the film is not a musical (it is actually hard to categorize).

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this film is its cast. Singer/songwriter Holly Near is perfect as Tara Nicole as is Jordan Christopher as the Bon-Jovi-type rock singer Bogart. His band members, are memorably played by Lou Rawls, Roddy McDowell and Davey Davison. The most perplexing casting, however, comes with the refined, elegant Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Jones, in a role that can only be described as shocking. As Tara's mother, Astrid Steele, she mouths a number of off-color lines (""I made 30 stag films and never faked an orgasm"") and appears in a number of see-through gowns. She plays the role seriously, however, and she looks fantastic, costumed by Renie' and voluptously coiffed by legendary Sydney Guilleroff.

This Blu-Ray DVD release looks great with a clear picture that excellently makes the colorful sets and costumes pop. The bright and colorful interiors, mostly shot in Marion Davies' Hollywood home, are juxtaposed with muted, foggy dream-like sequences. Also notable are the outre' collages by designer Shirley Kaplan which are splashed throughout the film. Aside from a few shots that look fuzzy, the picture is sharp and crisp. An excellent commentary by film historian Nathaniel Thompson and Tim Greer provide valuable background information. The theatrical trailer and a stills gallery is also included. Oddly, no subtitles are included.",1424217600,9,2400,5.228571428571429
