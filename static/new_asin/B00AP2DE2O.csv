8555553,4,B00AP2DE2O,"I'm always glad to get more than one movie in a pack, and I love disaster movies. This is a chance to have a couple of movies for your disaster collection that you probably won't find anywhere else. The movies themselves are somewhat cheesy with only moderately bad acting, but that is probably because the scrips are a little weak. 3 to 4-star graphics, and worth a look see.",1455926400,,376,4.463768115942029

This is my experience.

Content:

3/5 stars

This pack comes in a double dvd case with one disc sitting inside a flip-over add-on, while the other disc sits on the back of the inside of the dvd case, like most dvd's not in a pack. The discs inside this set are the exact dvd's which are inside the non-pack dvd's. Basically if you already own one of these separately, that disc is in this set. Glad this was not on a double sided disc.

There are no special features on either disc. Then again, what else do you expect when you come buying lower budget movies?

Meteor: 3.5/5 stars

Meteor was pretty good being a miniseries. Special effects are good, but not as great as ones in hollywood movies, but that's kinda expected here. Acting was good, but could be better. Bumped it up to 3.5/5 stars because you might get a cool wallpaper close to the ending.

The Storm: 3.5/5 stars

The Storm was also good. Special effects are quite good. A few examples being in the dvd menu itself. Acting was good. We can all complain about the science in these movies, but don't try to think about it and enjoy yourself!

Don't expect ""it's gonna be every 2 minutes!"" in the way of special effects, and expect more violence than usual. Example: killing, murder, guns etc.

Overall: 4/5 stars

This miniseries pack is a great addition to any disaster movie fanatic's collection! (Me being one of them) If you are A person looking for a gift for one, but looking cheaper, this set is only $8.99 right here. Makes a great gift! Just remember that this pack is not for a child. These miniseries contain intense violence, obviously the destruction, some language but not that often, and almost no sex scenes as i remember. I hope this review helps you decide on buying this item or not. thanks for reading!",1434067200,,1915,4.502890173410405
