8435880,5,B004MBAARG,"Video quality was great & I love that it had subtitles built in that were timed correctly to when the characters were speaking. I hate it when the subs show up before or after the subject. I love my copy, even though Netflix has it.",1395878400,,232,4.177777777777778
8435881,3,B004MBAARG,"This was not an official DVD set as was made apparent when I put the DVD in and the Main Menu was spelled 'Main Muen"" and the translations included personal notes about things going on in the story with smiley faces and hearts.  Also, news alerts were running along the bottom of the picture and a TV Channel identifier kept popping up every 15 minutes or so.",1323216000,,359,4.358208955223881
8435882,1,B004MBAARG,"I wasn't happy with the product at all. The subtitles are not very good and the actual show still has what looks like news bulletins scrolling across the bottom of the screen at some parts (as if someone recorded it as it was aired originally). When I put in the third disc it wouldn't play at all. I ended up having to buy a different version from a different company. If you would like to own this series, I highly suggest paying twenty more dollars for a better quality.",1311897600,,473,4.325842696629214
8435883,4,B004MBAARG,"I was extremely excited when my very own copy of Mischievous Kiss, Naughty Kiss, Playful Kiss was delivered. I immediately started to view my copy only to find that the subtitles started out good but got progressivly worse as the episodes went on making viewing difficult and hard to understand. I still LOVE this drama anyway.",1305936000,3,327,4.857142857142857
