8136368,5,B000H5U5H6,"Awesome martial arts action and a must have in my humble opinion .
Watch out if buying this on vhs . If it says the tape is ep , lp , slp or elp just avoid it as any tape recorded at these speeds is going to be money wasted .
If its a tape and its not recorded in sp (standard play) then the tape will not last you very long before its unwatchable .
I was going to buy the dvd off amazon till I saw its not english dubbed so im just going to get this one from netflix .",1419724800,,469,3.563106796116505

8136370,3,B000H5U5H6,"""Death Cage"" is one of the countless Hong Kong films that place action content so high on the list of priorities that there's little use to watch any part of the movie besides the fight scenes...with the bonus that this one stars future&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;alumnus Robin Shou and karate mega champ Joe Lewis. Seriously, that's what you get: flat storyline, pitiful acting, some questionable production moments, and Shou battling his way through some very cool fights for 92 minutes (Lewis only has one at the end). Decide now whether or not this is worth it for you; if you require a balance between your action and dramatics, leave this film behind because it's a thoroughly one-sided affair.

The story: when star pupil Si Han Lan (Shou) of Wan Chai gym is defeated in combat by the cheating trainees of the gym run by the greedy Mr. Kent (Lewis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaguar-Lives/dp/B000O75GEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaguar Lives</a>), he and his godfather must vacate their premises and retreat to their auto shop to make a living. Kent's students continue to harass Si Han and his family; it will only be with the tutelage of his visiting Uncle Tang (Mark Long,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7-Grand-Masters/dp/B0001610QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">7 Grand Masters</a>) that he will learn both the skills and discipline to master his opponents and Mr. Kent's scheme of continuing to exploit his loss.

You should know that I've listed just about all of the well-known performers in the movie; the only other actor/fighter with any real credits to his name is Steve Tartalia (who fought in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-China/dp/B000050B7J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in China</a>&nbsp;and stunt-doubled James Marsters throughout&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>) as Kent's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. All of the other featured cast generally hadn't been and wouldn't be seen in any other movies. Thus, I guess I ought to be thankful that the acting doesn't come across as worse, transcendental of the Cantonese dubbing. The film's production values are solid despite the obvious limited budget (most of which went towards building the impressive cage for the final two fight scenes, I think), although the cinematography occasionally gets lazy when the camera seems to grow roots and focus on a single shot for minutes at a time.

The action scenes save the film like nothing else. Even though the first half-hour is fairly meager on the fisticuffs, the remaining two thirds of the movie boast ten very bloody hand-to-hand and hand-to-sword matches deserving of acclaim. Even though we'd never see most of the combatants again - like Simon 'Monkey Fighter' Lin, evil ladies Nina Burt and Jojo Roe, and Tiger 'Mullet Head' Kim (whose second match with Shou can best be described as a kung fu wrestling encounter) - they all lend themselves to some stellar encounters emphasizing complex technical hand-to-hand exchanges, awesome kicking, and minimal wirework. The last two matches, featuring Steve Tartalia and Joe Lewis, take place within the bamboo cage (no doubt, this one influenced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-the-Kickboxers/dp/6302128161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of the Kickboxers</a>) and are easily the highlight of the film: admittedly, I prefer Tartalia's moves over Lewis', but both do justice to both themselves and Robin Shou, who leaves no doubt why he became China's wushu champion. Okay, the first couple of fights are a bit on the slow side, and a few of the in-between matches lag at moments, but in the end, exceedingly few of them will disappoint Hong Kong action freaks.

There's a rather silly scene near the beginning of the film where Mark Long proves his kung fu's efficiency by showing that he can polish a car via its techniques; this doesn't really influence the film's quality, but it's really the only circumstance where the viewer can focus on something other than the dull dramatics and awesome fighting. I'll say it again: what you see is what you get, so there's little room to be surprised or disappointed beyond your expectations. Fans of Shou ought to definitely buy this one to get better acquainted with their hero's earlier work, but anybody who doesn't want to step down from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>&nbsp;should leave this one be.",1262649600,2,4951,6.2128279883381925
