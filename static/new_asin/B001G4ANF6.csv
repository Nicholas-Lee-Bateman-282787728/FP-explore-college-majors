8303763,5,B001G4ANF6,"This has become one of my favorite step workouts.  It is probably too difficult for a beginner, but it should not be overly dance-y or difficult for an intermediate.  The workout consists of 5 short sets of step work-outs and cardio blasts.  The menu lets you choose as many of these as you would like to put together.  Nekea cues well, and is obviously having a lot of fun.  I definitely recommend this one.",1337212800,,408,4.45945945945946
