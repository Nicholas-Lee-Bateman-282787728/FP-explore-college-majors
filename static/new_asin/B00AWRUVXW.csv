8558540,5,B00AWRUVXW,Great workout low impact one of Cathe best low workouts,1491350400,,55,4.6
8558541,3,B00AWRUVXW,"Part 1 - the aerobic part - is great for days I skip the gym for some low impact cardio that's super easy to follow but gets me slightly sweaty.
Part 2 - the step part - too fast and choreographed - I skip an will never use
Part 3 - the discs keep slipping off my feet and I could not do on medium plush carpet. Probably best for Berber users or do on an ice skating rink?",1487721600,2,372,3.721518987341772
8558542,5,B00AWRUVXW,"I wanted to re-charge my cardio routine which had become dull, so I enlisted the help of Cathe's Hiit workouts.  This one has rejuvenated my routine!  The All Out Low Impact Hiit is a great workout for those who haven't done Hiit before.  It has 2 sections that can be done all at once or separately.  The beginner can start with one routine and then build to do both at once. also a good workout when time is short. Din't let the words low-impact fool you into thinking this is easy.  It is very challening without pounding your joints, but keeps the heart rate up!  It is one of the few workouts I've purchased that isn't overly repetitive, which keeps it fresh.  I also love the Abs section on it -which i found challenging despite the fact I have strong abs.  Note: if you want a Hiit workout with more weights, then I recommend Cathe's Afterburn Hiit workout.  But overall, All Out Low Impact is a great cardio workout for those who are short on time or just want to have high intensity interval training included in their routine.  Another great Cathe workout!",1396310400,,1066,4.476683937823834
8558543,5,B00AWRUVXW,"First let me say I've never done a Cathe workout that I didn't like, although some I like more than others. For the past several years, I have done Cathe weight training videos. I have avoided cardio like the plague because I truly hate it and my goals have been to gain muscle and strength rather than weight loss. However, I am now 10 months postpartum and still have a ""momma pooch"" even though I'm at my pre-pregnancy weight so I decided its time to add some cardio to my routine. I realize that I am no where near coordinated enough to do Cathe's step aerobic workouts, so I started with her Shock Cardio Hiit and Tabatacise. Both workouts were very intense and burned tons of calories. I did these for two weeks (on Tue/Thu) with my regular weight routine on MWF. After the second week, my knees were killing me. Although I didn't experience any pain during the workout, my knees were aching and popping for a week. I had been an avid runner for years and gave it up due to knee pain. It didn't occur to me that these workouts would be so rough on the joints. (I am only 34 after all)!  Part of the problem may have been the hardwood floors in my house.
I still wanted intense cardio to be part of my routine, so I considered several options: a rebounder, a foam tile mat, or a low impact workout. I actually tried a cheap mini-trampoline from wal-mart with the HiiT workout. It was a definite improvement as far as the impact goes, but I had to be extremely focused not to jump of the trampoline while watching Cathe. So, I decided to try this Low Impact video. I am SO GLAD I DID! At the beginning of the workout, I was thinking, wow, this isn't hard at all! The truth is, it's not hard because its fun! Time flew by as fast as the sweat poured out. It would be easy to add higher impact and modify the workout to make it more difficult if needed. I did the entire video plus the core exercise this morning and now I feel great! This was exactly what I needed to add a little cardio without causing more damage to my joints.
By the way, I couldn't find the gliding discs that Cathe uses, so I bought the Gold's Gym set. They didn't glide very well only hardwood and were worse on carpet. I happened to have two microfiber pads for a Bissell Steam mop that broke years ago. The pads have elastic around the edges and fit perfectly over my size 8 New Balance.  They glide easily and worked great!",1392854400,5,2402,4.265350877192983
8558544,5,B00AWRUVXW,"Don't be deceived by the ""low impact"" in the title.  This is one tough workout!  This little gem utilizes the HIIT method of training.  HIIT stands for high intensity interval training and is considered one of the best ways to burn fat because it increases your body's metabolism.  Plus, it's low impact to boot!

For this workout you'll need:

Light dumbbells; Cathe uses 5 pounds, which is what I used as well.
Step with 2 risers
Gliding discs.

The workout is about 39 minutes long and is divided into 3 sections.  The first section is HIIT floor cardio, the second section uses the step and the third section uses the gliding discs.  Like all the other Xtrain workouts, there are also several premixes, bonus routines and challenges.

Why I love this workout:

* This workout sneaks up on you.  I found the floor cardio section the hardest.  As I went through the step section, I'm thinking, ""This isn't too bad.""  That is until we got to the last routine, supersonic running man.  Yep, it's supersonic all right.  Cathe called it an after party.  More like a gasping party.

* Cathe's form pointers come at just the right time and are spot on.  For example, she tells you to touch your elbows to your knees during the squat kick lunges.  I did that and my muscles started screaming.  It's amazing how just a little form tweak like that can make such a big difference.

* The exercises in the Gliding section required coordination and concentration.  You'll do jumping jacks with lots of arm variations.  It's kind of like walking and chewing gum.  I love working my brain as well as my body during my exercise time.

* The exercises aren't repeated.  I know that ""repetition is the mother of mastery,"" but there are lots of exercises we do during HIIT and Tabata workouts that I don't like because they are really, really hard.  The thought of doing them again is painful.  With this workout, you aren't repeating exercises so the dread factor is not there.

* The pretty brown and teal outfits, with matching sneakers are pleasing to the eye.  How shallow is that:  focusing on the outfits.  But looking at the outfits helped distract me from the `pain' of the workout.

The loud vocals is a minor annoyance in this workout. Cathe got it right this time with the tunes having a driving beat.  I really need a driving beat to get me through tough workouts like this.  However, many of the songs were vocals and because they were so loud, it was sometimes hard to hear Cathe.

I do love these workouts, so when the vocals became loud, instead of being annoyed, I focused on trying to figure out the words to the songs.  This is yet another way to distract myself from the intensity.

I highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting a tough, fun workout that is low impact but certainly not low intensity!",1364083200,2,2810,4.577464788732394
