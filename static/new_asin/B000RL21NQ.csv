The Acting was a bit lousy, but what bothers me the most is there's no soundtrack available, this movie has rare freestyle songs I would love to have, from Chrissy I eece, Mark Anthony Corina ect ect, ... the producers of this film the writers, whatever sound get there act together and release all the songs from this movie, this movie is a classic for many die hard freestyle fans and a soundtrack available would be sweet!",1519603200,,454,4.617283950617284

8201279,5,B000RL21NQ,Giving it 5 stars for the dancing and because Iris Chacon is in it. The acting is bad......porno bad,1474416000,,100,4.315789473684211
8201280,3,B000RL21NQ,"Marc Anthony was the one bright spot in this poorly written screen play.  He plays his part as ""Flaco"" to a T!!  The movie is set around three kids who want to make it big singing their songs.  If it's supposed to be compared to ""West Side Story,"" it misses the mark.",1441670400,,267,4.096153846153846

8201282,5,B000RL21NQ,"What can you say. The music is good & those who can relate to the names surely should have this copy. This has extended parts i never seen before.
Dance music changed from dancing a style called freestlying to listening to the music called Freestyle.
This is all classic Hearthrob, 1018 Days & Acts back from NYC 1987 !!!!",1299456000,2,322,4.47457627118644

8201285,5,B000RL21NQ,"While Marc Anthony is top-billed here, it is clear this movie won't be remembered for him. The dancing in this movie is the real focal point. Unlike the acting and the plot, the dances really do stand out (though you have to get to the latter half of the film to enjoy them). The most unforgettable dance number is Conga, Bongo y Timbal. This number features Iris Chacon, Puerto Rico's inimitable sex symbol. Reported to have measured 36-24-40, she was not shy about wearing bold costumes like the gold ""teddy"" she uses here. This be-thonged costume showcases her legendary posterior end. Before J.Lo, there was Iris. Though J.Lo was more successful, Iris was clearly more, uh, talented (and a better dancer). Is it coincidence that both women have worked with Marc Anthony? Certainly. In short, if you're a fan of Iris Chacon, this DVD is not to be missed.",1191024000,6,857,4.758389261744966
8201286,5,B000RL21NQ,"I have been looking for this on film for the past 5 years and finaly its on dvd, its an old 80s movie so its not the graeatest but if you are a freestyle fan like I am you have to OWN this DVD. AWSOME.",1190937600,3,201,3.488888888888889
