1794220,2,B00006SKVZ,"As I like watching sci-fi movies once in a while, I rented SYNGENOR with no special prejudices in mind. Director George Elanjian Jr.'s filmography includes a few TV shows and two volumes of Playboy Video Magazine. It could be worse, after all. Well, I must admit that I watched SYNGENOR until its end only because of the performance of David Gale who plays a drug addicted director becoming completely insane during the course of the movie. He's really very funny in this role.

The rest of the movie is not so funny mainly because of the editing; it seems that important scenes have been cut or simply not shot by the director. The syngenors are absolutely ridiculous, lacking the zest of humanity that can transform a monster in a creature worthy of staying in the memory of the movie lover. Too bad.

1794221,4,B00006SKVZ,"Syngenor was actually a much better film that I was expecting it to be.  Syngenor, by the way, is short for Synthesized Genetic Organism.  Norton Cyberdyne has designed the soldier of the future, a product of genetic engineering and plain old strong metal engineering, a creature designed specifically to fight in the deserts of the Middle East, a terrible force essentially indestructible.  Unfortunately for all concerned, there is a power struggle taking place in the highest echelons of the company, and the plotters take the bold move of ""accidentally"" letting a Syngenor escape.  When he kills the scientist who essentially created him (and quit before the prototype was really complete), the scientist's niece decides to seek justice on her own.  The police won't investigate the murder, but she knows who and what is responsible.  An annoying reporter looking for a good story joins forces with her, and their efforts lead us into the heart of Norton Cyberdyne.  The president of the company, played by Davie Gale of Reanimator fame, is going quite insane under all the pressure.  As things progress, more and more Syngenors are released to roam the building and basically just kill indiscriminately.  These things are able to reproduce asexually ever twenty-four hours, so you've got Syngenors all over the place pretty quickly.  There is a lot of action, as you can imagine, in the succeeding battles between man and Syngenor.
This movie is basically one of your better than average science fiction B-movies. It was great to see David Gale in action again, but his character actually becomes pretty annoying as his grip on reality quickly weakens.  Gale goes well beyond the call of duty in terms of hamming it up.  The acting is pretty good all the way around, though, and the Syngenor are pretty cool monsters who are much more than guys in rubber suits.  It's always nice when the special effects guys take pride in what they do and give us a creature we can respect rather than laugh at.  Naturally, you pretty much know how things are going to turn out, and you can figure out the Syngenor's vulnerability much more quickly than the desperate heroes who could really use that information do.  The plot does sort of branch off into seemingly important directions that are never expounded upon or explained, but this is forgivable and offset to some degree by the fun mano-a-monster battle scenes.  In the final analysis, Syngenor is a fairly impressive sci-fi B-movie that I found quite entertaining and fun to watch.",1048550400,6,2531,4.947990543735225

7973265,1,B00006SKVZ,"Terrible.  The case art was the best part of this DVD.  This was a bad effort by uncle Jeb and his new camcorder.  He did keep it on a tripod and didn't try to create yet another ""lost footage"" creep show.  I give him credit for that.  But he shouldn't have used acting school rejects who sound like they're reading the lines.  And he should have schooled the guy in the creature suit to attack his victims by using more aggression than just sticking one arm out and having the poor unfortunate maiden to pull the arm in around her and yell AHHHH!  Really.  Stick to growing tomatoes, Jeb, and leave the B movie making to good ole Hollywood!",1433548800,,641,4.3277310924369745
7973266,2,B00006SKVZ,"Third-rate monster film with a good cast. This is actually a semi-sequel to director William Malone's SCARED TO DEATH (1980), but Malone wisely decided against directing this, since it knocks most of the rules he set in the first film on its behind (Malone did design the monster suits, though, the main one worn by Kevin M. Connor). The film open with Norton Cyberdyne executive Stan Armbrewster (Charles 'Chip' Lucia; SOCIETY - 1989), bringing company executive Paula (Riva Spier; GHOSTKEEPER - 1980) and a bimbo and her boyfriend downstairs to celebrate something. A Syngenor (SYNthetic GENetic ORganism) is being held in captivity. It is an alien-like creature that were genetically produced to take the place of soldiers in battle. Since they are asexual, they reproduce every 24 hours. A Syngenor is accidentally let loose, so Paula tells Stan that no outsiders can leave alive, so we see a Syngenor kill the man and his topless bimbo girlfriend. It then gets loose in the city and heads to its creator, Ethan Valentine (Lewis Arquette; THE HORROR SHOW - 1989). It kills Lewis just as niece Susan Valentine (Starr Andreeff; AMITYVILLE: DOLLHOUSE - 1996) comes home and Susan throws a vase of flowers at it and the water in the vase hurts it (Unlike SCARED TO DEATH, where the monster roamed through the sewer tunnels). Norton Cyberdyne president Carter Brown (David Gale; THE BRAIN - 1987) is rapidly going crazy (nobody did crazy like the late David Gale) and keeps injecting some substance behind his ear (it is never explained, although the substance is a neon green, just like in a certain movie Gale starred in) and believes everyone in the company is out to get him (just because you're crazy doesn't mean it's not true). Paula wants all the Syngenors destroyed along with any files pertaining to them, but Susan and nosy reporter Nick Cary (Mitchell Laurance; THE RUNESTONE - 1990) sneak into the company to see what they can find out. Stan tries to get receptionist Bonnie (Melanie Shatner; the running joke is everyone keeps asking her age) to get the files on the Syngenor project downstairs and she accidentally lets loose a whole bunch of Syngenors in the building (and gets electrocuted in the process). Susan learns that the company has also developed a new weapon, called the ""Deathrattle"" before she is spotted by a guard. Rather than go through all the ""people trapped in a building"" stuff, I'll just give you the kills: Syngenors kill a massive amount of security guards before they take the elevator and begin killing upstairs. Carter uses the Deathrattle to make Stan a red stain on the wall. Carter kills the rest of the board members (besides Paula) in the boardroom while wearing a plastic bunny mask on the back of his head (I told you he was crazy!). Paula and the head Syngenor (you'll know it when you see it) are destroyed together by the Deathrattle, but the Syngenor genetically re-assembles itself by using its parts and Paula's parts together and they then squash Carter's head like a bug. Susan remembers that Syngenors are afraid of water (What happens if they were sent to the battlefield in the rain?) so she and Nick turn on the sprinkler system and all the Syngenors dissolve. Oh, and Susan and Nick become lovers. THE END.  Besides the film being boring as hell (William Malone must have read the screenplay by Brent V. Friedman, who also wrote EVIL ALTAR [1987], TICKS [1993] and HELLBOUND [1993]), none of the film makes very much sense. Director George Elanjian Jr. (Who never directed another film, but he was a Key Grip on James Glickenhaus' SUICIDE CULT - 1977) never tries to explain why Paula wants to take over the company, what Carter is shooting behind his ear, why he is going stark raving bonkers, why don't the police want to help especially when there's a massacre going on (especially since one of the Chiefs is friends with Susan) and why the building is so easy to sneak into (The poor black guard who is in charge just up and quits. He was the only one with sense.). The stabs at humor here are pathetic and it is easy to spot where the film was cut to achieve an R-Rating (a scene with an electric drill; Paula's death and Carter's head-squashing among the most apparent). The least the DVD could do was restore these scenes so there would be more gore in the film, but this is just a typical low-rent monster flick from the 90's. Even the much lower budgeted SCARED TO DEATH was 100% better than this. Don't waste your time until a version comes out with the cut scenes restored. Photographed by James Mathers (MEMORIAL VALLEY MASSACRE [1988] and the underrated BRAKE [2012]). A total piece of crap except for Malone's Syngenor suits. Originally available on fullscreen VHS by SouthGate Entertainment. Also starring Jeff Doucette, Bill Gratton; Ken Zavayna, Toy Fegan and Julie Kris. A Synapse Films DVD Release. Rated R.",1422057600,,4887,4.790284360189573
7973267,3,B00006SKVZ,"A weapons corporation manufactures a genetic killing machine, that looks like Predator, but is called Syngenor. Carter Brown (David Gale) is the crazed paranoid man over the project who shoots himself in the neck with the proverbial fluorescent green radiator fluid because...he can. One night he lets loose the Syngenor to test it on live subjects and was surprised for some reason he didn't immediately return to its cage and goes on to kill its creator.

The Syngenor almost kills the niece (Starr Andreeff) whose front door can't be opened from the inside. You always have easy to open doors in case of fire, aliens or Syngenor.  The rest of plot wasn't this tight. It was like an Asylum/ SyFy production.

7973268,4,B00006SKVZ,What made this film so much fun was primarily David Gale's over the top acting in his role.  The rest of the film was fun in a nostalgia (pre CGI) way as well.,1373241600,,159,3.8181818181818183
7973269,5,B00006SKVZ,"Not as good as ""Scared to Death"" but still lots of fun.

7973270,3,B00006SKVZ,"The Synthesized Genetic Organisms (Synegors) created by a corporate weapons manufacturer are set loose to dispose of anyone that stands between the company and its government contracts, and it is up to a reporter and the suspicious daughter of a murdered employee to stop them! SYNGENOR is a perfectly bad B-movie that serves as an entertaining companion piece to CHUD. It refuses to take itself seriously, downplaying its inherently weak plot while indulging in its creature FX and camp. David Gale hams it up as the deranged corporate head responsible for the chaos, becoming the unfortunate result of his own twisted experiments as he continues to inject himself with the Syngenor serum. The creatures are revealed far too soon, exposing them for the cheap rubber knock-offs of Giger's Alien designs that they truly are. Despite the often goofy plot and characters, the film does provide a few laughs and pockets of explosive gore that makes it an enjoyable guilty pleasure, but not one that can be openly recommended to all genre fans.

7973271,3,B00006SKVZ,"Nowhere on the cover art will you see that this film is a sequel to the 1981 film Scared to Death. That's because the media company does not want you to know that is a sequel as people will be less likely to impulse buy if they read that it's a follow-up.  Despite it being a sequel, Syngenor is easily viewed on its own.

Unlike the first film which had 1 Syngenor (SYNthesized GENetic ORganism) running amok, we now get many.  It's a basic story of military creation turning on their creators.  David Gale of Re-Animator makes a likeable over-the-top performance as the heavy in charge of the project (look for many tributes/nods to Re-Animator).

Synapses new Special Edition DVD does beat our Elite's old DVD as the transfer is much better. The special features are basically the same. In my opinion it's not really worth upgrading if you own the old disc but this is a fantastic buy.

Make sure to pick up Retro-media's DVD of Scared to Death while your at it!",1241568000,4,965,4.517241379310345
7973272,3,B00006SKVZ,"SYNGENOR concerns an evil corporation called Norton Cyberdyne that is secretly building synthetic beings to be used as super-soldiers in the coming middle-eastern world war. Shockingly, said beings are released so they can roam around the Cyberdyne building, tearing hapless victims to pieces. This is all done as part of a plot to drive the corporate head Carter Brown (David Gale himself!) bananas. It works. Brown loses his mind entirely, which causes him to grimace, laugh demonically, and to continually ask people to hold him. Gale is all ham, but at least he's good USDA choice ham! He's also the best thing about the movie. As for the monsters themselves, while not a total disgrace, they aren't all that menacing either. The costumes aren't bad, just not very scary or unsettling. Now, there is a scene at the end where one SYNGENOR has a fairly cool meltdown. Anyway, I'd watch this one again as it has it's goofy charms going for it. For extra points, watch for Melanie ""Daughter Of The Shat"" Shatner as Carter Brown's niece! Enjoy...",1209427200,2,1045,4.876404494382022
7973273,4,B00006SKVZ,"I ran across this totally by accident and I am glad I did.  Despite annoying leads, this movie is worth watching for a few reasons.  David Gale as Carter was an absolute hoot.  Man he was funny as the president of the company and he hammed it up to no end.  Then there was Paula played by Riva Spier.  She was dispicable.  You had to love her.  Carter and Paula deserved a movie of there own.  Maybe their eternity together in Hell would make a plot of some kind.  Anyway, the third thing I liked about this film were the creatures, the Syngenors.  No cheesie effects here.  Very well done.  Kind of low budget but very watchable.  The wrap up was predictable but fun.  In fact the whole film was fun.  I just wish the daughter of the scientist who worked on the Syngenor project and the hero reporter she hooks up with weren't so darned annoying.  I cheered more for the evil Paula and the nut case Carter than I did for them.  You know what would have made this one better?  A sequel!!!  Woo-hoo.  Bring it on.  Anyway, if you like 'B' movies this is a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half.",1181520000,,1099,4.1875
