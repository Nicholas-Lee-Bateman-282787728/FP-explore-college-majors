8064730,3,B0009PE73M,"Sally Kirkland followed up her Golden Globe Award Winning and Oscar Nominated Best Actress turn in ""Anna"", with this interesting indie film that co-stars Kathy Bates and a young Sarah Michelle Gellar as her daughter.

Melanie Rose is a Hooker and Stripper with a heart of gold, trapped in a dangerous world of sex, drugs, mobsters, and abuse. As she tries to save her daughter, she finally meets a white collar man, who helps her escape, but not without a price.

If you are a Sally Kirkland fan, you will enjoy this little seen film.",1284854400,2,534,4.610526315789474
