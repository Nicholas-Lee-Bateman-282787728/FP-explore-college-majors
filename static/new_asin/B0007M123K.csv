Only 45 minutes of video, not the advertised 75 minutes. I guess they took into account the ""B Roll"" stuff, which did not look like it was filmed in HD. The production was quite bad as well. Look at desert, look at kangaroos, look at desert, look at more kangaroos. No cities, just outback, a few more animals, and a brief lesson on continental drift and quite repetitive concerning...kangaroos. Don't waste your money in my opinion.",1196121600,23,634,6.458823529411765
2219555,3,B0007M123K,I expected more video of some of the scenic areas in Australia. This DVD focuses on the animals in Australia and the terrain. I was hoping it would include something on the Great Barrier Reef but it didn't. The video was good quality and the narration was informative.,1195430400,13,268,4.604166666666667
2219556,4,B0007M123K,"This was not exactly what I expected.  Since I've been planning a trip Down Under, I thought the movie would showcase some of the more popular places that people would visit, so I could get a visual of what I was hoping to see while there.  Instead I got more of a National Geographic flora/fauna of the outback, perspective.  It is a great film about the outback, its wildlife and climate, but for tourism information it doesn't have what I was looking for to help plan my trip.",1168300800,4,479,4.420454545454546
2219557,4,B0007M123K,"I gave this DVD as a birthday present to a friend who was planning a trip to Australia within a couple of months.  I have not seen the documentary and can only comment on my friend's reaction to watching it frequently before her trip.  She was pleased with the information, scenery, and especially the animals on the film. She has a hectic schedule and little time for TV and films.  However, she commented several times how much she was enjoying this DVD.  She's in Australia now, so I'll have to wait until she returns to find out if it helped her during the trip.",1162512000,2,566,4.413461538461538
2219558,4,B0007M123K,"Very good film about Australia. I would have liked more scenes and info about marsupials and other exotic Australian animals, but any how, this is a great documentary.  Totally recommended.",1156550400,4,189,5.3
2219559,3,B0007M123K,"Land yes, people no.......????

this video shows the beautiful and interesting land and land creatures of the continent but fails to show that it is inhabited at all.  I expected some views of the aboriginals and their history, some mention at least.  But by watching this video you have no idea that humans exist on the continent AT ALL!

I loved the segments of the formation of the continent, the kangaroos, the birds... but after 30 minutes of this I expected to see the Great Barrier reef, the inhabited areas and some other aspects of Australia. I was left very unfulfilled.  Too bad.",1148428800,8,590,4.689320388349515
2219560,5,B0007M123K,Incredible scenery from down under! I particularly enjoyed the underwater life and underground insect scenes. Transitions are so smooth and the music ...so relaxing.,1132876800,6,165,5.916666666666667
2219561,5,B0007M123K,"I am so impressed with this movie. The production is truly amazing. I feel like I traveled to Australia for 1 1/2 hrs and flew over that vast land of natural wonders. I loved the Kangoroo and Koala scenes as well as the underwater scenes. The film succeeds in almost every aspect, including its sound effects and truly delightful music score. As opposed to other IMAX films that use cheap background music or music by classic rock bands, here we get a one-of-a kind music score performed by an orchestra that blends with the images really well. The narrative script provides a lot of information while keeping the viewer entertained (like the Kangoroo kickboxing scene) Also, the picture quality was amazing! At times I wondered if I was watching a plain DVD or some sort of high definition video!!",1128211200,22,798,4.748201438848921
2219562,5,B0007M123K,"Extraordinary panoramic vistas, taken from a 2-engine plane with a camera attached to its nose, amazing geological facts, and marvelous animals, most of them unique to Australia, are what we get in this superb documentary of what is both the world's smallest continent, and its largest island. Once joined to Antarctica many millions of years ago, with high mountains and lush forests, time transformed Australia into 3 million square miles of mostly arid flat land, and its creatures adapted to the different weather conditions. Fabulous and often amusing footage of kangaroos and koalas (both share the same ancestral marsupial possum), as well as desert creatures from ants to the giant and fearsome parenti lizard, and the ""living contradiction,"" the platypus, are among the many delights shown in this film.

An event that only occurs approximately twice every century, torrential rains filling the Outback's Lake Eyre, bringing long dormant animals to life, as well as flocks of pelicans, is caught on film, and is a spectacular sight. This is a glorious but harsh land, with a strange beauty that fills the soul. Australia is described as being more like another planet than another country, and this documentary has many images rarely seen.

Directed by David Flatman, written by Flatman, Meg Morrison, and poet Les Murray, it is narrated by Alex Scott, and has a lovely score by David Bridie.  Made for IMAX in 2002, every aspect of ""Australia, Land Beyond Time"" is excellent, is a must for anyone interested in this great country, and those of us who like to explore foreign lands without leaving home.",1127606400,51,1612,5.0754716981132075
2219563,2,B0007M123K,"Once again, an IMAX documentary where the only thing that seems to matter are pretty pictures. While the image quality is superb it's the only real redeeming feature.  There's no real exploration of the ecology of the Outback, there isn't much discussion of the wildlife (yay, kangaroos, yay perenties). What discussion there is is basic, repetitive and about on par with what you'd get in a 3rd or 4th grade science class.  It's amazingly pretty, but there's nothing else there.  It's like a screen saver for your TV basically.
The subtitles were also horrible; words were misspelled, just flat out missing, sometimes out of sync with the audio... I use subtitles because my hearing is  so/so, and that was a real pain for me.",1243728000,,727,4.838709677419355
2219564,4,B0007M123K,"I give this one three and a half stars. Great I-Max photography as usual, however maybe just not enough time to cover more of Australia, being such a vast land. Seemed to be focused on just a few points. But, great family show. Glad to have it in the collection.",1236643200,,262,4.26
2219565,1,B0007M123K,"The cover says this is a 75 minute DVD.  Well, the program is only the usual IMAX 40+ minute version.  Also, this says ""large format widescreen"" and ""16x9 widescreen"" format.""  It would have been better quality if they stuck with the original IMAX dimensions, as this low-detail letterbox is not anamorphic and has relatively low quality by today's standards (it has been for some years now!).  The program itself is OK to good in places but not exceptional.  Some years ago (right after VHS), this would have been acceptable.  Production standards have increased substantially (see BBC productions like Planet Earth and Galapagos, for example).",1233619200,2,645,5.153846153846154

2219567,5,B0007M123K,"As an ex-patriate Australian living in the USA, it made me very homesick.

Beautifully composed, with a wonderful dialogue (though done by an Englishman for international appeal, I think) and technically correct, it should be part of all Elementary Schools' video library!",1223596800,,272,5.476190476190476
2219568,3,B0007M123K,"I enjoyed this Imax presentation. The piture quality in the 45 min main feature is pin sharp, although it becomes a bit soft on the Imax ""big horizon"" flying scenes, the sound clear and powerful.
It presents a good insight to the history and evolution of the landscape and the animals in the various zones around Australia.
Additional features included a making of and a B roll, presented in std def and didn't add much to the package.",1221264000,2,435,4.589743589743589

2219570,5,B0007M123K,"This film gives a stunningly beautiful view of the landscapes and wildlife of Australia, with an interesting, informative narration.  Anyone who is fascinated by Australia and the natural world will love this continent-wide visual tour.  It's the sort of film you can watch again and again.  Well worth the purchase price.",1199836800,,322,5.2745098039215685
2219571,1,B0007M123K,"I bought this DVD in anticipation of migrating to Australia. I was expecting a well balanced documentary about Australia: history, wildlife, people, cultures etc. The DVD promises 74 min, so it should be able to cover all that. But after about 30 minutes of in itself interesting material, the DVD was done already. I felt very disappointed, as I expected many more minutes and much more than just a few animals and even some repeating scenes.",1199232000,6,443,4.842105263157895
2219572,2,B0007M123K,"I was disappointed with the DVD, of course the IMAX format is great, stunning images...but there is no life. It comes across as an infomercial on Australia, and we have seen most of the areas pictured many times. Very superficial.
I love Australia, a great place to visit, I wanted more of the people, more of the country, more of the history...",1196812800,3,345,4.580645161290323

8048734,5,B0007M123K,"One of my all-time favorites. There is no narration, but the music and the visuals are beautiful. Gives the viewer the wide scope of Australia without  getting into the same hackneyed stuff other films do. Used in classes for World Geography and the students love it",1423008000,,266,4.782608695652174
8048735,4,B0007M123K,"This was a christmas present for a 10 year old that is fascinated with the fact that her uncle is living and working in Australia.  It was great in the fact that it didn't provide just the touristy information about Sydney and Melbourne, but described the continent as whole and provided history as well.  We purchased additional information as well to accompany the video.",1419897600,,373,4.8125
8048736,5,B0007M123K,"I first saw this IMAX movie while I was in Australia (how perfect, right?), and was absolutely blown away by it.  It was stunningly beautiful and also gave me a window into the environment and animals of Australia, and how those animals adapt to survive in the harsh and unforgiving world that is the Outback.  This film also brings the viewer inside the lush rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and discusses how the continent of Australia is more like another planet than just another continent.

The photography is stunning.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Like in most IMAX movies, the viewer feels as if he/she is THERE, part of the landscape and/or packs of animals.  I was blown away by what I saw on the IMAX screen, and was very excited to watch it (many a time now!) on my OWN screen.",1393804800,,787,4.666666666666667
8048737,5,B0007M123K,Thoroughly enjoyed this.  It gives one a real sense of what unusual things there is to see and do there.,1377216000,,104,4.2

8048739,5,B0007M123K,"I originally saw this movie on a recent trip through Central Australia whilst visiting the reptile park in Alice Springs. The movie provides a natural history of the continent that is Australia with great insight and photography. I would highly recommend this DVD being used in all schools as it is a truly superb production.

8048740,3,B0007M123K,"I purchased this DVD since my son was going to do a sememster abroad in Australia. We watched it together and all I could say afterwards is,""Is that it!"" Not really worth the purchase. I went to the library afterwards and watched many more interesting DVDs for free.",1265760000,,266,4.5625
8048741,2,B0007M123K,"This is 40 minutes of video of Australia - mostly of the interior and some coastline shots.  Probably better than the average tourist home movie - but not by much.  Some of the scenes probably looked impressive on an IMAX screne, which is apparently what it was made for.  In 16:9 it's between 'nice' and 'interesting' but far from stunning.

A LOT of kangaroo footage - some bird (mostly flock) foootage.  One crocodile snippet that was a big animal.  A few lizard shots.  Some scenic storm scenes.

Unctious narration by Alex Scott - I couldn't take him twice but it depends on what you like I suppose.  The back says 75 minutes but that must be with the bonus material.

I think it's worth a few $ but never $22 (to me)!  Of the half dozen Australia videos I have, this is the bottom of the heap.  Get it (only) if you collect everything you can find on Australia.",1264464000,,867,4.383647798742138
