2248293,5,B0007XG266,"The Batman is a great series for kids, hands down. The animation and character style is refreshing and the stories have been simplified for its audience. It's nice to see a different take on the character and villains. It would have been too easy for The WB to just rehash the old BTAS with the same style and storylines that introduced some of the most bizarre characters in the Batman universe (Etrigan The Demon and the much more darker versions of the rogues gallery) but the audience they are after is young children not grown up adolescents and die-hard Batman enthusiasts in their 30's and 40's that believe Batman has to always be dark and brooding. Yes, that is how he is in the comic book and movies but this is a cartoon. I for one have loved every version of Batman that has graced the screen and while some are not as good as others one should appreciate that the character has the ability to reach generation after generation.",1114473600,12,940,4.535294117647059
2248294,4,B0007XG266,"I gave the series 4 stars.

I like the direction the writers are going with this series.

The animation is sharp.

I loved the old BTAS, and I believe this series complements the old Batman series well.",1111536000,8,202,4.405405405405405
2248295,1,B0007XG266,"The Batman is WB's current hot, hip action show, completely tossing out the classic, definitive animated Batman from a few years earlier and reimagining him as a younger, less brooding, hipper, cooler toy-selling crime-fighting hero. If that's too much 'hip' for you, it's because the exces seem to think that a Bruce Wayne who listens to pop music and tosses quips out like Spider-Man will make up for the lack of story and characterization in this show.

The Batman's strong points are in its art style and animation. The animation is fluid and engaging, doing things you wish the better Justice League series could do with its limited budget. The art style, rather than mimicking the designs of Bruce Timm, goes in a completely different direction by making the characters more grotesque and exaggerated. It might not work for everyone, but it's still appealing in an 'Elseworlds' kinda way. Jeff Matsuda's work is commendable.

But there's still that issue of story and character, and The Batman really provides neither. Granted some of the early BTAS episodes were mediocre too, but the horrible dialogue here (delivered by experienced but miscast voice actors) is really what makes it so painful to watch. The show is worth checking out once just to see the designs and animation, but it's not worth owning, and in no way worth the 3 episodes/disc investment WB is asking from you. Grab the BTAS sets instead.",1110153600,42,1415,4.9411764705882355

2248297,5,B0007XG266,"I grew up watching Batman on TV and have always liked the show. They bring back so many memories and I suddenly noticed things about the show today that I had never noticed before. For instance, Mr. Freeze is the only villain who didn't have a girl by his side as all of the other villains did. Also, the series never really showed us how the villains became the villains that they are, with the exception of the college professor who was struck on the head by a flower pot and believed that he was King Tut. But, all in all, the series is awesome. Thank you for the quick delivery.",1486252800,,582,4.252252252252252

One of the concerns was the missing content I'd read about, which was resolved through Warner's replacement program.  When I finally ordered Season One, selecting the Jan 20, 2015 release instead of Nov 11, 2014, the corrected disc was already part of this set.

2248327,5,B0007XG266,"This was a Christmas gift for a 5 year boy who loves Batman!

I watched 2 episodes with him and he was bouncing off the walls he was so happy. The picture was nearly as good as the Blu-Rays I've bought for myself. Sound was great as well. And the price INCLUDING S/H was **UNDER** $10. You  just can't beat that with a stick!!!!!

His mom has called and thanked us - apparently he watches as least one episode a night after supper. I guess I will have to buy him the rest of the series for his birthday this summer.

I would rate this a very good 8.75 to 9.25 out of 10 - nearly any young child will like this and many older adults (you know who you are!) will have fond memories of this 1960's show!. Highly recommended!!!",1452038400,5,723,4.1063829787234045

2248332,4,B0007XG266,"For the first two seasons, this is a very good show but it's destined to be nitpicked by fans of Batman the Animated Series.  Frankly, Batman is easier to relate to in this version because he hasn't given up on being a human being.  Bruce Wayne actually has a friend or two when he isn't hanging out in the Batcave or fighting crime.  The police are trying to arrest Batman as some of his more dangerous foes begin appearing for the first time in Gotham.  The show's only crime is that it looks different and to fans of the other show, different = bad.  The character designs aren't perfect but as a whole, this series has a more modern feel and the action benefits from advances in animation.  (Look at the first episodes of Batman the Animated Series and you'll see what I mean).  This show wasn't content to recycle the art-deco look of BTAS and I was surprised that they managed to get so much right while making Batman feel a little new again.",1446249600,3,948,4.382857142857143

2248358,1,B0007XG266,"After watching Batman: The Animated Series (BTAS) This show has been such a disappointment. BTAS was widely praised for its thematic complexity, dark tone, and high artistic quality. Written for both adults and kids. It was the best Batman show. ""The Batman"" pales in comparison to the classic. Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of Batman. Mark Hamill is the definitive Joker.

They've ruined several characters such as Mr. Freeze. The deep tragic character from BTAS and reduced him to a common jewel thief. Pathetic.",1423785600,,521,5.129411764705883

2248367,1,B0007XG266,"There is little I can say about this series. This The Batman: The Complete First Season (2004-2005) is very poorly drawn, has unsympathetic characters, crudely portrayed, simply awful villains. The usual Gothamite villains appear in this season, The Joker twice, The penguin twice, one Catwoman episode, Mr. Freeze, The Ventriloquist, Clayface, Bane, and a few others. Has a new character, Detective Lin, which I don't like much, also Officer Bennett, who becomes Clayface in ""The Clay Face of Tragedy"" episode. The only episodes worth a glance are Call of the Cobblepot, The Big Chill, The Cat and the Bat (by far the best episode), Topsy Turvy (extremely weird), and The Clay Face of Tragedy. The Joker in this series is repulsive and grotesque and is not appealing as a villain. Batman himself has no charisma, and the cast themselves have no appeal. The DVD has several extra features, New Look, New Direction, New Knight, Gotham PD Case files: Highly Confidential profile of villains, flatly narrated by Det. Lin, Building the Batman (an advertisement for Mattel), and no less than 4 games--yuck! Obviously designed for little kids who have no taste or knowledge of good animation and only want to play games. Simply not worth buying.",1403740800,2,1239,5.048780487804878
2248368,4,B0007XG266,"The series, ""The Batman"" is still Batman.  A younger Bruce Wayne is fighting crime.  This incarnation features many more gadgets (designed for selling toys, no doubt!) and less detective work.  Character development is limited as well, except in the case of the detectives.  This is a pre-commisioner Gordon Gotham city, and there's no Robin either.  While this works, the aim of the show is clearly a little younger demographic than Batman: The Animated Series (or maybe it's the same, we've just lowered our standards..or raised them...).

Now we have to explain.

If it's for kids, and it is, it's surprising that Robin doesn't show up until much later in the series.  This means that Batman has to be more kid-friendly, thus there is a lot more action than the dark and gritty Batman of the 90's series.

As far as standards - the story lines suffer in depth.  This also a Gotham mostly without guns.  In fact, the police force carries around these laser-gun looking things instead of the old revolvers that were okay in the 90's for animated cops to carry around.

Batman has new gadgets, and the villains are sillier in their ""crimes"" and even worse in their puns.

Still, it's a Batman for a new set of kids and he doesn't disappoint.",1397865600,,1241,4.716279069767442

2248370,5,B0007XG266,"If you love Batman I highly recommend this series.  It's a fresh start for Gotham's vigilante, meaning he has no relationship with the police, is still working on his crime fighting skills, and making his name known on the streets.  I love this series and have seen it from beginning to finish.  It's fairly dark but not so dark it's not kid friendly.  The character's have some great depth and back stories.  It even goes into the back stories of several of the villains which is nice for those who aren't as familiar with the comic books.  I'm sure they're not all 100% accurate but it's always bizarre when you're introduced to a series and no one tells you if anything's different or not.

The story and pacing is a little more intense because Batman is fighting not only the villains but also the cops as they chase him through the streets of Gotham.  Great animation and great voice acting.  I highly recommend this series!",1393459200,,929,4.581818181818182

It is good on it's own; but that it deviated from what was done befor in the Animated Series I think shows how much open interpetation the character allows and remains the Batman.
The show is more anime than others but do not be fooled the writing is good and the animation is mor than watchable.
The characterts are drawn well and look cool. Some of the new looks and personalities may surprise you but go with it and enjoy the difference.",1381968000,2,589,4.412844036697248

The animation for the fight scenes look great, but villains aren't very interesting.  They are all just crooks.  Stealing to steal with no real motivations.  Some of the redesigns work and others don't. Mr. Freeze looks great, but Catwoman looks like a mouse.  There is only one stand out moment in this season. Joker proves he's right, all it takes is one bad day to change an ordinary person into a monster. That one episode gives me hope for the series.",1376006400,,618,4.572727272727272
2248377,4,B0007XG266,"The reason that this show works for me is because I didn't grow up watching Batman: The Animated Series. That show was before my time and the only cartoons I could watch as a kid were on local channels on Saturday morning. This was one of my favorite shows, and I still appreciate it.

It's not perfect, and most would view it as cartooney and made to sell kid's toys. This is true, but the show uses it's ""cartooney"" feel for more fluid action sequences that would otherwise be harder or impossible to animate in a show like this. It also has a lot of style and the re-imagining of characters may either come of as insulting or a fresh take to Batman fans. I find this version of the Joker to be much different than any other version I've seen but he still very much seems like The Joker and I like him for what he is. The show (mind you in the first 3 seasons) has a surprising dark feel that I really like. I would not recommend watching season 4 or 5 though because at that point it looses all the dark and gritty style that the show had going for it, and the addition of Robin just made the show a lot less appealing with it's immature humor and light-hearted tone.

To conclude, I would just say that if you were a fan of the old show you probably will have a hard time liking this one, maybe not, but that seems common. But if you aren't attached to that show then you might want to give this show a chance. The characters and action are very enjoyable. Just steer away from season 4 and 5 and you'll be ok. If you enjoy animated shows like Teen Titans, or The Spectacular Spiderman, you might want to give this one a look.",1376006400,,1630,4.171428571428572

2248380,3,B0007XG266,"This Batman cartoon has a lot to live up to, and maybe that's what's wrong, fans think Batman cartoon, they think the 90's cartoon.  It may not be a contender for best of anything, but this batman cartoon tries it's best at times, it just has a goofy feel to it.  I do wish Ming-Na Wen stayed on the show though, but she left after season 2 to work on a short lived show called, ""Vanished"" ironically what happened to both her character and that show, they just simply vanished.  But don't let that stop you from watching the show, however Commissioner Gordon doesn't show up until season 3.  Towards the end, it focus' on Batman teaming with other superheroes of the DC universe.  Overall the is ""okay"" to me, it's worth watching if your bored, also Two-Face isn't in this show.",1371340800,,779,4.457746478873239

This cartoon, like many other remakes, was dumbed down for Generation Y. Instead of the complicated machinations that were present in the 1990's series, every episode consists of Batman stopping a villain from his lame, predictable scheme. Even the intro theme song sucks. However, there are some watchable episodes in this series (especially in the later seasons). I liked the Batman-Superman team up (when all else fails, that's a good way to get ratings). In conclusion, this is not the worst cartoon ever, but the 1990's series puts this to shame. And why does the Joker look like Bob Marley?",1354838400,,769,4.877862595419847

2248394,4,B0007XG266,"Let's clear the air immediately, I do subscribe to the cliche that this series is not as good as Batman, The Animated Series (B:TAS)(1992-1995), or its spin-offs (aka the ""Timmiverse""). But I thoroughly enjoy this series, also. I actually rented this first season before purchasing all five seasons and its one DTV movie (hence the 1/6 in this review title), so that should tell you how I feel overall.

**Potential Spoilers Below** I don't seek to ruin large revelations, but for the sake of telling what I like and what I don't, there may be some potential spoilers, depending on how you view that term.

I had tried watching The Batman a time or two during its first run, but at that time I thought that Kevin Conroy was Batman, Mark Hamill was The Joker, etc., and there was no one else for those parts. After really liking the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series, which featured at times, other actors portraying the Bat, and after reading about it some before giving it another chance, there were some things that piqued my interest enough to give it a shot. Specifically, the re-imagining of the villains.

What I liked after actually watching Season One, is the fact that you're seeing Batman in his third year; he's not going to just run in and always have an easy time disabling the henchmen. In this season, he's also not quite the detective that is, to me, a large part of who Batman is. There seems to be a large dependence on gadgets; I've read where that is a sore point for some. I couldn't help but think it's James Bond meets Batman, which was a different but not a bad take on the character. As far as villains go, Mr. Freeze is less the tragic figure B:TAS had (re)envisioned him to be, and more the straight criminal. Also Firefly didn't have much face time in the ""Timmiverse"" and while he is only featured once during this season, he made further appearances in following seasons. Overall, it is a good opening season. It is ideal for any 7 yr old plus child who likes the character, while still remaining entertaining for older fans. (I bought it for me, a 34 yr old) However older fans should keep in mind that its target audience is the younger age group.",1330387200,4,2189,4.550761421319797
2248395,5,B0007XG266,"This series is geared toward kids, so ignore the bad reviews if you are parents whose kids love The Batman. Our 3 and 6 year old kids LOVE this series and now Mom & Dad are hooked, as well. It's fun, quirky and shows Bruce as a 26 year old newbie to the whole Batman concept. Season 1 starts when he has been fighting crime for just 3 years. Yes, the villans are odd, but far more interesting to young kids. The jokes are clean and although there is a fair amount of violence, the characters deliver simple lines that young kids can follow.

If you're an adult looking to relive your childhood, choose another series. If you're open to a new concept (Batman's early years), then grab this one and you won't be disappointed! We need to buy Season 2 because I can't stand the suspense any longer.",1329177600,2,794,4.328859060402684

2248402,4,B0007XG266,"The first season of The Batman is weak but not as weak as some of the seasons to come. Sure season 1 has problems but it wasn't that bad of a season. Let's jump in!

The animation (and this goes for subsequent seasons as well) always looked great in this series. The landscape, the fight sequences and character design. Though done in an anime-esque style (reminding me a lot of Jackie Chan Adventures), the characters still had a resemblance (vague for some characters however; ex. Cluemaster) when I compare it to the actual anime seen in Gotham Knight. And while its not the ""classic"" Batman look that the nineties animated series had, I grew to like the designs, except for one and that was Catwoman. Her costume didn't even resemble a cat, well the mask part anyway. She looked like a mouse with overgrown ears! Batman/Bruce Wayne and Alfred have almost no change done to them whatsoever when compared to other designs, though Batman's cape is a little longer but it does look good when he's jumping about the buildings. The Joker design startled me at first and I was a little off put by his wardrobe in the first episode but by the time he reappeared again, he was back in his traditional (for this show anyway) outfit (though the straightjacket look would reappear one more time in season 2) and I was happy. Though for the life of me I'll never understand why they didn't give him any shoes. Penguin's back to his Danny DeVito look and it kind of works for this series over its predecessor. Though he looked deformed in B:TAS, he still acted and dressed like a refined gentleman of crime. The only off putting thing about Penguin is the oversized hat and his coattails dragging on the ground. Firefly is another villain that got a decent upgrade; from a man in a metal suit and helmet to a guy in a flying bug suit (though you'd think that the giant light on the costume would slow him down and the ""flying"" effect did get annoying) Another negative thing to point out is that this version of Gotham is the least populated. I've never seen a city so empty before in my life (except London in The Avengers but they were striving for a ""fantasy"" approach to that series).

Voice acting however was not the strong point for this season though Rino Romano and Kevin Michael Richardson are good as Batman and Joker, respectively. Steve Harris and Ming-Na do great jobs as Det. Ethan Bennett and Ellen Yin but special praise for Harris during the two-part season finale. He really brings out Ethan's turmoil as he goes from being tortured at the hands of Joker to having his morals confused after being turned into Clayface. Tom Kenny's Penguin is a little more obnoxious than Paul Williams' interpretation but it does reflect the design of the character. Kenny's Penguin, while obnoxious, is far more vicious than Williams and he does bring back the ""Penguin laugh"" that Burgess Meredith had done back in the sixties. Clancy Brown's Mr. Freeze, while not as sympathetic, is still pretty menacing but the ice puns wear thin (though that's more of the writer's fault for watching too much Batman & Robin). James Marsden's Firefly is actually sounds pretty tough to the bland rendition we got before. The only voice I didn't like was Gina Gershon as Catwoman. It sounds like she's trying to be mysterious and sexy but it sounds like she's imitating Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. And special mention to Adam West as Mayor Grange, who would end up being an underused character until he is replaced in season 5.

The writing was something that would improve as time went on. This series starts with Batman in his third year of crime-fighting and he's eliminated most, if not all, of Gotham's organized crime. That is until some costumed clown and a host of other costumed criminals showed up. While the first season mainly set up Batman's encounters with his infamous Rogues Gallery, those would be the strong points. Well every time except Q&A, which is probably the worst episode of the series (though that's probably debatable). Every time he's with Alfred and they talk about ""The Batman"", they refer to him in the third person as if he's a different character. Exchanges such as;

Bruce: I'm thinking about letting Ethan into the fold.
Alfred: You mean someone other than me would know The Batman's identity?

Um, he's standing right in front of you, why didn't you just say ""your identity"". Another irking thing that would pop up in episodes would be Alfred irking Bruce to lead a normal life such as signing him up on a dating website or implying that he needs to be a ""full time Bruce Wayne"". He's been with him all of his life and knows he's committed to his cause so why try and change his mind. He even admits in one episode that even if Bruce did listen to him, Alfred would regret it. I know in other versions, Alfred has implied that it would be good for Bruce to let go and live a normal life but he's never been a nag about it. There were only four episodes, to me anyway, that were standout this season. First is ""The Big Heat"", which features Batman's first encounter with Firefly. The subplot deals with Bruce trying to convince the city council members that he's just as capable of running the children's hospital as his father had been. While he does achieve it in the end, when he fails, you can see the disappointment in his face, thinking that he's let down the memory of his father. Second is ""The Big Dummy"" and, like ""Heat"", features the Caped Crusader fighting the Ventriloquist and Scarface. While it ends up being a ""villain with a gimmick"" episode, I like how it touches upon Ventriloquist's split personality which would unfortunately be touched upon one other time in season 3. Lastly is the two-part season finale ""The Rubberface of Comedy""/""The Clayface of Tragedy"", wherein it starts out as a villain-gimmick episode, it turns into how Ethan Bennett falls from grace and turns into the villainous Clayface. A real tragic character as all season you see him debating about Batman and whether he thinks this vigilante does any good in the city only to become one of the very people he fights. This would be a semi-arc that would continue for a couple of seasons.

All in all, season 1 was weak but, like Justice League, it did improve over time.",1285372800,6,6274,4.637589928057554
2248403,4,B0007XG266,"I am one who feels that you have to have an open mind when watching this animated series from its inception.  I (personally) like the ENTIRE series from season 1 - 5!!  Of course, Season 1 might be the weakest, but it's still very good in my opinion.  I love how they develop the character (obviously we are looking at a much younger/greener Bruce Wayne character).  Over the years it develops and matures (he does as well as the writing and the series in general). I have been watching the entire series from start to finish and I am very pleased with it.  This is coming from a die-hard fan of the original animated series.  Quick shout out to the ""Brave and the Bold"" as well.  All great Batman movies.

2248404,4,B0007XG266,"As a tween in the 70's I lost interest in comics as I began to realize that women were often portrayed in degrading ways (sadly a trend that is still very much alive and kicking).

Over the years I'd heard about Batman's new gritty relaunch, read some of the stuff, and didn't care for it (if I wanted gritty realism, why would I be reading comics? I can turn on the news for free.)

But I've been very much enjoying ""The Batman"" animated series on Boomerang. The depiction of Bruce Wayne seems to strike a perfect note - dark enough to take him seriously, yet still recognizably a human being (glory be, he even cracks a smile now and then!) Detective Yin is a strong, intelligent female character, and for the most part women are not portrayed with the impossible physiques and clingy clothes that characterized ""Batman - the Animated Series"".

I've enjoyed ""The Batman"" so much I'm considering buying the complete series - which will be the first DC-related purchase I've made in years.",1266278400,,989,4.64
2248405,4,B0007XG266,"Having previously done Batman The Animated Series (1992-95), Warner Brothers new animated series featuring Batman takes a new approach, with a fresh spin on the character.  In The Batman (2005), millionaire Bruce Wayne is 26, and has been operating as a masked crimefighter for just three years.  Regarded by the police as a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands, Batman is an outlaw.  Faithful Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennywell is a younger, tech savvy fellow, who takes a very active part in assisting young Bruce in all he does.

This is an intriguing approach to the character, and one where the perspective is distinctly modern, and overwhelmingly high tech.  The Batman utilizes a plethora of tools, gadgets and weapons.  The Batmobile is completely remote controllable, racing through the streets without a driver.  Achieving flight using various mechanical devices, and even donning a mechanized armored Batbot suit, this version of Batman makes such extensive use of technology, that he approaches possessing superpowers.

No matter the time period, utilizing the latest in technology and science, is natural to Batman, although whether this exaggerated version goes too far, is open to question.  While some may find the extensive integration of technology interesting, those who favor a more traditional interpretation, may be appalled by the changes to the parameters of the Batman universe.  For a character that is over 60 years old, change is almost inevitable.  The program also provides new interpretations of some of Batman's classic villains.

The action is usually fast paced, with some compelling stories.  The episode `Call Of The Cobblepot', features an interesting look at the origin of The Penguin.  Bane makes an explosive and terrifying appearance in `Traction'.  In `The Cat And The Bat', Catwoman exposes the Batman's dependence on technology, when she steals his utility belt and takes control of the Batmobile and other devices.  Firefly makes an impressive debut in `The Big Heat', as a villain with remarkable technical expertise and deadly laser weapons.  And for a journey into to absurd, there is `Q&A', which features The Cluemaster, an intellectual giant who holds a grudge, and has an imaginative plan to extract his revenge.

The Batman is high on police Chief Angel Rojas's most wanted list, with detectives Ellen Yin and Ethan Bennett, often assigned to cases involving The Bat.  Bennett is a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, who as an unfortunate victim of the Joker's putty, is transformed into Clayface.  Detective Yin loses her partner in the season finale, but also gains The Batman's trust, setting the stage for their loose partnership in season two.

The series is a bold strike in a new direction, with very nicely done animation, however Batman's heavy reliance on technology, reshapes the way he operates, and at times completely takes over the proceedings.  Each iteration of Batman has its fans and detractors, and there are positives and negatives about this version, which would continue to evolve during its five season run.  Because of the violence, and mildly adult themes, this program is not really suitable for young children.  The collection has a nice set of extras, including a couple of quizzes.",1264896000,,3275,5.206106870229007

2248410,4,B0007XG266,"I remember when this show first came out, I wanted nothing to do with it. I remember thinking ""wow, looks like a campy version of the 90's show"". Well, I hate to admit when I'm wrong but here it goes... I was wrong. I've always been a batman fan. As a kid I would watch the 90's show every chance I got. Like every batman fan, I was so excited when ""The Dark Knight"" came out. After I saw it twice in the theater, I pulled out my old graphic novels and re-read them. I also pulled out my 90's animated series dvds and re-watched those. I read some reviews of ""The Batman"" and after seeing the first season at the store for 12.99, I decided why not. While there are some flaws with this series, at least in the first season, there are some great pros. I was one of the ones that HATED the way the new joker looked, but to be honest, this joker seems more like the joker from the comics then the other one from the old series ever did. He seems crazier, like he doesn't care to get caught or not, and after a while his looks grows on you. My only complaint is that it gets a little redundant after a while. Some of the episodes almost seem similar, just with a different bad guy. We have to remember though that this is the first season and lets be honest, the first season of the original batman series had its flaws.

These are My top five favorite episodes of this season.
1. The Bat in the Belfry (Classic Joker)
2. The Rubberface of Comedy/ The Clayface of Tragedy
3. Traction
4. The Big Heat
5. The Man Who Would be Bat

So, there you have it. I would highly recommend this. I am in the process of watching the second season and once it is done, I will make sure to write a review for it also.

oh yeah, another problem I had with it is Mr. Freeze. They went with the classic story of his character instead of the poetic one made in The Animated Series, and it really doesnt work. The writing in that episode is terrible also because there are a bunch of bad ""ice"" puns throughout the whole thing, it almost feels like you are watching the Batman and Robin movie again.",1218153600,3,2073,4.138957816377172
2248411,5,B0007XG266,"In the first season of The Batman, Batman is Batman, year three. At 26, he's still a little rough around the edges but, definitely, honing his craft as a crimefighter. He goes up against the likes of The Joker, Penguin, Catwoman, Firefly, Man-Bat(one of my all-time favorite Batman villans), The Ventriloquist(the other all-time favorite), Clayface, Rupert Thorne, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and Cluemaster. Vocal talent was provided by: Rino Romano, Adam West(TV's live-action Batman of the 60s), Alastair Duncan, Victor Brandt, Kevin Michael Richardson, Gina Gershon, Clancy Brown,  Steve Harris, Jason Marsden, Dan Castellaneta, Peter MacNicol, Glenn Shadix, Joaquim de Almeida and Mr. Hellboy,himself, Ron Perlman. In my opinion, the first season shows a more lighter humorous side of Batman but the episodes are great,nonetheless. My favorite episodes were, of course, the ones featuring Man-Bat & The Ventriloquist. With The Batman, you'll notice a huge difference in artistic styles for the show as opposed to Batman: The Animated Series. It also has a more adult tone to it than anything that has previously came before it. I really enjoyed season one and will continue to add the show to my collection.

2248414,3,B0007XG266,"The Batman is not and will never be Batman: TAS.  Bruce Timm did a wonderful job creating that masterpiece and I doubt it will ever be duplicated.  The first season of The Batman however gives a reason to hope for another good batman series.

Until the last two episodes, this would've been in 1-2 star territory.  Some of the villain ""updates"" are atrocious and those episodes are not very fun to watch.  Scarface is a hip gangster-pimp that creates a robot version of himself, Mr. Freeze is some kind of weird wizard and has lost all three-dimensionality, and the Penguin is a martial arts master?  In the extras a creator talks of how fun they thought it would be if the Penguin was this amazing fighter, how that would add some ""pop"" to this character.  What an awful decision.  These visions of great villains are garbage and the shows greatest failing.

The Joker, though radically different, is not so poorly done.  He maintains insanity quite well, and while his voice will never match that perfect Joker provided by Mark Hamill over the years, it's a pretty good imitation.  The Joker is a frequent player, which is a plus because he's one of the stronger characters in the show so far.

There is no commissioner Gordon, instead there's a young Black detective and his sassy anti-Batman babe of a partner.  While these might be the results of a diversity meeting, they still provide pretty good banter, and Ethan helps Bruce Wayne develop a better sense of identity.

The last two episodes contain a joker story and the creation of Clayface.  Clayface's origin in the original Batman: TAS is one of my favorite stories, so naturally I was apprehensive going into these episodes.  I was pleasantly shocked.  The second-to-last episode does a good job of building up a lot for the season finale, and they absolutely deliver.  It's one of the more satisfying episodes of a Batman show I've seen, from Batman: TAS, to Batman Beyond, to this season of The Batman.  I won't talk much about it aside from my broad compliments, for fear of taking away from it.  Suffice to say a very new clayface is hatched in an episode that makes every single character seem real.  If this had been 13 episodes of this quality my review would be 5 stars and consist entirely of the words ""buy"" and ""watch.""

Despite the plodding feeling that was ever-present as I pushed through the bulk of the season, the improvements that came about at the very end will see me picking up the next box.",1198713600,3,2475,4.654377880184332
2248415,4,B0007XG266,"Updated 2/23/09  Okay, so now that Tyger, Tyger is my favorite Batman episode ever, what do I say?  I'll just say that this series stands on its own and is still very enjoyable to me.

After rewatching the first season of the Batman over the weekend, I realized something--this is a cartoon that gets so much right, in spite of the fact that it must contest with BTAS for its right to even exist.

The new Batman series makes great use of its voice talent, not to mention its animators.  I don't care what the dissenters say about Joker.  Matsuda's conception rules.  In fact, all of the character designs are, to me, quite fascinating and compelling.

Upon rewatching the first season, I noticed, too, how often Detectives Yin and Bennett were involved in each episode and found their character development to be top-notch.  Each episode paces itself extremely well, and I appreciate the humor involved, especially between Bruce and Alfred.  Rino does an awesome job of making Batman gritty.  What can I say?  I like Rino's voicework.

You do owe it to yourself to watch this on a high-definition tv with an upscaling (or better) DVD player.  The colors are simply gorgeous.

The only negative I have would be that there are only 13 episodes.",1194912000,3,1243,4.716279069767442

Plus you have U2 The Edge playing the theme song which is excellent. I haven't been following the comic book series so don't know if that's the reason behind some of the ill ratings but take it for what it's worth, a good story line, held my interest, good animation.",1192233600,2,540,4.252427184466019

2248419,3,B0007XG266,"Well after having just finished this Season 1 double disc set, I have to admit that while many of the criticisms have been a bit harsh, there is some truth to them as well.

I know comparisons to the generally impeccable Batman: The Animated Series (TAS) have been done to death, even this show's creators admit to their own fondness and inspiration from TAS when developing The Batman.

Honestly, the animation quality of The Batman is better than I remembered from catching occasional episodes on Saturday mornings.  The artistic style aims for a bit of Japanese-anime with odd (but interesting) color use.  Need examples? Prepare for a fair share of green skies, crimson skies, black and white interiors etc. Fans of TAS will likely need a moment to adjust to the brighter backgrounds and more close-up angle fight scenes but it is nothing that an episode or two doesn't take care of.

The stories are pretty well told especially considering that the intended age group of this series is far lower than the more-adult oriented TAS.  The problem is that the villains aren't near as well developed as they could (or should) have been.

We meet the Joker with little to no explanation of his coming to be and even less regard to his new look: Green dread locks, glowing red eyes, and an apparent dislike for shoes.

Things bottom out with Mister Freeze, who's back story is completely downgraded to a common diamond thief who has a car accident as a result of Batman's pursuit.  Fair enough until you witness TAS' take on the same villain in which your heart actually goes out to the man as he's misunderstood by everyone (except Batman).

On the other hand The Ventriloquist was done with a surprising deal of class and accuracy as is Firefly, proving that there is hope for this series if the writers wish to dig a little deeper.  I suppose the biggest consolation comes in the form of the reviews I've read on the Second Season where reviewers state a turn for the better regarding the issues I've just highlighted here.

I ordered all three complete seasons and will be digging into the second one tonight.  I will post my thoughts when I complete it.",1177286400,3,2155,4.684350132625995
2248420,4,B0007XG266,"Short Summary: This whole cartoon of the Batman saga begins at Bruce Wayne's anniversary of being Batman for three years now. It seems at this time, the 'true' villains show their faces, such as appearances by Joker, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and even the sassy Catwoman. This show also introduces police detectives: Ellen Yin and Ethan Bennet -- Bruce's best friend!

My Opinion: I have to admit, I do like the first season, but I love the second season better. This season is more along the lines of introducing the villains and what they may do for the show (or so to speak). The stories may not be as great as Batman: The Animated Series, and such others, but this show isn't as bad as people say it to be. I think the animation in this is stunning!, but I guess it makes up for some of the lame story lines in SOME of the episodes. It also gets on my nerves when the police seem to never use their 'Star Wars blasters' to get the criminals. It's understandable I guess when you think about it; this show IS more diverted towards children around 10 years or so.

My Opinion of Great Episodes: I'm a big fan of this new animated Joker, and I basically watch his episodes over and over again (yeah, I know: pathetic). That dosen't mean there aren't still great episodes, such as the list that follows:

1. ""The Bat in the Belfry"" (the pilot episode, and also introduces the monkey-movements of Joker...at least for this episode)

2. ""Traction"" (pratically the only episode you see Bane in. Batman must find more strength if he ever wants to defeat this foe!)

3. ""Big Dummy"" (Batman is perplexed when he meets ventriloquist Arnold Wesker...along with his demanding dummy, Scarface)

4. ""Topsy Turvy"" (is there two Joker's running around, or is this all some kind of prank?)

5. ""Bird of Prey"" (jealousy of Bruce Wayne takes its toll on Penguin when he decides to rob the guy...while the media watch Bruce's every step!)

6. ""The Rubber Face of Comedy"" (Joker has a new 'chemical' up his sleeve, and decides to kidnap a certain officer and use it on him!)

7. ""The Clay Face of Tragedy"" (when Ethan becomes Clay Face, he takes his rage on the gruffly police cheif!)

Overall: This show may not be for everyone, but you Batman fans shouldn't judge it unless you've actually watched it. I too, was skeptical at first on watching this show, but it's not as bad as some people say it is. I mean, some stories could use a redo-over, but overall: it's not a bad show; for children or adults alike.",1174003200,5,2487,4.518930957683741

2248422,2,B0007XG266,"I was a fan of the campy ""Batman"" of the 60's. I loved Bruce Timm's vision in ""Batman: The Animated Series""; although the original episodes borrowed their look heavily from Tim Burton's movie, the characters were well-developed (consider the time spent introducing Two-Face or Mr. Freeze), and the series evolved over time to create an excellent atmosphere with great story-telling.

Unfortunately, none of this is present in ""The Batman"". This series is mediocre in many regards - Bruce Wayne comes across as a weak, forgettable character, and the villains are nothing to write home about (although I did like the fact that they re-designed many of them, they just don't seem to work in any regard). The dialogue is inane as well.

Not a strong offering...",1171756800,3,757,5.0

It definitely looks as if it's made for kids, but my kids (aged 7 and 10) are not taken in by this charade.  They know what the Joker is supposed to look like and how he is supposed to act and sound.  This thing is an abomination.",1168300800,9,394,4.0
2248424,4,B0007XG266,"Characters like Batman and Superman cast long shadows. The aura of these characters is that they have no reality to bind them to. They are borne of our imagination and own psyche and that is why they can be resurrected in the image of different eras in time. They are symbols of our own internal selves, that is why you can draw them up again and again and they never die. Superman represents that part of the human psyche that is beyond destruction and rises uncorrupted no matter what you throw at it, no matter what you do to it. Batman is the exact opposite. Batman is a mortal, tormented soul on the edge that lurks in the shadows, and takes on evil with a dark vengeance. Superman is the real person and Clark Kent is the mask, but Bruce Wayne is the real person and The Batman is the mask. In a sordid sort of way, Superman is like Dr. Jekyll and Batman is Mr. Hyde - two sides of the same coin.

And once again, Batman has been resurrected in this retro series. ""The Batman"" is constructed in a time before the one depicted in the classical ""Batman: The Animated Series"", probably a decade or so earlier. Bruce Wayne is in his mid-20's and Batman is not yet the legend depicted in The Animated Series. He has just appeared on the scene of Gotham and started his shadowy crime-fighting career where the law sees him no differently than the characters he is at odds with.

Some of the characterizations are good and you can feel how they gel in given the above backdrop. Sobriety and age doesn't seem to have caught up with an also-younger Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's confidant and surrogate-guardian. He is presented as being slightly perkier and more wisecracking compared to the depiction in The Animated Series.

Batman is defined by the villains he faces and in season one, his old nemeses The Joker, Penguin, Bane, Dr. Langstrom, Mr. Freeze, Firefly, Scarface, and Clayface are all back. The Joker lives up to his maniacal aura and Kevin Michael Richardson's voice doesn't deviate far from the signature personality that Mark Hamill gave Joker in TAS; KMR's voice has more timber and gruffness at times compared to the diabolical cackle of Mark Hamill. I thought the look of the Joker was a bit too ""jack in the box"" making him look grotesque at first glance. Oswald Cobblepot a.k.a. the Penguin is cast more in the image of Tim Burton's rendition from the movie. Again, Tom Kenny does a good job giving more deviousness to Penguin's character. Bane, Dr. Langstrom a.k.a. The Man-Bat, and Scarface don't deviate much either apart from their color schemes compared to TAS. Firefly looks better. I liked the Firefly character line better in the TAS but this series has done a decent makeup job on him especially with the buzzing audio f/x.

Mr. Freeze is a heresy. The whole Mr. Freeze character in TAS was a masterpiece between his personality as defined by his accident and his quest to save his wife, and Michael Ansara's ""poker-faced"", emotionless, superb voice characterization completing things full circle. This series has turned Victor Fries into a common thug in a walking icebox for a suit.

However, the delight of season one, as everyone has commented below is the whole Clayface arc. This series has done for Clayface what TAS did for the Harvey Dent/Two-Face and Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze story arcs, and the story and production teams get kudos for the way they draw out the entire Clayface story arc in the fantastic two-episode season finale.

As for the presentation, The Batman is slightly more colorful and more detailed than TAS. Part of the power of TAS was that it was drawn entirely on black and created its ambiance by capitalizing masterfully on abstraction and lack of details in animation, while sticking with a more restrictive color palette comprised of dark, crimson, shadowy colors. This series has more details in the artwork and a wider use of colors. It takes a few episodes to get used to it if you are a die-hard TAS fan. The TAS also mixed in some retro elements such as the cars and buildings at times very aesthetically. The batmobile looks more commercial in this series, more high-tech, but more like Bruce Wayne decided to have Toyota, Honda or Audi build it for him. :-) Arkham Asylum looks better in this series in my opinion; the addition of detail such as the brickwork walls and pipe-grill doors, have done it good. It looks more creepy than cozy and you can see it as this really creepy holding place for mentally insane criminals. It augments the dark aura of the Batman character itself.

Finally the voice characterization of Rino Romano fits given the background. Kevin Conroy's voice was perfect for a mid-30s Batman, who had been ""at it"" for a decade or more -- an established legend in Gotham, more sure of himself, used to facing whackjobs and weirdos. Kevin Conroy gave Batman ""the coming of age"" personality. Rino Romano gives personality to a younger Batman, more unsure of himself, just out of adolesence and still coming to grips with what he is becoming. Rino Romano's voice characterization lacks the command and force of Kevin Conroy...which is correct.

All in all, it's a new Batman for a new era and if you like the Batman character, don't miss it.",1164240000,12,5229,4.707103825136612

2248428,5,B0007XG266,"First off, the Batman animated series man in the 1990's was top notch and amazing. This new show may not live up to those very high standards, however, that doesn't mean that this new animated series is crap. First off, Alan Burnett, someone who was part of the team that made the Batman: TAS version in the 1990's, made this show. The show is in my opinion, top notch. AMAZING and beautiful animation, the characters all look awesome. I love the drawings. The plots that are each script aren't as weak as everyone says they are. This show almost beats every animated cartoon made on air currently.

The fights are the biggest improvement. Batman actually fights the way he was meant to fight, he display a great variety of techniques. I love the new fight scenes!!  He's much more agile and the choreography of the fights are incredible, almost anime like.  I mean, why shouldn't they be?  It's Batman!!  All those years of training, he better be able to do this. I love the new acrobatic skills Batman displays in this show!!

The Clayface story, like the two face story (which Alan Burnett also wrote) is pretty deep. I like it, a lot. Yes, it's not two face, so what? It's a NEW Batman people. In case you're wondering, the 90's version of Batman changed many concepts of Batman from the comics, MANY CONCEPTS!! This show is also doing the same thing. Some aren't that great (I didn't like the change in Mr. Freeze and Bane) and some are much better (Spellbinder is just a WICKED villain, Clayface is really cool, The Riddler is much more clever in this version).

Overall, people are being a bit too critical. It's not a perfect show and it will get better. We still have yet to see Rhaas Al Guul, which I'm sure is bound to be a treat. I like this show, it's great. It's not the 1990's version, or Justice League, but it's enjoyable.",1154304000,3,1839,4.504504504504505

2248430,2,B0007XG266,"The Batman... oh boy, where to begin. I'm a longtime Bat-fan, seen all the movies, all the shows, including the 60's ones (*shudder*), and read a number of graphic novels/comics. For any hardcore Bat-fan, yea, you're probably gonna want to buy this. My advice? Don't buy it until its the very last Batman media on the planet. It's way to ""modernized,"" and by modernized I mean dumbed-down and treated as an easy way to make money off the new and upcoming Batman films. If you like the Teen Titans (which I feel is much worse than this), you'll probably like this more. But if you like Batman: The Animated Series (IMO, the best animated show of all time), then you'll probably not enjoy these.

The Penguin does kung-fu, the Joker is a Jamaican clown monkey thing. Mr. Freeze, who had finally worked his way into a decent villain with TAS, has degenerated farther than he was in the 60's show. TAS turned Mr. Freeze from one of Batman's least known, and least well liked villains, to popular and loved enough to make it into a feature film (albeit a horrible one) only a year or two after TAS's version. The Riddler sticks pretty much where he was thankfully, though I don't particularly care for his new look, he is still fairly well done. Firefly is a worse villain than ever, which doesn't take much, since he's probably the worst Batman villain out there. Bane is a little dumbed down, but beefed way up, in the typical trend these days anyway, overall not too bad. Clayface may be the only villain I like more, though it is had to decide, I think the only thing holding him back for me is the art style of the show. His character is more well motivated than most the previous Clayfaces of the comics/cartoons, though I think they could have pushed it a lot farther. Killer Croc is back, not as funny and lovable as he was in TAS (""I threw a rock at him!.... It was a big rock..."" anyone?), but I like this version as well.

Overall, I couldn't recommend this to anyone. It'll probably appeal most to the kind of people who just had to have Batman and Robin on DVD, even though they know its terrible, just to complete their collection. The art style and the terrible treatment to many of the greatest villains in comic history are probably my biggest gripes. If you don't mind the art and you're new to Batman villains (what are the chances of *that*!?!) then you may think you're money is well spent here, I can't speak for those people though.

I thought it was okay, the animation was fine, story/plot, kind of predictable but still entertaining.  Being the first season it had to do a lot of expolsition and all that, but I liked it.  Then I heard about Batman: The Animated Series and bought it, although I still continue to watch The Batman.  I really liked the show, and it's good.

Regarding The Batman, although the stories are average and the Joker does look weird, it's still alright.  Yes Batman: The Animated Series is a better show, this one is not without it's good episodes, The Rubber Face of Comedy and The Clayface of Tragedy are top notch.  I heard there's a line from ""The Killing Joke"" in there.  Those two episodes were great and what got me interested in Batman.  The show's not perfect but it's not horrific when you get used to the animation style.

I acutally bought this and my opionon has changed regarding this show.  It's a lot better than I remember and I like more of the episodes now that I've rewatched them.  This is worth buying.  But buy this one too.

2248433,5,B0007XG266,"Initially, I thought as many of my fellow reviewer's do, that this cartoon does not do Batman justice, that to many changes have been made to the character, villains, and the voices were wrong. This is not the Batman from the 1990's animated series or even the Batman on the Justice League cartoons, this is very different, and so it must be wrong. However, my children love it. This Batman is geared for a younger audience, an audience that has not read the comics for years, an audience that that did not grow up listening to the incredible voice talents of Kevin Conroy, an audience that knows little to nothing about Batman.

This cartoon is reintroducing the Batman to a new younger generation, and the kids love it. This first season introduces Batman to Gotham, and shows his struggles and successes. Many of the critics complain that this is a Gotham with out Gordon, and there is a new take on many of the villains. Once again, the fundamentalist in me was initially outraged, but seeing the way my children responded to the show made me think outside of my traditional Bat-Box and look at the show with new eyes. And I was able to enjoy the cartoon for want it was, a cartoon and a new take on the legend of Batman.

If you are able to forget many of the details of the modern era Batman(as many people have had to do from time to time in Batman's sixty-plus year career) and step out of your traditional Bat-Box and look at the show with new eyes you will enjoy it and your kids will love it.

The reason I gave it five stars is two fold. First it's Batman. The second is that this cartoon gives a hero to a new generation. Kids learn from what they watch, they will try to emulate their favorite cartoon characters. Batman is a hero, a man of principal, who fights for what is right, and a great role model for children; as opposed to Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd, and Edie, Sponge Bob, Brats, and Grim and Evil to name a just a few. We live in a time where many professional athletes are not good role models, we are in a controversial war, terrorist attacks make the news regularly, and government officials are corrupt. Giving kids a hero like Batman gives them an ideal to believe in, and a positive role model to strive to be like. So what if the cartoon is not as good as the one we grew up with, or the director took liberties with the city and the rogues' gallery, the director reintroduces a hero to a new generation.",1146873600,5,2431,4.362030905077263
2248434,4,B0007XG266,"While I may not be the most die-hard of Batman fans -- although I certainly do have very fond memories of Batman: The Animated Series -- I have to say that I think this show, for what it is, kicks @$$. This may not be the Batman we grew up with, it is a Batman mythology that largely works within its own conceptual framework. Mind you, there are few life lessons to be gleaned here and the moralistic leanings are occasionally suspect, but overly-simplified good versus overly-slimplified does get its due. And that never gets old, right? Anyhow...

Many of the villians we originally grew to love as shaded multifaceted characters get short shrift in The Batman, but the Bruce/Alfred relationship has some nice depth to it. Moreover, the re-working of the villians - while more successful in some cases than others - is a pleasant excuse to showcase some of the very best action sequences we have seen in this incarnation of Batman or any other. So, while I share some of the other reviewers mixed feelings over this latest incarnation, I also can't help but feel like this is an okay way to blow twenty minutes and thirty seconds.

I think the re-designed Batman looks cool and the updated villians are also interesting.  The stories are entertaining and I like that Alfred is more involved in the plots also.

The Caped Crusader is back again in an all new way.  The staple villians have been altered for and for worse.  The change is nice though.  Alfred is the best in this series.  Joker is a big change, Penguin rocks, Bane is hot, Freeze is ok (not really cool) Catwoman is meoooooow, and Clayface is one of my new favorites.

The DVD's themselves are good, but not great.  I had some problems with lagging at one point between sound and picture and had to restart an episode due to skipping.

My biggest gripe is the lack of chapters.  Why can't they spend the extra 10 seconds of programming time and at least add some chapters to the episodes?

2248446,4,B0007XG266,"Have you ever wanted to see the beginnings of a character?

This new version of Batman year one is good animation . It  is  better than most of  recent cartoons  that is out there...especially the  Teen Titans, which rips off  Japanimation styles and does not  work for me as a serious superhero cartoon (yes I know many will not like that statement!)

And . Yes, I am a fan of Batman the Animated series.  It broke new ground in animation and the Batman mythos.  its better that the 1960 cartoon  Filmation did (By the way, this stuff  has never hit DVD yet) and the 80's cartoon series with Robin (which was run with Lone Ranger, Tarzan or Zorro on CBS ).  This animated  show acts like neither B.A.S. ,  the 1960's Batman or even the early 80's cartoon  remake and I am so glad it isn't . This  is a young Bruce Wayne learning to be Batman, not the well seasoned Bats from the BAS . This is a  cartoon version of the film Batman Begins, it  works in some ways and fails in others. This Batman may have the cave, the tools and the toys-but he is very green and still learning how to put it all together

I like the story lines, Most of them  are fresh,innovated,  well thought out and  well acted. The modern day non art demo of this cartoon works as well. The voice talent for this Batman is first rate, better than the formally  mentioned Teen Titans and less HOLLYWOOD as BAS was. Now the BAD news,  the animation of most of  the Batman's arch-villains seem off in my opinion... too weird and strange from the classic Batman Mythos-the Comics of old.  Such  Characters  like Joker, Penguin, and Clayface to name three does not seem right to me. Also, some of  the villain's origins are changed... some for better and some for the worst. However, Thank you there is NO Robin-one of the weakest points in BAS .This  Dark Knight seems to be a throw back the the 1930's classic comic version-judged and hunted as a fugitive by the police... Thought of  as a criminal in the Police's eyes, as well

On the Whole, this new animated Batman is good  value for the money and worth your time. if you like old  Batman..REMEMBER  this is NOT your father's Batman

2248447,2,B0007XG266,"With Warner Bros. working overtime to revive everything Batman, a new animated series was on the horizon, and no one by the name of Paul Dini or Bruce Timm would be involved in it.  The Batman is aimed at younger viewers and portrays a green and young Bruce Wayne in his early years of being the Dark Knight.  However, the show doesn't work right, and the characters are flat, particularly the villains.  One of Batman's greatest strengths is his rouges gallery, and in this series, they are relegated to run of the mill crooks.  The Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and the Man-Bat become two dimensional thugs that are shells of their former selves, while Batman himself has become an adrenaline junkie.  The animation style is stiff and more manga-esque than one could imagine, and it's a look that doesn't work.  What saves season one of the Batman is the finale, which creates an unbelievaly tragic turn on the origin of Clayface, which suggests that maybe there is some hope for the show.  All in all, if you're a long time Bat-fan, stick with the classic Batman: the Animated Series, and check this out only for the finale.  If you're a parent however, this is worth checking out if you have children who are too young for the phenominal aforementioned animated series.",1140048000,6,1281,4.713004484304933
2248448,4,B0007XG266,"While I love ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and consider it an all time classic, I think ""The Batman"" is great.  I am an avid comic book reader, well I was before the two bundles of joy came along, and consider a change of artists and writers to be a positive thing.  The same style of drawing or writing, no matter how good, becomes stale after a while.  There are a few character renditions that I don't care for, namely Joker and the Riddler, but Catwoman and Penguin are very good.  I did get burned buying the first two volumes of the season only to find that all 13 episodes were contained on these two dvds but I chalk that up to poor research on my part.  All in all, I don't consider this on par with some of the better seasons of ""Batman: The Animated Series"", but I do enjoy it very much.  It has a very modern feel to it and the gadgets and technology The Batman has access to in this series, far exceeds that of any of the others.  I also enjoy that he is younger and more involved with the Wayne companies.  It adds a dimension to the story not shown in ""Batman: The Animated Series.""  Well worth the money and highly recommended for fans of Batman.",1139702400,4,1162,4.221719457013575
2248449,5,B0007XG266,"First off, I'd like to say that I agree with both Michael S. Smith's review and M. Koby's review.

Watching this series for the first time, sans one episode I saw a couple weeks ago, on DVD, I can honestly say that this show is actually pretty damn good.

As those reviewers said, if you compare this to the '92-'95, series TAS and '97's Gotham Knights, then you might be disappointed.  But if you don't, and view this show with an open mind, it's a good take on the Batman character and Bruce Wayne.  Like M. Koby said, this show focuses on the struggles of Bruce Wayne trying to stike a balance between being Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Thankfully, this time, Bruce Wayne prefers to be Batman, as he cotinues to fight to rid Gotham City of the criminal element and to continue the legacy of his parents.

But enough of that...let's talk about the technical issues of this show.  First off, the animation, once you get used to it, is absolutely brilliant.  Yes, it's not TAS stuff, but that's a good thing in this case.  The animators use a blend of traditional cell animation and CG enhancementss, both in lighting effects and 3D modeling.  IMO, it ranks right up there with the 2003 MTV Spider-Man series.

Now then, the reimagined character designs, specifically the rogues gallery.  Some have said that they don't like some of the liberties the creators have taken with the origins of some of the villians.  I can understand that.  The new origin of Clayface is totally different than his original comic book origin.  But that's fine.  As M. Koby said, if you just throw out all comic book continuity and look at this series as its own new Batman world, then you can grow to like it.

Currently this show is in its 3rd season and I hope that they'll do enough seasons to get in that 60-80 episode count like they did with TAS.  After watching this first season, I am really looking forward to the second season release in September.

I'll leave you with this thought.  Even though this show is billed as a Saturday morning kid's show (DC Kid's Collection), I'm 32 and I enjoyed this series a bit more than TAS.  However, I liked Gotham Knights (Vol. 4) pretty well too.  I'm hoping I'll like Batman Beyond too.  Haven't seen any of that show either.",1139529600,5,2251,4.517326732673268
2248450,3,B0007XG266,"""The Batman"" does have issues. Weak, poorly developed characters, a more modern style that sometimes causes the characters faces to bend into unusual and un-natural shapes as they move from frontal to profiled views.

On the whole though the show does produce some impressive visuals.

My major complaint is that each episode is barely 20 minutes long, counting the opening and closing sequences. This probably says more about the state of modern 1/2 hour television than it does the show, but it does answer a lot of the complaints.

It's hard to have character development, plot and story in only 20 minutes.",1139443200,7,610,4.96078431372549
2248451,4,B0007XG266,"This series has gotten a lot of slack from the crowd that worships the original animation series.  Lets be straight.  Nothing will ever compare to that, or perhaps live up to it, so any Batman reincarnation will always fall under this, sometimes negative light.

This is, indeed, a good series, with animation that obliterates the original batman series.  Though the writing is not as good at times, the action and animation quality is consistent and energized, much more then the Bruce Timm series (ahh, see, another comparison).  And that's what I love most about it.  It looks fantastic.  I am a storyboard artist, and there are great uses of camera, light, shadow and composition in this series that are simply fantastic.

Add it to your collection.  It is just fun to watch.  No, it isn't the ""original"" series from the 90's, but common, how in the world do you follow that up?  No matter who draws it or writes it, it will always fall under the shadow of the original series. I give credit to these guys who took on an enormous task, to revive the legend.

First off throw out all the past 50-70 yeas of continuity from the comics, this isn't that kind of Batman.  This show is not mean to be a copy of comic continuity nor is it meant to be ""Batman: The Animated Series"", but rather this version of Batman is the kind that's meant for Saturday morning cartoons.  It's not suppose to be as dark as B:TAS.  And it focuses on something that A LOT of people forget when talking about Batman, that being that Batman is the story of Bruce Wayne and his promise to his parents for justice.  If you focus on Batman and not Bruce Wayne you miss half of the story.  ""The Batman"" focuses enough on Bruce Wayne that you remember that it's his story but you see Batman enough to remember what you're watching.  ""B:TAS"" did a decent job on the Bruce Wayne front in the first couple of volumes but you could tell that the story became more about Batman and Bruce Wayne became secondary.

So if you're looking for a different type of Batman look no furhter.  If you want more ""B:TAS"" wait until Justice Leage Unlimted comes out in the season format.",1139184000,4,1315,4.244979919678715

It's not so much the new take on Dark Knight and his colorful rogues gallery but it's just bad the job they did. Batman : the animated series set the bar. These folks decided to go below the bar and start digging a hole about six feet deep.

2248456,2,B0007XG266,"Let's start with what I do like.  The style of the cartoon is actually pretty good.  At first I was a little turned off by the whole ""X-treme"" Batman, but considering this is Bruce Wayne in his younger days I think it works.

However, the characters are reduced to nothing.  Batman has absolutely no edge to him.  In the original series we got to know his past and saw him really struggle with the death of his parents, and lets be honest, the best thing about Batman is that he's the first superhero who's given a real motive.  In this series the death of his parents are brough up a few times, but as a driving force it's generally ignored.

The villians are all one-note characters.  In the original series each villian had some kind of conflict.  It wasn't just good versus evil; it was about that in-between grey.  The Man-Bat is just some mad scientist.  Mr. Freeze is just some jewel thief.  They're run of the mill pedestrian characters.  The only exception is Clay Face.  Lets hope this new version of Clay Face is pointing to a new direction to the series.  Maybe the writers will wise up and give us some good stories.  Until then I'll be watching the DVDs of the original Batman: The Animated Series.",1138665600,51,1212,4.465753424657534
2248457,1,B0007XG266,"In every incarnation of Batman since the first movie, Batman has always been a silent stalker of the night hunting down criminals and bringing them to justice. While the 'bringing them to justice' part might not change in this series, everything else does.

Batman is no longer the dark hero he used to be. He's turned into a  young, cocky, 'style over substance' character which can only have been made up in the minds of the corporate focus groups who created this fluff. While older incarnations of batman (such as his excellent portrayal in the Animated series which ran from '92 to '99) had Batman as a character that could be enjoyed by adults and kids, this show portrays him in a way that would get a him killed in any other Gotham city.

Bruce Wayne's ""reimagining"" is that of a shallow guy who doesn't seem realistic at all if you post him into the world of Gotham City that all the older Batman's lived in. But Bruce Wayne as a shallow guy whose poor acting doesn't support the show is only the half of it. One thing that made all the other Batman shows so great was the portrayal of the villains as interesting people. Not here.

Joker has turned into a big demon-faced guy with no personality (a huge difference from Mark Hamill's amazing portrayal of Joker in both The Batman Antimated Series and Batman Beyond) Mr. Freeze has no reason to be doing what he's doing anymore (he looks like a demon with an icecube on his head, which Batman makes fun of with some horrible puns). And Penguin...well basically EVERY villan in the series looks like a demon. Not surprising, because this show was designed by the people who did the Jackie Chan Adventures (a show about demons). But Batman isn't about demons, it's supposed to be about the humanity of the characters. The depth, and not just the style.

This show falls through in story, acting, and is barely held together by the style. Old Batman fans will be horrified, comic book fans will be disgusted, and new fans will have their image of Batman forever tarnished. It's very obvious that this show was made for money to cash in on the new movie of Batman, and not because of any love for the characters.

Certainly, Season One has its rough spots.  But so did Season One of B:TAS.  And there's a lot to like here if you don't mind a little creative license with the characters.  Personally, I find this version of the Joker very appealing (much more obviously deranged) and the reinterpretation of Clayface and the Man Bat are very cool.

Is it as good as B:TAS?  I'd have to say no.  But it all depends on what you're looking for, and how seriously you take a character who is basically a rich guy running around in a bat suit fighting crime.  If you want it to be tragic, melodramatic, and deep then stick with B:TAS.  If you want some cool action with some interesting characters then try this out.

A fan of superheroes since childhood I can enjoy them in practically any format- and while The Batman is certainly not Batman: The Animated Series it can be just as certainly said that it was never intended to be.  I don't remember anyone whining 10 years ago that B:TAS was not like Super Friends.  That's the strength - and part of the charm - of a character that has been in continuous publication since 1939; how he can survive and thrive in various media and somehow STILL remain fresh, interesting, and relevant after decades and decades of stories (be they live action, cartoon, comic books, novels, video games, and feature films).  And there have been so many- Bob Kane's Batman is not Denny O'Neil's Batman is not Adam West's Batman is not Michael Keaton's Batman is not Dick Giordano's Batman is not Frank Miller's Batman and on and on and on...  Sure I have versions I prefer (we all do) but I can find points of interest in them all.  Though I confess there are not many interesting points in my least favorite version, Batman & Robin (the IV feature film that nearly killed the film franchise), but even it can be appealing to young Batman fans.

Which brings me back to The Batman.  If you want to think there is only one Dark Knight (i.e. Kevin Conroy's) then this series is not for you.  Otherwise, it is an interesting take on the character.  The producers take the most license with their interpretation of the villains but on the whole they are not bad- especially Clayface.

But wait...are there any fans and collectors? The general bat-fan will tell you this show sucks, while the small but vocal die-hards will pump The Batman for all its worth. This is a very difficult show to rate. Not only does it feel like Batman as envisioned by corporate focus groups, but the general writing is way below par compared to the classic Batman: Animated series.

In my opinion, these problems are mostly confined to the first season. This is definitely the show at its worst, and the newer seasons have been much more kinetic and entertaining. It's painful here to watch Bruce eat nachos and cast opera aside for bubblegum pop. It's painful to watch him resort to an endless array of bat-gadgets to take down foes. But the show has occasional moments of brilliance. When Batman slips into a coma after being thrashed by Bane, there's a very poignant look at the night of his parents' murder. The villain designs, wacky and grotesque as they may be, are fiercely original and fun if you go in with the right expectations. And the season finale, written by Gargoyles creator Greg Weisman, brings the show to a near-BTAS level with a brand new interpretation of Clayface. It's really worth checking out.

Again, this is a difficult recommendation. Season 1 is mostly weak, and I can't blame anyone for shunning it. However, the second season onwards is definitely worth looking into. I at least give kudos to WB for giving us The Batman in a season set that has more appeal to adult collectors. For those on the fence, check out season 2 when/if it is eventually released, then go back and see if you'd like season 1 for completion purposes.

Immediately, I picked up my two seasons of the 90's Batman TAS serie and my four animated movies for him to watch. So I put him to watch the first season of Batman TAS. And guess what? He LOVED IT! He also told me he wanted a copy! He told me as we was watching ""Uncle, I like this cartoons more than the ones on TV"".

Do yourself a favor: avoid like the plague this DVD and buy a Scooby Doo cartoon for your kid, instead of this. He will thank you.

Avoid this show, as this is not even Batman, is a moron wearing a cape and a cawl that calls himself Batman. This should be burned and left alone for good. Save your money and buy the complete first season of Batman TAS yet.",1134950400,9,1003,3.9554455445544554
2248468,4,B0007XG266,"Many decry this new Batman as pailing in comparison to earlier animated versions of the character, however, I completely disagree.  I think the character redesign (more of a neo-retro look for the character) is smart and intelligent, the animation (although influenced heavily by the more manga style of today's animated television shows) works wonderfully and is fast paced enough for today's ""seen it all"" audiences to keep the viewer interested, and the villian redesigns are some of the best I've seen for the Batman mythos.

Being a huge Batman fan, regardless of the media in which the character appears (i.e.- comic books, movies, animation, action figures, etc.), I consider myself someone who is very hard to please.  I was thoroughly impressed by the Batman Animated series of the late 90's and loved even more the New Adventures of Batman animated series that followed several years later.  In other words, I've been following the animated incarnations of this character for quite some time.  That being said, in my humble opinion, this new The Batman animated series is a more than worthy update to the previous incarnations and then some!  It's definitely a different interpretation, but it never loses it's connection to the true essence of the character, which is very important.  It's dark where it needs to be, humorous where appropriate, and constantly keeps me guessing as to how each new/old character will be interpreted.

I recommend purchasing this Season 1 disk very highly.  Hopefully you'll enjoy the show as much as I do!",1134432000,9,1548,5.086956521739131

The Batman has no such respect.  The writing is a disaster, the direction is uninspired and the vocal casting is an insult.  Rather than expand upon the dark, brooding mythos, the creators of this cartoon wiped the slate clean.  Bruce Wayne is a playboy millionaire who is alerted of crisis by the Bat... PDA.  Yup, a PDA.  They call it the Batwave, which makes less sense as it sounds like a jet ski with wings.  Joker resembles that ugly amalgam of colors sweater your Grandma gets you every year.  Clayface looks like someone threw up Silly Puddy.

I urge you, strongly... DO NOT BUY.  DO NOT RENT.  If you want to be tortured by Batman... try Batman & Robin.  Avoid this like the plague and perhaps it will be canceled.

In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two ""hipper"" more ""kid-friendly"" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment.",1129161600,5,875,5.041379310344827
2248471,3,B0007XG266,"I'm about as big a Batman fan as there is. I've always believed the best superheroes can appeal to every age. Batman as an icon does. But ""The Batman"" as a morning cartoon does not. Just by deciding to air this show this day in age is asking for inevatable comparisons to ""Batman: The Animated Series"". That show in its own did things to make it unique, so I will try to avoid compare and contrasts (Because BTAS pounds the new show into oblivion).

What doesn't work for this show is its deviation from the source material: It's too action oriented, with little emphasis on Batman's detective skills (odd, considering he is a trademark of 'Detective Comics'). I like the fast paced battles, and the different 'fighting styles' of the villains, but the fact that some of them even fight at all is ludacris. The art doesn't quite work for me- I half expect Jackie Chan to guess star every week!

Bruce Wayne: Younger and better looking. We get the playboy billionare great. But where's the business man? And he doesn't seem plagued by a tragic past at all.

The Batman: Looks cool, moves cooler. I love the Batmobile's trail effect! Don't love the batwave- can we say Adam West?

The Joker: Great menacing voice. His ability to be amazing at hand-to-hand combat is just stupid. The dreadlocks are...interesting.

The Penguin: Love the 60s TV show laugh. Best representation yet.  This is the only character that's different from BTAS and STILL works. His ability to be a super-fast fighting athlete is just stupid, though.

Catwoman: The 'mousey' look is 'borrowed' from Jim Lee's art design, and takes some getting used to. I like the whip doubling as a tail around her waist. Her fighting ability makes sense. She's always been a sexy character and they don't fumble there.

Alfred: I actually can't stand him here. I know they are trying to give him his due, but he keeps bugging Batman to stop being Batman. Why watch a show where the main character is prodded not to even exist? His fake accent is not as good as BTAS' fake accent. For a butler, he sure is out of line sometimes.

Clayface: The best story they've done. I wish they gave that attention to Mr. Freeze. (who was just a common crook in the comics, you guys). Dropping the wife act was a huge mistake. And as for Clayface, there have been many clayface personas so I don't mind this origin. I'm glad we're seeing more ethnicity in villains too.

The Riddler:......uh,...um....His riddles are excelent. I guess they tried to make him scarier. His abilities at hand to hand combat are stupid!

Man-Bat and Scarface are portrayed okay. I actually think Bane and Killer Croc are better than I've seen before. I'm intrigued to see what they will do with villains to come, especially my favorite who we've yet to see: Two-Face. I appreciate attention given to other Batman rogues such as Firefly and Cluemaster, and new faces like Det. Yin are always welcome. But the lack of familiar faces like Gordon, Lucius Fox, and Leslie Thompkins make Gotham feel a little lonely. There should be more pedestrians walking around to breath life into the city. I guess everyone hides inside. Say what you want about this old-school-meets-new-school interpretation of the Dark Knight, but this show definately knows what it's trying to be.",1119484800,6,3286,4.7373029772329245
2248472,5,B0007XG266,"Not as good as Batman the animated series. But still outstanding show.  This show has great storylines and great villains. I especially like how Batman/Bruce Wayne and Alfred are portrayed. Also the villains are much different to keep up with the times.

Joker- He is much more insane in this series and a lot less intelligent, unlike BTAS he is a much better fighter and does not always try to defeat Batman with a trap,mystery,or weapon of some sort. He is also much less hillarious and without his great sidekick Harley.  I like the BTAS Joker much more but this Joker is still a pretty darn good villain.

Penquin- he was and always will be a great villain and he may be at his best in this series.

Manbat- More disturbed, very evil, and actually likes being a human bat.  Manbat himself has not changed at all, but Dr. Lankstrom is the opposite of what he was in BTAS.

Mr. Freeze- This time he is a common thief who happened to crash into some kind of chemical that turned him into Mr. Freeze. More mysterious but no huge changes.

Catwoman- No major changes, a little change of costume, much better fighter, a lot more of a criminal than one time theif.

Killer Croc- A lot different look.  Actually looks like a human croc and also has southern accent with a lot more intelligence.

Riddler- A much different look with a much more more sinister approach.

I recommend this DVD for Batman fans who are willing to adjust to the times",1119139200,2,1440,4.496153846153846

I have not yet seen these DVDs so I cannot comment on the format but I have been watching this new animated series since day one and I must say I love it.  There are a few things I dislike - like the way the characters look - I would much rather see the Joker look & dress like the Joker and the Cat-Woman, Bane and others too!  But the stories and the charaterations and the animation are all great!  I prefer the dark Batman of the 80's & 90's but this more light-hearted version is a nice diversion from his darker half.  I do wish the 80's/90's version also had the Batman wanted by police at the beginning as well.  I hate that Gordon is not in the picture - he should be a Lt. around this time.  And Robin should show up too since this show is supposed to take place starting in the third year as Bruce as the Batman - in the comics Bruce adopted Dick his third year as the Batman.

Yes, some do, but that doesn't mean that you have to go out of your way to make sure that the stories are paper-thing, and that the characters all look like Pokemon rejects. Either the writers of the scripts are seriously talking down to the audience, something you should never do no matter who the audience is, or they're just idiots themselves. I suspect it's a mixture of both.

2248475,3,B0007XG266,"If you're going to have any chance of liking this show, you have to completely forget about ""Batman: The Animated Series."" BTAS was, is, and will remain one of TV's crowning achievements in animation.  This new series doesn't aspire to anything that lofty-it's kid-vid. Judge it that way.

I'm 40 years old with a 10-year-old superhero-loving daughter. We watch the show together. We understand this show is a new riff. It has something of an anime influence, and it works. The show looks awesome. The theme music, by The Edge of U2, is very cool. Let's look at the characters. (BTW-don't look for Comissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Robin, Bullock, Montoya-they're not here. At least, not yet)

Batman/Bruce Wayne: He's young, he's just starting, he makes mistakes, and he's still having fun.

Alfred: One of the best parts of this show. Really captures the complex fellow that Alfred is.

Villains on this disc:

Joker: A Joker who is Bruce's equal in hand-to-hand combat? Neither my daughter or I care for this take on Batman's biggest foe.

Bane: Interesting version. Tad over-the-top, but what the heck. The episode does highlight Bruce's brainpower over brawn. The introduction of Rupert Thorne is a nice touch.

Penguin. This one flat-out-works. You really get a feel for what makes Oswald Cobblepot tick. They take the high-society-wannabee aspect of Paul Williams from BTAS, and add a true sense of menace.

Other villains from later in the series:

Catwoman: Get the costume right. My daughter and I call her Mousewoman.

Mr. Freeze: Worst of all the reimaginings. They've taken the most incredible tragic character from BTAS (and the DC Universe in general) and reduced him to a common jewel thief. Pathetic.

Clayface: Awesome. The two-part origin special may be the best episode so far. The production team really found their feet on this one. A Gotham cop gone horribly wrong through no fault of his own. Hearkens back to BTAS's treatment of Victor Fries.

Riddler: Loved it. Looks cool, and so far seems to be Batman's intellectual equal.

Bottom line: Batman can survive any reworking. From the camp of the '60s TV show to Frank Miller's brooding Dark Knight, the icon remains. ""The Batman"" is a update for a new audience, no more, no less. If you're expecting the glories of BTAS, save your money, and buy the BTAS box sets instead. If you're looking for a little kid-friendly fun, give it a whirl. Although at only three episodes on the disc, you might want to wait. For a better value for kid-friendly superhero action, try the six-episode ""Static Shock: The New Kid.""",1117065600,37,2580,4.914746543778802

The dialog is also lacking for this show as well. Plus I don't buy the excuse that the reason that this show is dumbed down is because its for kids. The original batman cartoon had just as many toys and had just as many kids watching it and still managed to pull off excellent characterization, intelligent dialog and a great story. You actually felt for the characters. Plus, you don't need to have seen the original animated series or even be a fan to see that 1.)this show is plagued with horrible dialog. 2.) batman is mis-characterized  and 3.) that theres absolutely no depth to this series or any of the characters.

2248477,4,B0007XG266,"You can see that this attempt at Batman is really more of a tie in with the soon to be released ""Batman Begins.""  The Bruce Wayne character is even drawn a bit more like the actor portraying him in the new movie.  The animation style is similar to the animated series ""Men in Black"" and bears the same producer (and Asian animation group I suspect).  The classic Batman villains are there but have a very different look and spin to them than how they were portrayed in either the DC comics or Batman the Animated Series. Even the origins of the villains has changed, as evidenced by the fact that Clayface is a Joker-gas mutated cop-friend of Bruce Wayne, not the actor Matt Hagen, whose skin was changed by chemical laden cosmetics.  And, instead of the Bat signal, Bruce Wayne is notified of potential criminal activity requiring his 'bat-presence"" via the ""Bat Wave"" flashing on his custom Palm Pilot.

If you can get over these liberties taken with the original Batman comics (not too dissimilar to the way Superboy/Clark Kent is being ""re-imagined"" for the TV series ""Smallville), it is actually a very enjoyable series to watch, although I must admit I liked the portrayal of Catwoman/Selina Kyle much better in the first Batman animated series.  You can't entirely fault Warner Brother for trying to re-invent Batman since they consider it a potentially profitable franchise that needed a major makeover to give it new life for the big screen and the small screen.  That having been said, if you can get over the fact that it's not exactly Batman the way you remembered him in the comics, and  just sit back and watch it as a kid, it's actually a pretty decent animated series.",1116633600,3,1684,4.704081632653061

Differing in tone from the acclaimed ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""THE Batman"" has sleek, angular designs and brings all your favorite characters to the forefront. I used to watch this on Saturday mornings and some weekday afternoons and could never get enough. Which is why it pains me to say this series isn't good.

The animation is a joy to look at, but each episode is a standalone with a weak plot, with only a thin thread of plot joining episodes together. As with most shows, this changes as the series goes on, but not much. The plot isn't helped along by every last character being fluent in cheesy one-liners. It's no exaggeration to say one-liners make up at least 30% of the dialogue, and usually don't even make sense.

Each season does have a thin plot throughout, as I said.
Season 1 starts soon after Batman has started his vigilantism, and he's often at odds with the Gotham Police Department.
Season 2 chronicles the building of an uneasy alliance and slowly toppling a corrupt government.
Season 3 introduces Batgirl, and Batman's reluctant mentoring and alliance with her.
Season 4 brings in Robin, as he finds his way with Batman and Batgirl's help.
Season 5 may as well be a full-blown Justice League cartoon.

For kids, I can say from experience that it's loads of fun. But even as an adult who loves watching old favorites like Redwall and Bionicle, this show is unbearably badly written.
