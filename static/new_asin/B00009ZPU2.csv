1899298,5,B00009ZPU2,"If you have read Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" -- and *liked* it -- then you were probably thoroughly disgusted by Paul Verhoeven's live-action movie adaptation. Completely aside from the bad acting, bad script, bad direction, and incredibly excessive gore and violence (a Verhoeven trademark, apparently), the sad truth is that the movie had almost NOTHING in common with the book.

""Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles"" is a much better adaptation. It doesn't tell the same story as the book, any more than the atrocious live-action movie did; but it is a million times truer in SPIRIT to what Robert Heinlein wrote.",1196035200,,635,5.287128712871287
1899299,5,B00009ZPU2,The Best Anime I have seen. Wonder why they stopped making anymore series. I hope they make these more.,1172620800,,103,4.473684210526316
1899300,5,B00009ZPU2,"Roughnecks used the look and feel of the movie, plus a lot of the storylines of the book to retell the story of the Mobile Infantry fighting a war against an alien invasion.  But they also introduced some unique ideas of their own and this episode had one of the better ones.
One intriguing idea that the series introduced was that of an alien race that did not use technology at all, but ""bred"" or ""grew"" whatever it needed.  So their ships are biological, their artillery is biological, and they have various kinds of fighting bugs as well.  That was a clever idea.
But this episode introduced another clever idea as well--the idea of giant ""sleeper bugs"" that could sleep in space for perhaps thousands of years, looking like an asteroid, until one day waking up to head off to a new planet to invade.  I don't know if that is a unique idea of their own, or if the writers got it from science fiction literature, but it is clever.  The one downside is that they never really show this sleeper bug very well.
Something that I liked about this series that this campaign showed off well is that the story does not always progress in ways you would expect, but in some ways is more ""real.""  For instance, at one point the troopers manage to get the Zephyr off the ground only to crash it only a short time later.  I did not see that coming.
One downside is that the commentary tracks occasionally leave something to be desired.  The filmmakers often re-cover the same background and explanations that they have on previous discs and we don't need to hear all of that stuff again.",1085270400,,1578,4.473867595818815
1899301,5,B00009ZPU2,"Having read Starship Trooper when it was first released many years ago, I felt like a purist when it came to the movie and a viewer of the Chronicles.  But having purchased the first six dvd's and now this new one, I am hooked and convinced that this series is a winner big time.
I am a bit confused about the issue of the last two episodes.  I watched Homefront and of course I was totally irritated by the fact that the producers left our heros on earth with bugs doing there dirty best to wipe out the human race and nothing follows.
Are the missing episodes the undrawn conclusion to Homefront episode?  I would hate for the bugs to win in the end.  :(
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PURCHASE to anyone that loved the book and the movie.  Our heros get more time to rescue all our butts and it is a great story.",1078617600,2,807,4.214285714285714
1899302,5,B00009ZPU2,I totally agree with everyone that's reviewed so far. We need the missing 2 catchall clips and the last few episodes!! Why stop when your so close to finishing the mission?,1073520000,4,172,4.580645161290323
1899303,4,B00009ZPU2,"I'm glad to finally see all* of the completed episodes make it to DVD.  They produced some wonderful work, and getting this show into the hands of it's fans is a great accomplishment.  Hats off to Audu!  Thank you!
However, portions of the footage seems grainy, like it was over-compressed, especially shots inside the dropship.  I have heard this from others, but don't know if it was a bad batch, or that's the best they could do (...since this story arc was not originally meant to be released to DVD.  And then, only after fan pressure.).
Oh, and am I the only one who is bothered by the fact the ""M.I."" logo on the Special Features menu is upside-down?? ...on every arc DVD?  That aside, I would still recommend R:STC to every fan of Starship Troopers!  Collect them all!  I did!",1072483200,,784,4.51063829787234
1899304,5,B00009ZPU2,"After almost a year of waiting, we finally have episodes 21 through 25 of this 40 episode series, bringing the total number available on DVD to 35 ... maybe we'll see the other five episodes some day. <Sigh!>
This disk does not have quite as many features as the other disks in the series (multiple languages, for example), but they did go back to the studio and enhance the music and audio effects, and the full-length commentary track provides insights into the making of the series.
Even though the target audience was adolescents, I'm in my 50s, and have been anxiously awaiting this ""missing week"" to complete my collection. (I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available, as I did with the other disks in the series.) As different from the movie as the movie was from the book, it is still Very Entertaining, and I really enjoy watching the reactions of people who see it for the first time. :-)
As revealed on one of the other disks, the actors recorded the scripts of two additional episodes, but they were never animated ... budget constraints near the end led to the creation of two ""clip shows"" to deliver the promised 40 episodes (5 episodes a week for 8 weeks.) We now have 7 of what should be 8 DVDs, and if enough fans buy them, maybe the producers will complete the unfinshed episodes and include them on a final DVD.
Cast your vote for completing the collection by buying this disk ... and if you haven't purchased any of the others yet, get this one first, because it's a well constructed, self-contained story arc that stands OK by itself, even if it is out-of-context.",1062633600,34,1587,4.5524475524475525
1899305,5,B00009ZPU2,"This and the final episodes (those which never were presented to TV) are the missing pieces to the Roughnecks Chronicles.  I was surprised they made this one.  Happy too!  The down-sie is the lack of other languages or extra commentaries that the previous ones had.  I pray the lost episodes make it to DVD too.
BUY THIS!!!! :)",1061942400,,327,4.586206896551724
1899306,5,B00009ZPU2,"The World Wide Web and some dedicated websites (to include Amazon.com) can be instrumental in obtaining a large concensus that can sway a major producer of DVDs to complete a series.  Kudos to the above (and you ""Roughnecks"" know who you are)!
This story arc had become the lost episodes of the Starship Troopers Chronicles, and was previously referred to as the ""Ice Planet"" story arc.  This arc will fill-in most of the loose ends (Zander's plight is explained, new bugs are introduced, etc.) and takes place between The Tesca Campaign and The Klendathu Campaign.
So now we face the Frozen Drool Campaign of anticipation.",1055894400,54,623,4.923809523809524
7994694,5,B00009ZPU2,Animation ain't just for the kids anymore! Each adventure stand alone as a sci fi feature length action adventure of huge scope. The language is clean and only the bugs get killed. But this series can be viewed as a valid continuation of the film franchise. I have 'em all and am delighted with them.

7994700,3,B00009ZPU2,"That said, I do not regret being able to complete the series.  But at the time this part of the series was created, money was an issue - and it shows in the finished product big time.  Movement is incredibly choppy and backgrounds are not good at all.  I understand that this was at the infancy of CGI, but wow...it sometimes hurts just to watch.",1355356800,,346,4.292307692307692
7994701,4,B00009ZPU2,"As a fan of the book, the movie, and Henlein in general, I bought all the DVDs in this series.  The CG is a little crude, sometimes it looks like a very old computer or X Box game, but that said these DVDs are the only way I can see more of Johnny Rico and friends.  Lets hope that someday they make a big budget movie that is spot on with the book's origional story.  Until then we will make due with what we have.",1335830400,,415,3.8588235294117648
