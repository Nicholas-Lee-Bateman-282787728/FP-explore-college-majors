I agree with the previous review, this was one of Juan Soler's best acting.  I also hope that they release Angela soon.  Angelica rivera and Juan Soler were awesome in that telenovela!!",1204156800,2,328,4.909090909090909
3086925,5,B0012E2EWK,this is a great novela!! Yadhira Carrillo as both Cordelia and Carlota she is great as both of them and juan soler is a good leading man. The storyline is good as well. Two women who look exactly alike and are in love with the same man and one of the ladies tries to take the place of the women is peer genius. I hope they release juan soler's other novela angela. He waseal good in that too. But enjoy!!!,1203292800,11,405,4.075

3086948,1,B0012E2EWK,"DON'T BUY THIS!!!!! I finally was able to watch the whole thing, meaning the last DVD and the quality of the picture was horrible. It skipped I don't know how many scenes. I couldn't watch the ending, I had to watch the ending on Youtube.  I looked at the DVD and it was not scratched. So they must have done a really bad job at copying it. I was so disappointed!! And now I can't return it because I bought it months ago, it's so many hours of watching it, I couldn't watch it all at once!! So I finally was able to watch the last DVD when I noticed this. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS!!! A bunch of thieves!!! I would give it at minus 5 stars if I could. SO unhappy.",1407801600,,678,3.948905109489051

3086952,5,B0012E2EWK,"La Otra (The Other - 665 minutes) Best Ever! I got my DVD from Amazon as soon as I saw this one from the library. It is absolutely essential that you suspend disbelief as a doppleganger for one gal steps into the life (and marital bed!) of another.

Years ago, the gorgeous Bernarda (Jacqueline Andere) married a millionaire while pregnant with her first daughter Eugenia (Mercedes Molto), whom she passed off as his. Soon after, they had another girl, Carlota (Yadhira Carrillo). When the millionaire died, his will stipulated that his fortune would pass to his daughters upon their marriages.

Obviously Bernarda has devoted her life to making sure neither daughter ever marries. When Eugenia gets pregnant and is abandoned (by that millionaire's son, who is seeking revenge for losing his father to the fortune hunter), she runs away and dies in childbirth. Sweet (weepy) Carlota is told she has an exact double but dismisses the idea. She has met a medical student Alvaro (Juan Soler), with whom she falls passionately in love. When her sister dies, her mother makes the medical student think it is Carlota, so he leaves for Mexico City, heartbroken.

Her conniving doppleganger Cordelia (also played by Yadhira Carrillo), seduces him into a loveless marriage, which produces a much-adored daughter. Loaded with coincidences, well-meaning friends, relatives and priests, everything manages to keep them apart for 10 years: She thinking he abandoned her at the altar, he thinking she is long-dead. Both of the attractive leads are nice people to root for, the villains are truly hiss-worthy and the little girl is wonderfully directed. This actor is a FIND!",1367107200,,1660,5.095588235294118
3086953,5,B0012E2EWK,"I fell in love with this novela on TV, and was amazed Amazon carried the series.  I bought it right away, and I'm still watching it.  It's such a beautiful novela, and the actress (Yadhira Carillo) does an amazing job portraying two very distinctive women.  One thing I will have to add, and it's a big con:  my discs have skipped twice so far, and I miss a huge chunk of a scene! :(  The way they handled my DVD was poor.",1349481600,,422,4.097560975609756
3086954,3,B0012E2EWK,"La Otra is a wonderful story if truly ""incredible"" in terms of its plot. As always, I wish that the story line were not so disconnected. This one does a pretty good job of telling the story although it's clear that so much is missing. My problem is that I had to send the DVD back because of damaged areas. The second one that replaced it was even worse. I wonder if it has something to do with the two-sided format that is used for these discs. Very frustrating.",1312588800,,463,4.213483146067416
3086955,4,B0012E2EWK,"Good quality of image, the story is very good but unfortunately the DVDs only contain the main part of the story, every thing else has been cut off.",1304985600,,148,4.321428571428571
3086975,3,B0012E2EWK,"El Producto me llego Mal, los Discos Estan Rayados, el Dvd 2 se congela la imagen y se tranca en varias partes, es muy molesto. Y el Disco 3 del Lado 2 no se ve casi nada, sobre todo en el Comienzo y en el Final de la Telenovela. Al Limpiar los Discos con una Franela Nueva, Sin Uso, logre que se viera un poco mas, pero los Discos Estan Rayados.
En cuanto a el Resumen de la Telenovela Me Gusto, aunque podria haber sido muchisimo mejor.
El Final de Cordelia esta editado, no se ve cuando ella corta la luz de la casa y Adrian sale afuera a ver que pasa, llama a la Empleada (Simona) y ella le dice que seguramente alguno de los trabajadores bajo la llave sin querer, y eso lo entiendo, porque en el Final esa mujer tiene gran importancia, ya que es la que lleva el maletin que Bernarda le pidio a Adrian a cambio de la combinacion de la caja fuerte, escena que por supuesto no esta en el Dvd, por eso las quitaron.
Estoy Muy Molesto porque sacaron mucho del Final, podrian haber dejado un poco mas, un capitulo de mas de 40 Minutos lo Resumen en menos de 20 Minutos.
Faltan Muchas Escenas, sobre todo cuando Bernarda se le escapa a Adrian al sacar el dinero del banco y el la persigue en un taxi, la llama al celular y le dice que ya llamo a la Policia, que les dijo todo lo sabe de ella, que le conviene fugarse con el, luego los dos van a la terraza de un edificio, en el cual discuten por el dinero y Adrian se lo trata de arrebatar y se les cae el maletin. Despues pactan un arreglo, en el que Bernarda le promete dar la combinacion de la caja fuerte de la casa siempre y cuando el le deje el otro maletin en el lugar que acordaron. Lo que sucede despues si esta en el Resumen, lo unico que me molesto es que no tenga la escena final en la que se ve a Bernarda en otro pais, haciendo de las suyas, que evidentemente, se habia fugado con el dinero despues de matar a Adrian, escena clave e importante, ya que ese era su Final. Tambien falta la Escena en que Carlota habla con el hijo de su hermana Eugenia, que la verdad es preciosa, es una pena que la hayan quitado.
A mi en lo Personal se me hizo algo aburrida la Novela, en los Inicios tiene muy buenas escenas de Jacqueline Andere con Yadhira Carrillo, discuciones, dialogos, escenas fuertes pero el Lado 2 del Disco 1 y el Dvd 2 del Lado 1 se me hizo muy aburrido y molesto de ver ya que Carlota se la pasa llorando por Alvaro y su Hermana Eugenia. Es un fastidio ver todo el tiempo, una y otra vez a Carlota llorar con el Piano que Alvaro le regalo. Podrian al menos haber sacado alguna de esas escenas reiterativas que siempre muestran lo mismo, llanto y mas llanto.
En el Dvd 1, sobre el final falta algo importante en la Historia, la Muerte de Eugenia, la Hermana de Carlota. Se ve cuando Bernarda le da la noticia a Carlota, pero no cuando Eugenia Muere.
Por otra parte considero que quitaron muchas escenas importantes de Cordelia para dejar mas de Carlota y Alvaro, cosa que me parece muy mal, ya que en esas escenas Cordelia toma mas Protagonismo, pues es quien esta con Alvaro en ese momento, despues que el cree que Carlota murio.
Otro detalle importante, que no se entiende mucho en el Dvd es que Cordelia toca el piano, la cancion de amor que a Carlota y Alvaro les gustaba, cosa que no me queda muy claro, ya que Cordelia no tocaba el piano, ademas, como sabia?, quien le dijo que esa era la melodia?, como se entero?, por quien?
La Historia en si, contada por los resumenes del Dvd recien toma protagonismo en el Disco 2, del lado 1, y sobre la parte final, cuando Carlota se va de viaje, en el cruzero y se encuentra con Alvaro y se hace pasar por Cordelia, digamos que fue lo que mas me atrajo, el Inicio y eso, mas las escenas de Cordelia, todas, de las pocas que dejaron, lo demas me aburrio mucho.
El Disco 2 del Lado 2 tiene un Defecto Importante de Edicion y es que los Editores dejaron una misma escena 2 veces, la Escena de cuando Adrian le entrega a Carlota una supuesta carta que le mando por fax Cordelia, se ve 2 veces lo mismo en el Dvd.
La Historia de Adrian, Fabiana y Narciso quedo muy confusa, debido a que sacan muchas escenas sobre eso, y no se entiende lo que pasa.
Tambien falta cuando Bernarda atropella a la mujer de Roman y le hace perder el hijo, cuando Adrian incendia la choza de Cuco, el final de el complice de Adrian, Issac, y la enfermedad y muerte de Regina. Tampoco se ve lo que pasa con Librado, Carlota y Delfino. Solamente se ve una Escena en la que Carlota promete ver, cuidar y hacerse cargo de Librado, el hijo de su hermana Eugenia, pero eso pasa mucho antes del Final.
Se perdio todo lo de la relacion de Eugenia y Santos y de Bernarda y los Roman.
El Personaje de Cordelia Es Exelente, Me Encanta y Jacqueline Andere como Villana Es Magistral.
En Sintesis, el Dvd esta muy bueno solo que para los que ya vimos La Otra de manera Completa hecharemos de menos varias escenas que no estan en el Resumen, pero aun asi vale la pena, Es Muy Buena Telenovela, Exelente Historia y cuenta con un Gran Elenco.",1298505600,,5015,4.197927461139896

3086977,5,B0012E2EWK,"Rubi was a horrible version on DVD and left me with no desire to purchase any other titles but LA OTRA is a different story. This novela was a must for me as it was a huge hit on TV but I wasn't able to watch when it originally aired and luckily now i own it. The story is GREAT, mainly focused on Carlota (Yadhira Carillo) and Alvaros (Juan Soler) love but still we have the evilness and cruelty of Bernarda (Carlotas mother) which adds more Tapatio sauce to this Delicious story. There is a few things that i thought were missing but as the storyline advances the questions are answered. I can see how the storyline was tweeked a bit for the DVD edition but nevertheless GREAT! Very intense and impossible to stop watching, prepare yourself to have LA OTRA take over your life and let the Nail Biting begin.",1279584000,,809,4.364238410596027

3086979,3,B0012E2EWK,"The NOVELA is AWESOME but the DVD VERSION is AWFUL. I've been wanting to buy it for quite some time and after I watched it, I feel very disappointed. The editing is the worst I have ever seen. I have bought several novelas in DVD and this is the WORST EDITING JOB they had done so far. They did not make justice to the novela. They cut all the secondary stories and subplots making it hard to understand for the people that have never seen it before. In my opinion they ruined it with that poorly editing they did.

I WOULD RATE IT A HIGH 5 STAR, BUT YOU MISS SO MUCH WITH THE EDITING.

La novela esta tan MAL EDITADA Y MAL RESUMIDA que si hubiera sabido mejor no la hubiera comprado. La verdad estoy muy decepcionada con la edicion de la novela. No le hicieron justicia al resumirla tan mal. La novela es genial y fuera de lo comun pero la arruinaron al resumirla tan mal para la edicion de DVD. Es dificil de enterder y seguir para la gente que no vio la historia original. Los va a dejar con dudas y preguntas por no aclarar muchos de los acontecimientos importantes especialmente los de los personajes secundarios.

LE HUBIERA DADO 5 ESTRELLAS, PERO SE PERDIO DEMASIADO CON LA EDICION.

The struggles are there and you keeps you thinking how can this situation be solved, right down the last minute!

I love how the camera moves and follows the actors in a continuous scene.

This is the BEST of all the telenovelas I've seen so far (I've seen about a dozen).

3086981,5,B0012E2EWK,"This is one of the most smart, involving and sophisticated telenovelas I have ever seen... and I have seen tons... Smart, because of its story... because it breaks with conventions, with cliches that the typical telenovela contains...This isn't the typical story of a poor heroine meeting a rich man, falling in love, getting married, getting separated by the villain, getting vengeance blah blah blah ...  This is about a love story that unfolds before our eyes, a love story that ends abruptly due to a misunderstanding... It's almost like a comedy of errors with stories within stories, each one as important as the last.... there is no single story that is not interesting or compelling, heartbreaking or involving... or that doesn't add something to the overall main theme of the story...

And then there's the way that it's told... man, I thought I was watching Hitchcock all the way... It used conventions that are usually used in film.... The direction and the mise en scene were pure perfection....from the locations to the way the flashbacks were shot (through the characters point of view. Something that's rare in telenovelas. They usually just repeat the scene.)  just made this the most cinematic telenovela I have ever seen....
and the chilling, eerie, sentimental and heartbreaking score made each scene more powerful and engaging...

And to add more adulation to it, every single actor portrayed their characters to perfection, even the kids, who's acting skills were so natural...  .. everything in this production just flowed so seamlessly and naturally...

This is the VERTIGO and the NOW, VOYAGER for the telenovela world....

BTW I haven't seen this DVD and I hope they didn't change the excellent music. Glad I have the entire telenovela. I couldn't watch an abridged version.",1239062400,,1799,5.098639455782313

3086983,2,B0012E2EWK,"Una historia demasiado melodramtica y hasta depresiva me atrevera a decir! Yadhira Carrillo estuvo bien tanto en Cordelia como en Carlota, pero el carcter sumiso y frgil de esta tlima arruin gran parte de la historia: se la comi prcticamente su madre, interpretada por la primera actriz Jacqueline Andere, cuya maldad y frialdad no me terminaron de convencer... Resulta poco creble que exista en nuestro mundo este tipo de realciones entre madre e hija, entiendo que una siendo joven se somete a las rdenes de su progenitora pero llegando a cierta edad, y sobretodo superando los 30, se ha de liberar de tanta influencia... No s, Carlota fue el personaje que ms odi en la historia, esperaba algn enfrentamiento de alto calibre con su madre pero no, se port como la eterna sumisa hasta el final: por qu no le dio aquella tan esperada bofetada? Por ser su madre? Qu clase de madres es esta? Madres as s merecen ser golpeadas y hasta linchadas! Entiendo que para no ofender al pblico se desisti de la idea que Carlota golpeara al monstruo que tena por madre pero yo creo que se esperaba otro final de parte de los libretistas, qu final ms ridculo el de Bernarda, cayendo en la trampa de Adrin sin que nada le hubiera pasado...
Demasiado drama, demasiado llanto, pareciera que las desdichas del mundo slo le cayeran a la pobre de Carlota, a Yadhira Carrillo se le secaron las lgrima por tanto llorar con ese personaje... hasta super a Adela Noriega famosa por su escenas lacrimgenas!
El resto del reparto estuvo decente, Sergio Sendel, Juan soler y Azela Robinson entregaron buenas actuaciones y me gustara felicitar a la actriz que haca de hija de lvaro y Cordelia, casi se robaba el show!

Though the story line is a bit chopped up in various places in ""La Otra"" from the editing process.... this is still a great novela with a great story and very interesting to watch with excellent acting. To top it off, this is one of the few novelas that has a soundtrack that actually doesn't suck. The music and sound track are very well done and not irritating like so many others. If you were going to have a collection of 5 telenovelas out of the hundreds that exist, this should be one of the five.",1225584000,5,583,4.214285714285714

3086996,5,B0012E2EWK,"I loved this novella, the actors was so great and Yadhira she is acting fantastic. It was easy to follow and I think I watch the whole movie like 2 days. I could not stop it. Thank you for Amazon to make it avalaible to  buy this kind of movie.",1220659200,,244,3.88
3086997,3,B0012E2EWK,"First of all I want to say that this is my favorite soap opera of all time. The other two that I love are Angela and Apuesta por un amor. This was a very clever story, full of surprises and discovery. I agree this was Juan Soler's best leading role. Yadhira Carrillo was amazing. She gave a extraordinary personal touch to her two characters, and could at the same time show the humanity of Carlota even when she was taking Cordelia's place. Jacqueline Andere was one of the smartest villains I have ever seen in a telenovela.

The problem with the DVD is the editing. They focus mostly in the story of Alvaro and Carlota and cut off many of the secondary character stories. There was not much of the romance of Bernarda and Roman, the story of Cordelia's family was totally deleted, when Carlota became Cordelia they were many scenes in which you could have been caught, for example the dog scene (Cordelia did not like dogs), the scene when Carlota is drowning (Cordelia could swim). These were the funny scenes of the story and they are gone. Also, the DVD does not cover Regina's disease, and does not show when she dies. For people that never watched the show it will be confusing to hear some things when they did not have the proper background to understand. And finally, the DVD did not show Bernarda's ending which I think was a big mistake. The ending is disturbing, because after all that she did, she escapes and in the last scene she is shown in the beach flirting with young guys.

The soap opera is the best, the DVD did not do a good job. I still recommend it.",1217030400,3,1576,4.431034482758621
3086998,4,B0012E2EWK,"Overall, I thought that this telenovela was well done, the plot was expertly executed, and Juan Soler and Yadhira Carrillo did a fantastic job in their respective roles.
Like a previous customer said, Yadhira Carrillo has that uncanny ability to cry overflowing tears at the snap of a finger. She played Carlota very realistically, conveying to the viewers the suffering and the depression the character felt. In portraying Cordelia she switched gears and played a conniving and superficial character, much the opposite of the sweet and docile Carlota. As always Jacqueline Andere played marvelously as a villain, cold-hearted mother and killer, as well as Sergio Sendel as another villain who uses his charms to lure innocent people for his own perverted use. Juan Soler did an outstanding job, especially with those scenes when the character of Alvaro was quite confused between Carlota and Cordelia. I believed that he was going to go crazy because he didn't know what was really happening, who died and who was still alive.
Now...here comes the spoilers...so an alert here for those that haven't watched it:
Unfortunately I didn't get to watch ""La Otra"" in its entirety on Univision, and this was the very first time I watched it. So, I knew it was going to be very much edited to have this telenovela on 3 DVDs. That being said, although I did follow the storyline, and knew what was happening, I felt that there were some subplots and characters that were missing. Although I must say that I googled ""La Otra"", and read some well-written summaries, and knew that there were some parts missing. But, nonetheless, here are some things that stood out for me:
1) I knew that in some way Roman Guillen (Carlota's half-brother) would be involved with Bernarda (Carlota's mean-spirited mother). This is very obvious if you look on the back cover of the DVD. I know Roman, as Raul, uses Bernarda to exact revenge for stealing his father's inheritance. But this subplot is totally taken out of this version. So, exactly I don't know what happens.
2) Who is Julieta? Was she another innocent woman that Roman used to exact revenge? And why does Carlota tell her that she's like a sister to her? I know that Bernarda hit her with the car, and caused Julieta to lose her baby, at least that's what Roman accuses Bernarda before she kills him at the side of the road. So Julieta's story doesn't even appear here, not until the end.
3) Although they talk about Eugenia's son Librado, they don't show him at all, I don't know if he really appeared on the telenovela; also, the fact that Santos married Eugenia to give her baby a name is totally taken out of the story. It's only mentioned, but we are never given a full explanation.
4) Also, we see in flashbacks that Cordelia caused Alvaro's mother, Lupita, to have a heart attack and die, but we never really meet her on the story. Just see her in two scenes.
**end of possible spoilers**
There are many other little questions that really don't matter to be put in here, but those are four big ones. Also, I titled this review ""Mexican Gothic telenovela"" because that is what I felt I was watching. Even if there weren't any ghosts, or it wasn't set in dark places or had any supernatural effect, it still conveyed that ""Gothic"" element. Let me explain: with the house in Queretaro, which is an old colonial city in central Mexico, it's an old house, evidently from colonial times; the inside is dark, because of it's wooden dark-panneled walls, old-fashioned furniture. It didn't seem like a house set in the 21st century. This is also the case in La Santisima, Alvaro's family hacienda: old-fashioned 19th century furniture (or so it seems), dark wood walls, and the dark bungalow, with its airy and flowy bedroom veils where it seemed sometimes a ghost may appear. Oh, and let's not forget the Hitchcock-like haunting theme music throughout, with it's dark and somber cello and spine-tingling violin. Chopin's romantic piano music also lends to this ""Gothic"" theme, very beautiful but very haunting, almost melancholy and--sometimes--outright depressing. I'm not sure if this was the case in its original version, but boy this was quite obvious in this version. I have a little ""complaint"" about this too. Most if not all telenovelas, even if it's a serious plot-driven one, usually has a slice of comic relief to break the seriousness of a story. Although I may totally wrong because this was edited out, I didn't see any comic relief at all. It was just haunting, dark and somber all throughout. A few funny characters or comic scenes would've helped! For example, if you watched ""Amarte Es Mi Pecado"" (another Yadhira Carrillo telenovela) it was also a serious-driven telenovela, but it had its comic relief through the likes of Silvia Pasquel playing a very funny villainess and Casilda a very funny character with its hideous teeth; let's not forget Casilda's aunt and her strange characteristic of wearing different wigs. That was very much a comic relief, and it gave us a break from the main plot. But I didn't see this in ""La Otra"", unless there were funny characters and scenes in its original version that may have been edited out completely from the DVD version. If this is the case, then shame to those who edited it, it may have made this DVD version a lot better if they included some comic relief. All in all, I thought this was a wonderful telenovela, very realistic, although I can't imagine having another person being a double of me in spite of not being twins. I think that was the only unrealistic thing about it, but very much a central theme to this novela. The settings were beautiful, the acting was very real, the villains were devilishly good, and that music...God, that music really made this telenovela that much atmospheric, it made me feel melancholic, and it just gave me the chills just listening to it. The use of Chopin's work is also very well done. The only thing I have against it is the editing of important subplots and characters and the lack of comic relief and characters. But, I still highly recommend this one, one of the many very well done Mexican telenovelas!",1214697600,6,6154,4.773921200750469

3087000,3,B0012E2EWK,This is a telenovela that has a great plot with a wonderful exploration of a very tense mother-daughter relationship. The novela delves into the impact of emotional abuse and shows its long lasting effects. BUT this novela is cut down to a bare minimum especially towards the end where the editor leaves the viewer with lots of questions. The producers of telenovelas should really just release the videos with no editing or minimal editing since the magic of the telenovela is in the details and in the secondary plots. So great plot but as a DVD I do not recommend it highly. Try Azul Tequila which is uncut and fabulous. We need more telenovelas like Azul Tequila.,1211846400,3,667,4.7094017094017095

La Otra one may actually ruin you for other telenovelas because the standard is set so high.  The acting, writing, and directing really came together on this one.  Yadhira Carrillo excels in the dual role of Carlota and Cordelia.  She and Juan Soler have that supercouple factor.

If you watched this telenovela on TV, fear not.  The music score is still intact.  The Chopin and the cello and the violins are still in the right spots.

Those new to La Otra may be surprised to know that although we follow several years in the lives of these characters, the program ran for only four months.  There isn't time for any slow parts.",1207699200,,728,4.669291338582677
3087003,5,B0012E2EWK,"Summary of La Otra

Carlota Guillen (Carrillo) lives in Queretaro with her mother Bernarda (Andere) and her older sister Eugenia. Bernarda pretends to be a respected lady, but in reality she was a lover of Leopoldo, the rich man from Guadalajara. Carlota is his daughter and the half-sister of Roman, who is the only legitimate son of Leopoldo. Roman found out that Leopoldo divided the heritage between him and the daughters of Bernanda and plans a revenge. Carlota meets Alvaro Ibaez, the young doctor. Alvaro is from Mexico City and has a younger brother, Adrian, who was adopted by his parents, and in spite of the fact that his parents always treated them both the same way, he hates Alvaro. Bernarda knows that when her daughters marry she'll have to give them their heritage. She doesn't want to lose control over the money, and therefore is against each and every man that comes close to her daughters. Nevertheless, Roman managed to seduce Eugenia and left her pregnant. Eugenia dies due to the complications after the childbirth. Supposedly, the grandchild of Bernarda died right after his birth, but he is alive. When Bernarda's daughter dies, Alvaro thinks it was Carlota who died and, inconsolable, leaves the city and goes to live with his parents in Morelos. Over there, Alvaro meets Cordelia Portugal, who is identical to Carlota and taking advantage of it, occupies the place of The Other.",1206057600,,1406,4.932489451476793

3321449,5,B0012E2EWK,"La Otra (The Other - 665 minutes) Best Ever! I got my DVD from Amazon as soon as I saw this one from the library. It is absolutely essential that you suspend disbelief as a doppleganger for one gal steps into the life (and marital bed!) of another.

Years ago, the gorgeous Bernarda (Jacqueline Andere) married a millionaire while pregnant with her first daughter Eugenia (Mercedes Molto), whom she passed off as his. Soon after, they had another girl, Carlota (Yadhira Carrillo). When the millionaire died, his will stipulated that his fortune would pass to his daughters upon their marriages.

Obviously Bernarda has devoted her life to making sure neither daughter ever marries. When Eugenia gets pregnant and is abandoned (by that millionaire's son, who is seeking revenge for losing his father to the fortune hunter), she runs away and dies in childbirth. Sweet (weepy) Carlota is told she has an exact double but dismisses the idea. She has met a medical student Alvaro (Juan Soler), with whom she falls passionately in love. When her sister dies, her mother makes the medical student think it is Carlota, so he leaves for Mexico City, heartbroken.

Her conniving doppleganger Cordelia (also played by Yadhira Carrillo), seduces him into a loveless marriage, which produces a much-adored daughter. Loaded with coincidences, well-meaning friends, relatives and priests, everything manages to keep them apart for 10 years: She thinking he abandoned her at the altar, he thinking she is long-dead. Both of the attractive leads are nice people to root for, the villains are truly hiss-worthy and the little girl is wonderfully directed. This actor is a FIND!",1367107200,,1660,5.095588235294118

3321472,3,B0012E2EWK,"El Producto me llego Mal, los Discos Estan Rayados, el Dvd 2 se congela la imagen y se tranca en varias partes, es muy molesto. Y el Disco 3 del Lado 2 no se ve casi nada, sobre todo en el Comienzo y en el Final de la Telenovela. Al Limpiar los Discos con una Franela Nueva, Sin Uso, logre que se viera un poco mas, pero los Discos Estan Rayados.
En cuanto a el Resumen de la Telenovela Me Gusto, aunque podria haber sido muchisimo mejor.
El Final de Cordelia esta editado, no se ve cuando ella corta la luz de la casa y Adrian sale afuera a ver que pasa, llama a la Empleada (Simona) y ella le dice que seguramente alguno de los trabajadores bajo la llave sin querer, y eso lo entiendo, porque en el Final esa mujer tiene gran importancia, ya que es la que lleva el maletin que Bernarda le pidio a Adrian a cambio de la combinacion de la caja fuerte, escena que por supuesto no esta en el Dvd, por eso las quitaron.
Estoy Muy Molesto porque sacaron mucho del Final, podrian haber dejado un poco mas, un capitulo de mas de 40 Minutos lo Resumen en menos de 20 Minutos.
Faltan Muchas Escenas, sobre todo cuando Bernarda se le escapa a Adrian al sacar el dinero del banco y el la persigue en un taxi, la llama al celular y le dice que ya llamo a la Policia, que les dijo todo lo sabe de ella, que le conviene fugarse con el, luego los dos van a la terraza de un edificio, en el cual discuten por el dinero y Adrian se lo trata de arrebatar y se les cae el maletin. Despues pactan un arreglo, en el que Bernarda le promete dar la combinacion de la caja fuerte de la casa siempre y cuando el le deje el otro maletin en el lugar que acordaron. Lo que sucede despues si esta en el Resumen, lo unico que me molesto es que no tenga la escena final en la que se ve a Bernarda en otro pais, haciendo de las suyas, que evidentemente, se habia fugado con el dinero despues de matar a Adrian, escena clave e importante, ya que ese era su Final. Tambien falta la Escena en que Carlota habla con el hijo de su hermana Eugenia, que la verdad es preciosa, es una pena que la hayan quitado.
A mi en lo Personal se me hizo algo aburrida la Novela, en los Inicios tiene muy buenas escenas de Jacqueline Andere con Yadhira Carrillo, discuciones, dialogos, escenas fuertes pero el Lado 2 del Disco 1 y el Dvd 2 del Lado 1 se me hizo muy aburrido y molesto de ver ya que Carlota se la pasa llorando por Alvaro y su Hermana Eugenia. Es un fastidio ver todo el tiempo, una y otra vez a Carlota llorar con el Piano que Alvaro le regalo. Podrian al menos haber sacado alguna de esas escenas reiterativas que siempre muestran lo mismo, llanto y mas llanto.
En el Dvd 1, sobre el final falta algo importante en la Historia, la Muerte de Eugenia, la Hermana de Carlota. Se ve cuando Bernarda le da la noticia a Carlota, pero no cuando Eugenia Muere.
Por otra parte considero que quitaron muchas escenas importantes de Cordelia para dejar mas de Carlota y Alvaro, cosa que me parece muy mal, ya que en esas escenas Cordelia toma mas Protagonismo, pues es quien esta con Alvaro en ese momento, despues que el cree que Carlota murio.
Otro detalle importante, que no se entiende mucho en el Dvd es que Cordelia toca el piano, la cancion de amor que a Carlota y Alvaro les gustaba, cosa que no me queda muy claro, ya que Cordelia no tocaba el piano, ademas, como sabia?, quien le dijo que esa era la melodia?, como se entero?, por quien?
La Historia en si, contada por los resumenes del Dvd recien toma protagonismo en el Disco 2, del lado 1, y sobre la parte final, cuando Carlota se va de viaje, en el cruzero y se encuentra con Alvaro y se hace pasar por Cordelia, digamos que fue lo que mas me atrajo, el Inicio y eso, mas las escenas de Cordelia, todas, de las pocas que dejaron, lo demas me aburrio mucho.
El Disco 2 del Lado 2 tiene un Defecto Importante de Edicion y es que los Editores dejaron una misma escena 2 veces, la Escena de cuando Adrian le entrega a Carlota una supuesta carta que le mando por fax Cordelia, se ve 2 veces lo mismo en el Dvd.
La Historia de Adrian, Fabiana y Narciso quedo muy confusa, debido a que sacan muchas escenas sobre eso, y no se entiende lo que pasa.
Tambien falta cuando Bernarda atropella a la mujer de Roman y le hace perder el hijo, cuando Adrian incendia la choza de Cuco, el final de el complice de Adrian, Issac, y la enfermedad y muerte de Regina. Tampoco se ve lo que pasa con Librado, Carlota y Delfino. Solamente se ve una Escena en la que Carlota promete ver, cuidar y hacerse cargo de Librado, el hijo de su hermana Eugenia, pero eso pasa mucho antes del Final.
Se perdio todo lo de la relacion de Eugenia y Santos y de Bernarda y los Roman.
El Personaje de Cordelia Es Exelente, Me Encanta y Jacqueline Andere como Villana Es Magistral.
En Sintesis, el Dvd esta muy bueno solo que para los que ya vimos La Otra de manera Completa hecharemos de menos varias escenas que no estan en el Resumen, pero aun asi vale la pena, Es Muy Buena Telenovela, Exelente Historia y cuenta con un Gran Elenco.",1298505600,,5015,4.197927461139896

They cut all the secondary stories and subplots making it hard to understand for the people that have never seen it before. In my opinion they ruined it with that poorly editing they did.

I WOULD RATE IT A HIGH 5 STAR, BUT YOU MISS SO MUCH WITH THE EDITING.

La novela esta tan MAL EDITADA Y MAL RESUMIDA que si hubiera sabido mejor no la hubiera comprado. La verdad estoy muy decepcionada con la edicion de la novela. No le hicieron justicia al resumirla tan mal. La novela es genial y fuera de lo comun pero la arruinaron al resumirla tan mal para la edicion de DVD. Es dificil de enterder y seguir para la gente que no vio la historia original. Los va a dejar con dudas y preguntas por no aclarar muchos de los acontecimientos importantes especialmente los de los personajes secundarios.

3321478,5,B0012E2EWK,"This is one of the most smart, involving and sophisticated telenovelas I have ever seen... and I have seen tons... Smart, because of its story... because it breaks with conventions, with cliches that the typical telenovela contains...This isn't the typical story of a poor heroine meeting a rich man, falling in love, getting married, getting separated by the villain, getting vengeance blah blah blah ...  This is about a love story that unfolds before our eyes, a love story that ends abruptly due to a misunderstanding... It's almost like a comedy of errors with stories within stories, each one as important as the last.... there is no single story that is not interesting or compelling, heartbreaking or involving... or that doesn't add something to the overall main theme of the story...

And then there's the way that it's told... man, I thought I was watching Hitchcock all the way... It used conventions that are usually used in film.... The direction and the mise en scene were pure perfection....from the locations to the way the flashbacks were shot (through the characters point of view. Something that's rare in telenovelas. They usually just repeat the scene.)  just made this the most cinematic telenovela I have ever seen....
and the chilling, eerie, sentimental and heartbreaking score made each scene more powerful and engaging...

And to add more adulation to it, every single actor portrayed their characters to perfection, even the kids, who's acting skills were so natural...  .. everything in this production just flowed so seamlessly and naturally...

This is the VERTIGO and the NOW, VOYAGER for the telenovela world....

Yadhira Carrillo estuvo bien tanto en Cordelia como en Carlota, pero el carcter sumiso y frgil de esta tlima arruin gran parte de la historia: se la comi prcticamente su madre, interpretada por la primera actriz Jacqueline Andere, cuya maldad y frialdad no me terminaron de convencer... Resulta poco creble que exista en nuestro mundo este tipo de realciones entre madre e hija, entiendo que una siendo joven se somete a las rdenes de su progenitora pero llegando a cierta edad, y sobretodo superando los 30, se ha de liberar de tanta influencia... No s, Carlota fue el personaje que ms odi en la historia, esperaba algn enfrentamiento de alto calibre con su madre pero no, se port como la eterna sumisa hasta el final: por qu no le dio aquella tan esperada bofetada? Por ser su madre? Qu clase de madres es esta? Madres as s merecen ser golpeadas y hasta linchadas!

3321494,3,B0012E2EWK,"First of all I want to say that this is my favorite soap opera of all time. The other two that I love are Angela and Apuesta por un amor. This was a very clever story, full of surprises and discovery. I agree this was Juan Soler's best leading role. Yadhira Carrillo was amazing. She gave a extraordinary personal touch to her two characters, and could at the same time show the humanity of Carlota even when she was taking Cordelia's place. Jacqueline Andere was one of the smartest villains I have ever seen in a telenovela.

The problem with the DVD is the editing. They focus mostly in the story of Alvaro and Carlota and cut off many of the secondary character stories. There was not much of the romance of Bernarda and Roman, the story of Cordelia's family was totally deleted, when Carlota became Cordelia they were many scenes in which you could have been caught, for example the dog scene (Cordelia did not like dogs), the scene when Carlota is drowning (Cordelia could swim). These were the funny scenes of the story and they are gone. Also, the DVD does not cover Regina's disease, and does not show when she dies. For people that never watched the show it will be confusing to hear some things when they did not have the proper background to understand. And finally, the DVD did not show Bernarda's ending which I think was a big mistake. The ending is disturbing, because after all that she did, she escapes and in the last scene she is shown in the beach flirting with young guys.

The soap opera is the best, the DVD did not do a good job. I still recommend it.",1217030400,3,1576,4.431034482758621
3321495,4,B0012E2EWK,"Overall, I thought that this telenovela was well done, the plot was expertly executed, and Juan Soler and Yadhira Carrillo did a fantastic job in their respective roles.
Like a previous customer said, Yadhira Carrillo has that uncanny ability to cry overflowing tears at the snap of a finger. She played Carlota very realistically, conveying to the viewers the suffering and the depression the character felt. In portraying Cordelia she switched gears and played a conniving and superficial character, much the opposite of the sweet and docile Carlota. As always Jacqueline Andere played marvelously as a villain, cold-hearted mother and killer, as well as Sergio Sendel as another villain who uses his charms to lure innocent people for his own perverted use. Juan Soler did an outstanding job, especially with those scenes when the character of Alvaro was quite confused between Carlota and Cordelia. I believed that he was going to go crazy because he didn't know what was really happening, who died and who was still alive.
Now...here comes the spoilers...so an alert here for those that haven't watched it:
Unfortunately I didn't get to watch ""La Otra"" in its entirety on Univision, and this was the very first time I watched it. So, I knew it was going to be very much edited to have this telenovela on 3 DVDs. That being said, although I did follow the storyline, and knew what was happening, I felt that there were some subplots and characters that were missing. Although I must say that I googled ""La Otra"", and read some well-written summaries, and knew that there were some parts missing. But, nonetheless, here are some things that stood out for me:
1) I knew that in some way Roman Guillen (Carlota's half-brother) would be involved with Bernarda (Carlota's mean-spirited mother). This is very obvious if you look on the back cover of the DVD. I know Roman, as Raul, uses Bernarda to exact revenge for stealing his father's inheritance. But this subplot is totally taken out of this version. So, exactly I don't know what happens.
2) Who is Julieta? Was she another innocent woman that Roman used to exact revenge? And why does Carlota tell her that she's like a sister to her? I know that Bernarda hit her with the car, and caused Julieta to lose her baby, at least that's what Roman accuses Bernarda before she kills him at the side of the road. So Julieta's story doesn't even appear here, not until the end.
3) Although they talk about Eugenia's son Librado, they don't show him at all, I don't know if he really appeared on the telenovela; also, the fact that Santos married Eugenia to give her baby a name is totally taken out of the story. It's only mentioned, but we are never given a full explanation.
4) Also, we see in flashbacks that Cordelia caused Alvaro's mother, Lupita, to have a heart attack and die, but we never really meet her on the story. Just see her in two scenes.
**end of possible spoilers**
There are many other little questions that really don't matter to be put in here, but those are four big ones. Also, I titled this review ""Mexican Gothic telenovela"" because that is what I felt I was watching. Even if there weren't any ghosts, or it wasn't set in dark places or had any supernatural effect, it still conveyed that ""Gothic"" element. Let me explain: with the house in Queretaro, which is an old colonial city in central Mexico, it's an old house, evidently from colonial times; the inside is dark, because of it's wooden dark-panneled walls, old-fashioned furniture. It didn't seem like a house set in the 21st century. This is also the case in La Santisima, Alvaro's family hacienda: old-fashioned 19th century furniture (or so it seems), dark wood walls, and the dark bungalow, with its airy and flowy bedroom veils where it seemed sometimes a ghost may appear. Oh, and let's not forget the Hitchcock-like haunting theme music throughout, with it's dark and somber cello and spine-tingling violin. Chopin's romantic piano music also lends to this ""Gothic"" theme, very beautiful but very haunting, almost melancholy and--sometimes--outright depressing. I'm not sure if this was the case in its original version, but boy this was quite obvious in this version. I have a little ""complaint"" about this too. Most if not all telenovelas, even if it's a serious plot-driven one, usually has a slice of comic relief to break the seriousness of a story. Although I may totally wrong because this was edited out, I didn't see any comic relief at all. It was just haunting, dark and somber all throughout. A few funny characters or comic scenes would've helped! For example, if you watched ""Amarte Es Mi Pecado"" (another Yadhira Carrillo telenovela) it was also a serious-driven telenovela, but it had its comic relief through the likes of Silvia Pasquel playing a very funny villainess and Casilda a very funny character with its hideous teeth; let's not forget Casilda's aunt and her strange characteristic of wearing different wigs. That was very much a comic relief, and it gave us a break from the main plot. But I didn't see this in ""La Otra"", unless there were funny characters and scenes in its original version that may have been edited out completely from the DVD version. If this is the case, then shame to those who edited it, it may have made this DVD version a lot better if they included some comic relief. All in all, I thought this was a wonderful telenovela, very realistic, although I can't imagine having another person being a double of me in spite of not being twins. I think that was the only unrealistic thing about it, but very much a central theme to this novela. The settings were beautiful, the acting was very real, the villains were devilishly good, and that music...God, that music really made this telenovela that much atmospheric, it made me feel melancholic, and it just gave me the chills just listening to it. The use of Chopin's work is also very well done. The only thing I have against it is the editing of important subplots and characters and the lack of comic relief and characters. But, I still highly recommend this one, one of the many very well done Mexican telenovelas!",1214697600,6,6154,4.773921200750469

3321497,3,B0012E2EWK,This is a telenovela that has a great plot with a wonderful exploration of a very tense mother-daughter relationship. The novela delves into the impact of emotional abuse and shows its long lasting effects. BUT this novela is cut down to a bare minimum especially towards the end where the editor leaves the viewer with lots of questions. The producers of telenovelas should really just release the videos with no editing or minimal editing since the magic of the telenovela is in the details and in the secondary plots. So great plot but as a DVD I do not recommend it highly. Try Azul Tequila which is uncut and fabulous. We need more telenovelas like Azul Tequila.,1211846400,3,667,4.7094017094017095

3321499,5,B0012E2EWK,"If you've only watched American soaps, try a telenovela.  This one has optional English subtitles. La Otra one may actually ruin you for other telenovelas because the standard is set so high.  The acting, writing, and directing really came together on this one.  Yadhira Carrillo excels in the dual role of Carlota and Cordelia.  She and Juan Soler have that supercouple factor.

If you watched this telenovela on TV, fear not.  The music score is still intact.  The Chopin and the cello and the violins are still in the right spots.

Those new to La Otra may be surprised to know that although we follow several years in the lives of these characters, the program ran for only four months.  There isn't time for any slow parts.",1207699200,,728,4.669291338582677
3321500,5,B0012E2EWK,"Summary of La Otra

Carlota Guillen (Carrillo) lives in Queretaro with her mother Bernarda (Andere) and her older sister Eugenia. Bernarda pretends to be a respected lady, but in reality she was a lover of Leopoldo, the rich man from Guadalajara. Carlota is his daughter and the half-sister of Roman, who is the only legitimate son of Leopoldo. Roman found out that Leopoldo divided the heritage between him and the daughters of Bernanda and plans a revenge. Carlota meets Alvaro Ibaez, the young doctor. Alvaro is from Mexico City and has a younger brother, Adrian, who was adopted by his parents, and in spite of the fact that his parents always treated them both the same way, he hates Alvaro. Bernarda knows that when her daughters marry she'll have to give them their heritage. She doesn't want to lose control over the money, and therefore is against each and every man that comes close to her daughters. Nevertheless, Roman managed to seduce Eugenia and left her pregnant. Eugenia dies due to the complications after the childbirth. Supposedly, the grandchild of Bernarda died right after his birth, but he is alive. When Bernarda's daughter dies, Alvaro thinks it was Carlota who died and, inconsolable, leaves the city and goes to live with his parents in Morelos. Over there, Alvaro meets Cordelia Portugal, who is identical to Carlota and taking advantage of it, occupies the place of The Other.",1206057600,,1406,4.932489451476793
