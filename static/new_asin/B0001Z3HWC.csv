2043487,1,B0001Z3HWC,"i've been a big fan of dean cain since superman and his guest role on 90210, as well as a fan of sarah brown since her vr trooper days and general hospital days so i expected this movie to be good. unfortuantely, it wasnt. it wasn't because of the acting, but i think it was more of the writing of the movie. it did portray scott as guilty all over. they made dean studder and pretend to be trying to act all innocent, jus gearing at us, the audience to make him guilty. maybe they should have waited more til AFTER the trial was over and take their time into actually writing down more accurate facts before they rushed into the made for tv movie. i mean, if u want the public to know the truth, thats fine. jus as long as its the REAL truth, not sum bs that was made up to give the movie more publicity.",1131321600,,805,4.069182389937107
2043488,3,B0001Z3HWC,"Dean Cain was very good in his role of Scott Peterson, portraying his selfishness, his neurotic sense of self-control and his sociopathic disregard for his wife Laci.

I think the movie could have been stronger in several ways.  the character of Laci could have been developed to a greater degree giving the viewers more of a feel for the full tragedy of her death.  Laci's parents also lacked a completeness. They were too dumbed down for the lowest common denominator TV watchers.

Amber Frey's portrayal was good, but I wish they would have shown more about how she and Scott first met and how he managed to never mention his wife.  Peterson was portrayed very well as a slimey manipulator with more love of his orgasms than other people who get in the ways of his plans.",1129593600,11,774,4.62043795620438
2043489,4,B0001Z3HWC,"Some of the facts were a little off. And Amber could have been cast better. The most powerful performance was of course Dean Cain. And a close second was played by Lacys Blond best friend. I started crying when she had to explain to her husband that she saw Amy go into the house with the police to search for the clothes Lacy was wearing the night of the haircut. ""This is specific Tommy, Those clothes are in the bay with her"" HEAVY",1113004800,23,434,4.240963855421687
2043490,3,B0001Z3HWC,obviously court tv wanted to be the first to make a movie about the whole scott peterson affair and they succeeded admirably...however they could have 1. waited until the outcome of the trial 2. re-enacted what if was like when laci was alive. There is nothing about laci in the whole movie which I think is pretty damned odd. I think much time was spent focusing in on Scott Peterson but is sociopathic tendencies are left out and had there been more time that went  by we could see a more accurate movie with inclusion of everyone that was involved. I liked the movie but didn't see it until after the trial...I think we need a do-over.,1112227200,8,638,4.452991452991453
2043491,1,B0001Z3HWC,"The review made this movie sound really good.  Yeah right, (make sure and read the reviews!!!)  I found this movie to be only about Scott, his feelings, his life etc.who cares anyway.  Not much about Laci, and her life like I thought would be in the movie.  I cannot believe how bad this movie was.  I was a real Peterson trial junkie, and I knew alot about Scott and Laci and the families, this movie did not portray anyone else just Scott.  Really a crappy movie, don't bother buying.

I wasted my $18.00, watched it, and promptly threw it away.  Didn't want another person throwing their money away like I did.",1112140800,3,613,4.45945945945946
2043492,3,B0001Z3HWC,"This movie focused to much on Scott and not enough on Laci. I would have enjoyed this movie more if they let us in more on Laci as a person before she was missing. I also found this to be off on some facts. The movie says based on a true story. So I suppose I can't really complain about that. I didn't feel the acting was all that good. I think Court TV did better trial coverage then this book did. Either way Laci was the victim and I hope Scott thinks about his crime and suffers horrible nightmares everyday he is alive. The movie didn't focus enough on his Switch personality, Charisma, or enough on his lies. I don't think anyone will ever know the real Scott Peterson, because he doesn't know himself. Will we ever know the truth? The only people who know aren't talking, and one can't. My heart goes out to Laci's family! SAD",1108252800,2,834,4.251572327044025
2043493,4,B0001Z3HWC,"When I first discovered that Dean Cain was cast to play Scott Peterson, I got goosebumps all over because of the uncanny resemblance of the two men.  While the movie is good and interesting, it is far from being impartial.  It focuses too much on Scott Peterson and every little thing that pertained to him (his actions, behavior, etc.).
I believe that all people have the right to a fair trial and to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  This movie has Scott Peterson walking around with ""GUILTY"" written all over him.  Hypothetically speaking, what if the Laci Peterson murder was something that was similar to the Dr. Sam Sheppard case?  Don't get me wrong here - I have strong feelings about the Peterson case and will freely admit that I think Scott had a major role in Laci's death, however I do believe that the justice system needs to be utilized in the appropriate manner.
The movie is mostly about Scott Peterson more than it is about Laci.  Nevertheless, it is an interesting movie to watch.",1089590400,23,1008,4.666666666666667
2043514,4,B0001Z3HWC,"I was just 12 years old when this story hit the news channels. I was already watching bio channel's true crime shows at the time, and thus seeing this unfold in real time was sometimes scary as I realize that what I see on the bio channel is what this story of the Petersons were for many families and nations before.

As I grew older, this case imprinted on my mind as it did for many Americans. What I didn't do, is sell my soul to the thing, and read in a frenzy everything I could on it. However, this movie I caught at age 13 on TV was always on my mind too... Now older, I ordered it just to see it again, as well as read Scott's sister's book.

I found that the movie, as most movies do, took a few liberties, never the less it captured the ""spirit"" of the time, with wanting to believe a man is innocent, until - like the constitution says - is proven guilty. And boy is that proven.

 Maybe the makers did it out of convince or respect, or who knows - maybe they were forced. But I think authenticity would've given it another star on my review. Reading Anne Bird's book will fill in the blanks where this movie left them. But a few events, times, places, and even names were changed. There is one fictional prominent character in the movie that I think was supposed to be Anne Bird. And the movie changed sexes. Maybe that was Anne's personal wish. But if not, I always question movie-makers intent when they seek to make a move ""inspired"" or ""based"" or simply crediting it as ""a real story,"" knowing full well it's not entirely true or real.",1444176000,2,1552,4.233108108108108

2043517,4,B0001Z3HWC,"The best thing about this movie is Dean Cain's spookily accurate portrayal of Scott Peterson.  I was fascinated and horrified by this case when it occurred and read many of the available books on the subject.  The movie provides the same information, but it is still interesting.  The movie also does a good job covering all of the major points of the case, given the limited time and format.  This is worth watching.",1434153600,3,417,4.671232876712328

2043519,2,B0001Z3HWC,"It could have been better if Sarah Joy Brown wasn't constantly making this public announcement about how great Laci was and how ""wrong"" Scott is. We all know that. Dean Cain made the film much better, but it just was too much bitchy talk for the great womens' libber unite instead of just telling the story as it happened. I doubt that the friends and family were going on and on like this and THAT is what reduced my review for this one. Again, this is worth watching on cable, not worth purchasing and watching with your hubby. LMN should just allow the story to be told as it happened and STOP plugging in these over bearing female composite characters because it was getting highly annoying to listen to Brown go on and on with her feelings towards Peterson. The actual story could reveal this for itself with out her going on and on and nagging about how ""bad"" he is. If they could have edited all the scenes with her bitching and crying and losing it (when she wasn't even a family member) it just would have been a more thrilling story as is. But the plugging the female message in takes so much away from these LMN movies that guys will not watch these movies anymore with women because of the constant bitching and making a message factor. We know that Laci did not deserve to die, but did we actually need to listen to Sarah Joy Brown make a constant stink over it. Besides, no one thought that Scott did anything until detectives began investigating more into different facets of Scott's life and really until the girlfriend announced that she was having an affair with him. NO ONE accused Scott so early into the investigation as this Sarah Joy Brown had. We really could not stand her or who ever wrote these ridiculous lines for her because we did not need the public service announcement for the MS foundation. Just tell the story as it happened please. Can't you do that for a change LMN. Leave out the BS female composites because it is irritating and folks just want to listen to the facts and not the major message. Let the actual situation evolve to what we need to know. Just watch it on cable.",1431734400,2,2115,4.453608247422681

2043534,3,B0001Z3HWC,"The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story is a TV movie based on the life of Laci Peterson and her husband,Scott.

It is a crime story that captivated and shocked a nation about the California man whose pregnant wife Laci was reported missing on Christmas Eve in 2002 which has triggered a search party that soon realizes its mission is moot when the police make public their suspicions of foul play. Laci's family lends Scott their support until his mistress surfaces, making him the prime suspect. In 2003, the body of Laci and Scott's unborn son washed up on shore: the remains of a torso later identified as Laci washed up a few miles away from the baby's remains, and the two were officially declared murdered. Scott was arrested.

The performances were decent except for Dean Cain,who was very good in his role of Scott Peterson, portraying his selfishness, his neurotic sense of self-control and his sociopath tendencies as well as his complete disregard for his wife Laci. Character development could have been stronger if the character of Laci could have been developed to a greater degree giving the viewers more of a feel for the full tragedy of her death. Laci's parents also lacked a completeness. They were too toned down for TV viewers. Overall,it could have been a better TV movie if these weren't really considered and if the filmmakers focused on telling a story behind a tragedy.",1416787200,,1401,4.833333333333333

2043538,4,B0001Z3HWC,"Headlines told the story of Laci Peterson and the search to find her and her unborn son, Connor.  Dean Cain could be Scott Peterson's twin.  Cain portrayed Laci's husband so well that I felt I was watching the story unfold.  This movie was made before the verdict, but the entire story follows all police and news reports of this story.  Each character has such a close resemblance to the people they portray, I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie.  Dee Wallace's performance, as Laci's mother, has a heartbreaking scene when Laci and Connor are found.  It will give you chills when you see it.  I don't think I've ever seen a true story reach as far as The Perfect Husband has in its authenticity and selective casting.  When it comes on tv, I will watch it.  The heartbreak of this true story reached hearts across the country and this movie has done justice to Laci and her life with Scott.",1398643200,,902,4.518518518518518

2043563,2,B0001Z3HWC,"Dean Cain did a decent job playing Scott Peterson in this made for TV movie, but quite honestly the story was a bit too choppy to be liked completely.  The story of Scott's lies were told as they unfolded, and what a liar he was!  As Scott was playing the happy family man who was reluctantly waiting for the arrival of his first child with his wife, Laci, he was leading a double life as a swinging single bachelor with his girlfriend Amber on the side.  Amber is a subject of pity, no question, as she was lied to and drawn into this media circus as an innocent, but his phone calls to her are almost hilarious as he attempts to lie to Amber, his family and the public of his innocence.  It's an ok profile of Scott the man, might give others insights into how he tried to lie and cheat and sneak his way out of the murder, but it leaves a few things to the imagination of wanting him to just fess up.  Then again, that's how Scott was/is.",1356825600,,941,4.148351648351649

I'm pretty good about keeping and open mind, and also get good and bad vibes. With him, SCOTT PETERSON, I knew he did it. Just hated it took so long for them to catch him. So of course when the movie came out, (I have to say) they couldn't have picked a better actor than DEAN CANE, it was actually very eery to see the resemblence of them.

The Amber Frey calls were ridiculously off, along with the basic facts. Dean Cain, like everyone has previously said, did an amazing job and it's amazing how much he looks like scott. After reading almost everything there is to read about Scott, I'm bothered by this film because it is very one sided. The questions ""Tommy"" asked were legitimate and it seemed like that was the only time they let you doubt that Scott was guilty but in the end ""Tommy"" looked stupid.

2043585,5,B0001Z3HWC,"dean cain did a good job, i thought it could of been better, but the points and details were pretty much key and some parts lacked..but over all it was pretty good",1152662400,,163,4.125
2043586,4,B0001Z3HWC,"My curiosity and heightening interest in the Laci Peterson case finally compelled me to rent this film. Having become heavily focused on all aspects of the case from the time I read Sharon Rocha's recent heart-tugger ""For Laci,"" I was very interested in seeing the film that was formulated and inspired by Amber Frey's quickly released book ""Witness.""

My opinions on the performance of Dean Cain clearly will not differ from those of anyone else's on this site; he did a remarkable job at hitting it right on the nail. His eyes, his mannerisms, his behavior...it was all amazingly on target. In his interviews and conversations with others about Laci, Scott Peterson has been known for using ""uh"" and ""um"" more than actual words from the English language in order to bridge the gap between concocting his lies and actually saying them. The way he has stared into space and babbled aimlessly to the extent that he sometimes actually forgot the question he was initially asked speaks volumes in itself, and Dean Cain did a perfect job at re-enacting that.

As for the film focusing predominantly on Scott, his behavior and his two ""composite"" friends Tommy and Kate, I think what we have to understand here is that this movie was made just as Scott was arrested and taken to trial. That was a point in the case where everything started crashing down, and of course everyone wanted to get as much emphasis as they could on how Scott Peterson was reacting to everything surrounding his wife's disappearance, as well as the discovery of Laci and Conner's bodies. At that time, everyone really needed and wanted to see what Scott's present role was in all of this, and I think that was the portrait this movie tried to convey.

Granted, the movie was made much too early, but such is to be expected with cases like this--people are always eager to spawn a TV movie as quickly as possible. The scenes were choppy and seemed to end really abruptly. It was a quick-paced, 86-minute TV film that lacked emotion and close examination of Laci's family and friends, who deserve to have their perspective acknowledged.

All in all, though, it was a good enough film for what it was: a quick, informative story that wanted to lay out some facts and shed some light on Scott's overall demeanor. Even if some of the information was a bit scattered and wayward, they did a good job at zooming in on Scott and revisiting some of the word-to-word conversations that he had with police, Amber, friends, and members of Laci's family.

It is a truly gripping story, unforgettable and worthy of a fuller portrait (similar to the book that Laci's mother Sharon wrote earlier this year). Given a few more years (or maybe a lot more years), I think this will make a terrific movie, providing more complete details and a well-rounded pursuit of the feelings and emotions experienced by everyone involved. It's a case with very raw human emotions that America has really gravitated to, and it is really a startling moment from history that people will remember for decades to come. A future movie could include areas about Scott and Laci's courtship, marriage, and life before December 24, 2002. So much has been documented about Scott, his mistress Amber Frey, and the charges he has faced, but it would be nice to get even more on sweet Laci--the innocent victim who was mere weeks away from delivering her first child when an indescribable crime took it all away from her. Discussing all these details would surely make an excellent film that I would watch without hesitation, and I have no doubt that it will eventually happen.",1149638400,10,3603,4.7584
2043587,2,B0001Z3HWC,"PERFECT HUSBAND is a watchable film, but far from perfect.  It just moves too slowly for its own good.  Add the annoying best friend who refused to believe anything bad about Scott Peterson and this made it a reasonably difficult 84 minutes to sit through.

Those criticisms aside, Dean Cain was quite good in his role as Scott, as was the grieving Dee Wallace as Laci's mother.  However at the end of the day, why does a movie like this get made when this sort of thing goes on all the time every day of the week across the world.  Was there something particular about these cirumstances that warranted a film?  I ask this because the script for the film was not written well enough to pull the viewer in. Not enough information was presented to the viewer to help us form an opinion.",1137888000,2,785,4.416666666666667
2043588,1,B0001Z3HWC,"I don't consider myself an authority on film or knowledgeable about techniques specific to filmmaking, but I know a bad movie when I see one.

USA Network's presentation of ""The Perfect Husband..."" (I won't even include the subtitle, since the celluloid ""reenactment,"" doesn't deserve to carry the name of the victim) was as transparent and unsubstantial as a snack cup of cherry Jell-O, and less palatable.

Viewers who tuned in to ""The Perfect Husband"" to learn about the Laci Peterson murder would have been far better off reading the newspaper archives or even true crime message boards. An uninformed viewer will come away from this movie with numerous erroneous details, yawning gaps in the evidence against Peterson, blatant misrepresentation of his behavior, and serious doubts about the investigative techniques and motives of the Modesto Police.

At least USA Network took no prisoners; across the board they insulted the victim's memory, her family, friends, the accused, his family, the police, and those of us with more than a passing acquaintance with the case. Besides missing the mark by miles in their attempt to depict a remotely accurate rehashing of the actual events, the movie fails miserably in most other elements of dramatic credibility as well: character development, acting, cinematography (I apply that term loosely), climactic epiphanies, or satisfying resolution.

Setting aside the numerous inaccuracies in the chronology of the case and other poetic license abused in this movie, the main characters in the story were barely more developed than the cardboard posters of Laci liberally exploited in a cheap and uncreative attempt to remind us of the victim. The only character with any substance, which I mainly credit to his portrayal by Dean Cain, was Peterson, who in reality is about as compelling as a doorknob and less useful.

I give Cain a lot of credit for his valiant attempt to breathe life into a personality essentially void of passion, angst, or introspection. It must have been akin to draining himself of life energy and replacing his blood with ice water. Cain plays Peterson better than Peterson. Perhaps they should have swapped them out for the trial.

The rest of the cast, with the exception of composite friends ""Tommy"" and ""Kate,"" are little more than props with a few insipid lines mostly drawn verbatim from news conferences, and any original dialogue which sounds as if it was penned on the back of a take-out menu while sitting in rush hour.

However, even ""Tommy"" and ""Kate"" eventually snip the thin strand of credibility in the breakfast scene. Before Scott is arrested, when Tommy pours hot water out of a teapot, never puts a tea bag or instant coffee in it, and Kate whips up some eggs, puts them on the stove, and walks away to the sink. Three minutes later nothing is burning and Tommy has yet to sip out of his mug of hot water. It is scenes like these, with careless incontinuity, that sinks this movie like the notably unmentioned concrete anchors to the depths of poor filmmaking.

""The Perfect Husband"" not only neglects to engage or entertain the audience with its dismal deficiencies, but it also fails to stand on its own merit as adequate storytelling.",1134432000,3,3227,4.996275605214152
8018498,1,B0001Z3HWC,"I tried to watch this, but it's really terrible. But not only that---13 minutes in, they make a big deal of the smell of bleach in the house.  Two separate times in that first 13 minutes.  So you just *know* he's guilty....the problem is..that wasn't true.  The officer who responded testified to that months before this was released.

And also---this was released several months before the trial.  This is the exact kind of thing that taints juries.  It's a fictional movie about a real court case that had not yet begun....reporting incorrect evidence.  There is actually a lot of evidence that goes to innocence.
In any case, appetite for the spectacle of this trial was surely primed by this fictional program.  It aims to show how he is guilty, false evidence included.
Don't bother with it if you want to really learn about the Peterson case. Finally there is a program that covers the defense case. It's produced by A & E and is a six part documentary called The Murder of Laci Peterson.",1508716800,,994,4.672413793103448
