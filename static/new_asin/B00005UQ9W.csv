1667096,5,B00005UQ9W,"I saw 13 Ghosts yesterday. I knew it was from the producers of House On Haunted Hill so I figured it would be very good and have some awesome special effects. I was right!!
The movie is about a guy who lost his wife and basicly everything he owned in a fire. He,his kis,and the nanny now live in a small apartment and hate it. One day the guy's lawer comes and shows the guy hat everything is going to change forhim and his family and that they have just inheritehis late uncle's house. So they go to check out this place and there is a guy there who claims he is an electrition,but he is actually a psycic. When they get in this house they think it is all amazing and that nothing is wrong with it,until they are informed by the psycic that the pace is haunted by some very angry ghosts.
The movie is flat out awesome. It has some amazing special effects and some pretty scary ghosts. It has some very cting from the entire cast(including Shannon Elizabeth and Mathew Lilard).
It's a great treat for all fans of ghost stories.",1004227200,6,1027,4.271794871794872
1667097,3,B00005UQ9W,"Being a lover of horror movies and a backer of the always good Tony Shalhoub, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  Based on the classic William Castle horror movie, I was kind of impressed that they didn't make this one stink, as remakes usually do.  However, plot and logic go flying out the window and the film turns to mush a little way into the flick.
The plot is centralized around a pretty interesting premise that a group of trapped ghosts can give a man total power of the future.  I can't really say more, cause it could possibly ruin part of the movie, but going off of what I've said, it's pretty clear that this would be an easy idea to screw up.
After a pretty cool opening twenty minutes, the film turns into your basic, run of the mill horror films with stupid characters doing stupid things, like running the wrong way constantly, splitting up, etc.  It seems like horror movies nowadays are just content with having scary things jumping out from behind pillars, corners, and whatever else they can hide behind.  The neat thing about this is that sometimes the scary things don't have to hide at all.
As in most modern horror movies, the make-up and production values are incredible.  The gory makeup is pretty shocking and the house that is the central figure in the movie is really neat looking.  But the direction seems to squander this with quick cuts and odd camera angles, that instead of creating a sense of tension, as they were meant to do, only make you mad.  Clear shots of the ghosts are never seen, as apparently director Steve Beck decided it would be scarier to never truly see a lot of them clearly.
The acting in the movie is pretty good, and Shalhoub doesn't dissapoint.  Matthew Lillard is given some great lines to work with, and he actually does a credible job while continuing to spew saliva all over everyone else.  The rest of the cast is pretty much wasted, but this isn't a drama so you can deal with it.
Sometimes the logic in the film slips to a point where you want to stand up and shout out how stupid it is, but the death scenes are relatively well done.  The first major death scene is a doosey that'll make your girlfriend cringe.
Overall, this is an entertaining popcorn Halloween horror movie, and that's all it was intended to be.  Even though you might be disappointed in a few aspects of what happens throughout the short hour and a half running time, you'll still feel pretty satisfied when it's all over.  THIR13EN GHOSTS is the film equivalent of eating CiCi's Pizza.  It's filling for a while, but give it some time and you'll feel hungry again.",1004140800,4,2611,4.515923566878981
1667098,5,B00005UQ9W,"I have not seen the original ""13 Ghosts"", but I love the remake.
I saw ""13 Ghosts"" yesterday and I thought it was one of the best ghost/haunted house movies ever, it's up with ""The Frighteners"" and ""House on haunted hill(1999)"". This is the second film by ""Dark Castle"". I really liked their first two films, and I eagerly await a third shall it be made. ""13 Ghosts"" has pretty much the same plot as the original. The film starts out at a junkyard, where a team of ""ghosthunters"" are hunting for the 12th ghost. So, after a massacre of the ghosthunters, they get the 12th ghost. Then we go to the present day where a widower has just inherited a house from his late uncle. The widower (Tony Shaloub) and his family go to the house and are sealed inside.
And one by one the ghosts are released.
The visual effects are just amazing, and I liked Mathew Lillard, I felt he did a good job as the psychic ""ghosthunter"".
""13 Ghosts"" is a very scary film. If you like haunted house or ghost films, then you will love this.",1004140800,,1014,4.31413612565445
1667099,3,B00005UQ9W,"What 13 ghosts lacks in plot, it makes up for in eerie images, scary ghosts, and creative death sequences.  Matthew Lillard (from SCREAM), plays a man who gets bad headaches whenever he comes near anything dead.  Which is why F. Murray Abraham uses him to capture ghosts.  Why is he capturing ghosts?  Who knows?  Who cares?  With chills aplenty, this film quickly loses its thin plotline and lets the ghosts run amuck.  (THANK GOD)  Even when we find out the point of capturing the ghosts, we don't care because it sounds so stupid.  There are a couple of plot twists that make this average horror movie try to attain something more, that only sometime succeed. If you like gory visual effects you should like this, but don't look for a plot.  An enjoyable visual ride just perfect for Halloween.  If it came out at any other time of year, my review would be a bit more harsh.",1004054400,,877,4.522292993630574
1667170,5,B00005UQ9W,"This movie is imaginative and interesting. It has a fairly simple plot and a complicated execution. It's about a widower who learns that his uncle, who has recently passed away, has left him an inheritance of a very high-tech house set in the woods. The widower, his family and their nanny move into their new home which is filled with beautiful belongings and gadgets from around the world. They soon discover its not a house but a complex, fine tuned machine with latin phrases etched in walls of glass that , on a timer, move and shift, trapping the residents in rooms that each hold one of the thirteen ghosts that they see only with special glasses. The residents then try avoid them at all costs.  It's a high-tech ghost story unlike most anything you've ever watched. If there are any weak spots in this movie ...you'll forget them soon after they present themselves. However there is a measure of violence, blood and gore so use discretion when watching it with others. It's one of those rare sleeper hits that needs to be part of your collection. I definitely recommend this movie !",1520726400,,1091,4.652849740932642

Overall it's not a horrible movie, it's just kinda cheesey and campy.  The effects are decent for a movie from 2001 and the cast is...meh.

I wouldn't advise anyone to watch this if they had to rent it, but if it were free and I wanted to see some cheese, go for it.

1667351,3,B00005UQ9W,"Another unnecessary remake that vaguely resembles the plot of the original film in which a family inherits a house that is filled with a dozen ghosts.  The main problem with this film is that it is noisy and frantic but not very scary.  The cast runs around a glass house that is constantly reconfiguring its interior.  Thats the plot.  They run and run and run and sometimes they scream and scream and scream.  Most of the hysteria involved is singlehandedly provided by psychic Dennis (another twitchy performance by Matthew Lillard).  Tony Shalhoub plays the poor sod who inherits the dubious house.  His performance helps bring down the energy as he fluctuates indecisively in tone and demeanor, at times appearing so disinterested that you wonder if he was belatedly reconsidering his film choice as he was working at not working.  F. Murray Abrahams does what he is known for, playing bombastic one-note villains.  If youve seen one, youve seen them all.

But the house is cool.  And the ghosts are very artful.  Its entertaining enough (even though it ended up on Roger Eberts list of most hated films).",1478476800,2,1110,4.877005347593583

The movie was great and the effects were stellar but don't listen to the critics. Listen to me. Thir13en Ghosts has more of a dramatic charm behind the gory exterior that horror fans love. The film has a lot of tense and gruesome scenes that gave me goosebumps at first but the main subject just by gore alone: was family values and heartbreak. The film had a funny scene at the end which became my favorite out of the movie but i'm not going into detail about that because: SPOILER ALERT!!! With that aside, I think Thir13en Ghosts is more of a drama than a gory horror film.",1475798400,,689,4.149253731343284

Not really scary at all.. But I'm desensitized from all of the horror I watch and it's very hard to scare me. Some parts of the movie don't work..

I love horror 80's style thru today (2016) and the special FX only have gotten better. But, with Thirteen Ghosts (this version), the special effects are awesome! Synopsis: When Cyrus Kriticos, a very rich collector of unique things dies, he leaves it all to his nephew and his family. All including his house, his fortune, and his malicious collection of ghosts!
So as for watching this - YES! He%% YES. Should you watch it with your child? Well I did, but I raised my child on horror movies explaining that they weren't real, showing her the same characters that died in one movie were alive and well in another, and I watched a special effects documentary with her about horror makeup - best I could do I felt. She slept with me for many years...Say what you will, that's how this family rolls. So make your own mind up about who you watch this with, but let me just say that the monsters (ghosts) in this movie are SCARY!",1460937600,,1030,4.426315789473684

1667675,5,B00005UQ9W,"Don't get me wrong. I love independent horror, low-budget horror, sketchy, arty, weird horror. But when Hollywood throws some serious money at a really solid idea for a screamer, it's a beautiful thing. Tony Shaloub! Damn. With a handful of exceptions, I haven't regularly watched any TV shows for about 25 years, so I basically missed Monk, but after seeing this I'm sure I would have loved it. And the rest of the cast is excellent, too. My complaint was not enough Shannon Elizabeth. My impression was always that this was supposed to be her big try at proving she could act without taking her clothes off. Well, her clothes do get ripped off her (not that I'm complaining) but for most of the movie she's just being held captive in a big rotating death machine. Maybe she couldn't act after all...although my guess is that she just wasn't very good at playing the Hollywood game.",1411776000,,883,4.666666666666667

1667678,5,B00005UQ9W,"When it comes to this film, some people find it decent. Others, like Roger Ebert, simply loathed it. I, on the other hand, found it pretty decent and still worthwhile. In this film, poor Arthur Kriticos can't catch a lucky break after his wife died in a fire. He and his kids are being evicted from one residence after another. He has nothing set aside for his kids and he's struggling to make end meet. One day, along comes the lawyer for his uncle, Cyrus, with news of his uncle's untimely death and announcement that he, his kids, and their jive-talking babysitter/nanny have inherited his house with rooms galore and separate bathrooms each, a fact which pleases Arthur's daughter, Kathy, to no end. However, upon arrival, they are joined by Dennis Rafkin, who used to work for Cyrus and wants the fair share of money that Cyrus promised him, as well as by Kalina Ortezia, a well-known individual in the spirit reclamation business who's had more than one encounter with Cyrus and is trying to free all the trapped spirits he captured. As it turns out, upon getting locked inside the house, discoveries about the house are made, a death or two is committed, the kids disappear, and Arthur will have to discover how far he'll go to keep his family safe. It may not be perfect but it's certainly a lot better than some of the films the production company behind this film made.",1410048000,3,1379,4.63265306122449

The uncle leaves the house, along with a basement full of ghosts, to his nephew.

1667728,4,B00005UQ9W,"13 Ghosts(released Oct/01)stars,among others,Tony Shalhoub,Matthew Lillard,Embeth Davidtz and Murray F.Abraham. This is a remake of the Castle 1960 version. House on Haunted Hill,another Castle film,was also remade but compared to this,I thought it weak. This one does not start out as strong as it could have,but once the action focuses in on the house,it really takes off.
The story opens as an eccentric Abraham,is trying to capture a ghost in a wreckers yard,of all places,with his psychic assistant Lillard. They end up with their prey but at a high cost of lives,including Abraham's. The scene next switches to widower Shaloub,who lives with his two children and nanny. They get notified that Shaloub's uncle,Abraham,has died and he has inherited his mansion. They drive out and it is a spectacular looking affair,filled with glass panels throughout,and all with Latin writing and symbols emblazoned on them. As the lawyer familiarizes them with their new home,a knock on the door reveals Lillard. He comes under a guise which is short lived,and he informs them all of the ghosts that live in the various paneled rooms of the house. The lawyer activates a switch which seals the house and starts the familie's ""adventures"".
Shaloub's young son gets away from his nanny and he is the first to encounter a ghost. Slowly but surely the rest end up  wearing special glasses that enable then to clearly see the ghosts. All of the spirits have names and apparently,according to Lillard,the Jackal has been released and they are all in grave danger. The house periodically shifts due to a giant mechanism within its center,and panels that at one moment are open,now close,and visa versa. This unleashes new ghost after new ghost. The family searches for Shaloub's son but instead end up finding Abraham,still alive. They learn that he has both of Shaloub's children hostage,and that in order to save them he must sacrifice himself to become the 13th ghost.
Shaloub enters a room with deadly rotating rings which surround his children at regular intervals. Standing in a circle around the mechanism are the 12 ghosts of the house. Shaloub manages to safely jump to his kids in safety while the machine,with the help of the nanny,comes flying apart. The ghosts are all released from bondage and Shaloub's long deceased wife,who was one of the ghosts,appears and tells them she loves them.
The opening for the film in the auto wreckers yard,fell back on your traditional kind of gore for gore's sake....just shock value. However,the film gets smart as the scene switches to Shaloub and his family and their visit to his uncle's home. From then on it becomes a really scary affair as these different ghosts,of all shapes and types,begin to appear one after the other,some becoming super deadly. The S/FX are excellent and add to the eery atmosphere. Shaloub does a good job going from the typical and loving father,skeptical of Lillard's words,until finally reluctantly believing what he sees. Actually a good job is done by all.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,tricky excess club reel,a featurette,a look at all the ghosts and enhanced content.
All in all a very decent scary film,with a solid and believable cast. The film starts off weakly but gains considerable ground thereafter. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1382400000,,3370,5.050269299820466

1667733,3,B00005UQ9W,"Some people seem to get a break in the face of tragedy, yet it seems to somehow go to hell anyway. In another release from Dark Castle illustrating that yes, life can and does suck, Arthur Kritico's on the edge trying to raise his two children after the death of his wife. Fate seems to feel badly for the poor guy, though, for soon afterwards a lawyer pops up on the widow's doorstep, telling him that his dear ol uncle has passed on and left him a mansion in his will. Naturally the family sees a better opportunity and moves in, annoying nanny in tow, only to find out that Uncle Cyrus wasn't the nicest kind of guy after all. He happened to be the kind that traps ghosts within glass walls of their new residence.

When arriving the family is clearly and naturally baffled by the glass walls, the strange latin like scribblings, and the strange psychic they encounter. They soon discover their house has been triggered to open and spit out creepy ghosts at them...and that the machine was built by a madman determined to be filled with power through a pact with the devil himself. Since the houses mazes keep changing, it becomes locked, with children Kathy and Bobby lost inside. It's up to the adults to play a little game of 'rescue', but will they find the kids and all get to safety in time?

Yes, the plot does sound cleverly wicked and almost 'cool', but sadly it disappointed me on so many levels it was nearly coma-inducing. I like to think of 13 ghosts as a failed opportunity that wasn't meant to be - with it's plot, it shouldn't have been overly difficult to create a film chocked full of eerie moments, trippy sequences, a rapid pace and a mind-bending plot that stood at as glaringly unique. What we ended with instead was something that's nice and shiny on the outside but pointless in the middle, kind of like being excited about a brightly wrapped Christmas present under the tree, only to find out there's only tacky clothes inside once opened. While the story itself sounds dazzling from description alone and the special effects are spectacular on some aspects, once it's peeled open you find out that once again you have been fooled by the glittery paper, gigantic dollar store bow and frilly ribbons.

Before I start letting all the bad stuff out in the open, I'll concentrate on existing benefits first. One thing the flick did excel at was the creepy as hell ghosts. They weren't lax on the FX and makeup, and the spirits were menacing as hell and pure evil incarnate. One of my particular favorites was the dead princess - nude in all her glory, splattered with enough blood to make Carrie feel left out at the prom. They also dispensed with a few humans in semi-creative ways (The glass cutting scene anyone?) I know if I encountered one of these I'd drop dead of fight fast enough to make someone's head spin.

The second thing that helped me wash down this bitter pill was the mediocre to sometimes good suspense built up at occasional opportune times. I loved the part of the teenager daughter, Kathy, in the bathroom with the prom queen from hell behind her in the mirror. Stuff like this almost made me enjoy the movies; it's just a shame that something with such easy potential fell so hard on its face. But hey, maybe that's what happens when you try to remake a William Castle flick?

On the bad side of the table (and this takes up most of the room), the characters are generally despisable. The little ploy, played by Alec Roberts, tended to get on ones' nerves; seeing him get bitch slapped would have been comical and welcome relief. His sister, played by Shannon Elisabeth, did well enough but her character wasn't anything worth praising. I didn't latch on to her and didn't give a s*** what happened to her. Moving along...Matthew Lillard is  usually someone I can't stand, especially in Scream, but here he actually pulls his own weight and floats farther than most of the others. His dialogue was humorous and at least if Hollywood chose to exploit the comic card yet again, they did a decent job this time. Other dialogue, though, needed some tuning up. The nanny's character was unneeded, the family needed live-in help before moving to the mansion?? - and she irritated me to no end.

Even though characterization sticks out like a hammered thumb, it wasn't even the main issue. The plot was. It held more holes than a large chunk of Swiss. It was obviously put together just to show off some nifty ghosts, quick deaths and cheap horror gimmicks. 13 Ghosts suffers from what many 90s and above films do - a chance to show off 'cool' effects and think it is enough to dazzle the audience into submission. They had to figure out a way somehow for the plot to 'fit' it . The ending didn't make much sense either and most of the movie, once played back, was paper thin.

Yes, 13 Ghosts offers some superficial chills, fun jump scares, but nothing deep and nothing consistent. If you want a ghost story with an actual 'story' (God forbid), head in the other direction - fast! Watch this one only if you don't mind obvious plots for stereotyped audiences in order for Hollywood to cash in on yet another buck.",1379635200,,5154,4.564324324324324

1667736,4,B00005UQ9W,"Quite an array of twists and turns are offered in the house built to quarter the Ghosts of the story. The technical devices do more than update the old haunted house, it makes it into a 13th and most significant player. For the most part, despite the ghastly ghost appearance of the apparitions, they are remarkably well behaved, in the sense that the Director spares us gushing blood, smashed faces, visual decapitations, and the like,  making the Ghosts only nasty killers by implication. (Yes, there is blood and a child caught up in the melee, so parents will have to give thought as to what lower age limit to place on the kids). Tony Shalhoub, as the widower father with two children, does his usual effective job while the rest of the cast admirably supports. Certainly, this can be recommended as one of the better and more watchable horror films of the day.",1377475200,,866,4.660130718954249

1667774,4,B00005UQ9W,"A team of ghost hunters enter a junk yard on a mission to capture a ghost named Juggernaut.  They set up special equipment and arrange the team to drive the spirit where they want him.  They use a psychic to locate the ghost and discover he has killed 40 victims at the junk yard.  They spray the wrecks with blood to draw the ghost into the ""Cube"".  Several men are killed and the ghost is in full murderous power but he is finally trapped in the Cube.

Even Cyrus Kriticos, the leader of the ghost hunting team, is killed in the fight.  His entire estate is left to his nephew whose family just lost their home to a fire and the mother was also killed in the fire.  Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub) decides to move his family into his uncle's mansion when he inherits it as well as his uncle's remaining wealth.  The home is made up with a lot of glass walls and floors and they are scripted with Latin.  The home is the prison to 12 evil ghosts and it is a mechanism to open the eye of hell......

The special effects of this movie are very good and the house is a masterpiece of design and architecture.  It is simply beautiful and it is a work of art.  Unfortunately the lawyer who took them to the home and the power company worker there to check the power are really working together to get money out of the home.  The power company worker is the young psychic who was at the junkyard. The lawyer while stealing some money inadvertently trips a level and that releases the evil ghosts.  The house is now in motion and begins changing shape and structure.

This movie has a lot of gruesome special effects and they are done very well.  The ghosts and the home are some of the best movie special effects you will see.  The story line is ok but the characters are over the top and this keeps the movie form being a 5 star rating but I still give it 4 stars for the great effects and concept.

This move is macabre and contains a lot of blood and some nudity.  This is just a word of caution if you don't care for that style of movie content.",1346803200,2,2044,4.208226221079691

It's telling when an R-rated movie introduces 2 (vapid and annoying, this is no POLTERGEIST) child characters and then conveniently gets rid of them for most of the middle of the story. The kids act as though they are in a G-rated movie, and, similarly, bumbling Tony Shaloub seems to think he's in Disney's HAUNTED MANSION and not an R-rated scare-fest. And there's a PLETHORA of plot-holes which, unlike the doorways of the house in the story, never close, even temporarily. I can ignore ""off"" aspects if the rest of a movie really works but here it's all just too distracting and confusing to turn a blind eye to. Yes, the house is interesting, but it, and the ghosts, quickly become little more than video-game-type obstacles. For the gore-fan, though, there are one or 2 neat ""kills"". One in particular is astoundingly horrible and well-executed. Much obvious care was put into the sets, and I've gotta applaud the minimal use of CGI. However, I don't care about the characters or miss them when they're gone. Plot/motivation revelations in the final quarter are ridiculous and absolutely impossible to swallow.

1667782,1,B00005UQ9W,"With great pacing, an incredible plot, and clever, well-thought dialogue, you would think this movie would be very good. But somehow, it never quite comes together. I think it comes down to the odd casting choices.

The film is a pseudo-documentary revolving around the great actor and country music legend, Billy Ray Cyrus, played by F. Murray Abraham. This itself was an eyebrow-raising decision, but I went along with it. Until about midway through, where F. Murray breaks out into ""Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart."" I'm sorry, but the movie lost me right there.

The movie also had Antonio from ""Wings"", being moody a lot. Very moodful. Other members of the cast included a hotter, sexier version of Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", starring as a vampire killer / ghost hunter, something like that... Heck, I don't know. All I know is she was really hot. And when she met her fateful end ***WARNING: JUST DID A SPOILER, SORRY*** I was very sad to see it.

The deadbeat dad - I mean downbeat dad - had two offspring on the show. One was your regular superhot supermodel daughter, which of course, most families have at least one of. She was very enthusiastic over the new house. Way more enthusiastic than the creepy situation warranted, IMAO. The other was the annoying little kid, which is pretty much required in this type of movie. His main job was to get lost and/or into trouble all the time. The kid also had an extreme obsession with death, which again, is a personality quirk that is very typical of most 8 year olds.

The film also had the great actor Creepy Lawyer Guy, starring as ""Creepy Lawyer Guy"". It also featured a goofy sidekick, for comic relief. Who also happened to be psychic. Wow, a silly psychic sidekick! Now say that five times fast.

Last but by no means least, the film starred some random black woman, fulfilling the role of ""Generic Stereotypical Black Woman"". Later in the movie, she even does the patented ""Black Woman Freak Out"", complete with raising her hands in the air and muttering to herself about ""all these crazy white folks"". I think this was intended to be very funny. Intended to be. I think.

As for scariness, pretty much the scariest thing in the movie was the Menacing CGI gears. Which spun... A lot. And rotated... A lot. And then did it again! Oooh. It would have been more scary perhaps if Miley Cyrus had showed up, but that never happened. (In hindsight, maybe that's okay. She is pretty scary all on her own.)

Oh, there was one other thing that was supposed to be pretty scary, and that was a cut-up woman ghost. But the scariness factor was kind of lost on me, because I kept pausing it to look at her boobs. (Thank God for Blu-ray and HD.) I mean seriously, that ghost had a great rack. But I had to wonder how real they were, because all the cuts would have to indicate some rubber latex bodysuit or something. So in the end, disappointment.

As far as plot goes (as if you care), all of the ghost-busting shenanigans center around unleashing the ""Ocularist Infernum"", or ""Eye of Hell"". I take it this is a bad thing. The movie never really says. Which is a bit frustrating, because it explains everything else. In endless, coma-inducing detail... But I guess it's safe to assume that this grisly fate - should it come to pass - would result in a massive outbreak of red, itchy eyes. Which would be good for eyedrop sales, but bad for mankind in general. Especially in parts of the world where they can't afford eyedrops.

So in the end, great movie! Take your wife, take your kids. Especially if they've never seen a black person, so you can show them how black people act in real life. (Those darn black people! They just crack me up.) But seriously, if you're not into country music, this movie may not be your thing.",1306713600,,3807,4.570381231671554

1667794,2,B00005UQ9W,"A remake of William Castle's 13 Ghosts from 1960, this new version differs considerably from the first. Arthur Kriticos, gentle math teacher, is the nephew of a evil scientist named Cyrus Kriticos. Arthur is mourning the loss of his wife and all their belongings when Cyrus dies and leaves him a bizarre house of glass. Inside are trapped 12 ghosts; angry and demented, they'll attack anyone who comes near. Arthur and his remaining family becomes trapped in the house with their housekeeper and a ghost hunter who helped build the house. With the help of special glasses that allow them to see the ghosts, and a handful of spells, they must evade the ghosts and find a way out before one of them becomes the 13th ghost! An ""almost"" movie that could have been good if the house had not become the star of the show.

The house. It is a bizarre cube of glass and gears that ticks around like a clockwork. Strange inscriptions are engraved in the glass walls. At the house the family also meets a ghost hunter, Joshua Rafkin, [Adam Kaminsky] who helped to build it. The cube, we learn almost immediately through some quick exposition by Joshua, is actually a containment device holding 12 ghosts--11 who are extremely angry and quite demented, and 1 who is well known to the family: their wife and mother. The ghosts are held back by the spells on the walls, and are kept locked in the basement of the house. But as it ticks around, they are freed, one by one.

Each ghost is a masterpiece of special effects; Gregory Nicotero has done his usual amazing job. And the use of the spells and other devices, including glasses that allow the wearer to see the ghosts, allows director Steve Beck to pull off some cute scenes. There are scenes in which only one person present can see the ghost and mayhem ensues, scenes using the containment spells as a shield. But after 10 minutes or so, you've seen the whole movie. Because the plot never really develops, nor do the characters. It's like watching someone play a video game--there's a goal, because games have to have goals, but no deep reason, and watching someone else play gets tiresome after a while.

13 Ghosts is probably worth seeing for the effects, but if you watch the middle third of the movie, you'll get everything you can out of it, and maybe your money's worth, if its a rental.",1285286400,,2337,4.586124401913875

It's funny to me when people try and describe the plot, like it matters.  ""The film is about a struggling family who inherits a strange...yada-yada-yada.""  Seriously, this film doesn't deserve a synopsis.  I once wrote a review detailing 13 reasons to turn this movie off and I stand by every one of them.  This movie is annoying, it isn't scary, it is STUPID (yes, with all capital letters), the acting is atrocious and Shannon Elizabeth keeps her top on.  The house, I digress, is kind of cool (conceptually) but the gimmick wares out its welcome when it has nothing of substantial weight to back it up.  The ghosts are more clichd and ridiculous than actually scary and the comical overtones to this film make it appear more of a campy D-grade `straight to DVD' type film with absolutely no real redeeming factors.  Matthew Lillard sets a new standard for bad acting with his over-the-top theatrics (I'm so glad he never really turned into a big star).  With one of the worst opening scenes I've ever seen put to film, this trashy remake of a 60's film I've never seen remains a skid mark on my cinematic viewing pleasure.",1278374400,2,1321,4.655172413793103

1667803,3,B00005UQ9W,"Considering this is a remake of the William Castle ""gimmick"" b-movie, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" is more entertaining than it should be, but not a good as it could have been.

What I mean to say is that while I love the William Castle original film, Castle's version was more of a comedy with a nifty 3-D gimmick thrown in. The basic story of a family inheriting a haunted mansion was pure sitcom at best. And while there are some chills sprinkled through the original film, the humor is what I remember most about the film.

The remake does away with all of the humor and attempts to go for the jugular as a pure horror film. The basic storyline remains the same in that a family inherits a haunted house from a ghost hunting uncle. And like the original, 12 spirits inhabit the house...so who is the thirteenth ghost? You have to watch to find out.

Tony Shalhoub turns in a solid performance as Arthur Kriticos, the widower and family man who inherits the haunted home from his uncle. Shalhoub was only 1 year away from striking gold with his TV show ""Monk"" when this film came out, and I find it difficult watching ""Thirteen Ghosts"" now, and not thinking of the Monk character obsessing about fingerprints all over the glass house?!?! The rest of the cast is solid as well, with F. Murray Abraham chewing up scenes as the ghost hunting uncle and Matthew Lillard still hunting ghosts here in his pre-Shaggy days.

The special effects are pretty good, and the make-up for the various ghosts looks great. The glass house featured in the film is pretty inventive, and adds a nice touch of atmosphere. There are a few bumps and jumps that will jolt you out of your seat sprinkled throughout the film, but there is nothing in the movie that will stick with you past the end credits.

If you enjoyed the remake of ""The House on Haunted Hill"", then you will probably enjoy this film as well. If you are looking for a spooky ghost story along the lines of ""The Changeling"", you will probably be disappointed.",1257120000,5,1994,4.527777777777778

1667805,2,B00005UQ9W,"Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos (F.Murray Abraham) is on a mission to capture the souls of 13 ghosts so that he can unleash a hellish power on Earth. With the assistance of a psychic named Dennis (Matthew Lillard), Cyrus catches 12 souls before being killed on a hunt. Cyrus's nephew Arthur (Tony Shaloub) is a widower with two kids (Shannon Elizabeth plays the oldest) and a housekeeper (Rah Digga) to support. In financial trouble and in risk of being evicted from his apartment Arthur gets some much needed relief when a lawyer representing Cyrus's estate shows up at his door.  He informs Arthur that he is the inheritor of his uncle's mansion. The mansion is a spectacular structure made out of glass that Arthur and his family are all too eager to move into. The only problem is that they also inherit the 12 souls that Cyrus captured. Dennis is also there looking for the money Cyrus owed him and together he and Arthur learn that there is a 13th ghost and only Arthur can catch him. This is the second Dark Castle (a film company created by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis that re-imagines the 50's and 60's horror films of director William Castle for modern audiences) film after 'House On Haunted Hill'. Both films start off very promising establishing a creepy vibe and the promise of genuine scares  before tripping over complicated plot twists that cause the film to be boring and not frightening. This film starts off great beginning in an abandoned junkyard then moving to Arthur's claustrophobic apartment before finally settling in the mansion. There are some wonderfully ominous shots in the beginning but eventually overt gore wins out over any subtlety. The ghosts are definitely disturbing and horrific but they weren't utilized like they should have been. The explanation as to why Arthur is the only man capable of capturing the last ghost is a nice touch and at least provides one unexpected surprise. Shannon Elizabeth factors in the beginning but is absent during the middle act only to reappear in the film's final act. This lets Matthew Lillard, from 'Scream', steal the show. He sells every scene he's in with hyper energy and some good physical comedy. It's a disappointing horror film because it looks like it's going to be fun and scary but is actually little more than a standard gorefest.",1254355200,,2318,4.836272040302267

1667837,3,B00005UQ9W,"So he already destroyed one of the greatest haunted house movies of all time ""House on Haunted Hill"". I was already upset that once again Steve Beck (The Director) was remaking another movie. How about we come up with something new here. Well needless to say I went into this film with no expectations what so ever, which turned out to be a good thing.

The best scene of the film comes right at the beginning (So wait to get your popcorn until later into the film, just don't miss the opening) We begin in a Junkyard full of dangerous looking metal and sharply twisted vehicles. Here we meet Matthew Lillard as Rafkin (I know most of you hate him but I find him quite funny) a pill popping psychic who is one step from losing his last grasp of reality. He steps is in this god forsaken junkyard with F. Murray Abraham (Uncle Cyrus) an instantly dislikable character (Which means he's the bad guy) and about 50 other random people in bio suits. After the opening scene (which ii quite bloody and rather interesting) We discover that they are a bunch of Ghost Trappers and this is the 12th ghost they have trapped in one of these lovely glass boxes with writing all over it.

End of really cool beginning (Go get popcorn now)

Now we segue into a family scene, Tony Shalhaub plays Arthur the loving father of two, Shannon Elizabeth as Kathy, and Alec Roberts as Bobby. They are a poor family that has lost their mother. They have creditors calling but amazingly can afford to pay Maggie (Rah Digga the token ethnic woman in the movie) to be the nanny that doesn't seem to do anything.

Well to sum up and not give too much away, they suddenly find out that they have inherited this huge house made entirely of glass (covered in the same writings as the ghost catcher in the first scene). Once the go in, surprise surprise they get locked in along with Lillard who posed as an electrician and Kalina (the token exposition character ""Oh your confused, let me pull out my handy book that explains the whole movie and sum up a few passages for you"")

That's all of the story I'll go into. Now for my opinion of the movie:

This is a tough one, the acting was flat, especially on the part of the family. Lillard gave his best ""I'm losing it"" attempt but the whole cast seemed to walk tiredly through the script. No one except Lillard seemed overly concerned with the fact that they could all be killed at any moment, and even he gave in at the promise of money.

I have to admit, that this movie did entertain me... I was refreshed at the fact that the ghosts were made with makeup and not computer generated. The sets were brilliant and actually seemed to be the star of the film. The make up crew did go a little overboard with the ghost costumes, the one which is supposed to be a naked woman looked less real than a blow up doll. There was just way too much overzealousness to create ""Scary"" that made it look more campy than frightening.

The storyline was filled with glaring plot holes and the infamous ""this is supposed to shock you"" plot twist that you will see coming from the first scene. The tension is built around the fact that the ghosts can only be seen through these special glasses that for some reason there is only enough for one person in the group to ever see the ghosts.

Why is the movie a full 2 hours if these people are so outmatched by these terrifyingly evil ghosts? Because apparently you can see a ghost and if you slowly back away they will leave you alone. Also unless you trip you can out run them.

Another disappointing part of the movie is the misuse of several of the ghosts who end up becoming random set pieces.

So with the bad acting, campy looking ghosts, and typical holey script, is this movie worth watching? My answer is a big fat maybe. If you are in the mood for a campy horror flick that won't scare you too bad, then rent this on video, otherwise wait until it's on TV, watch the opening scene and leave it at that.

1667840,4,B00005UQ9W,"There are often times when the local video store fails to have the latest hot release on its shelf. And as you look over what is left on the old racks, you begin to think that it makes more sense to go home and pull out an old movie to watch rather than dish out the money to rent something that night.  I found myself in that predicament the other night and after negotiating with my son we decided to pull out a horror film we hadn't watched in a while: THIR13TEN GHOSTS.

Now I barely recall seeing the original film that bore this name from the 60's. And when I saw this in the theater I wasn't sure what to expect. But being a horror fan for most of my life, I watched this film with no expectations and discovered it to be one of those great movies that offer those items that make a horror film one to remember. It had horror, it had humor, it had suspense, it had a touching portion and above all it was about fun. We watch horror films for the same reason we ride roller coasters. Not to try and stimulate a heart attack, but close to it. We watch to get our nerves a tad shaken up, to feel the dampness of sweat on our palms and to feel relief that what we have just witnessed wasn't something that WE had to go through.

The story unfolds easily. Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is a wealthy man who starts off the film attempting to capture a violent ghost with the aid of psychic Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard). During this capture, several men involved are killed as is Cyrus.

Move on to the family of Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shaloub), Cyrus' nephew, who has recently lost nearly everything in a fire, including his late wife. Living as best they can, Arthur, his two children and their nanny wake one morning to the arrival of a lawyer with a recorded message on his laptop. It seems that Cyrus has left Arthur and family his estate in his will. And off the family goes to check it out.

They arrive to find an unusual house made of glass with inscriptions on nearly every panel of glass. They also run into Dennis pretending to be an employee of the electric company. They all enter the house and are stunned by the antiquities inside as well as the sumptuousness of the house.

Dennis goes down to the basement wearing a pair of glasses that enable the bearer to see the ghosts that have been captured and imprisoned there. Not sure what Cyrus is up to, he goes upstairs to warn Arthur and to help get his family out of the house. But it's too late. Wheels, literally, are set in motion when the lawyer gets to the basement first and trips a mechanism that locks up the house and causes a large machine to start up. It also results in the death of the lawyer.

Arthur attempts to get his family together and leave but discovers that the house is now sealed. He also finds out that they didn't stay put where he told them to and is now off searching for each of them. Dennis explains who he is and what he did for Cyrus, only to Arthur's disbelief. But once in the basement witnessing the attack of one of the ghosts set free upon his daughter (Shannon Elizabeth), Arthur's viewpoint turns around.

The movie then revolves around the family's attempt to reunite and the attacks of the ghosts as they are each released periodically. As each one is turned loose, the real reason for their being gathered grows closer. And with the sudden appearance of an activist who attempts to set spirits free, Arthur, his family and Dennis discover the real meaning behind the ghosts and why they are here.

The movie offers some spectacular special effects, using the most grotesque depictions of the ghosts to full effect. They pop up out of nowhere and attack, some character being able to seem them and others not, depending on who is or isn't wearing the glasses. But the attacks are real and the results of each are as well as we see the rips and tears brought upon those attacked.

The movie offers a great background story to bring all of the pieces together and the fearful moments are done in a way that they add to that. And fright inducing is what they do. I don't suggest you watch this with your face too close to the screen.

The actors all turn in fine performances, especially Lillard as the psychic who when touched feels visions and pain. Shaloub in pre-MONK form does a great job as a loving father. The rest are not the focal point, but do a great job as well.

But more than anything, this movie is fun. And I had forgotten that since I first viewed it. It's like the ride through the spook house at the carnival, all noise and jump inducing scares, but thrilling anyway. And when the ride finishes, you feel glad that it's over but wanting to go around and get in line once more.

There are few movies that I make a point of adding to my collection with the intent of watching over and over again. This is one movie that I could do that with and be entertained each and every time.",1205366400,,4909,4.33442265795207

1667857,4,B00005UQ9W,"This is one of those movies that I know is not good, but for some reason I just can't help liking anyway.

Other reviewers have gone into the details of the plot, so in this review I will just stick to my opinions.

I don't like Tony Shalhoub, and find his usual mumbling, bumbling type acting irritating and unsuitable for the part of the father who brings his family to the strange house of glass bequeathed to them by his late brother.  The script is nothing special either.  But in spite of this, I find that there are other things about this movie that make me like it, even though I feel I should know better.

First of all there is Matthew Lillard as a psychic who is able to track ghosts.  After being the only thing about that horrible disaster of a live-action Scooby Doo movie that I liked with his great portrayal of Shaggy, I find Lillard quite likeable here too.

Next are the superb creature designs and make-up they have crafted for each of the ghosts.  I was so impressed I found myself wishing some company would make action figures for some of them.

Then there is the design of the unusual house itself.  It is visually stunning, and when I think of this movie, it is the first thing that springs to mind.  Very well done.

There is also Rah Digga as the children's African-American governess Bess.  While I would normally cringe at her stereotypical ""smart-mouthed black chick"" character who just seems calculatingly included to widen the appeal of the movie to a wider demographic, in fact Digga does a great job and pulls it off, making her character quite likeable too and successfully injecting notes of humour into the movie.

Combined with decent special effects and an overall polished look to the production, all these factors come together and manage to make this movie somehow work IN SPITE OF its bad script.  Overall I found it quite entertaining and watchable, and while it's certainly not one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, I'm still happy to have it in my collection to pull out from time to time and enjoy watching with a heaping bowl of popcorn.

1667859,4,B00005UQ9W,"""Thir13en Ghosts"" is the second movie made by Dark Castle Entertainment, who brought us the equally chilling ""House On Haunted Hill"" remake in 1999. This film is a remake of William Castle's 3-D ghost house romp. This movie opens with some real-life ""ghost hunters"" hunting ghosts in a wrecking yard, the ghost is very violent, lots of people die. We are then introduced into the Kriticos family, which consists of a father, his daughter and son, and their live-in nanny. Living in a cramped little apartment, they are happy when they inherit their uncle Arthur's glass-walled mansion after his death. Little do they know, Arthur was a ghost hunter, and the basement of the house contains sealed rooms that hold twelve assorted ghosts. When the family goes to see the house one evening, they meet a kooky electrician (who is actually a previous ghost hunter who worked for Arthur). And after entering the house, it seals shut, and begins to shift, hallways disappearing and changing, etc. Turns out this glass-walled ""house"" is a ghost machine, and as the night progresses, the ghosts below are released from their containment.

This is one of those movies that is really flashy, jumpy, and loud. It uses these qualities as scare tactics, and they actually work in this film. The ghosts in the movie were scary as hell, each of them have a bit of a backstory and a name. The ghosts that freaked me out in particular were The Pilgrimess, The Angry Princess, and The Jackal. All of them were scary in their own ways, but out of them all, those ones stood out to me. The setting for the film was great, and the whole house set was magnificent - all the walls made of glass, glass floors, etc. It looked awesome. The special effects were great, especially the makeup used on the unique ghosts, and it had plenty of startling action sequences. The acting was decent, good enough in the context of the movie. And the realtor's death was probably the best in the whole film, very original and gruesome. I liked how they incorporated the ""glasses"" theme into this movie. In the original 1960 version, you had to wear actual 3-D glasses to see the ghosts. In this movie, the characters must wear special glasses to see them.

Overall, ""Thir13en Ghosts"" is a good horror movie. It's not necessarily scary, but it's startling on many occasions and the ghosts in the movie were really creepy and unique, I've never seen ones quite like this in a horror film. Don't expect a suspenseful mystery thriller, but if you like supernatural horror movies that are jumpy and flashy, you'll enjoy this. 7/10.",1161043200,2,2586,4.7444444444444445

1667862,5,B00005UQ9W,"If you're familiar with the system Roger Ebert employs in reviewing films, you'll know that he does not just have one scale. For instance, he does not compare films like The Godfather with films like Rob Schneider's The Animal; he knows that the audiences of these films come to see them for very different reasons, and therefore they must be rated according to how they live up to the type of film they are. The Animal might not be great when compared to The Godfather, but how is it when compared to other low-brow comedies like it, like the films of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey? (Actually, The Animal stinks pretty much no matter how you rate it, unless you're only comparing it to other Schneider films).

I take the trouble of going through this, because, by most accounts, Thirteen Ghosts is not a good movie. It does poorly against The Godfather. But, Ebert is right, and Thirteen Ghosts was never written for the reasons that The Godfather was. It would be unfair to compare the two. Thirteen Ghosts is a horror movie--specifically, a B horror movie (as opposed to something like Poltergeist, The Others or The Sixth Sense) and intentionally so. It was written for fans of B horror films (and there are many; I am one). And, as a B horror film, it is a great movie.

Tony Shaloub can act, folks. He's really great. And, actually, so is Matthew Lillard. The two of them conspire to do something that rarely happens in B horror films--they create believable characters that we truly care about. The rest of the cast are servicable (yeah, Elizabeth is hot, but we don't even get any exploitative footage out of her), though the little boy is fairly weak. The special effects and setting serve to create a whole other world that we finally buy into. The ghosts, themselves, are creepy and chilling and menacing. The film creates a good, chilling mood without relying on too many of the B horror film cliches (e.g. no cats jumping out). There are a couple of twists and turns and just enough plot to allow for all of the carnage that eventually takes place.

This is not The Godfather, nor does it have to be; The Godfather is available to rent for anyone interested (and it is highly, highly recommended), but Thirteen Ghosts is good to have along side of it for those seeking other things.

1667871,5,B00005UQ9W,"Thirteen Ghosts appeared as if it would be a high tech scare fest, filled with creepy visuals, a good plotline, and lots of gore. My expectations could not have been more wrong.

 The movie chronicles the story of a small family who falls apart after the mother dies in a fire. Along with their mother, all of the family's possessions go up into flames, leaving them to be a struggling family with strong ties to one another.

 Another storyline opens up, when a psychic ghost hunter (Matthew Lillard, in one of his most poorly acted roles ever) is hired to capture ghosts for an evil man.  Of course, you can tell he is evil because his name is Cyrus. Cyrus collects ghosts for a purpose that is unforeseen at the beginning of the movie.

 Within the first sequence, Cyrus dies in a ghost hunting accident. And wouldn't you know it? He leaves his whole fortune, complete with his creepy ghost collection house to his last remaining family members. You guessed it, the family I referred to earlier are the lucky recipients of the house.

 From here on, excitement and terror ensue. Oh wait, no they don't. Absolutely no excitement or terror ever even peeks it's head onto the screen. What does peek it's head onto the screen are bad one-liners from the token black girl (of course there's the standard ""DAMN! I ain't chillin wit y'all whiteys no mo'""), horrible acting from everyone on screen, and clichd cheesiness pulled right out of every bad horror movie.

 What seems like too soon, the movie shifts from a what could've been a scary horror film into a ""Let's kill those ghost bastards! Who's with me?!"" film.

 And to top it off, only 3 people die! ONLY 3!!! Yes, in the opening sequence more people are killed, but they are not characters of any significance, they are just the ""shocking opening sequence day players."" And even if lots of the main characters did die, it wouldn't have mattered, because every one of them pissed you off anyway. They were all annoying, and most of the time I was either praying for one of them to die horribly or for Shannon Elizabeth to take her clothes off. Neither of which happened.

 The highest point during the movie was when I farted really loud and everyone around me started laughing.  Naturally, I raised my arm to let everyone know it was me.",1122249600,2,2293,4.597051597051597
1667872,3,B00005UQ9W,"""Thirteen Ghosts"" features Tony Shalhoub, F. Murray Abraham, Embeth Davidtz, Shannon Elizabeth, and Matthew Lillard.  It also features Rah Digga and a host of non-speaking(mainly growling and shrieking) ghosts.  The plot is very interesting.  It seems that Cyrus Kriticos(Abraham) has become a collector of dead souls.  He utilizes the psychic abilities of Lillard's character to seek out twelve specific souls that he plans to use in a grand and devious scheme to take over the world.

When things go wrong for Cyrus, he sets into motion a series of events that bring his hardluck nephew(Shalhoub) and his two children to a wonderfully designed glass house that they ""inherit"" from him.  Of course, all of this is part of the plan to take over the world.  Tagging along are a lawyer, the housekeeper(Digga), Lillard, and Davidtz' character who is something of an ecto-lover(think PETA for the dead).

The house and it's lifeless guests are the real stars of this flick, just as the asylum in ""House on Haunted Hill"" and the ship in ""Ghost Ship.""  All of these flicks bear the production of Dark Castle, who have become known for their slick gore and wonderfully evil CGI.  The best ghosts, to me, were ""the Jackal,"" ""the Hammer,"" and ""the Angry Princess.""  All of the ghosts, however, are done flawlessly by the FX team.

Had the film's story been a little spookier, I'd have given it four stars.  As a matter of fact, I feel that it qualifies more as a sci-fi flick than a true horror story.  The ghosts are wonderful, the action is slick, the acting is good(though Elizabeth is too old to be playing such a young and enthusiastic teen), the house is a wonder to look at, and much like the rest of Dark Castle's flicks, it doesn't run too long.  Dark Castle knows when to put a stop to the horror that they crank out, and that's rare in Hollywood these days.

The disc's special features, primarily the short biographies of the ghosts, are pretty good.  There isn't too much to fish through, but the quality of the features is what matters.  I rarely look at the extras, but the biographies add quite a bit to the flick.

So, if you like stylized gore, any of the other flicks by Dark Castle, or genuinely want to watch a pretty slick flick, I recommend ""Thirteen Ghosts"" to you.",1116633600,,2281,4.6575
1667873,2,B00005UQ9W,"13 Ghosts 2001: 4/10 Fantastic set design and creative character (ghost) make-up effects cannot save this overloud, over edited mess. The cast ranges from the where is my paycheck crowd (F. Murray Abraham and Tony Shalhoub), disappointedly clothed (Shannon Elizabeth about 10 years too old to play virginal teenagers and cutie Embeth Davidtz), and remarkably irritating (Alec Roberts playing a little boy you wish would just die. Matthew Lillard in his the most irritating role ever and that's saying something. And female rapper Rah Digger channeling every offensive black maid stereotype and inventing a few new ones. Come to think of it a black maid is so 1960's anyone who is anyone has a European au pair.) Yes the good old black maid stereotype, Digger is apparently channeling Beulah from Party at Horror beach She exclaims she ain't washing no windows (It's an all glass house) and for you film historians out there she doesn't birth no babies either. The rest of the comic relief is at about the same level. With Lillard practically imploding on his performance in a mad dog style that has to be seen to be believed and underutilized Davidtz stuck with the laughable task of playing an environmentalist ghost protector. On the plus side the ghosts are very well done however they don't have nearly enough screen time and look a bit like the cast of Hellraiser is moonlighting. The set design with a giant glass house with beautiful Latin writings on the walls is where the movie shines. I guess in a haunted house movie the ghosts and house are the real stars. It's simply a shame they had to include the plot and characters. Truth be told it would have been a better movie without them.",1112400000,3,1696,4.791808873720137

1667875,1,B00005UQ9W,"This was a horrible horror film, so to ensure that I don't sound cliched with my review, I am going to write out thir13en ways that this film could have been improved.

1. Hacking somebody to bits sells a horror film, not huge boobs. While some may enjoy scenes like this, I find that it distracts from the bigger picture. One of the ghosts had ""huge boobs"" power, which was not very scary in my eyes. What was she going to do? Poke somebody's eye out with the enormous nipples? I don't think she would have sent anyone away in fear. I think most would just cozy in for a warm winter's nap ... because it wouldn't be the holidays if it wasn't much hooter ... hotter at the malls.

2. I don't want to sound racist, but the family seemed to be a bit mismatched. Were all the kids adopted? None of them resembled Tony Shalhoub at all. They didn't even look like their burnt mother. I was confused. They also were very disrespectful of a man that just lost his wife to fire. Everybody knows that a fire death takes anywhere from four to eight months recovery. You shouldn't rush him into normality if you can.

3. I did enjoy the cameo from the guy in the movie Se7en. It is always good when directors that randomly throw in numbers in their title to create a symbolic reference can use the same actors. Look for the guy from Se7en that ate himself to death, then look for the guy that ate himself to death in Thir13en Ghosts. I think you will be able to spot him well.

4. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ... NOW.

5. I enjoyed this film better when the characters had names like Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston and when they battled guys like Slimer and the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man. I mean, there was nothing in this film warning people not to cross their beams. That is a warning that should have been mention.

6. For some odd reason I never saw 13 ghosts. I was counting too. I think, at the most, I saw five. I think some people in the marketing department got the ax after this film.

7. Did anyone catch the phrase ""Semper Ubi Sub Ubi"" written on one of the walls. Not cool.

8. Apparently, in this film, the only way to get rid of ghosts is by throwing a flare at them. Now really people, you could tell that the production team had run out of a budget after developing the glasses and had to resort to flare throwing as a battle weapon. These ghosts needed to realize that they were already DEAD, flares wouldn't hurt them. See, never forget the rules. Train your ghost first, then let him terrorize.

9. Have your ghosts work for you. This was a very common problem in this film. The ghosts were not working for anyone. If you have 13 spirits that need employment, do not allow them to just sit around and sulk. Get working or get out. Kriticos must have been a softy in the workforce because these spirits did not listen to anything or follow any directions. Ghosts need discipline just like you and I.

10. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ... NOW.

11. Can anybody explain to me what F. Murray Abraham was doing in this film? This man is an Oscar winner and he is forced to do work like this? I have no hope for Hollywood.

12. Glasshouses need consistency. This film did not, and the first reason why is because the bathroom was not made of glass (unlike the rest of the house). Consistency. Learn this and you may have mastered the ways of the horror genre.

13. (Nothing.... There were not 13 ghosts so why should I have to worry about 13 points? Riddle me that bucko!)

Overall, this was a horrible film that somehow needed to be watched just once than forgotten about for the remaining days of my existence. Skip it, and you will die a very happy person. Watch it ... and you may become one of the (DUM DAH DAH....) Thir13en Ghosts.

No, and I repeat NO, amount of therapy or medication will able help me become normal again. If I had to spend 1 minute in that house of horrors, I would have died from sheer fright. The acting

was just mediocre, and I always found Tony Shaloub to be a total idiot, however F.Murray Abraham's character Cyrus was the creepiest, weirdest relative one could ever hope for. Talk about a dude who is messed up. Some people just get a big dog to keep people off of their property, but this guy went a little overboard. What kind of nut would venture into a house with all those horrors taking up residence in it ?? Oh yes, and some security system he had for keeping each freak confined. Matthew Lillard played some kind of fool who should have been thrown into a ring with all 13 ghosts. Now that's entertainment. I was sad with regard to the ghost of Shaloubs wife, with the burnt face and all. Now that was not necessary.

""Thirteen Ghosts""  at times bordered on b-movie flim-flam fluff but it ends up packing all the right punches and delivers right on time.

1667879,2,B00005UQ9W,"When it comes to sets, the movie is amazing. As is mentioned in numerous reviews, the glass house is elaborate and breathtaking. It alone makes the movie worth checking out. The cast is somewhat all-star with Tony Shaloub, Shannon Elizabeth, and Matthew Lillard, all giving decent performances. Aside from that, the real reason I was compelled to write this review was due to the main topic of the movie, the thirteen ghosts, which are also the reason I gave the two-star rating.

The ghosts are all very different and original, and in their conceptual form (the drawings of them we see and can be seen in the extras), have a very high potential to be really creepy. Yet when they are brought to life in the movie, they just don't convey nearly the same feeling. When I saw them, I wasn't pulled into the scene. I wasn't seeing them as paranormal entities. All I saw was quite a bit of make-up on very real and physical actors. Look at the kid with the bat. He was a total joke of a ghost. I will give credit to the Jackal and the Witch though. They were the only 2 that began to creep me out. I just feel that more effects added to them in post production would have helped. I would recommend House on Haunted Hill (remake) for some good ghosts and creepiness. I say that not because I think H on HH is the best or scariest movie ever made, but it delivers where Thirteen Ghosts does not.",1100822400,,1389,4.362934362934363

If only Dana's tortured soul new their was a love waiting for her. I am he. I can teach her love and help her to realize that she is the most beautiful and wonderous creature that has ever graced this earth.

Her slash marks are a testimony to the pain of her tortured life. Though blind in one eye, she can still see her image in the mirror. It is this image that has stolen my heart and will forever haunt my dreams. Why did she feel that she had to make herself perfect for men that did not appreciate her? She had already achieved perfection and should have waited for her hero to emerge from the riff raff. Just one look from her dark eyes or a glance at her perfect body would be enough for me to swear an undying love that would last longer than this world.

Dana is my soul-mate. Though we are separated by the life/death barrier. I will find her and give her comfort. Maybe she is already expecting me, for my aura is stronger than most and my years of transcendence training under Master Yong-tet may have summoned her to my presence. If she is waiting for me, I hope first to gain her trust, then appease her anger, and finally show her the way to love.

But what of her message in the bathroom. ""I'm Sorry"" was written plain to see in her own blood. How could this be? She was in the bathtub and cut herself several times. How could she have stepped out of the tub, wrote the message, then return to the tub? True there was blood all over the bathroom, but around the message it was clear. No blood dripping from other cuts, or bloody footprints. I can only assume she wrote it first by cutting herself once, then entered the tub.

But who was she saying she was sorry to? I think perhaps she was delivering a message to me. She did not know me in life, but something told her about me. Perhaps she had her own insight that we were to meet. Maybe she got tired of waiting and the agony that was her life was too much. If only I had found and met her sooner she may still be alive today, happy with me. But alas, her lifeforce fled from her. With her last gasping breath I can only hope she thought of me and hoped I would come for her.

Yes, yes my Princess, my Queen. Let me help you melt away your anger and find joy. I am coming. I am almost there. By this time tonight, you and I will be together as one.

What I also didn't like was Rah Diggas sterotypical role of a nanny to a poor white family.

The gore is excellent with blood and guts gallore! And the house or should I save ""living astrochart/glass maze"",was just amazing.

Visually, the house is spectacular and the ghost effects are interesting.  Many of the ghosts look like there were cast-off Cenobites from Clive Barker's Hellraiser movies (and possibly Nightbreed).  Histories of the ghosts can be found amongst the extras and are best watched before watching the movie (its too confusing without the information).  The plot resolution reminded me of The Cell (you know, where the hero strives through special effects only to have a minor character be the real hero and eliminate the importance of the hero's actions).

Just based on that, I was prepared to crucify this movie. The title screams out ""we're doing a remake, and we want to make it... hip."" Gah. The first thing you must do when watching this film is forget that William Castle made a movie called Thirteen Ghosts. Despite Beck saying in the DVD extras that they did use the original script and just change it a bit, the two look about as much alike as do Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. Consider them two entirely different movies.
Once you do that (and get by the soundtrack, which is simply nauseating), this is actually a fun little movie. While it succeeds only in minor ways in being creepy (it's certainly not in the same league as The Eye), the effects are well-done enough that it does succeed in a few places.
Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub, of Monk fame) is a pretty depressed guy. His wife Jean (Kathryn Anderson, a stuntwoman by trade) was killed in a fire six months ago, his kids Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie) and Bobby (Alec Roberts, recently of Traffic) are driving him crazy, the nanny (the annoyingly named Rah Digga in her screen debut) isn't helping matters, and they're broke. Or so they think. The youngest lawyer on the planet, Moss (JR Bourne, doing better here than in Aftershock-honest), shows up to let Arthur and family know that Arthur's eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) has died, and left Arthur and crew his rather odd house. And a couple of Cyrus' business partners, Dennis (Matthew ""Shaggy"" Lillard) and Kalina (Embeth ""Ash's Girlfriend"" Davidtz), though none of them knows that yet...
You never know what you're going to get from a movie containing Matthew Lillard, and this one is no exception. His performance is strong, but that may only be because the rest of the performances by the main characters here are so weak. F. Murray Abraham is convincing as the epitome of evil in the long opening scene, but other than that, the movie almost begs you to concentrate on the house and the ghosts instead of the plot.
When you do that, this movie becomes everything the miserable The Haunting (Jan de Bont, 1999) was not. The architecture is gorgeous, the ghosts are nasty-looking and deeply disturbing (and a few, most notably Shawna Loyer, have gained their own fan clubs). And really, it's a horror film. How much depth of plot do you want? The main actors are capable, and that's really all that's required for a movie of this caliber. It's standard Hollywood fare. And admit it, you want the house.
Much of the reason the ghosts are so much fun in this movie, according to the extras, is that the ghosts all had full backstories written for them. One wonders if we'll end up getting movies about them. (Seems the production company would be remiss not to at least make one about the Angry Princess-and more of a naked Shawna Loyer could not be a bad thing-but I want to know about the Jackal...)

1667902,4,B00005UQ9W,"William Castle was one of the true geniuses of horror, and Thirteen Ghosts represents a modernized, special effects-heavy remake of his 1960 film of the same name.  I would file this effort under C for cool rather than F for frightening, although I suppose many less inured to the tricks of the horror trade might find this film a frightening detour into madness.  Thirteen Ghosts offers an exciting, gory, romping good time, and I think the real key to its success is not its plot, acting, or CGI effects; rather, it is the movie's establishment of something different from your standard horror fare.  For the most part, all of the action takes place in a single setting, a technological marvel of a house built entirely of glass walls.  While the process of shooting scenes in such a highly reflective setting must have been quite a challenge to the crew, the shooting style allows for a more open-ended atmosphere of fear, where things that go bump in the night can appear where you least expect them.  Of course, the characters cannot see any ghosts on their own; no, you can apparently only see ghosts by donning a pair of safety glasses.  The whole glasses thing is a little shaky, but it stands as a more practical substitute for the 3-D glasses the viewers of Castle's original film were required to wear.  The ghosts, for their part, are very well done, especially the ""angry princess"" who, I have to say, is quite hot (in a bloody, fiendish sort of way).
All the madness traces itself to one Cyrus Kriticos (played in an effectively subtle way by F. Murray Abraham).  He is a collector of many things, especially ghosts, aided immeasurably by psychic and borderline nut Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard).  Rafkin does not discover the real agenda behind Kriticos' capturing of specific, tormented souls until it is almost too late, at which point he finds himself trying to undo the wrong he has done by helping the family of Arthur Kriticos survive Cyrus' designs for them.  The always-oddly effective Tony Shalhoub plays Arthur, a man who lost his wife and everything else he has apart from his kids in a terrible fire.  The gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth plays his daughter Kathy, but Elizabeth's talents are rather wasted in this role (and there are far too few scenes graced with her presence).  The struggling family is overjoyed to learn that weird Uncle Cyrus has left Arthur his estate, and they are as excited as they are intrigued by the new home they come to explore.  With glass walls covered with Latin writing everywhere, extremely modern furnishings, and a sense of grade-A rich, eccentric oddness from top to bottom, the family members see the house as a dream come true.  Of course, the dream soon becomes a nightmare.  There are twelve really, really unpleasant ghosts contained in the basement, and the house turns out to be a machine whose ancient yet modern design serves one specific purpose: to open the gates of hell and grant great power to the man who has wrought this abominable mechanism. Our heroes soon find themselves trapped in the house, accompanied by Rafkin, a mysterious stranger, and the family's stereotypical black, ghost-fearing nanny.  They must fight for both their lives and their sanity as each of the twelve ghosts is released and set to the most fiendish of purposes.  The ending is a little hokey, I have to admit, but it cannot undo all the fun to be had along the way.  The special features are also noteworthy.  Along with a look at the making of the film, you get a look at the history of each of the ghosts in the film; frankly, this background material should have been better interwoven into the plot than it was.
The special effects are, by and large, quite good.  A lot of CGI animation went into the making of this film, and it works amazingly well.  The ghosts themselves are substantial creatures, each with a history of its own, capable and more than willing to unleash their own eternal horrors on the desperate human beings walking the halls of the glass prison.  The ghosts are also remarkably diverse in nature, each bringing his/her own very special bottle of terror to the party.  There are a surprisingly small number of actual deaths to be enjoyed here, but one is rather memorable indeed.  While Thirteen Ghosts doesn't really bring a lot of originality to the table, the elaborate place settings its puts in place for its delightfully tainted meal of gore and fright make the experience one that this horror lover quite enjoyed.",1066608000,34,4503,4.758354755784062
1667903,4,B00005UQ9W,"If you are expecting a Vincent Price style haunted house, think again.  I had heard that it was about a guy inheriting his uncle's haunted house.  When I saw the movie, it was so far off from my expectations, I didn't really like it.  Having watched it a second time, - without those expectations - I realize that it is really a good horror flick.  It is NOT your traditional haunted house kind of story. Go in with the right expectations and I'll bet you'll like it.
Tony Shalhoub (the guy who plays Monk on TV) plays Arthur Kriticos, a widower and father of two, he lost everything (including his wife) in a fire and his salary as a math teacher isn't making ends meet. When he is told that he has inherited his uncle's house (the uncle no one liked because he squandered the family fortune), he and the family are ecstatic.  They and their maid ... I know, if he has no money how does he have a maid, but she is the comic relief so I'll leave it alone ... they go up to see the house and sign the lawyer's papers.
What they don't know is that the uncle squandered the fortune as a ghost collector, and not your garden variety spook either.  These ghosts, predominantly, are the meanest of the mean and they CAN hurt you.  More than that, he found directions in some ancient grimoire of how to build some elaborate machine to open the eye of hell.  The house is not a house at all and the inheritance is really a trap to ensnare Arthur and his family for his uncle's diabolical purposes.
Great special effects and an outstanding perfomance by both Tony Shalhoub and Matthew Lillard makes this a good movie for the horror flick buff.",1066521600,7,1634,4.3519736842105265
1667904,1,B00005UQ9W,"Im sorry but I have to say that this movie, may just be the worst movie ever made. Okay maybe not the worst movie but still an extremly boring one. Honestly, I feel asleep for 5 minutes while waching this movie. Good actors is the only thing this movie has going for it. The actual acting isn't as good. But anyways thirteen ghosts is based on an uncle who is willing to let his brother and his kids live at his house filled with ghosts whom he is studying. It's based on a movie made a while back (can't remember what year) but that movie was supposedly a good movie (I've never seen it.) For most of my friends this movie did alot for them. But this movie did absolutley nothing for me - didn't scare, didn't have anything new or exciting. Maybe the old movie was better but the antics in this movie just bored me. Id rather watch a Paul Walker movie, yes you heard me right Paul Walker - one of the worst actors I've ever seen.
If you want to laugh at supposed to be scary parts wondering if that part was supoosed to be scary, and if you want to fall asleep at the sametime then this is your movie. But If you wanna watch something thats actually scary try The Sixth Sense, The Excorsist, Hannibal, Silence Of The Lambs or The Ring",1066435200,,1235,4.19327731092437

Story revolving around some billionaire, hunting ghosts for a living, trying to collect the 13 Ghosts that would open the doors of hell; he later invites his nephew's family to spend the night in his mansion filled with these ridiculous looking ghosts w/ these ridiculous names like ""The Hammer"" and my favorite ""The Angry Princess"" (Now we know why she's angry... being in this movie after all).  Yup, it gets ridiculously cheesy by the minute.  I felt like I was watching a horrible remake of Ghostbusters.  At least Ghostbusters was fun and entertaining.
Really bad acting doesn't help this movie either.  Shannon Elizabeth's one liners like ""This bathroom is amazing!"" runs through out the course of this movie.  I mean everyone, even Tony Shalhoub are given stupid ridiculous high-school-drama one-liners.  Matt Willard was probably the only decent actor in this movie.  ...
Most important of all, this movie was not even scary!  NOT SCARY!  It's actually more gross than anything else.  This is not a haunted house type of movie at all.

The ghosts, though you never get to see them clearly even though thats why most people wanted to see the movie in the first place, were spectacualr. I especially loved the Jackal. Him and the Angry Princess were the most spotlighted characters and for good reason: She runs around with a butcher knife, completely naked for the whole movie, and he has a large cage on his head and the tattered remains of a straightjacket.

1667914,3,B00005UQ9W,"I like the premise to this tale! Rather original actually IMNSHO. How they go about capturing ghosts and for what purpose... Never seen anything quite like it before. The ending is rather predictable granted. The cornball humor isn't TOO over the top as in many horror flicks.... And I appreciate that! The big muck up here is STORY! If they had given each of the ghosts even a brief characterization run over in the actual movie as is in the DVD's special features, it would've given the story what is essential for a flick of this genre... A ghost story!
That is afterall the basis of ALL stories... The 5 f's; who, what, where, when, why! How the guy got a hook for a hand? What his mommy did to make him psycho? And of course the circumstances of his death which made him a ghost to begin with? What is a ghost story without these neccesities? Now there is a main storyline here... And this is done rather good... But...
Here we have 13 ghosts, and we only get such crucial storyline origins for about 3 of the 13 ghosts, and even those (Spare the dead wife's characterization) are done a bit too vague! So what we are left with is all damned cool looking yet nameless and faceless ghosts that pop up and while they make look very gruesome and may have some scare tactics in that aspect alone... They could've been made so much more creepier had at least a bit of tale been told on each. I take it such origins were never filmed or left out because of time constraints... But this is the movie's biggest flaw. Without it, we're mostly reduced to just eye candy here!
And the eye candy is damned good! The ghosts are indeed gruesome. The sets are great, albeit the house is almost entirely CGI... Which should attest to how great it is since it's fooled most the reviewers. I myself thought it was a set till I scoped out the special features on the DVD.... And I usually have a good enough eye to spot CGI.
It's not a bad flick. There's far worse out there. Unfortuneatly it's just another eye candy reliant film all in all. By all means if you get the DVD, watch the 13 ghosts characterizations FIRST! That'll definitely add some of the needed storyline flair.
Consider my rating a 2.5 stars outta 5! If they had given the ending a bit more of a twist, and incorporated origins for at least most of the ghosts I would give it an easy 3.5 outta 5!",1051142400,3,2351,4.345454545454546

1667922,3,B00005UQ9W,"You certainly have to admire the ambition behind ""Thirteen Ghosts,"" especially for people who were inspired by the legacy of William Castle.  The legendary schlock meister was famous for making movies using a single set and pretty much no matter what story they came up with for this updated version of the 1960 film where you had to wear the special glasses to see the ghosts in the movie it was not going to be as impressive as this set.  In creating the home of Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), Production Designer Sean Hargreaves, Art Director Don Macaulay, and Set Decorator Dominique Fauquet-Lemaitre came up with something innovative and visually stunning.  It is a good thing that the characters go on a tour of the house because the audience is sitting there checking out the place too and not paying attention to what anybody is saying.  When you think of all the low-budget horror films that had great stories but minimum productive values and you see how the makers of ""Thirteen Ghosts"" have squandered the opportunity afforded by this fantastic set, I have to agree with one of the characters and screen very loudly (like the sound level on this film) ""AHHHHHH! I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THAT!""
""Thirteen Ghosts"" (a.k.a. ""Thir13en Ghosts"") is one of those movies where it might have worked better if the exposition came in the prologue of the film.  We learn that this wonderful set is not a house but a machine (""designed by the devil and powered by the dead""), which means all the whirling gears, the sliding glass panels, and the spinning circles on the floor, all have significant meanings.  But we do not learn this until about halfway through the film, by which point you are not really in a position to retroactively go back and make sense of what we have already seen.  I appreciated the film a lot more the second time around, but second viewings are supposed to be to explore the depth of a film and not to figure out what was really going on in the first place.  The set is awesome and the ghosts are suitably gruesome, but the story and the characters are not up to the challenge.  I am serious when I say that if you go set the audio track from English to something you do not speak (your choice) that your comprehension of the film would not seriously suffer.  The look of this film is spectacular, an absolute visual treat and I can only imagine what it was like for the cast and crew when they first arrived on the set. But with all the time and effort spent on the set and makeup, paying equal attention the story (rather than the volume level) could have made this a landmark horror film.
The DVD extras are sparse but decent.  The commentary shows that the people behind the camera were very much enamored with the giant toy they had constructed and the ghosts they had running around.  We also get the back-stories on the 12 ghosts, narrated by the man who should know, Cyrus Kriticos.  This helps to reinforce the problem of the film in terms of understanding what is going on, because here are all this semi-developed back-stories that are barely touched upon in the film.  Ironically, I think with the backstories this script could be turned into a pretty good horror novel.",1045612800,3,3210,4.589160839160839

This was the case for example with ""Ghost Ship"" and ""The House on Haunted Hill"", two other remakes by the Dark Castle Production Company.  I was therefore quite disappointed at just how bad Thirteen Ghosts was.  Thirteen Ghosts is a remake of a William Castle picture by the same title.  The plot (such that it is) centers around a widower's  family who inherits a haunted house.  The house is haunted by the ghosts of thirteen tortured souls that were collected by the previous owner.  The ghosts are kept in place by a series of spells that create a barrier that they can't cross.  The catch is that these spells are written on the glass walls of the house.  The position of the walls is constantly changed by a series of moving gears within the house, thus changing the boundaries by which the ghosts are held.  The ghosts, which can only be seen by special glasses, are quite scary looking.  They remind me of Clive Barker's ""Tortured Souls"" figures.  Unfortunately the ghost visuals can not save the movie from poor dialog, lack of plot, and uninteresting characters.  There are several scenes that will make you jump, and the gore factor is fairly high, but I would not say the movie is particularly scary.  After a while it just gets tedious.  Even the most hard core horror fan will likely be disappointed by this flick.",1044316800,2,1409,4.670731707317073
1667924,3,B00005UQ9W,"Promising chills galore, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" proves to be anything but scary. The premise is cool, and the actors turn in fine performances (and Shannon Elizabeth is just soooooooo hot), but the chill factor is just unable to come through. The makeup and visuals are impressive, but not scary. I just don't see anything scary about a naked princess chick (yeah, the actress who played her looks great, but the makeup just ruined it.). It just goes to show you that everyone thinks that blood and gore is scary. But, after the success of films like ""Signs,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" Hollywood should realize that graphic violence isn't that scary anymore. It may have worked for ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" but those films are classics. Time for Hollywood to turn out more ""True"" scary films.

I am talking about the dazzling visual effects, the detailed make-up on the ghosts, and the very creative killings (always appreciated). All of these things, however, cannot make a movie, which Thirteen Ghosts proves. The plot is simply not there -- wait, let me rephrase -- there is a plot. But it is so corny and cliched, that anyone who has seen a handful of movies can tell exactly where it is heading. Also, the characters are annoying, most noteably the nanny, who spouts off typical and corny ""crazy white people"" lines like she was the female Martin Lawrence. The kid is annoying. I did appreciate Tony Shalhoub, and Shannon Elizabeth is always nice to look at. Also, like I mentioned before, this film looks gorgeous. The first viewing, my eyes were glued to the screen. However, the movie doesn't offer much else. I own it on tape and have only watched it one and a half times. It's a little too boring for what it's trying to do. Think of it as a bad cross between The Amityville Horrors and Nightmare on Elm Street.",1044144000,2,1122,4.615

The character of the nanny was a huge step back for black actors. She was dumb, loud and at one point does a turntable rap effect. She also spend the whole movie cursing, whinning and rolling her eyes and showing her teeth. Had this been made in 1921 all this would be excusable but for 2001 it was shocking.

1667930,3,B00005UQ9W,"Ah yes, the ever-popular B-movie.  This movie is exactly that, and as with all B-movies, there will be those who like it, those who don't, and those who thought it was okay but were generally bored.
Trying to put all these somewhat conflicting reviews into perspective, I would say that the plot has a couple of unique twists, the house is great, and there is a death I hadn't seen before.  If the twists, the house or the death didn't hold your interest or intrigue you, then you quickly lost interest and either became bored, or didn't like the movie at all.
The story is relatively simple, and some parts of it parallel other horror movies.  A ghost-hunting relative (in this case, an uncle) dies (there's a twist here), leaving a huge mansion and a lot of money to a relatively poor relative.  The poor relative moves his family along with assorted hangers-on and intruders into the relative's house.  The deceased relative had ulterior motives for wanting his heir to move into the house (which I won't talk about - there have to be some surprises), and miscellaneous acts of gory violence ensue.
I understood early on that the ghosts appearing and disappearing even when wearing the special glasses was an ability that the ghosts had, but they had to appear to cause physical events.  However, the popping in and out, which was initially interesting, became annoying.  Some of the early manifestations had some level of scare factor.  Most especially the bath tub scene and one scene in the basement; afterward the affect was diluted as you became numb to ghosts popping in and out.
The concept that the ghosts in the basement were there to power a portal to hell was interesting, along with the technique the uncle used to unleash the ghosts and direct them to their appropriate locations.
There was a lot of acting horsepower in this movie, including Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth, F. Murray Abraham, Matthew Dillard, and Embeth Davidtz (who also starred in ""Matilda"", if you can believe that).  In general the acting was decent, though I struggled a couple of times with Tony Shalhoub's struggle to accept Matthew Dillard's insistence that supernatural events were occurring in the house; it felt a bit artificial.  Even with all that horsepower, the real star of the movie was the house, a conglomeration of glass, antiques, Latin inscriptions, and, of course, ghosts.  There were several flaws with the house.  First, the scenes of the central engine were shown time after time, and ultimately began to feel like filler since it didn't really advance the plot.  Second, you never really knew where you were in the house other than in general terms, so while the house was big, the immensity was conveyed only when looking from the outside.  Third, just how did Embeth Davidtz get into the house after it appeared to close up?  Her answer seemed more than a stretch...something the director made up while having a martini.
This movie had a lot of potential.  The basic concept was solid, and the acting horsepower unusual for a B horror movie.  However, while there were flashes of excellence, overall the movie delivered only part of the goods.  Those flashes of excellence pushed the movie into a 3-star rating, thus making it watchable.  Forgive the parts of the movie where it drags or has plot implausibilities.",1043020800,4,3329,4.84982332155477
1667931,5,B00005UQ9W,"I liked this movie simply because it was strange.  It was a normal predictable horror movie with a typical bunch of characters thrown into a situation together, trying to fight for survival.  I really don't mind that as long as the characters mesh well.  The only character I really didn't like was the *nanny*.  She seemed to be a filler role in the film, without much purpose.  I considered her the whiner of the bunch.
I loved the concept of the whole movie, mainly because I hadn't heard of the idea before.
It's hard to make a movie with a new subject matter anymore, so i give the writer a lot of credit for that alone.

1667932,4,B00005UQ9W,"The film has a lot of tension and is totally creepy. The story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of a glass house haunted by 13 ghosts is very good with cool special effects (I haven't seen the original Thirteen Ghosts). The suspense levels are fairly high and the frights come from the look of the ghosts. I thought the ghosts were well designed and realised with some of them being freaky like the Jackal, but it would have been more useful had their background been included in the actual movie to see some depth in their characters instead of watching it on a separate ghost files on the DVD. Also, the ending was a bit disappointing and could have been better, still it flowed with the story.
Overall, if you are looking for an entertaining movie with good special effects, then Thirteen Ghosts is just the film for you. It's pretty suspenseful and the ghosts are awesome!",1041897600,,895,4.530864197530864

1667935,3,B00005UQ9W,"Thirteen Ghosts is one heck of a horror movie. Forget the cast and their characters (Annoying kid, and why did Shannon Elizabeth's character have to be so fake and obsessed with bathrooms?), tune in for the actual 13 ghosts and great directing shots given by Steve Beck. Suspense and minorly frightening imagery is displayed throughout. The imagery is flashy -- not subtle -- but it's pulled off very well. The ghosts are all greatly done. The interesting supplement on the DVD explaining each ghost's backstory is a great addition to the DVD.
 Pardon me for saying to forget about the cast. Half of it does work. Rah Digga as the nanny, Maggie, is here for the one liners. I found her funny and cared for her most as a character. Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is one of the antagonists, and her twist around in the movie wasn't all that surprising, but she played her part fairly well. Matthew Lillard was on and off the whole, but his performance was enjoyable. What was off was Shannon Elizabeth's performance. Was she meant to be playing a 12 year old? Her all too goody show at the beginning just threw me off. And the little kid, egh...I won't bother.
 Thirteen Ghosts has great horror qualities when it comes to suspense, imagery, and scares. But it seemed to fail with its cast (Not including the ghosts, who were great). And the DVD is a good buy with great animated menus and awesome supplements.",1041206400,2,1400,4.641129032258065

Though it starts off a little confusing as to what exactly the premise is, the movie explains it all in time and takes you on a rollercoaster ride of a excellent horror movie.

He stars with Shannon Elizabeth and Matthew Lillard as they try to stop the ghosts and save their lives.  Twelve ghosts have been captured by the evil Uncle Sirius, who has since died and left his evil house of horrors to his nephew, Shalhoub, and his family.

1667943,2,B00005UQ9W,"There's nothing like a good ghost story to get the juices flowing, and not one that merely opens a creaky closet door and says, ""Boo!"" but one that grabs! you by the nape of the neck and commands your attention with a bona fide scare.  Unfortunately, such films are few and far between, and though ""Thir13en Ghosts,"" directed by Steve Beck, is perhaps not the ""Grand Guignol"" it aspires to be, it is nevertheless a valiant attempt and will do in a pinch.  And it does have the added bonus of having something of a unique twist to it:  Whereas most stories dealing with supernatural apparitions are the result of chance encounters or happenstance, even those set within the tried and true venue of the ""haunted house,"" the spirits confronted here do not arise from accident, but by design.  The burning question becomes, of course, by whose design and for what purpose?  Ah, but therein lies our story, eh?
In the film's prologue, we are introduced to one Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), a man of obvious wealth and means who has apparently made it his life's work to capture the disenfranchised spirits of those who have died a violent death, encasing them in holding cubes made of impenetrable glass.  But before the opening credits have ended, Cyrus falls victim to one of his intended trophies, a particularly rambunctious soul who apparently doesn't take kindly to the idea of being kept in a cage.
Upon the passing of Cyrus Kriticos, his entire estate-- which is rather substantial-- is bequeathed to his nephew, Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a math teacher currently in the throes of some personal travails, who barely knew his uncle and had, in fact, only met him once or twice in his life.  As often happens in life, however, it is from this least expected source that Arthur seemingly finds the solution to his problems, for his inheritance, which includes a rather unique mansion-- albeit in a remote area-- insures his solvency for the rest of his life.  But upon entering this singular house left behind by Cyrus, Arthur's life and that of his family is about to change in ways he could never dream of, none of which are not good, and all of which have to do with something Cyrus left in the basement.  And just like that, with the flapping of the butterfly's wings in China, a tidal wave is about to hit shore a continent away.
Working from a screenplay by Neal Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio (from a story by Robb White), Beck has crafted and delivered a less than compelling film that has it's moments, but relies primarily on the special F/X for the impact it's attempting to make.  The film has it's moments, but to put it into perspective using the one hundred floor ""Haunted House Spooky/scary"" scale, it checks in on about the fiftieth floor, just a couple below ""The House on Haunted Hill"" (1999).  ""The Others"" (2001), meanwhile, currently occupies the penthouse, while the dreary ""The Haunting"" (1999) is, and will forever languish in, the basement.
The ghosts here are disconcertingly gruesome, though some of them tend to be a bit over the top; a few of them appear to be the product of a mad designer who should have had his sketching crayon taken away from him sooner.  A few less spikes, bolts, piercings and protrusions would have made them more convincing; as it is, they don't have enough ""humanity"" left in them to be credible as formerly living beings.  It's a good case for the ""less is more"" theory, in fact.  The real interest in this film is the house itself, which is perhaps the most unique design in the annals of the cinematic haunted house.  With it's glass walls filled with Latin inscriptions and it's ability to alter itself into a claustrophobic maze at will, it is actually more jarring and shocking than the otherworldly denizens it houses in it's subterranean recesses.  Arguably, it can be said that the house is, in point of fact, the star of the movie.  And Beck does use it to good effect.
The real star, however, is Tony Shalhoub, as the unwary nephew, Arthur.  Shalhoub has emerged as one of the finest character actors in the business, and even if the character he is playing is a rather straight forward, ""normal"" every day type, which is basically who Arthur is, nobody does it better.  What makes him so good is that he has the ability and talent to make whatever character he's portraying believable and convincing, whether it's an alien in ""Men In Black,"" a street prophet in ""Life or Something Like it"" or your run-of-the-mill generic math teacher.  He works from the inside out, which gives his characters depth and nuance; deep down Shalhoub IS that person, before he-- whomever it is-- ever makes a physical appearance.  And THAT is good acting.
After Shalhoub, however, there's nothing much of note here, performance wise.  Abraham does a good turn as Cyrus, but his role is little more than a glorified cameo with little room for character development, and even though what he does is good, there's no getting around the fact that early on his Cyrus falls into stereotype.
Matthew Lillard does a quirky turn as Dennis, but looking at him for any length of time can be distracting; Shannon Elizabeth, as Arthur's daughter, Kathy, is too pert and perky to be effective, with a perpetual smile that would be more fitting in a toothpaste commercial or ""Starship Troopers 2"" than here; Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is simply underused; young Alec Roberts (Bobby) is annoying; and making her acting debut, Rah Digga (better known as the ""female"" MC and only woman in Busta Rhymes' renowned Flip Mode Squad), as the nanny, Maggie, leaves a lot to be desired, which pretty much sums up ""Thir13en Ghosts.""

Believe me, this movie will freak you out. Don't make the mistake of watching it alone at night like I did. There are alot of frightening parts, so this is just ONE:
Arthur and Kathy are in the hall (Arthur ahead of her). Kathy stops and slowly puts on the glasses. The Jackal is RIGHT in front of her.
The music video by Tricky is extremely catchy. I just kept playing it over and over. At first, I didn't like the song, but I guess it just grew on me. I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! If you don't see the movie AT LEAST hear the song.

1667948,2,B00005UQ9W,"OK, here again.  Willaim Castle remake.  The second outing from film campany Dark Castle Enterainment (Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis) is based on the film made in 1960, but with special effects and elabolate production designs in place of William Castle's now legendary ""gimmick.""  (If you don't know Castle, see Joe Dante's film ""Matinee"" whose John Goodman character is loosely based on him.)  But like ""House on the Haunted Hill"" the result is not impressive, sporadically scary but ultimately boring.
Yes, sorry, but I am bored.  The story is, as with all Castle's films, intriguing.  A father named Arther (Tony Shalhoub) inherits a house from his long-absent uncle Cyrus (F. Murry Abraham).  But the house, of which walls are all made of transparent glass, has a deadly secret -- it keeps a collection of ghosts!  Now Arthur and his family, moving into the haunted house, are to experience most uncomfortable night ever seen.
This simple premise is always the strength of the first-rate entertainer Willaim Castle's virtue, and though his films are sometimes based on too incredible setup, he knew how to amuse us, with his well-known gimmicks (like ""Emergo Vision"").  He used for the original a gimmick called ""Illusion-O"" -- the audience wear a pair of special glasses that enable the ghosts on the screen to appear or to vanish, according to the scenes.
In the remake, the idea is extended (or borrowed), and the characters can see ghosts (!) provided when they wear special glasses.  That's a good idea, though the director Steve Beck (first-time feature director, previously responsible for special effect art design) ruined it by ... you know what.  Too fast changes of cut, cut, cut ... a train of flashing images of ghosts showing up and suddenly vanishing ....  Watching these scenes is really trying, I warn you, and my eyes started to get weary soon.  And first of all, Matthew Lillard appears as a psychic who can ""see"" or feel the ghosts.  So, what's the point of introducing him while all you can do to see those horrid ghosts is to wear that device?
The film is full of such inconsistency as would destroy any suspence -- Embeth Davidtz pops up suddenly in the house where every one is supposed to be trapped within.  Asked by the scared inhabitants how come she made it to the inside, she gives an awkward explanation: in short, she happened to find a door open, but sorry, it is closed now!  Great.  Well, the truth will be revealed after all, but those inept dialogues or situations are all working against the film's total result.
The house in case impresses us, with its costly designs, but as the inside layout is not clear, we don't grasp the sense of confined place even after the ghosts are at large.  The sense of thrill is weakened by its so confused presentation of the structure of the house, that we don't know these ghosts are coming or going, behind the glass panel or not.  In this way, things look all in confusion while the story is also muddled.  Soon we lose what little interest we had.
Tony Shalhaub is good, as always, and Abraham is standard Abraham, so that's ok.  Shannon Elizabeth (goodlooking foregin student in ""American Pie"" and its esequel) is not bad, Davidts is literally wasted, but most lamentable is Lillard, who is so good in ""Scooby-Doo,"" but here he single-handedly blows up the film with too hammy acting.
When I saw this film in theater in Kyoto, before that feature presentation we had a chance to see the trailer of ""Jason X.""  Frankly, I thought that trailer is more interesting than this one.  Perhaps, all of us shared the thought.",1031011200,2,3601,4.763285024154589

  It is nothing more than a shockfest, and the filming is done so ineptly that you can't even really be shocked by what your seeing. There isn't enough time. It jerks around from scene to scene, real time to, I suppose, ghost time; blood (lots and lots of blood) and guts to pristine glass. Maybe there was supposed to be some sort of story within the story, but I already saw the original and knew what potential was there for a really good, fun, cool movie.
  What I found really disappointing was the characters, that of the ghosts and of the ""living"" people. In the original, you almost feel sorry for these lost souls that are trapped in the house.

This film didn't do that for me instead we have ghosts locked up in a glass house which was more like the worlds largest greenhouse.
The ghosts looked more like the living dead than ghosts, they looked more like zombies that never made it in the Night Of The Living Dead films.
There were some rather sick moments in the film which leaves you wondering if the director and writer had very disturbed minds.
The effects were very good in some bits and make up was really good to, but they are only the good sides of this film the rest of this film was a load of rubbish, and makes you wonder if Hollywood film makers have ever seen or read a ghost story in their lives.
I would have given this film no stars but the special effects and make up give it just about 1 star a very poor story indeed for a film.",1029801600,,984,4.0
1667955,2,B00005UQ9W,"I actually had somewhat expectations for Thirteen Ghosts, considering it was from the same production team that gave us the House on Haunted Hill remake, a mindless, but enjoyable scary thrill ride.  Unfortunately, Thirteen Ghosts is mostly mindless, with a handful of good moments here and there, but hardly enough to make this worthwhil to even horror buffs.
Tony Shalhoub stars as a teacher whose wife was killed in a fire that burned down their house.  Shalhoub and his two kids are in financial troube, but their problems seem to be solved when Shalhoub's late uncle (F. Murray Abraham, proving furhter that he's not nearly as good an actor as his Oscar might indicate) will his house to his niece.  Unlukcy enough for Shalhoub and his family, the entire place locks up and it turns out twelve ghosts inhabit the place and are looking to cause some death and destruction.
Thirteen Ghosts is mess, thanks to Steve Beck's hyperkinetic direction.  In true MTV-style, Beck flashes several frames per second, making this an assault on the senses that's even more unbearable than Stigmata.  I don't understand, does Beck actually believe these quick cuts will generate scares?  Does he believe he's made a truly frightening film because of this style?  If he does, I feel sorry for the guy because all he's accomplished is creating doldrums.  Yes, Thirteen Ghosts commits the cardinal sin of a Hollywood thrill ride: it's boring.
Why is this?  Aside from the direction, it's pretty obvious who's expendable and who isn't.  You know Shalhoub and his family are going to make it through more or less unscathed, which is too bad because I would have liked to have seen Shannon Elizabeth in a gruesome death scene.  Faring the best of the cast is Matthew Lillard, who's always amusing, and actually kind of likeable here.
As I said before, there are a few good points.  A couple of death scenes are fairly memorable and some of the ghosts' physical appearances are appropriately ghastly.  The production design is actually fairly impressive, but not my cup of tea.  The idea of glass walls that make up a house might interest some, but I prefer a good old-fashioned mansion for a haunted abode.
It'd be a bit pointless to mention how brainless the movie is (they remove glass at one point for protection from the ghosts) why not just remove more and more glass until they reach outside?) or how goofy the plot twists are (I bet you'd never expect the ending would be taken straight from, gag, Casper!).  I've come to expect such silliness from these films, but certainly, the trashiness factor didn't hurt House on Haunted Hill because it was enjoyable from beginning to end (and really, it was good trash).

1667963,5,B00005UQ9W,"I would say that ""Thir13en Ghosts"" is a cross between ""Cube"" and ""House On Haunted Hill"".
The opening 10 minutes of the film is intense, we are introduced to Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), a man who has an obsessive hobby of capturing and torturing disgruntled spirits, aided by an insecure psychic named Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard). The scene then shifts to a drab apartment occupied by Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth) son Bobby (Alec Roberts) and baby-sitter Maggie (Rah Digga) ever since a fire demolished their house and Arthur's wife. Things begin to look up when a lawyer (JR Bourne) arrives to inform Arthur that he has inherited his uncle Cyrus' mansion. Arthur and his family decide to travel up to visit the house with lawyer that evening, this is when things start to get a bit weird. It turns out that Cyrus' mansion is made entirely of glass. All of the rooms are transparent and one can see from one side of the house to the other. As they all enter the house, they are accompanied Dennis disguised as a ""power guy"". They all begin to realise that the house may indeed be a giant glass coffin, as it becomes apparent that all isn't what it seems. Cyrus did in fact detain his angry ghosts in the basement of the glass mansion. The characters wander aimlessly around the house looking for a way to escape, and the ghosts are being released from their secure cells one by one, and are a bit peeved. Each ghost is given an individual look and they are certainly creepy and disturbing, and characters can only see them if they wear a pair of ""special glasses"". The film is full of suspense as the ghosts are released and could attack anyone at anytime. This movie is full of horror, dark humour, twists and a great cast (Matthew Lillard plays a great part). It is clear the cast and crew had a fun time making it. Along with the film, there is a 19-minute feature entitled ""Thirteen Ghosts Revealed"" which examines the production of the film, the special make-up effects and the visual effects. Here, we are treated to interviews to cast and crew, as well as insights into the designing of the ghosts and the house. The most interesting aspect here is the focus on the make-up effects and the amount of dedication that the actors and crew put forward. Whilst watching the movie ""Thirteen Ghosts"", most viewers will note that the ghosts themselves are highly detailed, but we never get any background information on them. That is rectified with the ""Ghost Files"" (another brilliant Special Feature). Here, we get an in-depth biography for each of the ghosts, complete with illustrations and narration by F. Murray Abraham.

Anyway, I think it's a very well done horror movie and I don't understand why the critics are so fond of picking on it. They say things like it wasn't scary at all, but that's just a sign of them playing it cool - instead, I'm sure they crept under the chair when they were watching it! I think that it's got a good amount of scariness, making you afraid to watch the next scene, but not so much gore as to make it seem almost funny, like Freddy Kruger from ELM Street - that was too obvious they were trying to make it gory. When I watched Thirteen Ghosts, I sometimes couldn't even bear to watch a normal scene because I sensed something terrible is going to happen - that's the aim of horror movies and I don't know why critics ALWAYS find something to criticize. Thirteen Ghosts is about a family which inherits a glass house after their ""dead"" uncle, but what they don't know is that there are thirteen souls trapped in the basement of the house and as soon as the doors get closed, the clockwork starts working, releasing each ghost one by one... The uncle, Cyrus, wanted the father, Arthur, to be the next victim so that his Black Zodiac of ghosts would be completed, which is needed for the Ocularis Infernum (I think it's called this way) which he wanted to have to have power. So in the movie, the young son Bobby gets lost in the dark corridors of the basement, so everybody is trying to look for him. Fortunately, there is also a psychic which can sense ghosts and in that way is very useful in helping them get together and escape.
If you're not really into horror movies, then it's not going to be your best choice, but even I'm not so crazy about horror movies and I think this one was really good. If you want to get some adrenaline into your blood and get scared out of your wits, then go for this movie - it's going to leave you wanting more, searching Thirteen Ghosts websites (by the way I know a really COOL Thirteen Ghosts website, much better than the official site - go check it out, it's called thir13en_website.tripod.com - then go to the main page by clicking ""go"" and you'll find everything you need there) - so I recommend this movie to people who want to get scared out of their wits, or for horror-movie fans who seek some decent gore and a bit of a suspense.

Will we ever see a ""horror"" film in which the simple-minded good-guys (and small children) DON'T save the day and triumph over a ridiculously greater and more powerful evil?  I mean... Come on!  That's Disney stuff!
""The Omen?""  A very good horror flick.  Why?  Everybody dies and evil triumphs.  ""The Exorcist?""  Excellent!  Why?  The priests die and the demon escapes.  ""Blair Witch?""  Creepy!  Why?  Everybody dies and the evil entity continues unmatched.  ""The Shining?""  (I'm talking about the movie and not the book.) Haunting!  Why?  The possessed hotel continues even though two people escape.  ""13 Ghosts?""  Funny.  Comic relief every 2 minutes.  Even half of the ghosts themselves were laughable.  And that babysitter...

Please please spare me these ""horror"" movies where bad actors/actresses defeat the very powers of Hell and Satan himself!  Leave that stuff for the kiddies to watch on Saturday cartoons.
There was truly some dark and evil potential in this movie.  It was completely wasted.  There were a couple of wicked and horrific monsters here - completely wasted.

Ghostbuster Matthew Lillard, Abraham's former paranormalist colleague, tries to clear Shalhoub and his family out of the house, but instead gets himself trapped inside it with them - seems Abraham built the thing as a high-tech ghost-trap, and now that they're all inside it, the mechanism of the house has come to life to release the imprisoned ghosts inside, and ultimately open the doorway to Hell...
It's slick and scary, more a roller coaster ride than a spook house. The performances are adequate, but they don't really want to be more than that, since the real star of this production is the house, which is gorgeous to behold. The script is clever, the effects quite good. The 13 ghosts of the title are splendidly and memorably bizarre and gruesome.
Amazingly, the kids in the movie neither detract from the horror nor make it worse - the violence isn't that bloody for the most part, and the horror is more in gruesome apparitions than anything else. There is a fair share of nastiness and a bit of ghoulish nudity - it's hardly rated ""G"" - but it's more stylish than genuinely frightening.

I have to say that my favorite one was the Jackal, who had arusty metal cage locked around his head, therefore he looked very beastly and evil!
The plot is quite simple, but heck... horror movies are not based on this, so you shouldn't complain! You wanna see a horror movie? Fine, so don't expect a complex plot and then throw dirt on it by saying it was meaningless and boring!
Arthur Kriticos, losing his wife in a terrible fire, is left to raise his two kids alone, with a help of a nanny Maggie. His eccentric uncle Cyrus Kriticos, a ghost-buster, is killed when he has captured the twelth ghost. He leaves his house to Arthur.
Rafkin, a psychic able to communicate with ghosts, helped Cyrus trap the ghosts in the amazing glass house. Only he seems to know what is really happening in the house. He warns Arthur who doesn't believe and is too stunned by the house and his luck to care. When his kids start dissappearing, the exits are sealed off and Rafkin borrows Arthur special glasses (seeing the gruesome poltergeists around him), he believes.

The new Thirteen Ghosts was good, but a little overwhelming. A little suspense is just as good as state of the arts technology. Sometimes it works better to create a true classic horror movie. The ""Haunting"", both versions, the new and remake are an example of a good transition in generations of film making.",1021248000,,870,4.409937888198757

Obviously no one who took part in the recreation of this film took into consideration the audience.  Special effects lacked especially for this day and age.  Total movie was not believable, starting with the very beginning.

1667996,3,B00005UQ9W,"On it's own, Thirteen Ghosts is nothing spectacular, unless you're talking about the ghosts themselves, but the DVD version has some cool extras that make it more worthwhile.
The movie starts out promising, with a really cool opening scene in a junkyard.  After that, the story kind of goes downhill, with a family moving into a house made out of glass (before you say it, there already is the required ""no throwing stones"" joke in the movie, and it's not funny there, either) that also happens to house a machine designed (allegedly) by the devil and twelve ghosts that are being released one by one to attack the family.  The ghosts are all really cool looking and the attack scenes are awesome.  There are some very chilling moments in those, especially when they come out of nowhere, since the characters need special glasses to see them.
Acting-wise, the best I can say about this is that Shannon Elizabeth's in it, but only for the first half.  Tony Shalhoub, who plays the dad and was also in Wings I believe, is decent, but he doesn't have a whole lot to work with.  Matthew Lillard is just a bit too campy in this, while the nanny is just plain annoying and unnecessary.  F. Murray Abraham is decent as Uncle Cyrus, but he's hardly on-screen at all.
The plot gets kind of murky, as if the writers didn't know how to get from point A to point B.  There's a plot twist towards the end that's interesting, but isn't anything Earth-shattering.  The whole thing feels extremely rushed, with another character eventually revealing the secret of the house and how to stop it.  The ending is especially unsatisfying, with no insight as to how the dad figured out what was going on.
The movie really shines in the extras.  There's a neat documentary on the film, including how they did the makeup and special effects.  The best extra, though, is the ghost files, which gives a history on twelve of the ghosts in the movie.  These are fascinating and really interesting if you're into the occult.
Like I said, the movie on it's own is only worth recommending to see the scenes with the ghosts.  If the movie had been just about the ghosts, it would have been great.  The extras on the DVD make this at least a solid rental if you've got time to browse.  I will say watch the movie first, or else you spoil one of the surprises in the film.",1020297600,,2338,4.520190023752969
1668017,4,B00005UQ9W,"When I first saw this film in the theaters,I wasn't exactly won over,but the DVD inclusion of the ""Ghost Files"",helps A LOT! An initial problem with this film,is you don't really get a good perception of the ghosts,visually or background-wise.(Quick cut views,and snippets of information.). But on the DVD,you get F.Murray Abrahams,doing his best Rod Serling impression,with the Ghost Files,containing great images,sketches,explanations,and the missing information that would've made the film less tangled.
That said...the film is good,but not great. Tony Shalhoub,always puts in a brilliant performance,and is no less a presents here as the widower,who suddenly inherits a haunted house from a rich dead uncle,F.Murray Abraham.( quite the scoundral.).Eddie Lilliard is the standout performance as the man who can sense the ghosts,and knows what's really going on in the mansion....or so he thinks. Embeth Davidtz,coming quite a ways since ""Army of Darkness"" is the activist who believes in the rights of the undead. ( You laugh,but in this day and age,you can bet there is one somewhere out there!)and Shannon Elizabeth is the teenage daughter,whom gets to scream alot.( Necessary for all horror films.)
The film works,for the most part. Although it isn't anywhere close to the original William Castle film,aside from the basic plot. The upgrades are creative,the writing is good,and of course visual effects have come a long way since 1960. But I feel the producers missed the big picture.( As they did with the updated ""House On Haunted Hill""). William Castle was all about entertaining the audience,sure he loved to scare us,but he also loved to tease us too. He loved cheap gimmicks and audience participation. He set up ""shock chairs"" for ""The Tingler"",or handed out ""Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down"" audience voting cards for ""Mr. Sardonicus"". He also wasn't opposed to showing up suddenly,mid-film,and taunting the audience,breaking down the 4th wall. Basically,he didn't take it all too seriously. I think the minor complaint I have,is the new version wants so much to scare,it forgets to tender it a bit,like Castle did. We love Castle because he was,cheesey at times.
The only bad part of this film,and I am frankly amazed it even exsists,is the character played by Rah Digga. Her character is not only an added character,but a bad idea as well. Portraying the nanny/babysitter,she is nothing less than a cross between Jar-Jar Binks,Stephen Fetchit,and Whoopi Goldberg. With lines like, ""I don't do windows"" & ""Crazy white people"",it's a wonder why any actress,black or white,would've taken this role. Her character is secondary to the story,and doesn't do all that much,other than recite ""ethnic"" lines. Shame on the writers for this.",1019865600,,2736,5.335648148148148

This time its a glass house with moving glass walls that are etched with latin spells to keep the ghosts in. You can tell that a lot of money went into the production and the effects, and the performances were somewhat above average.  It was nice to see F. Murry Abraham (Amadeus) working again.  Unfortunately he wasn't given much to work with. He appears only twice and both times consist of 2-dimensional angry diatribes.
Matthew Lillard (Scream, Wing Commander) walks away with it playing the a psi-sensitive who seems to be the only one who knows what's going on. Without giving anything away, let me just warn you that the ending leaves a lot of unanswered questions.  A good effort.  Its nice to see someone actually spending serious money on making horror movies.  All in all its pretty tame.  The concept will interest fans of the genre, but it really doesn't open any new doors (or windows as the case may be). Question to the writer: ""would you please tell me what the heck the big wheel on the floor of the ""living room"" was for?  It was refered to as a door or something but it's never made clear.

It is based upon William Castle's 1960 film, which, although cheesy and dated, is actually a better film than this remake.  Even having seen the previous version, it still took a long time for me to understand what exactly was going on here.  This movie spends more time developing the ""characters"" of the ghosts than it does with the living people in the film.  The characters are completely unmemorable.  The wisecracking housekeeper was clearly added for comic relief, but seems out of place in this movie.  I'm not saying the acting was bad (you can't do better than F. Murray Abraham), but you don't learn enough about any of these people to care about them.  Some of them die, and you're left thinking, ""Who cares?""  Only the bare essentials of the original's plot is used, and very little of anything new was added.  The scene in which the mother, who was alive in the original but has been killed in a fire here, comes back in ghost-form to tell the family how much she still cares is sheer hokiness.  We, as an audience, don't care at all about these people, and even less about her.  Sure the new house looks kinda cool, but the original was much creepier and came complete with a built-in Margaret Hamilton.  And the ""ghost viewers"", which were handed out to movie theater patrons in 1960 (and are included in the DVD of the original version), are only worn by the actors in this version, and look like something the costume department bought by the gross at 68 cents a pair.  At least the one in the original movie showed some imagination.

1668048,2,B00005UQ9W,"The beginning is interesting as you have people catching ghosts and the story introduces you to the core of it all, the 13 ghosts. You are mislead into thinking the 13 ghosts are significant and you may get to know them. However, you find out that it's not so. You only wish it is going to be a mystery shocker, but it turns out to be cornier than the field of dreams.
The ghosts are interesting because they are all unique, but unfortunately, we never get to know them. They are each given cool nicknames, but we never are told why. For example, one ghost, the most noticeable one: ""The Angry Princess"". She is featured naked with breast implants. What makes her a princess and why is she angry? Why did she spare Kathy Kriticos' (Shannon Elizabeth) life? How on Earth did she make her way upstairs while the other ghosts remain downstairs? The film has so many corny and traditional aspects of horror movies. It also reminds me so much of House on Haunted Hill that I guessed some of the story ... In fact, the story is from the same writer, Robb White.
Don't forget to throw in your old ""collect certain pieces to summon a gateway to hell and control the world"" plot. Writers just love to use this plot, but never explain why it works -- it just does. People say the most scary ghost is the Jakal, but I have seen ghouls like him before. He is wearing a metal or wooden cage on his head so I know he can't bite me. In fact, I think I can beat him up myself. What scares me is the big fat guy who is hanging out with a little old lady that looks like a child (The Dire Mother and the Great Child). Now that couple scares me. I imagine him a child molestor and cannable. Oh yeah, Lurch from the New Addams Family is the Juggernaught. If you ask me, I think the Hammer would whoop his behind.
With all those mechanical devices moving around and the ghosts being locked up and not locked up, I am not even sure the director knew what the hell was going on. Why the hell does the Angry Princess return to the basement when she was loose upstairs? Why didn't they fight each other? They were ugly, bloody, angry, and restless, so I'm thinking they wouldn't get along.
Good idea, but the story is too weak. I'm sorry and I sympathize with the fact that the film makers didn't have as much time as they would've liked; thus had to discard a lot of the story; however, I'm afraid I have to judge the movie for what it is, not what it could've been. It's a shame that a nice idea couldn't be glued together like the implants on the Angry Princess' chest.

Thirteen Ghosts is primarly a horror movie, but it has great thrills and the ghosts are fantastic.  The reason I gave it four stars is because I didn't want it to touch the sci-fi side but it did.  I didn't like the idea of the big metal thing in the room and the thing that the daughter and son were trapped in.
I believe Dark Castle entertainment did a good job with the film.  The actors were fantastic and the director did a great job with filming the ghosts and everything. Each ghost had a good story to them and they were all different and unique in their own ways.
The story is about a family who lost their mother when their house burnt down.  The father still hasn't overcome it.  One day a man comes to their house and says hes the father's uncle's lawyer.  The uncle was rich and had died.  In his video will he gives the family his all glass mansion.  They are excited and do to check it out.

1668052,4,B00005UQ9W,"... it was a surprisingly decent movie, with a bad ending. I have never liked it when people said ""you've seen one haunted house flick, you've seen them all"" cause the fact it, though haunted house flicks are similar they deserved to be examined on thier own level. Besides, your obviously interested enough to look it up, so you'll probably at least rent it. Remeber, I'm not writing to deterr your intrest, nor encourage it, I'm just relaying some good, and bad points of the film.
The movie starts with a solid concept: thare are 12 ghosts, each corresponding to a sign in the ""Black Zodiac"" (and while that idea is cool, the black zodiac is compleatly fake, for those of you who have seen the film and were wondering), these ghosts' energys are required to run a machine called the ""Occularis de Inferno"" or ""The Eye of Hell"" which is a device that can see through time and other such goodies. Thare is a failsafe, which is the 13th ghost, the spirit that jumpstarts the Occularis, a human sacrifice of love (you are blatantly lied about this in the movie, and you have to figure it out for yourself, so I saved you some time). Now, if you give me a movie with that solid of a backround, I gonna want to know more about all the little facits of everything. That's why I liked the DVD, you can go check out the life history of each ghost. Many of the spirits did not get equal time on screen. If each of these ghosts are so important you should spend some time with each. Out of all 12 ghosts, only 4 receved ample screen time: ""The Angry Princess"" (the first ghost to be released), ""The Juggarnaut"" (you see him being captured in the opening), ""The Jackal"" (by far the nastiest ghost out of any), and ""The Hammer"".
This machine that I mentioned before, the Occularis, takes the form of the house. It is of breathtakingly beautiful design. It is made of mostly glass with latin containment spells written in them, I would like to commend the designer. With both blazingly bright rooms and unsettlingly dark ones, it makes for a nice contrast.
Dispite all that this movie had going for it, it fell short in exicution and simply fell apart at the end. As far as directing and editing, the ghosts were handled superbly, seeing only flashes of them at times (I'm referring especally to and attack on Shannon Elizabeth by The Jackal, one of the good frights in the movie), but the other scenes between the living actors was very standard and sterile.
Is this the best haunted house flick ever? Not by longshot, but it does put more behind it that most cookie-cutter horror flicks, and for that it deserves a little recognition. Belive me, you'll be praising it when ""Jason X"" comes out.",1018656000,5,2684,4.513347022587269

Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Is it a great movie?. God no. Is it fun?. Oh yeah. I found myself enjoying the movie. Former ""Wings"" co-star Tony Shalhoub and his family, including red hot Shannon Elizabeth as his daughter, his little son, and a cliched black nanny, inherit his recently deceased Uncle Cyrus' weird house made entirely of glass. It appears that the uncle collected ghosts and has them locked up in containment cells in the basement. Well, naturally, something happens and the ghosts are set free. Our new owners are locked in the house and must battle the ghosties. The catch is that you can only see them when wearing these special glasses. I won't delve too much into what happens so as not too ruin it for anybody who might see it. F. Murray Abraham co-stars as Uncle Cyrus. Mr. Abraham, have things been this bad since your oscar winning performance in ""Amadeus""?. This movie isn't going to set the cinema on fire, or overly impress most people, but it is solid entertainment. I was expecting to hate it after hearing other people, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. Matthew Lillard and his drool also appear. Is it just me or does he drool a lot?. He did in ""Scream"" and he does in here too. Shannon Elizabeth looks great, but her role is just a typical 'damsel in distress'thing. Rah Digga as the nanny was a horrible cliche. A black character as nothing better than a nanny. It gets worse folks. She is also there to chime in with the typical comical one liners at the most inopportune time. So stereotypical. This is 2002 you filmmakers. Can't we do something better with a character than that?!. I guess not. I do have to say that some of the ghosts were downright creepy. Even if you dislike the movie, you have to admit that the make-up was great, which it was, and that the ghosts were really good. They were. This is the only recent 're-make' of an old horror movie that I have liked. Sure I still dream of the old days when movies were scary without CGI and effects and were just meant to be scary, but this movie managed to have a little of both. The make-up was great and the ghosts themselves were eerie. A couple death scenes were quite cool too. The first 10 minutes or so were pretty interesting to watch. ""13 Ghosts"" is not a winner by any stretch of the imagination. No one is going to feel smarter after watching it. It's just entertainment and entertain it did. At least for me.

There are quite a few scenes in this movie that are so sterotypical it is almost sick, namely one towards the end of the movie where the babysitter is ""saving the day"" by messing around with dials in the control room of the house and if one listens carefully, the sounds she makes with the dials are that of a rap groove.  Really offensive!!  This is a really bad example of how shallow those in coorporate seats have become to racisim in our pop culture.

1668113,2,B00005UQ9W,"This movie has just one thing going for it. It has one of the neatest, coolest, trickiest sets [much of it computer generated to be sure] I've seen in awhile. After doing a little investigating, I think I found out why. It seems first-time director Steve Beck used to be a director of visual effects at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. He is credited with working on `The Hunt for Red October', `The Abyss' and `Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade'. I can close my eyes and still see the set designs for those movies, so I assume Mr. Beck is a quite talented artist. '13 Ghosts' strongly suggests he should have stayed with visuals.
The set I refer to is the house where the characters meet the ghosts. It's actually a huge machine built for the purpose of opening the gates of Hell. It's all steel and glass, pistons and pulleys, and elaborate revolving engines. This effect was enough for me to give the movie two stars instead of one.
The plot and the dialog are inane, and the actors look pained, possibly because this kind of movie is where Once Promising Actors go to die. Earlier in their careers, I was impressed by Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth and Embeth Davidtz, not to mention F. Murray Abraham. From `Amadeus' to THIS? Hopefully, all the leads will be resurrected soon. The dreadful script and tepid acting, however, are not what make '13 Ghosts' so awful. After all, horror movies are in a cinematic world of their own. You can't fairly apply the standards of most other genres to most of them. [Note: The schlock director and promoter William Castle, who directed the original '13 Ghosts', also produced the remarkable ""Rosemary's Baby"", a true exception to the rule.]
For a modern horror film to work, it needs to be one or more of the following things: It must be scary. It must be full of sick humor. It must successfully parody other horror movies. It must have a character we care about. It must have a memorable monster or fiend. It must have a sexy lead, most usually female, but sometimes male [""Interview With the Vampire""]. It must have a cool soundtrack.
'13 Ghosts' is none of these things. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Come to think of it, the actors rarely appear to be actually IN or ON that fabulous set. Maybe it was digitally added later.",1018051200,,2274,4.603448275862069
1668114,5,B00005UQ9W,"For some reason I loved this movie. I never had the pleasure of seeing the first one from way back when, I was really impressed with the ghosties and such. I liked the fact that some of the ghosts would interact with the people trapped in the house and others just popped up and stared. Because of that we were able to focus on the more scary of the ghosts and we weren't crunched with details for all of them. The plot itself was sort of on the weak side but the scares made up for that by making you forget that there wasn't much of anything else going on. I was jumping up more times than I can count and even pulled my turtleneck up around my nose once or twice too. To me, that was worth the price since it takes a little bit to make me blink!

1668115,1,B00005UQ9W,"As CSN&Y once introduced a song, ""this one starts out slow and then fizzles out altogether"". Hey, maybe I didn't get the quote right. Well, the movie-makers didn't get this right.
Forget the William Castle comparisons - isn't everything a copy of a previous idea these days anyway? Thirteen Ghosts (I refuse to use the stupid spelling, thanks) fails on its own lack of merit. Tony Shaloub (an underrated actor who does the best he can in this mess) leads an uninteresting collection of sidekick characters through a formulaic scare plot. There's the sexy but slightly ditzy daughter, the sassy but hip nanny (Rah Digga, whose presence here defines tokenism), the evil lawyer, the sugar-dosed kid brother who ALWAYS gets away from everyone, and worst, a scenery-chewing idiot (the always-irritating Matthew Lillard) who is supposed to link the story together. I was rooting for the ghosts to kill just about every one; I haven't seen characters this annoying since Shelley Duvall in The Shining.
The ghosts themselves are interesting, with decent makeup and masks, but were so over the top as to never generate real fear. When one character referenced the most evil ghost of all, it turned out to be as lame as the rest. The only star of the picture is the amazing house/machine/prison. If the re-writers put half the effort into the story that the set designer did into the house, this might have been mildly entertaining. While the puzzle-box contraption is well thought out and certainly complex (Hellraiser fans raise your hands), the series of narrow hallways in place of spooky rooms made this look more like a lethal game of Pac-Man than a haunted house story. Occasionally funny lines (the retort when someone asks where the lawyer went is priceless) but overall the dialogue is ridiculously sophomoric and unrealistic. Yes, I know this isn't a documentary, but Halloween III is Shakespeare compared to this drivel. I used to think Ghost Story was the most disappointing horror movie I had ever seen (great book, though!), but this one is worse.
The sound is good overall, with effects happening in back corners when needed, and the soundtrack is appropriately loud and crude for a slacker-era remake flick. There are decent extras on the DVD, including a ""making-of"" featurette and some back-story on each of the ghosts. The latter is a great idea; too bad none of the ghosts seemed to have a personality in the movie. If you must check this out, flip the couple of bucks to rent it. The only scary thing about Thirteen Ghosts is (boo!) paying eight bucks to see it in a theatre or (shudder!) twenty bucks to own it!

ya closer than most.
The CGI effect are masterfully blending with existing sets
and you'll find it hard to tell where it ends or begins.
The whole aspect of the house was unique and it is a 'must

line-up of the Ghost, I really dug the Jackel and thought
that he was a lot more threatening than the Heavy Metal
Spike-Head, and the Lurch/serial killer-Juggernaut...but
my favorite was the Beauty with the knife...She needs to

They had the good idea (well actually they ripped that off from the original), but reworking that script wasn't a bad idea. However, they didn't pull it off too well. The acting wasn't too bad for the actors that were in it. Shannon Elizabeth has obviously never ben known for immense acting talent and Matthew Lillard who comes off ok for a psycho. The thing I hated most about this movie was that they never went in depth about anything. We got to see about 20 feet of the house before hell started to break loose, and barely any time is spent on charcter development at all. (i.e. the woman that shows up 3/4 through the movie already in the house) Could have been done much better!
The good things: The reason I gave this any stars was because the special effects on the ghosts were pretty entertaining. That woman with a box on her head was the best. Creepy and silly at the same time. Also, the twist at the end comes as kind of a surprise, it's not that it's that ridiculously surprising, it's just that you don't really think it's the kind of movie that would have a twist like that.

1668133,3,B00005UQ9W,"I went in the theatre with high hopes. I watched it. And I left feeling satisfied. This is a great movie, but that isn't to say that it is without its flaws.
First off, this movie is way too similar to the previous movie by Dark Castle Entertainment, House on Haunted Hill. Here are a few examples.
- Both have a slightly (initially) crazed, pessimistic, comic-relief character
who knows the ropes around the house. This was Watson Pritchett in House on
Haunted Hill, and Dennis Rafkin in 13 Ghosts.
- Both have basements. In both versions, when the main characters first go
into the basement, they get a shock. Both have henchmen of the crazy
millionaire who die in the basement (the mantainence guy in House on Haunted
Hill, and the lawyer guy in 13 Ghosts.
- Both start off with music playing as we follow the main characters initial
arrival at the house. (While House on Haunted Hill had a very cool, very
memorable scene with Marilyn Manson's rendition of 'Sweet Dreams are Made of
These', 13 Ghosts unfortunately seems to attempt to capture the spirit of
the previous outing in an almost parody of itself as we hear weird pop music
playing, seemingly slightly out of place.
In my personal opinion, Dark Castle's first film far surpassed the much inferior 13 Ghosts, though I no doubt found myself grinning madly through most of the film. The script seems rather weak and jokes quite lame, but this is no reason to miss the film. Don't go in expecting a Citizen Kane, but do expect a pretty good B-Movie rendition. P.s.

However, I can assure you that it is well worth the twenty dollars that Amazon.com is charging for it.

And with that being said, I'll gladly admit that I enjoyed every minute of it, and that I am anxiously anticipating any future releases from Dark Castle Entertainment or director Steve Beck.
""Thir13en Ghosts"" was a great deal more than I expected it to be (seeing that I was let down tremendously by how unfrightening ""House on Haunted Hill"" was).

And I was amazed at how many times I literally dropped my jaw and stared wide-eyed at the screen because of its stellar make-up effects, its stylish and unique production design, its fast pace, and some very convincing performances by Tony Shaloub and Mathew Lillard, who definitely steal the show and make this picture an extremely worthwhile experience.

Lack of a plot and lack of acting. But the greatest insult? That it carries the same name as the classic black and white movie.
Now I know people don't expect stellar acting out of a horror movie - and neither do I. I expect camp and a certain amount of bad acting, and even enjoy it (the words ""I KICK (...) FOR THE LORD!"" come to mind), but not to this extent.
A friend of mine told me that the main two actors are actually respected actors, and have done other movies well. If that really is the case, then I hope it was the directing, or something else that caused them to be so ultra-bad.
If it isn't intelligence-insulting stupid racial comments (""You white people are crazy"") that might appeal to the teens and pre-teens, it's the Scream guy's attempted deadpan imbecilic humor. The rating on this movie should not have been R - it should have been PG13, as I can't see how it would appeal to the older audience.
It's unfortunate that the trailer for this movie seemed so promising, that I couldn't pass up a chance to see it. And if you're like me, and were intrigued by the moving glass walls, and a promising plot, you're likely to regret every second afterwards.
Thirteen ghosts should be considered the Glitter of horror movies. Rent it, if you have to see what it's like. But avoid buying it like the plague.

Dr. Phil??"", but I swear, the next time I see a too-hip-for-the-room black character say something like ""I'm trapped in this house with some crazy white people!"", I'm gonna puke. Rah Digga (Even her NAME is irritating!) utters that tired line, and she also sings/raps/croaks out the closing title song. Yuck....that's the scariest part of the film! And just as a little aside- What is this supposedly dirt-poor family doing with a nanny? Why can't the daughter watch the morbid little boy? Don't ask questions, just accept....
 The effects are pretty good, and the Ghosts are truly original looking. (I'm particularly smitten with The Angry Princess played by Shawna Loyer...she's JUST....SO.....BEAUTIFUL!!) And Shannon Elizabeth is just as cute as ever.... F. Murray Abraham is effective, and even the always-annoying Matthew Lillard is tolerable. I wasn't scared, but I had fun.

1668208,4,B00005UQ9W,"""13 Ghosts"" is pretty good entertainment, tightly compacted into a little less than an hour and half, so the action doesn't slow down. The ""haunted"" house set is stunning as are the various gory ghosts...  Not much of a story but who cares. My only real complaint is with the bathroom scene with Shannon Elizabeth who is exploring the house early on in the action. She enters the spacious shower-room, admires the bath tub, lightly drips some water on her face..but never gets in the damn tub...c'mon in a horror/haunted house movie, there has to be at least one shower/nude scene...and don't tell me that just because the above scene also had the nude ghost in it that this condition is satisfied...a nude ghost with knife marks and blood all over her does not qualify....otherwise...good flick",1005177600,,795,4.845588235294118

Just a bunch of special effects injected around a nonsense plot.  The farther the movie progresses (regresses) the worse the story gets and the special effects are just flashbulb-popping botch jobs that'd induce an epileptic into seizures.
Bet you didn't know this was produced by tinseltown heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, did you?  Notice they're doing everything they can to disassociate themselves from this garbage.
Hollywood produced some real (...) this year, but even Bones was at least a watchable movie until it's ridiculous ending.  This movie is just awful from beginning to end.

1668211,2,B00005UQ9W,"Another swing and a miss from the people who brought us the dismal House on Haunted Hill.  Man with an unexplained wealth of capital resources hunts and captures spectres a la Ghost Busters.  Untimely demise results in estate being left to poor relatives. The ghosts, for as little as they are on screen and as little as we learn of them, are much more human than the poorly written cast, except for Matthew Lillard who is great as usual.  Tony Shalhoub as the father isn't even as half as compelling as he was in Galaxy Quest; Shannon Elizabeth is miscast as his daughter; and I prayed for the quick demise of Shalhoub's movie son, the annoying and forgettable Alec Roberts (nice stage name, btw), but unfortunately he survives until the end.  Hard to believe because his character acts so (...) the ghosts would have killed him in two seconds.  We are also treated to a stereotypical 'nannie' character, which doesn't make sense; isn't this a family on the edge of poverty?  Anyway, two interesting killings, one in the opening junkyard scene and one soon after the family take possession of the house, promise greatness that is never realized.  13 Ghosts is a lot of eye candy with no coherent story built around it; the ghosts behave inconsistently as do most of the characters.  Plot twists are never explained, and the most interesting characters, the ghosts, are hardly onscreen at all, with the exception of the gratuitous, buxom, topless ghost.  She really advanced the plot.  The finale is reminiscent of X-men, with a little Contact thrown in for good measure.  But it is a remake, so why be ashamed to borrow interesting visuals from other movies.  This movie is typical Hollywood (...), I give it a rating of 'Not So Money' on a scale of 'Hurting' to 'Bazilly'.  It WAS better than 'Jeepers Creepers' though.  The only reason I saw it is because the showtime was earlier than 'From Hell'.",1004918400,3,1901,4.738601823708207
1668212,4,B00005UQ9W,"I really did enjoy 13 Ghosts, but it seemed highly based on the independent film ""The Cube.""  It was nice to see a similar story brought into the realm of high-budget horror, but I think it would have been better done as an actual remake of Cube with big name actors.  The movie on it's own is quite good.  The suspense does sustain the entire movie, and I left the theater with bloodshot eyes from constantly keeping them open in suspense.  The only disappointment was the lack of nudity as far as Shannon Elizabeth is concerned.  I'm not a sexist, but it's become expected in a movie like this to see her nude.  I think most of the characters are compelling, but you never really feel like you are inside of the main character.  The people are a bit 2-dimensional.  This film was highly entertaining, but lacked the depth to become a classic.  If you are into real suspense, buy the movie Cube instead.",1004832000,,904,4.463414634146342

Despite what other people think, I think she is a great actress. Just because she plays a ditz in a couple movies (ok 3 or 4) doesn't mean she shouldn't get a chance in other movies. This was a good baby step away from the ditzy roles. (Jay and silent bob strikes back was another, kinda.) I hope she continues to make good movies because I really enjoy her and her acting.

1668216,1,B00005UQ9W,"When ""Josie and the Pussycats"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" were released earlier this year, I thought I'd been subjected to the most silly and contrived of the year's plots. After seeing ""13 Ghosts,"" I'm reconsidering that opinion. The film is a rehash of a 1960 camp classic by the same name, though I doubt that the word ""remake"" is justifiable.
The bare bones of the original plot are borrowed, giving the filmmakers room to add their own story structure and plot twists for a modern audience. What a shame, though, that this movie turns out to be little more than an insult to the intelligence of even the most open-minded audience members, not to mention a striking disappointment from Dark Castle Entertainment, whose previous ""House on Haunted Hill"" remake was more intense, more likeable, and far more interesting.
""13 Ghosts"" begins with a scene that could have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film, except to set us up for the surprise at the end. Here, a wealthy man named Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) busies himself searching an auto junkyard in search of a ghost, which he hopes to trap in a box and take back to his mansion. Of course, all hell breaks loose, and Cyrus is killed, leaving behind an expansive mansion and a highly unstable partner, Rafkin (""Scream's"" Matthew Lillard).
What a break for Cyrus's nephew, Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), who lives in squalor with his two children and a nanny (the movie's obligatory black character) after a fire destroyed his home and took his wife years ago. They get to the house and are immediately enraptured by it's walls, large panes of glass with intricate Latin phrases that become illuminated when a special pair of glasses is worn by the inhabitant. It's never made clear what these glasses are for: they are just there for the unsuspecting family to start seeing the ghosts that start permeating the house once the machine downstairs starts twisting and rolling, thanks to some less-than-effective special effects.
There are so many things that go wrong with the movie that its predecessor got right, one has to wonder if the screenwriters actually paid any attention to the original material. The glasses are a ripoff of the theater gimmick for the first movie (special viewers were given to the audience to allow them a choice of seeing the apparitions onscreen or not). Why the characters bother wearing them is beyond me: the audience is able to see the ghosts much of the time, diminishing any effect the movie may have had had we not been able to see what was going on, just as the characters do.
The panes of glass with Latin phrases... well, they turn out to be spells, spells which cannot be bypassed by those trapped in the world of the dead, ""whether spoken or written,"" as one character points out. It's a complete machination on the part of the writers, who throw this, that, and the other into the story whenever it looks like something might get remotely interesting. This provides a very funny scene, however, as Arthur and Rafkin venture into the basement to find the children, carrying a large pane of glass with them for protection.
The machine idea is the movie's most contrived, only serving to sink the plot lower into the depths of its own ludicrousness. Apparently, Cyrus collected certain ghosts that were needed to feed power to the machine once it reached its full velocity, therefore opening some eye of hell that would make him the most powerful man on Earth. Completely tongue-in-cheek dialogue for such explanations, though it's never funny, and never interesting or serving to advance the plot.
As the credits rolled after the obligatory loud and happy ending, I began pondering why ""13 Ghosts"" was indeed such a mess. ""House on Haunted Hill"" followed a similar strategy of reworking a classic horror movie, but with this film, there is no interest behind the rework. The plot has no energy, no logic, no sense of what it so desperately wants to be about, and the result is a muddled mess of gory bloodshed, ridiculous plot twists and long periods of boredom. One of the year's worst films.",1004745600,8,4092,4.789250353606789
1668237,4,B00005UQ9W,"Sure, a lot of critics hate this movie, but when are critics supposed to like horror movies.  My answer: Never.  So a good suggestion is to pay no attention to the critics and see the movie yourself, and then draw your own conclusion.  In my opinion, this was an awesome horror movie that keeps you guessing.
For a horror movie, the story was very complex.  The directing and acting was really good in the movie.  Especially Matthew Lillard's performance.  There are enough creepy ghosts and surprises that will get you hooked in no time.  If you liked, ""House on Haunted Hill,"" chances are that you will enjoy this movie as well, being that it was produced by the same people.  The audio and visual effects were incredible, and made the movie that more impressive.  Although all the flashing lights might give you a little bit of a headache; small price to pay, if you ask me.  My only complaint is that I think the movie could've been a little more scarier at certain parts.  Other than that, I thought it was great.
I'm not going to take the time to go over the movie's story, because you'll find out when you go see it.  The previews have been very careful about not giving anything away, so I will do the same.  Just know this; Poor family without a home + vengeful ghosts trapped in glass rooms in creepy mansion = one hell of a time!
This movie was not as good as ""House on Haunted Hill,"" but it was still a quality horror movie.  It was certainly a hell of a lot better than those ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movies.  Go ahead, and give the movie a try.  All in all, this was a great movie with cutting edge special effects and stomach-turning suspense.

I liked the ideas for the spells and such. The special effects were great in some parts, poor in others. I wasn't a big fan of the jerky sped-up scenes where the ghosts were chasing the charecters. It just seemed poorly done. A few times you could tell where a portion was cut out of the movie, like a bad transition from one part to another.. like in a book ending a chapter and staring a new one mid sentence. Some of the charecter development was rather weak. Especially the ""ghost freedom fighter"" girl. The scene towards the end when the main charecter figures out the truth about the bad guy was a little lame. All in all I guess you can criticize every film even if you enjoyed it or not and i did enjoy this one.

They used some good cinematography of the house added with some creepy music and long drawn camera shots (ala Halloween) but this movie isn't as scary, or gory as the trailers and commericals say. The ghosts are the best part of this movie and for once i actually like Lillard in a movie, his character was actually pretty cool.

(. . . ) the direction in this film is awful.  I compare it to the direction in ""HouseGuest"" with Sinbad.  What's the comparison?  The fact that the camera angle changes every freakin' second.  This gave me such a headache, although it was cool while the ghosts were in sight, since they helped to draw away from the constant scene changes, it also made it hard to get a real look at the ghosts.  And about the ghosts here, why couldn't they have given a little more information about the ghosts before we actually show them.  It's like we see the ghosts, who are visually explainable, and then we are given an explanation.  Plus it seems that half the time only one or two ghosts are really having any impact on the movie at all, the others are just there to count as a number.  Getting back to the directing at hand, I would now have to go off on what was in the director's mind.  It's like he was trying to make a scene that had no reason in being scary at all seem scary.  Like when the family is babbling about their apartment and then a lawyer is shown walking down the hallway extremely slowly.  Why is he walking so slow?  Don't ask me.

A couple of the effects weren't too bad when the spirits were stuck behind glass walls. Some of them were pretty scary looking, but I wasn't very scared watching it. I was actually irritated every time there was a flash (mostly when the characters had the ""special glasses"" on) my eyes are pretty sensitive and it burned when I saw the white light, which was pretty often.
I'm not into ""Hollywood"" movies that cater to the public anyway, but you know its bad when they have such stupid humor like ""I'm stuck in a house with a bunch of crazy white folks."" Or use someone like Shannon Elizabeth who can't be taken seriously as an actress anyway. Most of the movie has the characters chasing each other around a glass house, running away from spirits who can't get past the glass walls because of the ""entrapment spells"" or whatever.
