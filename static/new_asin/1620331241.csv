I've had the circular attachment for various machines I've had over the years and have never been able to get it to work properly. After watching this video only once-I was on my way. This is an excellent tutorial and a really fun quilt to make. I have two of these in progress now. Very inspiring and a visual treat with all the vivid colours.",1440547200,2,423,4.108433734939759
