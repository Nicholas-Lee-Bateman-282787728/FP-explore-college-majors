8440201,1,B004SS8KW0,"Hi, I have waited for ""One Million B.C."" for quite a while. I still like the movie but the DVD was a disappointment. The picture quality was so poor I could not recognize some of the actors. It was washed out and the faces were blurred. The second film ""Wild Women..."" was much better but I have no interest in it. It also had some stupid political slams in the ""previews"". Hopefully ""One Million B.C."" will be released in a better print. Save your money and wait for a better print.",1360713600,5,483,4.318681318681318

8440203,3,B004SS8KW0,"I am only giving this a low rating becouse the quality of the film. It is poor. But having said that, it is the only game in town. I have wanted this movie for years. I got tired of waiting for a restored version. I wanted one million bc, not the other one. I did not even watch the other one. I loved one million.  The acting is great and I love the story. This is one that deserves to be restored and put out in better condition.",1340064000,3,431,3.897727272727273
8440204,3,B004SS8KW0,"The picture quality is very poor, which is almost understandable for One Million BC (aka Man and his Mate in the UK) but less so for the much later Wild Women of Wonga. The former is a reasonable film and Carole Landis is hot. The latter fails on all levels: plot; screenplay; acting; special effects - just occasionally it is so bad it is funny but mainly it is just dire. Mercifully my copy of the DVD started to break up but unfortunately it came back.",1321401600,,455,4.3023255813953485
