7812685,4,6301576128,"This tape is a good look at individual Corvette's from 1953 - 1989. The  first Corvette made it's debuted on June 30, 1953 for only $3,500, this  tape has the first black & white commercial advert on this car.
The  tape is only 30 minutes long, which I thought was a bit short, but it is  worth having in your collection.  It gives buyers a good look through each  model specifications, and what has been added to each car through this  period.
Sit back and have a look through the best car ever made....  CORVETTE.",968112000,8,515,4.347368421052631
