3006229,5,B000XT8KFK,I bought this video for a friend who works with autistic kids in the local school system.  She is very pleased with the quality of the video and the valuable and easy to understand information in it for parents.  She is encouraging all of them to buy their own personal copy to help them work with their children at home.  They can reinforce the things the OT is working with their children at school and have fun doing it.,1196985600,3,423,4.329113924050633
3006230,5,B000XT8KFK,The video is beautifully produced and flows nicely.  Lots of information for parents about many different aspects of their child and OT.  It was great to see a variety of kids in the video all working together.  Helpful ideas to try at home were also included.,1196899200,3,260,4.608695652173913

8229562,4,B000XT8KFK,good basic introduction to how OT helps kiddos on the spectrum...,1475539200,,65,5.0
8229563,4,B000XT8KFK,"I found this to be a great addition to my OT lending library. Since the video is divided into segments (one for each sensory system addressed), it makes it easy for busy parents to watch (and process/absorb) in small increments. Britt Collins speaks clearly, slowly, and in terms that can be grasped by parents.",1360800000,,311,4.777777777777778
8229564,1,B000XT8KFK,"While Ms Brett seems to have a good intent in providing parents with ""exercises"" for their autistic kids, this DVD does not at all represent what it claims to represent. The author obviously attempted to get the full range of catchy terms in the description of her product (e.g., sensory integration, ABA, reprogramming). At least in my area of expertise - sensory integration - the book cannot fulfill these expectations. Recipe-like activites are shown which do not at all reflect the ideas of Sensory Integration, i.e. enhanced sensory information specifically targeted at particular hypothesized dysfunctions of sensory processing and integration as assessed by a specially qualified occupational therapist. Sensory Integration neither works with ""exercises"" nor on ""desentisizing"". It rather supports the child's brain's ability to modulate, process and integrate the sensory input to use it for purposeful activity. While sensory strategies can be applied in the child's daily life, this is not ""sensory integration"" and should not be done according to recipes and exercises.",1330214400,,1081,5.597560975609756
8229565,5,B000XT8KFK,"This is the first DVD I have ever seen that I wrote to the people to tell them  YOU MADE ME CRY. WHAT A help this DVD was and IS. I put it in quite a bit.. To help our Occupation Thearpy in our HOME time. My son is in major need of his ot time every day! and this DVD made me so happy to know I AM NOT ALONE! I have somebody that understands me! they made this FOR ME! I now they did not but I feel they did. WHAT amazing help it has been. I love all the DVD's and I HOPE they make more! I will be first in line! And I will bring about 5 friends! I know if you see this DVD. You will be telling a friend, Family member and PLEASE TELL A TEACHER!
Their is help for our kids. THIS is the first step!",1226793600,,697,3.5555555555555554
8229566,5,B000XT8KFK,"Autistic kids have sensitivity issues (textures can bother them, for example) and other special-needs kids have problems with proprioception (knowing where your limbs are), balance, and other movement issues. This dvd has exercises based on Occupational Therapy to guide a parent to help a child build skills. The skills literally can reprogram the brain (by moving, the brain is rewired.)

This dvd is suggested for kids 2 1/2 years old and older. It covers:

Gravitational insecurity
Motor Planning
Vestibular dysfunction
Proprioception dysfunction
Tactile dysfunction
Oral Motor
Visual Motor
Organization of Behavior

If you have a special-needs child, this could be a very valuable way to interact and build skills.",1211846400,9,719,5.577981651376147
8229567,4,B000XT8KFK,"This DVD is very helpful to me as I learn more about my son's sensory/regulatory issues. I've purchased and learned from many books on this subject, and many contain great information, but reading about a physical activity like OT is not the best way to understand it. Having an experienced OT demonstrate (and explain) various activities has been incredibly useful.

Initially, the DVD helped me understand my son's experience better and try a few things while I waited for a slot in an OT clinic. Now that we are working with an OT, I still refer to the DVD. Our OT spends most of her time working with my son, rather than educating me...being able to refer to this DVD has been enormously helpful. I'm really excited about any tool that can help me support my son's growth...and this DVD does just that!",1211673600,,806,4.636363636363637
8229568,5,B000XT8KFK,"I am not parent of a child with Autism, but I do have a dear friend and her son has Autism. I actually found this program because I bought a Yoga DVD that this company puts out and I saw an ad for it at the beginning.

My friend and her husband have tried everything they can find to better their son's life, so I thought it would be a nice gesture.

I am happy to say that he can't get enough of it. He's 11 years old and rather severe so he's afraid to try any of the activities, but he likes woman teaching the program and asks his mother to play it over and over again.

It's her dream that they will get him to do some of the activities, and watching his fascination has her excited that he will. His own Occupational Therapy Provider is also very happy about his response and believes it can really help.

In addition, as a friend, with his great response I decided to watch it with him, more to watch him than anything. What I found is that it was great for me too. I learned so much about the various things children with Autism go through and what parents and friends can do to help. It honestly made me more comfortable with this young man and I've known him his entire life.

I know this is a bit of a candid review and I'm usually more structured and professional, but I'm not writing this as a reviewer so much as a woman who has a special needs child in her extended family. I can't say enough about what this DVD is doing for all of us and I thank the creators for making it something an outsider can understand.",1207958400,4,1527,4.093645484949833
8229569,3,B000XT8KFK,"As an OT I bought this in hope of getting a DVD to share with parents for education and examples of treatment for sensory issues. It does show common approaches and offers some explanation of what certain activities can provide.  However, for parents it may be a bit obscure and doesn't provide enough info to allow parents to carry out at-home activities.",1206403200,3,356,4.741935483870968
8229570,5,B000XT8KFK,"Although I don't personally know children with autism or special needs, I have a number of friends who have children or grandchildren who are affected.  Britt's DVD presents a wide variety of activities to do with children, she explains the purpose of each one, and she gives clear directions and encouragement to the children as they participate.  Throughout the activities, Britt demonstrates awareness of the children and their feelings as well as a cognizance of safety through putting a hand out to support and reassure the children as they follow her instructions.  I've been telling everyone I know about the video, and all the feedback to me has been positive.",1202947200,2,668,5.054545454545455
8229571,5,B000XT8KFK,"This DVD offers information helpful to parents and those interacting with children having a difficult time functioning in a variety of enviornments including school and home. Britt Collins offers detailed explanations with easy to follow interventions for everyday use. As an Occupational Therapist, I would recommend this DVD to parents as a reference for strategies to increase their child's participation in daily activities.",1197590400,2,428,5.809523809523809
