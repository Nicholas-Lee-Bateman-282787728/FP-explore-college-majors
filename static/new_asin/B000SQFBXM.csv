The acting and characterization are superb at evoking emotion and sparking the viewer's interest. At no point was I bored or doubting the character's actions. The direction is also unappoligetically experimental and exotic; the black and white scenes are utilized to denote a sense of glamor that I didn't think was possible. I've never seen cinematography done that way and to such good effect. There's also a lot of (black?) humor that adds a welcome touch to the unique storyline.

Part of what I think a lot of people are missing about this movie is that this is really a drama. Not an action flict. Not a ""suspense mystery."" Don't listen to people who put this film down, because it's likely they don't care for experimental directing or the sort of emo, new-wave digression from opposition. If you didn't get films like Beautiful Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, then you're not going to understand this movie or enjoy it. This is very much an arty excursion.

Not to say it doesn't have a great deal of realism. The characters and the situations they encounter are believable. Like the scene with the masocistic frenchman--priceless! You can see the unease on the translator's face and hear it in her voice. Then there are the scenes involving the assassine and her old schoolmate. The bi-curious tension between the two is definately visible--and is later revealed explictly in a more dramatic scene.

Bottom line: if you like a deep, romantic drama with an edgy twist to it, then look into ""Court of Lonely Royals."" In this movie, there are no heroes, but believable characters who flutter nonchalantly between the lines of good and bad.",1196208000,4,1873,4.84375
