8749040,4,B01B1XA11C,"Very good movie filmed on a low budget in Northern Michigan. Outstanding video quality, that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie did not get enough exposure at the box office. Based on an adult thriller novel by writter Chrstopher Knight. I'm not a huge fan of scary movies, but this is a well done film which is billed as a thriller. Very fitting.",1498521600,,363,4.352941176470588
