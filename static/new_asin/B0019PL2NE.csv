8275001,5,B0019PL2NE,"I purchased this dvd along with mis primeras palabras (which is from the same producers) The dvd is great. Its about 30min long. Its entertaining and my kids are starting to be able to say more of the alphabet letters. Basically its a womans voice reading out the abcs one by one along with an item that begings with that letter example: ""A"" la letra A es pare avion.. Then they will show an air plane.",1359590400,,402,4.302631578947368
