1400550,3,B000056MMA,"I had pretty high expectations of this ninja/horror flick, and it didn't quite meet them. Animation is clearly a bit aged in this one, but its decent enough. There is one very awesome battle scene in the beginning that got me excited to watch further, but unfortunately the rest are kind of weak. However, I've never seen an anime quite like this mixing zombies with ninjas. The whole film is extremely dark and eerie, and the story kind of drags along but keeps you a bit interested. Compared to titles like Ninja Scroll or the infamous Samurai X (Rurouni Kenshin in Japan), this is no match. Then again, it was made before Ninja Scroll, but all in all the title is decent to rent, but not purchase especially at the hefty price they put on it.",989884800,2,745,4.485294117647059
1400551,5,B000056MMA,"I love Japanimations, and this is one of my favorite! The storyline is very good... You can find suspens, action and romance as well.  The main caracter isn't a perfect Barby doll, and seem to be human with qualities and weakness!  The soundtrack is excellent.  Every images is very detailed and there are also a great deal of violence but not useless! This is a must have for every fan of japenese animations!",982108800,,410,4.589041095890411
1400552,5,B000056MMA,"i saw this movie ages ago and have been searching for it since, finally found and rented it on netflix and plan to buy it on amazon.  i can't say why i like this movie so much, the anime isn't so hot, i think it's mainly the story.",1203120000,,231,3.8125
1400553,5,B000056MMA,"Not perfect but, great mystery surrounds the whole movie because the Yoma are never fully explained. There could have been more conflict and fighting; this is no Vampire Hunter D or Ninja Scroll. The artwork is beautiful and the Yoma themselves are interesting, taking the forms of regular animals on earth and still containing their supernatural abilities.",1124928000,3,357,5.280701754385965
1400554,1,B000056MMA,This movie blows.  2 episodes only - which will leave you uncertain about where this is going and where it all began.,1122854400,2,117,4.318181818181818
1400555,4,B000056MMA,"This is some old anime, 1989 to be exact.  So when people bellyache about it not being up to snuff technically, then there's why.  If you judge it by other anime of that period, then it holds up just fine.
The story is meant to be moody and semi-cryptic (imagine that!  cryptic anime!) and when I watched it at about 3AM it genuinely weirded me out.  There is much deceit and decadence, and the traditionally clueless main character, questing though he's not quite sure why or how.
Surely this is no Ninja Scroll or Samurai X (Rurouni Kenshin), the storytelling aspect is not nearly as well done.  But on a more basic level of horror and intrigue, it succeeds well.  I think it all depends on what you're expecting when you first view the film.  Don't approach Blood Reign thinking you're in for the second coming of Akira and you will be pleased.  But it certainly is not for kids, unless you want your kids watching ground-dwelling beasts emerge up through the bloody corpses of freshly killed drunken thieves.",1021939200,15,1012,4.614525139664805
1400556,4,B000056MMA,"Contrary to what other people say, the animation is quite lovely. People are comparing it to modern standards, so of course it is not up to par if you look at it like that, but for it's time, the animation is superb.
The storyline, while not as developed as many other animes I have seen (Evangelion, Love Hina, etc), was enough to keep me interested so that I have watched it a few times over. Also, contrary to what some other people have said, the story is not confusing whatsoever.
So if you are interested in seeing more action then story, then pick this one up. But, if you want massly developed characters and intrigue, this isn't for you.",1012608000,9,646,4.436974789915967
1400557,1,B000056MMA,"This movie was the first one to teach me that once a film is transfered to the DVD format, it's picture quality doesn't necessarily have to be remastered to cause a more enjoyable viewing. Thus, it seems that it has the same picture quallity as the VHS version. Now, as for the plot, it is just as simple as boring, the main character goes on a stupid quest to search and destroy his former youth comrade who has turned evil, but no one bothers to tell us when or why' for the story begins from the middle of something. The hero's quest itself is boring and slow, and at most of it's parts not understandable. Last, the monsters in the movie are pretty stupid (flesh eating horse?!) and the fact that the entire movie consist of two seperate episodes makes this film to look as unworthy and a waste of money. I baught the movie in France and was fooled by the plot summary on it's back to think that it's a good adventure anime.",1007078400,4,928,4.308571428571429
1400558,1,B000056MMA,"As in all things there are good and there are bad.  Anime is no exception, while i've seen some great anime with unique stories, adult plots, and cutting edge animation I'd have to say without a doubt Blood Reign is the worst by far.  Think Titan A.E. without the pretty artistry to look at and you've got Blood Reign.  I watched about 2/3 of it and could discern no plot whatsover.  Rather this is a collection of scenes that are pieced together in hopes that a coherent story would come out.  The director must think that no one has the attention span of over 3 minutes because that about how long each disjointed piece of drivel lasts.  I rank this a one, only because I can't rank it any lower.  Ghost is a shell was far and away better than this tripe and that's not a compliment.  I thought about trying to sell this to someone to recoup some of my loss, but I just couldn't bring myself to pass this piece of misery onto anyone else.  Rather I'll take it out to the back yard later this evening and burn it.  All the while praying I never run across something as horrible as this again.  If you want good anime get Record of Lodoss war, or Princess Mononoke, but for the love of all that's holy stay away from this disgrace.",1006214400,2,1231,4.262931034482759
1400559,4,B000056MMA,"I have an addition to make. My erlier review was on the original,
japanese version of yoma. Lately i watched the english version and now i want to tell all of you who read this - DON'T watch the syncronized version ! Even though you might not like watching movies with subtitles but this pictures loses A LOT in it's translated state.
The cute squeekish voice of Aya has turned into an average female anime girl voice, the yoma sound as if they have no lust in preying on the humans anymore - in short words - the whole vocal cast is totally messed up. Alone the way they speak out the name of the main person, Hikage (which they do a lot in the flic) is a pain to the ears. Plus they ruined the atmosphere of the movie's best parts by adding some additional sound effects which don't fit at all.
This shows how much a good voice acting can give to a movie or take from it.
Watch this movie with japanese audio and english subtitles (most of you are not familiar with japanese i guess), you won't regret it !",1000944000,3,1008,4.201030927835052
1400560,3,B000056MMA,"It's obvious that the creators of this anime were trying hard to achieve something, but it obviously lacks the polish to achieve their intentions.
To begin with, the animation is definitely aged.  It's not awful, but there are points at which I think the animation falls to sub-standard quality.  There's an overall creepiness that the animators gave to the movie, but it doesn't serve to do much.  Story-wise, this movie is lacking.  They try hard to weave a decent story, but lack of character development and just a simple lack of direction hinders what could have been a very good plot.  You never seem to care for the characters as much as you should.  There are also some cliche moments throughout the movie.  The music is rather forgettable.  I watched the subbed version and the voice acting was decent.
Still, despite it's numerous flaws, this movie does have an underlying quality to it.  Had this movie been developed in plot and overall cinematics, it could have been much better.  As it is, it's an average movie that I can't really recommend unless you're just a serious anime fan.",991267200,3,1095,4.776595744680851

7932653,3,B000056MMA,"This late-80s 2-part OVA was probably one of the first horror anime to be released in English. Originally released in subtitled VHS as Curse Of The Undead Yoma, it was later re-released on dubbed VHS and DVD as Blood Reign: Curse Of The Yoma. Adapted from the short-lived manga series Yoma by Sengoku Nights creator Kei Kusunoki, this was first billed as ""ninjas vs. zombies"" years before zombies were made popular again thanks to the Dawn Of The Dead remake.

 Set in feudal Japan, a young skilled ninja named Hikage is charged with tracking down his childhood friend/fellow ninja Marou who has deserted his clan and is feared to leak the death of their leader who was killed by yoma which are Japanese demons. Hikage's quest leads him to a village inhabited by stragglers and derelicts. All its inhabitants are really sacrifices for the yoma, and grizzly giant spiders harvest them for their leader, who turns out to be Marou, that is really a yoma himself apparently born from the ground itself. Marou escapes, and then the next episode takes place two years later with Hikage still on his trail. This has Hikage getting into a feudal war between the yoma clans and his ninja clan, facing all matter of beasts and monsters. Everything from flesh-eating horses, wolf-taurs, butterfly-women, giant snakes, and other video game bosses that even Ash from Evil Dead say ""Screw this! I'm going home!""

 Toho handled this animation for this, and for a late-80s production it actually is pretty damn good. There is some serious full-scale gore in store for anyone who wants just a good slasher flick, and they don't skip on the details during the disemboweling. This also makes for a great ninja story too, not Ninja Scroll mind you, but a close second. The dub is pretty stale though, so you might wanna just watch it in Japanese.",1383004800,,1826,4.787301587301587
7932654,5,B000056MMA,"It's grenade toting ninjas fighting demons in futile Japan! WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT IT?! Ok. It's only 2 episodes long resulting in ton of plot holes, but hey the action more than makes up for it. The background music is also cool. It's got that old school Castlevania feel to it. Also I swear the Counting Song reminds me of the Freddy Krueger song. I can't be the obly one who thought about a Nightmare on Elm Street when they first heard it.",1361318400,,445,4.309523809523809
7932655,4,B000056MMA,"If you love Ninja scroll and ninja films in general!!!!  WATCH THIS STUFF !
Animation is old but cool, it's dramatic, good acting, very good visuals, it's an eye candy at moments,, it's brutal, bloody, intresting and has a lot of drama in it, it's also Sad with tragic characters.

from start to finish this movie is a delight,
NOT as good as ninja scroll, but very good fantasy Anime. and there is a lot of FANTASY in this ninja film.

if you love old school (ninja scroll, ghost in the shell, demon city) anime, this is for you.

NOT CUTE, NOT FUNNY NOT FOR LITTLE BARBIE DOLL LOVEING GIRLS!
it's for anime fans!
Hurrah",1348099200,,621,4.373913043478261
7932656,5,B000056MMA,"Not perfect but, great mystery surounds the whole movie because the Yoma are never fully explained. There could have been more conflict and fighting. The artwork is beautiful and the Yoma themselves are interesting, taking the forms of regular animals on earth and still containing their supernatural abilities. It is also very sad in away that how friends can become mortal enemys and how almost everything comes full circle.

This is a Ninja Anime of the late 80's era of anime it is also a type of Horor Anime. The animation even to todays standards is done well IMO and the voice acting adds abit more darkness to it.

This is a Movie in two 40-45 min parts.

This dose earn it's TV MA Rating it is Violent, it is gory, it dose have some brief nudity and it can be very scary to children so avoid alowing them to watch.",1325030400,,823,4.437086092715232
7932657,5,B000056MMA,"Love this one. The things that make me really enjoy this one is the dark tone and colors of the movie, creepy music, awesome demon character designs, and the main character, a crazy ninja with some cool weapons. It's not perfect, the characters are kind of bland in terms of personality, and the story may be confusing but I was easily able to overlook these slights. As I said before there are some really interesting looking demons in this movie so if your a fan of the demons and art style in movies like wicked city, demon city shinjuku, or vampire hunter D(original) chances are you might enjoy this one. So to sum it up, awesome wicked-city-esk art style and demons, some bloody action, a bad ass hero with cool ninja weapons and some creepy music that goes well with the movie. If you like these types of things, you may enjoy this one. If not and your looking for an intricate plot with well developed characters maybe you should look elsewhere. However because these things appeal to me enough to have watched at least 5 times, I'm going to give it 5 stars ;)
Also if you liked this one and are a fan of horror-fantasy, here are some recommendations to help you out. Most of which can be found here on Amazon.

Battle Angel Alita OVA - Similar art style and violence though its more like a horror sci-fi with robots and cyborgs instead of demons. If you liked it be sure to check out the manga.
Vampire Hunter D(original) - The newer blood lust is good too but I actually prefer the original as it has a decidedly holloween-ish art style, better music, happier ending, and I feel it has more character development.
Wicked City - Messed up movie. Lots of demon sex and violence, again similar art style and a cool twist at the end
Demon City Shinjuku - again similar art style, demons ya da ya da check it out
Devilman - simply awesome
Pet Shop of Horrors

7932658,5,B000056MMA,"My first experience with this anime was back in the late 90's when I was still very young. This was back when they started showing ova's on cinimax late nights. It wasn't my first exposher to anime by any means, but it was the first anime that had seen that I  would call horror. I wouldn't call it scary, but it has very dark and dramatic feel, with great synth music. I don't think this could have made any better with the what they had to work with considering this anime is over 20 years old. The animation is hand drawn not computer generated, so some people would probably call it dated, but I actually prefer the old drawing style's. If you like 80's horror movies, or really action packed animes, you would most likely enjoy blood reign. It's a true old school gem that should not be over looked.",1264118400,,804,4.36
