8305310,5,B001GG7D7K,"I really enjoyed this presentation.  The history of what is being uncovered everyday at Pompeii is truly amazing.  Part drama with flash backs to the few last days of the city and a select group of people that the viewer becomes emotionally attached to.  The science part was truly fascinating, from the volcano itself, to the artifacts, bodies and bones of what remained from that last few days of the three towns that were buried.  Many people escaped the tragedy, the ones who stayed past the first two days did not or could not leave,  but what was left has truly enriched our knowledge of the past. From ordinary people, wealthy people, their homes, their pets, their food, even what plants they preferred in their gardens.......truly a day of tragedy and fear frozen in time.",1397520000,,781,4.7555555555555555
8305311,5,B001GG7D7K,"The show seems to be in two parts.  The first part is really a break down, hour by hour, of the stages of the death of Pompeii and many of the towns and cities around it.  They use hard facts, with some details about daily life, to give us a wonderful, tragic, colorful picture of the last moments of this once proud, rich city of the Roman world.
The second part focuses on the science of how we know what happened two thousand years ago, what we know now, and what may happen in the future.  We're talking maybe a million people dead and twice that many displaced or hurt.
Amazing how brave, or stupid, modern humans can be.  To live in Pompeii and dismiss the dangers.  The show is not just about Pompeii, it is about human nature.",1287792000,8,734,4.251798561151079
8305312,5,B001GG7D7K,"Based on the archeological findings at Pompeii, this is a supposition of what that final day was like in the lives of a few of the citizens.  This wasn't the average dry recitation of facts.  The film makers give faces and personalities to the figures left in the ash. Very poignant.",1236124800,14,283,4.529411764705882
