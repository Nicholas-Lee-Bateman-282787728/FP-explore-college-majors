8027897,5,B0002GFTQ2,"Cold Squad is in my humble opinion one of the two best TV crime series ever aired -- the other, also set in Vancouver, is DaVinci's Inquest. Each episode of each is the quivalent of a superior, in-the-theaters, movie -- but in less than an hour.  It is incredible to me that all the episodes of each are not available on DVD.  These two series -- together with NCIS, Criminal Minds, and NUMB3RS -- constitute a Golden Age of television drama.",1241654400,8,442,4.444444444444445
8027898,5,B0002GFTQ2,"This Canadian show was obviously the blueprint for the current American show Cold Case--they've even borrowed from the theme song.  Cold Case is good, but Cold Squad is great--the acting, the writing, the stories.  Don't miss this taut, intense show.",1207353600,21,250,5.225
