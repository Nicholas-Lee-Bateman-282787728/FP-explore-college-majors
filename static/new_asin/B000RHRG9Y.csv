8413729,5,B000RHRG9Y,"I loved the first two Rozen Maiden DVDs, and I loved this one as well. I have watched it through three times already. The scene in which the Rozen Maidens, Jun, and Nori act out the tale of Snow White is priceless (Hina ichigo: ""There's not really seven of us, but we're the seven dwarves."") The DVD is worth buying for that alone.",1191024000,2,331,4.26984126984127
