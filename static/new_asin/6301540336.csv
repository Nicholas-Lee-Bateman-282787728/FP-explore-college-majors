332233,5,6301540336,"Accotone is an interesting film because Pasolini exposes to his audience a particular lifestyle and social class which would not be accurately touched on in an American picture. If Hollywood had ever discussed Accotone's subject matter they would display it with all its stereotypical adornments and falsities which most US moviegoers are accustomed to. Pasolini is not afraid to present the grittier side of the subproletariat as is epitomized in the film's main character, Accotone, who struggles with his profession of pimping and becoming more sensitive to his women and to the world. Pasolini's debut is delicately permeated with political concepts and allegories, yet we can see that he is experimenting newly with the technique of film and developing a filmic narrative structure; more of his full-fledged sociopolitical allegories would be pursued in films like The Gospel and Hawks and Sparrows. The film stars Franco Citti who at the time of making of the film was a nonprofessional. However his performance is substantial considering him being a novice and having his voice overdubbed by another actor. Citti would soon become a Pasolini regular, starring in Oedipus Rex, Arabian Nights, and other supporting roles. However, as the film progresses the attention is centered on the female lead, who plays the naive soon-to-be callous farm worker who is duped by Accatone into prostitution. Before Pasolini ventured into the cinema he had a knack for writing. In his first two novels Pasolini had utilized the language of his mother's homeland, Friuli, for colloquial discourse amongst his characters who lived in subproletariat communities. It is not surprising that the subject of these novels would be the focal point of Accatone. In addition I believe Pasolini had rendered his ideas (from his literature) appropriately for his film, yet not becoming to carried away with fidelity and technical aspects which are profuse in films today. Accotone is worth a look for film buffs and people who appreciate arthouse related pictures.",1017532800,2,2042,5.305555555555555
332234,1,6301540336,"International Film Forum presents a print of this film that couldn't have been much worse if they had pulled an abused 16mm print from the garbage.  Visuals: Blacks are washed out, midtones are coarse, visual noise and scars abound.  Sound: there is distortion on all significant sounds- this had been used so much that the sound is uniformly damaged. This is simply one of the most worn-out set of reels I've ever seen, in cinema or on video.  Even the picture on the box looks dreeadful and has a moire pattern.  Bottom line: Avoid- this version is no competition for the entirely servicable earlier release by other parties (though I forget who did it- not Film Forum).",1001980800,10,672,4.717948717948718
332235,3,6301540336,"I saw this movie for a class a while back and found it to be very slow, but informative because it reflected a part of life in Italy.  Though I must admit I've been to southern Italy and Accatone can still be seen in  present young Italians. Poverty,lazzines,pimping sounds horrific but in  this movie it sometimes becomes comical. This should be a must see movie if  your looking to compare or analyse changes in Italian society.",929059200,,430,4.618421052631579
7812237,4,6301540336,"""Accatone"" is an interesting movie for the fact that it focuses on groups of young Italian men, in the manner that was adopted decades later by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese in the United States.  There is an unapologetically hard exterior to this movie, in the macho swaggerings of the young men and the flagrant denigration of women.

In the title character, played by Franco Citti, the film presents a character who although he is largely unmotivated, vain and lost, still displays a latent softer side.  Though he manipulates a guileless girl named Stella into becoming a prostitute, she is so humiliated by the experience that Accatone becomes protective of her and tentatively tries to change his wayward life.

With saintly music provided by a Bach-filled soundtrack, and strong Mediterranean light bleaching the daylight scenes into a kind of purity, this film has religious undertones beneath the vulgarity of the impoverished characters.  Franco Citti has a complex face that reminds me simultaneously of Michael Sarrazin and Willem Dafoe in its combination of sensitivity and cruelty.

Made in the early 1960's, the toughness of this movie is in stark contrast to the rather flaccid entertainments that were the predominant product of Hollywood at the time.  Although it is not nearly so violent as the later films of Coppola and Scorcese, I believe that this film and others like it provided a blueprint for the dark, gritty realism that those directors banked on in films like ""The Godfather"", ""Raging Bull"",""Goodfellas"", and ""Mean Streets"" (...and Franco Citti in fact joined the cast of ""The Godfather"" as one of Michael Corleone's Italian bodyguards.)",1381881600,,1678,5.192592592592592

7812239,5,6301540336,"Although this film should have been restored before the transfer to DVD and the subtitles are hard to read as they blend into the white areas, this is still a masterpiece of a film you can not afford not to see if you like Pasolini. ""Accattone"" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini, but by a strange coincidence it ended up being the very last of all his movies that I saw. I had seen everything he ever did, including short films by the time I got to ""Accatone"" and still found it masterful.

Franco Citti stars as the title character, he is a handsome pimp in Rome's post-war lower depths, with an endearing face that speaks volumes of his street-wise upbringing in the slums. To those unaccustomed with Southern Italian culture the way he spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy may seem vile, but it is actually a well grounded tradition, as is also his support of the entire family of his imprisoned friend, Ciccio, who depend on him for survival. He is obviously a fellow mobster, and their code of honor is at stake when Accatone discovers that he is in prison as a result of his whore, Maddalena, played by Silvana Corsini, who denounced Ciccio to the authorities. Even though she is recovering from a broken leg, Accatone forces her to go on the streets, where she is used, beaten and abandoned by Accatone's pals after he tells them the story, then she is found by the police and arrested. Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income, he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his seduction act and her virile, beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense erotically-charged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men.

After meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella, (Franca Pasut) he is smitten and tries to get a job, so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long.

Never have I seen a more humane, direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all, and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.",1250726400,2,2729,4.59958932238193
7812240,5,6301540336,"Accattone is -at first glance- a simple portrait of a hopeless pimp, in the slums or Rome. His friends are part of band of pretty thieves who live according the random providence.

Accattone lives without working and Madeleine works in the streets to earn the daily bread and costs of living. But his life experiences a sudden twist of fate when he meets the innocence made woman, an alluring but shy woman Stella, who captures his full attention until he gets to convince her she makes exactly the same activity.

But the poetic treatment given by Pasolini marks the difference between what a simple existential chronicle of the Neo Realism Italian and a powerful and vibrating scream of agony and redemption. Watch for the final sequence in what Pasolini pays his personal homage to ""The thief of bicycles.""

The first Op. of this tragic director. A true masterpiece.",1242000000,,869,4.858108108108108
7812241,3,6301540336,"This is a fantastic film, but unfortunately this DVD package is not worthy of the work. The subtitles are the main point of criticism here - at times they are illegible (white captions on white backgrounds) and when they are legible the translation is often an embarassment (grammatical errors and typos throughout). If your Italian is strong, though, you shouldn't have too many complaints.",1235260800,4,391,5.125
7812242,3,6301540336,"This was the debut movie as director of Pier Paolo Pasolini and it is based on  novel he wrote .It is a study of life on the mean streets of Rome among the underclass of the city slums  .It uses non-professional actors drawn from the district in which the movie was shot .and seeks to unearth a raw poetry in the activities of the pimps ,prostitutes and petty thieves who populate the movie .It was a world he romanticised and sought sexual satisfatction from , being,asm he was , a homosexual with a penchant for rough trade .Indeed ,it is ironic that he was murdered by just the sort of working class youth that he (over)romanticised in this picture .

Accatone -played by Franco Citti-is a young man who is work shy and indolent ,a wastrel who is not tough enough or ruthless enough to make an impact as a criminal other than on the fringes of petty crime .He falls in love with Stella( Franca Pasut) and tries to make an honest living but is forced back into the more unremunerative type of criminal activity .

the movie is shot in a way that echoes the classic Italian neo-realist movies of the 1940's .It counterpoints the bustle and hand to mouth quality of life in the urban poor with the elegant classical sounds of Bach on the soundtrack -a device that for me simply does not work

The movie is worthwhile viwewing for devotees of European cinema but for me it does over romanticise its milieu and its inhabitants too much to be more than a near miss as a top grade semi-documenatray movie",1194998400,,1500,4.44
7812243,4,6301540336,"""Accattone"" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini.  Franco Citti stars as the title character, a small-time pimp in the slums of Rome.  He spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy.  However, when his girlfriend/prostitute (Maddalena) is arrested, Accattone nearly starves to death.  He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his act and has her brother beat up Accatonne.  He also tries to get a job, but he's clearly not willing to do menial tasks for little pay for very long.  Finally, he meets and woos the beautiful, naive Stella (Franca Pasut), and soon he professes his true love to her.  The tension builds as the audience guesses whether Accattone is simply trying to turn Stella into the next Maddalena.

Few films have more accurately captured the desperation of pimps and prostitutes, and Pasolini's use of mostly non-actors works spectacularly.  Accattone does some horrible things (the scene with his young son is unforgettable), but Citti's unsentimental performance strikes all the right chords and keeps the audience almost rooting for him in a strange and somewhat sick way.  Pasolini's work here is all first-rate.  The dvd includes one interesting extra - a 30-minute documentary from 1970 chronicling Pasolini's work, which includes interviews with some of the actors with whom he's worked as well as the Italian thinkers of the day.  Pasolini was an interesting character, to say the least; not many directors have brought such a unique political perspective to film.

Unfortunately, as has been noted by other reviewers, the dvd transfer is rather dismal.  The black-and-white movie is washed out here, with many of the daytime scenes overly saturated with light.  Furthermore, the subtitles are all in white and barely readable during a number of scenes.  Because of the horrendous subtitles, I had a great deal of difficulty following the movie at times.  This great film deserves a better transfer; ""Accattone"" deserves five-stars, but the four-star rating reflects the dvd quality.  Hopefully a new version will be released in the future.",1184371200,2,2192,5.1440677966101696
7812244,4,6301540336,"Now here is a slice of poverty and corruption, in the hands of a filmmaker who would go on to create a series of classics of the grotesque.  Accattone is utterly worthless, unattractive, and doomed, a destroyer who continually finds willing victims.  You cannot enjoy watching this, but you've got to admit it was original at the time.",1106438400,2,335,4.758620689655173
7812245,5,6301540336,This is all that's available folks so suffer through the defects and watch a timeless gem of a film. Pasolini's movie is one of the most honest portraits of slum life in Italy - and in fact is more brutally honest than 'nights of cabira' by Fellini (Pasolini actually was responsible for some of the dialogue in that film).,1096156800,10,323,4.491525423728813
7812246,3,6301540336,"The other reviews have covered the film sufficiently, so I'll just focus on this new DVD edition (although I will say that it seemed to be a bit of a re-hash of ""Nights of Cabiria"" without any of the pathos).
Actually, calling it ""new"" is a bit of a misnomer, as it appears to be a transfer from an old videotape.  This is strongly evident near the end of the film where there are two instances of scrolling video distortion.
I really wanted to like this disc.  The transfer itself is actually fairly clear (although slightly muted and/or washed-out) and mostly free of specks and dirt (except at the end of each reel).  Unfortunately, as with the previous three Waterbearer Pasolini DVD's, this one suffers from no chapter stops and burned-in (non-optional), frequently-unreadable subtitles.  At the price Waterbearer is charging, the consumer is going to expect a great deal more than they're getting.
Rent it if you're curious, but I'd advise against purchasing this disc unless you're a die-hard Pasolini fan.",1060041600,19,1013,4.906432748538012
