8387684,5,B0032W7CV8,"The DVD I bought is not entirely defect free. During the first of two gigs, I hear static on ""Love Games,"" ""The Sun Goes Down,"" and a few other songs, both through my T.V. and laptop. The second concert's audio quality is fine, though I would have preferred this to have been the other way around. I am considering having the disc replaced, but perhaps all of them are this way.

With that said, these two Level 42 performances are jaw dropping. I keep looking at Mark King and thinking what an animal he is on bass guitar. This is not a band just playing good music; it is an ensemble set out to destroy its competition and conquer the world. If you enjoy serious music, this is the band and concert for you.

Before I forget, the tracks are as follows:

1. Heathrow
2. Dance On Heavy Weather
3. Turn It On
4. Love Games
5. I Want Eyes
6. Sandstorm
7. Out Of Sight
8. Micro Kid
9. 43
10. Dune Tune
11. Starchild
12. The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up)
13. The Chinese Way
14. 88
15. Are You Hearing (What I Hear)
16. Almost There
17. Turn It On
18. The Chant Has Begun
19. Mr. Pink
20. I Want Eyes
21. Kansas City Milkman
22. The Prusuit Of accident
23. Kouyate
24. The Chinese Way
25. The Sun Goes Down
26. Hot Water
27. Love Games

God bless Level 42!

P.S. For those of you considering purchasing the few remaining copies of this disc, I have an update regarding the static noise I mention above. I recently had the DVD replaced. This time around, the audio problem is not there. However, the sound is slightly out of sync with the video. My guess is that the studio releasing this concert fixed the static noise while creating a different glitch. If I could go back, I probably would keep the first version I owned, as I felt like a member of the audience watching it. Oh well, c'est la vie...",1227657600,,1795,4.191304347826087
