I was never much into the Little Ponies, and the only ones I recognized were Firefly (played by Sandy Duncan), Medley (a killjoy with a generic British accent), and Applejack (whose voice is very different from the others'). However, you don't have to care about the Ponies to enjoy this film.

What I love about this film is the antihero, and the tension between him and the antagonist. The animators paid special attention to Scorpan's expressions and physical demeanor, subtly revealing the relationship between Scorpan and his dark master. The brightly-colored baby dragon, Spike, serves not only to lighten the somber visuals of Midnight Caste, but also to bring to light Scorpan's vulnerable side.

Considering that this half-hour special is supposed to be about the Little Ponies, it really underplays them: their personalities are never explored (though the first scene suggests some individuality), and their function in the story is less heroic and more ""damsels-in-distress"". Even Megan, the human heroine, has little characterization beyond her heroic initiatives. Most of the major plot gaps/assumptions come from the Ponies' side, since information is apparently passed off-screen or by osmosis or something. Then again, there's only half an hour in which to explain the entire plot, minus the beginning and ending theme song and three songs in-between (only one of which moves the story forward - the only song edited out when the special was aired in two parts, of course...).

I recommend this special for any little girl who seems inclined toward rainbow-colored ponies, and to nostalgic women like me who can appreciate the effort put into this little gem.",1282608000,4,1857,5.098684210526316
8255201,5,B0014D5WBY,"I remember watching this as a child, enthralled. I just bought this on VHS for my daughter and she loves it too. Warning, these are not the new My Little Ponies, these are the ones that had to compete with He-Man, She-Ra and the whole sword and sorcery genre that was so popular in the early 1980s. As such, this video is not quite as cute as the newer ones. There are dragons (both good and bad), an evil centaur and a creepy castle. It has a very dark atmosphere but Megan and a small band of ponies bravely fight against this centaur, Tirac, to keep darkness from enveloping the world. There is an epic feel, almost like Lord of the Rings and I almost wish Peter Jackson would do a remake of this! I only wish it was longer than 22 minutes. Well worth the money and time it took to track this down.",1260662400,2,801,4.174193548387096
