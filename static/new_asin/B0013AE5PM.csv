I watch it from beginning to end at least once a year. The cast and writing is the best that was ever done on tv, no other show will ever top this. I know Im not alone here, when I say that if this show was to, make a comeback it would be welcome. So if the powers that be read this..Please bring back The West Wing to TV and also on blu ray...",1362614400,2,525,3.7387387387387387
3102662,5,B0013AE5PM,A show like this has to be remastered to it's original glory. Please release an HD master of this Series!,1355616000,3,105,4.3
3102663,5,B0013AE5PM,YES PLEASE!!! The West Wing is magnificent and my present series set is beginning to wear out! Replacement is imminent and would like it to be Blu-ray PLEASE!,1347753600,3,158,4.678571428571429
3102664,5,B0013AE5PM,"Please if you do offer this on blu ray, create an agreement with the company producing this product that THEY will lose money if the discs are faulty.  I don't care whether it is a set or separate seasons.  The sets do seem to be of low quality here though.  But, please stop trying to sell junky product with missing DVDs, bad DVDs, etc.  Pay more attention to quality control.  When you sell a full set with all seasons, it seems like a trick because you only give people thirty days to review and return.

I have a set from Cheers and every disk is in perfect shape.  I watch them over and over.  I don't know why you can't get a good set together for a series like ""The West Wing.""",1323302400,3,685,4.136363636363637
3102665,5,B0013AE5PM,My only question is -- will the re-edit the first season to be widescreen?  It always bothered me that the first season was full screen.,1318377600,5,136,4.44

In fact, I'm learning that the quality usually suffers with this kind of packaging. Just put the seasons on blu ray already please!",1316390400,17,274,4.288461538461538
3102667,5,B0013AE5PM,"This series is fantastic.  Our family watch it every year atleast once. The DVD collection is starting to fail, and in some cases wasn't very good quality.

A Blu Ray release would be an instant purchase. Probably even two copies for safety.",1298937600,39,241,4.714285714285714

Not only for the quality, but for the fact I don't like buying 900 DVD box sets either.",1283904000,21,254,3.9038461538461537
3102669,5,B0013AE5PM,"I came late to the West Wing family. It is one of the most well written and acted series ever on television. Too many of my conservative peers refuse to watch because of its 'liberal' bent.  Yeah, but not really. It skewers both parties and their idiotic inability to work for the people.
Sorkin took great pains to educate us throughout the run of the show (even though he left after season 4), about partisanship, politics from the inside, the constitution and it's ammendments, and how the government is structured from each of the three branches.
Put your politics aside and you will truly enjoy The Bartletts and their staffs.",1274659200,25,631,4.736363636363636

8249577,5,B0013AE5PM,How in Gods name does this not at least have a Blu-ray release? Is it because the Standard def version is on Netflix? Well I have Netflix and its nearly unwatchable with the poor quality. I would gladly buy this series on bluray. Please make it so. Long overdue.,1525132800,,262,4.36734693877551
8249578,5,B0013AE5PM,There's a lot of disparity in quality between the sound and picture of various releases. Really want the blu-ray so we can have the best of both worlds.,1469577600,,152,4.464285714285714
8249579,5,B0013AE5PM,"Like so many others I love The West Wing and am at a loss why it has not been released on Blu-Ray. Even though shot with the standard definition aspect ratio the improved resolution in Blu-Ray would be a delight to my eyes and I gather many others too.

The series is one that even after many times watching still seems fresh to me. I remain impressed by the chemistry of the cast, the acting and the writing, Oh the writing and the engaging and well paced dialog.

I'll continue to wear out my DVDs until the Blu-Ray shows up some day. I hope.

8249580,5,B0013AE5PM,"The West Wing is already available with both English and French language tracks when purchased from Amazon.fr.  Unfortunately, region 2 DVDs won't play with our region 1 players.  It would be nice if the Blu Ray release of The West Wing was available with those language tracks in North America.  If so, I would purchase the entire Blu Ray collection in a heartbeat.",1403568000,,366,4.777777777777778
8249581,5,B0013AE5PM,"Love this series, have done ever since it aired on Australian TV more than a decade ago. Have been waiting, and hoping, for the Blu Ray version so I can update my DVD version. I only hope, that they'll remaster the seasons that were shot in 1.33:1 and provide them this time in 1.77:1.",1396656000,4,285,4.296296296296297
8249582,5,B0013AE5PM,"First and foremost, when at last this is available on Blu-ray, PLEASE don't package the disks so that they scratch.  Please treat The West Wing with the respect it deserves.

For me, the first three seasons are head and shoulders above the rest.  I'd prefer to get just those seasons.  But if it's available only as a complete series on Blu-ray, I'll buy the complete series.",1391040000,2,375,4.636363636363637

8249584,5,B0013AE5PM,"There is not much I can say about The West Wing that has not already been covered by reviews before me. It is, quite simply, the best TV series I have ever seen. (Vintage Star Trek comes very close in terms of an insightful and educated voice). I am not from the US -- I am Malaysian and I have friends here and around the world who have only seen patches because it's so hard to get DVDs that last. We are all thirsting for a Blu-ray version. I have watched the entire series 11 times and I'm nowhere near done. The appeals here only reflect the ones who have written in. There are undoubtedly hundreds -- if not  thousands -- more who will be on the alert if it ever gets formatted into Blu-ray. And isn't the very point of Blu-ray to preserve everything that's brilliant, striking and enduring about film and TV? The West Wing will be watched for decades to come.",1373500800,2,866,4.280487804878049
