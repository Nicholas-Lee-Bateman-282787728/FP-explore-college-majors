Im a sucker for a good alien abduction movie.  I love to see different takes on the whys and the hows when it comes to extraterrestrials and their fascination with poking and prodding us.  But, just like the horror genre, for every good movie you find, there are fifty horrible titles running right along side it.  Unfortunately, DAY 6 falls into the negative category here.  This film starts with an interesting premise, however the execution falls flat.  The result is a dull film that does not entertain or thrill.

DAY 6 is one of those films that tries real hard to make you like it, but theres just not much here to like.  I have to confess I actually fell asleep TWICE while watching this.  Both times I had to rewind, and both times the results were disappointing.

The film looks ok from a production standpoint, but again, theres not much to it.  The sets are primarily just apartments and/or office buildings, but nothing stands out.  The cinematography is plain, and the film quality appears to be a couple of ticks above a standard home video camera.

The acting in DAY 6 is mediocre, and theres no breakout performances from any of the cast.  Massimo Poggio plays the main character, Dr. Piso, and he does a decent job.  Laura Glavan, who portrays Saturnia/Hexabor of Ur, is very beautfiul, yet her performance is dry.  This is the case with pretty much the rest of the cast; although dramatic situations arise throughout the film, I never felt like any of the cast members were in the moment.

The story in DAY 6 is where I have the biggest problem.  It is a jumbled mess that never weaves together any cohesion.  Several things happen for no reason, and the audience is never clued in as to why.  Additionally, every attempt to build tension fails for some reason.  I cant quite figure out why, but theres never any buildup.  This is a huge reason the film does not work for me.

I cant recommend DAY 6, unless you are looking for a foreign alien abduction film that doesnt really contain any abductions.  The regression hypnosis the doctor uses never really results in anything mind-bending, and the interactions with Hexabor of Ur are uninteresting.  The movie tries and tries to conjure up some sort of suspense, but in the end it just fails.",1446076800,3,2334,4.606796116504855
