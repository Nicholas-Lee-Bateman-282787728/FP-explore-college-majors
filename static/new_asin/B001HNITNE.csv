8309153,3,B001HNITNE,I received the German version with an odd shaped case with the 16 rating printed on the front. Very disappointed.,1491177600,,113,4.7
8309154,5,B001HNITNE,"Since this is one of my favorite bands, it would have to be really bad for me not to like it, but it's not!",1433980800,,107,3.5
8309155,3,B001HNITNE,I have no complaints.,1406937600,,21,4.5
8309156,5,B001HNITNE,"Easily one of my most favorite live blu-rays every. I've watched this thing many times and its always good, especially during summer BBQ's, the whole thing just sounds awesome.",1366329600,,176,5.103448275862069
8309157,3,B001HNITNE,"This is a pretty good product. It is annoying that the music keeps getting interrupted for unnecessary commentary.  If it wasn't for this, this would get 5 stars.",1358726400,,162,4.785714285714286
8309158,5,B001HNITNE,"Love this dvd. I also own Red Rocks and this has more behind the scenes, etc. Red Rocks is straight concert dvd for the most part. Also, the quality of this blue ray is very nice.",1278892800,,179,4.0
8309159,3,B001HNITNE,"I have their Red Rocks DVD and like it WAY better then this one. The concert footage is a combination of multiple shows in different venues / outfits / guitars all for the same song. You never know which show you're hearing vs. which ones you're seeing.

In addition, the sound was just okay. I own multiple concert DVDs and the sound on this one just didn't do anything for me.

My biggest complaint though is the ""artsy"" concert footage, with random zooming in and out / in and out of focus. Honestly, this makes it unwatchable for me. Gives me a headache.

Great band, great performances, just didn't care for the way it was presented on the DVD.",1266278400,2,649,4.436974789915967
8309160,4,B001HNITNE,"When I first got the DVD I was certainly pleased with the product. I bought the Blu Ray on a pre-sale, when I finally got it I thought it would have some sort of bonus features like the Red Rocks Blu Ray did, being that the Blu Ray disc has more storage capacities than a DVD. I thought, you know, maybe they'll (by they I don't mean the actual band) include all of their music videos (what fan wouldn't like that). Maybe the whole footage of their KROQ appearance., but no just a different menu. The quality of the Blu Ray obviously is amazing to say the least, but you can tell the footage comes from the different cameras, as the scenes changes one notices the changes in quality of the different cameras. All in all I'm still happy i got, being that I'm long time Incubus fan.",1232496000,,780,4.277027027027027
8309161,3,B001HNITNE,"I bought this DVD when it first came out last year.  It's not as great as the now classic Incubus Attacks: Volume Two, but still a collectable for most Incubus fanatics.
Yesterday, the Blu Ray HD version was released.  I was wondering if the Blu Ray version has any differences from the DVD?!?  It comes out a year later on a disc that has 10 times the storage capacity so I would imagine that they would throw a few new things on there for the folks who already bought the DVD more than a year ago.
Maybe not then?",1228867200,,515,4.181818181818182
