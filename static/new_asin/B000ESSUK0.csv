8113987,3,B000ESSUK0,Poor English speaking and the training is VERY basic. Not worth it,1463356800,,66,4.583333333333333
8113988,5,B000ESSUK0,"I'm 43 years old, The last time I really practice Tae Kwon Do I started from five years old to 16 years old.  I made it to green belt - I was Fortunate enough that my Master teacher sensei would teach instruct me with black belts classes.  Once I made it to green belt my mother could no longer afford me to test for higher belt degree's.  My mother said the testing courses were to much for her to afford.  I've also dabble through - out my years with other fighting arts, and sports.  This DVD is very basic to the point.  Some of the instructions on this dvd from what I can see is based on Tae Kwon Do, while other parts of instruction look similar to Karate.  It looks, and seems like what is being instructed upon is very hybrid between both Tae Kwon Do, and Karate.  At my age I'm no longer into something purely from the point of learning a style. I look at can it work - could it save my life.  Yes I really beleive with what I've seen on this DVD, with miminmum time, and effort what is being taught on this dvd could possible save someone's life if they needed to rely upon some type of basic instrution when they had none to begin with.  Quality of DVD very good.",1313798400,4,1175,4.114035087719298

8113990,3,B000ESSUK0,"I have bought this DVD in hope to help me in my Taekwondo learning, but i becaume very dissapointing.

No names in Corean, it doesn't bellong to WTF - World Taekowndo Fedaration.

Amazon must update the information, not 10 dvd's but only 1.",1170806400,6,240,4.558139534883721
8113991,5,B000ESSUK0,I have limited opportunity to get to my dojang because of my work schedule. Because of this I rely heavily on books and tapes for home study and practice. Master Osamu's works have been enormously helpful in this respect at a very affordable price.,1164067200,7,248,4.659090909090909
