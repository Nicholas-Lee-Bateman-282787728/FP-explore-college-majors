8520390,5,B007PK9NHE,Classic Bigfoot film brought to you by Tom Biscardi who has been researching the legend of Bigfoot longer than anyone living. The production is a true look at the beginning of the Bigfoot era told by one of the legends  - Ivan Marx. This is the real thing - no Hollywood glitz or faked productions for a TV crew. If you have any interest at all in Bigfoot check this film out.,1427587200,,376,4.222222222222222
8520391,1,B007PK9NHE,"Absolute joke! Well known fraud Biscardi and Ivan Marx (NOT MARKS AMAZON IDIOTS!) tried to sell this as real footage of a Bigfoot back in 1977.

Run time is only 48 minutes and if you play the .vob file directly you'll see when Carmine pressed play on the VCR when creating the DVD master.",1396656000,,289,4.351851851851852
8520392,5,B007PK9NHE,Was a good movie for an older video. One of the first videos made of Bigfoot and is the second made by Ivan Marks. I think both are good,1396569600,,136,3.7241379310344827
