3503284,1,B001C00AHA,I couldn't watch this because the instant video sound was so out of sync that entire conversations are had before the sound kicks in.,1402099200,3,133,4.583333333333333
3503285,4,B001C00AHA,"This movie was low budget, but not too bad over-all!  It reminded me a bit in tone as a combination between Deliverance and Gator Bait.  This would not be a movie for anyone sensitive to violence or gore in films.  Although the level of gore was not the worst of the worst by any means.  I think the movie was worth the $ I spent for it.",1382832000,3,337,3.985074626865672

3503287,1,B001C00AHA,Four beautiful women decide to take a trip to Florida together. They also decide not to take their clothes off or engage in any remotely adult situations. This makes the movie a PG rated borefest...They do run afoul of some fat ugly rednecks whom they promptly dispatch before they all hug and head back to their day jobs.

3503289,3,B001C00AHA,"This is a fairly good action movie. Some of it is a bit weird, such as one of the girls carrying a crossbow for protection in the Everglades instead of a gun. I think the redneck characters are overdone.",1483401600,2,203,4.230769230769231

3503304,1,B001C00AHA,I Will start by saying the scenery of the Florida Everglades is amazing. The high definition shots are awesome and crispy clear. The performances of every actor's character in the film is awful. The writing and story is abysmal and uninteresting. I will never recommend this film to anyone.,1474502400,,290,4.938775510204081

Basically it is ""Deliverance"" set in a swamp, not on a river, without a good cast and apparently absent any discernable plot...just some babes in push-up bras...",1473638400,,482,4.682352941176471

3503351,1,B001C00AHA,"What? You mean every group of friends don't plaster on the makeup and short shorts, stock up on a tasty vintage red wine, and vacation in the Florida Everglades? I mean, isn't that on every person's bucket list?

This movie was a horrendously insulting joke even before it began. To think someone actually pitched this movie to an investor (asking for the $48 it took to make it) and thought it was a viable story for a movie...is troubling to say the least.

Something like this?

Investor - ""Hmm, well that sounds really good but I don't think the dangers of the Everglades is enough to really capture the viewer's attention. Deadly gators, snakes, panthers and various other wild animals aren't threatening enough.

Writer/Producer/Director - ""Well I guess we could just copy Deliverance and have some toothless, inbred rednecks who terrorize the former sorority girls with horrendous southern accents?""

Investor - ""OK, but you have to name one of them Bubba.""

Writer/Director/Producer - ""Well, of course, that's a given.""

Investor - ""Well missy, you have yourself a deal. Make that movie!""

Writer/Director/Producer <to herself> - Great. Now where am I going to find a cast of awful actors, and a sound person and editor with no technical expertise at all? Oooo, I know. My friends!""",1470441600,10,1290,4.967441860465116
3503352,1,B001C00AHA,"Horrible, the only good thing about the movie was NOTHING. better acting in a 5th grade play. It was like watching a movie produced, directed, and acted by a bunch of touched people. The girls in the cast should stick to cinemax movies.",1470096000,2,236,4.511627906976744
