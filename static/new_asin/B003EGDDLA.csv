4114026,4,B003EGDDLA,"I guess I'm the weirdo here because most people seem to think that The Chase is the gem here and The Space Museum can be easily tossed aside.
For me it's the opposite, I love The Space Museum and that's why I bought this video. For me it's not just classic Who it's classic science-fiction through and through... The Chase is a nice little romp, and I have seen it in its entirety and it IS a shame of the Beatles being cut out because I like pop culture references in fantasy and science-fiction. Buffy anyone?
For me The Chase goes on too long and I found the Frankenstein/Dracula scene kind of ridiculous actually, I like my sci-fi and fantasy rooted in reality that's why I like the culture references so to have the good Doctor meet fictional characters to me is absurd because The Doctor IS rooted in reality. He meets all sorts of historical figures like Nero in The Romans or Elizabeth I in The Day of the Doctor. The only time when meeting fictional characters makes sense for him is in The Mind Robber when a fictional world is created out of mental energy....
So The Space Museum does it for me, The only thing I like about The Chase at all to be honest if Episode One with the Beatles and the last Episode and how they handled the departure of Barbara and Ian. And that's the ONLY reason why I care anything about The Chase at all.
The Space Museum on the other hand I love because it reminds me so much of those Lost In Space episodes I grew up with as a kid. I wasn't around for the first transmissions of Doctor Who or Lost In Space but they both share that great thing about not knowing where you will end up next.
Very few sci-fi shows really have that, most are supposed to make you feel all warm and comfy with the characters and the settings. Sure Star Trek had adventure and moral dilemmas, of course it did and it is one of the literal flagships of science fiction and always will be but please never underestimate The Doctor and don't underestimate The Space Museum.
As much as I love Star Trek, the original show and the later series like The Next Generation what those shows brought home was in fact 'a home'. Those are comforting science fiction and fantasy shows. Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Buffy, Angel, Game of Thornes, Firefly, Space 1999, Sliders, Farscape, the Twilight Zone, even the X-Files (you notice I didn't mention Stargate or Babylon 5, can't stand 'em. Blah...)
They're all designed to make you feel comfortable, part of the family of characters. They all have a home and spend an awful LOT of time telling stories on their ships or in their home town to make you feel that way even when they kill off long time characters... much like Hogwarts in space.
But what's so completely compelling about Doctor Who and as silly as it sometimes was Lost In Space both have that reckless 'anything can happen' sense about that that very few other shows had.
Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Picard, Date, and Commander Archer could all go back to their respective The Enterprise even if the Earth itself exploded oh well... another thrilling day at the office! Same for all the rest.
But with The Doctor especially even with the cardboard backdrops still the good acting and the good storytelling and the fact that the crew were eager to get away from the TARDIS and keen to start a new adventure places DW unique among even the best of science fiction.
The Space Museum is a really nice, tight story, perfect from beginning to end really. Very straight forward and thrilling with the whole, ""I wonder how they're going to get out of it this time"" feeling with lots to do for each character and even some friction between them going on which to me adds again to that touch of reality.
As much as I love The War Games there are some spots that are too repetitive and overdone though it is a masterpiece and far outdoes both The Key To Time and Trial Of A Time Lord in it's story, complexity, humor, acting and characters.
And for me anyway The Space Museum is one of the better full surviving stories of the original first Doctor and wonderfully exemplifies that ANYTHING can happen whilst traveling in time and space....
Please get this DVD before like some of the others from the first two Doctors it goes out of print and the price becomes astronomical.
My personal favorite surviving episodes from the Hartnell era in order of transmission are:

The Daleks (story 2)
Planet of Giants (story 9)
Dalek Invasion of Earth (story 10)
The Romans (story 12)
The Space Museum (story 15)
and The War Machines (story 27)

To me those are the BEST of the 1st Doctor stories, I really can't stand Dodo and The Ark just doesn't do anything for me. Same with The Gunfighters, The Chase, The Rescue, The Sensorites or The Aztecs although The Aztecs are more forgivable and so are The Sensorites. I just feel that the ones I mentioned earlier are the best Hartnell stories that have survived complete.
And I'll tell you what The Time Meddler certainly isn't work the $100.00 or more dollars they want for it here or on Barnes & Noble.
I do wish that The Tenth Planet was complete but to be honest for the money I'm not interested in owning a DVD with incomplete or reconstructed stories when perhaps someday they might be found.
I do own the Lost In Time DVD's for both Hartnell and Troughten just to have sort of a glimpse of what was but when I watched The Tenth Planet I was so heartbroken when I saw it wasn't complete that I can't stand to own any full stories (or pay that kind of money) when there are so many other Doctor Who Classics I still need to pick up.
I love An Unearthly Child more for sentimentality and because after all it is the first and introduces the entire series as well as is a great intro. The full caveman part I don't like very much but the beginning with Susan in school and Barbara and Ian wondering what she's all about is great mystery and build-up to The Doctor and the TARDIS and it's why Susan will always be one of my fav companions.
Anywho, that's my two cents but I highly recommend The Space Museum as one of the very best stories in the 50 odd years of Doctor Who's long running show and one of the very best stories in science fiction in general.",1390176000,,6201,4.43859649122807
4114027,1,B003EGDDLA,"I have been a Doctor Who fan since childhood and have undoubtedly spent thousands of dollars on merchandise over the course of my life. Just the DVDs and novels purchased here on Amazon fill an entire bookcase in my living room. Imagine my excitement to see these two stories, as mediocre as they might actually be, released on DVD. Would I finally have a replacement for those old rotting VHS tapes my dad recorded from PBS broadcasts in the 80s? Sadly, no.

They actually cut footage from this release! If you are a new fan of Doctor Who or don't know the history: huge amounts of the early classics were destroyed by BBC management back in the day. It turned many of these missing stories into legends, even if in reality they were some of the most mediocre examples of the series. Fans lobbied tirelessly to drive efforts to find, restore, and in some cases recreate lost footage. So to hear that they actually cut a scene from this release should stab at the heart of every fan! It runs counter to everything that has kept this series alive, through the darkest of times, and continues to make it astronomically profitable for them today.

So I will not be purchasing this release. Instead, I will be dusting off those old rotting VHS tapes and trying to connect a VHS player to my fancy flat-screen TV. My wife and daughter will be watching it as it aired on PBS three decades ago, complete with footage of our beloved characters listening to the Beatles. I would also like it publicly known that I had two other new Doctor Who DVDs in my cart and dropped them over this. I will be taking some time off from purchasing new Doctor Who merchandise. I can only hope that executives at the BBC read these customer reviews and stop treating the people who line their pockets with gold and the series they love like trash.",1387324800,,1822,4.5181818181818185
4114028,5,B003EGDDLA,My son loves anything Dr. Who so it was an easy purchase.as I thought he loved this DVD to add to his collection..,1382832000,,114,4.0
4114029,4,B003EGDDLA,"I just finished watching the shows (with and without the commentary); I am working my way through the other special features.

I was especially influenced to get ""The Chase"" because Ian and Barbara leave, so it is a minor pivotal show (major pivotal = The Doctor regenerates; minor pivotal = change of companions)

""The Space Museum"" - I've read the novelization, and it is better than the show.  I didn't think the show was all that bad; I was pretty taking aback at all of the nasty things that the people in it had to say about it. Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) is particularly nasty and harsh about the show; if this was her first commentary, I'm rather surprised she was asked to do any more. She stated repeatedly that she remembers almost nothing of her Doctor Who days (and she apparently doesn't care).  Apparently the director / direction was terrible, and he was never asked back. Anyway, there is at least one huge flaw; at some point, the ""bad guys"" (Morlocks?) are sending in paralyzing gas to drive out their enemies; Barbara and a Xeron are trapped and pass out... but then later revive and stagger out, with no explanation.  After listening to the commentary and as pointed out in the reviews, the philosophical part to this show is fascinating... you see your own future; can you avoid it? Is something as small as losing a button going to change the future?  Great idea.  The novelization (by the man who wrote the script) is actually a pretty good read.

""The Chase"" - I think I've read this as well, because I've never seen the show before, but I remember reading the Beatles scene; I didn't realize it was missing when I watched the show (I remembered that they were supposed to be in it, and looked for it). I eventually realized that they had been cut. Frankly, it really didn't detract from the show at all - I would have preferred to see the show as it really was, and I think it's rather dumb to leave the scene out. And that's enough said about that).  Barbara and Ian have an excellent send-off; I wish it had been longer; I would love to see what they were going to do after being away from their jobs for two years. Being an American, I have no idea what the issue with ""threes"" on the bus means... from the context, maybe he was asking for two third-class tickets, and the bus lines had abolished third class between 1963 and 1965 - but that's just a guess.  Vicki (Maureen O'Brien) was much better on this commentary; she confesses that she didn't consider the TV job ""real"" acting, and did not take advantage of her time.  The director was incredibly harsh on himself, I thought.",1330041600,4,2607,4.51380042462845
4114030,5,B003EGDDLA,"And that 5 star rating goes for both stories. I'm not sure why The Space Museum gets a bad reputation, even the so-called ""defense"" extra on the DVD from someone who ""loves"" the story seems to only love the 1st episode.

I find the whole story surreal and claustrophobic at the same time. Having not heard anything story-wise before watching, the first episode is a fantastic one, questions mounting up smoothly, before the TARDIS crew sees their future selves as exhibits.

Honestly, I found it enough to carry you through the story. It turns into a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse, Ian, Barbara and Vickie trying desparately to avoid their fate, the Doctor getting lost, and providing some of his best comedy lines. I love the scene with the Dalek exhibit, where he hides in the Dalek and imitates them ""I fooled them all! I am the Master!""

The comedy takes over completely in The Chase, and that's the only way you can look at it. No words can really do justice, because you're honestly not sure if they intended it to be a high-drama blockbuster, or just said ""Forget it, we'll make it as silly as possible."" And somehow it works. The tour guide at The Empire State Building, who sounds like he's on his first day on the job and has been out clubbing the night before. ""And here we are at the, uh... top floor, which is, uh, really really big, and if you, uh, step this way, uh, um..."" (Slight exaggeration but not much.)

Two very different stories, yet for me they just show how many directions Doctor Who can go. Limitless in other words.",1328745600,,1548,4.557553956834532
4114031,4,B003EGDDLA,"In the Willam Hartnell era Doctor Who epesidoe entitled ""The Space Museum"" The Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki have landed on the planet Xeros.  While traveling to it they discover strange things going on. There colthes changed from what they were wearing. Water the Doctor asks for from Vicki falls up from the ground instead of down.  On landing they leave no tracks in the sand and no one on the planet seems to be able to see them. For on Xeros the planet and its inhabitants serve the Molok Empire that has converted it into a vast space museum to the Molok Empire.  What the Doctor and the others discover is that they themselves have become part of the museum and time begins to catch up with them.  Soon the Doctor and the others are slit up.  Ian and Barbara dealing with the Molok's in charge and Vicki aiding the Xerons in a rebellion.  The Doctor being captured and placed within the musuem and unable to help the others.  Can the Doctor and the rest find out what is really going on and stem off there fate as being part of the museum?
  IN the next series of episodes entitled ""The Chase"" the Daleks have created a time ship that will follow the TARDIS wherever it goes.  The force selcted has one task to seek, locate and destroy the Doctor and his companions and ensure future victory for the Daleks. MEanwhile the Doctor and the others are looking at the visualizer a device taken from the space museum on the planet Xeros and begin to look through the various points in human history.  The visualizer also shows them the Dalek plan to chase them through time and space.  The Doctor begins to take the TARDIS to various places throughout space and time.  A barren world where the last inhabitants try to surivie, on board a ship on the high seas on earth, the top of the Empire state building in New York in the 1960's, even the Doctor's own mind as a place to stave off the chase.  The Doctor having enough decides to land on  another world and make that the battle ground.  The Daleks give chase and use tactics to ensure that they win with a clone of the Doctor.  The Doctor fighting his own clone force them deeper into the strange world and encounter a race called the Mechanoids.  A race of thinking robots with a grand city unlike anything the group has seen.  They also encounter a human by the name of Steven who informs them he crashed on his way to a colony nearby in the star system.  Only to discover that the Doctor and the others have been placed within a zoo like Steven was.  Now trapped and the Daleks hot on there trail will they get out?  What will happen to the Docotr and the others?  Will they be on display for the Mechanoids forever or will the Daleks destroy them to achive victory?",1327881600,,2724,4.382470119521912
4114032,4,B003EGDDLA,"The Space Museum is a wonderful story focused on time.  Doctor and his people arrive before they arrive.  Well, the use of time as a major part of the plot does make it an interesting Doctor Who story.  Sad to say the rest of the story - themes, settings, and characters drag the story down.  On the other hand, we get to see a Dalek as a museum display.  Weird.
Will the Doctor and his companions escape before they also become displays?
The Chase is one of those epic stories.  The Doctor and his companions are chased by the Daleks, which is the meaning of the title.  It seems that the Daleks have decided to take out the Timelord once and for all.  Also, they have invented a Time Machine which is, in fact,  easier to handle than the Doctor's own time machine.  They visit many places in time and space including New York City!
Both stories have commentaries and extras which is worth watching or listening to.  If you liked this set I would suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Rescue-The-Romans-Stories-11-12/dp/B001U3ZYXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Rescue / The Romans (Stories 11 & 12)</a>.",1325548800,,1177,5.174603174603175
4114033,4,B003EGDDLA,"I really like The Space Museum. It was about how they needed to change the future, but weren't sure what would do that. Even the Doctor was clueless--and he's always saying to make sure you don't change anything. Yet in the Romans, if he hadn't done certain things, historical events would not have come to pass. In this one, he shows that no one really knows what will affect the future. Plus it was a quick story filled with actual action. The Space Museum was episodes 26-29 of season 2.

As for The Chase, it was okay, but we see how young and unknowledgeable this
doctor is compared to the current series. And then there is this one comment that bugs me where they have this thing that can show you images from the past, and a particular one comes up, and he's all ""Well, it had to happen in the past for it to be on here."" Hel-lo! You're in a time machine! Past, present, and future are all relative. And it may be in the past of where you are now 6000 years in the future, but that doesn't mean it's sudden;y going to start affecting you in two seconds. But I really did love the Frankenstein House episode. The Chase is made up of episodes 30-35 of season 2.",1311984000,,1166,4.252252252252252
4114034,4,B003EGDDLA,"I really enjoyed these DVDs.  You might really enjoy them too, if you are willing to see the comedy in what is many ways a parody of other Doctor who episodes, and if you are willing to care about the characters.  Otherwise, it does not work, and there are hard core Doctor Who fans who just did like these stories.

First, these stories are comic in intent.  In 1965, the Doctor Who people thought Daleks are funny, time travel can be funny, and the Doctor himself can sometimes be a bumbling fool.  The Doctor Who series involves a time traveling alien whose space craft resembles a police call box, at least from the out side.  This alien is just called the doctor.  In the the first two seasons of the show, the Doctor and his friends had traveled to various periods in earth's past, the Aztec empire, Tibet at the time of Marco Polo, and so on.  The doctor had also traveled to distant planets where he encountered other aliens.  In particular, he had encountered Daleks, a race of aliens who had adapted to living inside of metal robot like bodies--if you do not know Daleks imagine R2D2 with a plunger for a hand, an eye that sits at the end of a stalk--a bug like eye-and a deadly ray gun built into the Dalek's body.  The doctor had apparently wiped out the Daleks in an early episode, but another episode the doctor visits earth in the 22nd century and learns that Daleks have invaded and conquered earth.  The Doctore saves the earth, of course.  The concept of time travel, however, had been developed very little.  The show had never dealt with the time travel paradox, and the show had never introduced the possibility that there might be other aliens, aside from the Doctor, who had time travel.  The first story in this collection deals with the paradox.  The Doctor and friends, have an encounter with a future where they see themselves as exhibits in a museum, and try to change that future.  The episode has a lot of stumbling, and ill conceived ideas about how to change the future.  The episode, has Daleks on display in a museum, and the people running the museum are part of an evil empire that is going down hill, and the museum intended as a monument to this empire is largely ignored. It is clearly a joke.  The next story involves the Daleks creating a time machine to chase down the doctor because they are angry about what he did to them in two previous stories.  The idea of a chase through time and space is clearly a joke, and to underscore this the sound track is a lively rag time piano piece.  Both stories are parodies of B-movies and of previous Doctor Who episodes.  Since this was made in 1965, the special effects are B-movie quality.

Obviously, it would be hard to pay attention to 10 episodes of jokes about B-movies if you don't care about the characters.  But, I am going to make the case that characters are strong point of the first two seasons of Doctor Who.  For those who do not know--Doctor Who is a program that is still on the air.  The Doctor has been played by eleven different actors, on TV.  The thirty second season of Doctor Who is about to be aired.  The Doctor has always kept friend with him on his various journeys, and most of these friends have been human.  The Doctor is known for saving the earth from all sorts of alien plots, many of these by Daleks. The interesting thing about the first two season's of Doctor who is that he was evolving into the character who would be loved for decades to come.  When we first met the Doctor--see the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Beginning-An-Unearthy-Child-The-Daleks-The-Edge-of-Destruction/dp/B000CNESV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Beginning (An Unearthy Child / The Daleks / The Edge of Destruction)</a>.  He did not like humans, he did not trust humans, and he cared about other people very little.  He had deliberately abducted two other characters--Ian and Barbra--because they had learned about his time machine, and the Doctor did not trust them with that kind of information. He could not just take them back to their time, because where his space-time machine landed was more or less random.  In the stories in the Beginning collection, the Doctor, Ian and Barbra learn that they can trust each other, often need each other. Over the course of the first season, all three of them become willing to risk their lives to save the other two.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Dalek-Invasion-of-Earth-Story-10/dp/B0000ADXG3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Dalek Invasion of Earth (Story 10)</a>, is the first time the Doctor, fights to save the earth, rather than just save his friends.  In a certain twist, at the end of the Chase, when Ian and Barbra find a way to get to their own time, the Doctor is as concerned about being left without them as anything, and tries to talk them out of leaving.  Another character, Viki, defends, Ian and Barbra's decision, but this is after a time when she feels that with all the people in the space-time ship, she is a ""fifth wheel.""  The characters involved in the story are complex, and it would be hard to sit through these stories without caring about them as individuals.

Interestingly, this is the penultimate, show of the second season, and in the final episode, The Time Meddler, the Doctor has finally become the hero who we know and love.  In that story, he heroically fights another time traveler--from the Doctor's own planet--who is plotting to change earth's history.  It took two years to get to the Doctor as we know him, and that is what makes the episodes from the first two seasons interesting.  You learn about the various people who changed the Doctors life, and the Space Museum and the Chase is a essentially the end of the story.  It might help to have seen the stories in the Beginning collection before you watch these stories.  The special effects are terrible, but you may not notice if you are laughing at the whole show,  and the extras are not as fantastic as some extras in other other Doctor Who collections.  The high points are the commentary on Ian and Barbra, and the account of Dalek toys and comic books in the 1960s.

I had great fun with this video: it is wonderful laughs.",1303257600,2,6315,4.806481481481481
4114035,5,B003EGDDLA,"This is hands down the best William Hartnell Doctor Who DVD release. I've purchased just about every classic Doctor Who release available and while I find the first doctor years weaker than Troughton, Pertwee, and Baker... These stories are still excellent Doctor who stories that are very important to hardcore fans.

Disc 1: The Space Museum (4 episodes) is very enjoyable story despite some fans dislike of these episodes. Great chemistry in the cast, and a welcome guest star if you're a sci-fi fan in Jeremy Bulloch(known for playing Boba Fett). Special features are very good including an interview with Bill Hartnell's granddaughter.

Disc 2: The Chase (6 episodes) is probably the best early Dalek story after ""Dalek Invasion of Earth"". The way the story moves from one location to the next so quickly makes the story drag much less than other 6 parters.

Disc 3: the special features are fantastic. With a career retrospective on the daleks, and William Russell talking about Ian and barbara's final adventure, this set is essential to doctor who fans.

Side Note: I've never seen the beatles clip, so no I don't know what I'm missing. But I enjoy the beatles because I like the beatles, and i enjoy Doctor Who because I like doctor who. One doesn't make or break the other for me. It'd be a shame if doctor who fans don't buy this because of negative reviews that in no way correlate with the actual stories.",1298419200,7,1418,4.775510204081633
4114036,2,B003EGDDLA,"If you're a diehard fan of classic Doctor Who who simply must have every episode of the First Doctor available on DVD, then you're stuck: You have no choice but to pony up for this overpriced dual offering of two of the dullest stories from the William Hartnell years. If you just want a taste of what early Doctor Who was about, go with ""The Aztecs"" or ""The Web Planet.""

In the ""The Space Museum,"" the Doctor and his companions discover they have been turned into a museum exhibit on a planet on the fringes of a moribund galactic empire and must change history to escape their fate. The four-episode story was so bad that the Special Features menu includes ""Defending the Museum,"" a re-evaluation of the sequence by Who critic Robert Shearman explaining why the story wasn't THAT bad, but still pretty bad. There's also a bizarre spoof feature in which comedian Christopher Green, in his Ida Barr persona, explains how the show cleverly covered for actors while they were on vacation, briefly writing them out of scripts or taping bits that could be edited in later. It's an interesting, behind-the-scenes look at one aspect of producing a weekly TV serial, but the point of the Ida Barr shtick will be lost on most American viewers.

""The Chase"" is a tired, late Terry Nation story in which the Daleks chase the Doctor and his companions through time as they land in various times and places, mostly in Earth history. Peter Purves makes a dual appearance, first as an American Southerner sightseeing at the top of the Empire State Building and later as Steven Taylor, a captive of the planet Mechanus who will become one of the Doctor's companions in ""The Time Meddler."" ""The Chase"" is episodic and entirely unremarkable, except as the story in which Ian and Barbara return to 1965 London.

The Special Features included on the third disc redeem the substandard program content somewhat, but do not justify the high list price. Not to be missed are a brief documentary on Shawcraft, the private modeling company commissioned by the BBC to build the first Daleks, and ""Follow That Dalek,"" an amateur color film showing how Shawcraft made many of the early props for Doctor Who as well as the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car.

Finally, a word about ""helpful votes"": Please do not rate this review as ""unhelpful"" simply because I don't give every Doctor Who story five stars. I love Doctor Who and regard it as the greatest science fiction TV series of all time, but I believe the point of reviews is to elevate the great above the merely good and the good above the plainly bad. If you disagree with me, write your own review and rate mine ""helpful"" for inspiring you to contribute something you might not otherwise have done. Save ""unhelpful"" for reviewers who can't spell or write a complete sentence. Thanks.",1292803200,22,2809,4.726530612244898
4114037,1,B003EGDDLA,"First off let me say that it's my understanding that if the fans had not brought up the subject so vocally beforehand, the Beatles scene might have just slipped in under the radar. I'm not going to blame anyone on the BBC side, least of all the Restoration Team who work so hard on these releases.

Now let me tell you ... it irks me to no end that the scene has been cut from the American release. Is it crucial to understanding the overall storyline? Well it's definitely important to that episode but overall I suppose not ... though many other scenes fit that description even more so. Regardless, they BELONG there. And we can talk all day about protecting artistic rights but cutting this scene, with its historical significance within the program as well as in real life, does nothing for the surviving artists themselves -- who as we know wanted to appear on the show. Not allowing the scene is simply a crime against culture.

My personal solution? Though I don't support its being released with the scene cut and I in no way believe that refusing to buy this one story will endanger future releases, I've decided that I will buy it ... and I will also illegally download the entire Beatles catalog*. Further, I will keep only The Space Museum and give away The Chase, making sure the recipient knows all about the missing scene and how to find it if so desired. Finally, this is my cue to buy a region free dvd player ... which I'll need to watch the intact version I'll be buying from the UK. When I watch The Chase it will NOT be an edited version.

*OK I won't really be illegally downloading the Beatles ... but I won't be buying them either ;-)",1292284800,14,1659,4.432786885245902
4114038,2,B003EGDDLA,"Once upon a time nearly 10 years ago when Doctor Who: the original series went to DVD I began my decade long journey of collection every story of the original series and and in deed I have every one all of them are U.S.A. R1 editions, my set was nearing 100% completion with only 29 stories left to make it to DVD but then the unthinkable happen, the studio decided to edit a complete scene out of a classic Dr. Who story (the whole Beatles scene) so since the U.S.A. edition is cut to pieces I had to buy the British version to get the complete episode and because of this, my collection of Dr. Who stories will be forever at 99% complete.",1289347200,6,640,4.211382113821138
4114039,4,B003EGDDLA,"This release includes 2 unrelated stories from the William Hartnell era. The only thing that links them is that The Chase followed The Space Museum in sequential order. The first story, The Space Museum, has a nice, eerie and atmospheric beginning. However, the rest of the story, once our heroes have officially ""arrived"" doesn't make much sense. Yes, the Doctor's interrogation scene is a lot of fun, and it's a bit amusing to see Vicki as a rebellion leader, but Ian and Barbara are a bit wasted. So much of this story is sub-par, set design, costume design, story development, that it's not really not worth watching more than once.

The Chase brings the beloved Daleks back. The Daleks have somehow gotten their hands on a time machine and have decided that they must follow the Doctor through space and time to destroy him. Every week was a new location, like Terry Nation's previous story, The Keys of Marinus, making sure that the designers had to design new sets and alien costumes for each week. It's an odd assembly, that seems more like, hey what if the Daleks met Frankenstein's monster, yeah how about Dracula too! You know what, we can blame the Marie Celeste mystery on the Daleks, etc., etc. It's not a bad story, it's just not that interesting. The beginning with the time T.V. apparatus is fun, but is quickly left behind. It almost would have been more interesting to have the Doctor, Ian and Barbara watching various instances in history that are now wrong because a Dalek has shown up, and the Doctor realizes that he has to go correct this.

Everyone is so upset that somewhere between 10 seconds and 2 minutes have been cut from the Chase, but no one has really mentioned the true crime here... Why did I have to get the Space Museum just to watch the Chase?! I've seen The Space Museum, and even had it on VHS. It is a lukewarm story at best, but I really had no desire to upgrade it to the DVD format. Yes, the fist episode is quite unique and fascinating, why are there no footprints, why can't anyone see them, why are their clothes changed, but the next three episodes really don't live up to that fascinating beginning. Even the extras on the Space Museum all seem to focus on, well yes it's bad, but it's not THAT bad.

Now to the Chase. Yes, I would have loved to have seen the Beatles on Doctor Who. Yes, I've heard about that clip for years, and I was disappointed that it wasn't allowed to be on the DVD because of the whole Beatles rights in North America. But, the edit didn't affect the story. In fact, the story itself is actually just o.k. There are a few fun bits, especially the end where Ian and Barbara mug their way through London, delighted to be home. There are some nice extras on the Chase, mostly having to do with Dalekmania, but they are still fun.

So, this isn't an amazing DVD set. It's 2 fair to middling stories from the WIlliam Hartnell era. However, if you are a Dalek fan, you should definitely get this for the extras on the Chase.",1289088000,8,2992,4.4743589743589745
4114040,3,B003EGDDLA,"I'm not much of a Beatles fan, but I did like the scene in ""The Chase"" that they cut out on this DVD release. It's not only important to emphasize the Beatles impact on popular culture at the time this episode was made, but it also has some great and funny character moments in that scene between the Doctor's companions. And the scene is NOT a few seconds long as some people put it, it's at least a couple of minutes! I loved that scene, and you don't get it here on this DVD. That said, both ""The Space Museum"" and ""The Chase"" were great stories that any Whovian would enjoy!",1284163200,26,578,4.216216216216216
4114041,4,B003EGDDLA,"Here we have the fifteenth and sixteenth stories of ""Doctor Who"". Yes, from way back in the mid-1960's we get these little gems which aren't great, but are certainly entertaining. Plus the mere fact that they're 1960's ""Doctor Who"" THAT WE STILL HAVE makes them important.

""The Space Museum"" is a four-part story where the TARDIS crew begins to experience some odd wibbly-womey, timey-wimey stuff. They have different clothes for no obvious reason, Vicki breaks a glass which then mends itself and they appear to not be leaving footsteps when they walk on sand. Things get even more bizarre when they wander into a museum where no one seems to notice them and where they see themselves on display.

I rather liked this story, though it's true the last three parts don't hold up to the standard set by the first. It's something of a pity, but despite that I found the story to be rather entertaining, and was surprised to learn that it has something of a ""meh"" reputation among fans. Besides, you have to love the look on Hartnell's face when he emerges from an improvised hiding place. Oh, and a bit of fun: ""Star Wars"" fans should keep an eye open for a young Jeremy Bulloch, who later went on to play Boba Fett.

""The Chase"" is a six-parter showing the Daleks and the TARDIS crew locked in... well, a chase. Across space and time. The Doctor and company run somewhere. The Daleks follow. Wash, rinse, repeat for six parts.

Again, this isn't a bad story idea, though the execution isn't great. Still, there are some entertaining moments, like watching a Dalek fumbling math, seeing a Dalek go overboard on a ship and watching Daleks being menaced by Dracula (?) and Frankenstein's monster (?!). I also liked the bit where the TARDIS ends up in New York. Sadly there really isn't much of a story, per se, but the little scenes come together nicely and make for an overall entertaining tale.

There's lots of special features on these discs, as always, and the audio/video are quite good. I wouldn't be surprised if they're actually better than what they were when they were broadcast.

Now onto the Beatles thing. I'm not kidding in my headline here. If you didn't know it wasn't there, you wouldn't miss it. What's removed is a roughly 90 second clip showing the TARDIS crew seeing the Beatles performing ""Ticket to Ride"". It's a cute scene and I'm always amused by watching Ian's little dance. But it adds nothing to the plot and if you really feel the need to see it, a few moments of work on YouTube will get it to you. It's a pity that the clip had to be removed, but don't blame the BBC or 2|Entertain; blame the Beatles' people, who apparently didn't want to sell the rights to the clip. Refusing to buy this product because of a minor, non-story impacting clip is just silly and will keep you from seeing a delightful couple of stories.",1280620800,8,2846,4.59251968503937
4114042,5,B003EGDDLA,"I had to watch this twice to figure out where this horrible edit everyone keeps going on about was.  And even then I'm not 100% sure.  In the early Hartnell years the editing and the camera work was so jumpy to begin with it could have been in a couple of places.  Needless to say, didn't miss it at all. Is ignorance bliss? Am I only saying that because I don't know what the original sequence looked like?  Maybe. Would I have liked to have seen the Beatles clip?  Sure, who doesn't love the Beatles?  But I don't buy Doctor Who DVDs for Beatles clips.  I buy them for the Doctor, for the Tardis, for the wobbly sets, for the men in cheap monster suits, for the great on screen production notes.  But most of all I buy them for the fun.  And The Chase is a fun story with or without a film clip of the Beatles.",1278892800,4,812,4.0886075949367084
4114043,1,B003EGDDLA,"I would normally not mind that they removed the Beatles clip from ""The Chase"", but there are several reasons that this is relevant.

1. The broadcast. Even in the US, repeat broadcasts contained the clip.
2. The VHS tape. The rights were secured then-- why doesn't whatever agreement was used then, still apply now to the DVD?
3. The product announcement during Pre-Order-Mania did not mention the edit, nor that they were not sure they would be able to include the clip.
4. The Beatles WANTED to be on the show! It was only because they were filming ""Help!"" that they couldn't make it and a special clip of them was used instead of the original idea, which would have been about the 50th anniversary of their first appearance on television, and them dressed/acting as old men.
5. If there was some mention during the commentary, or one of the documentaries somewhere on the 2 DVDs, along the lines of ""Oh, the Beatles were going to appear on this thing, but owing to legal reasons we can't use their likeness"", this would have at least been an acceptable apology. But it isn't. To paraphrase William Hartnell, ""NOT ONE LINE!"" Were the commenters forced to sign contracts that said they couldn't even mention the omission?
6. This is pure corporate greed, plain and simple, on someone's part. Either the BBC trying to save money, or EMI, Apple or whoever owns the rights to the clip.
7. If the outrage becomes big enough, the BBC will be either forced to pony up the dough to restore the rights, or the clip owner will be persuaded to relent. Either way it means the BBC will likely release another version of this DVD.

This is the only review I have ever given where I said, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's time we struck a blow against corporate control of content.

Meanwhile, I quite enjoyed ""The Space Museum"" and would recommend it if it weren't carrying such controversial baggage with it.",1278633600,18,1895,4.617210682492582

4114045,1,B003EGDDLA,"Thank you to all who rated this 1 star. I noticed the low rating and checked to see what the deal was. After discovering there is a scene cut out, I will not buy this version. I just ordered a copy from the UK. I have a region free DVD player that plays PAL format, so that is no problem. With the current exchange rate of a $1.51 per GBP, it comes out cheaper, which offsets the extra shipping cost. So you don't even have to pay more for it.

After doing some research this is the worst edit by far, as they actually cut a whole scene out. The next worst is ""Remembrance of the Daleks"". The Beatles songs have been replaced. No actual scene cut though. They just used different songs. However the special edition DVD is under 6 pounds on the UK Amazon, so I figure, what the hell.

There are other song edits as well, but they are very minor. Like a song clip from ""Revelation of the Daleks"" got changed to something else. You could hear this Fleetwood Mac song in the background in the first factory scene in ""Spearhead from Space"". It was just a minor thing in the background and was replaced with more of the machine sound effects. So hardly a big deal.

So, bottom line, if you import anything, make it ""The Chase"".",1277596800,16,1221,4.254310344827586

This makes little sense to me, because the American video release has the scene intact. (I wonder if it has anything to do with the current state of the catalog being in the hands of Michael Jackson's ""heirs"")

I will be buying this release (if for nothing more than the extras), and will be waiting to see if the hype about said scene holds up. It probably will.

However, it is tough for me to write a review for the actual product when I do not have a copy of my own yet. Neither does anyone else, yet. Please keep this in mind before you judge it. Then, use your own opinion.

4114050,5,B003EGDDLA,The Chase was a wonderful Doctor Who episode. I find it sad that so many people gave such a fantastic episode one star just because some Beatles stock footage was removed. Sure that was a cute scene but I don't see taking it down to one star it's not as though the scene was vital to the plot. Personally I loved finding out why the Mary Celeste was a ghost ship. That scene alone is worth buying the DVD. It's a very fun episode the humor is intentional. It is also a very important episode because in the end we say goodbye to the Doctor's very first human companions. A little note for the younger fans neither of these two companions were in love with the Doctor or running away from their wedding day.,1272585600,7,706,4.276119402985074

Regardless of how small that scene was, or how little it had to do with the actual story, the fact that it was there was a big selling point for me. It's the ONLY footage of that performance left.  Plus, I like to have the have the complete story on my DVDs, if I wanted things cut I would just watch regular TV with commercials.  I was also extremely excited about this story, I've never seen it and I'm coming to like the first doctor a lot, but no way am I buying it unless it's complete, for the money we're expected to shell out for these things.  I don't see why fans over here should have to miss out on a scene just because we were born on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.  I don't have a region-free DVD player, so I will not be buying this at all.  Thanks, BBC, for making me miss out on a story I was excited about, but you miss out on my money from it, so we're even.

NOTE: When I found out about this, I also found out that the American release of Remembrance of the Daleks had a Beatles song cut out of it as well.  I did not know this when I bought it, and am annoyed that I now have an edited version of that story.  Shouldn't edited releases be marked as such?",1272240000,19,1344,3.985074626865672
4114053,4,B003EGDDLA,"I feel obligated to write a review .. and give it about a star more than I would otherwise, just to counter all the 1-star reviews that focus solely on what ISN'T there -- a brief snippit of a scene in the TARDIS that really takes nothing away from the plot or storyline.

Let's face it -- even for 'serious fans' ""The Chase"" is not the Mona Lisa.  It's a runaround which serves to demonstrate mostly that Terry Nation had decided to see if there was anything he COULDN'T get away with -- as long as it had Daleks in it. It is a story best enjoyed with a bottle of wine and a group of good friends.

The storyline, such as it is, involves the Daleks pursuing the Doctor and friends through Space and Time, narrowly missing them as they have adventures on the top of the Empire State Building, through haunted houses  and on Terry's trademark Jungle Worlds and Desert Worlds. Special effects and sets are laughable, acting by non-regulars staggeringly awful, Billy-fluffs abundant and the plot, as noted, non-existant.  But as the story which bids farewell to Ian and Barbara, it IS a must for any serious fan.

The Space Museum is somewhat interesting in that it is one of the few stories that uses Time Travel as an aspect of the plot, rather than as a device to get our heroes to their next adventure.  That aside, it's a fairly slow-moving tale which (I'll confess) I remember little about, not having watched my video copy for several years now.

4114054,1,B003EGDDLA,"I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, and I've put up with a lot from the BBC on this, but this is the final straw! First they chose to throw away the show in the 1970s, destroying master tapes until FANS stood up to them and made them stop! Then they refuse to release this show in season box sets like all other shows so we have to buy each individual story to own the entire 26 season run. Then they release only a few stories a year, drawing out the DVD releases over a decade and still not even close to finished. Then they won't release animated episodes or reconstructions, leaving it up to fans to do so themselves AND at risk of the BBC stopping them from doing so due to copyright infringement.

NOW they release what can ONLY be called an EDITED and INCOMPLETE version of this story! This story contains some extremely rare footage of the Beatles performing on Top of the Pops, it remains the ONLY footage of this performance still in existence because, once again THE BBC DESTROYED ALL THEIR OLD TAPES. Well this DVD version DOESNT include this footage because the BBC chose not to pursue getting the rights or just cheaped out on this release. Don't be fooled by anyone telling you this is only a few seconds of the episode, as the scene not only includes the actual footage of the Beatles, but also the characters dancing to the song and discussing it for a few minutes, so we're missing SEVERAL minutes of an episode because of this, and one of more memorable classic Who moments!

The story revolves around the TARDIS jumping a time track and the Doctor and his companions being out of time sync for a bit and then the story proceeds on how to prevent things they saw when they were out of phase. The Moraks were pretty weak and the rebels a bit lame and that drags the story down in my opinion. It still is pretty good overall however and gets 4 stars.

The Chase is a six part story which has the Daleks following the Doctor through time in their own time machine.  While I found it entertaining, it was kind of a minor clinker for Terry Nation. It had the chance of being much better than it turned out.  I was confused by the fact that at each location, the Doctor and companions went out exploring while the Daleks kept closing the time gap between them.  The last two episodes I felt were the strongest of this story and the weakest was the haunted house episode which they probably could have cut without losing anything in the story.
