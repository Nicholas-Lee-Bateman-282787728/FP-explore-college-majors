1232017,1,B00000JGJB,"I am one of the people shown in this video.
Before you buy it, I strongly suggest that you find my Bible codes web page and read the long critique of this video that appears there.
You will find that the video  got many basic facts wrong, and did not have any of the ""balance""  that it so proudly proclaims.
If you still want to buy it after that, go  ahead.",940118400,13,358,4.014084507042254

7911996,5,B00000JGJB,"God has written to us secret messages in the bible which can only be accessed via computers. It is sort of like secret codes. Men in Israel and the Pentagon are looking for answers to modern day events. People like Hitler, Sadaam Hussein, Princess Diana and J.F. Kennedy are in there. With more advanced technology maybe you and I will be found in there also. I highly recommend this.",1358899200,,384,4.579710144927536
7911997,5,B00000JGJB,"This DVD talkS about FORENSIC EVIDENCE that cannot be argued with, no matter how many fits you chuck. Further, given a choice between 10 Jewish scientists and 10 Christian Pastors who disagree...I'll take the scientists, thank you.",1176681600,3,231,5.27027027027027
7911998,1,B00000JGJB,"One of the foundational qualities of the Bible is its clarity (sometimes called perspicuity). That means Scripture's main teachings are plain enough to be understood without the need of special expertise or church-sanctioned interpretations.

The Bible frequently speaks about its own clarity. Psalm 119:130 says, ""The unfolding of Thy words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple."" The average person who humbly reads the Bible can say, ""I have more insight than all my teachers, for Thy testimonies are my meditation"" (Psalm 119:99). Psalm 19:7 teaches, ""The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.""

The idea of hidden codes in the Bible contradicts all of that by limiting accessibility to the real message of the Bible to so-called experts who can decipher the cryptic messages God ""hid"" in the Scriptures. But such ""experts"" aren't needed because the Bible contains no hidden codes.

One hidden-code theory works like a common word-search puzzle-hidden messages are supposedly embedded diagonally within the Hebrew text. But that's as foolish as turning your daily newspaper into a word-search puzzle and expecting to find meaningful stories hidden in it. Newspapers aren't written to convey messages in secret code, and neither was the Bible. Both should be read using ordinary rules of language.

Of course there are concepts in the Bible that are hard to understand-even the apostle Peter admitted that (2 Peter 3:15). But the way to discover the meaning of those hard passages is not by seeking out hidden messages, but by engaging in diligent study that accurately handles the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15).

Take heart! The Bible is clear and even the most untrained reader can understand it. God wants you to understand the Bible, and He has provided the Holy Spirit as a guide (John 16:13). After all, ""man does not live by bread alone, but...by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD"" (Deuteronomy 8:3).",1116547200,4,1960,5.1125
7911999,4,B00000JGJB,The book is great.  The documentary was short but gave a lot to think about that was hard to concive from the book.  I do not own the Dvd's but i watched them before.  The documentary was great.  Both my family and I watched the Dvd and thought them great.  Every one needs watch this.  But the books are better.,1043107200,7,312,4.116666666666666
7912000,3,B00000JGJB,"When I was first asked to review this DVD by a friend I wanted to decline, but watched it anyway. It was my personal opinion that you can make anything say anything if you try hard enough.
  The impression that I got afterward was that there were some very genuine people out there with far more expertise than I have in encoding and mathmatics that had found something extraordinary within the Hebrew text.  So I have have elevated my opinion somewhat. There is no way I am going to be able to understand fully encryption methods..and debunkers use people's inability to grasp the mathematic concepts as a way to blast the whole thing.
 I figure ""out of the mouth of two or three witnesses"" (add credible to that) all things will be established. These people seem competent, sincere, and not glory hounds, so I am left to think about it and wish that it would be indeed provable and acceptable in the scientific community.  I would love theology and science to come together on something!
  Over all if a DVD gives me ANYTHING to think about it is good. It is short documentary...and doesn't need two DVD's to show, but I didn't regret the time viewing it.",1022976000,10,1157,4.5603864734299515
7912001,2,B00000JGJB,"This DVD, as a documentary, is very poor - conceptually and technically. First the mundane details: It appears as a ""box set"" with 2 DVD's, but each one of them only contains 45 minutes with none of the usual ""bonus"". The film itself is very unbalanced, promising way more the it delivers and mixing solid scientific research with some very questionable messianic claims. The subject itself is fascinating. Watch the DVD if you have to, but your time would be better spent reading the original book by Michael Drosnin...",997747200,5,520,4.853932584269663
7912002,1,B00000JGJB,"Another product milking the discredited psuedo-science of numerology, but if you're the uncritical, airy-fairy type that believes in whatever comes down the pike, you'll probably be slack-jawed in amazement throughout  Secrets of the Bible Code Revealed.
Want to distance yourself from  pseudo-scientific  thinking?  Pick up a copy of Sagan's Demon-Haunted World  or this month's Skeptic or Skeptical Inquirer magazine.",957916800,6,419,6.033898305084746
7912003,5,B00000JGJB,This documentary on the pioneering discoveries of the equidistant letter sequence codes in the text of the Hebrew Bible is an intriguing introduction to a fascinating subject.  Even though Bible code research has  advanced rapidly - even in the past year - this video is still a valuable  preface for anyone unfamiliar with what the codes involve and what their  implications are for us today. The viewer should keep in mind that this is  beginner level material in a subject that has advanced far in a short time.  I highly recommend it for starters.,944179200,32,551,4.808510638297872
7912004,1,B00000JGJB,The video in question is purportedly a balanced account on the Bible code controversy. It is anything but.  It provides forum for a number of code proponents while denying it to the code opponents.  It competely distorts  the real story about the alleged discovery of the code and about the  ongoing dispute.,940377600,4,308,4.865384615384615
