119177,5,0790745003,"FOOTLIGHT PARADE is the last of the great Warner Brothers musical ""trilogy"" of 1933 along with 42ND STREET and GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933.  In my opinion, it is the best of the series, and grossing in over $700,000 (a staggering amount for depression era films), apparently the viewers of 1933 found it to be a real treat as well.
Chester Kent (James Cagney) is a down-and-out-of-luck stage producer when he finds himself out of a job (ironically, via motion pictures).  To make matters worse, his wife leaves him and his agents (Guy Kibbee and Arthur Hohl) don't need him anymore.  All of this in the first five minutes of the film!
Kent gets a breakthrough idea: putting on one pre-picture prologue may cost a bundle, but if you tour the country with that one prologue, it will pay for itself practically!  Soon, he has an entire establishment including his right hand gal Nan (Joan Blondell), stenographer turned tap dancer Bea Thorne (Ruby Keeler), a singing college romeo Scotty (Dick Powell), a hypochondriac director (Frank McHugh) and a mischievous censor (Hugh Herbert).  All of this in the next ten minutes of the film!!
After a while, the company starts to really take off, that is until Kent gets a little competition that steals his ideas.  Suddenly, a grand chain deal worth tens of thousands arrives, and three shows to be produced in three days.  Add on top of that some romantic interest and you've got a real crowd pleaser.  Could anyone else but Warner Brothers pull it off?  I think not.
The main numbers in this film, all Al Dubin/Harry Warren or Sammy Fain/Irving Kahal, which means quality.  The first couple of numbers (""Ah, The Moon is Here"" and ""Sittin' On a Backyard Fence"") are toe-tappers, but fall a little flat.  Busby Berkely's genius direction isn't realized until the final three numbers: ""Honeymoon Hotel"", a romp through a hotel specializing in newlywed sweets, filled with dozens of scantilly clad women, ""By A Waterfall"", a kaleidoscopic synchronized swimming number complete with a 50,000 gallon-per-minute waterfall (all on a Broadway stage, I might add) and the real show-stopper, ""Shanghai Lil"", in which Jimmy Cagney tap-dances the pants off of Ruby Keeler.
The pacing as one might assume from this review is extremely fast, which makes multiple viewing of this film enjoyable.  Lloyd Bacon was known well as a director that believed in fast pacing, and this leaves lines filled with pre-code gems that can be picked up on later screenings of the film.
Almost every part is cast perfectly, with some of the best selection being that of Dick Powell as the carooning college boy, aiming for Ruby Keeler's affection (and vice-versa), Frank McHugh as a nervous, cigar chewing director, and Hugh Herbert as a jittery brother of a backer/state censor.  Paul Porcasi has a funny role as a theater owner with a chronic case of indigestion.  Also look for two cameos by Billy Barty as a mouse in the Kitten number and as a child in the Honeymoon Hotel number.
The quality of Warner's VHS video edition is quite top notch.  Film elements are quite good, although a little rough near reel changes, and the Vitaphone soundtrack is also clear and clean, except for the occasional edit marks which can be heard when there is little dialogue or background sound.  Since it's in black and white, it's a bit clearer than a color film, and there's no problems that you could run into on that level.
I would personally love to see this released as a DVD edition, which it just may, but if you're out to see this, buy this one as soon as you can.",1059868800,13,3563,4.769105691056911
119178,5,0790745003,"A rollicking funfest with snappy performances from Cagney and Blondell, this film is a close tie with GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933 as being the most entertaining of all thirties musical extravaganzas. As Chester Kent, the dynamic & successful producer of musical comedies, Jimmy Cagney emits such zestful enthusiasm that his performance is exhilarating to watch. As his loyal, vital and loveably wise-cracking secretary Nan Prescott -who secretly carries a torch for him - Joan Blondell shines: their chemistry together is infectous. As Scotty Blair, Dick Powell displays his let's-annoy-with-corn-and-youth charm as he wins over the equally corny - but strangely appealing, somehow - Ruby Keeler as Bea Thorn. It must be noted that these two characters were meant to be rather saccharine even back in 1933: cutesy + risque = big box-office during the depths of the depression. Ruby Keeler, of the uniquely whiney voice & rather clunky tap-dancing wasn't much of an actress, but she was DIFFERENT & the Canadian-born wife of Al Jolson was a hit with audiences. Notes for trivia fans: the film which is seen playing early in the film - when Kent visits a theatre - is an early John Wayne western entitled THE TELEGRAPH TRAIL (Warner Bros. 1933) * Watch closely for John Garfield making his film debut as an extra in the SHANGHAI LIL number. Favourite line: Fed-up Blondell to the phoney Claire Dodd - ""As long as there's a sidewalk, you'll never be out of work!"" A fast & cheeky pre-code musical with astonishing Busby Berkeley numbers, this film is a historical delight for fans of the genre to relish.",1045958400,4,1593,4.9700374531835205
119179,4,0790745003,"James Cagney stars as a producer of prologues, which are short live musical numbers that precede talking films.  He is ably assisted by his secretary, Joan Blondell, who is obviously in love with him without his knowledge.  Dick Powell plays one of his performers who falls in love with Ruby Keeler, an office assistant who also blossoms into a performer.  Other members of the Warners Stock Company are along for the ride, including Frank McHugh, Guy Kibbee, Ruth Donnelly, Hugh Herbert, and Claire Dodd.  Cagney is having problems putting together his prologues, being cheated by his partners, and the women in his life other than Blondell are taking him for a ride too.  Cagney is in great form here, dominating (as usual) every scene he is in, including his dance number in the film's final musical sequence.  Blondell gives yet another likeable performance, tossing off the one-liners yet giving her character some heart.  I usually find Powell a bit irritating, and he holds true to form in this film, while Keeler's acting and dancing seem clunkier than usual.  But Powell and Keeler can be easily overlooked by the spectacle of Berkeley's musical numbers, the solid, quick direction of Lloyd Bacon, and by Cagney's star performance.  It's a shame that Warner Brothers didn't give Cagney a few more roles like this one that fully show his amazing talent.  His fans will definitely want to catch this film.",1036281600,8,1412,4.944915254237288
119180,5,0790745003,"It is difficult to believe that this musical is almost 70 years old.  The vitality, snappy dance numbers, dialogue, and sexual tension all seem remarkably up-to-date.
The cast is uniformly excellent.  James Cagney gets most of the attention in the reviews I've read, and he is excellent. However, my favorites in the cast are Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler.  Just looking at them crooning, spooning, trading quips, and dancing is nostalgia itself.
My two favorite Busby Berkely numbers are ""Sitting on The Back Fence"" and ""Shanghai Lil.""

I love every minute of this movie, but the icing on the cake is the  ""Shanghai Lil"" sequence.  If you've never seen Cagney do anything  but gangsters, you must see him as an absolutely adorable, dancing, singing  ""gob"". And, the ""Shanghai Lil"" music is performed in so  many styles thoughout this final sequence that you can't get it out of your  head.

119202,5,0790745003,"If one could encapsulate the Busby Berkeley musical extravaganzas of the 1930s, FOOTLIGHT PARADE would surely place in the top three. Americans at that time had been suffering through the worst of the Great Depression and in increasing numbers sought the release of the talkies coming out of Hollywood.  For a brief spell, they could look up at the big screen and stare entranced at the mlange of singing, dancing, and top notch acting.  The marquee stars James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell were all of recent vintage but in the few years prior to 1933 had already made their marks as the elite. For those who look today at films like this one it takes some cultural re-integration to appreciate exactly what made millions of film goers buy tickets to forget the humiliation of bread lines and no jobs.  But in the years following the Crash, it was personalities that made superstars. Cagney is Chester Kent, a Broadway show producer who is determined to give New York a powerhouse of a musical. His essential screen persona of the tough guy had already resonated with audiences. He mugs, pushes, wise cracks, and even hoofs his way in nearly every scene. Cagney's style was light years from the controlled undertones of more traditional actors like Lawrence Olivier but the impact of Cagney and his ability to reach out from the screen to grab audiences on their collective labels has never been equaled. The stage universe of FOOTLIGHT PARADE as ably directed by Lloyd Bacon is one of non-stop crisis and chaos. In nearly every scene Cagney has to resolve disputes, emergencies, and disloyalties in a manner that audiences soon see as the glue holding all the revolving actor planets in their assigned orbits. Joan Blondell is Nan, who loves him but in her he sees only an able and trusted secretary. Blondell very nearly does the cinematic impossible; in her own wise cracks and dirty looks she is the counter point to Cagney with him not seeing her for who and what she is, a woman who will love and protect him from all sides. She uncovers two of Cagney's associates embezzling him. She reveals a scheming tramp who wants to marry Cagney as the trollop that somehow he fails to spot. Throughout the film, Cagney continually misreads those around him. Despite his aggressive in your face manner of bending others to his will, he learns that his real enemies are those closest to him. There is a subplot involving Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell who meet fall in love and sing in chorus at the drop of a hat.  And then there are the musical numbers of Busby Berkeley. These numbers are stand alone set pieces, with each piece occurring every few minutes. The visual impact of mass leg kicking is immense and visceral. Berkeley pulls out all the stops with traditional chorus routines allied with some truly stunning synchronized swimming extended scenes. It takes some patience for moderns to sit through them all without wondering what the point was. This point is the difference between audiences then and now. In the 1930s, movie patrons wanted to see the unusual choreography that only Berkeley could produce. FOOTLIGHT PARADE them is far more than cinematic entertainment.  It is a time machine that permits moderns with short attention spans to stare at a screen and feel what their grandparents surely must have--that music and dance can inevitably find their way into our collective souls.",1428710400,,3419,4.837606837606837

I did find it rather disturbing to view such a sleazy perv in a perfectly disguised 4 year old, yikes, wonder what happened to his career??? could not comprehend the buzz about Ruby, surprised they didn't let Ginger do more, but maybe Jolson had a bit to do with that..... and the biggest shock was the Kitty Kat routine that must have been a great inspiration for the egads long run of CATS on broadway, how many times have I seen this pilfering of 70yo plots only to be viewed as an original in a more current version, so much for creativity, sez lots bout the genius that is the birth of creation, high recommend for cagney fans and busby musical visuals, now that's a genius!! enjoy....",1367712000,,1130,4.626865671641791

Mainly I bought this to enjoy Cagney's dancing and the lavish musical numbers the likes of which you don't see anywhere anymore.

119223,5,0790745003,"""Footlight Parade"" (1933) is the best of the ""Big 3"" early '30's Warners' musicals.

""42nd St."" (1932) and ""Golddiggers of 1933"" (1933) were both gems, both wonderful, but the smoothest and most complete, and most advanced of the ""Big 3"" early '30's Warners musicals is ""Footlight Parade"" (1933).

James Cagney is the star of show, and his talent is immense.....he really was a true top level movie star, outshining all of his fellow movie stars in every show he ever acted in.

This is a ""pre-code"" movie which pokes fun at the censorship organizations set up across the USA and the ""on the set"" cops who were supposed to keep the movies ""moral"" but didn't yet face the Joe Breen/ Will Hayes office, which didn't kick in until the following year (1934).

The adult humor in the ""Honeymoon Hotel"" sequence (the first of the 3 big production numbers at the end of the movie) is wonderful, and never seen again, or done as well.

The aquacade photography and production part of the ""By A Waterfall"" sequence (the second of the 3 big production numbers at the end of the movie) is lovely, tasteful, and breathtaking, and also never repeated as well again. The Esther Williams movies and other ""water ballet"" efforts were never matched by the one in ""Footlight Parade"" (1933).

James Cagney's wonderful dancing and electric presence make the ""Shanghai Lil"" sequence (the 3rd of the 3 big production numbers at the end of the movie) wonderful, and seem to inspire Ruby Keeler, his lady dance partner in that sequence, to do the best dancing and acting she ever did in any movie (and her other movies were also wonderful).

This movie is one of the precious examples of big time Hollywood movie musicals at their very, very best.

The VHS cassette which contained ""Footlight Parade"" (1933) I got and screened also included a 1934 Warner Brothers color cartoon titled ""Honeymoon Hotel,"" the same song seen and heard in the ""Footlight Parade"" (1933).

The cartoon is very well done, set in ""Bugtown"" and danced and sung by cartoon bugs, and also includes quick snippet ""homages"" to other songs from Warner Brothers musicals, but mainly is a spoof about the ""Honeymoon Hotel"" song ......all sung and danced by cartoon bugs.

One of the great, classic early cartoons, and one of the earliest color cartoons.

119224,5,0790745003,"Footlight Parade (1933) benefits greatly from the presence of actors James Cagney and Joan Blondell. Wisely, the film omits the coy indulgences of Busby Berkeley regulars Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, relegating them to the sidelines and musical numbers. Directed by Lloyd Bacon and choreographed by Berkeley, the film echoes Cagney's rapid-fire delivery. It is often ranked as Berkeley's best overall film.

The early 1930s were an era in which musicals and westerns pretty much ruled the roost, as far as quantity goes. As far as quality, with so many being produced, the bulk of Hollywood's musicals, like their westerns, were wretched. MGM had a bigger reputation for musicals, but their Thirties' output was predominantly tame fluff, and few have withstood the test of time. The grittier Warner Brothers productions, somewhat predictably, did it better, in no small part due to Busby Berkeley.

This is another ""puttin' on the show"" extravaganza.  The advent of sound has put an end to silent films in the midst of the Depression. Producer Cagney feels compelled to keep his crew fed and working, so he racks his brain for ideas. He arrives at the concept of ""musical prologues"" to introduce talkies. Cagney is a Berkeley-like character who has to contend with a scheming ex-wife, a back-stabbing fellow producer (Guy Kibbe), and a planted temptress mole (the quite good Claire Dodd). This cast of characters serve as much needed antagonists for the hyper-intense Cagney to bounce off of.

Joan Blondell perfectly parallels Cagney. She is his snappy secretary of substance who secretly loves him. She is no push-over, and, displaying as much energy as her boss, she  exposes his crooked partner, saves him from the gold-digging Dodd, and  serves as his sounding board. Blondell damn near steals the whole film from Cagney, and that's no easy feat. Her tough, no-nonsense humor gets the better of Dodd, and she sends her rival packing with a swift kick to the daily duties: ""as long as there is a sidewalk, you'll have a job!""  We're almost as miffed as she is with Cagney for not seeing the obvious. Cagney's persona was as easily at home in the musical as he was in the gangster melodrama. And, like fellow celluloid gangster George Raft, Cagney was a skilled dancer. We root for Cagney, we root even more for Blondell, and we root for them to connect. This is Hollywood in the 1930s so, rest assured, we will not be disappointed. Keeler and Powell, in secondary roles, are likable and charming. Keeler is the nerd who gets made over by Blondell and emerges as Cagney's star dancer (her dancing had improved considerably since 42nd Street).

""Sittin' on the Backyard Fence"" is a brief amiable number with Keeler as an amorous kitty and dwarf star Billy Barty as a mischievous rodent. The three real musical numbers come later. The first of these is ""Honeymoon Hotel,"" which is exactly what it sounds like. It is a naughty romp that celebrates the potential of marital bliss (Keeler and Powell) and slyly pokes fun of the puzzling fact that ""no one stops here, unless their name is Smith!"" A frilly blonde operator sings, ""I hear things I would never dare to tell!"" A French maid muses that ""the honeymoon suite is never idle."" Stuffy old women in an elevator are scandalized over the obvious amorous enthusiasm of Keeler and Power. A bell hop, who looks remarkably like Matthew Broderick, is a little too anxious to get the honeymooners to their suite. Alas, unannounced relatives show up to douse the heat in Powell's slacks. The poor man is ready to burst, but as soon as he gets the intrusive kin out the door, a mix-up with a buxom blonde and Billy Barty in the hall serve as stop signs to consummation. This is clearly pre-Hayes code cinema with the winky hanky-panky in overdrive.

""If this doesn't get them, nothing will"" Cagney tells Blondell, and we can only concur when transported to the deliriously outlandish""By the Waterfall."" While most of Berkeley's work is sexually charged, little of it is actually erotic. This one is. Powell's dream of love and marriage to Keeler morphs into what many people consider quintessential Berkeley. It is, perhaps, the closest classic Hollywood gets to experimental cinema. A towering waterfall cascades atop  a surrealistically gargantuan stage. An aquashow of mermaids dive and swim in and under the water, forming synchronized, geometric patterns. We view them from Berkeley's breath-taking overhead shots and extreme cheesecake close-ups. This is downright subversive choreography, cinematic insemination. The sequence is long, but never feels it; it never wastes a second.

""Shanghi-Li"" descends into radically different territory. Cagney (at the last second, replacing a drunken star) shows off his hoofer skills and still retains his tough guy persona. He stumbles into an opium den, populated with prostrate, scantily clad ladies of ill-repute and bristly addicts, while looking for his Shanghai Lil (Keeler). Inter-racial romance, drugs and liquor are the ingredients topped with a naval send-off.

Footlight Parade has the same knee-jerking pace as films like His Girl Friday (1940), but its the acting of Blondell and Cagney along with the songs of Warren & Dubin and Berkeley's outstandingly obsessive work that carries it into classic status.

119226,4,0790745003,"Footlight Parade is a 30s Busby Berkeley musical starring Jimmy Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell.

Busby Berkeley (1895-1976) was a director and choreographer whose work in the 1930s and early 40s dominated screen musicals. His use of complex geometric patterns captivated audiences. He began on Broadway and transitioned to films with Eddie Cantor. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (1936, 7, and 8) but never won. His hits included ""42nd Street"" (1933), ""Gold Diggers of 1933"" ""Gold Diggers of 1935"", and ""Babes on Broadway"" (1941). He also directed non-musicals and has to his credit such films as ""They Made me a Criminal"" (1939) and ""Fast and Furious"" (1939).

Jimmy Cagney (1989-1986) was one of the greatest film actors. AFI lists him as #8. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" in 1938 and won for his 1942 portrayal of George M Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"".  While he is best known for his gangster roles, the majority of Cagney's screen appearances were not as a gangster - he played  an insurance salesman (""The Millionaire"", 1931), an engineer (""Other Men's Women"", 1931),  a boxer (""Winner Take All"", 1932), an auto racer (""The Crowd Roars"", 1932), etc. Indeed, Cagney often appeared in comedies (e.g., ""Here Comes the Navy"", ""Hard to Handle"", ""Jimmy the Gent""), although it was his gangster films that earned the really big bucks. In his own heart, however, Cagney was a hoofer (dance man), and ""Footlight Parade"" was a chance for him to do what he loved to do best. BTW - some of his dance routines in this film can be seen in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" which is a much better showcase for Cagney's dancing.

Joan Blondell (1906-79) appeared with Cagney several times prior to this film (""Maggie the Magnificent"", ""Penny Arcade"", ""Sinners Holiday"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Blonde Crazy""). Generally speaking she portrayed a wise cracking sex symbol, but she was capable of more serious roles in films like ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" (1945) and ""The Blue Veil"" (1951) for which she was nominated for an Oscar. She was also nominated twice for an Emmy and twice for a Golden Globe.

Ruby Keeler (1910-93) is best known for her musicals with Dick Powell (""42nd Street"", ""Gold Diggers of 1933"", ""Dames"", ""Flirtation Walk"", ""Colleen""). She was the wife of super star Al Jolson from 1928 to 1940.

Dick Powell's (1904-63) early career was in musical comedy, but  in the 40s he starred in a series of film noir movies as detective Philip Marlowe and slowly transitioned into a producer and director in TV (""Four Star Playhouse"") and in films (""The Enemy Below"", ""The Conqueror""). He was married to co-star Joan Blondell from 1936 to 1944.

Frank McHugh (1898-1981) provided comic relief to over 100 films. He was part of the original ""Irish Mafia"" and appeared in a dozen films with fellow mafia member Jimmy Cagney and 13 films with mafia member Pat O'Brien.

Guy Kibbee's (1882-1956) round face and burly voice are known from more than 100 films between 1931 and 1950. He played the Governor in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939).

Look closely and you'll see such future stars as Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus.

Lloyd Bacon (1889-1955) directs. He worked in several genres, including musical comedy (""42nd Street""), war films  (""Action in the North Atlantic"", ""The Fighting Sullivans""), drama (""Invisible Stripes"", ""A Slight Case of Murder""), and westerns ""The Oklahoma Kid"". Most of his work was at Warner Brothers where he was known for bringing in films on time and under budget.

This is a great film. In some respects it is an early example of ""screwball comedies"" which it tends to resemble more in the first half, with the second half more clearly the musical section. Cagney is terrific, and his constant patter with Joan Blondell never gets old. If there is a weak link in the acting area it is Dick Powell, and his singing abilities make it clear that his future career changes were a good idea.

One of the Busby Berkeley numbers, ""By a Waterfall"", is one of the very best examples of Berkeley's technique.",1290470400,,4094,4.843839541547278

The production values are better due to the success of Gold Diggers of 1933 and 42nd Street, and the musical production numbers are out of sight!  James Cagney who was best known for Public Enemy was given a chance by Warner Brothers to do a musical and proved that he was a master of the genre.  His part was originally supposed to go to Fred Astaire and Cagney was able to prove he was capable.  While I have a soft spot for the looseness and fun of Gold Diggers of 1933, this film was given more money and expertise to put together the musical numbers and story.  All of the musical numbers are great, Honeymoon Hotel, Shanghi Lil and By A Waterfall, which features the swimming extravaganza that Busby Berkley would take to even greater heights with the Esther Williams films.

119229,4,0790745003,"This movie has GREAT musical numbers. The waterfall sequence alone, which pre-dates, and surely inspired the entire career of Esther Williams makes it historically interesting.
Aside from that, there is a proximity in the stylization, to silent film. One of the most humorous aspects of the movie is that when the model-singer-dancer beauties open their mouth the contrasty between the sophisticated glamor of the Big city and their trailer-suburbia accents is divine. Perhaps nowhere is it more accentuated or hilarious than in James Cagney's love interest, Joan Blondell whose photo should be in the dictionary next to the word ""Broad"". She is a tough gal with a Southern Staten islandish accent that could transform pure silk into flawless polyester with a few vowels. She pushes and shoves her way into Cagney's heart like a barracuda in Spring heat, and wears the most outlandishly horrid gowns ever, perfect for a funeral home's receptionist.
James Cagney surprised me as a dancer. He has amazing fluidity of movement and his make up in this film reminded me of Alia Nazimova's ""Camille"", specially the shadows around the eyes, which are amazing. He could have done a Dr. Caligari remake between scenes!
""Shanghai Lil"" is another musical treat, complete with opium den odalisques. ""The Love Hotel"" is a ridiculous musical number,in its posturing goodie-two-shoes innocence that is just completely over the top. It is also hilarious to watch for that very reason.
This film is pure undiluted fun, a period piece. Strongly recommended for musical lovers.",1248912000,3,1558,5.211155378486056
119230,5,0790745003,"FOOTLIGHT PARADE is a first-rate musical that should please all. Even after 75 years, Busby Berkeley's musical numbers still amaze and entertain. True, those last three back-to-back numbers could never have appeared in a theatre, but they're still knockouts by any standards. Besides the aforementioned Mr. Cagney, Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, Guy Kibbee, Frank McHugh and Dick Powell all shine. You can't miss with this one!",1227571200,4,424,5.4393939393939394
119231,5,0790745003,"Footlight Parade is one of the best early musicals starring the great Jimmy Cagney, Ruby Keeler, and Joan Blondell. Dick Powell also turns in a great performance and his singing is superb. The song and dance numbers by Busby Berkeley are nothing short of incredible; and the plot moves along at a good pace.

The action begins when Chester Kent (Jimmy Cagney) is struggling to put on prologues, small shows as opening numbers on a stage just before a movie theater showed an early ""talkie film."" Chester must contend with his two swindling bosses Silas 'Si' Gould (Guy Kibbee) and Al Frazer (Arthur Hohl) and worse yet there's a rat in the company giving all their inside plans to a competing firm that also puts on prologues.

Of course, the plot goes deeper still. Chester's wife Cynthia (Renee Whitney) wants a divorce. Moreover, Joan Blondell plays Nan Prescott, Chester's devoted secretary who loves him even though Chester himself doesn't realize it. There are also great performances by Claire Dodd as the gold digging Vivian Rich who dates Chester strictly for his money and Ruby Keeler plays Bea Thorn, a drab secretary who gets a stunning makeover to try to get into one of the prologues.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Will Chester ever discover that his bosses Gould and Frazer are cheating him of his pay? What would happen if Chester does find out? Chester is smitten with the superficial Vivian; but will he ever be free of his wife and see that Nan is the only woman who truly loves him? What about that spy inside the company--how will they ever find out who it is and put a stop to their ideas being leaked to their competitors? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

The choreography by Busby Berkeley can't be beat; and the cinematography is unparalleled.

Overall, Footlight Parade stuns you with some rather good acting, a juicy plot with action and unforgettable musical numbers lavishly created by the immortal Busby Berkeley. I highly recommend this film for aficionados of classic movie musicals.",1201305600,2,2050,4.829059829059829

The musical numbers designed by Busby Berkeley are outstanding and the final number ""Shangai Lil"" is a pleasure for moviegoers and especially if they are Cagney's fans like myself.... After seeing this movie you can understand why Jimmy Cagney would won an Oscar for Yankee Doodle Dandy nine years later, his role as Chester Kent is an anticipation of his George Cohan role...The performances by the rest of the cast are excelent especially Joan Blondell who shines as Jimmy's Assistant...

(Keeler is also lovely, even though she may not have been a great actress). While most musical movies happen in a neverland place, this at least try to put itself in its particular time and place (the Great Depression). There's a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today, much less in the usually stilted 30s films, even though the plot, involving the setting up of movies prologues, is quite dated.

119235,5,0790745003,"At the height of the Depression, Warner Brothers scored a hat trick with 3 memorable films in a year - ""42nd Street"", ""Golddiggers of 1933"" and ""Footlight Parade"".  Each was unique: the sombre coarseness and desperation of the first, the Depression theme and comedy of the second and the optimism of the third with reference to Roosevelt's New Deal.  ""Footlight Parade"" in particular had a sting in its tail which could be summed up in two words - James Cagney.  Cagney has quickly established his reputation as a gangster but his vaudeville training was on display for the first time in ""Footlight Parade"" and audiences were charmed and dazzled.

Cagney plays the producer of Prologues, live musical numbers to be shown on stage in theatres before the main feature. Joan Blondell, who complimented him perfectly, is his right hand girl. Their skill with the dialogue and obvious rapport is infectious. Other Warners regulars are on hand. Ruby Keeler plays a mousy secretary who removes her glasses to become a star and plays with tongue in cheek which is rarely acknowledged. She is funny and charming. Dick Powell is the usual love interest opposite Keeler and he is underrated, playing with that cheeky quality which always suggested a much wilder libido than appeared on the surface. Hugh Herbert has an hilarious part as a censor and it is obvious that Warners are having a crack at the Hays Code and its ineffectual and hypocritical presence. There are other great supporting actors but hilarious Ruth Donnelly is a standout as a ""sponsor"" of talent. Her  encounter with Keeler at a lunch counter is very funny.

The film climaxes with 3 musical numbers, all of which suggest Busby Berkeley's pre-occupation with sex. ""By a Waterfall"" is a visual spectacle of water babies and one can see the roots of Berkeley's water ballets with Esther Williams 20 years later. ""Honeymoon Hotel"" shows couples preparing for bed in a a hotel and would probably have incurred judicious cutting a year later when the Hays Code was imposed. ""Shangai Lil"" is the one where Cagney taps with Keeler. It is a pity the dance is so short, for they light up the screen briefly. The sets of a Shanghai dive and the depiction of drugs and prostitution are fascinating.

The print of the film is excellent and the DVD has some extraordinary extras. There is a competent documentary on the film and particulary the songwriters Dubin and Warren. There are 2 short films, focusing on radio and vaudeville. The radio stars are not so good, though Baby Rose Marie grew up to be a big star and you may remember her on the Dick Van Dyke show.  The vaudeville short is a keyhole glimpse into a form of entertainment that film eventually killed.  The acts are pretty good once you overcome any resistance to the medium.  One, in particular, has dancing cuties on a stairway of bells and just when you begin to think how corny, the sheer skill and charm of the act come through. It must have been a blast on a live stage. Finally, there are 2 excellent Merry Melodies based on 2 of the hit songs from the film. The combination of fun drawings and the superb orchestrations make for great entertainment.

The DVD is great value, particularly if it is purchased as part of the Busby Berkeley Set.",1170115200,2,3262,4.735449735449736
119236,5,0790745003,"Not so much a musical as a mating call set to music. But then what else could be expected from three back-to-back production numbers from that carnally-obsessed choreographer Busby Berkeley. ""Beside the Waterfall"" alone has enough `flowering o's', half-dressed chorines, and suggestive camera angles to make Hugh Hefner blush and send Dr. Freud into terminal overload. Then too, who else but the mad Mr. Berkeley could convert the complicated matter of sex into a mere conjugation of overhead geometry. There's also ""Honeymoon Hotel"", a celebration of the no-tell motel, with marching phalanxes of hormonally driven couples all named Smith, and led by a demonic cupid looking like an early Billy Barty. The sight of his tiny legs chasing after a fleeing Amazon is enough to drive Harpo Marx to distraction and cause the audience to doubt the laws of physics. While bringing down the curtain is the marching madness of ""Shanghai Lil"", where Berkeley proves-- in case you ever doubted-- that race, creed, and bad make-up make no difference to a Chinese bordello. It's sort of an early gathering of the UN, where people from all over come together to discuss the world's number one topic. All in all, there's enough sheer pizzaz, flash, and animal energy in these numbers to light up a thousand dark movie houses.

Sure, Warner Bros. tries to cover the orgy with the fig leaf of two cheerful innocents played by a sappy Dick Powell and a virginal Ruby Keeler. But it doesn't work, because everyone else gets in on the fun, including that human buzz-saw Jimmy Cagney and everyone's favorite sassy dame Joan Blondell. Director Lloyd Bacon proves too he knows what to do, giving us an eyeful of Blondell endlessly rolling and unrolling her hosiery, while the writers pepper the conversation with suggestive one-liners. Yeah, it's a great movie-- good enough to help bring down the heavy hand of censorship the following year, and put an end to damp dreams like ""Beside a Waterfall"". But not even the Watchdogs of Public Morality could stop Berkeley's deliriously suggestive pagentry that would live on at even that most repressed of studios, MGM. Sure, Astaire-Rogers may have been more graceful and a whole lot more chaste, no doubt producing more sheer polish-- still and all, don't let this unabashedly pagan celebration pass you by. As they say around the owl cage, it's a real hoot.",1168214400,8,2381,4.967418546365915
119237,4,0790745003,"Silent films are out and talking pictures are in, which means big musicals shows are going from stage to screen. A group of musical exhibitors are out of a job when one of them, Kent (James Cagney), gets a bright idea. Why not do musical previews like a chain store would to save money? They're in business and soon business is booming with beautiful girls, crazy ideas, and a great cast (Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Guy Kibbee).

The best part of this movie is the music done in Busby Berkeley style with a grand finale. First is ""Honeymoon Hotel,"" a snappy number about adultery and swapping partners in a sinful but fun hotel. It is eye-popping and fun, a story within the film starring Keeler and Powell. Next, the troupe runs off to another theater to put on the extravagant ""By a Waterfall"" with the same stars. This is probably the best example of typical Berkeley on overdrive; there is a giant waterfall surrounded by beautiful girls in, out, and by the water. It's a visual masterpiece! Not to be outdone, though, the finale is large in its own way. ""Shanghai Lil"" revolves around a scandalous subject, the red light district and the soldiers visiting. Cagney performs this one, quite well thanks to his vaudeville background. His dancing is a sight to see and his vocals aren't half bad. The giant settings of these numbers could never have been staged, but this aspect provides a type of spectacle that only film could provide. Enjoy!",1149379200,2,1459,4.69921875
119238,5,0790745003,"James Cagney, who up to this point was best known for his fast-talking, quick-witted feisty comedic performances, added song-and-dance man to his repertoire with this Busby Berkeley picture. He plays Chester Kent, who comes up with the idea of presenting ""prologues"" for movie theaters, where elaborate song-and-dance routines would be staged prior to a movie being shown. Rivals keep stealing his ideas, so he hides his troupe for three days, works out three numbers, and then performs them. The routines are your typical Busby Berkeley exercises in surrealism and sensual overkill, but Cagney is terrific in the ""Shanghai Lil"" number and the ""By a Waterfall"" routine is off the charts (the only thing missing is Esther Williams). Joan Blondell teams up with Cagney again (their sixth picture together), and she, of course, has some of the best (wisecracking) lines in the movie. Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler are also here.

I have to agree.  The non-musical segments are as good as the production numbers.  This is an amazing showcase for Joan Blondell and James Cagney, whose rapid fire 30's dialogue is something to behold.  The script is still funny, and quite racy as well (""I've met miss Bit....I mean RICH before"").

George Feltenstein at Warners has promised a Busby Berkeley boxed set DVD in 2005.  Lets hope this film gets some sort of restoration, and that they maybe throw on Berkeley numbers from lesser films (VARSITY SHOW, THE SINGING MARINE) as extras.",1102896000,12,730,4.846774193548387
119240,4,0790745003,"When people think of Busby Berkeley movies, The Goldiggers of 1933 and 1935 plus 42nd Street top the list.  This picture tends to get overlooked, but I have NEVER seen anything as transcendently wacko as the By A Waterfall number.  It helps that this was one of the last precode musicals, but if you think that sex was invented in 1963, you have not seen Berkeley's lizard brain- generated Fugue on a Theme by Sigmund Freud.  It's truly impossible to describe, but I fantasized about Leni and Joe catching this picture in a screening room at UFA and deciding that this would have to be the benchmark for next year's picture about the Nuremberg rally.
Other highlights in the picture include Jimmy Cagney blasting his way with explosive energy, Joan Blondell making a case as one of the unfrairly forgotten screen presences of the 1930s and of course the Honeymoon Hotel and Shanghai Lil sequences,  These would rate as oustanding in their own rights, but have the misfortune of being in the same picture as Waterfall.
Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler are an interesting case.  Keeler is a kind of depression glass artifact of the movies.  People loved her for her inadequacies.  Powell would have gone down in movie history as a somewhat de-testosteroned romantic tenor until he turned in a Philip Marlowe performance ten years later that surpassed Bogart playing the same character.  It's strange, but my memories of the later role shadow and add depth to the earlier operetta work, lending his sappy crooning about gushing liquids and embowerment at the honeymoon hotel a latent menace.
OK, so why not 5 stars?  The first hour of the picture is watchable, but suffers from the structural risk that the film took in staging all of the musical numbers in the last half hour.  See the first hour once, and you need not see it again. Although the Turner VHS print is quite good, a decent transfer to DVD would be a most excellent thing.

Answer:  Each time the song is in a different key.  When Mary has a go at it, it is in B-flat (as it is when Dick Powell and Frank McHugh demonstrate the piece in their hilarious duet).  When the opera singer who gets into her singing mood with perfume (""Forget the smell, honey; sing"") gives it a try, it is in C.  Finally, when the woman who wins the audition sings it, it is in G.

7791703,5,0790745003,"I loved Footlight parade. It was one of the numerous great Busby Berkeley films that came out throughout the 1930s and 1940s.  Many Busby films have a unique character that's only in that one and not others. 42nd Street had the wonderful Una Merkel, Gold diggers had the fun but scheaming Aline McMahon, and this film has the tough, comic James Cagney. Cagney was normally remembered for his tough gangster roles such as in Public enemy. Here he's slightly less dangerous due to him being a Broadway director instead of a gangster. Also we have again from the other films Hugh Hubert, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and the lovely Ruby Keeler (who is more a mousy looking bookworm towards the beginning of the film until Blondell gives her a makeover, surprises Cagney, and goes from a secretary to dancer (a funny line from Cagney ""another good girl gone bad""), and next scene we see her looking cute in a cat outfit dancing to the charming ""Sitting on a backyard fence"". I love Ruby's singing, and her talking, her sweetness, and her beauty. Cagney developed the interest of cats becoming part of the show, and brought in a real cat for inspiration.
Alot of good dancing numbers with beautiful dancing and singing girls are seen along the way such as ""Ah, the moon is here"" and  ""The prosperity unit"".  The wonderful show numbers are ""Honeymoon hotel"" (with scheaming baby looking Billy Barty), ""Shanghai lil"" (with Cagney and an Asain dressed Ruby dancing together), and the very best of all ""Like a waterfall"". That one was wondering and amazing all the way through with Powell, beautiful Ruby, and about 30 other beautifully swimming girls along to the very nice music and giving us some amazing patterns from the girls.

It is dated and may not appeal to some modern viewers looking for a modern movie experience.  However it is very enjoyable and a very interesting movie from the standpoint of Hollywood history.  Due to being pre production code, it is much more risqu than movies will be for many years afterward.

Some of the musical dance scenes, at the end of the musical are very ornate.  The most ornate scenes are choreographed and directed by Busby Berkeley.  Those most ornate scenes are vintage ""Busby Berkeley"".  Mr. Busby employs females as elements of art.  Some of the scenes look like a kaleidoscope.  It is very unique.

James Cagney was a serious mobster type character actor in Hollywood.  However he was a very gifted song and dance man.  He did not get to showcase those skills.  I am only guessing, but I suspect there was concern that the song and dance roles would be out of character for him and somehow that would compromise his tough guy image.  In any event, if one wishes one could watch this movie and then watch ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" produced approximately eight years later.  If one does so, one can easily see the James Cagney song and dance style.

There is one shot in this movie at the end, wherein there is a sailor character in a dance scene that appears to be John Garfield.  The shot is only one second long.  Supposedly it is not Mr. Garfield.  But it sure looks like him.
