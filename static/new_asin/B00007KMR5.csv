8185515,5,B00007KMR5,"I bought this twice and returned it twice from two different vendors. The product description said that the DVDs were in the NTSC video format, but actually they were in the PAL video format. The two covers are almost identical so it can easily be confused so look it over closely. They say the third time is a charm, but I'm not sure if I want to deal with another PAL disc.

I've seen this before which is why I'm giving it five stars. The picture and sound are just ok, but it is the music that I'm rating it by. If you like Gatemouth Brown then you should love this. Gatemouth and his band playing good music and having a good time doing it. I couldn't help but smile through the whole show.

I'd say that it falls between the Live from Austin Texas DVD and the Carlos Santana Presents Blues at Montreux 2004 DVD with the Montreux being best.",1317600000,4,846,4.248447204968944
