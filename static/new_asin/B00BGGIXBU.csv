5616417,5,B00BGGIXBU,I wish all Betty Grable movies were available on DVD. Lucky for me my dear darling enjoys them as much as I do.,1389312000,4,111,3.869565217391304
5616418,5,B00BGGIXBU,How can you possibly go wrong with any film starring Betty Grable? I think this is one of her best. I sure miss those Betty Grable days - and nights.,1381363200,2,149,4.0
5616419,5,B00BGGIXBU,This film gave Betty Grable the best opportunity to show her acting talent and a leading man that was a much better singer than most of her others.  The film had a good story and costumes were relevant rather than an excuse to show off Betty's legs.,1380672000,4,249,4.297872340425532
5616420,3,B00BGGIXBU,"I'm so incredibly happy that Fox has finally seen the light and has recognized the fact that there is a market for these films. Yes, they probably won't sell to the masses at Wal-mart but there are those of us who A) don't shop there and B) enjoy certain stars in just about any film they're in.

I understand at the time this film was released, the critics and audiences were disappointed that Betty Grable was in a long skirt (no famous gams to be seen) and didn't dance. There are no production numbers, either. Her leading man, Dick Haymes, was a crooner, not a dancer and the storyline doesn't really leave room for any dancing.

The story revolves around the women's suffrage movement in the 1870s. When Betty takes a job as a typist in an office, Boston is set on it's ear at the thought of a women doing a man's job. Consequently, Betty charms everyone and proves that she is very capable in all she does in the office, proving that women can work outside of the home.

The songs by the Gershwins are not as famous as most of their other material. ""As if I Didn't Have Enough on my Mind"" is the stand out.

As with all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series - this is strictly bare bones: no chapters, no trailers, no commentaries, no inserts - just the movie.",1378944000,6,1275,4.322175732217573
5616421,5,B00BGGIXBU,Betty Grable and Dick Haymes are delightful in this movie about women's sufferage!  Featuring the wonderful singing of Dick Haymes and a little bit of dancing!,1377993600,4,159,5.115384615384615
5616422,5,B00BGGIXBU,Very funnyand quite enjoyable.  Silly premise and fun diversion from everyday life and a slip into the past.  Betty Grable.,1375488000,2,123,5.1
5616423,5,B00BGGIXBU,"An atypical Betty Grable movie that allows her star to shine brightly, proving she was a far better actress than she gave herslef credit for.

Fox darkened her hair and sent her legs into hiding, apart from a couple of brief flashes of ankle, resulting in an excellent performance from her as Boston's first female typewriter (typist), who becomes a women's suffrage leader and convinces the man she loves that women are equal, too.

A lively supporting cast, including Anne Revere, Gene Lockhart and Allyn Joslyn, assists Grable in making this one fun to watch.",1362787200,14,562,4.905263157894737

8568090,5,B00BGGIXBU,"I  love Betty Grable.  What a talented, beautiful woman.  This is a rare period piece for Betty, set in the 1800's.  The songs are romantic and lovely, and Dick Haymes,  makes the perfect love interest for her.  He has  unfortunately gotten lost in the shuffle of time,  but listen to this man sing.  He was Sinatra's rival until his drinking problem got in the way.  He has an absolutely beautiful voice.",1524441600,,405,4.577464788732394
8568091,4,B00BGGIXBU,"the film and actors were adorable....however, the quality of the film which was listed as NEW was very poor and overall dark ...the lighting was poor...and therefore I returned it since I was charged 19.95 amazon price when the price for a new one was $15.15///and still the quality not good....",1440892800,,295,4.803921568627451
8568092,5,B00BGGIXBU,Of course it came in before the due date which was awesome and the quality for such an old film was Great!!,1425340800,,107,3.909090909090909

8568096,1,B00BGGIXBU,I did not have a chance to rate this dvd as it would not play on my dvd player.  I am very sad about this fact and feel greatly let down by Amazon and its suppliers.,1407369600,,165,3.5833333333333335
8568097,5,B00BGGIXBU,"ONE OF GRABLE'S BEST. COLOR WAS BRIGHT. WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN AND TODAY'S GLASS CIELING AND 77 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR, THIS FILM IS TIMELESS. GREAT SUPPORTING CAST AND NUANCED SITUATIONS AND DIALOGUE. DICK HAYMES AND GRABLE MAKE SURPRISINGLY GOOD CHEMSTRY (AS THEY DID IN ""DIAMOND HORSESHOE"", THE BLOND GRABLE (THO' SOMEWHAT DARKENED FROM HER USUAL PLATINUM) WITH A BLOND LEADING MAN,  A  NICE DEPARTURE FROM JOHN PAYNE, DON AMECHE, OR VICTOR MATURE, HER USUAL DARK-HAIRED LEADS. YOU'LL BE WARMED BY IT.",1404259200,3,501,5.024096385542169
8568098,5,B00BGGIXBU,"Betty Grable is incomparable as a female suffragette, a modern-working woman who challenges the placid facades of Boston society when she falls in love with her wealthy, elitist employer.  Love the way Betty does not flinch from confrontation with his snobbish family or his own caveman beliefs.  Beautiful story. Now if they would just release Mother Wore Tights.  Come on Fox get Betty's best (my favorite and her personal favorite on DVD too)!",1391904000,5,446,5.082191780821918
