8437787,3,B004PT8SMY,"At first, I really liked this KDrama, but by the 9th episode, the intense melodramatic theme started to wear, on my nerves.  It is definitely a very dated 16 episode drama.  In this KDrama, a female is only meant to smile, to cry alot, barely be independent, and to mostly stand there, hopefully looking pretty, with her head bowed, as much as possible.  Be prepared to hear the family endearment, ""Ooppa"" (Brother) at least 1000 times.  Also, the goal, in this drama, seems to center around the principal characters, making each other feel as guilty as possible, within an overly conservative family environment.  So, the viewer will also hear alot of ""I am sorry."" far too many times, to count.  Most viewers will come to this KDrama, to see Song Hye Kyo's performance, but, in the end, it was Won Bin's performance that truly stood out.  I watched this KDrama, through the channel DramaFever, where I used an Internet streaming device, on my HDTV.  I signed up for that channel, for a small monthly fee.",1507507200,,1006,4.708571428571428

8437789,4,B004PT8SMY,"Yoon Joon-suh and Yoon Eun-suh are very close siblings in a loving family. But Eun-suh's family and another's worlds are turned upside down when a car accident reveals that Eun-suh's blood type is different from the rest of the family. Turns out, Eun-suh and her rival classmate, Choi Shin-Ae, were switched at birth. The parents make the painful decision of switching them back to their respective households. Shin-Ae moving into a wealthy family and Eun-suh moving into poverty. The parents and siblings of each family's personalities are quite the opposite too. Shortly after the switch, the Yoons decide to live abroad, leaving Eun-suh behind in Korea.

Many years later, as adults, the once brother and sister are reunited along with their families. But this time, Joon-suh and Eun-suh are falling in love with each other. The forbidden love between these two crosses so many lines that neither family or friends are willing to accept it. But just as these two and their loved ones are desperately trying to work out their problems, something horrible and unexpected happens. Eun-suh is dying from cancer and only has a short time to live. What will happen now?

Autumn in My Heart is the first installment of the Endless Love series. This series is based on the seasons. The other three Endless Love dramas are: Winter Sonata, Spring Waltz, and Summer Scent. None of these four dramas stories are related, other than in mood and feeling. Each tell a different story with different characters.

This was an entertaining and interesting story line that pulled me right into the drama. Two once siblings falling in love with each other touches a unique and conflicting topic. I just had to keep watching to find out what happens next. It's extremely sad though. I cried through the entire drama and I'm not much of a crier. It's a very emotionally exhausting drama. I didn't watch the other installments of the Endless Love series right after, just because I need an emotional break and have the need to watch something happier and funny. The way Autumn in My Heart ends is sad, but heartfelt, shocking, and unexpected in some ways. It was very well done. If your interested in these kinds of dramas, I highly recommend watching it. But you might need a Kleenex box beside you at all times.

(16 episodes) (Many talented popular actors star in this drama, like Song Seung Hun, Song Hye Gyo, Won Bin, and Han Chae Young.)",1388275200,3,2423,4.831325301204819
8437790,1,B004PT8SMY,"The English translations on this DVD are really bad. Many times the tenses are not correct or the meaning is totally incoherent. If you are expecting the Hulu version of this movie, you will really be disappointed. It's a great movie and I love the actors but the Chinese do not do a very good job in translating Korean movies.

The seller did a good job with delivery but that's the only positive I can say about this movie.",1387065600,2,425,4.379746835443038
