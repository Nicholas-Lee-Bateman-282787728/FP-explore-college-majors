3457267,4,B001APZMKC,"I watched this movie expecting a silly and insensitive story, making gay people the butt of all the jokes.  Pleasantly surprised.  It showed some real sensitivity and compassion toward gay people, coming out to friends, and being aware of our similarities more than differences.  Maybe someone will watch it and have their mind opened even just the tiniest bit.",1262822400,7,361,5.084745762711864
3457268,3,B001APZMKC,"A fair-to-middling low-budget comedy, ""Freshman Orientation"" has some good-natured fun lampooning the stereotypes and cliches of college life.  Kewpie-faced Clay Adams is an undergrad frat pledge who pretends to be gay in order to snag the girl of his dreams.  Just how this paradoxical turn-of-events comes about need not be reiterated here.  Suffice it to say that it involves fraternity and sorority initiation pranks that wind up at cross purposes with one another.

Suffering from its own case of identity confusion, director Ryan Shiraki's screenplay reinforces stereotypes even as it's working hard to beat those stereotypes down.  Gays, in particular, may find themselves evenly divided between encouragement and dismay over how they are portrayed in this film.

Still, there are enough moments of loopy charm to make the film worth seeing on a slow, rainy afternoon, and Sam Huntington and Kaitlin Doubleday have appeal and charisma to spare as Clay and his girl.  And, as an added bonus, they are joined by John Goodman and Rachel Dratch in minor supporting roles.",1257033600,2,1074,5.245614035087719
3457269,3,B001APZMKC,"During ""Freshman Orientation"" (2004), incoming freshman Clay Adams (Sam Huntington) spots freshman co-ed Amanda (Kaitlin Doubleday), a perky blonde former prom queen, who is clearly out of his league. Amanda later notices Clay, but - due to a fraternity pledge prank -  assumes that he is gay, and Clay plays along, thinking it is his only chance to date let Amanda get to know him.  He is unaware that Amanda isn't really interested in him, but is playing along with a sorority dare to string along a gay boy as a boyfriend, until breaking up with him at the first sorority party of the season.  Of course, Amanda falls in love with Clay almost as much as he is with her, resulting in a rather predictable comedy of errors.

In essence, this is a typical college student sex comedy, with a definite gay bent (hence the subtle play on words in the title ""Orientation"".  Hey, it beats the heck out of its original title, which was ""Home of Phobia""!).  Besides ""fake gay"" Clay, there are several other gay characters, including a flamboyant bar owner, played by John Goodman (""Roseanne"") who offers the non-stylish Clay a ""makeover.""  There are scemes at the college GLBT student group meetings, a night out for Clay and Amanda at a gay dance club, a roving campus slut (played by SNL's Rachel Dratch), a queer ""poetry slam"" night with a surprise star, a campus protest to the supposed gay-bashing of Clay, and the ""coming out"" of someone close to Clay.

Some reviews have compared it to ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"", and it would be a masterpiece based on that criteria.  But the truth is that this film also relies a bit too much (although not as much as C&L) on tired old stereotypes about gays and lesbians.  More than that, it suffers from the typical college sex comedy malady of lacking any real focus or direction, for the most part, and seems longer than it really is.  Rated R for sexual content, female frontal nudity, and some drug use. On DVD, and occasionally on rotation on Here! TV On-Demand. DVD has no real extras.  I'll give it three stars out of five.",1219276800,17,2076,4.596205962059621
3457270,4,B001APZMKC,"So this is a movie which has not been treated well by a number of people.  But this is more due to expectations beyond what should be expected of a teen comedy.  First of all if anyone thinks this movie makes fun of gay people then sorry it doesn't.  If you think that gay/straight relations do not get all screwed up then sorry but get out more.  The basic premise is not all that different from one which has been played out in real life in one form or another including by a friend of mine back in the early 70's when he would accompany me to gay bars pretending to be my kind of boyfriend and pick up on the fruit flies at the bar.  The difference here is this is a much more sympathetic depiction of the characters and the situation twisted a bit to play on common activities which do play out on college campuses.  It is somewhat over the top in the depictions of different characters but then that is the point of the humor - making fun of the stereotypes by exaggerating them. Clay {Sam Huntington] starts out as the typical prick wanna be swordsman stud on campus and by the end of the movie you want him to be you best friend.  Well kind of.  He and  Amanda [Kaitlin Doubleday] both play out so much of the angst anyone can encounter when leaving hime and headin off to school away from home.  And they do it in a funny fashion.

The main characters are all sympathetic and John Goodman plays a great gay bar tender.  In fact he and Clay's second roommate are my favorite characters in the movie.  Goodman because I have known bartenders like him and they are hard to find these days.  Matt [Mike Erwin] because he is that kid who is finally figuring out who he is and what he wants to be.  I have run into that guy far too often in my life.

Yes this movie runs at a fast pace and does not engage in any amount of in depth development of the characters but it is a teen comedy not a serious drama running deep.  Yes the ending is a bit obvious but then again it is that type of movie - a teen comedy.  Sam and Amanda hook up and Matt steps out on his own.  That in itself makes this a fun movie to watch because the gay guys are not the butts of jokes and left in lonely sadness at the end.

This is not an Academy Award sort of movie but it is fun and it is something that leave a gay or a straight person cringing at the end.  You can laugh at the jokes and not feel discomforted by doing so.",1447891200,,2405,4.063694267515924

3457300,1,B001APZMKC,"I've had an amazon account for about 5ish years now, I rarely write reviews - but I had to for this. This was probably one of the worse films ever I have ever seen. It managed to insult nearly every cultural group. From homophobia, (yes lets portray that every gay guy wants to hook up with you if you are male). To assuming every frat boy wants to take advantage of you. Even Jews and Muslims managed to get a quick one pulled a few times.

I can think of three positives in this movie that makes the one star almost acceptable. One, the blonde in this movie was SMOKING. The bartender at the end of the movie had some really redeeming lines to help counteract all the negatives. Also this move came out in like 2003. It's been 10 years from now so I really hope that we are more culturally accepting.",1368835200,2,802,4.241830065359477

3457309,5,B001APZMKC,"I love this movie. When I first watched it, I expected a stupid raunchy teenage comedy at about the quality level of the 6th sequel to American Pie (or whatever they're at now). What I got instead was a rather sweet movie with some hilarious moments and a tender heart that put it up above many other movies in the raunchy teen comedy flick genre.

I would place this more as a romantic comedy, with Clay (Sam Huntington, who is adorable) and Amanda (Kaitlin Doubleday) in a cute, awkward relationship.

Basically, Clay pretends to be gay to win Amanda over. He is taught the ways of the gays by John Goodman (who is fabulous as an old queen in a gay bar), and shenanigans ensue. Some of it is typical of teenage comedies, and some of the jokes do use some tired stereotypes, but this movie has a good heart.

Highly implausible is the stupid plot of a sorority in which each pledge must seduce a loser (read: different or diverse person) and then dump them, but it really gets at the heart of the movie's message of acceptance, tolerance, individulaity, and being true to oneself.

I don't know how to explain, but this movie is much sweeter than it thinks it is, its main character a boy next door who learns how to be in touch with himself and a girlfriend who learns how to do what's best for her. Through its relatively simple (maybe unbelievable) plot, it manages to explore questions of identity, morality, and social justice, without being preachy.

If you're looking for American Pie or Not Another Teen Movie, this isn't quite the same. However, if you're looking for a movie with a heart, enjoy.",1330905600,,1606,4.5432525951557095
8278565,5,B001APZMKC,I saw the movie once on television. I had actually bought it originally through Amazons moving streaming service. It kept getting lost which forced me to rebuy it. I got tired of doing that and decided to just outright buy it. Glad I did. The DVD had no scratches and was in good condition. Pretty pleased with this. Wish I could have had it as a digital copy. I'm dealing with it though.,1521504000,,388,4.328767123287672
8278566,3,B001APZMKC,"Freshman orientation is one of my fave LBGT films. The actor Sam Huntington is actually from the same area that I am from. Like 10 miles away. Anyways I would get this film a higher rating, except the quality of the one that is on Amazon has a little bit of a lag to the video it has nothing to do with the film itself. I do like the movie a lot. I think it's funny, I think they get amount of chokes in by making one of itself, i.e. the gay community. Which, if you can't take a joke, then you know. You are a sore loser in my opinion. My motto is if you can't laugh at yourself or make fun of yourself a. I will. Lol. It is worth the 5 dollars. John Goodman is hysterical and it honestly, the reason why I even purchased the movie to be honest. To see John Goodman as some big old queen made me laugh cause he doesn't so well. And it's a good movie it makes me think of when I was a teenager, which am not anymore, and I'm not even in my 20s anymore. So I highly recommend that his keep in mind, its only standard quality, and it's a little laggy but not to the point of annoyance, but he'll understand why it's 5 dollars and not any higher. If they get a better quality, trust me, I'd be buying it.",1520121600,,1201,3.906122448979592

Adam pretending to be gay is the main humor of the film. The film had a number of humorous moments and overall I enjoyed it in spite of none of the characters being real or done particularly well,  other than John Goodman playing a gay bar tender.

A similar film is ""Chicks Dig Gay Guys"" although it is not one I recommend.
