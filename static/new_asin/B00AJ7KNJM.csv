5439948,5,B00AJ7KNJM,"Hot Hula is better than Zumba!  Simple, easy to follow but will have you sweating from the warm to the cool down!",1379289600,3,113,4.136363636363637
5439949,4,B00AJ7KNJM,"I love anything Anna Rita does & this is a great workout but I found the set very depressing, it looked like a padded room from an asylum, unfortunately someone did not give this much thought & the production quality was very low..the set looked like someones garage & it didn't look clean so I found it distracting..

a hula workout should be done in a lovely outside area maybe near the ocean or in a park. I had a hard time with the scenery but the workout itself if solid.

The tall, very thin girl who came out in the end was pretty scary. Supposedly she is a model but very skinny I thought..",1379030400,6,598,4.191304347826087
5439950,3,B00AJ7KNJM,The movements were demonstrated well. A lot of energy from the instructor. Could not hear the music that was being used in the video. Each move was separate so did not get to view a routine of how movements would flow together for a dance.,1377475200,3,239,4.333333333333333
5439951,4,B00AJ7KNJM,"Love it!  As I have since figured out, this is Tahitian style dance and I really like it.  I hope I look like her someday!",1371945600,2,122,3.84
5439952,2,B00AJ7KNJM,"Camera angles made it impossible to follow the dance moves. it was mostly aimed at her face or something. She didn't really go over some of the cool down moves either. you could have turned off the video after the 'main work out' or just danced around at the end. I've gone to probably 3 hot hula classes and unless you are familiar with the moves, you're going to have a harder time following. It does give you a sweat and like i said, if you're familiar with it, its ok, if not, i wouldn't waste my money.  It wasn't a very professional work out video. At the end, the producer or someone comes out and just starts dancing with them.",1368576000,9,635,4.24793388429752

5439955,5,B00AJ7KNJM,"My order arrived almost immediately and in amazing condition! I tried it out and I absolutely loved it!

8552479,5,B00AJ7KNJM,Great workout video.,1423612800,,20,6.0
8552480,3,B00AJ7KNJM,"Pros:  The video teaches 4 basic Tahitian dance steps: tamau (side-to-side hip swing), ami (circular hip movement), afata (box), and varu (figure 8).  Although not authentic, which this video isn't meant to be, it's a fairly good work out.  The movements are easy to follow and you will burn calories.  I also like the instructor's fun personality.

Cons:  The audio isn't very good.  I had to turn it way up during the intro and then turn it down once the warm-up started because the music started blaring.  The background music also seems to over power the instructor, especially during the warm-up session.  The segments with the drums is a little better.  The studio background looks like the video was made in an old dirty garage.  Also two of the women in the video are not in the best shape, which isn't very inspiring.
Although the movements are easy to follow, it can get boring after a while.  It would be great if she incorporated choreography for each segment for a complete dance at the end.  Lastly I think the video is over-priced considering the somewhat poor quality.  I also bought the Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout video on Amazon and I like it much better and it was only $5.",1421452800,9,1199,4.647619047619048
