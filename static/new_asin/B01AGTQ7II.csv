8747341,2,B01AGTQ7II,"The instructor seems to have good skills, but I was disappointed by the production quality. My impression was that the footage was a cobbled-together collection of film clip taken over time in a variety of settings: classes, clinics, indoors, outdoors, etc. Seemed light on step-by-step, how-to explanation.",1478736000,2,307,5.553191489361702
8747342,5,B01AGTQ7II,"I'm just starting out with the jo. After looking around for good at-home instruction, I've found nothing better than Essential Jo (both this DVD and the book by the same name, which is excellent). The explanations and advice are so helpful, and the DVD makes the moves come alive in ways that wonderfully complement the book. Highly recommended.",1458604800,6,345,4.9655172413793105
