8728099,5,B013KM41QS,"I bought this from amazon in France, and had it resent by someone in EU.  They won't direct sell it to the US, and the alternative to getting the magnificent 3D Blu-ray version is paying exhorbitant prices to a US reseller. Regarding the inability to play the 3D dvd so many reviewers have complained about, thats their fault. They didn't understand region encoding. While a number of DVD players will play multi region dvd discs, this does not mean theyll play multi region Blu-ray Discs, and especially not multi region 3D Blu-ray. Completely different deal. So next time, pay attention, read the machine and disc specs carefully, and please don't blame your mistakes on the hardware or the software. In 3D Blu-ray its one beautiful film, and alas, one that was never released in that format within the US.",1531353600,,808,4.81294964028777
8728100,5,B013KM41QS,"5 stars for a great story & movie (because I've seen it on Netflix, but want the discs in French for my classroom), but this combo pack will not play in North American (Region 1) players, despite the description that it will play in all regions.  Do not purchase if you do not have a multi-region player or international player.  So disappointed.  Fix the description of this product, Amazon...",1525737600,,394,4.681159420289855
8728101,1,B013KM41QS,"I bought this dvd last year, as it's a lovely children's story.  I went to view it today, and got a ""This player is incompatible with the region marking of this disk"" message, in spite of the fact that the product was marked as playable in ""all regions.""  It's sold as a combo blueray + DVD, but neither works in my blueray player or in a standard dvd player.  Very disappointed!",1525046400,,379,4.309859154929577
8728102,1,B013KM41QS,"I LOVE this Movie/Story . . . but this particular version would not play in my BlueRay . . . it has an international setting so won't play on an American machine.  (Hmmmm  I wonder why they are selling it on American Amazon?)  They gave me a refund no problem, but I haven't been able to find a version I can enjoy yet.",1489104000,,319,4.031746031746032
8728103,5,B013KM41QS,"I was really disappointed that the Netflix release of this movie didn't include an optional French track, so I went ahead and ordered this Blu-ray/DVD combo. My player (very old LG BH200) can easily be made region-free for DVDs, and can have the region changed at will for Blu-ray, so the foreign region (2 for DVD, B for Blu-ray) of these discs didn't bother me at all. But if you don't have that luxury with your player, then this disc set will essentially be a very light paperweight. Also, your TV needs to be able to display a PAL signal. Most modern TVs in North America can display PAL without issues.

The movie itself is absolutely fantastic. My 2.5yo daughter is in love with it, we've watched it together numerous times and it still brings tears to my eyes. Being able to watch it in either French or English is fantastic and it's fun to listen to my daughter make commentary in whatever language we happen to be watching it.",1475193600,,936,4.5058823529411764

8728105,5,B013KM41QS,"I am a French teacher (In the United States) and bought this film as a fun treat to show at the end of the school year (I also selfishly wanted to see it!). The combo pack allowed me to find the best fit to play in the classroom. Obviously, I played the DVD in the native French but added English subtitles for my students. Most of them did not know the story beforehand and, at first, were not excited to see it. Once we got about halfway through the movie they were hooked and really enjoyed the overall story. In my opinion, it is a great modern adaptation of the classic story. However, it is most beneficial to read the original story first before watching the film. My students read the first few chapters of the novel before watching the movie. It really helped them to understand the story when watching the film.",1470009600,15,821,4.372549019607843
8728106,3,B013KM41QS,"I bought this because it is an excellent movie. However, only the DVD worked and the Blu Ray cannot be played because of incompatible region. I never have a problem with Blu Rays from Amazon because the US zone is similar to mine, If I order a Blu Ray from Amazon UK, I have to make sure the Blu Ray is region-free. I paid a lot for this as I had it shipped at the fastest rate. Now I am wondering what to do.",1463011200,9,409,3.880952380952381

8728108,1,B013KM41QS,"I haven't been able to play the dvd at all. I have a dvd that's zone 1 , 2 , 3 but for some reason it doesn't recognize this cd. I have plenty of movies from Europe since we go every year. I was so excited when I got it cuz my son loves the movie. Then nothing ../",1461283200,10,264,3.4915254237288136
