8065900,4,B0009S4IRE,"TV Guide DVD box sets have very strong audio output and above average picture quality. These packs do tend to be bulky however, with three discs taking up the same shelf space that another manufacturer's 100 movie collections use. Perhaps an overly critical comment to anyone with plenty of room for a video library.

The three TV westerns here were geared for a younger audience and certainly are the best-known programs of their kind. The half dozen Lone Ranger episodes include that series' first three chapters-- all are from the 1949 premiere season.

Roy Rogers' show ran from 1952 to '57 and was sponsored by POST cereals and JELLO pudding. Each offering was a nice mix of action, comedy and music-- always highly entertaining. Former ""Little Rascal"" Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer was a regular cast member.

Finally, we have a block of six Cisco Kid half-hours that originally aired sequentially early in its first season. Only episode #1 (""Boomerang"") is missing. Cisco and sidekick Pancho roamed the west looking for folks to help. In the process, they got into and out of all sorts of scrapes.
