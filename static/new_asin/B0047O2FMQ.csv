8418255,5,B0047O2FMQ,"This video did exactly what I was hoping it would do.  It gave me a number of large balloon ideas that are practical for pool work and occassional restaurant/line work.  The difficulty of the balloons is around that of Don Caldwell's rubber duckie from Volume 3 of Mad Hatz and Wearables.  In other words, not too hard for somebody with experience, but challenging nonetheless because 646/660's are not the easiest of balloons to twist.  Stretch does provide some suggestions to working with larger balloons and a few techniques that are unique to working with balloons this big---working with 646/660's isn't just a matter of making everything bigger, but might need additional support.  The video is a good primer on a technique and I've used what I've learned here to make other floaties that Stretch doesn't cover here.

The only complaint that I had with the video is that there are some scenes where he is working with a black balloon while wearing a black shirt, or light balloons with a white background---in these cases the texture of the balloons are lost because they blur in with the shirt/background.",1310083200,,1113,4.8936170212765955
