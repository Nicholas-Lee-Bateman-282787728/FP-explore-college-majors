3175565,2,B0017UOU58,"I am a beginner and was in the process of trying to find a slightly more advanced yoga workout that would make me sweat.  I though ""cardio"" yoga would be perfect. By no means am I superfit but I was yawning all the way through the hour workout.  Not only did I find it unchallenging, Moreno's constant encouragement was distracting and incredibly annoying.  I don't need to be endlessly reminded to be ""grateful"" of my abilities.  And I didn't even break a sweat.  I will say the express workout was much more challenging and just direct instruction.  Why the hour-long workout was so fundamentally different than the express is beyond me.",1247616000,,639,4.711711711711712
3175566,5,B0017UOU58,"I was interested in yoga, though I had never seriously tried it before, and I received this DVD as a gift. I decided to try it out and I loved it! I didn't find the instructions particularly hard to follow, and if I was confused I took a second to look up and reposition myself. After the first time through each workout I didn't have a problem following the instructions.

I love having the option of a 30 minute workout or a 50 minute workout, and both are relaxing and challenging at the same time. Overall, I have found this DVD to be a great daily workout for my mind and body, and I'd recommend it to anyone!",1234051200,8,614,4.203389830508475
3175567,3,B0017UOU58,"I LOVE this workout!  i started with it on exercise tv on demand and i've already decided to buy it when it is no longer available there.  when i started out i could barely get through it but now i find it challenging and refreshing.  the music is good, the background is beautiful, and the instructor's voice is relaxing to listen to. my thighs and buns already show more definition.  i just wish it was a little longer but sometimes i rewind it and go through the entire routine an extra time.

Update: I was given this DVD off my wishlist and had to change my review to 3 stars instead of 4 because the full workout is very slow and not cardio by anyone's definition (or dance).  the workout I had done before was the express workout which I still really like doing.  And the bonus yoga stretch is pretty good.  But I honestly don't think I will do the full workout again because I didn't care for it.  And in the full workout she does have some strange phrases that she repeats a lot. I thought it would be the same as the express workout just longer but it is completely different.",1228176000,,1086,4.284313725490196

3175569,5,B0017UOU58,"I love this more active yoga that is a nice change of pace from some traditional yoga, if you are looking to switch things up a bit, like I was!

3175573,4,B0017UOU58,I do this workout on a regular basis. Usually twice a week. It is great for all ages and easy to follow. I have noticed new areas of strength in my body and love that this is a practice: meaning that one may always improve. So if you don't get there on the first try with balance or poses keep at it. Even the people in the video are wobbly sometimes!,1351555200,2,351,3.9577464788732395
3175574,3,B0017UOU58,"I actually purchased this dvd because I found the express workout on my Warner Cable ""On Demand"" health channel.  I enjoyed that the express workout was 32 minutes.  Though Patricia Moreno makes a mistake w left and right foot forward, once you do it regularly, you will get with the program and correct her error.

I found the music overshadows her voice and is higher volume.  I work out at 4:30am and found I had to raise the volume too high so, after several workouts, I can now lower the volume and not have to worry about the neighbors complaining.

I do enjoy the workout but her ""smile"" comments and too much talking when I hanging on for dear life doing the side hold is a distraction. haha  I do laugh and am proud that I can actually do it despite telling her to shut up in my head!!!

I paid, but a few dollars and found it well worth the purchase.",1350950400,2,860,4.271604938271605
3175575,2,B0017UOU58,"On at least two occasions Patricia calls for the wrong leg to be moved which is incredibly annoying, especially because she is so into the ""flow"" of the movements.  If you are not watching the screen (which you will not be doing if you are in downward facing dog), you have to stop the routine and readjust.  Also, the right and left sides of the legs are not worked out evenly.  I do not love the music and really prefer the Rodney Yee ""15 Minute Results Yoga"" with which the ""Cardio Burn yoga was packaged.  It is easier to follow and far more relaxing.
For amusement, watch the interview with Patricia and try to keep track of the number of times she mentions her mentor, John Friend.  I know people love this guy, but her rapture at every mention of his name veers uncomfortably close to that of a cult member for my taste.",1335916800,,827,4.3441558441558445
3175576,4,B0017UOU58,I really like the change ups in her dvd. could not be any more smooth and gentle. I like the 1st 8 minutes of movement to get you ready and energized. My favorite yoga right now!,1334188800,,178,3.9722222222222223
3175577,4,B0017UOU58,"This video has been my first experience with yoga and I have been pleasantly surprised! I did the express workout  five or six times before even attempting the longer one and I was surprised how much slower and almost boring the longer one was. The repetition of the child's pose feels good as a stretch but as far as a cardiovascular workout, it is definitely lacking. However, the express workout is great and the flow from one pose to another is challenging and requires a lot of core strength and practice. I try to do the 30 min. workout 5 times per week and when I am finished I feel great every time! I find Patricia to be very inspiring, positive and calming. She is great at what she does and I hope to someday make flow yoga look as graceful as she does! Great 30 min. workout. Ok 60 min workout.  Good starter dvd, nice music, and beautiful California backdrop! I will continue to use it!",1325548800,,899,4.377245508982036
3175578,3,B0017UOU58,"The 30 minute workout is an excellent calorie burner. The series is a little repetitive (lots of lunges), but that makes it easy to follow, and it isn't so bad that it gets boring. A couple of places are uneven on the two sides: Once she tells you to put the right foot back instead of the left, and another area where she does high lunge on one side and not the other. I also don't love the balance series, mostly because she tells you to put your foot on your knee during tree, and I've always heard that your foot should either be just above or just below your knee, never on it. I do like her voice, the ""beat"" to the workout, and the fact that it really gets me sweating and even breathing a little heavy. I haven't made it through the longer workout because I get bored after about 15 or 20 minutes. It isn't as intense, and the moves seem more dance-based than yoga, which some people may like, but didn't work for me.",1312588800,7,925,4.173184357541899
3175579,2,B0017UOU58,"I loved the way this was filmed, the music, the actors/yogis, the instructor, but the actual sequencing was just way too repetitive.  For the 50 minutes you devote to the DVD so much more could have been done in terms of different kinds of poses.  I eventually just kept the DVD playing because I liked the sound of it and did my own yoga poses.  It's pretty much just a flow in and out of childs poses to downward dog with a couple of standing poses thrown in.  The intro section did feel good however, as it had a nice dance like stretch to it.  Overall, I don't recommend it to anyone other than serious beginners who want the same repetition throughout.",1303516800,,657,4.352459016393443
3175580,4,B0017UOU58,As other reviewers have mentioned the longer workout is pretty slow and not much of a cardio workout at all. I did it once and that was it. I was much more impressed though with the express workout which is 30 minutes. It gets my heart pumping and moves faster than the longer workout. I definitely feel a difference in my body when I am finished.,1294531200,2,347,4.2727272727272725
3175581,2,B0017UOU58,"Maybe it's cardio for people who have never worked out.
The main work out was very slow, and Patricia's cheesy sayings were really starting to make me gag.  I even had to turn the sound off.  I will probably NEVER do this one again.
Now, there is a bonus express workout that actually was not too bad.  Still was not close to a tough yoga workout, but MUCH improved and she kept her silly phrases to a minimum.  The bonus stretch was okay.  I can do these 2 bonus features infrequently.
Due to her EXTREME cheesiness and turtle-moving-rate for the main workout, I will NEVER buy any products with Patricia Moreno.",1292716800,2,613,4.486486486486487
3175582,1,B0017UOU58,"If you look for a cardio exercise, this is NOT it. If you have ANY experience at all with yoga exercise, you'll be bored to death by very slow, prolonged explanation. Big disappointment.",1284508800,,186,4.666666666666667
3175583,4,B0017UOU58,"I should start with noting that I've only ever done the 30 minute express workout on this DVD, so my review only references that portion.  The 30 minutes is perfect for me to do in the morning before I leave for work, and I like to alternate it with Gaiam's Pilates for Weight Loss DVD.  I do work up a sweat while doing this routine, but cardio is probably an inaccurate descriptor.  It just moves a lot faster than your average yoga routine.  I've done yoga at the beginner-intermediate level off and on for a few years, so I didn't have much trouble following Moreno's instructions, and after a few tries I have the routine mostly memorized.  I probably wouldn't recommend this DVD for beginners though, since she does go very fast and have some moderately advanced moves in there.  There are a few rough spots where the instructor tells you to move the wrong leg, and she does stumble on her words sometime, which I really wish they would have worked on in editing.  Also, the instructor constantly tells you to smile, which I hatehatehate and mostly makes me want to break my TV.  I guess some people might like the chipperness, but it grates on my nerves.  Overall though, I feel really great after doing this workout and it's an excellent start to my day.",1279843200,5,1262,4.524229074889868
3175584,5,B0017UOU58,I love that this workout not only makes you sweat but reminds us to stay open and walk tall. Always lead with an open heart,1278115200,3,123,3.96
3175585,3,B0017UOU58,"This yoga practice is as far from cardio as you can possibly get, so I think the title of this DVD is misleading. The yoga practice actually moves very slowly through each pose and I enjoyed the practice very much. The instructor is very good and positive but she was too chatty for my taste. Some people may not be bothered by that because she is a very likeable person.",1266364800,4,371,4.314285714285714
3175586,4,B0017UOU58,"After a few years on hiatus, I am finally coming back to yoga for fitness.  We (my husband and I) recently joined the local gym with yoga classes and I've been doing that again.  However, some days I am not able to work out until later in the evening so I've been looking for a yoga practice that is a bit of a break from the typical sun salutation.

Honestly, I thought this was a GREAT workout for my level right now.  (I did the longer 50 minute session... haven't yet tried the 30 minute session).  She kept the flow slow, almost TOO slow at times but it was for great purpose because it became more challenging toward the end.  I was actually dying for it to be even longer!!  That's really my only complaint from the 50-minute workout... I wanted a few more times through the sequence.

If you are quite advanced in your practice or do not enjoy a slow-paced flow with lunges and balancing, I would not recommend this.  For beginners and those who are maybe ""mid-level"" in their practice, this is a good sweat and a great flow.",1259884800,,1033,4.338541666666667
3175587,5,B0017UOU58,"I really enjoy this DVD. I am just getting back into Yoga after a year hiatus. This DVD is a great start. It's pretty basic, but challenging. It's a beginner yoga sequence, but would be difficult if you are brand new to yoga. I like the music and the intructor's voice. Sometimes her instruction is hard to follow if you are not glancing up every now and then. I enjoy doing the longer 50 minute workout and often wish she went through the whole sequence more than once after you build up to it. I don't get a good sweat out of this workout, but I do feel it the next day. So, I know it's working! I will keep this in my regular rotation of yoga practice!",1254614400,,655,4.125
3175588,3,B0017UOU58,"This workout is challenging and partially fun because you are asked to do more advanced moves that don't require a lot of yoga background. From this, you will be able to burn fat and slim your body. The problem is with the instructor, she is not very good at giving instructions. More than once, she had said ""right"" instead of ""left"" because she was supposed to mirror for us. Sometimes she is too slow and sometimes too fast. I didn't like how she was trying to do everything in 30 minutes.",1252281600,,492,4.417582417582418

3410082,3,B0017UOU58,"This yoga practice is as far from cardio as you can possibly get, so I think the title of this DVD is misleading. The yoga practice actually moves very slowly through each pose and I enjoyed the practice very much. The instructor is very good and positive but she was too chatty for my taste. Some people may not be bothered by that because she is a very likeable person.",1266364800,4,371,4.314285714285714
3410083,4,B0017UOU58,"After a few years on hiatus, I am finally coming back to yoga for fitness.  We (my husband and I) recently joined the local gym with yoga classes and I've been doing that again.  However, some days I am not able to work out until later in the evening so I've been looking for a yoga practice that is a bit of a break from the typical sun salutation.

Honestly, I thought this was a GREAT workout for my level right now.  (I did the longer 50 minute session... haven't yet tried the 30 minute session).  She kept the flow slow, almost TOO slow at times but it was for great purpose because it became more challenging toward the end.  I was actually dying for it to be even longer!!  That's really my only complaint from the 50-minute workout... I wanted a few more times through the sequence.

If you are quite advanced in your practice or do not enjoy a slow-paced flow with lunges and balancing, I would not recommend this.  For beginners and those who are maybe ""mid-level"" in their practice, this is a good sweat and a great flow.",1259884800,,1033,4.338541666666667
3410084,5,B0017UOU58,"I really enjoy this DVD. I am just getting back into Yoga after a year hiatus. This DVD is a great start. It's pretty basic, but challenging. It's a beginner yoga sequence, but would be difficult if you are brand new to yoga. I like the music and the intructor's voice. Sometimes her instruction is hard to follow if you are not glancing up every now and then. I enjoy doing the longer 50 minute workout and often wish she went through the whole sequence more than once after you build up to it. I don't get a good sweat out of this workout, but I do feel it the next day. So, I know it's working! I will keep this in my regular rotation of yoga practice!",1254614400,,655,4.125
3410085,3,B0017UOU58,"This workout is challenging and partially fun because you are asked to do more advanced moves that don't require a lot of yoga background. From this, you will be able to burn fat and slim your body. The problem is with the instructor, she is not very good at giving instructions. More than once, she had said ""right"" instead of ""left"" because she was supposed to mirror for us. Sometimes she is too slow and sometimes too fast. I didn't like how she was trying to do everything in 30 minutes.",1252281600,,492,4.417582417582418
