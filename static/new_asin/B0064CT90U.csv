4948973,5,B0064CT90U,"This was the last season to be shot in black and white. The next two seasons would be in colour.
This is a very good western series with plenty of action and guest stars like Ernest Borgnine,Robert Vaughn,James Coburn,Charles Bronson and Dan Duryea. Both lead actors John Smith and Robert Fuller are excellent in this. This series tells the tale of two friends that run a stage stop where coaches of people would arrive on their way to their destination. Various characters came through so there was a varied collection of stories to be told. Hoagy Carmichael who had appeared in the first season had left the series and Robert Crawford who played the brother to John Smith on the show would only be seen infrequently and would be written out by the end of the season.
This is a good solid western and deserves all the praise it gets.
Timeless Media Group have already released the color seasons. So this is the last season to be released and we now have all four seasons to enjoy.",1332720000,25,981,4.548022598870056
4948974,5,B0064CT90U,"Of course the second season was b/w but more violent for a family show at the time. It actually opened up a new direction for Robert Fuller to venture into and showcase his talent (he once stated he wished he had been born a cowboy coming out of New York State(!)) as a physical actor. The same talent would be seen in the color 90 minute season of Wagon Train when he portrayed Cooper Smith, a similar mode to Jess Harper. No, I have not purchased this set as yet, but have copies from a collector off-air syndication, not excellent quality but tolerable. Once you watch this action-packed season, the first color season loses quality but it shows an improvement over the premiere year. You also notice two different opening segments and two different music themes, yet it is pure unadultered Laramie.",1332547200,3,802,4.654929577464789
4948975,5,B0064CT90U,"I love all the seasons of Laramie, but this season is the best of them all. Why? Easy. They dumped the old piano player (or he left), and Robert Crawford was dropped soon after, centering the drama on action and more action. Now, that's the kind of western I like. Jess and Slim take on all kinds of bad guys, from Robert Vaughn and Rod Cameron to Ben Johnson and Jack Elam. There's a great biography of John Smith (interviews with Robert Fuller)....and even an episode from the first season that got overlooked (a good one, too). I'm extremely happy with this one. (And for the reviewer who expected the season to be in color, season 2 was never filmed in color).",1330560000,20,664,4.450819672131147
4948976,3,B0064CT90U,"As a kid growing up in Geelong, Victoria (Australia) our tv reception during the 1960's was poor for some channels.  One of those poor channels broadcast Laramie.  I was frustrated in attempting to discern what was going on a very fuzzy tv screen.  So now well into my middle age I can finally watch, in great digital remastered format, those Laramie episodes I missed out on way back in my youth.

Whether it is watching Wagon Train or Rawhide or Laramie I believe that compared to modern television the story telling was fresh and less predictable other than the fact the stars of the series would come through each adventure victorius.  These old westerns remind of my introduction to the world of drama.  I can't seem to get enough.",1330560000,24,736,4.666666666666667

There are 6 volumes with 3 episodes on each volume. The quality of each is exceptional.  They also contain the opening music and such. So far, only 18 episodes are available.

The episodes playing on TV are  good but wish I had listened to those who wrote of the poor quality. The last 2 seasons are in color but they are washed out and colors are not true, for example Jess's green hat.

4949025,1,B0064CT90U,"During the 50's and 60's, westerns were the king of the airwaves. From ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Cisco Kid"" to the more sophisticated fare of ""Bat Masterson"", ""Have Gun - Will Travel"", and ""The Rebel"", I have slowly tried to catch up on all of them I can, as I wasn't born until many of them had left the air. Of all the TV westerns I've watched, ""Laramie"" rates as one of the poorest. With corny writing, unlikeable characters and bad acting, it's hard to find any redeemable qualities to ""Laramie"". Robert Fuller chews up the scenery and John Smith has the acting talent of the junior high footlighters. The scripts are unbelievably predictable. And, even if they were played by better actors, the characters of Jess and ""Slim"" (what a creative name) are about as unlikable as they come. I found myself rooting for the bad guys in most episodes.

It is truly amazing that this show was able to attract such a plethora of former and future stars. I can't help but think it hurt their careers more than it helped them.

Given the quality of the series, I wish I could at least say that Timeless Media Group's issue of the shows on DVD was first class. Alas, it is typical TMG quality. Transferred using inferior sources (one episode on this Season 2 set comes from a well-worn video tape and is so poor, I had to skip the episode), the presentation is riddled with grain, dirt, scratches, and every other possibly defect. Only a few public domain DVD's that I have seen come close to the poor quality video presented here.

If you are a fan of good old TV westerns, I suggest you stick to them.....and leave this show, and this set, on the store shelf.",1473552000,,1653,4.466887417218543

However, when I purchased from Amazon Prime the picture quality is poor as if Timeless Media Group recorded from a VCR then distributed. Paying $35 to $45 is a rip off and each of the seasons should have sold for at the most $10. TMG and NBC Universal should be a shamed for letting this quality of video to be distributed.  Amazon should pull the videos and stop taking people's hard earned money.  The folks who say the video's are in good quality must either work for Amazon or must be blind.

4949036,4,B0064CT90U,"Some of the reviews I've read complain of poor quality but I did not find this to be the overall case.  There was only one or maybe two episodes that I considered poor quality; one skipped over the part where Jess picks up money and handed it over to a man he has just saved from a beating which is important and referred to later in the program.  The quality of most of the episodes is comparable to the ones on GRIT TV.  I particularly like the second season of Laramie because it stars mostly Jess and Slim with a couple of episodes featuring Andy who, in my opinion, should have remained a part of the show instead of being replaced in season three by Mike.  Laramie was a good, solid western that should have lasted more than 4 seasons.  The DVD arrived timely and in good condition.

4949046,4,B0064CT90U,"I was a great fan of this series when it first aired in the 60s. I was very pleased to be able to view it again on DVD but in order to do so you must have an all regions DVD player.
There have been some comments about the quality of the production but it should be remembered that it is 55 years old and personally I think TMG and NBC have done a wonderful job in remastering it. It was a great success in its time and it is a real pity that the show only went to 4 seasons as there was probably more in it. Nevertheless,we are fortunate to be able to look at it again now. It is full of classic western stuff with plenty of gunfighting, saloon bar brawls and the most incredible horsemanship. But, there are other elements in it that sets it apart from all other Westerns of that time : the little domestic cameos are a joy in themselves but what really makes it is the chemistry between John Smith's character of Slim Sherman , the serious ranch and relay station owner and Robert Fuller's Jess Harper the drifter who appeared at the ranch in the first series and stayed on first as employee and later as partner in the business. They clearly got on really well with each other outside the programme and this comes across in the series making it a joy to watch the way they sparked off each other. For me, personally, Series 2 also contains some of the best story lines of the series.",1456876800,6,1386,4.194756554307116

4949066,2,B0064CT90U,"I have been watching this series on GRIT TV (over the air broadcast) and it is presented in much higher quality than with this DVD set.
It looks like it was recorded from old unrestored prints or worse. I was expecting the quality that I've seen on TV recently which is very crisp, clear and looks like a full restoration in HD.
Maybe you get what you pay for in this case. I paid $17.71. The other seasons cost $34 and up. I don't know if I dare try the others.
The other reviews were obviously written with nothing to compare with. Maybe they made special copies for broadcast purposes, but somehow that just doesn't seem right.
One more thing that bugs me is that the sound sucks. I have to turn the volume way over normal levels to be able to hear it compared to everything else.
My advice would be to just get a good antenna and copy it from GRIT TV with a DVR.",1441152000,8,866,4.191616766467066

4949069,1,B0064CT90U,"This review is purely for the video quality of this set. The show itself was a solid show with 2 solid starring characters, fine story lines, and excellent guests, some of them legendary. The show itself ranks around 3 to 4 stars out of 5. This review, however, is for the embarrasing video quality of this set, probably ranking 5 stars out of 10, a grade of F. In this age of Bluray, who would want to play this set, the terrible video quality hurts the eyes to watch. I am a collector of thousands of tv shows, and I would say that this is the worst retail issue I have ever seen. If you can buy this set cheaply buy it, it is worth having to have a look at this classic show, but I am sorry to say, you will only view it once because of the terrible quality.",1437782400,7,761,4.046357615894039

4949082,5,B0064CT90U,"I just purchased all four seasons of Laramie and have wanted them for 4 years now. I had previously downloaded them from YouTube and the quality from YouTube was horrible.  I was worried when I read the reviews about the bad video and audio quality and after suffering through extremely terrible videos of Laramie for 4 years, I was thrilled when I put the DVD in my Playstation and pressed play, I could actually see Robert Fullers face clearly.  The video quality was 100 times better. Yes, there is some minor quality issues but that often occurs with all the old shows I have received.  People who except 1080dpi quality from an old show will be disappointed.  Those of us who know better will be thrilled with what we have gotten. I have collected shows such as Trackdown & Johnny Ringo, which were never put on VHS or DVD so you accept any quality of video you can get.  You just want to preserve the history and the sheer joy of the show. Once these show does become available on DVD,  I purchase it. My love for westerns and the appreciation for the work it takes to restore them, means that we should realize we will never get perfection.  I will agree that they could box the DVD's better. Both my Season 2 and my Season 3 were loose and easily fall out of its holders. I also purchased ""The Deputy"", ""The Tall Man"", and""The Restless Gun"" at the same time and they all came in good packages and in excellent condition.",1414713600,2,1428,4.427480916030534

The disc are suppose to be secured in the plastic cases by being snapped on via the hole in the middle of the disc.but the cases are so cheap and flimsy they won't stay in place.

4949099,3,B0064CT90U,"The show itself is very nice family western.  The first season was well rounded and had interesting characters, especially Hoagie Carmichael.  Just loved him as Jonesy.  Now why was his character and that of Andy played by Robert Crawford Jr. removed from the show? Haven't found any reason for this anywhere in their bios or fan archives.  It really leaves the 2nd season feeling less than it was in the 1st.  This being said, the stories were just OK. many feature just Slim or Jess and so the family aspect has been lost.
  The production quality of the DVD's is awful. In many of the dark night scenes, it is impossible to see anything, the film is grainy and sound quality uneven. It is a very old show so it is possible that no better quality originals exist but with todays technology, I thought they could have been remastered in some way.
  As in the first season set, this set also is packed with very poor quality DVD cases.  Every one of the DVD's were floating in their cover with the little center tabs broken.  It is very difficult to put them away and keep them scratch free with them unsecured in the package.  Very Frustrating.  I would hope that the amount of money spent on them could at least give us a quality DVD case.",1391731200,7,1241,4.438053097345133

4949102,4,B0064CT90U,"I grew up during the height of the TV western.  I watched and loved almost every western on TV but, for some reason, I never watched Laramie.  (Part of the reason might have been that for a year or two, Laramie was on the same time as Combat, a series I watched religiously.)
Anyway, even though I had no specific memories of this series, I thought I would give it a try.  And I'm glad I did because it was a well-produced and excellent western.  Like so many series of that period, it featured many great guest stars (most not mentioned on the back of the box.)  One episode featured the great Ernest Borgnine, then still a major movie star.  Another episode featured Charles Bronson (and an unbilled Richard Kiel.)  James Coburn appeared in an excellent  Christmasy episode as the series leads, John Smith and Robert Fuller, Coburn and several others are trapped in a farmhouse surrounded by a small army of villains waiting to kill them.  An excellent episode, along with many others I've watched. (Since this series was filmed at Universal, Alfred Hitchcock's "" Psycho"" house also makes an appearance in two episodes.)
Like most sets released by Timeless, the quality varies.  Most of the episodes are okay, but I did run across one that was completely unwatchable.  Also in the set is a very nice retrospective on the life (and sad death) of series lead, John Smith.  This is very well done.
In conclusion, I'm happy I picked up this set.  I'm only surprised that I did not run into this series a lot sooner.  Oh well, better late than never.",1382227200,10,1547,4.598540145985401

I would suggest you start with season one though so you have a good grasp of what this series is all about. But if you do come in at season 2 you will not be disappointed or confused. As with season one, season two is in black and white. And again, the story lines are strong enough that you will soon forget that you are watching a TV show without colour. In season 2, the actors are comfortable with their characters and you can sense a strong chemistry between Smith and Fuller in their roles as Slim Sherman and Jess Harper. We lose two of the supporting cast in this season, both Hoagy Carmichael and Robert Crawford Jr leave the series at the end of season one with the exception of a couple of guest appearences made by Crawford in this season. We get plenty of action, a strong sense of the deep friendship that has developed between Jess and Slim and how they have each other's backs. So we have drama, action, some humour and a feel for the good ol' days when a man's word was something you could depend on.",1361664000,6,1093,4.23444976076555

4949118,5,B0064CT90U,Laramie is a classic western which begin in 1959. Laramie second season is every bit as good as the first. A black and white western drama centering around a weigh station for a stage coach line while running a small ranch Slim Sherman with his friend Jess Harper lead us in adventure and capture our hearts and minds. This is the last year to be filmed in Black and White as the third year is in living color on NBC. Known as the Laramie Peacock instead of the NBC Peacock sometimes is because of the year they were both introduced. Check out my review for Laramie I wrote at HubPages. [...],1359504000,,592,4.342342342342342
4949119,5,B0064CT90U,"The second season of this beloved Western finds ranch owner and relay-station operator Slim Sherman (John Smith) and his ranchhand and friend, ex-drifter and fast gun Jess Harper (Robert Fuller), batching it as Slim's younger brother Andy (Robert Crawford, Jr., who does make a few return appearances and is often referred to in the dialogue) departs for school in St. Louis with cook/factotum Jonesy along to ""ride herd on him.""  (Hoagy Carmichael's contract had expired, and for reasons unclear the producers didn't try to renegotiate it, but basically wrote him and Andy out of the series.)  Their relationship is easier now, though sometimes strained by the unexpected chores added to those connected with range work and stagecoaches, and while Jess's temper is still of the short-and-explosive variety, he seems less inclined to take off either because of some old obligation or because of something unpleasant from his past catching up with him; his less-than-stellar past doesn't intrude on his new life as often in this season as in the last, despite the fact that at one point he's kidnapped all the way to Utah to lead the way to a hidden cache of stolen coin, and in another segment is arrested by a Colorado lawman of unsavory reputation for a murder he didn't commit (Slim gets himself deputized and rides along to make sure Jess doesn't come down with a case of lead in the back--although Jess can't understand why Slim won't gang up on the man with him).  Another time he's used as bait to force Slim's hand; Slim stands to be shot if he responds to the ultimatum, but he knows he'll at least have a chance to defend himself, where Jess will be hanged if he doesn't go--and Jess never doubts his friend will come for him.  Meanwhile, Slim proves again his devotion to ""what's right"" as he copes with the prejudices of his neighbors when he tries to get a cattleman put on trial for murder in connection with the death of an Indian working for the Sherman Ranch.  Along the way we also learn something of Slim's family (an Uncle Jack who was ""a terrible liar,"" a long-standing feud with another family).

A regular ""stock company"" of guest stars has begun to develop, with such names as Ernest Borgnine, Dan Duryea, Jocelyn Brando, Edgar Buchanan, John Anderson, L. Q. Jones, Rod Cameron, William Bryant, Ben Johnson (the last four twice), and James Anderson (three times) all returning from First Season, and others (Robert J. Wilkie, Denver Pyle, Lee Van Cleef, R. G. Armstrong, Harry Lauter, Roy Barcroft, and Gregory Walcott) making repeat appearances (the last three times, the others twice).  John McIntire and Denny/Scott Miller, both of whom Robert Fuller was later to work with in ""Wagon Train,"" also appear, as do Steve McNally (the bad brother in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winchester-73/dp/B0088WL9R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winchester '73</a>, Claude Akins, Harold J.

Besides having lost, with Andy and Jonesy, some of its family-friendly flavor, this particular season is marred not only by the usual historical inaccuracies of its era (Laramie as a town having existed for 20 years or more) but by assorted continuity flaws (in one segment the Sherman ranchhouse has an attic, in the next a ladder leading to a trapdoor in the roof; the local sheriff is sometimes Mort Corey, sometimes someone else, and played by the same actor only twice until Stuart Randall finally takes over the role permanently about midway through) and at least one major improbability (a Christmas-Eve attack on the ranch by Sioux Indians, who not only come in numbers much larger than they really need to--at one point there are at least 50 of them on the ridge--but keep trying even after losing at least 10 of their fellows, something Indians would never do unless there was someone at the focus of their attack that they had vowed to kill come hell or high water), besides the minor one of Andy visiting home several times in the fall but not at all for Christmas.  But it's still a tightly-written, action-filled Western populated by interesting characters--both the regulars and the people who move in and out of their lives.",1359417600,2,4878,5.4332892998679

Another amazing thing - the first two seasons in black and white are better/clearer on DVD then the last two seasons in color.  So if you care more about the visual and less about the wonderful actors and story lines - just buy the black and white versions.,1356912000,2,379,4.463768115942029

4949124,5,B0064CT90U,"I fell in love with this series as a child and spent most of my adult life trying to remember some of the episodes - it was great to be able to get a hard copy at last, the few I had managed to record more recently were on VHS and I now have no way of playing them.  So much for progress!",1355875200,,288,3.5714285714285716
4949125,5,B0064CT90U,"I bought Laramie, the Second Season, because I had loved this series when it was on in my youth.  I bought the first season wondering if I would still enjoy it as much and was delighted to find that I did.  The humor and interaction of the cast is just as enjoyable as I remembered.  I think the second season is as enjoyable as the first and even though I miss the characters of ""Andy"" and ""Jonesie"" the show still works.
One of the things I notice watching this show as an adult is the attention to detail that went into the sets.  I work in the history field and while the 1860s-1870s west is not my field( so I can't attest to the authenticity of the set) I was intrigued to see how much of the settings really conveyed the environment of Wyoming 150 years ago.  I highly recommend this western.",1355097600,3,799,4.230263157894737
4949126,5,B0064CT90U,"We recieved our copy of Laramie the complete first season, we have watched and enjoyed each episode so much so we have now received the 2nd and 3rd seasons and at present we are working our way through these, we enjoy both the actors and the story line of each episode. As I have said in the past it is so good to watch good family shows, not like the absolute rubbish now showing on TV. Thanks again to Amazon and Timeless Media Group",1347753600,,435,4.190476190476191
4949127,4,B0064CT90U,"Laramie is one of my favorite westerns and I enjoyed these episodes.  They could have been a little better quality, but I think the  imperfections make them more realistic.  The one thing that annoyed me greatly and the reason for 4 stars for this product is that only 1 of the disks stays attached to its box.  The others slide around inside their box and fall out when the boxes are opened.  I can't find any excuse for that.

I give the show itself 5+ stars.",1338595200,10,461,4.3023255813953485

That's almost okay, because the first and second seasons of Laramie are far better than the last two seasons.",1527984000,,262,4.26
8492448,5,B0064CT90U,"The disc case doesn't hold the discs securely.  Other than that, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I love everything about the Laramie series:  the characters, the story, the music...  The quality of the product is pretty good, after all it was filmed in the early days of TV.  It is so fantastic to see the old westerns again!",1526860800,,332,4.466666666666667

8492450,2,B0064CT90U,"Sorry to say there is nothing I like the most.  The quality is horrible. It looks as though it was made with a cell phone recording a TV program.
I watch Laramie on my local TV station and the quality is ten times better.  So disappointed.",1524787200,,239,4.173913043478261
