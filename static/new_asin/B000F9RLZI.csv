8119526,5,B000F9RLZI,"I rented this from Netflix out of curiosity, and now I'm buying a copy for a keepsake. I work in the TV industry, and I've suffered through countless poorly-shot, poorly-edited, boring or mundane travelogs and scenic videos, but THIS is SUPERB. EXPERT cinematography, GREAT music and sound, and truly insider-tip and historic curiosities that will enlighten and inform...not to mention a video that you'll want to take notes from to plan your visit to the American west. A great mix of history (including unusual newsreel footage of, for example, President Eisenhower beginning the demolition of Glen Canyon Dam's rockworks via telegraph key) native crafts and lore, and super interviews with park rangers, anthropologists, biologists, and local trading post folks and other ""down home"" experts, this is truly a wonderful video excursion through some of the greatest scenic wonders that make America great.",1158105600,6,906,5.387323943661972
