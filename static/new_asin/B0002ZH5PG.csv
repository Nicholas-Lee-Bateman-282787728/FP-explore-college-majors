8035267,5,B0002ZH5PG,I saw an article about the photographers and was interested in this way of approaching taking a photo.  This DVD was excellent.,1263081600,,127,4.7727272727272725
8035268,5,B0002ZH5PG,"This is a wonderful approach to workshop videos. They both presented their ideas on outdoor photography in a highly intellectual, but approachable manner. Mr. Lanting and Mr. Rowell are two of my heroes in photography and Mr. Rowell will be greatly missed. Highly recommended!",1256083200,2,276,5.295454545454546
8035269,4,B0002ZH5PG,"I have enjoyed Galen Rowell's images and writings for as long as I can remember.  This DVD, done with Franz Lanting, is a treasure of insight into how these two master photographers think.  The fact that it was made before digital photography became the new film is not a detractor what so ever.  If you are looking for f-stops and shutter speed teaching then do not purchase this item.  If, however, you are looking to see how world class photographers think and apply this thinking to their image making, then buy it.  The section on ethics is interesting and demonstrates the depth of their commitment to their profession.  I gave this four stars instead of five because the production iteself is a little rough and not as professional as the subjects.  Subject matter and presentation get five stars but the production drags it down to four.  That is nit picking.  Do not miss the opportunity to see Galen Rowell at work!",1253145600,3,925,4.695652173913044
