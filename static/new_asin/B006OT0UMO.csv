5011219,1,B006OT0UMO,Who ever copied these movies from the original movies did a poor job.  I already had the original movies and they copied them and let a lot of scenes out.  It sounded like I never saw these movies.  they gave a wrong description of the movies.,1351296000,7,243,4.239130434782608
5011220,3,B006OT0UMO,"This new DVD collection just released on March 20th 2012,is a collection of classic Sasquatch films from the 1970's.
This set includes The Legend of Boggy Creek(1972)(listed on the back of the DVD as ""The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek), The Capture of Bigfoot(1979), and The Legend of Bigfoot(1976). Most fans of Sasquatch will be very familiar with these classic drive-in movies. While these are already available either alone or included on other various Bigfoot DVD sets, it's a great place for the new Bigfoot collector to start. However these films do show there age, they appear to be cheap video
transfers and the picture quality leaves something to be desired. I believe Boggy Creek has been released several times with much better video quality. Recommended for only the most rabid of Bigfoot fans! Get the popcorn ready, it's gonna be a long night!",1332374400,10,858,4.965277777777778
8502315,4,B006OT0UMO,"These movies are all low budget, bad acting, bad special effects and bad photography and yet very funny because of all of this (though not intended). I enjoyed them even though all of these movies included a bunch of nobodies and a dude in a gorilla suit.  You might want to drink while watching them.  The last thing I will add it the last story was basically a soft porn (70's variety) so a lot of nudity and that was unexpected, which helped keep me interested.

Since I was five years old I have loved the idea of Bigfoot existing and so things like this movie take me back to my innocent days of my childhood and due to this I will continue to buy movies like this regardless of how bad they are.",1517356800,,701,4.2164179104477615
