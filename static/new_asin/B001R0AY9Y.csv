I too am a fan of John Wayne, memories of my father and me time was of watching John Wayne, have to laugh cuz I even canceled dates just to have these presious moments with my father.

3771717,3,B001R0AY9Y,I searched diligently so that I would have medium grade movies. Many of these are black and white and poor sound quality and picture quality. Several made in the early 1040s. Stories are good but quality is bad. I was disappointed.,1264982400,33,231,4.658536585365853

3771730,3,B001R0AY9Y,"Simple movies, simple plots, good guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after....Well that's westerns in the 1930's and 40's. These are very low budget films with lots of repeated scenes from one movie to the next and the same actors as good guys in one film and bad guys in the next. But they are fun to watch if a little goofy and predictible. Good thing John Wayne is the star!",1417737600,4,387,4.243243243243243

3771735,4,B001R0AY9Y,"I am a John Wayne Fan as was my father so any movies of his I am going to like.  That said, I would advise anyone purchasing this item to understand that in a collection of this type, (1) the movies will NOT have been remastered'  (2) they will retain the grainy appearance of the original celluloid;. (2)  the 'letterbox' style has been accomplished by making the picture MUCH smaller further compromising its appearance; and (3) most are in black and white which may be a disappointment for some of the younger viewers.  That said, these are some of his first staring movies, some of the oldest still in existence which is why I bought the set.  I am happy with my choices for the very reasons I have listed above.  It is a piece of Americana that few will ever get to see any more and his co-stars in many of these are legend.  It is a good set at a good price.",1413504000,6,864,4.2317073170731705

3771739,2,B001R0AY9Y,Mis pick. At least it was cheap. Save your money from this collection. Spend a bit more on something better produced.  Digital transfer poor. No subtitles. Watches like an old late night movie on a small black and white TV. Heaven help if you have a big screen set.,1411171200,,265,4.408163265306122

3771741,5,B001R0AY9Y,I love anything John Wayne. I was lucky enough to have met him as a child & as big as he was on screen he was even bigger in person. This collection is a great choice of movies that keep you entertained for quite a while. It's just too bad that The Duke is no longer with us.,1410048000,2,275,3.7586206896551726

3771757,5,B001R0AY9Y,"What can I say about John Wayne.  He was my favorite Cowboy from the time I was little in the 40's.  He may have made a few NOT SO GOOD movies in his early years, but I don't think there was anyone that could surpass him in his later years.  His movie collections are the best and very intertaining.  Well worth watching if you like Cowboy movies as much as I do.  Its too bad the cowboy era has passed.",1344902400,12,403,3.9875
