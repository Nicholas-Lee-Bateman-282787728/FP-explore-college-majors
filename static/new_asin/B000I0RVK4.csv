2650760,3,B000I0RVK4,"""Shaadi Se Pehle"" was slated by the critics. I however feel that it has worked as a wacky comedy, there were some scenes which made me howl with laughter. Akshaye Khanna flits through his comedy scenes but does not suit the serious side of his role. Ayesha Takia, the firebrand newcomer, is perfect in her role. She is especially good in her last song. Aftab Shivdeasani and Sunil Shetty give sterling performances, and for once are not wasted in a film. The story may be stilted but it does allow for some hilarious scenes. Mallika Sherawat begins well and then levels off to being average. Overall the film was average enjoyable comedy, that will win no awards, but watch it for some laughs!",1304640000,2,693,4.642276422764228
2650761,2,B000I0RVK4,"For the movie as a whole I give this movie ZERO stars! None of the performances (except one) were noteworthy.

The only highlight was Suniel Shetty's performance as the menacing yet lovable mafia don (my 2 stars go to him exclusively; he really deserves 5 stars though but I unfortunately have to consider the movie as a whole when rating it). Not only did he look stylish and sexy with his longer hair and shades, but he carried off the part with such wit and charm! Really refreshing! (I bookmark and watch just his scenes and forget the rest). I feel really bad that his performance couldn't have been part of a 'hit' movie and was instead wasted on this 'flop'.",1178668800,,665,4.4958677685950414

8143036,1,B000I0RVK4,"All the humor was based on the premise of this guy wanting his girl to hate him so she wouldn't be sad when he dies of cancer. (Don't worry, that was not a spoiler for THIS one) I wanted the premise to be funny, but after a while it only was a set up for silliness and confusion that wasn't really that funny.
It was too silly and non-sensical for my taste.",1418083200,,357,3.9722222222222223

8143042,2,B000I0RVK4,Sorry - waste of time. The movie seems like a drag. Requires a lot of patience to sit thru it. I switched it off after 20 minutes into the movie,1370995200,,144,3.8333333333333335
