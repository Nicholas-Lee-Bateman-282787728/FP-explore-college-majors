8643485,1,B00IMQZFSQ,This is by far the WORST movie I've ever seen!!!! Five stars? I would not give it one star! It had to be made by high school kids. Don't spend any money on this. I should have quit watching it after the first 10 minutes!,1446163200,3,220,3.911111111111111
8643486,5,B00IMQZFSQ,"The Arrival is a perfect replica of 1950's Sci-Fi.  Ufo's invade a small town, a lizard creature roams the streets, spinning newspaper headlines talk of UFO sightings.  In one scene, involving two young woman at a diner, there is a terrific take off of the classic Twilight Zone episode ""Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up"".  As a big fan of 1950's Sci-Fi movies, this was a pleasant surprise.",1412812800,4,396,4.7101449275362315
