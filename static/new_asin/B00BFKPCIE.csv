8567793,5,B00BFKPCIE,"The first film I ever saw when I lived in the DF and I have no idea how I managed to follow as much of it as I did. No subtitles, and if there were subtitles, I'm afraid there would be a stream of obscenities. This is a series of vignettes about life in the DF in the 1970s, from top  to bottom, and it is brutal as only a Mexican view of life in Mexico can be. You have to recall that population there was growing at around 3 percent a year, so an emphasis on paternal irresponsibility and the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control may seem a bit heavy handed. On the other hand, listening to the valedictory will bring tears to the eyes of some viewers, because it's hard to conclude that much has changed in 40 years other than fashion, jargon, and the dramatis personae. A true classic of the Mexican cinema and a valuable historical document as well. It's hard to find, so if you get the chance, buy it.",1507507200,,916,4.204545454545454
