4076044,5,B0036EH3ZW,"I am sooooo glad that even though Jim Henson is gone, his spirit lives on!  This is such a good program for the 4-7 range (the kids go to preschool and have playdates) but also do real science experiments and learn real-life applications for science.  There's the element of silly (the kids get together on the playground for Good Laughternoon), but great program to watch even as adults.  Working on building up our Sid The Science Kid movie collection...",1358208000,,456,4.746835443037975

8389891,3,B0036EH3ZW,My child is too young (toddler) to really appreciate this dvd. I bought it because I have an N Circle dvd that came with a Pocoyo dvd as a bonus and it featured an episode of each show from the N Circle collection (which included a cool musical style Sid the Science Kid episode that my child enjoys so much). However this dvd isn't as entertaining to my child right now. So I'll save it for later years.,1480377600,,404,4.1923076923076925

As a teacher, I am happy to know they are learning while they are laughing; however, I must say I don't LOVE this show.  Sometimes, I struggle with the children not using their manners when speaking with adults in the show, but that's not a deal-breaker as I know I can instill that myself.",1475366400,,439,4.395061728395062
