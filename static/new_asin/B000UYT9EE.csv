8215697,1,B000UYT9EE,"I purchased this for my daughter as she loves anything Motley Crue, we anxiously awaited this DVD, and ended up fast forwarding through the whole thing, it was all so boring, and a total waste of money and time!!!

We expected interviews and such, and this was just poor footage in the recording studio with John Corabi, and one of Vince's weddings, along with terrible footage of when Motley Crue received their star on the walk of fame...Please don't waste money, if you want this, I'll send it to you for postage....HA HA",1197158400,11,524,4.634408602150538
8215698,1,B000UYT9EE,"This low-quality DVD features all footage post-1993, primarily during the Corabi year(s), and nothing from the band's 1981-1991 decade of decadence.

What you get is a few grainy shots of the band laying around in the studio, a weak video of Vince taking his wedding vows in 2000 and an amatuer video of the band accepting their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Save your money. Trust me.",1196899200,9,392,4.666666666666667
8215699,2,B000UYT9EE,"I  only gave this DVD 2 stars because it is pretty boring. It shows some black and white footage of them in the recording studio when they were without Vince in the band. It also shows Vince's wedding, which is alot of Nikki and Vince just standing there waiting for Vince's bride to walk down the Isle. If you want a cool Motley DVD, get the live one, Carnival of Souls. It is far better than this bore-fest.",1196208000,12,409,4.243589743589744
