8258192,4,B0015FGCLK,"Frank Sinatra's involvement with OCEAN'S ELEVEN began when a Las Vegas gas station attendant handed Sinatra his screenplay. Frank's enthusiasm for the story carried over to his buddies and ""Ocean's 11"" became the first of several Rat Pack movies. A solid cast, several cameos, a tight script and breezy ad-lib performances by its principals make this crime heist tale great fun. Seeing Frank, Dean and Sammy in their prime and hearing Davis's vocal on the movie's theme adds to the enjoyment.

SYNOPSIS--
Eleven buddies (led by Danny Ocean, aka Sinatra) plan and pull off a theft at five Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. They get away with their haul, but are later confronted by an ex-gangster who's figured out what occurred and is demanding half the take.

Shirley MacLaine's impromptu appearance as a tipsy gal is a highlight; George Raft (who was a personal friend of Vegas pioneer Bugsy Siegel) portrays a casino owner and Red Skelton appears as himself. Richard Boone is the voice of an unseen minister; TV quiz show announcer George Fenneman can be heard in a phone conversation with an interrogating sheriff. Watch for one-time cowboy star Hoot Gibson in his last screen appearance, as a roadblock deputy.
