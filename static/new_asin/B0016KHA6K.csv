8262914,5,B0016KHA6K,"A really sad film for a young girl who had overconfidence in herself and ended up diseased and broken. In contrast to the usual happy ending, her boyfriend abandoned her  to the shady people she liked to associate herself with. There are girls like her in the real life who end up paying heavy price for the thrills.",1465862400,,316,4.448275862068965

8262918,5,B0016KHA6K,"The set up is a story-within-a-story. In the present day, Vera is a Madrid writer dealing with breast cancer and family issues. To get her mind off her problems, Vera's editor forwards her a love letter written by a photographer killed 70 years earlier during the Spanish Civil War. Her interest piqued by this powerful, poetic and somewhat enigmatic letter, Vera decides to publish a book based on Emilio's work during the 1930's. During the course of her research, Vera becomes absorbed in his photography, letters, and journals. As Vera reads Emilio's journal and the unsent love letter addressed to Lola, she becomes obsessed. She needs to understand everything about the photographer and his muse. So, she is drawn to Argentina where their story began and traces the lovers' path from Buenos Aires to Patagonia. The letter and photographs barely began to tell their story.

Academy Award winner, Luis Puenzo, used every element at his disposal to great effect in telling this story...words, colors, music, location and a brilliant cast of some of the leading actors from Argentina and Spain.

Patagonia is a land of breathtaking landscapes and seascapes; the cinematography does it justice.

Although the movie has nudity and sexual situations, the most sensual scenes are the tangos. The musical score is gorgeous. In fact, based on hearing a bit of the tangos, I bought the soundtrack two years before seeing the film.

DVD special features include optional English subtitles, chapter selection, and filmography listings for the director and principle actors.

It is a sad story, but wonderfully told. Highly recommended.

Spanish with English subtitles.",1238889600,18,1661,5.225563909774436
