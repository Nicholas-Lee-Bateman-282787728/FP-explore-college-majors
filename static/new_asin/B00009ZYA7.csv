7994680,5,B00009ZYA7,"... than director Michael Legge's wood-paneled basement family room! The NO-BUDGET charm of ""Honey Glaze"" goes hilariously hand-in-hand with the comedic genius of its brilliantly funny cast!

To quote director Michael Legge:

""Honey Glaze is a perfect little girl. She minds her Daddy, plays with her toys, and stays out of trouble by never leaving the house. Trouble is, she's over thirty years old. When her father, a government agent, is killed, Honey is pulled into a perilous plot of intrigue and danger. Can Honey, with the help of agent Dash Hope, hope to stop the evil plan of Dr. Sum Thaim and his alluring assistant, Nurse Tarika? Can she grow up real fast? Will she put down her toys and play with the big boys? A fast paced, action comedy that will have you saying, 'it's only a stupid movie, it's only a stupid movie...' "".

If you think James Bond is silly, you'll LOVE ""Honey Glaze"", starring LORNA NOGUEIRA as Honey Glaze, ROBIN GABRIELLI as the intrepid secret agent Dash Hope, MICHAEL LEGGE as the ridiculously-composite-villain-character Dr. Sum Thaim, and CHERRY ZINGER as Dr. Sum Thaim's perpetually blood-stained sidekick, NURSE TARIKA!",1205107200,,1158,4.989637305699482
7994681,4,B00009ZYA7,"But funny.  To me, anyway.  If you like really silly, absurd comedy and like B movies,  then you should enjoy this double feature of low budget madness.  Oscar Wilde this ain't.  More like Soupy Sales,  but I could overlook the cheesiness of it and enjoy it on it's own terms.  Lots of fun.",1097452800,,290,4.3584905660377355
7994682,5,B00009ZYA7,"This film has nearly no Budget but it pulled me in laughing every second. I went to the premier of this film, then bought the DVD shortly after. Good Flick and its worth it for any B-Movie kinda Guy.",1083974400,,199,4.128205128205129
7994683,4,B00009ZYA7,"Honey Glaze pays homage to James Bond movies while venturing into uncharted territory in an altogether hilarious and successful romp.  It's high camp, but there's still enough plot to sink your teeth into, a mystery for you to ponder while watching, and characters you'll love or hate (tip: hate the bad guys, love the good guys). The actors do a terrific job at being believable in their roles, keeping straight faces and staying in character as they get into one bizarre situation after another. It goes beyond ""appreciative chuckle"" to ""burst out laughing"" many times, and is good enough that I let my young teens watch it despite an oh-so-brief nearly-topless scene that's absolutely necessary to the plot. If you have a slightly off-the-wall sense of humor, buy it, watch it, invite your friends over to watch it with you; Honey Glaze is worth sharing with others who appreciate  the somewhat strange and very, very funny.",1069459200,4,927,4.935897435897436
7994684,3,B00009ZYA7,"...But lets say its a female 007 parody(Sorry,Holly Berry).Kind of like ""KILL BILL"" with laughs. Those Ninja villians,silly/bumbling ninjas. Opening credits Were,Very 007 style.""My Fair Lady"" of spy farces. The classic""Pill In The Drink Glass""scene has been replaced here.",1068249600,,272,6.0
