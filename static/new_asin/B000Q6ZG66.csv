It also gives insight to media spin and how that helps fuel the anti Bush, anti war movement. America really needs to hear truth in order to stop all the hate for our decision to show strength against known enemies. Have we forgotten an act of war was declared on us?? See this film!!",1200614400,3,395,4.351351351351352
