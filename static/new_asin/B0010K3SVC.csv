8237924,5,B0010K3SVC,"First let me start by saying that the movie was everything that I expected and then some. Sigourney Weaver's narration in this version( Discovery channel ) is impeccable and far better than the BBC version in my opinion. Now lets get to the reason for my rating the service a 1/2 star. I ordered this from Amazon because in the description area it stated that this was a HD DVD and that it isn't playable in a standard DVD Player, Blu ray Player, or PS3. So I was expecting a HD DVD Disc. Not so!...The disc I received was standard DVD and not what I was expecting, it can be played in the formats mentioned. I wrote the seller and although they were willing to accept my return I declined because then I would be out the shipping costs. I wrote Amazon to explain the situation so they could fix it on their end and still haven't heard back from them. Word to the wise...Be careful when ordering the HD DVD version and ask questions, don't go strictly by Amazon's description on this so called HD DVD version!!",1359590400,,1010,4.377659574468085
