8360854,4,B002B8SJP2,"I found Jari Love's workouts last year and have picked up quite a few of them.  I really enjoy the strength workouts and how they make you feel.  While you are doing the workout, it didn't really feel difficult, but I definitely felt it the next day!  I highly recommend all of Jari's workouts!",1360368000,,294,4.407407407407407
8360855,5,B002B8SJP2,"I really like Jari Love's older workouts. Although I am an advanced exerciser, I'd classify this collection as ""Intermediate"" workouts. The two videos can be amped up with more weight to make it advanced. Alternatively, if you are just starting out, you can use lighter weights to get the job done. I like to throw these into my rotation every one or two weeks.... Very affordable as well!",1310428800,2,389,4.735294117647059
8360856,5,B002B8SJP2,"There are 2 DVD's.  The ripped to the core has 9 compact moves that simultaniously work upper and lower, so that you burn more calories and get a full body workout everytime.  Very effective because you get the ""cardio effect"" and burn a lot of calories during the workout followed by the weight training burn of calories after the workout (2-4-1).  The get ripped dvd is one of her original workouts, where she does not do the combination moves, therefore its not effective (its like majority of the weight lifting workouts on the market that just haven't figured out how to maximize your workout time).  With that in mine its okay, but compared to her other workouts its not as good.",1281312000,,685,4.636363636363637
8360857,4,B002B8SJP2,"Ripped to the core from Jari love is effective and get results. The work out was easy to follow and no gimmicks. The Get Ripped! is not so great, I found it a bit boring.",1280102400,,170,3.8857142857142857
8360858,5,B002B8SJP2,The videos are great!  I am so happy with this purchase and with Amazon's service.  I received my product so fast.  I didn't expect for a while.  Amazon is great and I will always use Amazon for my future purchases.  Thanks!,1258588800,,224,4.365853658536586
