4432803,5,B004MW57BY,A good solid crime show. Real people solving real crimes without all the Hollywood. This is what I`m talking about! Great wriying and great acting!,1353974400,,147,4.92
4432804,5,B004MW57BY,Since Brenda Blethyn is one of my favorite actress imagine my surprise to see her in a Columbo like rain coat solving murders set near the cliffs of northumberlund...her dad has died in episode one and her life in her new home--his--takes on a dizzying aspect of acceptance and discovery...the way she works with her detectives is wonderful...i love everything about her except she needs to stop the drinking :-),1341792000,43,412,4.9

4432806,5,B004MW57BY,"If you like British detective series, this is that tv genre at its best.  The beautiful scenery and haunting music add a lot of atmosphere to the chilling murder mystery plots.  I cannot recommend these highly enough.",1340150400,29,217,4.837837837837838
4432807,2,B004MW57BY,"I really like the character and the scenes.  But, either the film was cut in numerous places, significantly, leaving me to think that the film jumped a segment, or....the filming was not smoothly done.  Several aspects left me wondering why no segues, and wondering how in the world the film got to where it was.  Makes me mad since this is very expensive as episodes go.",1335830400,16,371,4.590909090909091
4432808,5,B004MW57BY,"I discovered this series 2 months ago, and using my Roku have plowed through all 8 seasons, and am completely mesmerized by the stories, acting, and scenery.  The murders are gritty and often downright disturbing.  Brenda Blethyn is marvelous - and subtly reveals more and more of herself.  It is wonderful having a middle-aged to elderly main character - no glamorization, face lifts, etc.  In fact there are some scenes she looks like a bag lady!!  There are several subplots in each story, some are red herrings, but all are interesting.  After finishing the eighth season I felt at loose ends - haven't gotten interested in another series yet.  So went back and watched Season One again, and I had missed so much the first time I watched it!!  I missed all the hints about Vera's relationship with her father, and her unhappy childhood.  I'll be watching all the seasons again, eventually. By the way,  I use subtitles, not  because of the accents, I lived in south eastern England many years and understand most accents, but because of my defective  hearing!  Not all episodes have them, which is too bad.  I highly recommend this series.",1520380800,5,1143,4.794871794871795

4432825,1,B004MW57BY,"we started watching episode 1 & gave up. The accents made it hard to understand what was going on & so we turned on the subtitles, but there seemed to be a jumble of unexplained disjointed scenes without dialogue & again,we just couldn't figure out what was going on. We've never read the books this is based on so perhaps that's necessary to understanding...or perhaps we're just not British enough ~",1507766400,,401,4.661971830985915

Brenda Blethyn as Vera is wonderful, sharp, insightful, tough as old boots but she cares about her job and her people. She WILL solve the case!
And the scenery is gorgeous!
I'm so happy to find there's another season already filmed!!!!",1506211200,5,298,4.75
4432829,3,B004MW57BY,"Good mystery. Well done by the cast. I have to say that if Vera was my boss I'd resign. The screen writers give her a brilliant detective character, but she's a screechy pain in the arse. 5 stars except for that. I'm hoping season 2 moderates that deficiency.",1505692800,3,259,4.416666666666667
4432830,5,B004MW57BY,"The ""Vera"" series is one of the best. Lots of people agree because it's now filming its 8th season!  The character Vera is unusual, but compelling to watch. The relationships between her and her officers is deep, changing and riveting to watch. The crimes are well constructed and difficult to solve. And the MUSIC! If there were a soundtrack CD of ""Vera"" I'd buy it immediately. The music deepens the entire show throughout, and is a character itself. Very highly recommended!!",1505520000,8,478,4.901234567901234
4432831,5,B004MW57BY,"I have watched Vera a few times now, over the past few years.  The acting is great!  Brenda Blethyn is great.  Her partner is great, a nice comparison of the two different generations.  The stories are good and well written and well presented. It is paced differently than American detective shows, but that is how British detective stories are. They focus on character more and that tends to slow the pace a bit.  Actually, I like the slower pace, it allows one to enjoy the process as well as the story.",1505001600,2,505,4.5054945054945055

4432839,5,B004MW57BY,"I'm a huge fan of British police and mystery series.  One of the best shows currently in production is Vera.  Season One of the show is the introduction to the team and to Vera Stanhope.  Vera is the Detective Chief Inspector of the Northumberland and City Police  (a fictional town which is situated near the ocean.)  Vera is played wonderfully by award-winning actress, Brenda Blethyn.

Where many US crime shows glamorize their police force, Vera's team look like everyday folk.  Vera is a middle aged woman who has worked her way up the ranks.  As the show continues, we learn more about Vera and her background.  Her team is made up of a few individuals (a good number of whom do not have speaking parts.)  Notably, in this season, her main assistant is DS Joe Ashworth (played by David Leon.)

Vera has a sharp tongue when she feels that her team isn't giving their best.  Two of her team, DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) and DC Holly Lawson (Wunmi Mosaku) seem to be on the cutting end up of anger on more than one occasion.

Vera has a knack of charming her suspects into providing her information.  She is so down-to-earth, I suspect the individuals even forget she is with the police.  That is, until she sharply pin-points them and then skewers them with potential scenarios of the crime she is investigating.  Scenarios which pit the individual as the wrong-doer.  Whether right or wrong, her reasoning makes sense.  She deftly works her way through the suspects and arrives at the correct answer through hard-work and investigation.

This is one of my favorite shows and I'm happy to purchase the seasons.  Another cost-effective way to watch this show is through the Acorn subscription that is available through Amazon.  For a low monthly fee, you can have access to all sorts of fantastic British shows past and present.",1499644800,8,1836,4.746835443037975
4432840,3,B004MW57BY,"The endless supporting cast changes on this show are maddening...removing the potential this had as an ensemble powerhouse.

4432841,5,B004MW57BY,"I enjoy watching a good crime show. When I first saw VERA and realised that I missed some episodes, I ordered  VERA. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.. VERA  went from good to great although I watched series 6 I will order so that I can view it again.

The interaction within the cast is not easy and doesn't flow well.  The accents are a little difficult to understand and to me it's not worth the effort.

4432864,5,B004MW57BY,The Brit's detective series' are mostly superior to the American ones in my opinion. They are less concerned about the looks of the actors.

4433122,1,B004MW57BY,"I've never written an Amazon review before. Not for it's video anyway. Never felt the need to. However season 1 episode 3 ""The Crow's Trap"" of this show really got to me. An instance there was when the Columbo looking lady says to the sulky (passed over for a black female cop for an assignment) WHITE cop, ""she's young, female, she can play the sister card, you can't"". And he's all content with that explanation. Explains everything I suppose!? And before that when she (black female cop) complained about extra work being assigned to her. Said Vera's response was  "" Well no clubbing for you tonight then "" to which she replied ""I don't even like clubbing"". Her response, sarcastically seeming "" well ain't that a stroke of luck""!!!

 I mean. It's not even a period piece where one could excuse it on those grounds.

In my opinion a very RACIST, stereotypical, low brow, sub par acting, hateful, seemingly unhinged at times protagonist. Her background isn't provided other than the fact that her neglectful hoarder of a father passed. Maybe that explains all. I didn't stick around to find out.

She is a bit ornery, and unconventional; reminds one of Peter Falk and Columbo on US tv. Of course, she is extremely good at her job, while not being the easiest of bosses. Scenery is excellent, and the stories within and behind the mysteries are engaging. Not for the younger kiddies because of the subject matter. Well worth a watch.",1465776000,4,547,4.708333333333333

She's more like a Columbo thanan Inspector Morse, but maybe that's just the shabby raincoat. The mysteries themselves are sometimes frustrating, because people who should be motivated to help the police catch the killer instead lie and refuse to cooperate.

unnecessary violence. just to get a rating. Vera's character could be any woman  and she has an ongoing life . I especially like that all the

This middle-aged, gruff, police detective with saggy clothes who dislikes children is not lovable at first sight, but she grows on you. The chemistry between her and her partner is interesting. Joe is a family man with a loving wife and several children; Vera is a life-long single who lives alone in the old stone house she was raised in by her widowed father (with whom she had a difficult relationship). But as the series goes on, we see that Joe has some second thoughts about his domestic situation, while Vera has been known to take an abandoned child under her wing and fight like a mother bear to protect him. My husband commented that Vera is a female Columbo. Good comparison. I would recommend this highly to fans of Inspectors Morse and Lewis, Wallander, Pie in the Sky, New Tricks, and other BBC detective stories.",1462406400,4,883,4.630573248407643

Brenda Blethyn is hilariously annoying, who could remain angry with her? There's something appealing about her bluster and the hurts under the surface. Of course, I would hate to have her as a boss, but I love the nasty quips to her hapless minions on the police force as they scramble to do her bidding. Only their dedication to solving crime and their secret admiration for the way she seems to always ""crack the case"" could keep them working with her.

David Leon is the young detective who works under her, a thinly disguised son-figure, who, though sometimes completely exasperated with her, holds a certain tenderness also.  Which she generally disdains.  It is only in later episodes that you see that it is mutual, as they dance their dance of irritation and caring for one another as they solve some truly baffling crimes.

I find that even well into season 3, and accustomed to British drama, I must still use Closed Caption, or I miss important dialogue. That is how thick the accents are, and vernacular difficult for this Yank to understand.  But it would never stop me from watching!",1461715200,6,1298,4.549356223175966

4433193,5,B004MW57BY,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series one she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's life, as she relays bits and pieces to her new DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. DC Holly Lawson is played by Wunmi Mosaku, who is feeling bullied by Vera. Jon Morrison plays long time DC Kenny Lockhart, and Paul Ritter plays Billy Cartwright, the pathologist.a

Series one as usual, provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 3 there are four 90 minute episodes, The Ghost Position, Silent Voices, Sandman Years, and A Certain Samaritan. I am such a fan of Brends Blythyn and Vera, and I look forward to each episode.

While all mysteries do have that formula that begins with the commited crime and all of the drama during the investigation that ultimately leads up to the revelation of what really happened (every episode has Brenda suddenly stop in her tracks and get this look of SURPRISE on her face when she has her epiphany), one never tires of Vera and her view of the world and those around her.

The stories are rock solid, and don't become absurd like 'Lewis and 'Endeavour' and it's beautiful to look at. No artificially desaturated colour here. Vera herself is the real thing. A lovable, funny, complex character. It's an excellent show and there's not a dud story in this series.",1441929600,,425,4.835616438356165
4433219,5,B004MW57BY,"What an incredibly interesting character this Vera is. In this first series you won't find out what motivates her . There are only hints as to what makes her the way she is. Perhaps later seasons will give more insight into how and why she relates to the world around her as she does. Love all the quirks and  mannerisms this character is infused with. Reminds me of an English Columbo type character with her overcoat and out loud thinking approach to crime solving. While her character is a bit rough around the edges she has a way of interacting with victims and criiminals that is unique Never saw that in any other crime solving character before. The only negative is the use of colloquial expressions or Engish terms for objects that I, as an American, don't understand.  Will watch series again and have pencil and paper to write them down and hopefully find out what they mean online. There aren't enough of them to be disruptive to the storyline, however.",1441411200,4,964,4.631578947368421

4433242,5,B004MW57BY,"Vera is a work of police-procedural art and an example of how drama should be done. Vera, Brenda Blethyn, is a middle-aged chief detective with a deceased taxidermy dad, heart trouble and a logical mind like Sherlock Holmes.

Everything about her and the characters in the show is real, flawed and engaging. She is terse, unemotional at times, but a true lady in every sense of the word.

The episodes are excellent. I can't think of one that wasn't. My guess is that this show was just too good to last. Truly, a work of art for hard boiled, police-procedural junkies. I only wish it had lasted 10 seasons.

4433323,3,B004MW57BY,"I determined to watch all four episodes in the hope that it would all get better. The last episode on here - Lazarus was much better than all the rest. I don't much care for north of England accents and am somewhat amused by other viewers inability to understand what they say. Dialogue was typical Tyneside and I had no trouble understanding them even though I am from the southwest of England.
Vera is a nightmare - extremely menopausal and far too irritating, but weirdly fascinating nonetheless. I would be interested to know what northerners think of having their police portrayed like this. I think I would cringe.
I only watched it because it was free! I like living in the USA, but find it hard to watch TV - seems more like constant commercials with show breaks, rather than than shows with commercial breaks. I never realized how good British TV is until I moved here.

4433378,5,B004MW57BY,"The British have done it again...another detective drama as addictive as dark chocolate.  That is no small thanks to the mesmerizing countryside and coastal vistas of Northern England.  But this drama is made even more mesmerizing by the excellent performances of Brenda Blethyn as Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope and David Leon as her protege (and arguable surrogate son), Detective Sargeant Joe Ashworth.  DCI Stanhope makes for a refreshing change from the waistcoat-laden, distinctively male feel of many detective shows (although admittedly, many of them are my favorites).  She is a woman in charge of a team of largely men, and doesn't shrink from the task - her manner is gruff, at times mercurial.  She is persistent, even obsessive, in her pursuit of the truth.  Yet, she can charm any witness or suspect with a sympathy that is sometimes real, sometimes feigned.  Blethyn is truly a joy to watch as she brings Vera to life.  I am ashamed to say that I was not familiar with her body of work before, but I will certainly be partaking now.  DS Ashworth, Vera's boy-next-door deputy, is continually executing the juggling act most of us know all too well -  balancing his loyalty to his boss and to his job with his devotion to his family.  It is perhaps a good problem to have.  At a young age, he has managed to outperform colleagues who have been around a lot longer, endearing himself to Vera.  We see his courage, his intellect, and his work ethic on display, but we also know that part of what Vera likes most about him is that he patiently indulges and manages her volcanic personality.  The chemistry between Blethyn and Leon as a team is excellent, and this drives the effectiveness of the show.  The mysteries themselves are quite good - difficult to predict, with plenty of red herrings to throw us off the scent.  Some of the endings are a bit unbelievable, but that is a small price to pay.  Once you start watching, you won't be able to stop.",1401494400,,1972,4.702623906705539

4433381,4,B004MW57BY,British mysteries are more than just about murders.  Aptly chosen casts  gives this series additional panache.  Brenda Blethyn portrays the prickly Vera with competence; altho one wonders if that character would be employed if she were in the real world,1401321600,,253,5.275

It is in some ways a typical murder/detective show but it has such a great character and actor in the lead role and strong supporting cast that it stands above the rest. The stories always involve deeply human/family problems and the flawed but sympathetic lead detective shows her humanity as well. But be forewarned if you get hooked on the first two seasons of free shows for Prime members, the third season is not free and and very high priced with only an option to buy (12.99 each episode) and with most mysteries you are not likely to want to watch it more than once.",1399593600,,685,4.359375
4433402,4,B004MW57BY,Enjoyed this series  and the people .  I  looking forward to when the next season is available  Good story line,1399507200,,111,4.4
4433403,5,B004MW57BY,I enjoy the story line that is well acted . I would love more Vera type series . It's so great when a series like Vera is filmed with such beautiful background,1399420800,,159,4.0
4433404,5,B004MW57BY,Different style whodunnit.  great scenery.  Interesting characters.  Would recommend for any who enjoy shows with real person appeal and thoughtfulness.,1399334400,,152,6.5
4433405,1,B004MW57BY,"Evidently the cure for falling down some stairs, is the be beaten on the head and kicked? We use telephones, but never for emergencies, we only hire idiots for police officers, Sigh, yet they solve this case without really any clues. I was really groaning at the end, and thinking I hope I survive this, at least let me find out what this is all about, Evidently an hour. The explanation as far as I could gather is that everyone should be in the nut house. Sadly, the explanation made not very much sense. I really can't recommend this, It's not funny, good, interesting, or fast paced. Plus, half the time, you don't see or know who is doing what, even at the police station. I had to put it on caption, because I couldn't understand anyone. Even then it wasn't much help because evidently it was slang, and you should just understand it. And Vera has this annoying habit of calling everyone ""pet"". That's to help you not know who she's talking to, of course.",1399075200,5,961,4.465909090909091
4433406,3,B004MW57BY,This may be a brilliant series but I just don't connect with it. Vera seems to be just the tough cop she needs to be to run a squad but she deals with her own fears.,1398988800,,165,3.611111111111111
4433407,1,B004MW57BY,Watching someone rant throughout the show when past works shows that can deliver subtle and complex characters is a complete waste of this talented actress,1398902400,2,155,5.24
4433408,3,B004MW57BY,I've only watched a couple of episodes and they were fair.  It's just not my cup of tea.  The lead female just doesn't work for me.,1398816000,,131,4.0
4433409,4,B004MW57BY,"Only watched one episode but it was good.  Just haven't gotten around to watching more.  ""Vera"" is a bit of a selfish character but she gets the job done.",1398729600,,154,4.275862068965517
4433410,5,B004MW57BY,"I got into mysteries through Inspector Lewis and have since branched out to Agatha Christie's Marple, Agatha Christie's Poirot, Endeavour, Foyle's War, Sherlock and others. I found Vera mostly by happenstance--I'd run out of one series to watch on Prime and Vera popped up under ""customers also watched."" Vera is the typical detective featured in shows like this--a lovable curmudgeon. Joe, her partner in crime (or solving it), and she have a great chemistry together. One thing that I was particularly struck by when it came to this series was the cinematography. The landscapes and architecture are just unbelievably beautiful. Also, the mysteries are difficult to solve. After watching so many I thought I'd become quite adept at pegging whodunit but in Vera, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.",1398211200,,822,5.141791044776119
4433411,2,B004MW57BY,"I like a lot of British television, but not that show.  It was extremely slow and boring.  I Just cannot recommend it.  I didn't give it a 1 star because there is definitely worse out there, but I couldn't make it through more than the first episode.",1398038400,4,250,4.276595744680851

4433413,4,B004MW57BY,Enjoyed the story lines and actors. The photograph is a little too dark at times. A  bit like Criminal Minds in the U.S. Sorry to say the only thing I think in a drawback is how they want to always give the impression it is late at night. But overall will watch it again and again.,1398038400,,281,4.017857142857143

4433420,5,B004MW57BY,Brenda Blethyn is great as the very human Chief Inspector. Her side kick does a good job as supporting actor. Very believable storylines; main characters' personal lives touched upon while the suspenseful crime solving takes center stage...Great series.,1397606400,,253,5.684210526315789
4433421,5,B004MW57BY,I love a good story and Vera has good stories. The British know how to write a mystery and keep the people just like everyone else with all their quirks. I can't wait until amazon has more of these to watch.,1397520000,,207,4.073170731707317

4433424,5,B004MW57BY,"I found the series, ""Vera"", quite by chance, and have enjoyed each episode I have watched. The story lines different and interesting and the lead, Vera, is so very different from the formulaic police characters that flood our evening tv.
I continue to be pleasantly surprised with the shows that are being presented by Amazon.",1397088000,,326,4.945454545454545

4433428,5,B004MW57BY,"Brenda Blethyn plays a no nonsense cop.  The character development is excellent.  Her sexy male partner has a family of problems.  Together, they flesh out murder mysteries that are very different in each episode, so I'm never bored.

Tip for Americans:  Put on your closed caption.  The Brits use some phrases that are new to us.....you'll understand them when you read the words.",1396656000,,381,4.968253968253968

4433433,4,B004MW57BY,I ENJOYED THIS VIDEO.  I LOVED THAT VERA ISN'T A PLASTIC BEAUTY AND OCCASIONALLY LOSES HER TEMPER. AND JOE DOESN'T OVERACT.  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS MY INABILITY TO SOMETIMES UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.,1396310400,,202,5.090909090909091

4433435,4,B004MW57BY,"I am on my sixth episode (Season two, episode two) right now and just can't stop.  You have to listen carefully, the language accents are deeper than Prime Suspect or many other British mystery series, but it is great.  She's relentless, witty, and always gets success in the end.  Like many successful detectives, she cares more about her job than anything else.",1396137600,,363,4.82258064516129

4433437,5,B004MW57BY,The person who that statement was correct.  The location of the story line is wonderful.  Can be a travel ad for one traveling in small town  locations. Each program is felling a little more about Vera's life of past and present. Thank You prime time for a great selection.,1395964800,,273,4.530612244897959
4433438,3,B004MW57BY,"The ""heroine"" in this series is so atypical, it is very sad.  I could not get through much of it at all, she is very discouraging in spirit to me.",1395878400,,146,3.8666666666666667

4433440,1,B004MW57BY,"Annoying lead actress. Annoying lead character. Vera can't seem to keep her cool during the investigation. She keeps screaming at her team that they need to find the crucial piece of missing evidence. And with her comically childlike voice and tantrum-like intensity she comes off as absolutely ridiculous.
DIs need to respect their DCI. Need to want to follow them into Hell, if necessary, during the course of an investigation.
I'd have requested a transfer after 5 minutes of Vera's histrionics.",1395705600,7,498,5.160493827160494

4433444,4,B004MW57BY,I like Brenda Blethyn a lot and the stories are well acted.  You might find that as unlike shows filmed in the USA they seem to use a filter on the camera to make it look dismal even when it's a sunny day.  Due to this some might find this a bit depressing and will want to watch something light hearted or fun afterwards.,1395360000,,322,4.015625
4433445,5,B004MW57BY,Plots are very interesting.  Leaves you guessing until the end.  Keeps you interested and sitting on the edge of your chair till the end.,1395273600,,137,4.666666666666667

4433449,4,B004MW57BY,"I liked Vera because she's unglamorous and real.  I like her working relationship with Sgt. Joe, who seems to be a devoted family man.  Vera is tough and cynical, but really cares about ""her"" victims.  The dialogue is a little difficult to understand for an American, but I listened closely and enjoyed the mystery.",1395014400,,315,4.796296296296297
4433450,5,B004MW57BY,"It is very hard to find TV shows, especially detective-type shows, that are clean as far as language and mature relationships go. While some of the story lines dealing with the murders she investigates have sordid details - they are not glorified, and of course have led to someone getting murdered. If you enjoy detective shows, but do not enjoy the extra stuff thrown in for 'entertainment purposes', you may find this one to your liking. Vera's char active is a bit brash, we we find it endearing, not grating.",1394928000,,513,4.711111111111111

4433454,2,B004MW57BY,"Fairly routine police drama set in NE England giving the actors the opportunity to produce ""Geordie"" accents. Brenda Blethyn, a very accomplished actress sounded completely authentic most of the others much less so. Plot not particularly creative, few turns or twists to hold the interest, background shots good, the lead character well acted the others mixed. The kind of show you might watch if it were on in the room but not one to record on the DVR so that you never miss an episode.

But, I do look forward to watching more of this season.  It's nice to see a series that is more about solving the mystery of the case than about sex appeal.  Also nice that there is no vulgar language.  I love the main character, Vera.",1394755200,,365,4.1571428571428575

So far have only watched the first episode of Vera but she's an interesting character.  The female leads in various series seem to be --generally speaking-- a bit more conflicted and/or complicated than their male equivalents, but that is a generalization.
I'd never heard of this series before but will watch it again.",1394409600,,418,5.043478260869565

The cinematography lends a stark and gritty quality to this crime drama, which is well acted by its two main characters.  Theirs is something of a mother - son dynamic, although the younger male partner is the more well-adjusted of the two.  Vera though is gifted at what she does.  The writers occassionally rely a little too heavily on eureka moments for how the often quite complex cases are solved, but it is still an interesting viewing experience.",1393027200,,532,4.877777777777778

Ann Cleeves has written such fascinating novels, these TV adaptations, though changed to accomodate filming, are top quality. Watching these episodes once is never enough.

On regular TV this problem can be fixed by activating closed-captioning to read the words.  But there is no such option when streaming on the net.  However, even with that obstacle I have gone through all the series shows and can't wait for series four which I heard has been OKed.  This show is so rich in characters, plot, actors, locale, cinematography, etc. that it joins that group of series where watching them again can be just as enjoyable as the first.  Brenda Blethyn and David Leon are perfect.  I hope some US network doesn't try to transpose this show to the US.

I enjoy Vera because she is so OCD; a difficult woman with a difficult past who finds loving and forgiving very difficult. Her relationship with Joe, her sergeant is more clear in the second season as Joe's family is brought into the drama. For now, Joe is a forever forgiving, over-worked father of a young family who is trying desperately to keep up with his irritating boss.  Delightful",1391040000,,473,4.839506172839506

Her understanding of human nature helps her ""see"" connections others might miss.

4433512,5,B004MW57BY,"I've seen Brenda Blethyn in several British films and her ability to absorb herself into her characters is almost frightening.  It would be wonderful to sit down with her to find out what she's really like.  In this series, she is an introverted detective, with almost no people skills except when she's interacting with victims and suspects; then she can be utterly kind, patient and understanding until she's gotten what she needs to solve the crime.  Yet, there is something in the character and the performance that makes you long to understand her.  Some clues as to how she became who is is, are given when she speaks of her distant and difficult father, with whom she had a troubled relationship.  Over the series they seem to be revealing more about her youth.  The mysteries are well done, very much character driven and always contain surprising elements and twists that are frequently based on both victims' and perpetrators' inability to understand and cope with each other, their own desires and life itself.
Vera's relationship with her team is also interesting; she can bellow with the best of them, but there is some kindness there when she's reminded that these people are human.  Her relationsip with her her right arm, John, is fascinating.  Initially he cannot get a handle on her personality but when he does he manages to work with her and even understand her.  When Vera attends his daughter's first communion he quietly hands her a gift to give to the child since he knows it simply will not occur to her to do so. In a scene where she has reluctaintly agreed to have dinner with his family, she sits across from his wife and looks so absolutely at sea, totally unable to cope with a simple dinner that it is painful to watch and she abruptly ends the meal and leaves; stunning acting.  Lovely, well done complex stories and I hope to see more.",1389484800,,1868,4.685015290519877

But she gets the job done. And the first season has four well done episodes. Each over a hour long. We need a show like this , as much as I love csi and such , this dogged detective work is  what most detectives have to go through.  This is a great show and it's a drama , with little action but that's ok. the picture looks great, in hd.

However the Brits score once again, and I think that is why we are so deeply drawn into this series - we can identify with characters who are normal, have issues and are not glammed up.

 As Vera Stanhope, Brenda Blethyn is superb--she's a woman with little private life, obsessed by her work, and often very hard on her subordinates -and yet underneath all her spikiness, she has a great deal of feeling and compassion. Additionally the Northumbrian setting provides a moody cloud filled change from the usual urban grit or typically bucolic English village.

The episodes themselves are fascinating--topical, character driven and complex without the over the top guns, chases and bravado of much American television programming. I read that series three has already aired in Britain and series four is being filmed. I can hardly wait.",1387584000,,986,4.963636363636364

They don't give much backstory to her, and in the first episode just seems like a grumpy, demanding boss who lives through her work. It's hard to see why her coworkers try so hard to please her. As you get further into the series, you see the creamy center inside the hard shell, and the connections between the players make more sense.

For those of us who love quiet escapism, this is a series for us. Dark, moody, atmospheric, soulful bits of music enhance scenes (rather than overpowering to compensate for a lack of content). Beautifully well done.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Oh my gosh, for those of you who dislike dark, moody and atmospheric, stay away from the fabulously dark and wet set-in-Seattle series: The Killing - it's FABULOUS for those attributes! I have no self control and sat and watched an entire season in two days and now have to wait a whole year until they produce the third season - aughh. Oh, well...I can always watch again starting from Season 1, Episode 1 - it's a twisty, turny I-KNOW-who-did-it, but aha! - I never do!
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I live in the US and here are some of the British series I watch with a delighted eye for the extra added bonus of VISUAL CONTENT of countryside, village life, clothing, decor, lifestyle, just plain charm (aside from, or in addition to actual story, characters or content) I'm not one who goes for the opulent high class loads of money castles, etc. unless they're land rich, cash poor old manors slightly dilapidated and interesting:

Poirot: Very clean, stark and precise Art Deco - a totally different feel from my other favorites, but just as enjoyable visually - excellent attention to detail!

Midsomer Murders has mostly beautiful, blue skies with high white clouds, rolling green fields, absolutely charming cottages and villages. So many places I'd love to see in person. [Unfortunately, I can't stand the characters of Tom's whiny wife and smug daughter.] Light series despite all the murders and boy howdy there are many, lol! I also love the long length of these.

Doc Martin: beautiful, seaside village life! Blue skies, green hills and fields, narrow lanes, delightful cottages and short ceilinged century old houses. I want to live there.

Ballykissangel: same as above and I want to live there, too. Cute little old, old, old, cottages.",1378425600,,2392,5.422043010752688
4433573,5,B004MW57BY,"Lead cop Vera, played by former comedy star Brenda Blethyn, is realistic, down-to-earth, honest, tough, and kind. Her presence alone makes this series definitely worth watching. I enjoyed every one of the 90-minute (or so) ""stories"" in Season 1 and have already begun watching those in Season 2. I find them lacking in only one regard: The subtitles that were so well done in Season 1 (yes, I needed them to decipher the local accent) are missing in Season 2, and it's a bit of a strain to decipher some of the dialogue without them. Still, it can be done if you can keep the kids quiet and prevent the dog from yapping. Finally, I'll not tell you anything at all about the content because the scenes are too well written to spoil with a thumbnail sketch. If you, like me, are a fan of police procedurals, you will find these episodes realistic, honest, well-written, and thoroughly enjoyable.",1378425600,23,893,4.658227848101266

This TV Vera is not the same Vera Stanhope that Ann Cleeves developed - she is close enough, but very different in many respects. The TV Vera is more sensitive, not so perceptive, and not one to take pleasure in the intricacies of human relationships. Sexy Joe Ashworth -- nothing to do with the humble, naive, wouldn't harm a fly, dumbish side-kick in the books.

If you find Linley too glib and Morse too smug, then you'll love Vera. I don't think I've seen a series with such all round good acting from the leads through the child actors.

4433631,4,B004MW57BY,"I have watched two of the first season, and it may be a factor of Brenda Blethyn's superb acting, but Vera is so thoroughly human she drives you crazy by fits & starts. I think 'human' is the key here, the character is flawed, inconsistent, not superhuman, like-able most of the time, but sometimes you just want to shake her. She loses her temper, is sorry for it afterwards, has a way of solving the crime even when you think she'll never get there. I expect I will watch the whole series because I can't help wondering how the whole group gets on, what the next puzzle will be, who will piss off Vera next ... the cast is very good, the Northumberland area a great setting for both city & country crime.  They seem to walk a nice line between the need for excitement and the dogged police work that usually solves it.",1367625600,,820,4.324675324675325

4433639,4,B004MW57BY,"Havent watched whole season yet, but after first two shows, will definitely follow up both seasons.

Filmed in and around the area I grew up in, its a trip home, trying to identify what is now, from what used to be. I can get homesick watching certain scenes. So locations are great, Acting is very good, a lot of actors I hadn't heard of, doing a commendable job. Ms Blethyn hasn't quite nailed the North East accent, but to non-natives of the areas it is very close.
The two stories I saw were well written, well acted, and believable, I would recommend this show highly.
Availability with PRIME is a definite plus, its free to Prime Members, and shows how your yearly cost does go to paying for itself.

I found these British Detective shows by accident, there are some listed that I have never seen before, but will watch in due course. I do have a question though, George Gently is listed on the menu, but when you highlight it, it states the show is ""Not Available"" now I would think someone should be updating these lists, if not available, why list it. [I would like to see this series and New Tricks offered as PRIME also]

So I do hope VERA just gets better and better, I recommend it highly, the only reason for four stars is that I haven't seen the whole set yet.
Nice to see the North East Coastline again.

Good mysteries, very enjoyable.",1366329600,,321,5.708333333333333
4433641,5,B004MW57BY,"Brenda Blethyn is a favorite of mine so I was delighted to be able to see this on Amazon Prime.
The eponymous heroine of the series is a cranky, exasperating, sharp-tongued,  irresistible sweetie.  The police team she leads pretty much know how to handle her histrionics, so even though they meet head-on over some issues, they know that no one cares more deeply about the job or the people they serve.
The plots get pretty grisly, but the dialogue and plotting is solid and worth the journey.

solving of crime.  If you like police stories where the DCI is a misery guts, then this is for you.  I prefer my stories with a lot more class like ""Lewis"".  You can't go wrong with ""Lewis""!",1363219200,7,457,4.1477272727272725

Vera is a crouchty enigma of a police detective. I'd picked up the pgm on PBS station in the middle of a season. Some the the back story of her start was missing so there was always a whole. Being able to see the series from start to finish (to this point) has been an advantage.
I'm currently watching it on my FireHD. The quality is great. Sound is great.
Each of the stories are twisting and often hard to figure out. The location shots are nice to see with differing non-city (if that's a word) areas of Britian.
Vera and Ashworth, her constant police assistant, have an unique interplay w/each other. The ensemble of actors the complement the police department are a match to the program's different character.

Loved both seasons.",1357862400,,389,4.361111111111111
4433701,3,B004MW57BY,"I don't know if it is because we were engrossed in the Downton Abbey series before we watched this or what.  But this series just did not inspire us to continue watching it.  Vera as a detective is a likeable character.  But the filming was too quick for us to follow the plot well.  And then the motives for the murders seemed rather far fetched.  For avid fans of murder mysteries it might do, but if one just likes a good show, I don't think it cuts it.",1357516800,2,456,4.136363636363637

4433703,4,B004MW57BY,I enjoyed this series very much. It was a welcome change from the rough and tumble series I just completed (The Commander-it was also very good). The setting and soundtrack was pleasing - I was almost transported! I loved how the lead was a bit of a grumblely-gus and everyone fawned for her approval. A welcome change having a woman in a role where she bucked norms of this genre.,1355875200,,381,4.457142857142857
4433704,5,B004MW57BY,"It was refreshing to see a cast of characters within this series who have not been ravished by a cosmetic surgeon brigade of casting agents.  Not unlike the Wallander series but richer in the personality development of secondary role actors.  The public would benefit from increased reality and less fluff within ALL media venues.  Vera, IMO, sets a fine standard for future detective fiction videos.",1354838400,33,400,5.123076923076923

8436258,3,B004MW57BY,"This is your typical British mystery show, featuring an older detective and (in this case) her sidekick. Like many other British shows, it runs 90 minutes, which means that there is a long parade of red herrings to showcase before the climax, when Vera spontaneously intuits the true solution to the murder.

Unlike other British show, which don't shy away from female characters who are not traditionally attractive, this was clearly a case where they had to struggle to make a conventionally attractive actress look dumpy and shapeless. Hence, instead of wearing normal clothing befitting a professional, 90% of the time, indoors and out, she sports an ugly large overcoat and bucket hat to match. The few times we see her without the coat, she chooses flowery blouses and skirts that would put your grandma to shame. To me it came across as unnecessarily weird and contrived. Throughout the series, Vera play-acts being tough in a half-hearted way that makes you wonder how and why anyone would be quaking in front of a woman who seems perpetually on the verge of an emotional breakdown from carrying the weight of the world and a slightly unhappy childhood on her shoulders. Every so often she takes a swig of whiskey from a glass to let you know the depth of her trouble (which remains ambiguous, since the show makes clear that she chooses to live an independent, un-partnered life). At least she's trying though, unlike her sidekick(s), pretty boy Joe and handsome Aiden. Both seem to be there simply there to follow Vera around like golden retrievers and contribute nothing to the action or resolution of the crimes. ""Sidekick, you're with me!"" is Vera's catch-phrase, even after it's abundantly clear that they are ALWAYS with her. The coroners and female researchers (who seem to change almost every season) have a lot more personality and spunk, and a welcome respite from Vera's constant low-level tantrums.

After all that, I must admit I did keep watching until the bitter end. When all is said and done, I'd rate it better than the sad slog that is Inspector Lynley, and slightly worse than Midsomer Murders or Inspector Lewis.",1527552000,,2142,4.898071625344353
8436259,2,B004MW57BY,I'm a big fan of British mystery series and the prospect of a female version of a Columbo character looked like fun but I was sadly disappointed. Fell asleep within the first half hour.,1527120000,,185,4.470588235294118

Jerks. As if paying for prime isn't enough, then they nickel and dime you by splitting up seasons or making you pay different providers for a show.",1521590400,8,365,4.304347826086956
