8292653,4,B001DBPFV4,"I was able to watch this 1941 black and white film on TV along with a half dozen other Falcon films. George Sanders plays a likeable, sophisticated, urbane man named Gay Lawrence who people call The Falcon. The TV appropriately gave the film a G rating. Sanders played as The falcon again, but was later replaced by another actor. The Falcon is a man who is interested in two things: women and sleuthing. As a result, he has been involved in many murder cases, even though he is neither a cop or a private investigator. In this film, he is engaged and his fiance insists that he give up other women and stop getting involved in crimes. He promises to do so, but does not keep his word.
While The Falcon films are interesting as mysteries that The Falcon is able to solve, it is equally interesting to watch because it is filled with humor. We see the cops bumbling and people doing things wrong over and over again. Both the assistant to The Falcon and the assistant to the senior police lieutenant usually act in foolish ways.
The plot in this film focuses on an inventor who devises a way to make synthetic diamonds that experts are unable to distinguish from real diamonds. Criminals find out about the invention and kidnap the inventor and try to force him to reveal his formula. The Falcon is intrigued with the case and despite his fiance, does what he can to find the inventor and solve some murders that occur before and during his investigation.",1509926400,,1454,4.532319391634981

When an airplane makes a ""wobbly"" landing at the airport, an investigation reveals that there is no one aboard and the plane's controls were set on ""auto pilot"". In addition to the pilot, a wealthy industrialist, his personal secretary, and $100,000 in negotiable securities are also missing. Naturally, The Falcon is called in to help solve the mystery. This is a pretty good entry in the series and the identity of the culprit is rather effectively hidden until the end of the film, although there are clues dropped earlier in the movie for the observant.",1258243200,3,696,5.114035087719298
