6707997,4,B00O2QWG28,"What I liked about this is the fact the it gave viewers, a chance to glymps  what it was like in past power rangers versions that haven't been aired in years, for many viewers the older versions went off the air before they were born.",1418860800,,234,4.2
6707998,5,B00O2QWG28,"This is Vol. 2 in the series and has episodes 5-8

5. ""Samurai Surprise"" - Samurai Tribute Episode. Also has cameos from Jayden, Mentor Chi and even the MMPR powers.
6. ""Spirit of the Tiger"" - Jungle Fury Tribute Episode. Casey also cameos.

6707999,5,B00O2QWG28,"The first volume has the first four episodes of Power Rangers Super Megaforce. It continues right where Megaforce left off on the""Battle to the Finish"" DVD

1. ""Super Megaforce""  - Rangers get their legendary modes where they can morph into Power Rangers of the past. Awesome to see for new kid fans as well as old school fans like myself.
2. ""Earth Fights Back"" - My personal favorite of the season and even uses DaiRanger.
3. ""Blue Saber Saga""
4. ""A Lion's Alliance"" - Wild Force Tribute Episode

There are no DVD extras.",1418342400,3,523,4.602150537634409
6708000,1,B00O2QWG28,The worst acting by far was from Andrew Gray.  They need to stop casting models and start casting actors.  He has no acting ability and needs to go back to modeling.  He prevented me from watching the series it was laughable.,1417824000,4,225,4.439024390243903
6708001,5,B00O2QWG28,"This was not the best season, but it was not the worst season either. When the silver ranger was introduced it made the season a lot better. It made it feel a little bit like in space. I just wish the silver ranger was in it from the beginning of megaforce and we needed more scenes with Tommy.",1417737600,4,294,4.086206896551724
6708002,1,B00O2QWG28,"Lionsgate never learns. People want complete seasons, not these stupid volumes. This was a disappointing season anyways. Hopefully dino charge will be better. I encourage fans to boycott these volumes. Then lionsgate will learn.",1416700800,4,228,5.735294117647059
6708003,5,B00O2QWG28,"For the Lion Zord , I would have liked the Red Lion Galaxy Zord to form the mound of the Legendary Lost Galaxy Megazord before the Super Megaforce Rangers morphed it into the Legendary Samurai Megazord . Other than that , the first four episodes are awesome , GO GO POWER RANGERS !!!!! However , it should have had bonus features where Gosie would ancer questions about each episode . Such as : What's with the Pirate theme ? What was the answer to Jake's question that Gosie was going to give him ? Where were the other Wildzords and Princess Shala during episode four ? Why was The Animarium mistakenly called Animaria ? What is the name of the alien armadas race and planet ? Who were the Legendary Squadron before the Super Megaforce Rangers unlocked their powers in episode two ? Why are the Zords in Super Megaforce called The Super Megazords if they are not individual Megazords ? Does Emma like Noah , as in like like ? Why can't the Rangers just morph straight into Super Megaforce mode without first going Megaforce mode , like Noah did in episode three ? Finally , does every power ranger team have to have a Super season ?",1412985600,3,1134,4.430622009569378

6708025,5,B00O2QWG28,"I really like these episodes, each one the audience closer to the last of the season.  The rangers have tough battles to fight and even find out what happened to Robo Knight and have to battle him.  They are able to free him from the control the evil has over him but in the end he ends up not being able to survive the ordeal.  The rangers have to fight new evil beings that want to stop the rangers from succeeding in their mission to free the Earth of all evil.",1436313600,,464,4.076923076923077

6708052,5,B00O2QWG28,This collection of episodes brings Jayden the Red Samurai Ranger and his Mentor Ji to help the rangers by giving them a disc that can help to defeat the monster.  Next they meet Casey Rhodes the Jungle Fury Red Ranger at a zoo where he has a part time job.  Emma and Jake enlist his help to learn how to fight when their weapons are taken from them during a monster attack and he teaches them a special form of martial arts to combat the monster.  Then the rangers get help from a sixth ranger and he explains why he is there.  This is a must have for anyone who likes Power Rangers.,1430006400,2,583,4.132743362831858
6708053,5,B00O2QWG28,This is a must have for anyone who likes Power Rangers.  In this volume Orion is able to unlock every sixth ranger power and his costume changes to show each one of their helmet designs on his costume.  Also the rangers have their energy taken from them and one of the monsters falls in love with one of the rangers and the other monster wants to destroy the ranger to have her all to himself.  Also two of the rangers switch bodies and they have to learn how to be that person but people notice the differences in the personalities and question what caused the change. In one of the episodes Tensou leaves the command center to see the storm that is approaching is struck by lightning and loses his memory so the rangers have to find him and help him remember who he is.  This is a great addition to the collection for Power Ranger fans.,1430006400,,838,4.318471337579618

6708057,1,B00O2QWG28,"Why would you buy this? 5 volumes for 20 episodes, which would cost 50 bucks at the end. Think before you waste your money. This season is a disgrace to the power ranger legacy.

For instance : Who were the Legendary Lightning ( formally Blitz ) Mode Rangers and Prism Mode Rangers and where did they come from? Why was Boring Troy such an idiotic do#ch# in Episode Five  ( Samurai Surprise ) ? Why were there no other returning legendary rangers to lend the stuper mega rangers a helping hand? Why does Gosei know 90% less of anything and everything compared to a real wise mentor like Zordon? And finally, why isn't Alpha Five or Six apart of this season's anniversary special? These questions could have also been answered on the DVD, but noooo, Nickelodeon, Saban and that idiot Gosei are still keeping us in the dark!",1421884800,3,727,4.724409448818897
