8483271,1,B005QD4MVY,Movie is wonderful (saw on TV years ago).  DVD copied from FOX Movie Channel I think.  The first 10 or 15 minutes are OK then image starts to freeze a little then goes berzerk (couldn't stand anymore).  Why don't the major studios put out a nice DVD copy of this film - are you listening Warner Bros???? or FOX???,1359504000,3,313,4.271186440677966

8483273,5,B005QD4MVY,"The Shocking Miss Pilgrim is a movie about a female ""type-writer"" back in stuffy abet quite well mannered 1870's United States society.  The first mass produced Typewriter in the United States was called the ""Sholes & Glidden Type Writer!""  The Sholes & Glidden Type Writer was produced by the gunmakers E. Remington & Sons in Ilion, NY.  According to various online sources The Sholes & Glidden Type Writer was produced from the mid to late 1870's. Just after the ""Typewriting Machine"" was first invented most so called ""Type-writers"" were men.  Most ladies of the early 20th century were consigned to the home or kitchen.  Since the ""Typewriter"" was a new invention few knew how to handle the beast.  Typewriting Schools were quickly established to speed adoption of the Typewriter in the business workplace.  The 1870's era Typewriter was in essence the computer of its day.  1870's

There were VERY few careers for ladies in the work world.  However a very few forward thinking business MEN soon determined that many men simply did not have the aptitude or patience to master this new ""Type-Writing Machine!""  For any woman of quality to work outside the home bordered on scandal no place more so than in Boston where this story is set.  In Boston with its oh so straight laced men and lady folk such things as lady, ""typewriters"" going out and entering the male bastions of Business was well to put it mildly QUITE ShOcKiNg!  Thus the name of the movie The Shocking Miss Pilgrim is very much appropriate.

Miss Pilgrim a mild mannered opinionated feisty young lady fresh from ""Type-Writing School"" is intent on making her mark in the business world starting out as a ""Typewriter!""  Miss Pilgrim arrives in Boston looking for lodgings but NO rooming house of quality in old time Boston would dare rent lodgings to a single unattached lady.  In Miss Pilgrim's search for a the perfect room is met with a LOT of doors slammed in her face.  Miss Pilgrim exazperated and disheartened knocks on the door of another of one of Boston's fine rooming establishments expects to be greeted with the same ugly course attitude followed by a door slammed in her face.  Miss Pilgrim full of rage attempts to beat the rooming house matron to the punch parroting the reasons for rejection she has heard so often before.  Miss Pilgrim is recognized as a fellow Boston outcast by the rooming house lady and is given a warm welcome by all of the strange inhabitants of the house.

Turns out the rooming house is full of odd characters and creative types each with their own quirky screw ball ideas and together they have formed a sort of mutual admiration society.  The rooming house is unitied by a common hate for all things BOSTON!  In the movie there is a killer awesome song about Boston I often sing to myself when I am sad and it lifts my spirits immediately.  The Song starts,... Give up the fond embrace, pass up the pretty face, you're of the human race, But not in Boston,  Think as the neighbors think make lemonade your drink,  You'll be the missing link if you don't wear spats in Boston...  Well I could go on but you get the idea.

Miss Pilgrim having found a place to call home heads out into the world and lands a job at an old Boston business firm that is very traditional meaning very anti-woman in the workplace.  The men in the business do not hate ladies at all they are VERY RESPECTFUL of young Miss Pilgrim.  They fawn over her and are quite distracted by her fetching beauty.  Like most men of this 1900's MAN'S world the male office staff just think having a woman in the workplace is just unnatural.  Well the movie goes on to embrace many feminist ideas and struggles of the early 1900's like the woman's fight for the right to vote.  There are many comedic twists and turns and many musical numbers used to illustrate major plot points.  There are some really funny bits in the movie and at times it gets slightly serious but the movie never forgets it is more comedy than anything.  Betty Grable is a flawless beauty and she is just prim and proper enough to make the role of Miss Pilgrim her own.  I loved this movie immensely and should it ever come back out on DVD you owe yourself a copy of this movie as it is an enchanting movie that tugs at the heart strings and makes you laugh as well!",1336694400,9,4309,4.573663624511082
