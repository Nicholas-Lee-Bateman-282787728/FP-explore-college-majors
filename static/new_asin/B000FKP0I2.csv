8124361,5,B000FKP0I2,"The first story tells of the ""City of San Francisco"" train that became stuck in the Donner Pass area of the Sierras due to several avalanches.  While the 120+ passengers never were seriously in danger, it was only due to the hard work of others over about three days that they were rescued before their situation became much worse.  The second involves avalanches at a ski resort near Lake Tahoe - the employee building was almost demolished and a worker trapped inside.  Again, thanks to hard work by rescuers over several days and the talent of a rescue dog that identified the sole survivor's location, the story ends with her rescue.  The best part was learning that the dog was so excited at her rescue that she ran over and licked the woman's face (just before she was taken to the hospital), and went home to a steak dinner.",1196121600,,831,4.557046979865772
