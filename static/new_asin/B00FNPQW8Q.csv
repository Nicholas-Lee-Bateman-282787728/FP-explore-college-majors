8617221,3,B00FNPQW8Q,"I found this entertaining and very interesting, but I had to knock it down a few stars for being misleading. Cora Crippen disappeared and her husband was convicted of her murder after innovative science of the time proved that scar tissue from skin and organs found in his basement came from his missing wife.  He was put to death for the crime.  But they neglected to state that by DNA testing in 2007 it was proven that the remains were not Cora.  It makes me question everything in this documentary.  I'd rather have a documentary be more forthcoming.",1462492800,,554,4.622448979591836

8617223,5,B00FNPQW8Q,"This is a very good, interesting history at one of the oldest police organizations.  The dvd tells how they came about and how they grow and improved with the invention of forensic and profiling.  The Jack the Ripper case plays a big part in these two things.  If you enjoy Victorian history, Jack the Ripper, criminal investigation, you'll love this dvd.  Very well made.",1418428800,3,372,4.765625
8617224,4,B00FNPQW8Q,"The Metropolitan Police was formed by Robert Peel with the implementation of the Metropolitan Police Act, passed by Parliament in 1829, has insured that Scotland Yard to be on top of their game by harvesting technology through bureaucracy and protecting some fifteen million residents of London with the best talents by solving and preventing crimes before happening. It seems that the grand daddy of all serial killers, Jack the Ripper was able to push the limits of Yard in 1888 by consuming half of his victim's kidney and sending the other half to the Yard in the mail. This documentary offers a good look in creation of the Yard and their crime solving operation during their two hundred years of operation.",1403827200,5,712,4.892561983471074
8617225,4,B00FNPQW8Q,"This is a basic video that will give the viewer an idea of what Scotland Yard is all about, its history and responsibilities. The beginnings of the police force in London are described where it was set up to reassure the citizens that they were not government spies. They were actually forbidden to look into the private affairs of anyone. It was illegal to investigate crimes; but in secret a few were learning how to examine law breaking.

Of course time is spent on the Jack the Ripper investigation and the setting up of fingerprint registries that helped to solve the Great Train robbery. There is fascinating footage taken from video surveillance of the attempt to steal the Millennium Star.
The DVD is 60 minutes long, has scene selection and English subtitles.
Those who wish to learn more about the police force of London - the Scotland Yard might enjoy this DVD.",1399680000,5,872,4.7368421052631575
8617226,3,B00FNPQW8Q,"There are some ""Frontline"" documentaries about the FBI and CIA.  Here is a doc, quite similar, on Scotland Yard.  You find out why it has that name although it is not in Scotland.  They speak about a real-life Sherlock Holmes and a real-life Moriarty.  Jack the Ripper comes up.  I was surprised to learn that they solved a case by finding fingerprints on a Monopoly board.  The work is not entirely gushy.  It mentions that Yard staff have been imprisoned for taking bribes from criminals.  The doc never speaks about diversity among Yard staff, but it stood out to me that most of the interviewees here are female.  I associate Criminal Justice classes with colleges; this work may be too elementary to show to a tertiary educational class.  I didn't get the sense that fighting terrorism is one of their priorities.  While Sherlock Holmes is mentioned, for those who were wondering, James Bond does not get mentioned.",1388707200,3,920,4.796178343949045
