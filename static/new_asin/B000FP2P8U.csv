2581680,5,B000FP2P8U,"Often I think that we hinge our success on material yardsticks instead of something that everybody can attain, which is, to do more than we think we can physically and mentally.  David Horton is an example of this simplicity.  I have watched the film four times and the strenghth of his resolve comes through each time.  I have ran ultramarathons and always have a sinking feeling in my stomach at each race's start due to my mind accepting the pain that we (mind/body) will endure.  This film made me feel that way when David starts off from Campo.

This film will appeal to anyone that challenges the limits of the physical body or the limits that may be placed by the 'norm' of society.  When you watch the film, you will see a man that is humbled by the trail and by nature.  All to often we travel to the woods as an outsider, David is assimilated into nature and accepts the hardships brought on by her.  After viewing this film I was ready to run the LeGrizz 50 Mile Ultramarathon with a new found inspiration in human capacity.",1159747200,17,1035,4.439153439153439
2581681,5,B000FP2P8U,"You'll never tire from watching this documentary.  Being out on the PCT for a week with David, JB, Krissy, Scott, and others I spent time with more than just elite runners, I found lasting friendships that feel more like a family bond.  The film brings you on a physical roller-coaster ride much like the elevation changes of the mountain passes David conquered on his record setting run.  You'll see his serious side, his comical side, and his emotional side through crew commentary, family interviews, and first person accounts.  The music accompanying his adventure is energizing and moving, capturing each scene magnificently.  This film is the perfect gift for you, your running friends, and anyone you feel needs some inspiration to go out and accomplish their goals - no matter what they are.  The 2,700 mile Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada gave David a challenge and through this documentary he challenges us.  Meet new people, explore the outdoors, test your limits.",1149811200,24,985,5.04320987654321
2581682,4,B000FP2P8U,"Nice documentary, but the story is choppy, does not highlight enough of the adventure, and you don't pick up much from it (I've done multiple marathons, I'm looking in to ultra, currently at research phase)  A little too slow for my taste.  You'll watch it once, but not over and over.  Sorry.

UPDATED 3/4/13:
Well, after many Ultra's, including a 50 mile trail, I have earned the right to comment on marathon video's, I love the story, but I'm out to learn from these documentaries.  I still hold my 4 Stars on this one.",1299888000,2,522,4.51063829787234
2581683,4,B000FP2P8U,The Runner starring David Horton is a well put together documentary about the journey from Mexico to Canada via Pacific Crest Trail.  The movie is quite raw and does a fantastic job of giving the viewer an idea of how doing something of these proportions can mentally and physically affect a human.  I recommend this video to any ultrarunner or just a runner looking for some motivation.,1269302400,,387,4.7611940298507465
2581684,2,B000FP2P8U,"I did not enjoy this DVD much, i expected something like 'Running the Sahara' but it was much less interesting.

The idea of running the Pacific Coast Trail is a good one but it was not documented well in this movie. The narrators voice made it even more boring.",1269129600,,262,4.346938775510204
2581685,4,B000FP2P8U,"David Horton's run of the Pacific Crest Trail is an amazing feat - and filming it in it's entirety was as well. This documentary starts well and gives the viewer a taste of what it must have felt like to average 45+ miles/day for weeks on end. It has all the elements of a well-made documentary: ample footage of the run, interviews with friends and families, and of course, the agony of ""da-feet."" I felt compelled as I watched it and slightly unsatisfied at the end, as if I'd just had a sugar-free diet drink instead of the real thing. The end comes too easily. It seemed as if the film-maker... director... er whomever, lost intensity for the project and suddenly, we're at Manning Park. My own aspirations for the PCT may cloud my judgment here. Ultra-runners may love this film, but I'm guessing thru-hikers will feel less affection. We love the trail; David loves the physical challenge.",1250985600,,894,4.6645569620253164
2581686,5,B000FP2P8U,"I'm not an ultramarathoner (yet), but really enjoyed watching this movie. Seeing what he goes through is quite amazing. Even my 70 year old mother-in-law was inspired and amazed. If you are looking for an inspiring movie on extreme running, this one is a much see.",1225756800,,264,4.760869565217392
2581687,5,B000FP2P8U,"What a powerfully motivating story, amazing coverage of a very impressive journey by David Horton. Actual footage of the journey is woven into a number of background threads which add depth to the context. Additionally, the DVD has an enhanced feature where at any point during the video, you can examine a detailed map of his journey at the actual point in the movie. For the outdoor enthusiast, a must have. For anyone considering tackling this journey or one like it, a hard look at the challenge.",1219536000,,500,4.758620689655173
2581688,5,B000FP2P8U,"This movie has inspired many quotes that my husband and I now use for motivation during our training runs.  David Horton might possibly be crazy and I'm not talking about distance running.  Hilarious, quirky man with a passion for running and God.  It would be a great movie to see if you like distance running, trail running, or the Pacific Crest Trail in general.",1208736000,,365,4.671875
2581689,5,B000FP2P8U,"I am a long time distance runner, biker, nordic skier and fast-
packer and hiked the JMT in 2006 and have dreamed of thru-hiking
the PCT for many many years. For my birthday last year my wife got
me ""The Runner"" and I have enjoyed watching it many times. It is
a fantastic film documentary and the scenes, the music and dialog
(and monologue) with David Horton really make this a great film in
the genre. However, I must say that the most ardent fan in our family is my 4-year old daughter who likes watching this film even more
than me! She knows most of lines from memory (for example: ""I am
not a backpacker - I am a runner"", or regarding snow in the
Sierra's ""Do I want that, Do I wish that? No!!"") She was captivated by David Horton's character on screen and I think that is what has drawn us both to this film. It has also turned her into a little runner.  Overall a great film.",1208649600,2,884,4.169590643274854
2581690,5,B000FP2P8U,What is amazing is when you think about the fact that The Runner was shot all on trails while running and hiking hundreds of miles with an HD Camera and the challenge was filming someone who never stops moving.,1208476800,,210,4.410256410256411
2581691,2,B000FP2P8U,"I bought this along with ""Running on the Sun"" and ""Dancing the Bear"". ""Running on the Sun"" was the only decent movie of the bunch. It was filmed by a professional documentary film maker and you get a fairly good sense of what running the Badwater is all about. ""Bear"" and ""The Runner"" seem pretty amateurish by comparison. Of the three, ""The Runner"" is the worst. The director seems like someone more used to making commercials than movies. He periodically throws out nerve-wracking montages of images (20 images in 20 seconds) accompanied by very annoying hyperactive drums. I also didn't care much for ""the runner"", David Horton. Maybe it was too many Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson movies as a kid, but overly emotional, touchy-feely men who will cry at the drop of a hat tend to creep me out a bit. No doubt, considering the type of running he does, Horton is one tough dude, but I prefer guys to be a bit more reserved.",1207094400,10,928,4.596385542168675
2581692,5,B000FP2P8U,"This documentary is very inspiring, and shows the viewer what it feels like physically and emotionally to undertake such a task.  Ultrarunning is tough.  Multi-day events are tougher.  But long trail running takes it to a whole new level of tough.  If you enjoyed Dr. Horton, and like stories about ultrarunners, check out Running Through the Wall.

2581693,5,B000FP2P8U,"""The Runner"" is an inspirational DVD that allows like minded people to see the relentless effort that it takes to complete such a journey. In typical ""Horton"" fashion, it allows others to witness the impossible, remember, it had *never* been done before!  Beautiful scenery from the deserts of Mexico through extremely remote Sierras to Canada.  In Horton words ""throw the mind out there and the body will follow"".  What a man!",1201046400,3,427,4.985915492957746
2581694,4,B000FP2P8U,"A well-made documentary of the record supported thru-run of the 2,650 mile Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail by David Horton. Beyond documenting a record, the movie touches a personal side of David that can serve as an inspiration to all. If watching David wasn't enough, seeing Flyin' Brian Robinson; the first to complete the then-believed impossible feat of thru-hiking the Triple Crown (Appalachian Trail, Continental Divide Trail and Pacific Crest Trail) in a calendar year; in action assisting David's record through the Sierra Nevada, is an added bonus. Go David! Go Brian! 4 stars only because I had wished there was more trail footage.",1184716800,4,646,5.221153846153846
2581695,5,B000FP2P8U,"Without a doubt one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. David Horton is not only an exceptional runner he is also a very interesting person, who comes across as very sympathetic and thoughtful throughout the movie.

The movie is filled with great footage of the run itself and runners from all over the place and just looking at it makes you want to go for a run, although perhaps not AS long as the ones Horton prefers.

I wish there where more movies like this and I would buy each and every one of them.",1179446400,2,517,4.26530612244898
2581696,4,B000FP2P8U,"THis was inspiring.  I ran my first Ultra distance last October (2006) and thought I woudl never do it again.  Having kept an eye on Dean Karnazes as well as seeing thismovie, I'm re-inspired to do it again in '08.  Looking forward to the biography of Dean Karnazes by Journey Film",1178409600,2,281,4.470588235294118
2581697,5,B000FP2P8U,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than i anticipated. David Horton is such an interesting person and it was really great to be able to follow him thru this adventure of his. Also, the movie did show aspects of Horton's life, including his classes at the local college he is a professor, his family, his running routine and his RD'ing.",1174089600,2,337,4.633333333333334
2581698,3,B000FP2P8U,"I wanted to see more of the running and more of details of the physical impact of all of that running.  I wanted to hear about how they dealt with it from a runners point of view.  I think the movie is ok from a broader perspective of the big journey, it just wasn't what I was looking for.",1173312000,4,290,3.8983050847457625
2581699,5,B000FP2P8U,"""The Runner"", a film about Dr. David Horton's attempt to set the speed record for running the entire 2,600 mile Pacific Crest Trail is more than a film about running or extreme endurance sports. This documentary provides us with a glimpse into the soul of a very unique individual.  The film catches Dr. Horton's emotional vulnerability, his personal struggles and the conflict between the love for his family and the love of his sport. This film weaves Dr. Horton's legendary ultra running career with spectacular footage of the PCT.  The director provides us with real time running footage and an emotional ending that will inspire not only the veteran athlete, but anyone who chooses to pursue their life passion.",1171584000,3,716,5.008403361344538

2581701,5,B000FP2P8U,This is an absolutely inspiring documentary.  If you're looking for a little extra motivation and meaning out of your life this documentary brings it home.

JB Benna of JourneyFilm is once again along for the journey and utilizes his unique running & film capture to bring interesting perspectives of the the journey.

The film highlights David Horton's journey to utlrarunning greatness.  Interviews with David Horton, his family, his support crew and other ultrarunners bring clarity and perspective of the man highlighted in the film.  This film will inspire you, challenge you and help you determine what epic adventure you want to tackle.  The scenery is gorgeous especially in the high sierra's.  David Horton sums up the journey by saying we all need someone to help us - we cannot go at life or our journey alone.

8125350,1,B000FP2P8U,"The description of this video from websites and the DVD jacket is misleading. Very little scenery from the PCT is shown, with most footage stemming from just a few parts of the trail and experience. This was all about one man and how special he and the crew seem to think he is. The most interesting part of the film was when Flying Brian helped David Horton through the High Sierra. That was the only part that really did justice to this magnificent trail. Interviews with Horton's family were mildly interesting, but much of this--as well as interviews with David at stops--seemed tangential.",1357862400,2,594,4.776699029126213
8125351,5,B000FP2P8U,"The Runner follows the 55-year-old David Horton as he attempts to break the record for running the Pacific Crest Trail.  The PCT runs from the Mexican border in Southern California, through California, Oregon, and Washington to the Canadian border, a total of 2650 miles.  I won't keep you in suspense: he crushed the record, covering the distance in 66 days, 7 hours, 16 minutes.  So if we round off the 67 days, and take Horton's reckoning of 2666 miles (there were a few off-trail adventures), that would be almost 40 miles a day, every day, for 67 days.  (He did take a day off around day 28, during which he ate and slept all he could.)

I really enjoyed this movie on a number of levels.  First of all, as an introduction to the PCT.  Even though I went to Yosemite National Park when I was 11, I guess I mainly think of California as coastline, cities, and agriculture.  But there are major mountains in California!  (I know, pointing out the obvious!)  The trail  ""passes through six out of seven of North America's ecozones including high and low desert, old-growth forest and artic-alpine country"" so hikers and runners experience quite the range of terrains and views.  Every scene was absolutely gorgeous.

Second, David Horton himself impressed me.  A committed Christian, Horton teaches health sciences at Liberty University.  Some scenes showed him running with his students in his popular running class.  His boundless energy and love of running infect the students, some of whom become ultrarunners themselves.  He loves to run, and attributes his ability to run long distances to a God-given gift.  Horton's PCT record is but one accomplishment in a long career of running ultras.  He's run all the biggees, won many of them, has run across America, run the Appalachian Trail, and is race director for several ultras.

Third, how about the sheer insanity of running that long for that many days!  Yeah, I've run a couple of 50 milers, but to run 40-50 miles, much at altitude and on rugged trails, every day for more than 2 months is inconceivable!  For many legs of his run, Horton had people running with him.  Even experienced, world-class ultra trail runners who ran with him expressed their disbelief.  They could keep up with him for a day, but struggled to imagine keeping it up days on end.  I love the way he fits in with these ultrarunners: a clean cut, middle-aged professor from one of the most conservative Christian universities hanging out with these hippie trail-running young bucks, and not only holding his own but winning their admiration.

This is a well-made video about a great guy and passionate runner, running on a gorgeous, challenging trail, setting a record and having fun.  I find nothing not to admire about Horton, and, maybe, in the back of my mind, can see myself, someday, following in his footsteps. . . . (In my dreams!)",1343779200,,2874,4.788617886178862
8125352,1,B000FP2P8U,"This DVD lacked any redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I know my running movies.  The music was horrendous - how many minutes of epic drum solos do you really need, people?  The narrator was bland and added nothing interesting or inspiring.  Dr. Horton, while inspiring and well-intentioned, really rubbed me the wrong way.  He was flat-out boring.  Even the multitude of times that he cried was boring.  The runners had boring conversations.  The scenes of them running on the trails were boring.  Even their conversations about how they'd all probably die whilst wading the treacherous rivers managed to be yawn-worthy.  I don't get how this movie got so many positive reviews when there are much, much better running documentaries out there.  Check out ""Running on the Sun"" or ""Unbreakable"" if you want a dose of inspiration without wanting to gouge your own eyes out.",1338681600,4,872,5.034965034965035
