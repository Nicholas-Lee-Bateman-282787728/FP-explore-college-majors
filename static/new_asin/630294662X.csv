7832878,4,630294662X,"This might be Busters best talkie at MGM and no Jimmy Durante.  I saw this movie at the Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles in 1996 with Anita Page in the audience.  She spoke and said this was the best movie she made with Buster (other was Free and Easy).  This movie has Jules White's name on it and you can see he reused the court room routine in the Stooges ""Disorder in the Court"".",1406419200,,386,4.12
7832879,3,630294662X,"Sidewalks of New York(released Sept/31)stars,among others,Buster Keaton,Anita Page and Cliff Edwards. This is a so so effort by Keaton,being as shackled as he was with sub par material(gag wise),a stodgy script and poor pacing.
The story finds Keaton as a swell who sends his man(Edwards) down to the tenements to collect the rent. He comes back empty handed but plenty worked over by the street kids. Keaton returns with Edwards and a street fight breaks out. One of the prominent kids on the street has a sister(Page) whom Keaton,of course,becomes enamoured with. In order to get into her good books he throws the kid a party and he ends up stealing Buster's watch. The cops return him home but Keaton presses no charges.
The kid though has made connections with some bad elements in the neighbourhood,and Keaton's efforts to improve the lot of the  street kids gets their attention,and it's not good. Keaton builds a gym for the kids and even puts on a wrestling tournament,and slowly but surely seems to be building the trust of most of them. But the stickler is still the sister's little brother. He gets involved with some local robberies and Keaton finds out about it and tells him to stop his nefarious activities. The crooks thinking Keaton knows too much for his own good plan to have the kid kill Keaton. In a play Keaton and the neighbourhood kids are putting on,a scene comes in which the kid must ""kill"" Keaton(shoot him with a fake gun).When the moment comes the kid cannot pull the trigger. The crooks then decide to take matters into their own hands and invade Keaton's house. They do so but don't count on the kid corralling all his street buddies to go and help him. They arrive in the nick of time and save the day. Keaton and the girl live happily ever after.
This was supposedly the most successful of Keaton's MGM films. It couldn't help it as MGMs booking clout almost guaranteed success of most films. For New Yorkers it certainly had an instant appeal,and by now movies had introduced the movie going public to plenty of New York-ese. But Weingarten's direction was less than stellar and the pace/editing was quite stodgy,stop and start. The gags have no proper build up to them,so as a result you can see them coming a mile away. Any run of the mill comedian of the day could have tackled this kind of weak Keaton vehicle and easily have made it their own. Someone like Charley Chase would have made a big success out of it.
The film is clear and crisp yet this""remastered"" edition still contains many defects associated with films of this age.
All in all a run of the mill Keaton entry. Lumbered by a so so script and lacklustre gags that one can see from miles away,the film never lets itself get off the ground.",1391040000,,2741,4.628336755646817
7832880,3,630294662X,"""Sidewalks of New York"" (1931) was Buster Keaton's biggest box-office hit, even though the comic genius detested the MGM production. Despite his lack of creative control, Keaton manages some brilliant moments in this early talkie - a precursor to the antics of the Dead End Kids. Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards makes a better Keaton sidekick than Jimmy Durante. No match for Buster's silent classics, but more enjoyable than ""Free and Easy"" and ""What! No Beer?"" The region-free DVD features a good 35mm transfer.",1374451200,,509,5.144578313253012
7832881,5,630294662X,"I really enjoyed this early talkie Buster Keaton vehicle. For someone who was ""on his way down"" careerwise, Keaton does a fine job in this tale of a well-to-do landlord (Keaton described these talkie characters as ""Elmer"" roles) who has eyes for a feisty blond (Anita Page), and thus, becomes involved in philanthropy while trying to help a gang of street-smart juvies (one of them happens to be the blond's kid brother). What results is pure comedy during the first half of ""Sidewalks of New York"", then veers into melodrama when young Clipper gets lured into a life of crime by a neighborhood crook. Miraculously, these two elements never seem to intrude upon each other, creating a nice story balance. The story becomes dire when Clipper is ""assigned"" to shoot Harmon (Keaton) in his home, while the boy quickly realizes he's in way over his head.
Deftly directed by Zion Myers & Jules White (the latter gaining future fame by guiding The Three Stooges' film shorts), the film keeps a brisk pace, opening with a riotous street brawl (in which Keaton gets clobbered) & closing with a wildly hilarious fight of Keaton & juvies vs. the crooks. Keaton's verbal & physical bits during the courtroom scene are highly amusing (you'll spot the same bits in The Stooges' ""Disorder in the Court"" short), and the boxing match Keaton participates in to keep the kids off the streets nearly rivals Chaplin's boxing scene in ""City Lights"" in physical timing, brilliance & hilarity. Cliff Edwards makes a mildly amusing foil to Keaton's antics as his associate, and Page makes for a fiery if not likable romantic interest. And of course, there's Keaton at the center of the storm, giving his all. Nobody simply moves the way Keaton does; he's a physical comedy marvel.
For any Keaton fan, this one's highly recommended!",1350518400,,1807,4.87012987012987
7832882,4,630294662X,"Buster called this film ""100% turkey"", but there are parts of it that are rather funny, so I like it.  And besides, anything with Buster is good, since I can't get enough of him.

There are times I'd like to sock Anita Page (who was much better in ""Free & Easy""), because she's so mean to Buster's well-meaning character.  The kids' acting sucks, in plain English.  And the film's opening seems as if it were made cheaply.

Buster's got some cute lines, and he's darling in the clothes they have him wearing.  When he arrives in the midst of the riot at the beginning of the picture, he's at his best; and at the end, where he's moving about his mansion (dressed in women's clothes), he handles his stunts as if he were a younger man.",1338508800,4,734,4.360294117647059
7832883,4,630294662X,"I do recommend seeing this film.  It's an entertaining, rather old-fashioned early talkie movie that also has Buster Keaton in it. No, it's not a good ""Keaton Film"".  In fact it is not a Keaton film at all in the sense that we Keaton fans would like to have it; but as a minor gangster/dead-end-kids comedy-drama with a familiar face, it's pretty good.  It has a big cast, good production values, engaging characters (I don't mind stereotypes if they're innocent), it mostly rolls along pretty well, it's not a long movie, and guess what?  One of the characters is played by Buster Keaton.

If you just consider Keaton to be a ""working actor"" at this time in his career, which he was, he thus is an actor lucky to have a job in a big (and commercially successful!) movie like this.  These were depression years, after all...  Artistically, the question becomes whether or not Keaton is miscast.  But, who else could have played this part so effectively?  You would need someone who can play rich-but-funny, weak-to-strong.  With some re-writing, maybe Eddie Cantor or Joe E. Brown?  Or my favorite imagining is young Cary Grant.  But then, if we're imagining a little re-writing this could have been a stronger vehicle for Keaton. Harold Lloyd could have done it, but he was doing perfectly well diminishing his character on his own at this time.

Of course there are mistakes, missed opportunities and some poor scripting.  (Have you seen any good movies lately?  I mean good NEW movies?  Talk about disappointing!)

One curious element of the script is that Keaton claims to have been an orphan (""Ever since I was born.""). Did he just lie?  If the script were to show it to be true (he was adopted?) then that could help explain why his speech isn't perfect, and (more re-writing) why he is able to transform (regress?) to a physically-capable kind of guy in a fight.  More poor scripting: he is not truly interested in the kids. ""Clifford"" says it directly to his sister, right in front of Keaton, suggestively: ""He ain't doin' it for me.  He's tryin' to get in solid with you.""  Wow, that's brutal... and apparently true.  Keaton is not shown to have a genuine concern for the kids, reducing my sympathy for Keaton's character.

On the other hand, notice he uses the same wrestling moves on Butch in the fight at the end of the film, as the kid named Baloney used on Keaton in the wrestling scene near the beginning?  Keaton sees Baloney do this again later, and then uses it himself, showing a logical development of his skill.  There's some good symmetry here, it's just not strongly-enough filmed to be really noticeable.  I guess Jules White was still learning how to direct.

Some of the problems are not purely by MGM.  For my comfort, Keaton's love-struck youth character could have gone away as early as 1921, after ""Hard Luck"".  In this movie, upon his first meeting with Anita Page (after she slugs him): how much better the scene would have played if instead of saying ""Oh, do you believe in love at first sight?"" (UGH!!!) the camera had simply rested on his face for a moment (and then have Keaton later mention to Edwards how 'struck' he was with that beautiful strong woman).

Many decry the MGM strategy of ""stupid is funny"", but Keaton's accident-prone character was part of his silent-film personae, and it shows up again in later Red Skelton movies, which Keaton had a lot to do with, and in Keaton's own TV show (where he reprises the cut-the-duck routine).  So, he's probably as much to blame as MGM is for this unfortunate comic-character device.  Homer Harmon might have been the same character even if the script were written by Keaton.

A few scenes go on a little too long and are not as funny as they might have been; some of dialogue could have been trimmed down, and some scenes with Keaton not doing much would have worked better at a slightly faster speed (like carving the duck). But the movie has many positives: Buster looks alert and in good health to me.  Except for a couple of dumb lines, which may have been intentionally silly, I did not have a big problem accepting his scripted speech, nor did his middle-class accent bother me.  There is a fair amount of action right from the start, and after a funny courtroom scene that had me chuckling, the gag with the flower made me laugh out loud (even tho I was watching alone).  Keaton shows resourcefulness in his way of ""persuading"" the kids to visit his gym, and I was happy to see him unafraid to assertively kiss the girl.  The boxing scene has a funny ending, he does good pratfalls throughout the movie, and gets in some particularly good leaping, jumping and tumbling in the finale.

The image on the new Warner ""On Demand"" DVD lacks detail in the darks, but is otherwise excellent, generally clean and clear if a little soft in some of the long shots.  The sound is clear and intelligible, better than the ""Doughboys"" DVD.  Of course you cannot play this in your computer or computerized movie-system due to Warner's anti-rip copy protection, but it will play just fine in a Blu-Ray or regular DVD player.

So: four stars for the DVD quality, three stars for the movie itself, and since I can't combine the two and do a 3-1/2 star rating, I'll go with four.  It's not a true ""Buster Keaton Film"", and you might not want to watch it twice (although I have), but for a lazy Sunday afternoon it's a pretty good old-time movie WITH Buster Keaton in it, just needing a little editing to make it a bit tighter.  If you could put it on Final Cut, I bet you could do it yourself.",1323475200,7,5569,4.59412955465587
7832884,3,630294662X,"Of the seven talking pictures Buster Keaton did at MGM, this has got to be the worst. It was Keaton's fourth talking picture, released in the fall of 1931. Buster plays a millionaire who falls in love with Anita Page's character. To be close to her he builds a gymnasium for the rowdy youngsters in the neighborhood, one of whom is her brother.

Keaton had been lured to MGM with promises of plum movie scripts, and this is what all of those promises came to. All of Keaton's talkies largely cast him as a bumbler rather than the resourceful fellow he cast himself as during his years as an independent filmmaker, but some of them worked to some degree in part because of the artful hand of veteran comedy director Edward Sedgwick. This time, Sedgwick was busy and MGM assigned Jules White and Zion Myers to the task of directing. The hitch here is that the pair were the directors of MGM's successful all canine Dogville Comedy shorts, otherwise known as ""The Barkies"". If you've seen ""The Dogway Melody"" short on the Broadway Melody of 1929 DVD, you've sampled their work. Their reward was to be moved up from dogs to people, starting with Buster Keaton. Keaton couldn't help but be insulted, and it's no wonder he began to drink quite heavily during this period.

Oddly enough this picture was a success at the time it was released. Today it seems largely unwatchable. One interesting thing to note in this film is how Jules White relied on physical comedy of the fast and violent variety. This served him well as head of the Columbia shorts department where he worked from 1934 until 1958, and where he directed the studio's busiest comedy team, The Three Stooges. In fact, there is one scene in this film that is almost identical to the early Stooge short ""Disorder in the Court"". However, this is just not Buster's style.

I disagree with one of the other reviewers when comparing this to ""The Passionate Plumber"". I actually think that film is considerably superior to this one. There Keaton is not the total bumbler he is in this film, but instead is quite the inventive problem solver throughout. Warner Home Video has released the first three of Keaton's MGM films in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buster-Keaton-Collection-The-Cameraman-Spite-Marriage-Free-Easy/dp/B00049QQ78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buster Keaton Collection (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy)</a>.

7832885,3,630294662X,"""Sidewalks of New York"" (1931) was Buster Keaton's biggest box-office hit, even though the comic genius detested the MGM production. Despite his lack of creative control, Keaton manages some brilliant moments in this early talkie - a precursor to the hijinks of the Dead End Kids. Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards makes an ideal sidekick for the Great Stone Face. ""Sidewalks of New York"" certainly doesn't compare to Keaton's silent masterpieces, but it's less painful than the MGM disasters of ""Free and Easy"" and ""The Passionate Plumber.""",1099872000,2,535,5.232558139534884
7832886,4,630294662X,"Buster plays Homer Harmon, a wealthy landlord of tenement buildings in a poor Irish neighborhood of New York City. He falls madly in love with the older sister of a teenage delinquent, whose gang is defacing his property. In order to win favor with the sister, Buster builds a gym for these unappreciative brats. The gang uses dialogue like ""yer yella"", ""you big lug"", ""you mugs"" - sort of like pre-Dead End Kids, but not as serious.
One of the best scenes in the film is where Buster gets beat up a lot while trying to teach the youngsters wrestling and boxing, something his character knows nothing about, and borrows techniques he used in the 1926 silent ""Battling Butler"". His partners include his co-star Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards (who growls at him), and what is probably a 1931 junior wrestling champ hired for this film, a guy named Baloney (who really shows him a thing or two).
Another good scene is where Buster and Ike put on a show to raise money for the neighborhood. Bus dresses up like a gypsy girl and flirts with Ike, who's playing the part of a Russian Cossack. Later, he appears in drag again when he's mistaken for a crook named the Blonde Bandit and appears in a dress that struck me as looking like it was borrowed from Joan Crawford's dressing room.
Buster disliked ""Sidewalks of New York"" the most out of all the features he made at MGM between 1928-33, but it's really not that bad. The pacing moves along without dull moments, and it made a lot of money at the box office, probably because the subject matter attracted kids. But it wasn't up to his standard of quality entertainment (he knew he could do better).",972432000,6,1641,4.566101694915254
