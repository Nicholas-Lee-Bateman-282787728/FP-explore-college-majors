Unfortunately this is about the last season  I think worth getting since casting changes have began, new characters added, and good story lines are going away...

4958378,5,B00650RWZA,"Love the wholesomeness of this show and fondly remember watching it as a young girl.  I love the simplicity of it and how the family, even though they would be at odds sometimes, would always work together towards a resolution.  Doesn't matter which season you watch, the premise is always the same - faith, family and work - all good things and the show is definitely family friendly.  In this day and age, I'd recommend it to young kids especially so they could see how they have it made today.",1437609600,,496,4.488888888888889

4958516,5,B00650RWZA,"Well I know I have said this about other seasons, but this season realllly is the best! Obviously my family loves The Waltons and we have the first five seasons. Just as in season 4, this season focuses more on the family's personal issues, and allows all the actors to blossom andshow off their acting abilities--you don't see this quality of performance on t.v. any more. All but a few of the episodes are family friendly. The episodes that my kids did not want to see, due to too mature themes, were The Cloudburst (someone gets very sick and it's scary), The Inferno (about the Hindenburg crash). This is the year that the actor who plaid Grandma had a stroke in real life and is not present in the last disc but it is handled with grace and love and it is an important life lesson. I feel that this season has the best writing and directing as well. If you have the first four, definately get season 5!",1403654400,9,907,4.372781065088757
4958517,5,B00650RWZA,I watched the Walton's when they were on TV and I have several seasons on DVD. Real life portrails of family live in a large family. Intelligent writing and supurb casting. I enjoy watched the episodes over and over.,1402963200,2,216,4.564102564102564
4958518,5,B00650RWZA,"Anyone who loves The Waltons has to purchase this last season starring Richard Thomas. The kids are growing up and the problems they face are bigger.

Ralph Waite, Richard Thomas, & all the ""characters"" these adults & then children became are absolutely timeless!  When Ralph Waite passed, the next day I ordered all 9 (nine) Seasons just because I can afford, my husband allowed me to & I simply wanted them in my ""collection"" of the best years gone by.  The Waltons' fans can't go wrong!  BTW, this is the first time I bought all the complete Seasons at one time & not the way I originally started collecting, 2 (two) Seasons per month.",1398384000,2,736,4.470149253731344
