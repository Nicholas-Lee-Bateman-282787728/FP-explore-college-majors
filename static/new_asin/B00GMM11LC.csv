It gives you their humble college beginnings, to their eventual breakup due to the death of Graham Chapman. You'll get to see in depth interviews from all five of the surviving Pythons, and archive interviews from their one passing member. The features are more extended interviews with the cast members, and plenty of stock footage.",1466553600,,417,5.057971014492754

8624624,3,B00GMM11LC,"Well, if you are a chronic Monty Python fan,  and that you've seen everything Python that you think you could possibly have already seen, and you've got absolutely nothing else to do, well this is the last thing you've got left to watch since your Monty Python fix has been overly saturated to all bloody hell over the years since you were a kid.

This is a documentary on the journey of the six pythons, including some ""blah-blah-blah"" bits from Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes and a few of today's famous as well as some somewhat recognized comedians as well. And from some not-so-funny characters who THINK that they are comedians but that's the only thing that makes me laugh about them. Anyway, it's got some great moments, and it's got some rather dull moments. And it's got some fabulous moments.....well, that's almost the truth.

Anyway, by the viewing of some of the classic skits from some of the original Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes, I am convinced that the original show from 1969 to 1974 will never be remastered to a more pristine and tolerable visual experience.

I've got american TV shows on DVD that look as high definition and pristine as practically any movie made today.  So, why do all the Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes look so bad?  Did they lose the original films?  Each episode looks like a VHS copy of a VHS copy, of a VHS copy. And that IS very much the truth.

Oh well, I've watched all 45 episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus over and over again, and I think the last time I've watched any of my DVD's was probably more that 10 years ago and with no desire to watch them again because their video quality is so bad.  If they could be remastered from the original source tapes (that may or may not exist.  They could be held for ransom somewhere, who knows), I would definitely reconsider buying the series one more time.

But, until then, these DVD's will just continue to collect dust on my shelf.",1408665600,,1950,4.574712643678161
8624625,3,B00GMM11LC,Not great like The Holy Grail was.  Probably nothing will top that movie.  My very favorite.  It is such a parady of how stupid life on earth really is!,1406246400,,152,4.172413793103448
8624626,5,B00GMM11LC,"As far as I am concerned, Monty Python Almost The Truth is one of the better offerings on the groups history.  It is complete and gives you plenty of clips and information to satisfy most Python fans, without overdoing it.  The only problem is that there are three versions.  The original version is 6 hours long and so good that you can watch it from beginning to end without realizing how long it is.  Unfortunately there was a ""Theatrical Release"" which Amazon sells without giving any more information so you don't know it is only an hour and forty minutes (unless your are already in the know) until you watch it. There is also another version which is only 4 hours long, so be sure what you want and are looking at before you buy it or, like me, you will have an unpleasant shock when you watch it.",1284854400,8,804,4.375838926174497
