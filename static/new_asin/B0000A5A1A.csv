7996132,1,B0000A5A1A,"Don't waste your time.  Cedric is talented, he's hilarious but appears all of ten minutes.  The rest of the time you are subjected to his guest comics.  One of them had a (singular) good line.  Every remaining second I spent wondering if Cedric brought on these absolutely lame comedians to make himself look good. Their routines were juvenile, incoherent and definitely amatuer. I write this review hoping to discourage people from buying and therefore discourage such inane and tasteless humor from comedians of neglible talent.  Don't waste your money!  Instead get
Cedric's ""Taking you higher"".  It is classy, inteligent humor that will have you laughing so hard it hurts.",1216684800,,676,5.146788990825688
7996133,4,B0000A5A1A,"I decided to check this out because I had seen the first ""Starting Line Up"",plus I love the Platinum Comedy Series. Cedric's performance on here is funnier than ever. I love his jokes about Snoop Dogg. I hate Snoop,so I was glad to hear someone make fun of him. The other comedians on here are funny also. The first comedian on here,Leon Rogers,makes fun of the music I like,but he is hilarious! I love his impression of DMX.The second comic,Nema Williams,is not funny at all. I am white,so I like white comics,but I hated the way he was telling all black jokes to get laughs. The third comedian on here,Rodney Perry,was funny,but he cussed WAY too much. The last comedian on here is Prescott. He was funny,but again, he cussed WAY too much. This is better than Volume 1,but not as good as ""D.L. Hughley Live"" or Dave Chappelle's ""Killin Them Softly"".",1066867200,2,851,4.605263157894737
