326689,1,6301348869,"From the file `Everybody has to Start Somewhere', we are graced with Oscar winner Kevin Costner's first film...now, everyone has to pay their dues, especially in Hollywood, so there are probably a lot of films that now popular actors wouldn't mind if they never saw the light of day. Tom Hanks appeared in a relatively lame horror film called He Knows You're Alone (1980), while Tom Cruise made an early starring appearance in the teen sex romp/road trip type comedy Losin' It (1983).  And let it be known that one of Billy Bob Thornton's early on screen appearances includes the seminal schlock/sleaze film Chopper Chicks in Zombietown (1989), one I'm sure he'd rather forget.  Seems only fitting that Kevin Costner should have his first starring role come from a soft-core sleaze film titled Sizzle Beach U.S.A. (1986) aka Malibu Summer, aka Malibu Hot Summer (I believe the film was produced and released at an earlier date than what's listed here, probably sometime in the late 70's/early 80's).  Directed by Richard Brander (Hell's Bloody Devils), the film stars, along with Mr. Costner, Terry Congie (Shadows Run Black), Leslie Brander, whom I think is married to the director, and Roselyn Royce (Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams).  Also appearing is Robert Acey (Angel) and the diminutive Peter Risch (Ghoulies).

The film begins with still shots from the film, while playing in the background is some truly hideous ubiquitous rock music common in the early 80's, sounding a little like Jethro Tull but only if lead singer Ian Anderson suffered castration and the rest of the band forgot how to play (get used to this particular song, as you'll be hearing a whole lot more of it throughout the movie).  Soon we cut to a roadside diner, where a woman named Janice (Congie) finds herself locked in the ladies room because the doorknob fell off.  She's rescued by two other women, Cheryl (Royce) and Dit (Brander), who apparently had the same problem earlier, and ended up missing their bus to who knows where.  A thankful Janice recommends the two girls come with her, as she's going to a beach house inherited by her and her cousin, Steve (Acey).  As the three arrive, we come across the first of many nekkid scenes as Steve's trying to boink the neighbor lady, who also happens to be a call girl, entertaining men in her home (I think Steve was getting a freebie).  Introductions are made, and so on...later on the Cheryl and Dit go to check out the beach, while Janice decides to shower, and we get a nice shot of Steve ogling her through the semi-transparent glass...did I mention Steve and Janice are supposed to be cousins?  Yuck...from here various loosely connected threads involving the women begin.  Cheryl, who's a fitness nut, meets some schlub on the beach who helps her get a job as a high school girls gym coach, Dit, who likes riding, meets up with John Logan (Costner), a young and wealthy ranch owner, and Janice, who seems interested in pursuing a singing career enlists in a local contest in hopes of landing a recording contract.

On a commentary track, producer Eric Louzil (Class of Nuke 'Em High Part II: Subhumanoid Meltdown) claims there was no concept when they were making this movie, and that becomes obvious about five minutes into the film.  It's really just a series of lame vignettes propped up by numerous scenes of T & A...and lots of it...and all the women in this film are well endowed, either artificially, or naturally.  The notion of three women and the guy staying together fostered a bit of a `Three's Company' feel (I know there was four of them), as well as the few scenes that could have come from script of the show.  One scene involves Steve and Janice trying to fix a leaking bathroom sink, and Dit, having to use the washroom, finds herself listening to the two from the other side of the door, as Steve tries to work the pipes with a wrench, with Janice assisting.  From her vantage point, Dit hears things like, `It won't fit', `Have you ever done this before?', and `Wow that's tight' which she assumes to be in the context of their making with the boom boom, but they're actually just fixing the sink...get it?  Har har...sadly, there's really not much of this humor throughout, as the film tried to interject a great deal of lame drama like Janice having to deal with a sleazy recording promoter, and Cheryl having to chose between love and her career...there were any number of creepy parts throughout the film, like when Cheryl is interviewing for the job of gym teacher and she finds the principal is preoccupied by overactive libidos, but the creepiest part by far is the relationship that develops between Steve and Janice (they're supposed to be cousins) as they're forced to share a bed, and end up sharing bodily fluids....ick.  Well, at least if you're looking for the action of the nekkid kind, there's lots of it here, as even Mr. Costner gets in on it, doing the boingy with Dit, who happens to be the director's wife...I've changed my mind, that is the creepiest element of the film, the director filming his wife getting it on with another...ew.

The full screen picture (1.33:1) on this DVD (which claims to be the `director's cut') looks okay, but the audio is lousy.  I think the poorness of the audio is inherit to the film, rather than a poor transfer, as often the dialog is soft and overshadowed by the background music, which didn't really matter as the dialog was awful.  There's a ton of special features, mostly involving Troma material, but there are a few extras relating to the film itself, including a commentary track by producer Eric Louzil, who essentially cops to the fact the film was made more so to see nekkid women rather than telling a story.

326690,1,6301348869,"The previous reviewers of this film intimated that this was ""bad even for Troma,"" without realizing that the movie was made years before Costner's stardom by a group of indie filmmakers. Troma bought the movie, then called ""Malibu Hot Summer,"" and re-released it as ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" just as Costner was becoming a household name. Even with a new name, it's still a stinker. The film about 3 women ""discovering themselves,"" and for one of the women (the director's wife!) that involves getting it on with Costner, who plays a young, wealthy ranch owner. Check out his midget sidekick! Silly and full of awful, early-era breast implants.",1030492800,5,640,4.990654205607477

Three girls going to california to make their dreams come true and thats the plot almost sounds the same to the new britny spears movie but that ones probly worse. Yes Keven Costeners in it but not as much as the cover suggests. The film has lots of naked women in it with  implants the producer says in the commentary.
 Extras are great as with any troma dvd. There is a commentary,2 interviews,troma related materal and t.i.t and tour of troma.
 The movie's horrid and hard to watch with all the hippie music and boring story I don't suggest anyone buying this dvd it's not worth it even with the nice extras.",1013990400,,684,4.412698412698413

With no identifiable plot and stars changing roles throughout the course of this movie it's virtually impossible to  watch. On the plus side this is a Troma movie and it is filled with naked  girls for no good reason. Because Of this fact I would highly recommend  this to a friend.",942796800,12,449,4.658227848101266
326741,2,6301348869,"Malibu Hot Summer or Sizzle Beach, USA is a 70s beach movie that can only be described as soft core porn. The only thing of note is that (young) Kevin Costner is in the cast.

Even by 1970s standards, this is poor film making. It goes from one nude scene to the next, only separated by ametuer music tracks and cheap leisure suits. The cinematrography looks like it was shot with a thrift store camera. More money went into breast implants than production costs.

The implants are generously displayed at the rate of two every five minutes. This was filmed before the bikini waxing trend was even popular in Brazil. The main actresses are attractive, but 70s attractive, with Farrah hair styles and clunky bikinis that would make a girl cringe if she had to wear one on the beach at Malibu today. Think your grandma's bikini, here.

The acting style throughout is as if everyone were on depressant drugs. There is no excitement anywhere in this film, even in the sex scenes. If the actors were any more laid-back, they'd be asleep.

In other words, I kinda liked it.",1469318400,,1066,4.594736842105263

I just became a fan of Kevin Costner after seeing the movie, The Bodyguard so was looking to watch other titles that he starred in. He is in less than 10 scenes and the movie does not even make sense. I fast forwarded all other scenes and am glad I did not buy it. The story is so lame!  This must be the movie that I read Kevin Costner said he regretted making in the beginning of his career and sworn he would never act again if that was all the m acting job he can get!",1464220800,,648,3.9692307692307693

326765,5,6301348869,I remember seeing this movie many years ago on cable TV and decided to get it on DVD if available and I am glad it was. While it is not the best in plot or acting the scenery is great.,1341878400,,184,3.625
326766,4,6301348869,"First of all, it's not ""Schindler's List"" and we all should know that. The director even says, in an included interview (GREAT extras on this DVD, which contribute to the high rating), that there WAS no script...the actors and production team got together on weekends over the course of about a year and just kind of improvised the material.

That does explain a lot, because this thing has no plot whatsoever and basically meanders awkwardly from one female nude scene to the next, which is why it's FRIGGIN' AWESOME. When other reviewers said that there is ""a lot"" of nudity in this film, I would not have guessed this much. We're talking maybe 15 separate nude scenes, and the majority are of good quality. Every female cast member (most of them are GORGEOUS) disrobes and nearly all do full frontal, and for the most part the actresses are lit well enough actually to see it.

Kevin Costner's role is of course grossly overstated, since he's on the box cover and such--that's probably no great surprise to anyone. But his talent actually is quite evident. He plays a ranch owner in a medium-sized part.

Also overstated is the word ""beach"" in the title, because this is far from being a beach movie. There are a few beach scenes, more bikini scenes away from the beach. But nothing about it feels like typical beach or bikini movie fare. In fact it's so hodge-podge from the aforementioned lack of a script that you'd be hard-pressed to come up with any appropriate genre for classifying...anything from sexploitation to drug culture to (believe it or not) musical. This last one actually probably is closest to the mark, as one of the only continuity threads is the singing of the absolutely breathtaking Terry Congie--I haven't figured out if that really was her singing.

One other note: There is no way that this movie was released in 1974. Nor, clearly, was it originally released in 1986 as the post-dated credits would have you believe. I can't quite figure out when it was shot or released, but it was sometime between those two. Based on clues from the sets (clothing, furnishings, etc.) I would guess very late '70s. For instance, there is a portrait of President Jimmy Carter on a desk in one scene, so obviously that dates the shooting after 1976 and likely before 1981.",1328572800,5,2286,4.736180904522613
326767,5,6301348869,The movie was terrible but Kevin Costner WAS good! So funny to see him at age 19. He was the only good thing in the movie.,1274486400,,122,3.730769230769231

326769,1,6301348869,"Sizzle Beach is not a ""movie"" at all; it's a piece of film that outlasted

it's original venue -- Arcade porn videos -- because it contains the

earliest views of Costner as a teenager in a movie. Worse than home movies, there are no actors in this film, only anatomy, and the ""quality"" of color, etc. is deplorable. That said, for fans of Kevin-the-C you will be amazed at

the quality he projects on screen. It's all there, the handsome sexy

persona of the all-American wise guy. He leaps off the screen at you.

Dated 1974, it's hard to believe what he could do with his eyes even

then, and with no help from any skilled director or technician.
