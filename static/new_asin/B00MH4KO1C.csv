However around the ears is the biggest let down for me. The ear paint transfers over where the hair should be just a little. Enough to kinda irritate me when i look at it. Other than that its great. Oh and i have a slight defect under the right eye. A straight thin line that did not get paint. Not bad but I noticed it (no one else probably will). The blu-rays are great. Dawn of the planet of the apes includes the 3D version which is nice. I think the booklet and 4 cards are unnecessary. Other than that I'd say go for it. I pre-ordered it straight from Fox when Dawn was still in the theater. I think it was $89 with free shipping. Well worth $90. I'm thinking the $100 plus is a little much. You might wanna wait. Thanks!

12/4/2014 UPDATE: A Subscriber to my You Tube channel just informed me he purchased this from BestBuy for $89 free shipping. Amazon may price match but if not go there.",1417478400,26,1312,5.659898477157361
6577667,5,B00MH4KO1C,"Every year for San Diego ComicCon, Fox brings it and sells what ends up being one of the most collectable Blu-Ray packages of the year; the kind of thing that real collectors drool over.

This year was no disappointment! Sadly, Fox didn't Make this year's offering a limited edition release like they did the Predator and iRobot busts of the past, but they did put out a well-detailed, and I dare say intimidating work of art with the Caesar bust.

It's basically painted plastic with distressed face paint, and reasonably lifelike angry eyes. Seriously, it's almost spooky looking directly at them, especially since it's roughly the size of a real ape's head!

Words don't really do it justice, so I included some pictures.

It's a worthwhile purchase for any fan of the series or collector of awesome Blu-Ray cases.",1417392000,9,817,4.856115107913669
6577668,5,B00MH4KO1C,"Got the set early from a retailer that put it on the shelf too soon. What I can say, amazing, and I mean amazing detail on the sculpt. It's extremely lifelike, more than the film. It is almost lifesize. I wasn't going to purchase it, though seeing it in person in the store, I had to get it, and at only $80.  The back has a drawer that opens to hold the two films bluray sets. They come in the same cases you will find on the shelf at the store. It comes with Rise of the Planet of the Apes bluray set (with the newer slipcover) and Dawn in 3D. It also has a folder containing a nice booklet on the films, as well as a series of pictures showing how the bust was sculpted and made with scanning tech. I believe WETA designed the sculpture. All in all the best bluray set I have ever seen, speaking for the bust of Ceasar of course. The blurays included are great, though the same as you would buy on the shelf. Something else I noticed, the drawer that holds the blurays seems to have enough space to hold a 3rd bluray set. Great for holding the third Apes film that is coming next.",1416873600,14,1083,4.084507042253521

6577670,4,B00MH4KO1C,"I have to say that this collection looks sweet.  It is a take-off on the Ape-Head Collection from the original series here.

http://www.amazon.com/Planet-Apes-The-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B000E6ESG2/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412787806&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=planet+of+the+apes+apehead

I am a little unsure about the price, but that may come down as the product gets closer to launch date.  If I had my wishes they would create a Master Collection of ""All Things Apes"" and put it inside the head of Lady Liberty (or Charleton Heston).  I may have more impressions later so stay tuned.",1412726400,3,582,6.225
6577671,5,B00MH4KO1C,"I have to admit that I was a little hesitant about buying this set, but after unboxing it I'm glad I got it. I just can't get over how realistic the eyes are, but on top of that Caesar's hair has this oilily texture to it that makes it look even more real. The only con that the statue has is that the colors of Caesar's ears are a little off, but the quality of the rest of the statue out weighs this tiny flaw. The Blu-Rays themselfs are stored in a sliding draw at the bottom of the statue, and the only thing I have to mention about this draw is that the plastic is a little thin, but it's really not a big deal. I'm also going to asume if you're considering this set you've probably already seen these films, or are a fan of the series already, so I'm not going to go into detail about how great these films are. Just know if for some reason you haven't seen these movies they're very good.

6577677,5,B00MH4KO1C,"For any movie buff, this item is truly incredible. It's designed by Weta, the same company behind the production of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films as well as Avatar and The Chronicles of Narnia. Using photo-realistic scanning, the Academy Award-winning designers have come up with a piece so rich in detail that you can just see the passion in it.
By far, the highlight of the head bust though is in the eyes. They're so intricately detailed that it's almost frightening. It's the kind of detail that collectors relish.
About the only complaint that I have is the painting of the hair around the ears, which is a seemingly recurrent complaint I've been reading. But, minor quibbles aside, this is still a magnificent piece that is sure to make anybody drool over it.",1440547200,,774,4.698529411764706

6577685,5,B00MH4KO1C,"These new ""prequels"" for Planet of the Apes are amazing...however, that's been written about endlessly.

This set, which comes with a bust of Caesar, is absolutely amazing.  The bust looks great, is made really well, and is an excellent addition to my media collection.

It goes extremely well next to the OTHER Planet of the Apes bust from the earlier movies.

Overall, if you have a chance, snag one of these...you'll be happy with it for sure!!",1435536000,,447,4.766233766233766

6577692,5,B00MH4KO1C,"Back in August, when looking at the Amazon Deals of the Week for Blu-rays, I was surprised to see this set as one of the deals, which I believe had only just been added to the site for preorder. It was only $80 and I loved both of the most recent PotA movies, so I decide to order it, and I couldn't be more happy with the set.
This set includes the Blu-ray, DVD, and UltraViolet Copy Combo Pack of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (the redone cover) and the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and Ultraviolet Copy Combo Pack of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in separate Blu-ray cases w/slipcovers (other versions include ALL of the PotA films, but the American version only has the two most recent films). The set also includes a small booklet about all of the PotA films and even a section of the making of the statue included in the set, as well as four very glossy ape cards. All of these are included in a drawer in the back of the set, and it appears that their is room for another Blu-ray so when the third PotA film comes out, you can add it to the collection.
But the main reason you buy this set, of course, is the head bust of Caesar by Weta, the company who worked on the visual effects of both movies as well as many others, most notably the Lord of the Rings films. They also have their own website and store were they sell high quality (and quite expensive) statues. However, they have not made any other statues based on the PotA films, all the more reason to buy this set.
As I already stated, the bust is amazing! One minor complaint is that it is unfortunately made of some kind of plastic, as I was hoping it would be made of a more solid material. However, this does not at all take away from the quality and detail of the statue. I'm not 100% sure if the bust is life size, but Caesar's head is about as big as mine, so i'm going to say that the bust is life size. The sculpt of the figure, of course, is amazing, and the paint job is just as incredible. Caesar's eyes are actually glossy on the bust and reflect light very well, which give the illusion that his eyes are moist as real eyes are, which makes the bust frighteningly realistic (I half expect it to start moving sometimes). The war paint is done really well, showing cracks around his eyes and different spots where the paint fades or isn't as apparent (and I mean this in a positive way) instead of just globing a bunch of white and black paint on his face. I have shown a few of my friends and family members, and all of them have talked about how frighteningly real it looks.
Overall, this is a great set that includes great movies and a great bust of a great character. My only complaint would be that the current price, $120, is a bit too much, but if you can find it for under $100, I would diffidently recommend it.",1420243200,,2792,4.181818181818182
6577693,5,B00MH4KO1C,"Amazing product some of the best quality I've ever seen on a bust let alone a blu-ray collectors item. Paint application on Caesar is top notch as well as a fantastic sculpt, looks so real in person. You get both movies as well, great value for the money!

6577702,4,B00MH4KO1C,Very nice set and has enough room in the drawer for 2 future sequels. The only flaw in this set as far as I am concerned is the drawer's tendency to slide open when you pick it up.

I think some sets overseas also come with all the original Ape films on bluray. The bust itself is beautiful and close to life size.

The special edition black cased Blu Ray is beautiful, and the time line book wasn't something I thought I'd care for but seeming them hand make each piece just made mine feel all the more special. Definitely worth the price. All the Blu Rays are in great condition and hey you'd spend maybe $30 for both anyway so if you find this head for $90ish you're spending $60 for an incredibly put together case. That has enough room to fit the next 2 movies. They truly planned ahead with this one.",1470528000,,635,4.213114754098361

8672254,5,B00MH4KO1C,"I bought this on the recent Prime July day for an amazing deal and I'm so in love with it!!  Caesar looks so bad aed in person. I will add some pictures but others have left wonderful pics and videoes as well.

The back of Caesar has a little pull out drawer that has both blu ray movies, a little booklet and four cards. The cards are pictures of: Caesar, Koba, Luca and Rocket. These cards are awesome!

If you are planning on buying this and are not sure if it really looks good, it DOES. The whole thing is a sort of plastic and not heavy at all in case your wondering if your getting a stone bust. It's still totally awesome though.
