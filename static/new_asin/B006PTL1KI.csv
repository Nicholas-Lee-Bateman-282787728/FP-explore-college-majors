8502868,3,B006PTL1KI,"Made 4 years after RIDERS OF THE DESERT, this is a bit of disappointment for me.  It is an unusual B-western
because the background of the story involves the Civil War.  Bob looks somewhat out of place throughout the movie.
His character seems out of place with old plantation and military uniforms.  I realize the studio(Republic's Supreme unit)
was trying to make a ""sprawling"" epic out of a B-western, but it looks like they didn't succeed.  Lots of Civil War and
Indian attack stock footages incorporated.",1419552000,,509,4.883720930232558

Boomers know the star of CAVALRY, Bob Steele for his portrayal of shaggy gray-haired and mustachioed Trooper Duffy on TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-TROOP/dp/B000EQ46HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F TROOP</a>.

Mr. Steele was an unusual leading man. Not handsome, due to a Durante-like nose and enormous protruding ears, and with a somewhat stilted delivery, he nonetheless starred in well over 100 silent and sound westerns. Outside the genre, Steele is best remembered as Curley in Lewis Milestone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OF-MICE-AND-MEN/dp/6305081832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OF MICE AND MEN</a>&nbsp;(1939).

CAVALRY is an interesting contradiction in cinematic production terms. Clearly a 'B' grade REPUBLIC picture, especially based on acting (Hal Price is downright awful as the story's villain, while Budd Buster's a stand-out for naturalism), yet it's obvious that good money was spent here on costumes, sets and matriel.

The wagon train sequence is particularly outstanding. We first see this train in a longshot, strung out along a ridge. Its impressive length is most apparent, perhaps two dozen Conestogas. Attention to equipage detail makes being among these travelers quite believable. An Indian attack upon their encircled caravan with a cavalry rescue is now a bit clich, but it's still effective.

Politically correct folks may decry the depiction of liberated plantation slaves and their ""what I gwine ta do now?"" dialect, yet there's authenticity to the scene where now homeless Southern landowners head west, leaving tearful former house servants behind who reverentially sing a harmonized dirge, ""Massa's Gone Away."" Later, we hear another fine black chorus perform an ""Old Folks At Home"" which includes the original Stephen Foster lyric, ""Oh darkies how my heart grows weary.""

As for the story itself, some evil men in league with local Indians want to start a new nation and renew the recently concluded Civil War. Bob Steele is the out of uniform Union captain whose intervention is crucial in defeating their nefarious plans. Nicely scripted, and despite a generally amateurish cast, quite absorbing.

CAVALRY is also available in a good dub on MILL CREEK's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WAY-WEST-50-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B001R1LX0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WAY WEST 50 MOVIE PACK</a>.
