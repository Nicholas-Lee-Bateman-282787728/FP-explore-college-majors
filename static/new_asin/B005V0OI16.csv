8487223,4,B005V0OI16,"This is a good DVD for getting the mindset to get rid of pelvic pain. There is a lot more to it and I suggest reading the book, ""headache in the pelvis"" if you are having problems. Some of the exercises on here might be too much to quickly, like the legs on the wall one.  Pelvic pain is a lot more complex and needs to be treated a particular way. There are good exercises in this though that should be in the routine.",1356048000,,419,3.988095238095238
