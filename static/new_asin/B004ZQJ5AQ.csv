8450402,1,B004ZQJ5AQ,"I thought the major character was greatly flawed and needed psychological help. I saw no development of his personality so the
film was not good in my opinion.",1360368000,,159,4.714285714285714
8450403,5,B004ZQJ5AQ,James Badge Dale who stars in this film is a wonder.  He is one of the best but underrated Actors acting today.  Terrific film and I would recommend it to anyone.,1352851200,2,162,4.193548387096774
8450404,5,B004ZQJ5AQ,"Nonames is a Wisconsin indie film that has a GREAT cast for a film with a smaller budget. James Badge Dale (The Pacific, Rubicon), Gillian Jacobs (NBC's ""Community""), Barry Corbin and a terrific supporting cast. Kudos to the director and producer for pulling that off. No wonder that it won Best Director and Best Ensemble Cast at the Phoenix Film Festival.  I saw it with a sold out crowd at the Wisconsin Film Festival and it received a standing ""O"". I am really hoping to see it again. Filmed entirely in central Wisconsin it offers a very moving story about friends, family and the definition of home in a small town struggling to survive.",1331769600,5,643,4.640350877192983
8450405,5,B004ZQJ5AQ,"An amazing film with a phenomenal cast and incredible writing and directing by Kathy Lindboe.  Definitely worth owning - great depiction of small town life in the midwest and the experiences of a bunch of friends, some of whom want to change their future.  Rent it, own it, see it somehow!",1331596800,5,289,4.647058823529412
