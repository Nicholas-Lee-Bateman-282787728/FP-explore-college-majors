2856428,4,B000R17RTY,"It's here.  The second season of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.  (YAY !)

The nutty escapades of Blooregard Q. Kazoo and his vast camaradarie of imaginary friends continue in this all-new two disc set.  No matter what kind of crazy mixed-up plot conceived by Bloo is involved, it's never a dull moment at Foster's.  Such episodes include:

""Partying is Such Sweet Soiree"" - After Madame Foster leaves town and has driven Mr. Herriman out of the house, Bloo throws the biggest bash the imaginary friends have ever bashed to !

""Everyone Knows It's Bendy"" - A new friend named Bendy causes all sorts of trouble in the house and blames Bloo and the gang for everything.

""The Sweet Stench of Success"" - Bloo becomes a popular deodorant mascot.  But his fame tears apart his friendship with Mac.

""Bloo Done It"" - Bloo becomes ""suspicious"" of a well-liked friend named Uncle Pockets.

""Sight for Sore Eyes"" - A seeing-eye friend name Ivan loses his blind kid Stevie.  Pretty soon all sorts of misunderstood concepts stir up.

""Mac Daddy"" - It's the first appearance of everyone's favorite imaginary friend Cheese !  Plus this episode has a special commentary by Cheese himself.  (That won't end well....)

The season 2 special features are very similar to the extras in season 1.  It, too, has exclusive promos, an ""End of Episode Gags"" compilation, and an all-new gallery of some more lesser-known friends narrated by Frankie herself.  Another addition to the season 2 extras is a new music video called ""Cheese Quest"" starring that amusingly annoying friend in video game-like fashion.  (Plus keep an eye out for that rascal Cheese when you're watching the episodes.)

So basically the second season of Foster's is just as cool as the first.  I certainly hope the other seasons of Foster's are on the way.  Also, look for even more new episodes on Cartoon Network and the new ""Fried Dynamite"" block every Friday night.",1191283200,,1922,4.867283950617284
2856429,5,B000R17RTY,"Ok I just finished watching MAC DADDY with the CHEESE Commentary and OH MY HELLO! This was so funny I almost wet my pants. As a Fosters Fan and a Huge Fan of Cheese I just have to say this is the BEST SHOW EVER.

When ever I am down I just turn on my Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends.

If you have Season 1 Why would you not get Season 2?",1189555200,,340,3.7083333333333335
2856430,5,B000R17RTY,"Wow, I love this show!  I was among the first to get Season 1, and now I'm so excited about Season 2!  The show can be picked up at any time, but in Season 1, we last saw Blooregard, called Bloo for short, causing all sorts of ruckus with his new friends Wilt, Eduardo and Coco, who are also imaginary.  Mac still visits him every day and usually gets dragged unwillingly into the turmoil.  And they all continue to have some of the greatest and most hilarious adventures together!  Their friendships continue to strengthen, and we get to know some of the other characters, particularly Madame F.'s sweet granddaughter Frankie.

It didn't come with a cardboard slipcover like Season 1 did.  I personally see the slipcover as a sign of class and quality, so this might be a bit of a downside.  I also haven't noticed any little surprise features you have to search for (many times called ""Easter Eggs"" because you have to ""hunt"" for them) which is also a bit of a downside because they were fun to look for, find, and watch.  They seem to have been replaced by small appearances of Cheese before episodes start.  But overall, the DVD and its case are excellent.

As for the episodes, they're all great this season!  Well, except maybe one IMHO.  And they are------

-Disk One-
*The Big Lablooski*

*Where There's a Wilt There's a Way / Everyone Knows It's Bendy*

*Partying is such Sweet Soiree*

*Sight For Sore Eyes / Bloo's Brothers*

*Cookie Dough*

*Frankie My Dear*

*Mac Daddy* With special commentary by Cheese

-Disk Two-
*Squeakerboxxx*

*Beat With A Schtick*

*Sweet Stench Of Success*

*Bye Bye Nerdy*

*Bloo Done It*

*My So-Called Wife*

Special features (on Disk 2) include----

*Show promos*  -I don't ever recall seeing them aired on TV, but they're basically ads for the show.  Each features a different imaginary friend, including Bloo and Cheese, being video taped by Frankie, saying why they'd make a great imaginary friend to anyone who might like to adopt them.  Some of them are pretty funny!

*An All New ""Gallery of Friends""*  -A look at the lesser known friends in the house

*End of Episode Gags*  -The fun little scenes CN sometimes shows during the credits at the end of the episode

*""Cheesequest""*  -A special ""music video"" featuring Cheese.  This is actually a fun ""short"" rather than a music video.  It has been aired on Cartoon Network a number of times already.  It features Cheese imagining himself being sucked into a Nintendo-style video game, and hops, runs, flies and swims his way through, collecting points, all while fun video game music plays in the background.

*A Commentary on ""Mac Daddy"" by Cheese*  -It turned out better than I expected, but I have to say I liked the commentary from ""Store Wars"" on the Season 1 DVD better.  It will depend how you look at it as to if you'll like it or not.  Also depends on how much you like the character Cheese.  Basically, Cheese comments on things on the screen like you
might expect a 3 year old to.  If you think you'd find the comments of a 3 year old amusing while watching TV, you might find the commentary cute.  If you'd find it annoying, you might not like the commentary so much.  I personally found it cute, but it just wasn't as funny as the commentary on Season 1.

And now, I look forward to Season 3!  Bring it ON!!!  =)",1188864000,10,3322,4.593162393162393
2856431,5,B000R17RTY,"At last! After purchasing the 1st season on iTunes, I've patiently been waiting for them to release the 2nd season of this wonderfully creative and pleasantly funny series.  But for some reason, they've jumped around and have decided to start selling the fifth season.

No matter! Amazon has come to the rescue buy not only providing me the 2nd season, but also with DVD extras including a Cheese music video, a gallery of imaginary friends, and show promos.  And at $5 less than what the other seasons have been selling for on iTunes.

The great episodes in this season:

""Partying is Such Sweet Soriee"" - 5/5 - A personal favorite of mine, since it's the first episode of ""Foster's"" I ever saw.  When Madam Foster and Frankie decide to go out one night, Bloo decides to throw a wild house party.

""The Big Lablooski"" - 3/5 - Bloo, Mac and the gang join Madam Foster's bowling team.  Not one of my all-time favorites, but it has its moments, like Bloo's desperate attempts at winning a paddleball from a claw machine.

""Where There's a Wilt There's a Way/Everyone Knows it's Bendy"" - 4/5 - A two-part episode. First there's poor Wilt.  He can't say no to anyone, no matter how much of an inconvenience it is for him.  And then, when a new guy, Bendy, comes to the house, he starts causing all kinds of problems.  When Bloo decides to expose him for the troublemaker he is, he leaves quite a trail of destruction behind him.

""Sight For Sore Eyes/Bloo's Brothers"" - 4/5 - Another two parter.  In the first segment, Ivan, a seeing-eye friend, has been separated from his kid.  When Bloo and Mac decide to help him, they end up getting separated, as well.  Next, when Mac takes Bloo to school for Show and Tell, Bloo wows his classmates.  So much in fact, that all the kids go home and make their own, somewhat flawed version of our hero.  When the copies get returned to the house, Mac can't tell which Bloo is his Bloo.

""Cookie Dough"" - 3/5 - I can't really remember too much about this episode, since I haven't seen it in a while.  I do know that Bloo is hilarious as a money-grubbing, slave-driving, entrepreneur.

""Frankie, My Dear"" - 4/5 - When Bloo and Mac both develop crushes on Frankie, they resort to any means necessary to keep her away from other guys.  This episode features the first appearance of Orlando Bloo.

""Mac Daddy"" 5/5 - Who doesn't already know what this episode is about?  The premiere episode of Cheese, that weird, annoying friend that suddenly shows up in Mac's bed.  Great episode, especially since it shows Bloo caring about someone other than himself.

Squeakerboxxx"" - 4/5 - After a day at the arcade, the gand decides to put all their tickets together for a better surprise.  They end up selecting `Harry Elefante' (loved this!).  Too bad Bloo breaks the toy the first time he plays with it, and must work desperately to win more tickets and get another prize before the other's realize it.

""Beat With a Schtick"" - 3/5 - Bloo, being Bloo, manages to offend a rather large new friend, who challenges him to a fight at 4 o'clock.  It doesn't help that everyone else in the house is looking forward to Bloo's challenge and is taking bets against him.  A cute episode, but they've produced better.

""The Sweet Stench of Success"" - 4/5 - After appearing in an `Adopt a Friend' spot on the news, Bloo becomes the mascot for DEO, a deodorant brand.  Unfortunately for our dear friend, his new manager isn't that nice of a guy.

""Bye Bye Nerdy""- 4/5 - After seeing Mac doing homework during recess, Bloo is convinced that Mac is a nerd.  Taking it upon himself to make his friend cooler, Bloo turns Mac into a walking ad for 1987.  A great episode! I loved the 80's jokes.

""Bloo Done It"" - 5/5 - When Uncle Pockets, a beloved professional friend, returns to the house, Bloo is determined to find dirt on the guy.  Using the house newspaper and his ace reporting skills, Bloo discovers a horrible secret!  As a student journalist, this episode really left me laughing.  Bloo is quite possibly the best reporter ever.  Not an ethical one, but still...
--Frankie: ""Sounds to me like someone's jealous!""
--Bloo: ""Not jealous, journalis...t.""

""My So-Called Wife"" - 3/5 - While Mr. Herriman and Coco try to impress an eccentric billionaire in order to get funds for the house, Frankie and Mac try to teach Bloo the fine art of sarcasm.  They don't fare well...

2856490,4,B000R17RTY,"""Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends"" was an inspired cartoon series from Cartoon Network.  This 2-disc DVD set is the complete season 2.  Like all TV shows it has both good and mediocre episodes.  Fortunately the good ones here outnumber the mediocre ones.  I won't go into details about the episodes or characters because other reviews cover those very well.  On the whole I enjoyed watching all of it except for the commentary by the character ""Cheese"" - he got annoying really quickly - they should have paired him with another character for the commentary.  But, I realize, this is a minor gripe.  Those who have not seen or are familiar with the story of Foster's and it's inhabitants will want to buy season 1 first.  I doubt that anyone looking at the page for season 2 wouldn't have season 1 but I felt the need to say that.  The documentation is good and the disc menus are easy to navigate and entertaining in their own right.  This is a good DVD set for both children and adults.",1289952000,,991,4.548022598870056

2856503,5,B000R17RTY,"...enjoying the artistic efforts of creative people.

This show is easily one of the most entertaining and thoughtful, humorous and family-friendly animated series out there. I rarely watch TV (except the daily ritual of Sesame Street with my 2 year old daughter) - but Foster's is a series that I enjoy probably even more than my child does!

I also own Season 1 and it seems the writing has improved a bit with season 2. Also, the creators continue to churn out interesting and unique new characters with each episode. I only hope Cartoon Network plans to release Seasons 3-6 on DVD soon since I am unable to regularly watch the show on cable!

This series is definitely a must-own for me - particularly since I am in the animation business. My only complaint is the lack of extra content on the DVD's... I would LOVE to hear the artists and producers commentary track on all or ANY of the episodes. As it is - the only commentary is a ""fake"" dialog between a couple of the voice actors available on only one episode... it's entertaining but not as insightfull as I would have hoped.",1223769600,,1085,4.553846153846154

I used it for a Sunday school lesson for 3rd through fifth grade boys in how to deal with other kids who drive you nuts. By far, the best line is after Bloo and Cheese have had their argument about what to paint on the go cart. Mac wants flames; Cheese wants bunnies. The scene shows Bloo and Mac pushing the cart,frowning.  Bloo is muttering; the cart is covered in blobs of pink with orange rear ends.  Mac says, ""Shut up.  At least the bunnies are on fire.""

The show uses a fun visual style and adept writing to fill the show with many great chuckling moments, some gut-busting laughs, and a few subtle moments of brilliant satire.

Personally I find Vol. 2 funnier than Vol. 1, not burdened with having to establish the story, but the first season gives a more solid understanding of the Foster's world.

The concept is excellent (a home for imaginary friends whose ""creators"" have grown up) and the characters are entertaining and endearing. I bought the first season on DVD and pre-ordered this one.

The second season DVDs are set-up pretty much the same as the first season. You can choose to ""play all"" or each episode individually. They include the intro with the theme song for each episode, but you can easily skip it using the chapter forward button on your DVD player (the same with the end credits for each episode). I love the first season, but I enjoy the second season even more, partially because of the introduction of a new character, Cheese. While some may find this character irritating, I find him to be annoyingly funny, especially in the first episode he appears in (might be my favorite episode). I have to say that Eduardo is my absolute favorite character, but Cheese comes in a close second.

For those of you who think it's just for kids, give it a try. They have references to pop-culture (past and present) that adults should find funny and the show is just plain fun to watch! I will definitely be purchasing season 3 in the near future.",1191888000,,1252,4.660633484162896
