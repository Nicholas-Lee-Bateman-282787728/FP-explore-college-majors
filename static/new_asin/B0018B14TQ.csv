8501066,3,B0018B14TQ,"While this is an excellent film for those who enjoy bizarrely idiosyncratic Hong Kong horror films, the DVD that is being sold here isn't all to great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, this is a DVD-R and is therefore more likely to last a shorter period of time when compared to regular discs. The film is presented in a letterbox format, and is NOT in anthropomorphic widescreen like the cover claims. It would seem that the source for this DVD is a VHS tape, as the picture is somewhat soft. Japanese subtitles are burned into the right side of the screen and the spoken language is the English dub. The audio is passable, sometimes jumping around at random points. But it is in sync for the entirety of the film, which is more than I can say for several more ""professional"" releases of obscure Asian films. There are no extras aside from a completely unrelated short film that I have no interest in and have never watched. In short, its watchable, and is probably the best we're going to get for this film.",1392422400,2,1013,4.540983606557377

1 star to DVD release! :(((",1216857600,10,202,4.315789473684211
