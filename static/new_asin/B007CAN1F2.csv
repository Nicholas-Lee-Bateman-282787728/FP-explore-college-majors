8514431,4,B007CAN1F2,"Two Imperial Jade Seals must be delivered to Prince Kang of Sung to elevate him to emperor. His brother, the current emperor, and his father, send a couple of patriots, Jing and Meng, on a dangerous mission delivering these seals to validate Prince Kang's legitimate rise to become the emperor of the Sung dynasty. Jing and Meng are attacked as they leave to fulfill their mission, barely make it home alive from their battle wounds. While recuperating, Meng sends his daughter to check on Jing's condition. While there visiting, Jing gives his two disciples of the Joint-hands style sword each a bundle to deliver in his place to the prince. They join with Meng's daughter to continue the mission originally given to Jing and Meng.
Meanwhile, Fengyun Hall wants to intercept and steal the seals for themselves. They eliminate Meng, torture Jing to find out where to find the seals. Once they have one seal in their possession, a plot is initiated to retrieve the second to prevent Prince Kang from becoming the next emperor of Sung. They want all the power.  The story is interesting, characters are well portrayed. It is easy to tell good guys from bad guys. I would not recommend for young viewers as it contains brief nudity and sexual inferences. It was indeed entertaining.  VCD format only plays on all region formated dvd players.  Displays in panoramic format. Previews of other titles in the Shaw Brothers releases at the very beginning prior to start of movie. Remastered from original release from Celestial Pictures.
If you enjoy the swordplay titles from Shaw Brothers, this is another one of the best they have to offer.",1337385600,,1635,4.874100719424461
