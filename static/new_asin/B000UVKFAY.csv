8215105,5,B000UVKFAY,"Ippo Makunouchi is a timid teen with no friends and is constantly bullied by bigger guys. One afternoon he's being beaten by his usual bullies until he's rescued by up and coming boxer Takamura. He later takes Ippo to the gym to recover, and from there Ippo finds his passion in the sport of boxing. -summary

Shonen anime featuring characters fighting for whatever reasons has been a dime a dozen for as long as I can remember. I am a fan of these types of shows, but even I'll admit that they have grown quite stale over the years with so many of them borrowing heavily from Dragonball Z. Fortunately, every once in a while something would show up with so much more to offer than just the next fight. Fighting Spirit aka Hajime No Ippo is one of those shows, and it has actually been my favorite anime of this type for several years.  The show is based on the manga by George Morikawa and directed by Satoshi Nishimura. This collection contains the first part of the series, episodes 1 - 40 and clocks in at 920 minutes.

This is one of those anime titles with so many positive things to say, that it's kind of difficult to know where to start. I'll mention first that the story is definitely among its strongest features. The writing team did quite a bit of research on the art of boxing. They not only tend to focus on the next fight, but also all of the struggles a boxer will have to go through in their training regimen preparing for a fight. There are some grueling moments such as following characters as they spar,  run or jog, and even diet to make weight.

There is rarely a dull moment to be found, but the story elements would never be as strong if not for the characters. Ippo and the other boxers in his gym end up growing up to become something of a family, and the viewer will get to know them well enough. They do follow some of the standard Shonen anime clichs, but it's really difficult not to like this group. They are really big on horse-play, yet they know when it's time to get down to business.

The comedic moments mainly involve the main characters, and their antics fit very well within the show's style. There's a proper balance going on here for those whom despise that severe clashing of genres. The show really isn't that serious to begin with honestly, therefore there's no serious tone here to really sacrifice. Even the level of violence is pretty tame and does not consist of overly gory sequences.

Since I just mentioned the action in some form; the action sequences are brutal with plenty of hard-hitting blows. I must commend the production team for providing the bone crushing sound effects. The blows have a serious impact behind them that works very well working into the show's atmosphere. Some of these confrontations can feel like a viewer is sitting right at ring side. The head shots, body blows, clashing of gloves, all are done with some meticulous detail. This also flows down into the animation; this is indeed a boxing anime and it tries to ground itself within the realms of reality, but the anime twist creeps up occasionally, delivering some highly entertaining and exaggerated exchanges.  I thought the character designs where creative and done well enough. There is a slight amount of reused cels during combat, however this should be expected since it is boxing. There's only so many ways one can move.

Fighting Spirit clearly isn't without its flaws though. I have often compared this show to Baki the Grappler, which is a mixed martial arts anime. I lean heavily in favor of Fighting Spirit having a better all around story, yet I think Baki handles its character roster a lot better in regards to fighting. Fighting Spirit mainly follows the in-ring struggles of Ippo: all of his strategies, his coaching, and his courage during brutal beatings. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast don't even get this. The guys in his gym; their battles are quickly brushed upon and Ippo's rivals along with future opponents aren't really examined until they fight him. Their matches are clear sailing until they face Ippo too, while Ippo struggles against everyone he comes up against. I feel this is the anime's weakest storytelling point, and Baki the Grappler clearly excels here as you get extremely detailed fight sequences with every character in that anime.  In all fairness, at least one character in Fighting Spirit gets his own solo tale before this season ends, but I always wanted to see the others struggle as much as Ippo.

Overall, Fighting Spirit is still an awesome anime that I'm glad to keep around. The action is great, animation is very good, and I love this group of characters. The English dub which I enjoy a lot is well done, and I love the opening theme Inner Light by Shining Lemon the best; it's very energetic and hard-hitting like the battles. I highly recommend this title to anyone whom loves action anime.

Pros: Wonderful feel good story, interesting characters, great action, and very good animation

Cons: Some minor writing issues",1428192000,,5016,4.673469387755102
8215106,5,B000UVKFAY,"I actually found out about Hajime no Ippo:THE FIGHTING(Fighting Spirit in the states) from the unlikeliest of sources:Street Fighter III.In the games,British boxer Dudley uses moves like the Corkscrew Blow(Heart Break Shot),Rolling Thunder(Dempsey Roll) and Cross Counter from the show. Naturally because he's one of my favourite characters,I decided to investigate and ended up stumbling towards the series. What makes Ippo so good is that it breaks away from the common anime premise of people with super powers but instead Jyoji ""George"" Morikawa, the show's creator puts you in the shoes of a kid named Ippo Makunouchi, a kindhearted high schooler who was constantly bullied until he gets rescued by Takamura, a middleweight boxer who introduced him to the world of boxing. Guided by the recurring question ""what does it mean to be strong?"",Ippo literally takes his ""first step"" which is what the title literally means to become a new person through boxing. What's also uncanny is that overtime you'll start learning not only about boxing but also about the characters and their reasons to put on the gloves. The battles add a modicum of drama and action to the story and are filled with moments that will probably want to make you rewind back. I dare say that I enjoy this a tad bit more than the Rocky movies. Hajime no Ippo isn't going to be a ultra popular staple like Naruto, Bleach,or Dragon Ball Z but it is a great story in its own right. If you're curious about boxing(like me) or just want to watch something different, then I highly recommend checking out this anime. You will not regret it.",1295913600,,1606,4.886446886446887
8215107,5,B000UVKFAY,"Got to be one of the top 5 animes ever made. I include Full Metal Alchemist, Last Exile, and Cowboy Bebop in that list btw. It's a exciting, interesting journey with a young, unassertive teen who learns to love boxing - not so he can beat up people, but for its own sake. As the series progresses, it actually teaches boxing- you learn it along with our hero.
The story of his journey up the boxing ladder is really well done- every character has good depth and believability. The fight animation is always good, with a couple of occasional dips to save the budget. But they always put in the real quality wherever they can - very well done imho.

The only thing to watch out for is some male locker-room horseplay and some high-teen-level pranks and adult references - for instance, one of the more outgoing characters enjoys embarrassing him in rude ways, one time even pantsing him in front of women.

All in all, a seriously great series from the some of the prime people who brought you the Trigun series. The music is from the same people, and it's even better imho.

p.s. I can't comment on the English dubbing, but the Japanese voice casting is superb - every character is perfect.",1210291200,3,1189,4.52093023255814
8215108,5,B000UVKFAY,"This anime is based on a simple concept, Ippo Makunouchi is a high school student who gets bullied all the time and when he finds boxing his world is turned upside down. Ippo puts such dedication in first being accepted to the gym, and then developing his skills as a boxer, that the story has to be labeled as inspiring. But even though that story on paper is straightforward and maybe even a little clich&eacute;, there are many elements that make this product something special.

I really like the way in which Morikawa (the creator of the manga) crafted the character of Ippo, since he is extremely polite, respects his opponents, is always humble and does not seek revenge. Another big plus for this series is the humor, in which Takamura plays a big role. This boxer, who is aiming to get the world title, is the one that ""discovered"" Ippo's talent, and he is the perfect antidote for dullness. His pranks are outstanding, and always end up with Ippo in an awkward situation.

At times, there is a slight hint of the story getting repetitive. As you can imagine, following the story of an underdog for forty episodes, as he climbs his way through the ranks may get a little old. However, the particularities of each opponent, and the fact that we get to know a little bit about their lives and what drives them to fight, keep the interest level high. The fact that even those characters that look evil, have redeeming qualities and attitudes that are understandable, makes this anime even better. Finally, there is an element of romance that lightens the mood when needed.

Through the episodes, viewers will get to know all the wonderful characters in the series and look forward to their reappearance. Each of these have a very special story, and some take a pretty prominent role, like Miyata, a talented boxer admired by Ippo, but who is also one of his biggest rivals. You will also get to see a myriad of special weapons, like the counter, the smash, the flicker jab, and the shotgun.

The series counts with crisp and detailed graphics and the action scenes are animated in a special and creative way. The use of distorted faces in relation to humorous and romantic scenes, also works very well. On a different note, the music used in the beginning and ending credits is outstanding. Finally, I liked the way in which in the last two episodes of this set, the focus of the story changed a little from Ippo to another character, because it leaves us wondering what will come next. Anyone looking for a sport's anime should start here; the only problem is that it will set the bar too high for any other anime in the future. Trust me, I talk from experience.",1195257600,15,2669,4.612631578947369
