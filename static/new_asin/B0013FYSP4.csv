8326427,5,B0013FYSP4,"I chose this rating because I've seen the film a number of times, and am collecting my favourite films. This film is a favourite because good triumphs over bad in respect of both the natives, their land and their spirituality and culture is preserved. It is a feel good movie for me because of the spiritual and environmental elements, anyone who has an interest in the spiritual diversity and cultural differences of others will I think enjoy this film. It may to some extent be for a younger audience, but I feel that people of any age will enjoy it. There is the elements of mystery, thrill, danger, spirits, and romance - in my opinion a good all rounder, and the baddies lose! :)",1357948800,3,684,4.524193548387097
