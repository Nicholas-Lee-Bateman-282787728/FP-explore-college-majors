2337028,3,B0009Y2LS6,"This movie is largely set in London ,but no location shooting was involved ,the city being wholly recreated(in black and white) on the Columbia Studio backlot .This gives the movie a slighly stagebound feel to it which slightly weakens its impact
Kim Novak plays the title role -a woman suspected of having killed her husband .The police problem is that they cannot produce a body as the spouse in question has simply vanished .She is shunned by most of her neighbours apart from one wheelchair bound woman who thinks it all good fun having a scandal to liven up the area
Jack Lemonn plays a newly arrived US diplomat who unsuspectingly rents an apartment in her large and  spacious Mayfair residence and the two gradually fall in love ,to the evident consternation of his boss at the US Embassy -Fred Astaire. He is presured by the seemingly avuncular policeman in charge of the case (Lionel Jeffries )to spy on her and unearth evidence of her complicity in the death of the husband. Only problem is -he is not dead and when he turns up she is forced to shoot him for real in self-defence .Cue a finale involving a trial ,a false witness,blackmail and a cliffhanger of an ending

Uniformly well acted and blessed with a sharp script from director Richard Quine this should be revived a lot more than it is and it is a good ,sharp little movie with a few neat red herrings to keep audiences on their toes .Keep your eyes out for nice cameo roles from Henry Daniell and Estelle Winwood",1198627200,,1484,4.575187969924812

2337030,5,B0009Y2LS6,"Director Richard Quine, along with writer Larry Gelbart, created this wonderfully sly, campy film, one of the best  and most well-reviewed comedies of 1962. Columbia Pictures' big success that year was ""Lawrence of Arabia"", so this one was somewhat relegated to the back burner, then forgotten. A shame, because it's really one of Kim Novak's better performances, and features a fun comic performance by the great Jack Lemmon. Fred Astaire is along for the ride, and having fun in a relatively small role. As in all of Quine's films, the most fun comes from supporting characters, namely Lionel Jeffries & Estelle Winwood. I won't blab away the plot, since many of you likely haven't seen this film, but it's a murder-mystery, very clever with loads of laffs. I thought that, by now, someone would've come up with a retropective of Lemmon's career; if anyone gets that idea, ""The Notorious Landlady"" should be near the top of the list, regarding his comedies (which he did with the same aplomb as his riveting dramas; this was the same year as ""Days of Wine & Roses""). I love and admire the career of Mr. Lemmon, a true American original; his role here as an American dealing with culture clash in England adds to my admiration. PLEASE...

2337047,3,B0009Y2LS6,"TNL is a handsomely mounted, amiable enough early Sixties movie, but it ultimately doesn't quite compel in the way it should. Maybe the basic problem is the variable chemistry between Jack Lemmon and Kim Novak. But probably even more central is that the film can't quite make up its mind on whether it wants to be a romantic comedy or straight murder mystery, and admittedly it's a tough balancing act to do right. I suppose Hitchcock was most successful in pulling off this tricky combination. And, alas, Fred Astaire seems wasted as a diplomatic bureaucrat who's always chastising Lemmon for his indiscretions.
Pluses include George Duning's lushly romantic score, the quirky British supporting cast, and those fog-laden London locales. And Kim Novak is incredibly ravishing even by her standards. A reluctant three stars instead of four.",1423440000,2,840,5.1838235294117645

2337065,5,B0009Y2LS6,"Jack Lemmon plays an American diplomat, Bill Gridley,  attached to the embassy in England. On his first day in London he rents a flat from a very attractive new landlady, Carly Hardwicke played by Kim Novak. But unknown to him his new landlady has a ""reputation"" but for what. The dialogue sparkles from Lemmon's comment to Carly's query. you don't seem to harbor any prejudices to which Lemmon responds. no, after all he is a Democrat from Massachusetts.  And from the get-go it's clear Gridley is attracted to Carly but is she single, married, divorced.

On Gridley's second day he is grilled by his station chief Frank Ambruster, Fred Astaire, who informs him that his landlady murdered her husband. Suddenly Gridley finds himself recruited by Scotland Yard Inspector Oliphant, Lionel Jeffries, to ""investigate"" Mrs. Hardwicke to see if he can either prove her guilty or innocent. Of course Gridley leaps to Carly's defense especially after Oliphant's hysterical explanation of how women make not only loving wives but exceptional killers.

Ambruster orders Gridley to cooperate and yet after he meets her and is smitten; he agrees that she is innocent. The film is filled with red herrings from titles of bedside reading to misunderstood phone calls that only enrich the comedy and the mystery. Lemmon is great as the would be lover who vacillates between loyalty and suspicion.

I hadn't seen this film since its release in 1962 and was happy to find a DVD available on Amazon but this film is a classic and deserves an updated release.",1395792000,2,1541,4.957364341085271

I think it is the third time that he starred with Kim Novak (Phfft, then Bell, Book and Candle, and this movie) and as much as I love both performers, the movie does slow down a little in the middle.  Thank goodness for Fred Astaire who as Lemmon's boss at the State Dept. in London brings class and elegance to this flick.  Buy it and have a good time, especially if you are a Jack Lemmon fan.

He and Kim provide some romantic sparks while incorporating humor and suspicion at the same time.  The resolution to the ""murder"" doesn't take place until near the end of the movie so it is natural to keep guessing as to what kind of an ending will ensue.
Fred Astaire plays a completely straight role (no singing or dancing) and that takes a bit of getting used to but he carries it off pretty well as an American diplomat.",1389398400,,566,4.696969696969697

2337070,5,B0009Y2LS6,"Simply my favorite mock-Gothic movie! Filmed in glorious black and white the moody, foggy London atmosphere is the perfect setting for this suspenseful and hilarious thriller. Jack Lemmon has been assigned to the London office of the State Department under stuffy boss Fred Astaire. He rents an apartment in a house owned by gorgeous Kim Novak not realizing that she is notoriously under suspicion for murdering her husband, whose body has disappeared. He falls immediately in love with her in spite of the mysterious events, her organ-playing in the middle of the night, the locked closet in his flat - and Astaire's horror when he finds out where Lemmon is living.

This is bang up fun, very lively, and so well cast and directed that I can't say enough good about it. It also has the funniest chase scene at the very end of any movie ever made. If you haven't yet seen this film I envy you your first look. Enjoy!",1386460800,,916,4.654320987654321

2337084,3,B0009Y2LS6,"I saw ""The Notorious Landlady"" as a first run movie when I was younger and less critical; my re-acquaintance has left me disappointed. Time has not been kind to this sort of movie, it's a leftover from the studio system where it was presumed that assembling all the right elements would result in ""box office"", but this film has too many elements. It can't decide whether to be a romantic comedy or a Hitchcock thriller. Kim Novak is beautiful, Jack Lemmon is funny, the script is witty but dated: Was extramarital sex really that shocking? Even in 1962 I suspect the whole thing just didn't coagulate, nobody cared. It's like reading an advice column from a 60 year old woman's magazine and wondering, ""Did they really think that would work?"" Novak has a nice dramatic scene with her ""dead"" husband that never-the-less seems sewn in like a patch. Perhaps the best part, and worth slogging through the rest, is the chase scene at the end, daffy and superb, with music by Gilbert and Sullivan and Estelle Winwood in a runaway wheelchair. There is some nostalgia value. If you are interested in the early '60's then this is a good movie for you; It captures the period perfectly.",1374796800,,1177,4.690821256038648
2337085,5,B0009Y2LS6,"Back in the sixties I picked up the novelization by Irving Shulman, and read it several times. It wasn't till years later that I actually saw the movie, and the performances by Lemmon and Kim Novak quickly made this one of my favorite comic mysteries. I also enjoyed Lionel Jeffries as the Scotland Yard detective. I'm not sure how Fred Astaire ended up in this film, but he always seemed to me a trifle miscast as Lemmon's superior, but he nevertheless turns in an enjoyable performance. I always get a kick out of the breakneck finish to the rousing strains of Sir Arthur Sullivan.

HOWEVER, I have twice ordered used copies, and both times, although the cover and the DVD itself say ""The Notorious Landlady,"" the movie is ""Phffft,"" a one-star movie about a divorcing couple.  Clearly the studio mislabeled a bunch of them.

The script (even though the usually worthwhile Blake Edwards is given a credit in the screenwriting) is bereft of wit or sparkle, the ""situation"" around which the story is built is simply uninteresting and no amount of creeping up on it can make it more interesting. The directorial touch is leaden and that, perhaps more than anything, is the reason why I just could not watch it to the end. I was dozing off and my partner was already asleep by the time I reached for the remote control. Rarely have I been unable to watch a film to its conclusion.

2337107,5,B0009Y2LS6,"No comment on the quality of the disc since I watched on equipment hardly designed to reflect contemporary expectations. The film  dates from a time when we were trying to get accustomed to a Fred Astaire film without singing or dancing; it must have also have been one of the early Blake Edwards scripts, as well. Add in Jack Lemmon that fine comic actor and Kim Novak, that fine looking woman, and you have a delicious stew. There is a certain piquancy to the story-line which maintains our interest, a woman with a husband who simply vanished,  her tenant, a diplomat newly arrived in the country- on his best behavior to hold his job at the American Embassy, and his boss who wants no trouble. Most of the fun comes, however, from Lemmon,  for whom the other two are second bananas against whom he bounces his often physical but usually funny, responses. Looking at the film now, I am somewhat surprised to see how well Astaire handles the switch from song and dance man to straight actor.
All-in-all, this film which I enjoyed so much 45 years ago still has plenty to offer. In that sense, it is timeless fun.",1255824000,9,1114,4.56

The new American in town wants to rent a flat, that's all he wants, until he sees the landlady, then things get hot (scorching heat), he nearly burns the house down.
With his position at the embassy at stake, the Yankee plays detective for Scotland Yard in order to help solve the mystery of the missing husband.
Too bad his landlady is such a sexy knockout!

It is unwatchable and unlistenable.
I waited ten years (ever since I bought my first DVD) hoping sooner or later the production company would publish a remastered version of this film, starring Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon (at the peak of their careers) and Fred Astaire, but to no avail.
For some obscure reason they don't seem interested, so the only way to finally see it, after the first time at the theatre, 46 years ago, was to buy this copy, by Hollywood's Attic...
Nothing wrong with that, but the problem is that whoever mastered this version had serious problems with his declining eyesight, since the black and white images are so blindingly brilliant and lacking contrast that I had to reduce brightness on my Sony Bravia TV to 0 (zero) to watch it!!!
Of course, this didn't help in any way the dirt, scratches and assorted defects of the copy used for mastering the DVD.
Audio quality is on a par with video quality, that is, horrible.
At times, especially at the start, when Ms. Novak attempts a fake-sounding British accent, you have to strain your ears to try and catch the words.
A real pity, because even after all these years, the film is still very funny, romantic and pleasing, thanks to the beauty of Kim Novak, the acting skills of Jack Lemmon and the sophisticated humour of the master of modern slapstick comedy, Blake Edwards, who wrote the script and fine direction by Richard Quine (Bell, Book and Candle).
Extras and subtitles are totally absent and the screen is slightly cut at the sides, like a partial pan and scan.

2337110,4,B0009Y2LS6,"I saw The Notorius Landlady for the first time December 2008. It's a breezy,even-paced,smart little funny film with Fred Astaire,Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon,  and a host of English stars comprising a wonderful cast. The film takes place in England. It begins like a Hitchcock film with people going about their business when a shot rings out  in a house,and next we see a body being dragged into a garage and a car with the body  in it emerges and  speeds away. The main protagonists are Kim Novak as a landlady(zingingly gorgeous throughout the movie) who is suspected of killing her husband,but no body can be found;Jack Lemmon as a State Department lackey and sometimes angstful bumbler(as some of his roles were) who immediately falls in love with the landlady; and Fred Astaire as the State Department boss(straight actor,sans dancing.)The film then proceeds to establish a quickly developed romantic relationship  between Kim and Jack although he is warned by his boss  not to get involved with her because of her reputation as a suspected murderer. Then the film develops an air of mystery with weird organ music in the house at night,suspicious meetings in the London Fog,pesky neighbors who peer through windows and over balconies,listen, and spy on the couple's every movement within the rooms/house that Kim has rented to Jack,Scotland yard visiting the State department,creepy noises in the house,strange notes under the door and all kinds of twist and turns in the plot that will keep you guessing about what's going on and how things will turn out. Blake Edwards wrote the script and you kind  of  get a sense of what will come later in his PINK PANTHER films because slapstick is embedded throughout and  appears unexpectedly amidst moments that should be suspenseful or as people try to solve the murder. The film kept my interest because I am a big fan of all three stars. Novak is delightful throughout to watch as she has to express a wide gamut of emotions. Lemmon is a bit cloying as a romantic lead. He is better when he plays it straight. Fred Astaire dresses classy and and acts classy with some funny moments for him thrown in. Overall I like the film.
