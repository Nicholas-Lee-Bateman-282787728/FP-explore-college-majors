2865771,4,B000RFQQ7O,"In the deepest, real, and visceral sense, Resolution is a horror movie. Its primary tool is not only the psychological mind game Justin Benson puts his characters through (i.e. misguided friendship, drug addiction, violence, and the mystery of whose watching) but what he also forces the audience to realize as they watch them spiral out of control. Resolution not only breaks the third wall, it decimates it. We become the monster just by sitting there and watching. If that's not enough to wrap your head around then you have to see it to really get to really get mind screwed. ~ the Creepercast",1379980800,7,597,4.805825242718447
2865772,5,B000RFQQ7O,"Sick of cheap knock-offs and lame by-the-numbers Hollywood horror? Resolution delivers something entirely new and surprising. It is original, both tense AND funny, and simply not to be missed! It is thought provoking and not for the lazy, though - trust me, you will want to watch it again immediately. This is the best film of 2012/2013 that you haven't heard of! But soon everyone will be buzzing about directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson as they are the real deal and you will want to keep an eye on them! Seriously, see this movie!!!",1379376000,11,544,4.7368421052631575
2865773,2,B000RFQQ7O,The plot is slow and the acting so-so. Sam Jenkins Sorbo is a good actress but limited by a dumb plot. A waste of her talent. Other characters are so shallow it is pathetic (especially the villian).,1207699200,,198,4.378378378378378
2865774,3,B000RFQQ7O,"Michael (Peter Cilella) heads out to a reservation to save his friend Chris (Vinny Curran) get clean.  When Chris refuses to go to rehab, Michael handcuffs his friend to the wall.  However, while examining the property, Michael discovers some old photos and film.  It feels like someone is playing a game with them.  Could it be the reservation security personnel, who had no idea Chris was squatting?  Could it be the junkies, whom Chris owes money?  Or could it be something else, something a little more supernatural?

RESOLUTION has its flaws.  It never truly makes much sense, which is perhaps the most unforgivable Indie horror sin.  The plot feels stretched out; this is a 90 minute film that could've been 75 or so, easily.  However, despite these (admittedly critical) faults, RESOLUTION has an absolutely fantastic atmosphere; things never feel very safe, as though at any second the whole world could be knocked out of whack.  And the lead actors have outstanding chemistry; their friendship keeps the film going, even when things (maybe?) begin spiraling out of hand.  I can't recommend RESOLUTION to everyone, because it certainly doesn't appeal to mass audiences.  But for those who like horror films that stick around a while, that go for more atmospheric scares as opposed to jump scares, then this one is at least worth a shot.",1411862400,,1344,4.973094170403588
2865775,1,B000RFQQ7O,"I heard great reviews and cooments about this fim on Amazon and similar sites. I also noticed that it had a great score on Rotten Tomatoes, that is why I decided to check it out. Like many other recent horror/suspense ventures that have recieved great reviews; In Fear, Cheap Thrills, the film ultimately fails to live up to it's premise and ultimatley fails to deliver any suspense, interesting story turns, etc... I am not going to go into the premise of the film, you should have an idead about that by now if you are reading this review, however, I will say save yourself the 80 minutes and go checkout some of the recent Shout factory releases if you want a true horror/suspense film. Also, I tend not to notice language as much in most films, however, I would say that I did in this film, it seems absolutely pointless and out of place. The movie is so boring you may find yourself seeing if you can count how many times the supporting character can say F%^&$%&%^. Find another film!",1405382400,4,989,4.5
2865776,2,B000RFQQ7O,"I can't say I liked this film or saw much of a point. The preview looked great and made it seem like a ""Cabin In The Woods"" meets ""Close Encounters"" (or ""Fire In The Sky""). Was movie Creepy? Yes. But it was irritating too. Plot: Someone sends a guy video of his loser drug addict friend going ""mental"" in the woods and he goes to ""rescue"" him by trying to take him to rehab. No go. Addict refuses. So friend handcuffs addict to a wall in a shoddy cabin addict is living in. Native Americans arrive claiming house is their property. More loser druggies that addict and friend know from High School come to collect on drug debt and threaten addict and buddy. Dog friend of addict drops by to ""work"" on book she and addict are ""writing"" about squirrels (Delusion by addict). Weird photos, old books, film loops, and recordings appear. I didn't care. Strange ending that was to be profound or bizarre or funny(?). I felt relief that something came along and movie ended, putting the two leads out of MY misery! TRUELY a total waste of my time, the efforts of talented actors, and of film.",1403740800,2,1084,4.452261306532663
2865777,4,B000RFQQ7O,"A deeply oddball, and pretty entertaining low budget mash-up of character study, humor, and metaphysical horror.  Its not like anything youve seen before, but it achieves that effect by taking a LOT of elements youve seen before, and having fun combining them in novel ways.

A young guy  - Michael - who seems to have his life pretty together goes out to try and save his depressed, meth-head, gun loving friend  Chris  who is living alone in the middle of the woods.  The unanswered question of who took the video of this Chris acting so crazy sets the tone for this film full of unexplained weirdness that creates a generally tense and creepy atmosphere despite any clear resolution to many of the questions (that's only one of several meanings the pun-laden title seems to have).

Much of the film is the relationship between these two men, and how Chris reacts to being forced to go cold turkey after Michael handcuffs him to a wall pipe.  Both the acting and dialogue wavers between fun, honest, touching and a touch amateurish.  Chris has one of the easier, least believable sudden withdrawals from serious addition I can remember seeing on film.  But this film doesnt seem too worried about being real.  It seems far more interested in being entertaining and leaving you wondering just what things mean; that old, creepy photo, the escapee from a local loony bin who knocks on the window at night, the fact that they are on Indian lands with a bad history.  Do these things mean anything?  Or do we just assume they do from a lifetime of horror and suspense films?  The film-makers aren't always saying, they want us to wonder for ourselves and to smile while we shiver just a bit.  Ill be curious to watch this again.  It seems like a repeat viewing will either reveal its shallowness or uncover hidden depths",1397347200,5,1818,4.687697160883281
2865778,5,B000RFQQ7O,"Resolution is a film that is best watched without expectation. It's a genre bending film and that will make some viewers dislike it. It bills itself as horror/thriller but really it's more of a comedy/buddy film with a little mystery/drama thrown into the mix.

The plot is simple:
Michael lives in the city and has lost contact with his friend Chris. One day Michael receives a video of Chris, which shows him sitting out in the country side and doing crystal meth all day... and shooting guns. Michael assumes that Chris sent the video and it is a cry for help. Michael goes to his friend Chris and handcuffs him to the wall, in hopes that he will get clean for good. Michael takes walks each day and finds himself gradually involved in a local mystery that may prove more than he and Chris can handle.

I really enjoyed Resolution because everything comes off as very genuine. You can tell that the cast had fun making it and everyone from the directors to the actors really sell it. I actually got lost in these characters and the mystery that they are involved in and never once was bored or was my mind wandering. I loved how casual and disarming the film was when it's just Michael and Chris together, and I like the contrast between those and some of the more eerie scenes.

For those that enjoy stuff in the realm of Twin Peaks, this is for you. I'm not saying that as a comparison, but more as an indication of the flavour and atmosphere of the film.",1391990400,7,1460,4.440298507462686
2865779,1,B000RFQQ7O,"Nine Things About ""Resolution""

1. I didn't know much about this film before I watched it, I just knew that it was getting good reviews as an indie thriller.

2. This is one of those ""polarizing"" movies that you will either really like or really not like.  I really didn't like it.

3. It's about a guy, Mike, that goes to visit Chris, his crack-addicted best friend, who is staying out in the country. Mike handcuffs Chris in his cabin and vows to stay with him for a week until he can get off the crack.

4. While they are staying in the house, they are visited by a bunch of random characters that live in the area.  They also start getting even more random clues that some strange being is watching them and filming them. They slowly discover they are in real danger.

5. I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Characters float in for a scene and then are never seen again. Instead of being mysterious, the movie is disconnected and nonsensical.

6. The directors admit that they have no direct experience with crack addiction or withdrawal. They just Googled it. This is extremely obvious. Chris the crack addict doesn't really seem to be very uncomfortable in his withdrawal. It's the worst portrayal of a drug addict I've ever seen. He is really just the comic relief in the film.

7. The crack withdrawal plot really has nothing to do with the real story. The directors added it to the script to give it ""structure"". Which means they needed to make it longer. This is a decent 30-minute film that was artificially stretched to last 90 minutes, so the whole point of the movie drowns in it's own ""mysteriousness"".

8. In what should have been the most suspenseful scene towards the end, the two guys suddenly take a break to discuss their friendship and how awesome each other is.

9. The ending is one of the dumbest and most frustrating endings in recent memory.",1389225600,3,1905,4.54093567251462
2865780,5,B000RFQQ7O,"One of the best movies from 2012, hands down. Original, funny and genuinely creepy.  Would be great side-by-side with Kill List and the Blair Witch Project.",1384214400,8,156,5.0
2865781,1,B000RFQQ7O,"I feel bad saying anything negative towards somewhat novice writers/directors, and their creative thoughts were in the right direction. But, it wasn't clear what the central theme of the story was suppose to be. Too many improbabilities in terms of the actions taken and not taken by our two main characters; too many not clearly presented backstories on what took place at the site. The old tech and new tech modes of communication just seemed hokey and not believable. The ""presence"" (or source) whatever it was is still not clear. Consequently there's just a vague fading ending to the film. The Native res thing was more of a distraction than a significant contributor to the story.",1383955200,8,686,4.922413793103448

8200408,1,B000RFQQ7O,"While it might sound trite, the quest to be unconventional risks missing the forest for the trees. The directors missed the mark on this one!

8200411,5,B000RFQQ7O,I've never seen anything quite like it. I saw the director's later effort (SPRING) before this and went in search of other films. This didn't disappoint.

Also, I don't identify with addictive personalities nor those who try to rescue same.

Don't waste your time, unless you liked the Blair 'tapes'.

BS without good actiing.

8200414,5,B000RFQQ7O,"Mike wants to help his friend Chris kick his crack addiction, so when Chris refuses to go to rehab, Mike handcuffs him to the wall of his cabin, forcing him to go cold turkey. It's well-acted with great dynamic between the two leads. I feel it could've made for a pretty decent drama if the filmmakers had just left it at that. Thankfully, though, because dramas really aren't my cup of tea, there's more to the story. Mike keeps finding weird old photos, books, and films. What's on them and what they're about isn't really clear, but it's creepy nonetheless. Eventually, he finds a video of himself and Chris, taken unknown to them a couple days earlier. That's all I'll say of the plot. Resolution is a fantastic movie, a slow pot-boiler that's well worth a watch for anyone serious about finding good (if not particularly scary) horror movies or just ones that stand out above the typical cheap slop.",1421884800,3,904,4.65625
