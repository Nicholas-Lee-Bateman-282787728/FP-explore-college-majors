7839556,3,6303128645,"The Mummy & The Mummys Curse & The Mummys Ghost

This set contains three horror movies that feature ""The Mummy"", a creature that rises from the dead past to threaten the current living. A 3,700 year old preserved mummy can be brought back to life by the use of a magic potion brewed from ""tanna leaves"". This story echoes the vampire films of ""Dracula"". These films tell about life and its assumptions in 1940s America, as viewed by Hollywood. The 1942 Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a super-agency that controlled wages and prices for the war effort. It restricted Hollywood spending and consumption. Movies were made with lower lighting (""film noir"") to save coal and oil. Background sets were reused whenever possible. Film footage from earlier movies was recycled for lower costs. Note that recurring TV shows avoid the problem of new sets. [Do tanna leaves have a symbolic meaning?]

The Mummy begins with a 1921 British expedition who learn this mummy was a punished man. Treason? Sacrilege? Familiarity with the Vestal Virgins? That long-dead mummy comes to life! There is a story about life from 3,700 years earlier. A princess died. The Scroll of Thoth was stolen, the punishment was to be buried alive. Helen returns. She is not well, she is getting weaker. Medical science is hopeless. But they have a plan; Helen is saved to live with Frank.

""The Mummy's Curse"" takes place in the swamps of Louisiana. [What happened to Mapleton, that pleasant New England town?] Klaris is once again sent to rescue Princess Ananka. Will she resist this rescue? [How were they buried in the swamp?] Will swamp water create a miraculous do-over on a muddy mummy? This was the last of the 1940s mummy movies. Wonder why?

""The Mummy's Ghost"" begins with a new high priest; he will travel to Mapleton to reanimate Klaris with tanna leaves so Princess Ananka can be returned for proper burial in Egypt. What will happen when the Princess arrives in the swamp? Will the plans go awry?",1511654400,,1985,4.829411764705882
7839557,5,6303128645,"This set of films is a real treat for horror fans. This is what popcorn was made for. This set includes the original screen classic from 1932 that began our long love affair with the mysteries of archaeology and ancient Egyptian curses which have provided us with countless hours of entertainment over the years as we let our imaginations run free for an hour or two. This is top-notch fun from Universal.

After the initial masterpiece of the original ""A"" film, ""The Mummy,"" Universal would make a franchise of the character and it would become a staple during the 1940's for people looking to escape the harsh news of the war and get lost in a fun story on a Saturday afternoon. It was also a chance to put your arm around your girl, as you knew there would be a few thrills that would give you the excuse you needed.

The two later entries from the 1940's included here are both a lot of fun, and both have Lon Chaney Jr. as the tortured Kharis, forever attempting to reunite with his forbidden love, Ananka.""The Mummy's Ghost"" was excellent ""B"" film entertainment and had John Carradine as Yousef Bay. George Zucco was back as Andoheb, even though he was supposedly killed off in the previous film. Ramsay Ames is the frightened Amina/Ananka in this one and Robert Lowery is her bewildered boyfriend. Chaney elicits sympathy through the bandages somehow as he chases after the screaming Amina, who begins to transform into his love Ananka as the story progresses. The great ""B"" sets of Universal and the transformation of Ramsay Ames' character Amina into Ananka are highlights of a good entry in the series.

Lon Chaney would portray Kharis in the final film of the series also, and this time the stunning Virginia Christine would be his most sought after prize. ""The Mummy's Curse"" was set in the swamps as a group of workers developing the area become frightened when they uncover the resting place of Kharis. The foggy swamps provide an appropriately creepy mood for this good ""B"" entry. Betty Walsh is good as Kay Harding and Peter Coe is Dr. Ilzor Zanard, hiding Kharis in the ruins of a monastery. It is best not to question why or how there is such a place on a hill overlooking the swamps of the bayou or how the coffin of Kharis came to be there. These ""B"" Universal entries were meant to be fun entertainment and nothing more. This one succeeds in that capacity with the foggy atmosphere of the swamps and the gorgeous Virginia Christine. The scene where she rises from the swamps, awoken by the sunlight and covered in mud, gives this one a big lift.

For something on another level, the original ""The Mummy"" is a true film classic. The story will seem familiar to audiences today, but it still has never been done better. This great film from 1932 which introduced moviegoers to a story we still can't get enough of, was both entertainment and art. It has stood the test of time and is as much fun to watch today as it was when in theatres in 1932.

The Mummy is one of the great horror films from the early days of sound pictures. It began as all true film classics do, with an excellent story, this one by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer. It was a mystery and adventure set in the exotic location of Egypt. Add to that a present day romance in a tug of war with an ancient and supernatural love story and you have a true masterpiece of the genre.

The story opens at a dig by the British Museum in 1921 as Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Bryon) and his team uncover an ancient sarcophagus. It becomes clear, however, that there is something quite different and disturbing about the mummy inside. His name was Imhotep, a High Priest, and the sacred spells etched into his coffin meant to make his journey to the afterlife smooth have been scratched out. And rather than being embalmed as was the custom in ancient Egypt, he was buried alive!

A small casket is also found with him that warns of death for anyone opening it. It seems it contains the ancient scrolls of the Egyptian god Isis, the scrolls holding the key to life and death itself. Try as he may, in spite of warnings about the curse and its power from Dr. Muller (Edward van Sloan), Sir Joseph's assistant Ralph (Bramwell Fletcher) not only opens the small casket, but whispers the ancient Egyptian words of the scroll inside, bringing Imhotep back to life. Ralph Norton goes insane and Imhotep disappears.

Eleven years later, in 1932, a new field expedition of the British Museum headed by Frank Whemple, Sir Joseph's son, is led by a tall and stiff Egyptian with hypnotic eyes named Ardeth Bay (Boris Karloff) to the tomb of an ancient princess. There are equally dire markers surrounding her resting place, the seals of Seven Jackels from over 3,700 years prior left as a warning.

A battle of wills ensues for the love of big eyed and beautiful Helen Grosvernor (Zita Johann) between Frank and Ardeth Bay/Imhotep as Imhotep wants to use the scrolls to bring back Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon and give her Helen's soul. Imhotep's spell is poweful, but perhaps not as strong as Frank and Helen's love for each other. And one must not forget how Isis feels about Imhotep's past and present transgressions against ancient things held sacred.

This is old-fashioned fun in every sense of the word. It does not seem creaky at all but is very entertaining, director Karl Freund keeping this Carl Laemmle Jr. production moving along at a nice pace. Karloff, Manners and Zita Johann are especially good in creating a memorable film that began the legend we all have come to know as, The Mummy.

There is a sarcophagus full of fun and entertainment here. These films are what going to the movies is all about. So grab the popcorn and the kids and let your imagination run wild for an hour or two. It's a lot of fun!",1131926400,,5790,4.5899419729206965
7839558,5,6303128645,"Likewise to the other sets given birth by Universal's classic monster collection,the accomplishment of gathering 3 from the 5 mummy films officially released by the company stands as quite an impressively well-planned achievement in reference to the selections placed in the item. The choice of the brilliant original was understandable adding up to details that along the years have set Boris Karloff as the best egyptian nightmare,but the true question is why select the 2 final sequels to the successfull series of films?the answer lies in the wise decisions made by the releaser,in this case but of-course MCA/universal. Jumping into a theory of my own, placing Lon Chaney jr.'s final performances as 2 of the 3 flicks featured in the 3-pack was simply a common lack of assuring sense:Tom Tyler's 'THE MUMMY'S HAND' only demonstrated to the audiences of a sequelistic 1940's,the fact that the original scary character in the 1932 film was not scarily-comparable enough for the upcoming half-bandaged 'monster' set in the first sequel of the series,for truely distinguished reasons involving the violence and menace of 'imhotep's replacement 'kharis'-meaning introductions to a popular character must always be based on first impressions,and in the case of Tyler even though good,but not enough to exceed the mastering of the unstoppable fiend roled out by Chaney,that also enters the structure opening question #2,why not place 1942's 'THE MUMMY'S TOMB'?the logical answer and explanation of-course relies on 'first-impressions' once again that to some extent places the series in a 'raw' decision that isn't of the cast,but of Tyler's departure of the role after it was first seen by audiences and the public was blending into Tyler's face and portrayal,soon to experience a drastic change for matters of the second sequel's production. This all only as a theory of mine,partly explains the components of this great collector's set that stands of the usual high performance it's 'brothers' have(THE CLASSIC MONSTERS COLLECTION,THE CREATURE COLLECTOR'S SET)by supporting good quality and like always my admired vintage. There is simply no reason for not purchasing a great piece like this to form part in your set of unforgettable monster flicks from Universal's unmatchable collection of the early 90's that makes me truely recommend this 3-piece item that stands as a 'gem' in my favorites list. Great quality from each edition with it's appropiately marvelous packaging. 3 words:buy it now!!!",998265600,,2499,5.377551020408164
