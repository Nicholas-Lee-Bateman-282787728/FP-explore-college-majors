643942,4,6303383076,"John's Wayne's depiction of Townsend Harris is typical John Wayne.  The greatness of this movie is the authenticty of Japanese and American cultural differences in the 1850's  when Commador Perry opened Japan to the  West.  Japan's fear of invasion from the West stemmed from the 1600  Jesuit  Missionaries and Western economic exploitation, most evident in  the West's  occupation of China.  Japan was the first country to refuse the  technological invention of the rifle, believing there was no honor in  killing except in hand to hand combat.  When the cannons on Perry's black  ships  necessitated  opening of Japan's shores, internal opposition to  trade with the West errupted. Townsend Harris, by exemplifying such virtues  as self-sacrifice, courage and honesty, was successful in negotiating a  treaty. The Japanese concept of ""On"" or obligation to family or  lord is the backbone of this movie.  Because the good of the nation is  placed above the individual -  the love Okichi and Harris - is the reason  why this movie deserves a 4 star rating.",956966400,23,1056,5.118343195266272

644234,3,6303383076,"Fine example of a 50's Hollywood location epic, filmed by John Huston, who was known for his rugged adventure stories, The African Queen, Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Moby Dick.  This one is a little sub-standard though, with John Wayne starring as the first American diplomat, Townsend Harris, sent to Japan in the 1850's, but who quickly becomes frustrated,  as the local governor does not honor the treaty and attempts to isolate him.  Harris is awarded a professional geisha girl as consort, and most of the movie is a melodrama of opposite manners and culture clashing.  That of course, slows things down.  But in true John Wayne fashion, the Duke livens things up a bit by getting into a fistfight and dramatically burning out the village during a cholera epidemic, which results in him saving most of the peasants. He also must survive an assassination attempt.  Finally, he gets his audience with the shogun and rides to the palace in triumph.  Most likely this effort will only appeal to John Wayne fans, though.",1426204800,,1025,4.85632183908046

He actually helped prevent Japan from suffering the same problems as China. The love story is not historically proven, but Ochici existed though just how is a mystery. While there are some historical inaccuracies (there was no cholera epidemic he saved villagers from) it is still an interesting film. Not a lot of action. Wayne hated working for Houston as there was no firm script, it still works. Also, Sam Jaffe (great actor) was miscast as the interpreter, who was actually a young man who spoke no japanese. He spoke dutch that was then reinterpreted into japanese. This film shows that Wayne did not need action to still be great.",1404518400,,809,4.785714285714286

644288,3,6303383076,"Sadly, this is not a good film. Watchable, but that's all. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. The real story.

This film is indeed based on a true story. By the signature of first American-Japanese treaty in 1854 (Convention of Kanagawa), two Japanese ports were opened for trade with Americans, guaranteed the safety of American sailors wrecked on Japanese coasts and allowed the opening of an American consulate in Shimoda. In 1856 president Pierce send to Japan first such US Consul General, Townsend Harris. After his arrival Harris demanded the courtesies due to an accredited envoy and refused to deliver president's Pierce letter to any one but to the Tokugawa Shogun in Edo. Negotiations lasted 18 months before Harris finally received an audience of the Shogun. Four months later he successfully negotiated the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Harris Treaty of 1858), setting clear rules for trade between the US and Japan. After a succesful five years term Harris returned to the United States in 1861, retired soon after and died in 1878, aged 73.

During his stay in Japan Harris was assisted by Henry Heusken, a young diplomat fluent in Chinese and Japanese (he was only 24 at his arrival in Japan with Harris). Tragically, at the very end of his term of service, he was murdered in January 1861 by a group of anti-foreign extremists from Satsuma province. His diary about the almost five years spend in Japan was conserved and later published by Harris, together with his own diary, as tribute to his loyal collaborator. This film is based on both accounts by Harris and Heusken.

According to a tenacious legend, soon after his arrival Harris received from Japanese authorities a 17-year-old girl named Okichi as a kind of semi-official concubine. Okichi was supposedly later ostracized after Harris departure, eventually committing suicide in 1892. Beginning soon after 1861, the story of Okichi and her ""barbarian"" master was quickly re-told and changed so many times, that it is now all but impossible to find out what is the truth and what is legend. Some sources question even the fact of her existence. Others claim that she was just a maid and that Harris barely saw her, as she worked for him a grand total of three days. Yet elsewhere there is a claim that she was a street orphan Harris adopted. In other sources she was a professional geisha whose contract was purchased by authorities and who was offered to Harris as a welcome gift and an apology after initially very cold reception. Some stories about Harris and Okichi are in fact soft-porn rather than anything else - others try to tell it as a tragedy. Some sources claim, she suicided, other that she didn't. Some say she was ostracized, some say she wasn't, etc, etc. As every year there are new ""developments"" - after all let's never the truth stand in the way of a good story - the truth with capital T will most certainly never more be known...

2. The film and my impressions

The film tells just the story of first 18 months of Harris mission, until the solemn audience with shogun himself at Edo, and therefore doesn't mention Heusken assassination or Okichi's fate after Harris departure. Sadly, for reasons known only to him, director John Huston changed a lot of things as compared with nthe real story. Henry Heusken, who was in real story 24 at his arrival in Japan with Harris, is played here by Sam Jaffe, who was at that moment... 67 years old! I couldn't see any reason in the scenario why it was done.

More seriously, the audience at Edo in 1858 was granted to Harris by Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun, who was at that time 34 years old. But in the film Harris is received by a 12 years old boy and the solemn audience is just an occasion to some jokes and child play! I think that the lack of seriousness of those important final scenes, which were supposed to be the crowning moment for the ""barbarian"" who endured so much to arrive there, was a MAJOR blunder by this renowned director.

John Wayne plays well, as always, but the weak scenario limits him seriously. The relation between Harris and Okichi is completely vague and NEVER explained! Is she his concubine? Is she just a main? Is this a kind of father/daughter relationship? Well, do not expect any answers fromp this film! That is another serious blunder!

Japanese are portrayed in this film in a not very succesful way, as people who do not really act rationally or logically and who follow strange and unreasonable customs. To some extent they are almost portrayed as naive wildlings - and the audience at Edo is sadly one of such moments... The character of Japanese governor Tamura who is the main Japanese contact of Harris is very, very poorly done - even if Japanese actor So Yamamura did all he could. But there is only so much even a good actor can do when the scenario sucks...

The film is slow and lacks most of wit and humor so important in most of John Wayne's films, except for one scene, in which Harris learns that a dwarf knowing jujitsu is a more serious opponent than his huge brother, the sumoka...)))

On another hand, Japanese actress Eiko Ando, selected for this film not only for her beauaty but also her height (Huston didn't want pair the towering ""Duke"" with a girl who would reach barely to his chest) is sweet and lovely. Born in 1934 Eiko Ando is still with us as of September 2013

John Huston certainly messed this film up and he also had a very bad relationship with Wayne to the point that both gentlemen had finally a regular fistfight! But he is not the only one to blame, because the film, once finished, was extremely heavily edited by 20th Century Fox. When Huston saw the edited version he almost dropped dead! He immediately asked for the removal of his name from credits - but unsuccessfully... Huston always claimed since that the final version, re-cut by the studio, didn't resemble his vision at all... Well, maybe - but as the original version is now definitely lost, we will never know for sure...

The film bombed at box office and frankly, I fully understand why.

CONCLUSION: a film watchable, but barely. Recommened only for the hardest John Wayne's fans (guilty Your Honor) or to amateurs of curiosities (ditto). For anybody else it will probably be a disappointing experience.",1379635200,,6323,4.715579710144928

644352,5,6303383076,"Being a ""Japan aficionado,"" I've waited a long time for this title to become available on Blu Ray. It's the story, embellished, of our first diplomat, Townsend Harris, to take up office in the Japan of the Shogunate. His entrance, very much opposed by the Samurai of the time, was gained by the muscle provided by Commodore Perry's fleet of ""Black Ships"" appearing off the coast of Japan in 1853. The Tokugawa Shogunate had effectively ""sealed"" off Japan for approximately 200 years from foreign interactions (save but a small colony of Portuguese restricted to a port in the south). Perry's arrival in ships POWERED BY STEAM, ships that went AGAINST the tides (Japanese boats were restricted to flat bottomed affairs powered by sails), was akin to the arrival of foreigners in space craft. This also was the catalyst of Japan's eventual shedding of the primitive ways and swiftly becoming a modern power ... and the resultant consequences of that swift transformation during the turbulent early 1900s through WWII. Good story, with ""The Duke,"" John Wayne, playing the part of Harris.",1368144000,3,1084,5.027777777777778

I recommended it to my brother and we both watched it.  Both of us have not seen this movie before and we do not have any idea on the accuracy of the main character Townsend Harris in the movie.  All we know is that he was the first Consul General of the United States to Japan.  He negotiated the ""Harris Treaty"" between Japan and the United States which started trade between the two nations.  Going back to the movie, it was very well made and to see the duke in that role was very enlightening.  With the direction by John Huston, there is the familiarity with the other films John Wayne made under his directorship.  I do recommend this movie not as a historical artifact but as one of the movies that personified the quality of the Duke.

These are not bad copies- far from the shameful ""One eyed jacks""- but are not really high definition transfers.
In  a different  order, my orders of ""A Star is born"" 1937, William Wellman, and ""A trip to the moon"" (George Melis) have never arrived after several months.

Of course I was only 12 and age does mellow ones tastes. I just recieved the Brazilian DVD release of the film and enjoyed it with a differant perspective.

To begin with the film is a nice retelling of the story of Townsend Harris, if slim of substance. The reason: this is not the film John Wayne and John Huston set out to make. When Huston presented his self-edited cut to 20th Century Fox they shorten and re-edited the film. Which explains at least two of the voice overs by the Geisha to fill the viewer in as to what transpired between scenes. Also, evident is how in one scene she can't speak a word of English and in the next she is conversing with Harris. Huston wanted his name removed from the final cut and 20th said he had a contract and Directed by John Huston remains. Huston also was attempting to shoot his film like the Japanese directors and so we will never know what his vision really looked like.

As to Wayne yes he seems out of his element, but I think this may also have been partly due to the cutting of the original longer version. Again his relationship with the Geshia is to fast and something is missing. Yes, he also delivers some lines like John Wayne very stilted, but he also seems the perfect fish out of water as an 1858's American finding himself in Feudal Japan and he's in his element when addressing the Shogan.

Overall if you just go with the film and its sudden, too quick ending. Again something has to be missing. I think the viewer will enjoy themselves and isn't that the purpose of film? Also you just may get a little history lesson along the way.",1286236800,,1733,4.326153846153846

The scenes, shot in Japan are just beautiful and the recreation of the Shogun's court wonderful.  Well worth seeing.  Unfortunately the movie has not been released in the USA and this is a foreign copy but it was wonderful and an excellent transfer. Oh yes, it's based on a true story.",1255564800,,387,4.514285714285714

644567,3,6303383076,"I first saw this movie in 1958 just before going to Japan with the US Army. It made quite an impact on me and my expectations of the Japanese. The movie does successfully capture some of the Japanese spirit as I know it. John Wayne, though he has been panned in this role, I think, embodies what may have been an accurate portrayal of the typical well meaning American in a culture he could never understand. Years later, when I happened to be in Shimoda, where the film is set, I found a small Japanese Museum, that commorated the self-sacrifice of the Japanese woman, the lovely Okichi, to her community. It depicts the 'facts' of the movie in a totally differnt light.
This movie really deserves to be put on DVD !!",1075248000,33,718,4.446969696969697

644569,1,6303383076,"This film is unbelievable. A one star recommendation is possible only because zero stars is not available. (maybe it should be five though). The sight of John Wayne stumbling around the Japanese sets makes it one of the funniest Wayne films ever (file under comedy). And he's made quite a few. He's still all over the place, mumbling and slouching like ever. How could they make this? One of the worst movies ever and therefore a must buy.",982022400,3,439,4.641025641025641

7846661,5,6303383076,"Not the usual role for John Wayne, this film broke a lot of ground.  Placing an American into Japan in the 1850s was akin to letting a bull loose in a cathedral.  Modern diplomacy was nowhere in sight, and Townsend Harris had to feel his way through the highly regimented society of 19th century Japan, which had been sealed off by the Shogunate for 200 years.  Directed by John Huston, Wayne may seem at a loss, but the film gave him a chance to play against his usual type.  (It brought echoes of the boardroom scenes in ""Hellfighters'.)  For Wayne fans, this is a must-see as a not-quite regular performance.  Based on historical events, the ending was a bit abrupt; possibly the studio had stepped in and played with the film as shot by Huston.  I have discovered that a lot of people who consider themselves John Wayne fans have never heard of this one - a pity.  This one along with The Conqueror ought to be more widely known.",1493769600,3,933,4.447058823529412
