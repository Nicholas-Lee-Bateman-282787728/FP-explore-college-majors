8386289,5,B0030Y11XI,"At UFC 98, fans that had been waiting for Rashad Evans to get knocked out since TUF 2, finally had a wish come true. Evans was simply outclassed by Lyoto Machida, and got worked over to the point where Machida finally landed just the right punch to knock Evans out cold. It was the first defeat Rashad Evans suffered, and it lost him his UFC Light Heavyweight title. At UFC 94, Thiago Silva walked into the octagon undefeated, prepared for a Co-Main Event that would make him an even bigger contender. The only problem was that his opponent happened to be Lyoto Machida, and Machida knocked out Silva with 1 second left in the first round. Rashad wants to get his belt back, and Thiago wants to knock Rashad out one more time. This is the UFC Main Event for UFC 108!!

The Co-Main Event for UFC 108 features a big mouth with even bigger power in his hands, taking on a kid who really isn't into running his mouth, just submitting people in amazing ways. Paul Daley made his UFC debut at UFC 103 against Martin Kampmann, a formidable opponent to say the least. But Daley made rather quick work of him in the first round, and now has the bright lights at UFC 108. Dustin Hazelett is a master at Brazilian jiu jitsu, and has pulled off some beautiful submissions. Just ask Josh Burkman and Tamdan McCrory what he's really capable of. Time for these 2 to square off!!

On top of the headliner and co-headliner, the UFC welcomes a MMA legend to the octagon in Gilbert Yvel. Is he ready for the latest and greatest in the Heavyweight division, Junior dos Santos? We'll see.

Oh, and because fighters stepped up to replace injured fighters due to multiple injuries, nobody was cut after this UFC.

There are 10 fights on this DVD, and I'll list them all below!

Rafaello Oliveira vs. John Gunderson: This is a fight that is close to a war of attrition, really. Now, this really isn't a boring fight, but I thought more could've been done. All in all, a decent fight that goes to a unanimous decision.

Mike Pyle vs. Jake Ellenberger: Coming off of his first UFC win, Mike Pyle knows he belongs here. Ellenberger comes in with a chip on his shoulder due to his UFC debut split decision loss to Condit. A 2nd round TKO is the result of this scrap!

Mark Munoz vs. Ryan Jensen: Tough wrestler taking on a guy with only one UFC win in a lot of fights, but a lot of scrap in him. This ends with a submission due to strikes in the 1st round!

Cole Miller vs. Dan Lauzon: He made his UFC debut at UFC 64 at only 18, and now Dan Lauzon is back. Cole Miller is ready to give him a rude awakening. This is one of the most beautiful submissions I've seen, and it happens in the 1st round after a lot of action!!

Martin Kampmann vs. Jacob Volkmann: The man called ""Christmas"" hung in there with Paulo Thiago in his UFC debut. Can he hang in there with somebody like Kampmann? This ends with a 1st round submission!

Junior dos Santos vs. Gilbert Yvel: Make no mistake about it, ""The Hurricane"" in Yvel wants the big KO. But so does Junior. And one of them gets that KO in the 1st round!

Jim Miller vs. Duane Ludwig: ""Bang"" is back, hoping for some fireworks, but against a real scrapper where the Miller brothers come to fight!! A 1st round submission ends this one!

Joe Lauzon vs. Sam Stout: If you were like me, you thought you had the winner picked without a second thought. Joe Lauzon has taught the likes of Jens Pulver a thing or two, and he's ripped Jeremy Stephens apart too. But Sam Stout has been in wars with Spencer Fisher, Matt Wiman, and Per Eklund, and he's come out on top against them! This is a dogfight, and an easy FIGHT OF THE NIGHT!! Unanimous decision to the winner!

Dustin Hazelett vs. Paul Daley: Both of these guys came to fight, that was easy to see. But one of them got the 1st round KO!!!

Rashad Evans vs. Thiago Silva: This could've ended with a KO, but dancing the chicken dance isn't going to finish a fight. This was a tough fight for the most part, and a unanimous decision was awarded in the end!",1294099200,,4017,4.33155792276964
8386290,4,B0030Y11XI,"This is a very entertaining card. Only three fights go to the judges; most don't get out of the first round, good mix of knockouts and submissions. Not a lot of big name fighters on the card but a lot of guys who are hungry trying to make their way up the ladder. Can't ask for much more than that. Under rated card; good buy.",1284508800,2,326,4.030769230769231
