8636857,5,B00HWCJFKU,"Love seeing Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmonds,Ian Drury, & the rest of the STIFF Label consortium in those beginning days of Punk Rock. This was before it got watered down by the ""New Wave"" moniker.",1522713600,,204,4.694444444444445
8636858,5,B00HWCJFKU,"It's a CD-R type boot, but very good quality.  Somebody will catch up with it all, so grab it while you can.",1516838400,,108,3.909090909090909
8636859,4,B00HWCJFKU,"This is a fun and entertaining video about some of the British new wave singers and bands of the early 70's.
It shows you each of them both performing and behind the scenes, riding on a tour bus, and elsewhere.",1455667200,,210,4.275
8636860,1,B00HWCJFKU,"I bought this as a gift for my wife, who loves almost all the music that came out of the Stiff Studio back in the day.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!
Most of the dvd consisted of unintelligible banter and babbling by the musicians.  There were a few concert vignettes, most of which were sub-par performances with poor audio and video quality.  Overall it was like watching home movies of a bunch of drunken/stoned individuals doing nothing and speaking what may have been English but wasn't the least bit coherent.  A waste of time and money.",1422662400,7,536,4.670212765957447
8636861,2,B00HWCJFKU,"Too much nothing happening on the bus, not enough music.",1412726400,,56,4.7
8636862,4,B00HWCJFKU,"Great footage, great musicians, great music. Too short. Only about half, if memory serves, of the tunes that appeared on the LP are filmed.",1407542400,2,139,4.833333333333333
8636863,5,B00HWCJFKU,"I'd say, if you remember that time and perhaps like those bands, this is an awesome time capsule. I enjoyed it very much.",1402012800,3,121,4.304347826086956
8636864,5,B00HWCJFKU,"After wearing out two dubbed VHS tapes over the years, this clean print from the film's director is a godsend. A priceless glimpse at the birth of New Wave, this documentary of the 1977 ""Live Stiffs"" tour captures Ian Dury, Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric and Larry Wallis in all of their early glory. Historically significant and highly recommended...not to mention a hell of a fun ride! Worth every penny.",1395014400,11,417,4.887323943661972
8636865,5,B00HWCJFKU,"Had seen bits and pieces of this over the years but great to see the complete package. Audio was spot on, performances are truly excellent. Drunken shenanigans are more National Express than Festival Express but you had the Dead on the train. A few cringe-worthy moments involving young female fans (I'm looking at you Attractions rhythm section), great bus banter from Wreckless Eric and Davey Payne. Costello channeling all that revenge and guilt on stage, a few 'mile-melters' from Mr. Lowe in the back of the bus and of course, Larry Wallis' hair. Buy it now while you still can",1393286400,5,582,4.83
