8494848,5,B0068MWKCK,"""Les Aventuriers"" (French, 1967, directed by Robert Enrico; novel by Jose Giovanni) presents European adventure cinema at its best. We have a strong, original, interesting plot and natural, subtle performances by Lino Ventura as Roland Ventura (the failed inventor), Alain Delon as Manu Borelli (the failed stunt pilot), and Joanna Shimkus as Laetitia Weiss (the failed artist). Yet we see through their combined failures - there emerges three classical characters who will embark on a most original adventure - to search out in an old boat way out on the ocean floor for a downed plane with valuable satchels onboard. Their motives are clear. They are broke. They need the money. Depth of plot and character are upon us in this story. We sense danger. We do not know when it will happen, but the line of tension is drawn across the bow of their boat like a thin line of veiled death.

At once we are struck by the sensitive romance between Manu and Laetitia. They fall in love, and we witness the tenderness between them. It is all very direct. We hear the story about the lost plane. Our sense of intrigue is engaged. We are drawn into the beautifully-photographed 'underwater search' for the plane (Jean Boffety at the camera); you are there, pulling open the doors, reaching under the skeletons for the satchels. Immediacy in art is further enhanced by the stunning cinematography. Then, tragedy occurs. To say what happens would be to spoil the plot unfolding - the superior denouement within the film's powerful finish. Once again with a Delon film, we are struck by his acts of kindness towards women and children; he seems to resonate qualities in these films that endear him to audiences. Here he has the opportunity to act alongside a great actor (Ventura).

It would be remiss of me to say another word about the plot. This flawless movie deserves a fresh viewing by those who have never seen it. Yes, I was stunned by the ending atop Fort Boyard. Yes, in the aftermath I wanted to hold onto this story and change the ending - make it go away - but that would remove its place among the classical tragedies of our day - in European cinema. My emotions were affected by it. So, if you seek such an experience - where exquisite filmmaking deserves your undivided attention - then ""Les Aventuriers"" would qualify for that rainy night with a glass of wine and a comfortable pillow. And yes, Manu kisses Laetitia with sufficient passion to light the torches.
