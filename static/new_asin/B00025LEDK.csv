8022479,3,B00025LEDK,"This a well-scrubbed account of the early LDS travails, and the construction of the SLC LDS temple. Anyone familiar with the accurate history of Joseph Smith, and many of his followers, will notice right away the sanitizing that the makers of this movie employed. A truthful account of early LDS history would be hard to behold, for both Mormons and non-Mormons.

This film is well-made, graphically, and the script is tolerable, if a little corny and self-congratulatory at times. This not how it was by a long-shot, but it makes contemporary Mormons comfortable and proud to see this iteration of history.",1398988800,,607,5.00990099009901
8022480,5,B00025LEDK,"The movie, Mountain of the Lord, is not a history of Brigham Young nor of the Mormon people. It's a narrative about temple building in the latter days, taken from the journals of Wilford Woodruff - the 4th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The movie portrays President Wilford Woodruff telling the story of temple building to a young, Eastern newspaper reporter, Mr. Callahan. ""The Mountain"" refers to the House of the Lord or The Temple. Old Testament Prophets, such as Isaiah, also referred to the house of the Lord as the mountain of the Lord. (Isaiah 2:3). Though briefly touched upon, this is not a movie about why temples are built or about the ordinances performed therein. It's a movie that primarily focuses on the highlights of the building of the Salt Lake City Temple.

The movie greatly impressed me with the hard work and dedication of the early pioneers who had nothing, but gave their all to the construction of their temple.

The acting is credible. The scenery and cinematography are beautiful. Historically it is accurate. The movie well portrays the Herculean task taken on by this small religious group of people far removed from civilization. But, it's more than this. It's a movie of the indomitable spirit of the American pioneer who crossed the Plains and built a great empire from East to West. Salt Lake City, Utah is known as the crossroads of the West. Its crown jewel is the temple, which took 40 years to build and is now visited by more than a million people every year.

This is a great movie and a story that should be of interest to every enthusiast of American West history. The story is fascinating and the movie is well done. I highly recommend it.",1223769600,8,1714,4.687707641196013
8022481,1,B00025LEDK,I thought this movie lacked substance.  The members of the Latter Day Saints wanted to build a Temple  -- and they did.  It was never explained why the LDS members were rejected by their neighbors.  I thought the movie was too superficial.  I wanted to see more of Brigham Young's life and ministry.  I suppose the movie seems so contrived because it was produced by the LDS Church.  After viewing this movie I still don't understand why it was made.,1169078400,3,450,4.55
8022482,4,B00025LEDK,"I am not LDS, but enjoy reading history. After reading M.R.Werner's biography of Brigham Young I was eager to find material that presented the Saints (as they call themselves, and as I believe many of them must be!) as rational people with will and vision, i.e. people the rest of us might identify with and admire. This film does. B.Y. was by any measure a man of history, and would have been singled out for mention in any age. It offers no apologies and is truthful to the openness and genuine love of the Saints towards each other. The ""outsider"", a young reporter interviewing B.Y., by the end of the story is shown as beginning to question his own beliefs and begin, however tentatively, to dare consider that the Mormon religion just might have some answers for him. He is never shown as a slavish follower (no one in the film is) nor is there a hint that he will suddenly convert, in satisfying contrast to religious stories that show a man's spiritual growth to have no more substance than the turn of the page of a comic book.

This is one neat movie. The direction, art, and acting are all top notch, and the scenery is of course fabulous. I am very glad I put away some of my childish things to buy it and watch it.",1102464000,17,1227,4.381578947368421
