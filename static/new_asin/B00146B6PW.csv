Typical of any exploitation film, Japanese or otherwise, it was produced primarily to cater to a small yet profitable audience that is really wants to test limits of freedom of speech - I am no prude but its also hard to find redeeming value to this series.

The La Blue Girl series is one of the longest running pornographic franchises that introduced just about every stereotype that we think about Japanese adult animation - the gratuitous nudity, the bloody violence, and the bizarre and particular storylines that merge particular epochs of Japanese culture.  This series is actually of 3 two-part series that feature the heroine Ninja-in-training Miko Mido and her dubious sidekick nin-nin as they fight underworld monsters... with sex!  In the first part, Miko is thrust into the limelight after her mentor/grandmother is killed in the first salvo launched by a renegade band of Demons called Shikima in their quest to take over the dimension of humans.  In the second part, Miko is lead to the country side where unbeknownst to her the shocking crimes occurring there are a lure to a trap.  The third part introduces a rival to Miko and both get entwined in a plot to kill the Shikima king.

Like any adult movie that tries to have a plot, the results are questionable - moreso in animated form.  The first part (episodes 1 and 2) suffer from a production problem so bad you can almost see the cel changes but the production quality rises to ""saturday morning cartoon"" quality by parts 3 and 4.  Overall, the storyline of the entire series is like a more adult version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-Hunter-Yohko/dp/B00074CBPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil Hunter Yohko</a>&nbsp;with its demon fighting girl in costumes and transformations made specifically for an audience where battle action and sex appeal is not enough. This being a Toshio Maeda production it features all the hallmarks of Japanese shock that as dated as it is, can still make most Americans raise their brow in incomprehension.",1423612800,3,2204,5.168539325842697
