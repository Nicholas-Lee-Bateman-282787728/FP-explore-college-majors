4212212,4,B003VWC12E,"Is this a great movie?  No.  Should you see it?  Yes. I think of it as a mixture of Monty Python and Woody Allen; it unfolds as a story of an average Muslim in London who accidentally finds out that he was born a Jew but was given up for adoption.  Because he learns that his ""birth"" father is dying in rest home, he wants to become sufficiently ""Jewish"" to meet his dad...but this will create cosmic waves in his own family because he has always been a Muslim. Worse -  his son wants to marry the step-daughter of a radical cleric.  There are lots of funny moments because the characters are nicely played.  Enjoy but don't ask more than the film can deliver.",1293062400,2,660,4.274193548387097

4212214,4,B003VWC12E,"I'm glad this popped up as an instant play title on a movie rental site I subscribe to. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with a title like ""Infidel"", with a man dressed in Muslim attire eating a bagel! Well I was pleasantly surprised and entertained - this is a movie that pokes fun at two different cultures but does so in an irreverent and funny manner.

Mahmud (comedian Omid Djalili) is a moderate Muslim who may not be fully observant but considers himself a true believer and takes pride in his family (wife, son, and young daughter). His mother's death brings a secret to light - Mahmud was adopted, and his birth name was Solly Shimshillewitz! This revelation predictably upsets Mahmud and causes him great confusion. What is he to do? Can he reveal his secret to his wife, children and close friends? Given the strife between the Palestinians and Israelis and the general climate of distrust between Muslims and Jews, how is Mahmud to reconcile his Jewish heritage and his Muslim identity?

Fortunately, Mahmud finds help in Lenny (Richard Schiff). Initially, both men are almost enemies, constantly bickering and fighting, but when Mahmud discovers his Jewish background, he turns to Lenny out of desperation. This results in some truly funny moments - Lenny teaching Mahmud how to shrug, how to say ""oy vey"", and prepares Mahmud for a 'rite of passage', accompanying Lenny to a bar mitzvah! This may all be funny, but there is also a sense of poignancy. Mahmud's efforts at getting in touch with his inner Jew has to do with his attempts to meet his dying Jewish dad who is in a nursing home.

Amidst all this, Mahmud also faces the problem of how to handle his son's impending marriage to the step-daughter of a radical Muslim cleric. The scene where the cleric comes to Mahmud's house to check his family out is one of the funniest in the film. Mahmud can't bear to think what will happen if his secret is found out...what is Mahmud/Solly to do? The acting by Omid Djalili is amazing, and he is able to credibly convey the comedic elements of his character's plight as well as the poignant moments. The portrayal of the Muslim and Jewish cultures is well done and though the movie does poke fun at both cultures, it is a balanced portrayal. The supporting cast is equally brilliant and the result is a farcical comedy that entertains.",1290211200,9,2349,4.682808716707021
4212215,4,B003VWC12E,"Mahmud's mother passes away, and while cleaning her house, he finds out he was adopted.  And it gets better; he was born Solly Shimshillewitz.  Oy vey.

A Londoner of Pakistani descent has a enough trouble; his dad past away a while ago and his mom just died, his son is marrying the step-daughter of radical imam, but his wife loves him despite his numerous flaws.  Then he finds out he was born Jewish, and it is off to the rodeo as he tries to come to terms with his heritage and upbringing.

The more you know about both Jewish and Islamic culture, the funnier this movie will be.  Mahmud nee Solly learning how to shrug properly, and his dream/nightmare sequence are worth the price of admission.  It's only a movie, and a comedy at that, but it does hint at interesting dynamics in London Pakistani homelife, and the complexities of both cultures.

I enjoyed it a lot, but a lot of the comedy will pass by folks not familiar with the cultures involved.

This is the ultimate message delivered by this family friendy fun film about a life long Moslem who suddenly discovers that his birth parents were -- GASP! -- Jews!

In one delightful reveal after another this movie follows one hilarious delight after another.  At the outset we meet our hero a family man and good Dad even if he isn't too bright or that observant of a Moslem. At the same time we learn this man is about to meet is son's prospective wife's father in law, a rabid fundamentalist Imam.  In true comic fashion it's just at this point we learn that our hero wasn't born Moslem but rather Saulie Chimchimovitz (please forgive me if I got the spelling wrong!).

When I came across this movie a while back, I recommended it to a colleague who showed it in her Cultural class. Then when it came my turn to teach a global cultural class I decided to visit this movie again and ended up buying it. This is a comedy with some F** bombs so am not sure if every faculty will feel comfortable showing this in class. BUT if you are a non-traditional teacher, this movie is definitely worth visiting and considering. Even a small portion of it. The class can then discuss if hate that is engrained in our children's mind a social construct? What makes us human? Our personal journey or our religion? Why is there a religious segregation?

Most importantly, if one grows up in a Jewish family and was taught to hate Muslims, only to find out he was Muslim at birth, what then?

Lest it go unaddressed, the film at its core is a very unfair negative comparative religious analysis where the virtues of Judaism are completely absent, and (surprise, surprise) Islam reigns supreme.  Full of pernicious stereotypes, the humor is at best a failure.  At worst, it is hate in a shabby disguise.  Don't waste your time, unless you are watching the film for purposes of understanding the deep complexities of interfaith conflict.  The film in no way contributes positively to the improvement of interfaith relations.

The lead character is very relatable as the confused man trying to work out a dilemma without offending anyone in the process.  The story line assists the viewer in learning about the Jewish and Muslim faiths, albeit on a very superficial level, and how they are different and yet at their roots are teaching similar concepts.  There are plenty of laughs at the lead character's expense, but not in a cruel way.

The only drawback was that some of the conversation was hard to understand, due to dialect and accent.  After the first 10 minutes or so, I got used to the accents and could understand it better.

4212276,5,B003VWC12E,"Adopted boy doesn't find out he's adopted until late in life. Raised as a Muslim but perhaps born as a Jew. A movie of insightful humor and yet serious topics e.g.dad has his Jewish son baptized as a Catholic at age 11. Years later the son, out of curiosity, asks his dad why both and dad says, ""You know son, just in case."" Insightful lines where Muslim says to Jew and Jew to Muslim, ""What is it with you people!"" A line that points out the commonality of racial/ethnic/religious stereotyping and prejudice. Use of dialogue, settings and props (e.g. placement of a The Koran and Hebrew Bible side by side). Unexpected ending where a wedding appears to be a Bollywood Hindi compromise to the Muslim/Jew discord that enveloped most of the movie.
On the most serious side, our protagonist-antagonist characters get to the emotional root - death as a result of Israel-Palestine violence where one posits the innocent death by suicide bombers while the other counters with the United States of Israel superior military resulting in disproportionate deaths of thousands of Palestinians to hundreds of Israelites (the actual numbers since 2000 are closer to 6500 Palestinians of which 1300 are 18 or younger and 1100 Israelites with 130, 18 or younger).
The other serious tet-a-tet they had was concerning the absurd claim to Jerusalem based on ""who got there first"". Help! Have humans regressed that much? (my comment).

Interesting special features discussions amongst the crew about the film such as why comedy is so strong amongst the Jewish community yet not amongst Muslims, Buddhists, Christian fundamentalists.

This is not a well-written finely observed comedy.  The anti-semitism isn't strident, but couched in a series of lame jokes.  At one point of emotional breakthrough, the muslim main character purposefully punches out a rabbi while he is praying.

It's a great premise for a comedy and the film delivers, not only with the British humor, but with countless subtle and not so subtle jokes. It helps a lot to know about either of these cultures, but even so, you will miss some of the subtler jokes. My wife is a Muslim and she was laughing hysterically at some of the passages (like the scene where Leny takes him to a bar mitzvah and he's trying to pass himself off as a Jew in order to learn more about Jewish culture; a drunken Leny drags him onto the stage and forces him to make a joke and the first thing that comes out of his mouth is the automatic invocation, ""In Allah's name..."").

I'm buying this movie.",1342656000,,1100,4.233333333333333
4212280,5,B003VWC12E,"This one of the BEST movies I've seen in a long time.  The main actor was very funny, and the supporting cast was excellent.  I got many chuckles, and laughs, and it was also moving as well.  IMHO, it was a very well done film.",1337904000,,227,4.0
4212281,5,B003VWC12E,"Took a shot in the dark with this one, but as a big fan of british comedy-I thought the idea/concept of the story might be funny.  I was not disappointed.  Highly recommended, the characters are true, funny and the story interesting and intelligent.
Bravo-Highly recommended watching",1326844800,,283,5.130434782608695
4212282,4,B003VWC12E,"Loved this film. As an Englishman, I like the quirky English humour in it, but it should also appeal to a wider audience. Some fantastic one liners and responses from the main cast. Bit of a cheesy ending but I imagine it's a tough script to wrap up. Great work all round.",1320451200,,272,4.25

Great acting by the main character. His facial expressions are simply hilarious ...",1314576000,,130,5.238095238095238

4212285,4,B003VWC12E,"The story line was somewhat plausible. The situationally based humor was funny.

My only grump is the language. The level of profanity was a detraction, 95% of the ""f"" words could have been stripped and the movie would have transformed itself into a cute film. More appropriate family movie addressing serious issues in an approachable way.

Hopefully, we will see more films in this genre.",1312588800,,390,4.984615384615385

4212287,5,B003VWC12E,"This film should be shown everywhere. If anything is going to bridge the Muslim-Jewish divide it's humor. This film takes the wind right out of your lungs in every scene. It may be a bit difficult to follow for people who don't know much about Jewish or Muslim culture, but it is well worth learning just to see this film! If you are familiar with the actor playing Arshad Al-Masri, a radical Muslim cleric, you know that he is none other than Israeli Jewish actor Yigal Naor. That alone is an irony that should make you laugh!",1300320000,,527,4.443298969072165

I don't want to give away the story line, but suffice it to say that if you have a good sense of humor, you are going to laugh your butt off.",1503360000,,284,3.6721311475409837
8407138,4,B003VWC12E,"The character Mahmud Nasir is a so-so practicing Muslim.  He's also a great husband and father.  But his world gets complicated when his son wants to marry the step-daughter of a man he can't stand.  At the same time, he finds out the true about his past while cleaning out his deceased mother's house.
I know some people watching this film are offended by his very foul mouth with a temper to match.  But that's the character of Mahmud Nasir. And some people are just like that!  It's not as if everybody in the movie is swearing.  I think if you can just shut it out (or turn off the sound when he goes into one of his rages)  you'll really like the story line. Mahmud is an easy character to like.",1490918400,,700,4.257575757575758

8407140,2,B003VWC12E,"We rented this after the number of positive reviews and the nomination from the TFF.  However, none of us in a mixed faith family (Christian/Muslim)  found this funny or terribly insightful.  And the movie itself just seemed to plod along.  It lacked pacing, good direction and could have used critical editing and a cohesive soundtrack.

That said, the acting was decent, the main topic was interesting and there were a few funny jokes.  But, after watching this, its hard to reconcile it with the number of positive reviews that it received.  I think the positive reviews reflect both  the dearth of movies that competently deal with religion and the way in which faith is practiced along a spectrum and a yearning for the intersection of faiths to be explored in cinema.",1483228800,,773,4.847328244274809
