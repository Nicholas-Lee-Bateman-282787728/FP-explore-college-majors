I'm an advanced beginner and could do the steps, but definitely not up to speed, so I found that a bit intimidating.",1346112000,3,274,4.913043478260869
8275190,5,B0019T022M,"The thing I really liked about this DVD is instructor Gregg Russell's ease of teaching. Aside from being very thorough , his humorous approach really engages the viewer and makes learning more fun. He demonstrates each combination or exercise from the back, and first uses counts, then repeats using the names of the steps. This method made the DVD very easy to follow and I found his gradual demonstrations of each step particularly useful. The camera work is excellent and there are close-ups on the feet for each combination so you can see every heel drop, flap, shuffle, etc.

The DVD is jam-packed with material for advanced beginners to advanced levels and I particularly enjoyed his sections on wings and pullbacks.

I recommend it for anyone who has learned the basics of Tap dancing and want to further their vocabulary and skill level. Congratulations Gregg !",1256688000,3,869,4.945205479452055
