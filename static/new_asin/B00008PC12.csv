1856753,3,B00008PC12,"Occasionally harrowing, low-budget Korean War drama receives a bare-bones treatment on DVD, with no extras and no anamorphic enhancement.  In many ways the prototype for Vietnam movies of the 1970 and '80s, _War Hunt_ serves up a pretentious, heavy-handed allegory of American intervention: A psychotic American soldier (John Saxon) takes an orphaned Korean boy under his wing, and becomes completely unhinged when informed at war's end that the boy and he must go their separate ways.  Young Robert Redford, fatuous as ever, makes his film debut as a soldier with the prettiest blow-dry hair in military history.

Fragile, subtly anti-American, and oh-so-tasteful, _War Hunt_ hardly qualifies as a masterpiece.  Still, Ted McCord's black-and-white cinematography is excellent (you'd never guess the film was actually shot in California), and the musical score is spare and restrained.  The film is not without interest, and it has cast a surprisingly long shadow over the years.",1208995200,,979,5.456953642384106
1856754,3,B00008PC12,"The 'psychotic' hero is an essay captured in two fine War films: Donald Siegal's ""Hell Is For Heroes""-- the story of a sergeant who for being psychotic embarked on suicidal heroic missions, and our distinguished film ""War Hunt.""

The picture is clearly stated and openly defined... Pvt. Raymond Endore (John Saxon) goes out at night on 'solitary' patrols... The information he brings back is very useful for Capt. Wallace Pratt (Charles Aidman) whose posture toward Endore is 'paternal' gratification...

But the strong reason to his voluntary patrol is to murder... He is a ritual killer practicing a formal act with his knife, and after finishing with his victim, he stands behind the body in mystical meditation...

Even after the cease-fire on the Korean front, Endore extends his night patrols... This 'psycho' mind is already sick, and there is nothing to be done to narrow his actions...

With just one major battle scene, ""War Hunt"" is absolutely a penetrating study of War drama, focusing on its traumatic effects: The 'fighting' soldier and the 'non-fighting' man...

""War Hunt"" is ingenious, deeply stimulating, and cautiously photographed... The extraordinary hand-to-hand fight, between Redford and the Chinese soldier, proves it...

John Saxon is terrific as the tormentor and Robert Redford (in his film's debut) is excellent as the idealistic Pvt. Roy Loomis...",1168905600,2,1377,5.32258064516129
1856755,2,B00008PC12,"**THIS IS FOR THE DVD VERSION ONLY**

To real fans, a dissapointment. To other fans not so good. There are no extras on this DVD, in other words, a barebones DVD. This DVD DOES have the original Theatrical Trailer, and English, Spanish, and French subtitles. This DVD only comes in widescreen.",1157414400,,293,4.745098039215686
1856756,4,B00008PC12,"War Hunt is an absorbing comparison of the effects of war on two individuals.

One responded to the emotional impact of killing by embracing it.  He becomes an isolated, cold and silent killing machine who creeps up at night and kills with a knife, then dances around the bodies. His only emotinal connection is with a young house boy.  His influene on that child is chilling.

The second is embodied in the introdcution of Robert Redford to the screen.  The war seen through his eyes is tragic and wasteful.  His bravery in confronting the evil influence of the first soldier represents a nobility in a man that is in sharp contrast to the dehumanizing effects of the war.

Some would argue that the film effects, representing the state of the art in 1961 give a dated feel that is distracting.  However this lends a grittiness and documentary feel that enhances the message.

The popcorn will be forgotton.  Save if for a second feature of a much lighter or comic vein, as this heavy film is better digested in pieces over time than brooded over as the only thought late in the evening.",1141344000,8,1088,4.619791666666667
1856757,4,B00008PC12,"The Korean ""police action"" gets a good look in this interesting film.  I can't help but compare the Chinese propoganda machine calling out to our troops telling them they are dying for an ""imperialist"" government when we have troops dying in Iraq for our current ""imperialist"" government.

John Saxon is great in his role as....well, watch the film, eh?

There's more to this flick than war.  Redford does well as the ""rookie"" and the rest of the cast does a great job too.

All in all, a good film for a slow Saturday afternoon.",1135987200,5,529,4.585106382978723
1856758,4,B00008PC12,"This is an obviously low-budget affair, but don't let that dissuade you from at least screening this film.
Set in the waning days of the Korean War, the story revolves around a new replacement (Robert Redford), who joins an infantry unit on the front lines. As he experiences the bitter taste of war, he tries to understand the meaning of it all. Meanwhile, he is concerned over the psychotic lone wolf in the outfit (John Saxon), and his bizzare attachment to a young Korean kid. Saxon's character is a successful killing machine, but unaccustomed to fitting in with people.
The main selling point is, of course, the film debut of Robert Redford. Redford is excellent here, even at a relatively young age. Redford has always been good at playing honest, good-guy straight shooters, and his debut as Pvt. Roy Loomis is no exception. However, it really has to be said that, for as good as the young Redford is, it is John Saxon who steals the show as the brooding, psychotic killing machine, Endore. If you don't believe me, just check out the scene when Redford confronts him, and Saxon shows us a murderer using every ounce of control at his command to master his anger and keep from killing.
Gavin MacLeod and Tom Skerritt play fellow soldiers in the squad, and the stark black & white photography assists in setting the proper mood for the story.",1055116800,28,1349,4.69620253164557
1856759,4,B00008PC12,very heavy war story  but great in that we get to see a VERY young Robert  Redford  and the ever handsome John Saxon as the bad guy .. good battle scenes ... but dark brooding and violent !,1053561600,5,189,3.9210526315789473
1856760,5,B00008PC12,"I liked A LOT this little known 1962 black and white war movie. It is an independent production made on a little budget with actors who were then completely unknown, but it packs TERRIFIC punch. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Near the end of the Korean War a new replacement, Private Loomis (Robert Redford), is assigned to an infantry company in the front line. He soon meets a quiet fellow soldier, Private Endore (John Saxon) and is quickly warned by others in the company not to speak to him. It appears that Endore is a very peculiar and quite scary fellow, who has a gift to infiltrate enemy lines to observe and gather information - but he also hunts and kills isolated enemy soldiers... Company Commander Captain Pratt (Charles Aidman) lets Endore go on those ""hunting"" raids because he appreciates the intelligence he brings back. But ultimately this situation must bring trouble...

The making of this film was in itself a kind of adventure in cinematographic guerrilla, as it was in large part a huge improvisation by a bunch of pals. Brothers Denis and Terry Sanders managed to gather 250 thousand dollars to produce an independent war film - the former also directed - and it turned out quickly that it wasn't enough. In order to dissimulate this lack of means, they put most of the action of the film at night. As their wages were lower, actors who usually appeared on TV were hired like John Saxon, Charles Aidman, Gavin MacLeod (Private Crotty), William Challee (the battalion commander) and especially young and at that time almost completely unknown Robert Redford, for whom it was the first credited cinema role ever.

Another young TV actor, a certain Sydney Pollack, also got a part - he plays Sergeant Van Horn. It was during the work on ""War Hunt"" that he met and befriended Robert Redford - and the rest is part of history of cinema (""Jeremiah Johnson"", ""Three days of Condor"", ""Out of Africa"")... The role of Sergeant Showalter went to a complete beginner, for whom it was the first role ever in anything, a guy named Tom Skerritt... Some friends of the producers also gave a hand for free, like a certain Francis Ford Coppola, who at that time was a struggling assistant director to Roger Corman - in this film he plays an (uncredited) role of a truck driver.

Pentagon was asked to provide some assistance in making of this film, this was however gently but firmly refused, as US Army public relations department was incensed by the scenario. Their objections concerned mostly the very idea that a company commander (an officer with at least eight years of experience) could allow one of his soldiers to wage a kind of ""private war"" and also dispense this man from observing any regular military discipline and regulations - and honestly, I can understand that.

I still think however that it is a pity that US Army didn't help with this film, because even if it tells a pretty powerful story, it is actually surprisingly moderate in its general tone concerning all things military. If we except the captain who plays a dangerous game with a clearly unstable soldier, all the rest of military institution actually works logically and rather efficiently. As this is clear now that war will end very soon, high ranking officers and professional NCOs try very hard to prevent any further needless casualties. When battle is joined, all differences and grudges are momentarily forgotten and everybody stands shoulder to shoulder, against the common enemy. Officers really care about the welfare of their soldiers. The battalion commander is a clever, grizzled old war horse, who instantly understands that Endore is a huge problem the moment he sets his eyes on him. The captain, a rather likeable guy by the way, certainly messes up the situation, but even him, once things turn badly, will own up to his errors and will try to correct them - at no small risk for his own life... At no moment it is suggested that army or war made Endore into a killer - in fact quite to the contrary, we quickly realise that this guy arrived on the front already irremediably damaged, before even his first killing. Etc. etc.

There are of course some plot holes. The biggest one is the fact that Endore could ""hunt"" for many months in the same sector of the front. The Chinese soldiers in Korean War were quite dangerous, ruthless and resourceful opponents - they would never allow such a situation to last for months. Even in the worse, laziest army of the world engaged in such a static long term war, when one sentry manning an advanced post is killed at night, the vigilance is doubled. If two such incidents occur, few men will sleep at night after that - most of them will be waiting for enemy infiltrators, with their weapons ready to shoot (they can later sleep by shifts after sun rises). If three such killings happen, any commanding officer worth his salt will do EVERYTHING in his power to prevent more such casualties. It means that further infiltrations will be met by new minefields, better and more numerous booby traps, more frequent illumination, ambushes, snipers, aggressive counter-patrolling, mortar (or even artillery) fire at the slightest alert, quite possibly retaliatory counter-raiding and certainly all other possible counter-measures I didn't think off. When the enemy is forewarned, ready, armed and on full alert, no matter how good the infiltrators are, they will be detected and vigorously countered (even the Predator, with all its alien camouflage technology and superhuman skills, got clipped in an ambush after his second killing). BUT, this film is so good, that even this ENORMOUS plot hole doesn't affect in any way my five star rating.

This is a REALLY GOOD war film and a REALLY GOOD war time story. I will certainly keep my DVD for another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1417737600,,5852,4.816915422885572

1856763,4,B00008PC12,"Some movies are better known for events surrounding the film than for the actual contents. ""War Hunt"" is a prime example. It's a solid low budget Korean War B-movie that's all but forgotten today, but it's a good bet that it would be completely forgotten (and never available on DVD) but for one detail. Namely, ""War Hunt"" marked the feature film debut of a promising TV actor named Robert Redford.

The movie is set during the closing days of the war, as US troops and their Chinese counterparts face off in trench warfare along what will become the Demilitarized Zone. Most of the troops just want to keep their heads down and survive, except for Raymond Endore. John Saxon gets top billing as Endore, a G.I. who's been on the front lines far too long and has become an unhinged killing machine, going out on clandestine missions behind enemy lines, slashing Chinese throats and gathering intelligence. Endore is poorly equipped to handle either normal military or civilian life but has found his niche as a killer whom the rest of the squad gives a wide berth. Endore's only human connection is with Charlie, a young Korean orphan whom he has taken under his wing, with the boy gradually picking up some of Endore's sociopathic tendencies.

The only one to stand up to Endore is Roy Loomis, played by Redford, a late war replacement who starts out as a dewy eyed optimist but gradually learns what's going on. Loomis is concerned about Charlie and tries to win the boy over by playing baseball with him, leading to a confrontation with Endore. Most B-movies of this nature would probably feature a bland pretty boy in the Loomis role and would quickly become a character study of Endore. However, Redford steals the picture easily from the two-dimensional Saxon (who alternately plays unsure and deranged). Redford is likable but nave at first, with his decent sincerity clashing with Saxon's sinister nature. However, when the troops come under fire, Redford panics and then is left behind when the Americans temporarily are forced to retreat. It's a well rounded, gritty performance by Redford, who, more importantly, demonstrates his star power in the making by commanding the screen during his scenes, especially when he tries to stand up to Saxon.

Besides Redford's performance, the other interesting aspect of the film is its unusual point of view. Few if any movies highlighted this aspect of the war, the futility of going through the motions day after day while the Chinese blared anti-war propaganda at the troops, knowing that nothing they did would make a difference as far as the by-then preordained outcome of the conflict. Within a few years, the Vietnam War made this type of antiwar message palatable (as evidenced by the movie and TV show, MASH), but it was a fairly new concept in 1962 (the year in which The Longest Day celebrated US heroism in World War II). It's not surprising ""War Hunt"" did little business at the box office.

In addition to Redford and Saxon, the movie boasts some other familiar faces in early roles. Tom Skerritt and Gavin MacLeod play two of Redford's fellow squad mates, while Sydney Pollack, not yet known as a director, makes his big screen debut as their sergeant. Despite the obvious low budget, the one battle scene is well done, and the setting seems authentic. Unfortunately for DVD viewers, the widescreen DVD is not anamorphic.

Some viewers may want to see this movie just for the sake of seeing Robert Redford, and it's certainly a worthy vehicle for him. More than that, however, this is a solid, albeit nearly forgotten, drama about a nearly forgotten conflict.",1398384000,,3624,4.857605177993528

1856768,5,B00008PC12,"""War Hunt"" holds up remarkably well.  While the release date is listed as 1962, the copyright is 1961, which makes this a 50th anniversary of Redford's first film.  The gritty story shot in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area stars John Saxon as Private Raymond Endore, a psychotic soldier transfixed on killing who is allowed personal scouting raids into enemy territory.  The film is also significant because it begins a great friendship and working collaboration between Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack who plays Sgt.

Tom Skerritt has a strong supporting performance as Sgt. Stan Showalter; and Gavin McLeod who later achieved fame on TV's ""The Love Boat"" played Pvt. Crott.  Francis Ford Coppola plays an Army truck driver and was a gofer on the film.  Redford's performance is impressive, subtle, gritty and focused.

1856769,4,B00008PC12,"...As stated elsewhere, Saxon is the real star of this film... Redford does a good job with his character... well meaning, but absolutely unable to make changes, let alone conjure up any heroic actions... Witnessing and surviving are the best that he can do... We are meant to see this story unfold through the eyes of a decent, ""All American boy..."" drafted and sent to the sharp end...

  ...Definitely low budget:  The Army would not touch this production with a ten foot pole... But the film has a story to tell and does it well.  It is unfortunate that Gavin McCleod is a distraction... but he was absolutely unknown when this film was made and his presence was not jarring...  On the other hand, the character of the visiting battalion commander is *vastly* too old...

  ...Real talent used on this film... Even Francis Ford Coppola (uncredited) who was said to be one of the camera men... who also doubled as an extra driving one of the Army trucks...

  ...As someone who has led and commanded infantry in two wars I can understand the *temptation* of the company commander (though I do not agree with his decision) to play with fire... to use Saxon's character, in spite of the clear dangers...  Aside from the natural tendency not to want to get your men killed in extremely dangerous night patrols (and most of them unwilling draftees likely, if they survive... to bring back little information.)  Saxon's character is an extremely dangerous weapon... that needs always to be pointed in the right direction...

  ...I have heard complaints that Saxon's character would never have made it through basic training... let alone having been deployed.  True enough, except that sometimes people just ""get along"" during training and keep a low profile.  Once ""unzipped"" on the steep Korean ridgelines... his real inclinations would spill out... and would grow... to where you could never ""get them back into the bag"" again...

  ...The ending of this film is deeply haunting.
