381658,4,6301959949,Searched a long time for this Classic John Wayne Movie. Happy to find it to be able to add this to my Collection,1196121600,,112,3.9130434782608696

John Wayne plays Matt Masters who brings his exciting Wild West show to three rings under the Big Top across Europe. Veteran director Henry Hathaway applies his reputation for atmosphere and characterizations to make this more than just another formula movie. Dimitri Tiomkin's score lends just the right touch of melancholy often associated the circus. The ship disaster and the climatic fire sequences are truly spectacular. The film also features Rita Hayworth, Claudia Cardinale, Lloyd Nolan, John Smith and Richard Conte.

381661,3,6301959949,"Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous here. She is evidently the best ingredient in the film. Good enough movie for a family gathering in the afternoon. Melodrama, grand sets, Claudia and the Duke all together.

Now about my copy: A region 2 from Spain. It includes among the extras (only text extras) a Spanish film critic criticizing Mr. Wayne -but not for the way he does his role- for getting rid of Frank Capra, as he was the original director for this work, and bringing his pal Henry Hathaway in. And then the critic proceeds to award him three derogatory names. Well, Mr. Wayne isn't around anymore to defend himself, but I say this: You can't insult the Duke and have my money. I'm not buying anymore European Region 2 copies.

Almost every other Duke film is available but this one is being withheld for some reason.  I have never seen this movie because it is rarely shown on TV and even rarer to find on video tape.  Get this movie on US DVD so I won't have to buy a European DVD of it.  It is ironic that the movies starring the most American of actors are not all available in America. Why do Europeans have the privelege of watching this movie?  European distributors are making the profits that could have been for American distributors.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: 1965 Golden Globe Awards: Win: Best Song in a Motion Picture for Dimitri Tiomkin (music) and Best Song Circus World for Ned Washington (lyrics). Nominated: Best Motion Picture Actress in a Drama for Rita Hayworth. 1965 Golden Laurel Awards: Nominated: Action Performance for John Wayne. While filming a scene where the main tent catches fire, John Wayne was almost killed when the set collapsed. As he was ""fighting"" the fire, Wayne was to be cued by the assistant director when to leave before the set was to collapse in flames. Either John Wayne didn't hear the cue, or the a.d. mistimed it (it was never determined which), but the flaming set began to collapse before John Wayne got out. He escaped with just a few seconds to spare before the entire set would have fallen down on top of him. While the film is taking place in 1901, there are several mistakes with the European flags. One example is the Finnish flag that is seen in the movie. Finland didn't achieved independence and the flag until 1918.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: CIRCUS WORLD that originally was released as The Magnificent Showman in the United Kingdom in 1964, but now with this UK Release, has now been given its original title. This big, sprawling film, beautifully filmed in Cinerama, that is set in the early years of the 20th century, Matt Masters [John Wayne], who is also the foster father of Claudia Cardinale her mother (an aerialist) having left both of them years before. , Matt Masters is an American circus impresario in the early 1900's, decides to take his circus and Wild West Show to Europe, with the ulterior motive of finding Lili Alfredo [Rita Hayworth], mother of Toni Alfredo [Claudia Cardinale], the young circus performer whom Matt Masters has protected since Lili Alfredo's disappearance 14 years earlier.

Lili Alfredo had been married to an aerialist though in love with Matt Masters; and when her husband, The Flying Alfredo who fell to his death, which at the time it was believed that Aldo Alfredo [Richard Conte] dove to his death deliberately when he realised his wife loved Matt Masters and not him. The troupe puts on a show aboard the circus boat in Barcelona; when a performer falls overboard, the huge audience surges to the railing, causing the ship to capsize. No lives are lost, but the circus is destroyed. Matt Masters, Toni Alfredo, and Steve McCabe [John Smith], Toni Alfredo's boyfriend, join a touring Wild West Show and are a great success. Matt Masters plans to put together another show and rehearse it in Spain during the winter before touring.

In Madrid, Lili Alfredo turns up in the audience and later tells Matt Masters that Toni Alfredo is better off not knowing about her mother. Later, Lili Alfredo asks for a job in the circus, but she is still determined to keep her identity a secret, until Tojo [Richard Conte], a clown, tells Toni Alfredo about Lili Alfredo and about her father's suicide. Toni Alfredo becomes hysterical and is about to confront Lili Alfredo in hatred when Matt Masters stops her and tells her that her mother was refused a divorce by her father.

A fire breaks out, and Toni Alfredo and Lili Alfredo, scaling a rope to the top of the tent, save the major part of the big top from burning. When the fire is extinguished, Toni Alfredo and Lili Alfredo embrace and all is forgiven and decides to stay with the circus; and at the opening of the circus the next night, the two perform an aerial act with Rita Hayworth and Claudia Cardinale astounding the crowd by doing over one hundred over-the-shoulder one-arm somersaults. But as to the outcome of the film and finale, well you will have to view this Blu-ray to find out.

Blu-ray Video Quality  CIRCUS WORLD has received a really wonderful restoration, with its stunning sparkling 1080p encoded image and also offering a beautiful transfer with an equally stunning 2.20:1 [Super Technirama-70] aspect ratio and seems to have undergone a meticulous frame-by-frame clean-up, culled from the original 35mm horizontal 8 perf Technirama negative with a total professional job. The source is just about impeccable, with no traces of dirt or blemishes. Blacks are pure, and contrast is vibrant and retains a definite filmic look quality. The originally, already-brilliant Technicolor palette is superior and in some cases, greatly improved over the previous inferior DVD version. Detail and sharpness also receive a noticeable boost. The image is three-dimensional, with appreciable depth and excellent clarity even in the most detailed shots. It's also no surprise that this is a rock-solid encoded image, with no apparent edge enhancement or motion artefacts. CIRCUS WORLD was restored and re-mastered to HD [1080p] quality from the original 35mm horizontal 8 perf Technirama negative by Pinewood Post Production in the United Kingdom. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Anchor Bay Entertainment has brought you CIRCUS WORLD that has gone above and beyond with the audio quality experience with this film. What you are given is two audio tracks, which includes a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, which you have to select in the menu, as it automatically goes to the 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. With the 5.1 mix it is a full bodied soundstage experience. Minor ambiance is also nicely sustained, particularly during the outdoor action, but the rear speakers come into play more prominently when you have the full orchestra go into overdrive to great effect. The music score is also technically impeccable, with a nice richness I wasn't expecting for an older title like this. So all in all a very nice audio experience, that especially helps you to enjoy the circus environment you view on the screen.

Blu-ray Special Feature and Extras: Sadly there are no extras with this Blu-ray release. But what you do get is the original film release  INTERMISSION and with it you get the Best Song in a Motion Picture of Dimitri Tiomkin (music) and Best Song Circus World for Ned Washington (lyrics) in the background. Also sadly all you get is a blank screen, but what a shame they could not of supplied a still image of the film title. But what is a slight let down, is the audio has a horrible crackling throughout the intermission, so if they can do a restoration on the image quality, why couldn't they have done an upgrade on the audio presentation.

Finally, here is a real show stopper! Which all can view now with this brilliant Blu-ray release. CIRCUS WORLD is at its best with all the personal drama and spectacle and calamity that can befall a troupe of performers. It's a great film! It is also another outlet venue for the Duke to excel in. I've been searching for this film for a very long time, but now I have been rewarded and definitely belongs in your Blu-ray Collection, like mine now, especially with all the Duke's other great films that have now been released in the Blu-ray format. Henry Hathaway  at least makes the film look gorgeous, filmed in something called Super Technirama-70, but promoted as Cinerama. CIRCUS WORLD is visually rich, with beautiful saturated colours, with an admirable level of kinetic energy sweeping across the screen, particularly in the numerous circus show segments. Henry Hathaway finally finds a pulse in the late catastrophic fire scene that injects some much needed momentum into the CIRCUS WORLD film. Highly Recommended!

Samuel Bronston produced CIRCUS WORLD (USA/Spain-1964) right around the time he was also producing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FALL-OF-THE-ROMAN-EMPIRE/dp/B00125WAXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</a>&nbsp;(1964), a monstrosity of an epic that was released first. ""Roman Empire"" was a huge flop, costing $20 million and earning back only a quarter of that. Because of the loss, PARAMOUNT's largest of 1964, Bronston was forced to sell the Spain facilities where ""Circus World"" was filmed and he was never again able to take on a big budget movie.

CIRCUS WORLD fits the pattern of this sort of picture, with its complicated love story and a climactic disaster scene. This has more three ring sequences than other such films, and they are most entertaining.

In hindsight it's sad to think that co-star Rita Hayworth was beginning to show signs here of the Altzheimer's that would disable her, and during the dramatic blazing tent sequence, leading man John Wayne was almost killed. Later he began coughing up blood, an early indication of lung cancer that Duke chose to ignore.

CW was Ben Hecht's final screenplay. Henry Hathaway did a fine job directing. Except for its melancholy theme song (w./chorus), Dimitri Tiomkin's score is fitting. The real stars though are the many anonymous performers of the Althoff circus, a famous German outfit that has existed since 1660. The story of its mid-20th Century owner, Adolph Althoff and his efforts to save Jews from the Holocaust, would make a most unusual and at times colorful movie.

On first glance you'd think John Wayne would be ill-suited for his role of small circus owner, but his part is also that of a performing Wild West Show star who happens to own a traveling big top. In a nightly encore after the main show, Wayne gallops around the ring and simulates target practice while doing so. He doesn't seem ill-at-ease here, and that goes a long way in making the picture watchable. There's definitely a maudlin element that drives the out-of-ring story, but that's to be expected. This one must've looked great on a widescreen.

Definitely recommended.

He plays the owner of a trouble-laden circus who decides to base himself in Europe and find acts there, and incidentally look for his lost love, played by Rita Hayworth.  Hayworth is very good here, a decade before she sank into deep illness.  Entertaining, and Wayne is always fun to watch.  I bought a Chinese produced DVD with optional English and Chinese sub-titles.  The picture quality is not bad but the sound has an echoing quality to it.  Still, quite watchable.

While the script does get a little lame and belabored over the course of the film - the action scenes are very well staged, with lots of stuntfolks doing spectacular stunts, and action camera work well mounted.  Have a renewed respect for John Wayne and his acting in his later years leading up to TRUE GRIT, because he made believable characters and actor choices, even when he didn't have the best lines to deliver.  Fell in love with Claudia Cardinale once again, and Rita Hayworth had to deal with her personal demons in playing a character with the same personal demons.

They did an excellent job.

The time is the first decade of the 20th century, and Matt Masters (John Wayne), a former ""rodeo bum"" who took over an ailing circus, added a Wild West Show, and has made a success of it in the 20 years since, has an idea: a European tour.  His boss rigger, Cap Carson (Lloyd Nolan), warns that ""Europe has always been a big Jonah for American circuses,"" but Matt is determined--perhaps because he has some hope of finding Lilli Alfredo, the love of his life, who 14 years earlier ran out of the tent in a panic when her aerialist husband fell to his death, and hasn't been seen since.  Matt has raised Lilli's daughter, Toni (Claudia Cardinale), as his own, although he forbids her to attempt high work--which hasn't stopped her from trying it!  With them goes Steve McCabe (John Smith), the headliner of the circus's Wild West segment and Toni's suitor.  But Cap's gloomy prediction proves on target: scarcely has the circus arrived in the Old World than, putting on a shipboard show in Barcelona Harbor, a freak accident leaves their ship half submerged and causes an explosion that destroys their Big Top.  Miraculously no lives--human or animal--are lost, but without a tent, what's a circus?  But Matt's not down yet.  Boarding his animals, he sets out, with Cap, Toni, and Steve, to join Ed Purdy's Wild West and use its tour as a base while he recruits acts for an all-new show.  As he observes, ""Europe is the home of the circus!,"" and acts there are in plenty, including lion tamer Emile Schuman (Hans Dantes) and his managing redheaded wife (Wanda Rotha), and Toni's uncle, Aldo Alfredo (Richard Conte), now known as Tojo the Clown, with his young niece Giovanna (Katharyna), whom Matt envisions doing a ballet routine on the high wire.  Soon all they really need is a headline aerialist.  And then Lilli (Rita Hayworth) finally emerges to see her grown-up daughter...

Amplified with real acts from the Althoff Circus (plus some thrilling Wild West segments), and climaxing with a tent fire that threatens to undo everything Matt has accomplished, this is a good family-friendly film with an engaging cast, notably Smith (then fresh off his role as Slim Sherman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laramie-The-Final-Season/dp/B002C7ELOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laramie: The Final Season</a>), who carries off the kind of ingenue role that James Caan took on in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Dorado/dp/B0035JRUZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Dorado</a>&nbsp;with energy and style.

The current French blu ray does play on Region A blu ray players despite its region B notations and it a beautiful high definitiion print.  The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that the French sub titles cannot be removed when watching the English language version of the film.  And that is mildly annoying.",1349395200,3,455,4.392857142857143
381991,3,6301959949,"If you don't have a PAL Blu-Ray player, but you want to see this film in as close to its original aspect ratio as possible, this Korean import is not a bad deal for the money. The transfer on this DVD is 16X9 (so it will fit your entire Flat Panel screen), and the print quality is as good as your typical Cable broadcast of about 8 years ago before it all went HD. However, if you're very picky about your HD visuals, wait for the proper Blu-ray release (which doesn't seem to be in the works as far as I know).

The flik itself is only mildly interesting unless you're a rabid Wayne fan. The circus survival story is trite and sentimental as all get-up, the big climax consisting of retiree artiste Hayworth going back to doing her rope act (!!!), which is one final big yawn. Everyone from Wayne to Hayworth to director Hathaway's work looks terribly tired, and I'm being kind. This production was the last nail in the coffin of Samuel Bronston's Spanish Film Studio Empire and was a box office dud. It was originally released in the one-lens Cinerama format, so the 16X9 lops off the (usually unimportant) side ""panels"" of the screen, so you're not missing any of the main action.

There are, however,  a couple of (still) jawdropping big set pieces, such as the sinking of a ship in a harbor with what appears to be the entire cast of humans and caged animals on deck, all done, of course, without the usually easy to spot CGI effects. (Hathaway, like Raoul Walsh, was infamous for putting his cast through the wringer, and these virtuoso turns don't dissapoint).

Overall entertaining fare for the entire family though there are long sequences of trite dialogue and soap opera style scenes which will bore the toddlers. Also, there's no chemistry between any of the principals: John Smith seems terribly bored in his love scenes with Cardinale. The latter seems stuck there because she was a hot European ""import"" at a time when America had fallen in love - if ever so briefly - with foreign films. So, I suspect this is mainly of interest to nostalgia fans who remember the last days of movies as inoffensive entertainment.",1347753600,2,2130,4.597368421052631

He's the Barnum of a early 20th century circus, a former rodeo performer and Wild West show star, haunted by a past tragedy that comes to light as the story unfolds. This is his only film with Rita Hayward, Claudia Cardinale, and Lloyd Nolan, so definitely not the usual cast. It's also the last, I believe, of the Samual Bronston films, is directed by Henry Hathaway, and the music is by Dimitri Tiomkin, so it's loaded with many pluses as well as a good story and performances.",1331769600,,622,4.370689655172414

If you truly like John Wayne, you will enjoy this one! It does lose some of the Cinerama effect - after all, you don't have 3 huge screens to show it on - but it still delivers the fun excitement & great performances.

Today there are not as many circus's as in the old days so it was refreshing to see such wonderful performers. John Wayne is his usual self so if you enjoy his acting you won't be disappointed. Claudia Cardinale graces the screen with her beauty so there is something for everyone to enjoy here. This movie really needs to be added to every John Wayne collection.

It is not typical John Wayne fair, but the Duke always delivers a fine performance in his movies, regardless of the subject matter.  Rita Hayworth's performance, while good, was not one of her best, either.  She usually plays the spitfire image.  However, perhaps because she is older here, she is much more subdued.

Granted it is better than nothing, since this specific title is NOT available in the United States...why is that I ask?  I grew up watching John Wayne thru out my childhood with my Dad and LOVE his movies, now my son is growing up watching all of his films that I can get my hands on.  John Wayne films are classic and they should be produced in the United States, and be available to everyone young and old alike.
There is only one ""DUKE"".  Circus World is a classic, yes it is totally different than his usual cowboy movies, but so is Hatari and many others, every one of them Wonderful!  If you have never seen Circus World you're missing out, there is another version available now that is suppose to be a lot easier to view with the ability of subtitles being turned off.

It sounds like the applause is canned and down as well and some of the conversations are the same when they are conducted within the circus tent area.  The message of the movie was very good and I enjoyed it.  The problem with the sound I am sure was with the original movie and not any fault of the company that shipped it out.

382052,4,6301959949,"Circus World has joined the ranks of the much under-rated, and now mostly forgotten, epic films of
the late producer Samuel Bronson who worked magic in Spain during the 1960's with films such as
El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire.  Circus World is an epic told on that scale and cut from the
same cloth.  It features fine performances from John Wayne, in one of his last films, the beautiful young
Claudia Cardinale, and, of course, Rita Hayworth in one of her final good performances, near the end
of her illustrious career.  I bought this particular DVD to see Rita in one of her last performances, but
it is the strong screen presence of John Wayne that really carries the film.  Claudia Cardinale does a fine
job too with a role near the beginning of her career.  While Circus World has been compared unfavorably
by some to DeMille's Greatest Show On Earth, of a decade earlier, I feel that it stands-up well in the
genre of back-stage stories of the entertainment world.  Circus World has everything to entertain and
interest the viewer, even those not especially interested in the Circus per se.  It has a good story of a
mother-daughter estrangement and reconcillation, human drama of a career comeback, the trials and
tribulations of producing the great circus show, including the climax of coping with a spectacular fire
under the ""big tent"".  The story builds as it moves along and the third act resolves the story problem
with great poignancy for all concerned.  Circus World proves that producer Samuel Bronston could still
deliver a dramatic story on an epic scale and that such venerable performers as Wayne and Hayworth
could still deliver magnetic performances.",1276128000,5,1682,4.832752613240418

382076,4,6301959949,"Shot twelve years after Cecil B. De Mille immortalized the Ringling Bros - Barnum & Bailey Circus, Circus World does not clear the bar that De Mille established for circus movies. That does not mean it's a bad movie; simply that it's not of the same caliber.

The plot: Matt Masters (John Wayne), a Wild West circus star in the mold of Buffalo Bill Cody, bought a bankrupt show in 1885 and successfully rebuilt it into a combination three ring and Wild West extravaganza, mixing Wild West Show acts with conventional circus acts in a winning combination. He has successfully toured the United States for more than a decade. Now that the century is about to turn, he wants to take his show to Europe.

Cap Carson, his Circus Boss (the same position occupied by Brad Braden in The Greatest Show on Earth), played by the great character actor Lloyd Nolan, is against taking the show across the pond. He maintains that Europe is bad luck for American circuses. (This enables me to place the year; the first American show to successfully tour Europe was Barnum & Bailey in 1897.) He also calls Matt on his reason for making the tour: Masters wants to find the lost great love of his life, Lili Alfredo, and figures that this tour will smoke her out - if for no other reason than to see her child, Toni Alfredo (Claudia Cardinale), Masters' adopted daughter. One of his Western stars and wannabe-partner, Steve McCabe (John Smith), also attempts to dissuade Masters, but to no avail. Masters buys a freighter, renames her the Circus Maximus, and the show sails for Europe.

At Lisbon, the first port of call, the Circus Maximus capsizes at the pier and puts the show in the cart. Masters has to release most of his performers, board out his animals, and go back to performing an act for the Ed Purdy Wild West Show, a staple on the European circus circuit. Down but not out, Masters doesn't waste the disaster. ""While touring Europe at Ed Purdy's expense,"" as Masters puts it, he, Cap, Steve and Toni scout acts that will enable Masters to relaunch the Matt Masters Circus bigger and better than ever. The movie concentrates on three acts.

The first is Emile, a French animal trainer who has a spectacular act involving lions who lie down on him in the ring. Masters offers to take him on - if he'll switch from lions to tigers (Masters has many tigers but few lions). The trainer is adamant that he does not want to change to working with tigers; his wife persuades him to do so. By the time the circus is ready to relaunch, Emile is demanding that Masters hire a doctor for ""HIS tigers."" The dynamic of the trainer working with the animals is delightful to see.

The second is Jojo the Clown and the Wire-Dancing Ballerina (Richard Conte and Katharyna respectively). They have a unique act; Jojo is dressed as a clown but walks the high wire over a cage full of lions while coaching the Ballerina (his daugher Giovanna) as she dances on the wire. Backstage, Masters discovers that Jojo is an old acquaintace - Aldo, brother-in-law of Lili Alfredo, his lost love. Despite his reservations at hiring a possible enemy Masters takes the act on, and neither he nor Aldo admit to Toni - Aldo's niece - that they have met before.

The third is Maria, an artist of the high trapeze, coincidentally where Toni wants to work instead of in the Wild West show or as part of Clown Alley, where Matt has her working in the show. In reality, Maria is the vanished Lili Alfredo (Rita Hayworth), ridden by the guilt of having been caught up in a love triangle, blaming herself for the death of her flyer husband who had fallen - or did he miss Aldo's catch on purpose? - after learning of the love triangle. She had run away from the world of the circus and kept on running, finding solace first in the Church and then in the bottle.

As Masters had hoped, the lure of her daughter brought Lili out of hiding. She speaks to her daughter during a performance of Ed Purdy's Wild West Show without identifying herself, and Masters spots her. The two have an intense confrontation in a bar, ending with Masters slamming a full bottle of gin down in front of Lili and telling her that she needs to decide whether the booze or her child is more important to her - but that if she doesn't clean up her act, as far as he's concerned she is dead to him. Lili does in fact quit drinking and goes into training to seek a position in the new Matt Masters Circus, then in winter quarters near Lisbon.

Meanwhile, Toni has fallen for Steve and he for her, despite a difference in their ages of at least a decade. Matt has to come to terms with the fact that his adopted little girl is a woman grown, with a mind of her own. ""Maria's"" reappearance helps, and she is secretly amused by Toni's attempts to pair her off with Matt. Matt's doing pretty well on his own, as Toni observes with pleasure. She loves her adopted father and wants him to be happy.

Inevitably, the truth comes out (helped along by a push from Aldo, though it's never stated he's the perpetrator). The afternoon of the dress rehearsal, with Masters demanding of his performers the same show they will put on for the season-opening show in Vienna that evening, Toni finds a poster of The Flying Alfredos in her wagon living quarters with ""Suicide"" daubed on it in red. She also finds a newspaper clipping of the Flying Alfredos that lets her identify ""Maria"" as her mother, Lili Alfredo. There is a stormy confrontation with many passionate, hateful words on Toni's part between her, Lili and Matt; and Matt has to tell her that he was the second man in the love triangle. Toni curses both of them and runs out, just before a bugle call summons the show to Dress Rehearsal.

The rehearsal opens to empty seats with Grand Parade, with the performers marching in  behind the flags of the nations whose citizens are in the show: the United States, Great Britain, France, Imperial Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Italy and more. Partway through Grand Parade, a fire breaks out in Wardrobe and spreads to the Big Top. Fast action by Lili, Matt, Steve, Toni, Cap and Aldo prevents injury to the circus performers and manages to save about half of the tent from the flames. The one positive thing to come out of the fire is a rapprochement between Toni and Lili.

Matt somehow obtains permission from the Emperor to set up his show in the grounds of the Imperial Palace. The show is a smash success, with a new act headlining: Lili and Toni Alfredo, performing a swing-over routine fifty feet in the air. (Circus buffs will recognize it as the routine Lillian Leitzel performed once upon a time.) The movie ends with Matt, Lili, Toni and Matt's new partner and Toni's fiance, Steve, taking bows to the applause of the people and the Crown.

There seems to be a convention that in every circus movie, there has to be a Major Crisis That Threatens The Show. In The Greatest Show on Earth, it was a train wreck; The Big Circus had the death of a flyer and the advent of television that kept people at home instead of under the Big Top; Man on a Tightrope had trigger-happy border guards and Communist commissars; The Big Show featured a grasping, greedy, scheming son who betrays his wife, brothers and father to get control of the show. Circus World has its main top fire. Although tent fires are certainly not unknown in circus history this one felt a whole lot contrived because it wasn't pinned on anyone, even though Aldo certainly had a grudge against both Lili and Matt and thus the motivation. It's just too coincidental for my taste, right there and right then in the plot.

However, this movie is worth watching for its taking the viewer behind the scenes, showing how the performers work up new acts, how performing in an arena is very different from performing under canvas, and how the Governor goes about selecting acts to present a well-balanced show. It's by no means as important a film as The Greatest Show On Earth, and you may feel as I do that the ending is contrived. As against that, Henry Hathaway did a very good job of capturing the feeling of the circus as a family that De Mille didn't really grasp in his Oscar-winning picture. If you like circuses, you'll find this film worthwhile and won't feel your time watching it was wasted. Besides, Rita Hayworth and Claudia Cardinale in tights are worth looking at any time.

As I said, it's not a bad picure; it just is not a great one.",1274572800,3,8458,4.540682414698162

382119,4,6301959949,"Circus World (1964) This was the last of the epic sized movies produced by Samuel Bronston (The Fall of the Roman Empire) at his Madrid Studios before he declared bankruptcy. It was also a tough year for star John Wayne as he was diagnosed with lung cancer and had the lung removed! Still in all, none of this is visible onscreen in this big budget story: at the turn of the twentieth century, circus owner Matt Masters (John Wayne) takes his circus on a tour to Europe in search of his long-lost love, Lili Alfredo (Rita Hayworth). With him are Lili's daughter, Toni (Claudia Cardinale) whom she abandoned years earlier and whom Matt has raised as his own, and his faithful friend, Cap Carson (Lloyd Nolan). Things don't go well, starting with the sinking of the ship that brings them to Europe, costing them much of their personnel and equipment, but nothing can keep Matt from finding Lili and reuniting her with Toni. This is a solid, old fashioned drama that they just don't make any more, with the big budget used well. Wayne is his usual stalwart self, which is amazing considering his health issues that year, and he gets terrific support from the entire cast, but especially from Cardinale, vivacious as the lively Toni. The other standout is Hayworth, who also had real life health issues that help bring gravitas to her sad character. If you like the good old movies they used to show on Saturdays and Sundays on your local channels, here's one I recommend. Also with Richard Conte (Ocean's 11).",1229817600,20,1506,4.686792452830189
