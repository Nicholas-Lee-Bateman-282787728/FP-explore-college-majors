8307166,5,B001GTZZD6,"Would you like this DVD?  Probably not if you are  looking for a professionally produced travelogue.

But IF you long to take the Trans-Siberian, as I do, this is useful DVD.  There isn't much video out there about this route. Yes it's essentially a home movie - but what a home movie, carefully researched and organized.

With this DVD you get to go along on the most elaborate cross-Russia that the pre-eminently classy MIR Travel has to offer.  Starting west of Moscow and going to Vladivostok and beyond into the wilderness to the north-with many add-ons throughout.  You get a feel for being on the tour: the sights, hanging out on the train, cramped corners, lots of down time, fellow travelers, varied excursions. For less than $10, I sampled a trip that could cost $100K for a couple on MIR. I wanted to thank the authors for putting it together.",1370304000,,854,4.653333333333333
8307167,4,B001GTZZD6,This Trans Siberian DVD is a charming account of a couple's trip on the railroad.  It provides interesting information about places to stop off and visit on the way through the countries of Russia and Mongolia.  We enjoyed the ride and the historical background.  It is very much a couple's home movie of their adventure - not a Steven Spielberg!,1300752000,2,346,4.733333333333333
8307168,2,B001GTZZD6,"This was one of those times when Amazon did not provide enough information to make a choice.  I was trying to buy the DVD of a movie that took place on the Trans-Siberian.  Instead, I bought somebody else's home movies.  Not what I wanted, so no way could I be satisfied with the outcome.",1265760000,2,288,4.296296296296297
8307169,2,B001GTZZD6,I expected this to be about the trans siberian railroad. It was really a traveloge and had very little to do with the railroad other than as transportation.,1252713600,4,156,4.607142857142857
