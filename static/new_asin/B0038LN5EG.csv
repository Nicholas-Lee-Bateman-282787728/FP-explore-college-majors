4712373,5,B0038LN5EG,Intense. Real. Gripping. Relatable. Well written. Visually captivating. This is a wonderful indie flick that pulls you in and really captures the struggles of a family affected by drugs abuse. I found myself relating to its characters and their emotional battles which is always a tell tale sign of an amazing film.  This movie definitely pulls on your heartstrings and you come away with the feeling that you've been let in on something very personal and also thinking about how you would feel and act if this story was actually your life. Bravo to everyone involved in this movie!!!,1286841600,,584,4.898989898989899

When we have an opportunity to see other people's stories, it is a very special thing. I highly recommend watching and listening to this story.",1429488000,,319,5.037735849056604
8475506,5,B0038LN5EG,"We can all relate to the differing experiences of siblings, and this film envelopes you with its vision of one family.  The characters are brought together, from extremes of steadfast loyalty and adventurous escapism, to pick up the pieces of their shared past.  Memories return, the kind which make your chest ache and put a lump in your throat and make you want to scream and cry at the same time.  I found it effortless to get into the emotions portrayed, as though I were right there, like an unseen little brother, following Alyssa Lobit as Emmie into scenes both heart breaking and beautiful.  Open a bottle of wine, and enjoy a film that might make you want to call your family and catch up.",1300665600,,698,4.56
8475507,5,B0038LN5EG,"I have never written a review for amazon before but this movie affected me so much, I absolutely had to write one! Being an Asian American woman, there were just so many things I could relate to in the movie.  It was a very emotional movie, don't forget the tissue box!",1300060800,,269,4.2745098039215685
8475508,5,B0038LN5EG,"Truly an amazing movie. The Things We Carry is an independent film about Emmie (Alyssa Lobit) returning back home from traveling around Asia to hear her drug addict of a mother, Sunny, has died. As the film goes on, we learn of Emmie's volatile relationship with her mother and older sister. The flashbacks of Emmie and Sunny's relationship frequent blowups were disturbingly candid. Practically everyone can relate to this movie because of that familiar sense hopelessness when we watch our loved ones destroying themselves (like in this movie, with drugs). All we want to do is help them, but in such a way that reassures them that they are not in this life alone, and shouldn't resume destroying themselves.
What I loved the most about this movie is that it covers an Asian- American family (Korean) where generally having a mental disorder or anything out of the 'ordinary' is never spoken of. If it is mentioned, people gossip about it. I don't understand why it's not allowed to say, ""Hey, I have a mother suffering such a mental disorder and is under the influence of drugs. Please STOP exacerbating this issue by gossiping about her!"" More movies should talk more about these issues, rather than ignoring it. The movies out there now is about partying and sex. Life isn't all about that; there are people in this world who are struggling with a mental disorder or drugs, but are never covered just because it's such a deep and taboo topic. Well, why? Many who know someone close to them suffering from a disorder can agree that one of the ways to deal with such an immense issue is talking about it. If no one is talking about it, how can we help them?
Hey, everyone has family problems and this film does such a great job of conveying our often irrational blowups with our loved ones. We should all take great care in DIRECTLY showing love to our families. My heart goes out to those with family members who are disabled, have mental disorders, etc; you have such a kind, patient, and great heart.  This film really made me think about all my arguments I've had with my family members and how dumb they are compared to the arguments in this movie.

Great movie, 5/5 stars, and definitely recommended to everyone!",1299888000,,2221,4.67774936061381
8475509,5,B0038LN5EG,I saw this movie at the Boston Asian American Film Festival and fell in love with it right away.

8475511,5,B0038LN5EG,"The Things We Carry is a brilliant display of acting and screen writing. The story is captivating and will keep you intrigued until the end. All of the characters are well thought out and the acting (from EVERYONE) is amazing. Literally. It's great to see a drama with two female leads, although this movie is by no means a chick flick. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys truly great films.",1288742400,,391,4.52112676056338

The characters a richly developed, the script is punctuated with poignant emotional moments, which are expertly executed through the on-screen performances. It's what every dramatic film hopes to be - beautiful, bittersweet, and cathartic.",1288742400,,314,5.5625
8475514,4,B0038LN5EG,"If this movie were Hollywood-ized, it would have been terrible, forgettable, and a flash in the pan. Luckily, the creative team behind this movie stuck to their guns and made a genuine film about grief and two sisters trying to reconnect. What sticks out most is the realism aspect of the drama. A couple minor flaws here and there, but overall it's a beautiful piece and highly recommend you watch it. :-)",1288742400,,406,4.652777777777778
