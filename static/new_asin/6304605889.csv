927093,5,6304605889,"This new version is almost a satire of a satire.  The enhanced special 3d effects serve to better mock the new release from Lucasfilm, but fail to be seamlessly integrated for a wonderful twist.  At less than ten bucks it's  an easy choice.  May the farce be with you...",913161600,,270,4.448979591836735
927295,2,6304605889,Kinda funny as satire or a spoof.  Bear in mind it was created in 1977. Free if you have Amazon Prime,1457308800,,101,3.8095238095238093
927296,2,6304605889,Cheesy. It had entertainment value and ingenuity in recreating the Star Wars film but didn't hold my attention. Not something I'd spend money to watch,1457222400,,150,5.04

927418,2,6304605889,"If you watched this as a kid like I did, it has some nostalgic value. I remember watching this when I was young and thinking it was hysterical. I no longer hold that opinion. It's really badly made. The production quality is a step below bad 70's porn.

The story is hard to follow. The acting is awful. The special effects are insanely bad.

Yet every now and then you see a toaster flying and it reminds you of how much you laughed at this when you were 7 and it brings a smile to your face. Then someone talks and the smile goes away.

It's worth a watch if you'd seen it as a kid for no other reason than its' funny to see how much your tastes have changed. If you've never seen it before, it's probably not going to interest you. If you're just desperate for a Star Wars parody, it's call Space Balls. Stop messing around and go watch that instead.",1453420800,,853,4.157575757575757

927424,4,6304605889,"Released before ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was even shot, ""Hardware Wars"" could possibly be the first fanfilm that saw serious circulation among audiences.  Instead of a short spoof of the original ""Star Wars"", ""Hardware Wars"" plays out like an extended trailer for a spoof of ""Star Wars"".  It's goofy, cheesy, and horribly dated.

In the DVD, there are a lot of extras, and they may actually be funnier than the movie itself, which is not really a movie but a trailer for a movie that was never made. That is, it is scripted as if it was a trailer.

As in all good satire, the names are well chosen: Fluke Starbucker, Auggie ""Ben"" Doggie, Ham Salad, Princess Anne Droid (whose hairdo includes two huge buns -- the bakery type), the Wookie Monster, and the evil Darph Nader. The spaceships are household appliances, the robots are a tin-man costume from Oz and a canister vacuum cleaner.

928794,3,6304605889,"For the film itself, I would give 5 stars.  But the packaging is misleading, listing several things that you honestly don't get:

1. ""A rare look at a pirated version from 1979"": Nope.  They just took the film and dubbed some other language over it as a joke.

2. ""The never-seen-before director's cut"": Nope.  They just threw a bunch of extra footage together, such as outtakes, and left the existing soundtrack.  For example, you'll see a certain scene repeat multiple times (because the outtakes are now included), but the soundtrack remains the same, so as you are watching one scene, you may be hearing the next.  Not a director's cut by any stretch of the imagination.

3. ""The shooting script and other original work by Ernie Fosselius"": I looked all over the disc for this -- there MIGHT be a picture of part of the script on one screen, but that's it.  You do not get the script.  Not here.  Sorry.

Oh, and the commentary track is a joke.  Instead of actually talking about the film, and answering questions that fans have had for years (such as ""Who were these people"", ""How did he get them to be in this film"", and ""Why such bad hair?""), Fosselius just goofs off the entire time, saying absolutely nothing of interest (or humor for that matter).  Great film Ernie, but horrible, horrible commentary, you naughty person!

Recommended for the film itself, but not for any of the things the packaging promises you that you don't acutally get.  How about some truth in advertising?",1120435200,17,1489,4.6692307692307695
928795,5,6304605889,"If Star Wars inspired a generation of kids to become film directors, Hardware Wars probably inspired them to just get on with it. Although it was really a professional production made to look cheesy, HW in fact has a wonderful DIY, indie vibe to it. Seeing an iron fly overhead on wires is the film equivalent of the famous ""Here's three chords; go start a band"" zine page from the early days of punk rock.

And dang if it isn't still funny. Most of the jokes hold up, and a few have even improved with age (""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss three bucks goodbye"" now elicits a nostalgic snort in a world where 1977's ticket prices buy a gallon of gas today).

HW on DVD is definitely worth the money--you get a bunch of oddball additions, including Ernie on a local cable show in 1980 obstensibly talking about the movie but just kinda going off on some goofy comedy (oh, and he IS involved with this rerelease, unlike the Special Edition version a few years ago; his stamp is all over it!). Some of the additions like the director's cut fell flat for me, but humor is subjective.

My only complaint is that I greedily would have liked to get the Special Edition version on there, too, but it is MIA. Since the DVD only runs an hour, certainly there was room, but perhaps since it was done without Ernie's input, it got canned.

928797,4,6304605889,"Not long after George Lucas' original ""Star Wars"" film took theaters throughout the world by storm in 1977, a very silly 13-minute long parody entitled ""Hardware Wars"" was filmed in 1978 by writer/director Ernie Fosselius.  The parody, designed as a long film trailer, replaces the authentic special effects and models used in ""Star Wars"" with low-budget replacements, mostly in the form of household appliances.  For example, the Lucas' Millenium Falcon in ""Hardware Wars"" is an electric iron, the Death Star is a waffle iron, an imperial cruiser is an electric mixer, and the squat droid R2-D2 becomes a canister vacuum cleaner called ""Artee-Deco"".  As with Artee-Deco, the other characters from Lucas' ""Star Wars"" are transformed in ""Hardware Wars"" as follows: C3PO becomes 4-Q-2 (like the tin-man from the 1939 ""The Wizard of Oz""), Han Solo becomes Ham Salad (Bob Knickerbocker), Chewbacca becomes the Muppet-like Chucilla (similar to the ""Sesame Street"" cookie monster), Princess Leia becomes Princess Anne-Droid (Cindy Furgatch, who wears round rolls on the sides of her head), Luke Skywalker becomes Fluke Starbucker (Scott Mathews), Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi becomes Augie 'Ben' Doggie (Jeff Hale) and Darth Vader becomes Darf Nader, who is impossible to understand due to his welding-style helmet.

Clearly, not everyone who watches ""Hardware Wars"" finds it funny; but for most sci-fi aficionados, it's totally priceless!  One of my favorite scenes is the equivalent of the demonstration of how powerful the Death Star is: instead of blowing up the planet of Alderan, it blows up the planet of Basketball (a literal basketball).  Equally ridiculous and funny is the intentionally bad and sometimes melodramatic acting. Of course, you don't want to miss the exciting special effects of ""dyna-space"", as presented in ""Hardware Wars"".  Consequently, for being a completely hilarious spoof of ""Star Wars"" filmed on a meager budget of $8,000, I rate ""Hardware Wars"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It is interesting to note that Ernie Fosselius provided some voice work and some other miscellaneous work in Lucas' 1983 film ""Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi"".  Clearly, George Lucas was not upset with Fosselius' parody.",1107043200,26,2215,5.305714285714286

928802,4,6304605889,"This short Star Wars parody looks like it was a lot of fun to make. It has an amateurish exuberance that makes you want to go out and make a movie yourself. The guy doing the Luke Skywalker parody is especially goofy. Though the main idea is so good--household appliances filling in for the techno-wizard spaceships and stuff in Star Wars--that it is sometimes hard for the parody to out-do its premise. But most of the jokes are really funny, and the naive exuberance it exhibits all the way through contrasts with the sort of jaded, burnt-out professionalism of the latest installments from the actual, seemingly interminable Star Wars saga.
Some of the other features on the DVD are good, too. There is a funny antiques road show parody, and listening to Michael Wiese speak at Cannes gives an unusual insight into trying to break in in Hollywood.

928845,5,6304605889,"It's great to finally see a classic like Hardware Wars out on DVD in its original form.  I remember watching this film many times as a kid when they'd show Hardware Wars between movies on HBO as I was waiting for Smokey and Bandit 3 to come on.  I was as engrossed with the Hardware Wars DVD as when I first saw Hardware Wars over 20 years ago -- the timeless special effects and the antics of Artie Deco and 4-Q-2 never get old.  In fact, as I kid I was such a big fan of 4-Q-2 that my parents wanted me to stop saying his name in the house.  I've been a big fan of the Star Wars films for 25 years and Hardware Wars will always be
the original and ultimate parody even a quarter century later.
The best reason to get this DVD are all the exciting Extras thrown in. The ""Foreign"" version of Hardware Wars is even funnier than the original, and proves once and for all that Darph Nader is impossible to understand in any language.  Star Wars collectors will love the interview with Ernie Fosselius, the director of Hardware Wars, where he describes the merchandising behind the film including the highly-coveted coupon for the
Early Bird Kit for the Hardware Wars action figures.  I was stunned to see all the lost footage painstakingly restored in the Director's Cut, which is a must for any fan who has seen Hardware Wars many times over.  It's a great package packed with many surprises and an essential part of any Star Wars fan's DVD collection.",1024704000,18,1450,4.388059701492537
928846,5,6304605889,"When a little film called Star Wars came upon an unsuspecting public in 1977, few people took notice.  When Hardware Wars was released on the same unsuspecting public a year later, all hell broke loose.
I'm kidding, of course.
Star Wars became a phoenomenon all its own, Hardware Wars became a legendary parody in no time flat. Our local public library must have gone through half a dozen 16mm prints of this film under the distribution of Prism Films. Warner Home Video was able secure the film for a home video release in the late '70's but the video went out of print, while the short gathered mythical status, not unlike Star Wars itself.  When Micheal Wiese made the effort to issue an expanded special edition to again lampoon the Star Wars Special Edition, reaction was mixed.  Wiese and director Ernie Fosselius pulled out all the stops to make the DVD experience one worthy of the original.  You'll kiss more than three bucks goodbye for this DVD, but it will be worth every penny.  Just like Fluke Starbucker, intergalactic boy-wonder, you'll find yourself exclaiming ""Wow...Wowee...Jeepers...Golly Willickers!""",1024272000,2,1121,5.005376344086022
928847,4,6304605889,"""Hardware Wars"" is the all-time most successful spoof of a movie. Released in 1978 to capitalize on the enormous popularity of the original Star Wars movie, the demented minds behind this 10 minute short decided to follow up the movie's Special Edition re-release with a Special Edition of their own. Complete with 20 new special 'defects', ""Hardware Wars"" takes us to 'another part of the galaxy, later that same day' and regales us with the tale of Fluke Starbucker, Princess Anne-Droid, Ham Salad, and Chewchilla (the Wookie Monster). Not only is ""Hardware Wars"" the most successful spoof of all time, it's also, hands down, the funniest. There's a scene where venerable Red-Eye Knight, Augie Ben Daugie falls back in his clutching his forehead and Fluke says ""What's wrong Augie Ben Daugie? Did millions of voices cry out in pain and suddenly were silenced?.. to which Augie replies ""nah, it's just a little headache"". To get a broader idea of the off-beat sense of humor, the R2-D2 equivalent is a vacuum cleaner called Artie-Deco. C-3PO's alter-ego is a carbon copy of the Tin Man from ""Wizard of Oz"" and his name is 4-Q-2 (think about it). This type of on-the-mark parody is often strived for, but seldom realized. ""Hardware Wars"" hits the bullseye. You'll laugh, You'll Cry, You'll kiss three bucks goodbye. But, at least it will be well spent.",1023148800,3,1352,4.908296943231441
928848,5,6304605889,"As a fan of sound effects and funny voices, I was 7 when I saw Hardware Wars for the first time. I don't even remember if it was on HBO or what. But it's brilliant. It just proves for not a lot of money you can make something lasting and funny and just as good as the multi-million dollar comedies. Beats the hell out of the Simpsons!",1022803200,2,334,4.0
928849,5,6304605889,"The first time I saw Hardware Wars was in college a couple of years after its release on video. Thinking back, I don't remember laughing as much as I did at that grainy video. Since those experiences are seldom as funny later in life, I watched the DVD with a little trepidation but found that I laughed as much, if not more. Ernie Fosselius and Michael Wiese managed to add just the right elements to make this DVD a bit more contemporary by adding the director's cut and commentary while, at the same time, retaining the corny charm of the original production.
The artistic value of Hardware Wars is not in its glitzy, hi-tech effects but rather, in the fact that the effects are intentionally low tech.  If you think about it, a toaster hanging from an obvious fishing line and being attacked by an iron really shouldn't be that funny, but the contrast to the slick, hi-tech Star Wars is precisely what makes it so funny. And yes, ""you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss three bucks goodby!""

928850,5,6304605889,"The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally out on DVD.  HW has earned its niche among parody classics and is not only a riotous little 20 minute short but a staple in low budget film production classes, which is where a lot of the film's cult status is derived from and resides.  With the DVD, not only do we get a chance to revisit the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, et al) that Ernie F. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material showcasing the Fosselius wit.  Antique Sideshow is a dead-on parody that is very funny but makes a statement about the confluence of ignorance and greed at the same time.  The Director's Commentary is also hysterical, as is the Creature Feature which parodies taking a film out on the talk-show circuit and actually IS based on taking HW out on the talk show circuit, albeit the public access circuit.  I'd love to see Ernie, Micael Wiese and crew take on some other, contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody -- like just about any film that Hollywood churns out at $100 million a pop these days -- not so much the crafty films like Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parodies themselves!) but any number of overblown, overhyped, overwrought and overpriced features.",1022112000,2,1253,4.703196347031963

Ernie's wit is sharp as ever.  First time around his idea was to parody Hollywood and their big budget special effects movies. Now, he's taken on the world of DVD's as well which needs a comedic wake-up call.  His Director's Commentary is a good natured swipe at all those precious director's commentaries.  Then, in the Antique Sideshow prequel to the film he reveals the true genesis of Star Wars.  There's lot of new cool stuff that he's provided on this DVD.
In addition, our old pal Luther Green went back into the studio with Ernie and redid the sound track into our own Digi Redo 8.0, so get ready for another level of fun.
Ernie is clearly one of the most creative satirists of our time!

928852,2,6304605889,"I remember hearing about this legendary short film back in my high school days in conversations with fellow Star Wars geeks. But it was only recently that I finally got to take a look at this silly take on our friend George's little far away galaxy from a long time ago. Unfortunately, I found my self rather disappointed-it wasn't really all that funny to me. But it did have a few redeeming qualities. There were plenty of the kinda campy & silly moments that you'd come to expect from such a project, complete with the most lowbrow special effects ever seen this side of classic Star Trek. Unfortunately these moments didn't come off as being all that entertaining to me, just downright dumb. And I thought turning Chewie into the Cookie Monster was a cute touch. Otherwise, I was less than impressed, and the laughs I expected to get from this show were nearly nonexistent.
But I'll admit that if I had my `druthers between `Hardware Wars' and the Star Wars Holiday Special, `HW' would get the nod every time. But if I had my `druthers between this and, say, `Spaceballs'-- well, that's a whole `nother story...

Well, let's see, Hardware Wars is 14 minutes long, and I laughed an average of three times per minute, so I guess that would make it ... pretty darn funny. This original SW parody is a trailer for a movie that never existed, which follows the adventures of Fluke Starbucker and Auggie ""Ben"" Doggie as they fly through space in a toaster with Ham Salad and Chewchilla the Wookie Monster to save Princess Anne-Droid from the evil Darph Nader-Ralph's cousin?  Every fan of Star Wars should see this at least once, as should Mel Brooks fans and anyone else who really enjoys silliness.

928925,5,6304605889,"Ok folks, Quiz Time: Question number 1: Take the most succesfull and one of the funniest short films ever made and add lots of new computer graphics.  What is the result? Is it A: Better, B:The samee or C: Worse. The shocking answer for Hardware Wars is ""C"" all the way.  Now Let me say this right off the bat, this is not a bad movie, in fact, its a wonderfull movie.  It is increadibly funny, entertaining, but all too short.  The Title of this review is to attract your attention to the new ""Special Defects"" which were ""Created withought the consut of Ernie Fosselus""  The basic idea is to take a wonderfull short and enhance it through new footage.  Sadley, the result is not very good.  The new computer graphics are pretty poor, by todays standards, they just look compleatly out of place, and they don't really enhance the film at all (Although the THX and Fox Logo spoofs work really well)  If they wanted to enhance the film, they should have added the origianal 20 minutes of cut footage (Which is unfortunitly not in this version)  But don't get me wrong, Hardware wars is still a wonderfull film to watch.  The acting is wonderfull, the narrator does an excellent job of narrating the entire thing.  And who can forget the antics of everybodys favorite, Chewchilla, the Wookie monster?  If you never have seen this classic go ahead and buy it anyway, you don't know what you are missing.  If you have already seen it however, this version dosent really add anything new.  Lets just hope they make a 3rd version that has the 20 minutes of cut footage added on.
The Good: Its Hardware Wars, Imensley entertaining, wonderfull box art, increadibly funny
The bad: new Special deffects are not really good, not much diffrent from the origianal

When we finally got to the end of the tape, I reached over and hit the eject button on my VCR.  My roommate said ""Aren't you going to rewind it?"", to which I replied ""Why bother?"", before picking the tape up, putting it back in its little sleeve and burying it in a drawer.

928931,3,6304605889,"My review is specifically about the ""Special Edition"" of ""Hardware Wars."" I was thrilled to see a video release of HW, as I have been a fan of the short since its original release (HBO used to show  it a lot way back when. I made a tape of it years ago, but lost it). But I  was apprehensive when I saw that this version was a digitally enhanced  ""Special Edition."" Sure enough, when the video arrived, it  carried a sticker on the case, reading:  ""Warning: This edition has  been created without the approval or consent of Eddie Fossellius."" I'm  just guessing, but I figured that Fossellius, the director of the original  HW, didn't care to have his short film ""enhanced,"" regardless of  the satirical intent. The folks who put together this ""Special  Edition"" make a valiant effort to use HW as a way to satirize Luca's  digitally enhanced Star Wars Special Edition Trilogy. Unfortunately, the  satire doesn't work, and, in some cases, the digital enhancements even  spoil the jokes of the original short film. Ironically some of the satire  falls flat because the digital effects are too good. In a short that is  celebrated for its intentional cheesiness, this is a major error.  Another  major problem, I think, is one of reference. For a lot of younger viewers,  this will be their first exposure to HW, so a lot of the attempted parody  of the HW ""Special Edition"" will be lost on them. I really think  it would have helped the humor of the ""Special Edition"" if the  distributors had included the original, untouched version of HW at the  beginning of the tape. To be fair, there are a couple of funny original  bits before and after the film, but they don't make up for the lost  opportunities on the film itself. If you're a fan of HW looking to own a  pristine copy of the original film, as I was, you'll probably be less than  satisfied, as I was, with this ""enhanced"" version.",960076800,130,1889,4.564179104477612
