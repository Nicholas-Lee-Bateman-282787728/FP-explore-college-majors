3741715,4,B001P80ZIS,"Shirley Henderson is a wonderful actress and I enjoy her work a great deal.  She has a way of making you feel her pain and you just want to reach out to her, try to help her.  It doesn't matter what the budget is when you have such fine acting from the entire cast.  It's not your average whodoneit but worth a watch.",1365984000,,317,4.0
3741716,1,B001P80ZIS,I really disliked this movie. It did have good actors but it did not live up to my expectations. I would not recomendation this movie.,1343001600,,134,4.4
3741717,1,B001P80ZIS,"I sat down to watch this movie.  And then it ended.  So I thought hard to remember how I spent the last 90 minutes of my life.  I remember beautiful and dreadful grey landscapes.  Lots of water and bubbles.  A doleful, solitary string instrument in the background.  The story of a girl trapped between this world and the next because of what happened to her sister, with imagery pretty much crammed into my eyes at every turn until even I was a little lost.

To begin with, Henderson comes off as child-like and clearly insane.  You don't know if she's genuine or genuinely schizo.  She's truly unconvincing as a girl who suffers and comes across as a little girl lost, or bored; it was hard to tell.  Does she need coffee?  Does she need a thicker coat, perhaps?  Does she need to take a nap?  I found the heroine distracting at best and kept wondering, ""What IS she doing?""  When the actor gets in the way of the story, then you know it's bad acting.  The acting was very numb and she didn't garner any sympathy from me.

All the male roles were...non-existent.  I know there were men cast in there!  Richard Armitage was in there for heaven's sake and though his acting is usually excellent, as is Roshan Seth's, they were so unmemorable!  Hastily introduced and poorly developed, the story line was literally a girl running around for 90 minutes with a few guys in the background.

The ending was really expected.  There was no redeeming, her, clearly.  But how it came about suddenly made me wonder how the heck I got to the end.",1313539200,6,1534,4.481884057971015
3741718,2,B001P80ZIS,"I'm into mystery movies however I just didn't get this one, totally lost interest within the first 10 minutes! Sorry I just can't think of something good to say about this movie...",1273795200,2,180,4.65625
3741719,4,B001P80ZIS,this is a great story. It's feels as though you don't have answers but you do. If you watch this movie then you need to pay attention to what certain characters say in the beginning and what they say in the end. Piece it all together and viola! you find out what happened to Annie. in the end I was shocked and satisfied with a good movie.,1264204800,13,339,4.074626865671642
3741720,5,B001P80ZIS,"This movie is amazing, really... Shirley Roshan is a wonderfull actress and Richard Armitage too... A strange and beautifull movie!",1257897600,5,131,5.6
3741721,2,B001P80ZIS,I really don't know what to say about this film other than I found it really odd. I didn't feel as though any plausible answers were given at the end and I was left wondering what the heck it had all been about. Very very odd film.,1253750400,11,231,3.9361702127659575
3741722,4,B001P80ZIS,"Shirley Henderson has cornered the market when it comes to playing the emotionally fragile waif and here she uses her talent to good effect in a small film that punches well above its weight. Frozen is wistful, dreamlike, and solidly unpretentious. Kathy's obsessive search for her missing sister Annie becomes increasingly elegiac as she discovers that Annie disappeared in the `dead ground' between two surveillance cameras. This blind spot becomes a portal into another place, where she glimpses her sister. There are no flashy special effects here, just grey urban landscapes and melancholic shots of the mudflats of Morecombe Bay. In fact describing his movie does little to do it justice as its simple style belies its enigmatic charm. If you have to have car chases and shoot-outs in order to enjoy a movie Frozen is not for you, but if you appreciate a thoughtful study of pain and loss you should enjoy this film.",1252627200,30,922,4.95483870967742
3741733,2,B001P80ZIS,depressing movie. don't waste your time.,1405123200,,40,5.833333333333333
3741734,2,B001P80ZIS,"I don't know what everyone is talking about. I rented this for my grandchildren who were begging to see it. But there are no princesses; this is NOT an animated adventure; and I never heard ""Let it Go"". Not once.",1404604800,2,212,4.325
3741735,4,B001P80ZIS,"Like so many others, I watched this movie simply because Richard Armitage was in it.  I had also seen Shirley Henderson before.  Although the movie started very slowly, and I wasn't quite sure what was going on...was she having weird visions?  Dreams?...I did enjoy Richard's performance...it was easily the best performance in the movie.  The end went quite fast, and I wasn't quite sure how she had figured it out, or even if she really had figured it out.  Overall, it was worthwhile to watch.",1401580800,,496,4.788235294117647
3741736,5,B001P80ZIS,I enjoyed it very much. I wished it had more Richard Armitage in it but it was still very good movie. I hope to have everything he plays in.,1401148800,3,140,3.8620689655172415
3741737,1,B001P80ZIS,You sent the wrong one!!!!!!!!!!!  So I sent it back  When do I get my credit back???????????? I have nothing more to say.,1399593600,2,122,4.260869565217392
3741738,3,B001P80ZIS,I thought this was well done.  It's not as much a mystery as it is about the impact of grief on a somewhat fragile psyche.  The main actress (Shirley Henderson) really captures an unraveling emotional state.  I really loved the vicar (Shireen Shah) as well and the scenes between the two of them.,1398211200,,296,4.547169811320755
3741739,3,B001P80ZIS,"I enjoyed the movie, however, the end froze
I haven't contacted the retailer so I don't really know how they would take care of that (or if they would at all).\
so....there you go",1398124800,,179,4.294117647058823
3741740,4,B001P80ZIS,"Admittedly, I watched this because Richard Armitage was in it, and rewound his scenes several times.  If you like plot driven slow shows then you might enjoy this.",1397260800,,163,4.821428571428571
3741741,2,B001P80ZIS,Not much of a plot but the acting was pretty good.  I thought it was weak overall.  I only watched it because I like Richard Armstrong.,1397088000,,135,4.153846153846154
3741742,4,B001P80ZIS,Story was a little slow but good. Was not enough of my favorite actor Richard Armitage but well worth seeing. The ending was a surprise.,1395187200,,136,4.48
3741773,2,B001P80ZIS,Wanted to rent the Walt Disney Frozen-- wound up with this by mistake. Was not interested in this plot at all,1393977600,,109,4.238095238095238
3741774,1,B001P80ZIS,"My bad purchase.
I thought I was renting the Disney Frozen movie.
Did not look closely at the description of the movie.",1393804800,2,119,4.454545454545454
3741775,1,B001P80ZIS,This movie steps beyond an examination of grief into the paranormal.  I didn't prefer it.  The story line was lame. . .,1393545600,,119,4.363636363636363
3741776,2,B001P80ZIS,"Haven't watched it all yet. Maybe if I give it more attention it will get better? I think the acting was okay,",1393545600,,110,4.045454545454546
3741777,2,B001P80ZIS,"Good story, good psychological thriller, but a bit slow and boring. The acting was phenomenal. Well filmed and well done but not good enough.",1389744000,,141,4.916666666666667
3741778,1,B001P80ZIS,"In my opinion this film had no point. It is dark and depressing, and you never really understand what is going on. My family and I have what we call ""the fifteen minute rule"". This means, if after fifteen minutes the film is still boring, or uninteresting we stop watching it. I did not follow this rule this time, and I should have. I primarily watched it to see the actor Richard Armitage. He is in it for such a short time that it isn't worth watching just for him. Shirley Henderson's performance, was strange, but well acted for the crazy character she plays. I would not recommend this film.",1388448000,,597,4.4363636363636365
3741779,4,B001P80ZIS,"So, got this one because RA is in it, and found it to be a quirky little film.  I can see where people have found it confusing, though I found it to be an interesting study of how one deals (or not so much) with unexplained loss.  It's definitely not a mainstream type film, so if you're into that, this is not the movie for you.  I liked it.",1380931200,6,342,3.927536231884058
3741780,5,B001P80ZIS,STORY WAS A GREAT CLIFF HANGER RIGHT UP TO THE END.  GREAT PERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF SHIRLEY HENDERSON. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,1378425600,,124,4.904761904761905
3741781,3,B001P80ZIS,I love the temperature of this movie...but wished for a more resolute and slower climax...spent so much time on the beginning that the end felt rushed and empty....,1375056000,,164,4.892857142857143
3741782,3,B001P80ZIS,It was an interesting movie. The main character lost her sister two years ago and she sets off to find where she went long after everyone else quits looking for her. The movie follows her into her insanity as she gets closer to the truth. In the end she meets the same fate.,1372896000,,274,4.188679245283019
8332465,2,B001P80ZIS,"Thin plot and characters but well-acted low budget thriller, which is hard to find.",1465776000,,83,5.0
8332466,3,B001P80ZIS,"I found the film  a depressing trip into the mind of a poor soul who has lost her sister.
Several twists in the story were really exciting.",1455580800,,139,4.148148148148148
8332467,3,B001P80ZIS,"Rather all over the place. Henderson still seeks her departed sister. Seth tries to get through to her, even risking his professional standings. The former's sister's disappearance leaves many holes void. It's been a long time since I had seen this one, to be honest. And yet, it is called FROZEN for a reason. The lead is ""frozen"" in the past; the therapist tries to split the ""ice"" apart. As he knows, we the audience know ""the ice is not thin."" Not a whole-hearted recommendation but it's one of those independent films that digs deeper--or so it tries to--into the psychological aspect of our lives, places we don't and/or can't fathom due to the preference of face-value. Thus, watching this leaves us frozen right along with Henderson and Seth.",1448496000,,750,4.821705426356589
8332468,3,B001P80ZIS,A bit too bazaar for my taste.,1447027200,,30,3.4285714285714284
8332469,3,B001P80ZIS,I had a problem w/my first disc; it did not play on my player. You sent me a second one and it won't play on my player but would play on a friend's player. The movie was very good but I'll never be able to watch it again unless I go visit my friend. I was told when you mailed the second one to me that there would be a return mailing label but there wasn't so now I have two unplayable DVDs. I can't afford an all-region player at this time.,1444262400,,442,3.8152173913043477
8332470,4,B001P80ZIS,"Interesting and engaging art house flick with a supernatural turn that surprises. Great role for Shirley Henderson as the main star, and a creepy part for RA.",1433030400,,158,4.888888888888889
8332471,5,B001P80ZIS,Exactly as shown. Quick delivery.,1425686400,,33,5.8
8332472,1,B001P80ZIS,"Terrible, don't waste your money",1423353600,,32,5.6
8332473,2,B001P80ZIS,"i could not understand the english speech , i do not care for the actress, i only rented it because Richard Armitage was in it and i saw very  little of him , sorry",1414281600,,164,3.823529411764706
8332474,2,B001P80ZIS,Frozen was a slow moving movie with a bummer ending.,1409788800,,52,4.3
