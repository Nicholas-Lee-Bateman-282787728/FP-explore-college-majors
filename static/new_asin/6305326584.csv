7887638,3,6305326584,"A beautiful-looking but disturbing film about a dark fetish.
A young woman is looking for a room to rent and finds one for a low price.  After moving in, her landlord, who looks like Deneuve in The Hunger, tells her that she likes to drink blood on occasion and it is simpler if she drinks that of her tenant.  It is not required and she will not be forced, but it is simpler.
The tenant is immediately turned off by the idea, but is has been planted in her psyche.  While exploring the house she finds a small shrine and the razor blade used for letting blood.  The idea is no longer as bad as before.
Eventually she gives her OK and is cut and drunk from.  She feels a closeness she has not felt before.  She enjoys the feeling that she is needed.  Unfortunately she gets hooked.  Now she begins to pressure her landlord into drinking more.
The psycho drama continues until the tenant becomes a drinker as well as the two feast off of the landlords semi-boyfriend.  Now both woman are looking for a donor and we get a cameo by Julie Strain.
Dark and beautiful, but many will find the subject disturbing in is portrayal and believability.",1054598400,3,1139,4.385714285714286

These two women were not real vampires the were two women that had a blood fetish. Celia is  looking for a place to live but she got a little something extra! Premise of story Celia moves in, Whitney lets her know that in order to live there she has to let her suck on her. Celia mulls this decision over and decides, Well?What the Hell! Celia gets addicted and obcessed with Whitney after the blood drinking and a sexual encounter with her. Celia gets jealous of the boyfriend because she feels he is coming between her and Whitney. Celia goes on a rampage to reclaim Whitney from him. Basically that is the Premise of the story...by the way Celia (Played by Leslie Danon)is an extremley sexy/gorgious female a plus for the film! The music in the film is excellent,there is a song by Acid Reign called ""Restore"" That is very reminisent to some of Tricky's earlier work. Also the lesbian scene is very nicely filmed...Well worth the purchase! The acting would put you in the mind of a David Lynch movie..there is alot of nonchalantness going on. I am not a blood drinker but something turned me on about this movie!",1040256000,5,1286,4.4491525423728815
7887640,1,6305326584,"Movie about mentally messed up women, not horror. Unpleasant ending, all women end up looking bad. Painful to watch at times. Waste of money.",987465600,,141,4.916666666666667
