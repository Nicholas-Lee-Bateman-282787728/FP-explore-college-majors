7499748,5,B017DYVF40,"Caveat: I am a huge Bruce Campbell fan and the Evil Dead trilogy are my favorite movies.  That being said, this long overdue continuation of Ash's story does not disappoint!.  The show uses the trademark Evil Dead 2/Army of Darkness horror comedy style of campy one-liners, slapstick comedy, over the top gore, and deadite decimation.  If you are a fan of the horror comedy genre you will love this show!",1449532800,49,404,4.742857142857143
7499749,5,B017DYVF40,"Ash is definitely back.  I loved the 1st episode and it's nod to the original trilogy.  The screens are scarier, the fights are better, the special effects are awesome and the wise cracks keep coming.  This is a must watch for all Evil Dead fans.  Hail to the King, baby!",1449532800,90,271,4.36

7499752,5,B017DYVF40,"Shame they've ended it. Ash vs. Evil Dead is a horror comedy that knows it's audience and delivers what such a show should, in generous amounts. Not everyone's cup of tea, but why should it be?",1530748800,,193,4.388888888888889

7499754,5,B017DYVF40,"Fans of the Evil Dead franchise will not be disappointed to watch this series.  Bruce Campbell reprises his role as Ash Williams, Deadite Slayer Extraordinaire... a virtuoso with the chainsaw and double-barrel shotgun when it comes to dispatching the undead.  Though he obviously has a few more miles on the odometer, Campbell still has the magic and does not disappoint.  This series is a real roller-coaster ride of humor, savage darkness and gore - and covers a lot of ground.  The first season is especially strong, the second and third still very entertaining and needed for closure.  This is allegedly Campbell's last stint as ""Ash"" so get it while it's hot.  Great send-off for a franchise that still delivers after all these decades.",1529712000,,741,4.983739837398374

7499761,5,B017DYVF40,Recreates the tone of Evil Dead 2 well and introduces a lot of interesting new characters. Gets more horrific as the season wears on but is always ghoulishly funny as well.

7499772,4,B017DYVF40,"1st of all - it isn't 3 seasons - it is one season, chopped into 3, so they can milk your wallet if you're stupid enough, yes stupid enough, to buy it. It's over the top gore fest - good ONLY because Campbell is back - and bad because it tries too hard with shiitty writers and even more pathetic dialog - Campbell has a difficult time saving this, and honestly, if you're 13 and have a gore fetish? - it's probably for you. 4 stars because of the BoomStick wielding awesomeness of Campbell - and that's it.",1524787200,,507,4.183673469387755

7499791,5,B017DYVF40,"Just recently added Stars to my plan at home and before I'd seen any of these episodes of Ash vs. The Evil Dead I'd been a huge Bruce Campbell fan, everything from the original Evil Dead films to the short run television series Brisco County Jr. I'd seen commercials for this show years ago and didn't really think much of it, I thought it was just a way someone was trying to milk $ out of the franchise and that's as far as it went for my interest, but having added Stars recently I was able to watch the first episode of the 3rd season, nothing else was on and I've gotta say, it held up pretty well, funny, gorey, well connected to the movie and done rite like it was made by the fans, then the end credits told me what bigger fans already knew, that the shows are all put together by the exact same people that did the movies, too cool! So I've been watching every episode with about the same interest I had in the first 6 seasons of the walking dead, which made me wanna see the other seasons, so I got season one of Ash vs. The Evil Dead on Blu-ray for like $18 if I remember correctly and it was well worth it, in season one after the first episode, you know it's something you're really gonna love if you've seen the original Evil Dead films, I just wish they'd talk more about the events in Army of Darkness, it's like they're under contract or something to not use film footage or make any mention of Ash traveling back in time and fighting the deadites in a time reminiscent of King Arthur, but that's all speculation, I have no idea why they don't use anything from Army of Darkness in the show, but it would've been GROOVEY!!!!",1521849600,,1641,4.229299363057325

7499794,5,B017DYVF40,"Being an Evil Dead fan, I knew I had to tune into this bad boy. the show is just pure fun, plain and simple, its filled with bloody action and mayhem, brutal amounts of gore, ridiculousness, cheesy one liners, and belly laughs, even suspense too for good measure and everybody looks like they're having a blast Including ash's sidekicks who are just as tough as he is. best of all, the show is completely self aware, it has the attitude of ""we know this is super violent, over the top, and gory as all get out, but hey, just enjoy it lol"".

If you love the Evil Dead Series and the reboot series, You'll flippin' love this DVD which plays as expected on my 4 or 5 year old Panasonic SA-BT200 Blu-ray Home Theater 5.1 Surround Sound System.

The only movie menu sound system ""choice"" when you launch the DVD, is 7.1 Surround.
I only have 5.1 Surround...
So, I selected that (7.1) from the menu. I

Thankfully, it started right up and sounds amazing!  I was very impressed with the sound quality (fantastic!), along with the seriously OUTSTANDING picture quality which also looks incredible on this 65in HD LCD Television,Again, it's a Model NS-65D2601A13,  INSIGNIA brand tv from Best Buy.  I'm running everything HDMI connections (The tv offers other types of connections but HDMI works great) through a 4 way HDMI switch box with a remote.
Insignia is, I believe, Best Buy Corps. brand of Television.

This is all of course for anyone who cares or owns an INSIGNIA television.  They work great and look beautiful!
I'm only adding the INSIGNIA part because I see a lot of bad reviews for INSIGNIA televisions here and there.
I guess they either work great or they don't work for long...
Mine has been working PERFECTLY, going on 5 years now (knock on wood!).
Not to mention, THIS television was the last STORE display model which only God knows, how long it had been running - Before I got it home.
In my opinion, it has been an exceptionally good television with a great picture!  I'm very happy with it!

 The only cons on all these major brand televisions are a lack of HDMI plugs on the back you shouldn't have to go buy a damn HDMI splitter or anything like that! every damn television should have at least five HDMI plugs on the back they are dirt cheap yet, manufacturers just don't put them on the televisions?!

7499858,1,B017DYVF40,"Great show, but be warned that with any Anchor Bay/Starz physical release you MUCH watch the show within the vendors return window.  According to a lengthy conversation - most of which I was on hold - with Anchor Bay/Starz customer support, unlike EVERY other studio producing physical media, Anchor Bay/Stars takes absolutely no accountability whatsoever to the shoddy manufacturing practices they use for physical media.  If your disc is defective from the factory, they will not under any circumstances replace anything bought through a ""third party"" vendor, which is what they consider amazon.  We like to wait to watch shows like this around Halloween.  BIG mistake, as the second disc was scratched from the factory.  Be warned, with any Anchor Bay/Starz home video release, be it Blu-ray or DVD, you need to verify it works properly within amazon's return window, as the manufacturer Starz/Anchor Bay Home Entertainment does not warrant their products against manufacturing defects that they are directly responsible for.",1499212800,5,1028,5.3602484472049685

It's not all tongue-in-cheek, and not all trying to be too serious. If you're unfamiliar with the films, might be best to see them first for the backstory. Film creator Sam Raimi is pretty involved in this tv version so I think that's why the quality is high.",1488499200,,418,4.662162162162162

She was a History major in college and with shock and fear worried for me, she answered,  ""yes... The Necronomicon"" After she went into detail Bruce Campbell became my hero. Second grade!

Tonally, it's runs the gamut from the legitimate scariness of Evil Dead to the pure camp of Army of Darkness (although frankly I think it's SLIGHTLY less campy overall than Army of Darkness). Ash is as quotable as ever and somehow doesn't become tiresome over the course of the season. Tons and tons of practical effects and more blood than you are expecting. I don't care how much you are expecting... there is more than that.

And this time he's managed to save himself two young apprentices on his quest to rid the world of both evil AND the Necrimonicon! He might be a bit off his game, reading aloud from the book drunk and stoned and trying to impress a girl, but to hear Ash tell it, it's been a drunk, stoned thirty YEARS of living in the (super awesome) airstream and working the local SMart...thirty years of sitting on that book and never once using it to score. He must have just forgotten about the everyone becoming dead due to EVIL if he reads from it, that's all. Bruce Campbell should be in every movie existing.

7500014,4,B017DYVF40,"I enjoyed this series a lot. It's not perfect - without spoiling too much I think they should have done more with a couple of characters, and I'm not over keen on their devolution of Ash into the somewhat peurile character he has become (something you didn't really see in the films. He could be pretty stupid in Army of Darkness, sure, but some of the humour in Ash Vs. Evil Dead is a bit tacky.) but overall I felt it captured the tone of the second film pretty well.

A good, fun ride overall. Definitely not for the kiddies, but that should go without saying.

The extras were not bad either. I was disappointed we did not see any deleted scenes, but each episode is accompanied by a commentary option, which is very nice.

By the way, this is plays fine in the UK (where I am) so I guess it is region free. It's difficult to find the Blu ray in the UK, for some reason, and the version you can get on Amazon.co.uk is an expensive import. You're best just going to Amazon.com (the US version of Amazon) and importing from there. It will likely work out cheaper.

Dana DeLorenzo is a ball busting, ass kicking master of waif-fu. Ray Santiago is hilarious, charming and impeccably upbeat. I really enjoy watching this show.

Sometimes. Does he have a plan to save the world ? Nope! What he does is follow his gut and do what's got to be done to get rid of the demons and save his friends!",1482019200,,472,3.9789473684210526

7500144,5,B017DYVF40,"Great, fun show. LOTS of blood splatter and ""old school"" effects - not old fashioned, not ""fake"" or cheap looking. Just not digital, and using physical items where others would probably use digital. Not to say digital isn't used - the demon in season 1, played by an actor, is enhanced with digital effects in a very effective and memorable way.
Full of humor and so far over the top violence and gore its beyond ""shock value"". A work of love by people who loved the original Evil Dead movies, but now with a huge budget.
This show goes beyond nearly any limits you can think of. Buckets of blood and gore - check. Extensive drug use - check. Demonically possessed colon and all that that implies - check.
Yes, some of the episodes can drag, with set up taking a little too long, the gore scenes taking up a little too much time instead of advancing the plot or dialog between the wonderfully cast actors. The second season has a few more of these than the first, but they can't all be gems.",1481241600,,991,4.391304347826087

Every episode I watch leaves me wanting more!",1481068800,,297,4.321428571428571
7500165,5,B017DYVF40,Great,1480982400,,5,5.0
7500166,5,B017DYVF40,"Right off the bat, let me just say that I have been an Evil Dead fan since the first film and beyond. Obviously I was excited when news of a show broke out, because as any Evil Dead fan will tell you, we just wanted more. A show is the PERFECT way to give us more as we get multiple episodes, equaling multiple seasons, equaling multiple hours of content to watch and enjoy.

Ash vs Evil Dead is the perfect blend of the films. I've always felt like Evil Dead was horror, Evil Dead 2 was comedy horror, and Army of Darkness was comedy. Ash vs Evil Dead keeps the humor from Army of Darkness, but brings back the scary from the previous films. What's great is they not only introduce Ash at a completely different time in his life years after the films, but they bring in new characters that don't feel out of place. It all fits together nicely like a big Evil Dead puzzle.

That's not to say, however, that this isn't just a love letter to fans. They are able to pay tribute to everything you love about Evil Dead and even bring new things to the table. This show has it all. The soundtrack itself is amazing, the chainsaw is back in action, the cabin returns, time travel, the classic, the shotgun, the deadites, the book, and oh dear god, the blood. Starz was definitely the perfect choice for this show as they not only let them do what they want, but also tell them to go even further.

As if that all wasn't enough, the writing in the show is fantastic. Bruce Campbell has definitely come a long way since the first Evil Dead, and it shows. The stories they tell are not only hilarious, but can also be intense. It's not just the decapitations you care about, but you actually give a s*** about the characters, you actually want to see what happens next, and you even get stuff you didn't even know you wanted. Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi, the showrunners, the network, the writers... you can tell they care about this show. You can tell they care about the fans. They're not just making a show to get people to shut up about another Evil Dead. Love definitely goes into the making of Ash vs Evil Dead, and it shows.

I'm trying my best to write this review without any spoilers, which I'm finding difficult, so I will just end it here. If you're reading this, please know that this show is amazing and it's for both fans and newcomers alike. There are so many ways to see shows like this nowadays, but I actually bought and pay for a Starz subscription SPECIFICALLY so I can watch and support this show. Before there was a Sam and Dean, there was Ash, and Ash is back in business. HAIL TO THE KING, BABY!!",1480982400,23,2609,4.318367346938776

This series is not for casual audiences as much as it is for people jonesing for the good ol' days of Boomstick and Chainsaw-arm.

I am delighted to tell you that my face has fully melted, and I had a blast watching the first season. I haven't gotten to laugh this hard in a very long time. Bruce Campell is still hysterical, and the supporting cast are pretty good too. I won't even lie, there are definitely some times that it was pretty frightening.

7500362,5,B017DYVF40,"Since Army of Darkness, there have been countless tie-ins or vs story comic books, and even some pretty forgettable video games where none have captured what was great about the Evil Dead franchise. No matter what, it was never the same unless Bruce Campbell was actually portraying his most notable acting role. Its been literally 23 years since we last saw Ashley J. Ash Williams eviscerate a deadite with a chainsaw hand or deliver a snarky one liner before boomsticking something in the face.  So, if you have been patiently waiting since 1992 for the next official installment, Ash vs Evil Dead is your blood soaked ticket.

The best part about this Sam Raimi produced TV series is that its made like nothing has changed since 1992. Everything you loved about watching the movie trilogy is all here and then some. Its hilarious, extremely gory, and action packed. The way scenes play out with a very familiar score is a direct homage to the movies that spawned it. Each episode hits the right amount of cheesiness at the best times. Every episode has been fun to watch and laugh through. So far, none have literally been labeled as boring or a drag to get through. Joining the main cast is Ray Santiago as Pablo and Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly. At first, I was worried that this show was going to become another passing the torch for a newer generation type of story. Instead I ended up enjoying these two a lot with how they deal with Ashs events. Another is Lucy Lawless as the mysterious Ruby. Im not going to lie, Ive enjoyed watching Lucy Lawless since I was a kid during the other Sam Raimi TV days of Xena: Warrior Princess. Campbell was even a guest star on that series, so its fitting that she is present in AvED. Unless the special features reveal it different, apparently all of the cast have had fun making this series, even if every episode requires them to be covered with fake blood and guts.

One smartest decisions Starz made for this TV series is the 30 minute runtime of each episode. I know thats strange to mention, but I really appreciated viewing AvED this way so the comedy and horror never wear out its welcome. However, I do suggest to take breaks between episodes so 1. Its not over already and 2. I felt that I needed a slight calm down for the gore.  Mentioning violence again, a warn of caution: AvED takes full advantage of its premium channel freedoms. Expect the unexpected with this shows extreme violence and vulgarity. While Game of Thrones and the Walking Dead have their goriest moments, (and I hate to be that guy) they have nothing on some scenes from AvED. And season 2s second episode just proved my point. I hope you deadites enjoy the bloody and gorey return of Ash as much as I did. Three episodes of season 2, AvED is not letting up anytime soon.

7500394,5,B017DYVF40,"October begins and its the month of Halloween, so what better time than now to highlight a horror series that recently made its way to disc. Fans of EVIL DEAD 1 & 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS have thrilled to the horrific and yet humorous adventures of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) since the first film arrived way back in 1981. Praised by Stephen King, loved by fans and a nominee on nearly every list of favorite horror films, the original played for scares while the two sequels more for laughs. They launched the career of Sam Raimi to the point he directed 3 Spider-man films. And now Ash has made his way to series and a disc set.

A basis overview of the original: Ash and friends discover an ancient book bound in flesh that when read aloud unleashed a demonic evil that kills his friends. Ash ends up having to cut off his own hand and take on the demon alone, even going back in time to do so. A quick summation but all you need.

In the Starz series ASH VS EVIL DEAD the story picks up years later. Ash remains one handed, still works a low level job in retail and retains possession of the Necronomicon or Book of the Dead. Hes still the same goofy character we came to love years ago, smart mouthed, subtle as a shovel to the head and more inclined to look for a party than trouble. Unfortunately one drunken hookup has Ash bragging and showing off the book to his conquest of the night and then reading from it. Of course this show off stunt unleashes the Deadites (Evil dead bad guys/demons) again.

Various Deadite occurrences follow. One involves police detective Amanda Fisher (Jill Marie Jones) and her partner investigating a dark house. Her partner is killed and then possessed by a Deadite forcing her to shoot him to defend herself. Put on leave she begins to look into any and all clues on her own time to find out just whats going on, eventually leading her to Ash.

But Ash has his own problems when Deadites attack the store where he works. With the help of co-worker Pablo (Ray Santiago) who worships Ash and Kelly (Dana DeLorenzo) they escape to his trailer where he hopes to find a way of destroying the book. At that trailer they are attacked and the two youngsters get to see Ash in action as he grabs his boomstick aka shotgun to take out one Deadite and straps on his chainsaw to the stump where his hand once was to take down another. Yes, that may sound crazy but it works.

And like that the threesome is destined to take the path of trying to save the world. With a few stops along the way like checking on Kellys family and a visit to Pablos shaman uncle. Each 30 minute episode takes us down the road they're traveling and offers us more clues as to what is going on and how to stop it. The end result is that Ash must face the responsibility hes been trying to avoid all these years and become the hero he was meant to be, albite a tarnished one at best.

The show takes the best parts of the original trilogy and multiplies them to a point where they work marvelously well. The character of Ash is a hoot, with a ton of humor on the surface and a hero buried underneath it all that just needs brought out. Pablo is a fantastic sidekick, wanting to join the good fight for the wrong reason (to get closer to Kelly) but willing to follow Ash anywhere. And Kelly offers that tough girl exterior who has a soft spot as well, who thinks of Pablo as a brother but who may change eventually. While Ash doesnt want their help initially he eventually knows hell need it.

Every actor in this series is well suited for their parts. Let me say up front as a fan of Campbell he once again brings Ash to life, and I mean that in a good way. He offers the broad strokes when needed and the subtle ones when called for. Ash is the reluctant hero, a man whose crass ways lead him to make mistakes but someone youd want in your corner once he gets there. Santiago and DeLorenzo are fresh faces to me and handle their roles well enough to keep up with Campbell, growing into them with each episode.

The first season now on disc only lasts 10 episodes which is a shame. When it was over I found myself wanting more. Season 2 has just started on Starz but I can wait for the season to make its way to disc. That means I can take the time to savor each episode. I can also enjoy the fact that theyve announced Lee Majors to portray Ash father! In the meantime I think Ill find myself watching this one more than once, just like I did the original movies. Maybe a weekend of EVIL DEAD with all three films and this series is in order. That might make a fun filled Halloween weekend. This is one not to rent but to add to your shelf. The combination of horror, extreme gore and laughs make it just that good.",1477008000,,4723,4.26927374301676

What you really get is a great roller coaster ride which has you laughing at the things that should make us cringe but instead you want more.

7500430,5,B017DYVF40,"As a native of the Detroit area I have always felt a bit of a personal connection to Evil Dead which was made by two fellow Detroit area natives, Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell. Even before the ultra-low budget classic was released in 1981, local papers were running stories about the ambitious project produced by a bunch of college students. Now, nearly 25 years after Army of Darkness the third film in the Evil Dead trilogy, the Starz network revives reluctant hero Ash Williams (Campbell) and a host of demons in an original TV series, Ash vs. Evil Dead.ash-1

The 10 episode series is set in modern day Michigan where Ash has amounted to little after his many horrifying encounters with the Deadites. Hes scratching out an existence as a sales clerk in a discount retail store and living in a trailer park where he drinks too much and spins tales to impress barflies into fleeting sexual encounters. It is during one of these drunken encounters that Ash reads poetry from the Necronomicon and mistakenly unleashes demons into the world. After fighting off a couple of the Deadites with his trusty shotgun and chainsaw hand, Ash flees the trailer park with two of his co-workers, Pablo (Santiago) and Kelly (DeLorenzo). Meanwhile, Michigan State Police Detective Amanda Fisher has had her own encounter with the demons, losing her partner in the process. She goes after Ash, believing that he is the one responsible, accompanied by a mysterious woman named Ruby (Lawless) who knows a great deal about the demons.

Over the course of the next nine episodes, Ash vs. Evil Dead is essentially a buddy/road adventure movie with the three friends encountering and battling demons and trying to find a way to reverse the incantation that freed them. Along their travels they meet Pablos uncle, a shaman who attempts to help them defeat the demons and a gung-ho band of militiamen who find themselves over their heads in a battle against one of their demon-possessed members. The first season culminates in a return to where it all started, that rundown old cabin in the woods where Ash has to face off against his Deadite doppelganger and is forced into a fateful decision by Ruby.

Ash vs Evil Dead Season 2 2016

Ash vs. Evil Dead masterfully combines the slapstick humor of Army of Darkness with the terrifying hopelessness of Evil Dead. And it all comes with dozens of beheadings, dismemberments, and enough blood and guts to fill dozens of buckets. Bruce Campbells forte has always been his wise-cracking brand of humor in the face of insurmountable odds and it is the driving force to the series. Ash may be 30 years older but hes lost none of the smarmy, smart ass edge that has endeared him to horror fans for decades. Even when his own self-indulgent desires threatens to doom his friends he is able to rally and save the day.

Pablo and Kelly make the perfect sidekicks, keeping Ash (somewhat) grounded and making sure he doesnt run off on his own to play hero. Lucy Lawless as Ruby gives the series something the films lacked, a face of the antagonist. There is still much about her we don't know. And a highlight of the series was a return to the old cabin. Yes it wasn't the original, which was an actual remote cabin in the woods. But it is a perfect mockup complete with the lazy moving swing on the porch and the ominous trap door that leads to the cellar.ash-4

Now is the perfect time to jump into the seriesget the first season on blu-ray and get ready for season two beginning October 2!

You can really get the essence of the styleguide that was set forth.
Bruce Campbell really shows his natural account of the Ash Williams character.
I was a little hesitant that it would have a 'campy' horror vibe as with most remakes
but it proved me wrong on all points.
I love that it really touches on the concept that everyone Ash loves dies with no sense
of remorse or holding punches.
The new characters involved are brilliant and they really do show growth as well as push the plot forward.
This show really kept the vision and did not steer away from doing anything that they seen fit.
Starz is really amazing for the fact that they didn't sheer away any creative control due to the content.

7500541,3,B017DYVF40,"Have loved EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS for years.  Saw both in the theaters on their first runs.  Was really excited to see the new series... but was left wanting something a bit funnier.  The story was okay... Ash irresponsibly unleashes the demons again (30 years later) ... and mayhem ensues.  Along the way we visit a department store, a bookstore, a farm, a curandero's compound, and a survivalist compound. The digital effects were serviceable, the movie was gory as expected, and there was a lot of humor.  The only problem is... that it was just not that funny.  Not as funny as it should have been.  Ash had some good lines, but they weren't as good as his lines in AOD.  It was great to see Bruce Campbell back... and he's the best thing about this show.  His two cohorts weren't as interesting.  Lucy Lawless ... I thought she was a strange addition.  A cameo by Mimi Rogers.  A return to the cabin was amazing.... and seeing it was a blast.  The end had the potential to really elevate the series... and they totally didn't go there.  You will know what I mean when you see it.  One unexpected positive is that Sam Raimi directed the first episode.  You could really tell the difference.  The last episode started off so well... I thought he was back.  But no... somebody else directed it.  But he was good... it fit the style that this show needed more of.  I wanted to really love this ... I paid full price for it digitally on Prime... and maybe I'll warm up to it on subsequent viewings.  I'm hoping that ... with one season down... the next season will show some improvement.  More humor.  Better dialogue.  Better one liners for Ash.  And maybe a few less F bombs.  The F bombs made SCARFACE seem tame.  Highly recommended for diehard fans of EVIL DEAD 2.  And if you haven't seen ED2 or AOD... by all means watch those first.",1474848000,2,1849,4.4226190476190474

The writing is decent and the character development is great. If you don't fall in love or admire the characters for who they are by the middle of the season, there's no help for you!  Raimi only directs the first one and you can clearly tell that his style is plastered ALL over it. Us fans love it!  However,  The other directors and writers didn't awesome job in emulating Sam Raimi's work and bring their own spirit and light to it.  It's a shame that they were unable to get the rights to Army of Darkness, as most of us fans love quoting Bruce Campbell from that movie. All of his quotes from that movie are nonexistent other than often quoted ""groovy"",  but that exists in the world of ED.  There is not even a hint to him battling Deadites in the past other than simply a picture in the Necronomicon of the chosen one.  The supporting cast is awesome and they do a great job in keeping Ash in check. I can't wait for the second season and hope it's as awesome as the first!",1474588800,,1116,4.211267605633803

7500586,5,B017DYVF40,"If you are a fan of evil dead, evil dead 2, or army of darkness then this TV show is a must buy! The TV show basically picks up 25 to 30 years after the movies. Ash is now in his golden years and unwittingly opens a gate to hell after reading a passage from the book of the dead. After realizing what he has done he sets out on a journey to undo what he has done, battling deadites along the way in typical evil dead fashion chainsaw arm and boomstick! This TV show stays true to the movies and never takes itself to seriously, and I was surprised to find that xeena warrior princess (Lucy Lawless) herself is one of the cast members! This blu ray is definitely worth the 25$ I easily would have paid 40$ for it.",1473638400,,712,4.056737588652482

Ash comes out of retirement when be (once again) accidentally activates the forces of evil and must fight it with a a pair of co-workers Pablo and Kelly ( Ray Santiago and Dana DeLorenzo who also appeared in an Allstate commercial before this show). Lucy Lawless also shows up playing Ruby Knoby the daughter of the professor from the first film. Each episode is 30 minutes long and it is a packed 30 minutes.

""Ash"" was originally scripted to be the 4th film in the series but they had too much material for a film.

The Blu-Ray release of ""Ash vs. Evil Dead"" looks extremely good in high def and each episode receives a commentary track. Audio sounds excellent with dialog front and center with a very active 5.1 mix. All ten episodes look amd sound excellent!

There's also a trio of nice featurette said but the commentary tracks are the meat and potatoes of special features doe this set.

If you are a fan of the Evil Dead films (especially Army of Darkness) and like the mix of wacky humor and horror that Sam Rami brought to his films about Ash and his adventures, you'll enjoy the show.

Way better than that P.O.S. re-make they put out back in 2013.  It just goes to show you, no Ash... no Evil Dead...plain and simple.  The series follows our hero along with two of his fellow co-workers at the store they work in.  After a night smoking the refer with a hottie, Ash remembers reading from the Book of the Dead to impress her.  Well, that unleashed hell.  All three gang up to try to defeat the Evil Dead and all kinds of funny and graphic violence ensue.  All episodes are under 30 minutes except the first episode which was directed by Sam Raimi.  Very groovy show and will not disappoint any Evil Dead fan.  Awesome acting, effects and a killer soundtrack as well.  This series contains audio commentaries on all episodes and three additional supplements on disc two.

Ash Inside the World (1080p, 15:59): A fun piece that runs through the basics of each episode. The piece examines story, visual effects, gore, Sam Raimi's direction in episode one, making various scenes, anecdotes from the shoot, filmmaking methods, characters and performances, and more.

Who can stop laughing at ashes bad pick up lines and his horrible decisions. Just a reminder we are not that stupid. The story picks up with ash back to working in the value Mart.

7500690,5,B017DYVF40,"The series is great. Somehow Raimi and Bruce Campbell have capured the flavor of the original movie 30 years ago. I am in my 50s, so I remember Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn very well. The special effects are superb; I would say even better then the original movie. For a TV series all involved have done an excellent job. I wouldn't let young children watch it, but it's a treat for adults to see Bruce Campbell reprise his original character. Very quickly you forget that he is 30 + years older. He smashes plates over his head with the same gusto as he did so many years ago.
The story line is also very good. Before I started watching I was skeptical at what could be done to expand the story line, but my fears were laid to rest after viewing the first 3 episodes. If you are a Bruce Campbell fan, or even a Lucy Lawless fan, then season 1 is a must see. I cannot wait until season 2 starts in October of 2016.

7500727,4,B017DYVF40,"This show is fantastic. The material really benefits from the ""anything goes"" nature of premium cable; in a show all about over-the-top violence and larger-than-life characters, giving the cast and crew the freedom to go nuts with the gore and the swearing and situations is ideal.

Even the plot is entertaining, rather than just being a vehicle for the violence. We get more of Ash's character in ten episodes than we ever did in three films, and you start to see him as a real person by the end of things. A very stupid person who only really excels when he's killing Deadites, but we get glimpses of his life and his hopes and fears that make him more real.

The last episode is awfully anti-climactic, and it's the only reason I'm not giving the show five stars. It's completely in Ash's character for things to shake out the way that they do, but it makes the season feel like an incomplete story. I guess we'll have to stick around for Season 2.

Overall, this is an excellent series. It's funny, it's violent, it's supremely entertaining. It doesn't function as a stand alone effort, though, so make sure you've seen the movies before you begin and make sure you watch Season 2 when it comes out.",1469491200,,1204,4.564814814814815

Bruce Campbell is entertaining, and his young sidekicks are not unappealing - but the whole venture just seems really aimless and not particularly well thought-out.  It may be that the 'Evil Dead' universe is not conducive to long-form storytelling: each of the movies is designed around giving you a visceral kick and not much more.  The series tries to replicate that kick on a weekly basis, but frankly within the comparatively micro-budget and shooting schedule time frame of television, the best it can offer is a watered-down version. (Not to mention, not having Sam Raimi behind the camera on a weekly basis.)  It could have compensated for this lack by a more detailed and thought-out examination of the backstory and mythology behind the Deadites and the Necronomicon, and maybe it will go this route in future seasons.

7500784,5,B017DYVF40,Great for fans of the Evil Dead movies series and new viewers too!  Wish it had a little more of the high energy humor of the original and the gore looks a little too realistic (it was a little more fun when the gore was a little more animated and fake looking).  I love the references to the originals and the look and feel of the show is wonderful!  Having Lucy Lawless there is a real treat as are the new characters.,1467072000,,420,4.097560975609756

It has all the humor of Army Of Darkness, the hardcore violence of Evil Dead and production values that rival the stunning visuals of the Evil Dead remake. But most importantly it's fun. This isn't just a nostalgia trip. You're not tuning in just to see Ash say ""Groovy"" every week. You're invested in the characters, and sometimes legitimately scared and shocked. I can't wait for more.",1465084800,,480,4.593023255813954

7500852,4,B017DYVF40,"I am personally kinda surprised the rating is SO high for this series, although TV shows are generally rated higher for some reason. The show is pretty good, obviously Bruce Campbell is much older now (and they use that as the butt of a lot of jokes) so that changes things a bit, but what is even more of a change is seeing Ash with this ""team"" that came together (unofficially the ""Ghostbeaters"" I guess?). For 3 movies Ash has been the lone Deadite slayer and thats how we've all loved it, when you add in these two new (and significantly younger) characters it really changes that dynamic.

One of the things that such defines the original 3 films is the practical make up and FX, and while I will certainly prop the decision to use more of that in this series than would probably be expected, there are just a bit too many CG scenes in it for my taste that feels like it cheapens to overall character of the show. For example, in one of the scenes there is a CG skeleton, instead of making it CG, they should have just done it in the GoMotion style as was done in Army of Darkness (even though unfortunately AoD is an unacknowledged part of the Evil Dead canon in this show due to a rights dispute).

All in all for people that have just been thirsting for some new Evil Dead material (thats not a remake) this should pretty much get the job done. It follows a definitely lighter path than the first and second film but certainly has it's moments and episodes that makes it feel closer to the source. Here's to hoping the second season is even better!",1464652800,4,1556,4.3436426116838485

But they are very good and stays true to the franchise. A minority of people didn't like the series but a large huge amount of real fans and people who know the difference between nostalgia and a good product can see the difference and appreciate a good series when they see it.

There is really only one episode about halfway through the season where things get kind of bogged down and boring, otherwise this series delivers on the goods as far as the tropes from the films are concerned.
At the end of the first episode when Ash is asked, ""How does it feel to be back Heffeh?"", Ashes response ""Groovy""

We're talking full beast mode anti gravity flight to hook up scenes with his special chain saw to cut off the heads of the deadites. I have always loved the movies, so you can imagine how thrilled I was that Starz produced a TV series Ash vs Evil Dead. In the series it pretty much starts 30 years after Ash was running under the radar of evil. But Ash let his guard down one night while entertaining a lady friend and they opened the Book of the Dead and said a few lines and vuole the deadites come out of the woodwork again. Although Ash likes to work alone he ends up enlisting a couple of young neighbors to fight the deadites. Excellent series for any fan of the genre, but exceptional treat for us fans of the Evil Dead series. Once I saw Sam Raimi was behind this as well I was certain this was going to be great, and it is.

If you're a fan of Army of Darkness like I am, well, that's a very high bar, and I don't think they quite made it.  I didn't like the sidekicks at first, but they grew on me as the series progressed.  The last three or so episodes were simply awesome and reaped handsome rewards.

But it's fitting and edgy - perfect for today's Evil Dead.

Credit Sam Raimi for going back to his patented mix of of unique camera movement and punch-you-in-the nose storytelling, and making it work all that much better so many years later.  Credit the amazing Bruce Campbell, who puts on the Ash character like your favorite, worn and weathered, ridiculous, out of fashion jacket that holds so many memories, and is the envy of all your friends.  Nothing like this exists anywhere else, with its cavalier and cartoonish violence, the Deadites an original mix of high-energy martial-arts based zombies with evil spirit and malevolent wit.

I was very nervous when I first heard this was coming back as a television show; I just didn't think it could hold the unique energy for multiple episodes, and at a time when 'reboot' is considered talent, there was a lot of potential for this to go south.  Much to my delight, the spark that made this story so fun, so original, and the dialog so darn sharp, is alive and well.

The plot isn't too complicated; they aren't trying to outsmart the audience by throwing in absurd twists that make zero sense. The humor is totally hilarious and on point and I laughed pretty hard at least a couple times each episode. Bruce has a total lack of regard for anyone he doesn't know and the fact that he'll do anything for momentary satisfaction is so incredibly funny. The gore is in your face and outrageous with each deadite bleeding enough for 20 people and they must have the highest blood pressure on the planet because when they get punctured it absolutely sprays for a good 15-20 ft at maximum gush for like 30 seconds. The sidekick characters aren't as annoying as I thought they might be with their main purpose being someone Bruce can belittle and vise versa.

The quality of the show, not our heroes.  Ash remains enjoyable throughout, as do Pablo and Kelly.  However, toward the end, it is revealed that it is not sadness which is demobilizing Fisher's character, but a lack of writing and acting ability.  (She does... come back, a bit.)  It seems to me that the writing team in general just plain ran out of ideas toward the end.  They wanted a big finish (of course) but the way they went was very unsatisfying to me, and I think a disservice to the characters.  I actually fast-forwarded through most of the last episode.

So, my advice:  Watch the first six episodes and enjoy some more time inhabiting Ash's universe.  Pretend 7 through 10 were never made.",1454371200,2,864,4.545454545454546

7500987,5,B017DYVF40,"The show is so fantastically well done, it was everything I could have ever wanted as a fan. They keep more to the style of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. Even though there's some cgi, the action is there along with Ash being his goofy self. They don't have the rights to AoD, but they make rereferences to AoD where they basically give the finger to Universal by being similar, yet different so they don't get sued for copyrights. It is a clever well done show, and any negative reviews you see are just probably people that aren't happy it wasn't exactly the same as the movies. It is fantastic. I watched the show as it aired, and the end of every episode left me wanting more. I can't wait till season 2 finally airs!!!",1453939200,18,726,4.306569343065694
7500988,5,B017DYVF40,"I'm a long time fan of the Evil Dead franchise as well as Bruce Campbell. I grew up watching Army of Darkness, Brisco County Jr., and Jack of All Trades. I've read Bruce's autobiography, If Chins Could Kill, and enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles over the years. While I haven't made efforts to meet the man himself like other fans, the characters Mr. Campbell has played (particularly Brisco) have left an indelible impression on me.

Ash vs Evil Dead is a new take on the old magic. While the pace of the show is somewhat jerky, the acting is good, the lines are well delivered, and the show does evoke the nostalgia I expected. The show arguably has its weaknesses - the story jumps around and character development could be improved - but the effort is there and the lack of fine polish doesn't detract from what is clearly supposed to be a refresh of the B-movie classic. In fact, I would argue that if the show in its entirety were too well done (by modern standards) it would decrease the vision and ambiance of the show, not improve it. That said, I hope that Lucy Lawless' character has an opportunity for much more development as her story arc and role feel out of place as of Season 1.

Overall, I love the show - its tongue-in-cheek nature, knocking on (but not really breaking) the 4th wall, the chemistry of the actors, and of course, Mr. Campbell's trademark style.

The last thing I will say in this review is that I specifically elected to subscribe to the Starz video add-on through Amazon Prime to watch and support this show. I'll keep paying that premium for at least as long as Ash vs Evil Dead is running. I encourage fans that can afford to do so to do the same.",1453593600,3,1699,4.456591639871383

7501016,5,B017DYVF40,"I literally bought the Starz stand-alone subscription through Amazon (that's a thing now!) just for this show, and it has not disappointed.

If you liked Evil Dead 2 and loved Army of Darkness, then you'll love this. I think you could enjoy it without that history but it does help ring in some nostalgia as they clearly play off of several lines and scenes from the movies.

For the uninitiated:
I have struggled to explain the character of Ash to people. I most compare him to Jack Burton from Big Trouble in Little China or maybe something of a Han Solo meets Jack Sparrow? Sometimes he's very cowardly. And erratic. Often he's very smarmy. And super overconfident. But always he's good in a pinch. He's awesome at fighting evil and he has no idea how he does it. He mostly only fights when backed into a corner and then he's excellent at it.

So it's a pretty unique character, anyway. Basically he's the hapless college kid who found himself in horror movie conditions, everyone dying around him, had to chop off his own hand and decided at some point that he wasn't going to take it anymore and evil was going to get shotgunned in the face. He survived all that and many years of hiding (kinda cowardly!) later, Ash accidentally reveals his location to the evil that's been looking for him and now he's forced to fight again.

Or run away again.

Mostly both.

I dare say fans of AOD will not be disappointed here. Anyone else, hard to say. It's a quirky niche show. It's a bit of Monty Python meets horror. It's Big Trouble in Little China with maybe a little Tucker & Dale Versus Evil. Anyway, well worth a shot.

With that being said I'm disappointed in the series. I found myself skipping through a lot of the dry boring dialog which got in the way of the original story which was blood, gore and funny-one-liners. Ash vs Evil Dead is good but it fails to capture what the original movies produced. The series moves along like a jittery strung out junkie most likely to give Bruce Campbell more time on the screen. The story seems plastic with several of the characters poorly created and their development forced to keep up with the timeline of the main character (Ash). I was disappointed in Lucy Lawless's character as she has very little to do with the story. Ray and Dana's characters play the good sidekicks, but Dana's character was out of place early in the series. Jill Marie's character is one which was a square peg trying to fit in to a round hole. There is nothing wrong with her acting but her character could completely disappear from the script and you'd still have the same exact story. The blood and gore are perfect and the action scenes are the only reason to watch the series; every thing in between is terrible.

Great fun for die-hard fans and newcomers alike. Adding Lucy Lawless just contributes to an already
stellar reboot of the franchise. Top of the line tongue in cheek horror from one of the best creators
of the genre. Slapstick humor and sharp witted one-liners keep you laughing, while some of the suspenseful
moments rival the best in straight-up horror. Two thumbs up! (One thumb made of wood,of course)",1449619200,2,517,4.931034482758621
7501054,5,B017DYVF40,"It was bound to happen eventually. With all the crappy sequels and remakes that are out, it was only a matter of time for some movie or show to come along and do everything right, making an instant cult classic. This is it. This show proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is still room in this world for a tale of a man and his chainsaw. Hail to the king baby and load up the boom stick. This show has everything that made the movies amazing. It's campy, funny, awesome and even scary at times... all in the right places. Bruce Campbell was born to be Ash and the rest of the cast does what they should, support him. Let's face it, no matter how many side characters they bring in, this is Ash. It's all Ash and nothing but the Ash. But that's cool. They don't try to make deep compelling characters beyond an occasional few moments. The show knows its strengths and uses them to make one of the best things on TV. As long as they make Evil Dead, I'll watch it. Long may it reign.",1449532800,14,987,4.145833333333333

7501057,5,B017DYVF40,"Glad to see Amazon finally got this show on its website, even though you do have to pay a subscription for it after your free trial ends.

The show itself is definitely heading towards the right path. Instead of the gritty drama TV shows that we're used to like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Game Of Thrones"", this show has a much lighter mood to it. It's not that there isn't moments of danger and suspense, but the overall strength of this show is in its ability to play off itself and bring a playful tone to this genre of TV show.

The show does a great job of filling you in on the events that happened previously in the movie. It takes place 30 years after what happened in ""The Evil Dead"" and it's definitely good enough to be a stand-alone show all by itself. It delivers plenty of gore, jump scares, and funny moments and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite shows to watch. The Deadites (monsters in the show) look absolutely amazing. A few of them look silly at times, but most of the deadites look incredibly intimidating and nightmare inducing.

For a show like this, I'm glad to say that the story is actually very entertaining. I definitely recommend that you give this show a chance. It won't to appeal to everyone, but you won't know unless you watch it.",1449532800,13,1269,4.414529914529915

8738814,5,B017DYVF40,"What a great throwback show to take the essence of the original Evil Dead stuff and amp it up with new stories and characters!  Ash, a bit older, but still rockin, does an awesome job on this with his new 'gang'.  With a shotgun and chainsaw at the ready, we have lots of crazy-a** Evil Dead characters and lots of blood and guts to be had.  So it you haven't got my drift yet, this is very gory so don't expect this reboot to be some lite fare horror at all!  But then again if you are ready for some over the top gore and horror, stay tuned!  Being a big fan of the Evil Dead movies, I found myself going 'Holy S**t' a lot for a cable TV series for how graphic it is.  Either way, it is quite a ride that I'm sure you will enjoy.  Too bad it had to get canned after 3 seasons.",1532908800,,778,3.8860759493670884
8738815,5,B017DYVF40,"Such a good show so sad after 2 the evil dead disclosed spinal season period I really like that the only few things I didn't like with just that certain characters like Dalton shut up and on more episodes or should not have been written in at all. I did like the fact that they've written in a story line long lost daughter. I thought it fleshed out Ash as an actual person, though an intro in season 2 would have been better since shes introduced the end of ep 1. Making her hard accept in cast becaue of odd develop ment. though season 3 tops 2, 10fold.",1532044800,,555,4.148148148148148
