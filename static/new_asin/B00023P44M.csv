2059957,3,B00023P44M,"Usually before buying a product I check the reviews. Guess my enthusiasm, since i am a big Agatha Christie fan, this time played me because when I saw that this product was close captioned I bought it right away without checking the reviews. Its not close captioned, and that bothers me since I needed a product with those specifications  and it fooled me into thinking that it was. That's why I gave it 3 star. The rest is fine. I think David Suchet plays a wonderful role as Hercules Poirot.",1275350400,,493,4.477777777777778

Love the cars, cloths,location and sets.  Hastings gets what he asked for in Murder in the Mews.  All of the cases are good on this set and my wife and I have collected all but one case, I'm not sure it's on DVD.",1192579200,3,280,4.072727272727272
2059963,3,B00023P44M,"David Suchet brings Agatha Christie's Poirot to life as no other actor has.  The stories are marvelous; the supporting cast is wonderful, and the picture quality is good.  However, there are problems with the sound.  I am hearing impaired and the sound on these DVDs is unusually low and indistinct which makes the accents very difficult to understand.  Amazon states on their web site that the DVDs are close captioned, but they are not.  The poorer quality of the sound and the absence of close captioning are problems for anyone with hearing difficulties.",1191196800,11,558,4.956989247311828
2059964,4,B00023P44M,"Dear Friends of Poirot:

Of the three stories on this DVD the above mentioned story is not too good from my standpoint.  Johnnie Waverly is lacking in the usual indepth focus these great stories normally have.

See it once and you seen it enough !  Had I recognized this item by its name, etc. I would not have purchased this DVD.

The other two stories are First Class!",1142035200,5,370,4.382352941176471
2059965,5,B00023P44M,"These mysteries are excellent.  I actually like them better than the original books.  David Suchet makes the character of Poirot much more understandable, and likeable.",1095552000,16,168,5.68
2059966,5,B00023P44M,"The excitement mounts (and shelf space decreases for collectors) as the 10th entry in the Hercule Poirot series appears! <Poirot 10> has, of course, all the superb production values of the other sets (both the short episodes on VHS and the longer ones on VHS and DVD) with the nearly perfect incarnation of Poirot in actor David Suchet. However even the most rabid fan must admit that two of the three plots are not top drawer.
  ""Murder in the Mews"" is the strongest entry with its twist on ""the murder set up to look like a suicide"" element. Toss into the salad the caddish Major (James Faulkner), the pompous politician (David Yelland) engaged to the victim, and the best friend (Juliette Mole), and you have all the ingredients for a solid whodunit with a good red herring.
  ""The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly"" telegraphs its solution too early in the proceedings for any interest to build up except for the question of How rather than Who. Also the precautions taken to prevent the crime are too unrealistic for credibility.
  ""Four and Twenty Blackbirds"" again uses a bearded character, which in series such as this one too often means someone in disguise. I am not revealing too much, since Poirot knows this halfway through, but the criminal in this case was simply too careless and there are ""too many clues."" A nude artist's model with a sense of humor, however, does not hurt.
  But mind you, these are still fun to watch as Suchet penguinwalks circles around Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson).",996192000,41,1509,4.776923076923077

8021496,5,B00023P44M,"The three 50-minute episodes on the Poirot Collector's Set Volume 10 were the second, third, and forth episodes of Series 1, originally aired in 1989. The episodes are ""Murder in the Mews"", ""The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly"", and ""Four and Twenty Blackbirds"". Since this was early in the series, the viewer is becoming familiar with Poirot's habits. We learn that ""the turned-down collar is the first symptom of decay of the grey cells,"" for example, and Poirot's low opinion of the countryside. His fussiness is becoming endearing. These are all good episodes, though ""The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly"" is weaker than the others. Even so, it offers some memorable humor. The episodes are:

On Guy Fawkes Night, Capt. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) remarks to Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Chief Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson), ""What a good night for a murder, hey?"", in ""Murder in the Mews"". And so Japp rings Poirot the next day to tell him that a Mrs. Barbara Allen has shot herself. Mrs. Allen lived with artist Miss Plenderleith (Juliette Mole) and was engaged to be married to a stodgy MP, Charles Leverton West (David Yelland). It was an apparent suicide, but some inconsistencies in the room lead Poirot and Japp to suspect an old friend, Major Eustace (James Faulkner), may have been involved.

""The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly"" takes a reluctant Poirot to the country after a Mr. Marcus Waverly (Geoffrey Bateman) consults him about kidnapping threats he has received for his young son. The would-be-kidnappers demand ransom or threaten that the boy will be taken at an appointed hour. Mrs. Waverly (Julia Chambers) is frantic, and Scotland Yard seems uninterested, so Poirot and Hastings head out to the Waverly estate to set the family's mind at ease. Meanwhile, Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) has perfected her filing system for Poirot's cases, each cross-referenced five different ways.

Poirot is introduced to a case through a dinner with his dentist in ""Four and Twenty Blackbirds"". Two elderly and estranged brothers, Anthony and the painter Henry Gascoin, die within days of one another in different towns. Their only living relative is George Lorrimer (Richard Howard), who manages a music hall in London and stands to inherit some of Henry's valuable paintings, which the eccentric painter hoarded during his lifetime. Poirot's curiosity is piqued when he learns that the habitual Mr. Gascoin twice visited his favorite restaurant recently but did not order his regular meal.

The DVD (Acorn 2004): There is a brief text interview with David Suchet and a brief text bio of Agatha Christie, the same that appear on the other Collector's Sets. And there are selective filmographies of five actors. No subtitles.",1291939200,,2724,5.114606741573033
