Also,  I loved the relationship between the two main characters and the story's theme. The music was also wonderful. I always enjoy listening to  Baek Ji Young.",1386979200,,267,4.782608695652174
208177,5,6162251020,OMG! I love love love this DVD series!!!! i WATCHED IT TWICE ON tv ALREADY AND i HAD TO BUY THE SET TO OWN!,1386115200,,107,3.5
208178,4,6162251020,Very fine drama - it is extremely sad and nothing much light happens after the first disc or so but I enjoyed it a lot.  The lead actor I had seen in Prosecutor Princess and I think he is a solid actor and I saw her in Shining Legacy and she just great too.,1384300800,2,257,3.759259259259259
208179,5,6162251020,"Princess' Man is an oustanding K-drama, everything about it is absolutely gorgeus: story, script, acting, pacing, music score, costumes, landscapes, photography and direction. I recommend it to everyone who wants to delight with the best of the world's cinematography.

I felt in love with this series. Furthermore, the chemistry between the lead couple is marvelous. A must watch!",1381276800,,381,5.568965517241379
208180,5,6162251020,GREAT STORY....THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WERE OUTSTANDING AND THE CROSS OVER WAS WELL DONE...LOVED IT AND HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IT 2X,1373846400,,131,5.285714285714286

208182,5,6162251020,"... and, I have watched over 70 K-dramas (FYI, I am not Korean).  Everything about this show is ""A"" -- the chemistry between the 2 leads, the storyline and pacing, and the cinematography.  I was already quite impressed by Moon Chae-won in ""Brilliant Legacy"" and so was not surprised by her great acting in this show.  Park Si-hoo did not impress me in ""Queen of Reversals,"" but I thought he was great in this show.  This was one show I did not use the ""Fast Forward"" button.  One final point:  this show did not overdo on ""Torture"" scenes ... hence, no need to FF.

In case you are looking for other Korean dramas, I have enjoyed ""My Girl,"" ""Goong"" (aka ""Princess Hours""), ""Tamra, the Island,"" ""Creating Destiny,"" ""Coffee Prince,"" and ... last but not least, ""A Jewel in the Palace"" (it was the first K-drama I watched and got me hooked).  Finally, if you are able to find ""Secret"" (aka ""Truth"" - year 2000), this one will blow you away -- excellent story and acting.",1366243200,31,967,4.485714285714286
208183,5,6162251020,"This drama is one of the best that I have seen so far. It quickly swept its way to my favorite top five along with City Hunter. A lot of the times I watch drama I fastforward through some scenes because the story begins to drag. However, this drama had me riveted to my seat just like City Hunter. The entire cast was wonderful and the two main lead characters, Se Ryung and Seung Yoo, had an amazing chemistry. Their love story was so beautiful and poignant. The more I watched Se Ryung's character unfold, I was somewhat reminded of Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice 1995. I quickly fell in love with her character as much as I did Seung Yoo's. The other princess, Kyung Hye, was also an impressive character along with several others like Jong and even Se Ryung's ruthless father. The story on a whole was compelling and I fell very much in love with it..so much so that I had to own it. It's the first Korean drama I've bought despite the fact that I've watched quite a few and really enjoyed quite a few.",1358467200,7,1058,4.403061224489796

208185,5,6162251020,This drama has got to be on my top 20 list for best Korean Dramas. This drama reenacts Romeo and Juliet and deserves a five star award. Se Ryung (Moon Chae Won) and Seung Yoo's (Park Shi Hoo)chemistry passionately lights up the screen. Everything about this drama pulls at your emotions from the beautiful music score to the final ending scene. Extremely riveting and splendidly acted drama.,1342483200,10,391,4.850746268656716
208186,5,6162251020,"I bought this set after reading a couple of helpful reviews by Esmeralda and ReadMeme. This Korean drama quickly made it to one of my all time favorites. I some feel enriched after seeing it. It's a great story that shows the how the power of unconditional love can heal someone suffering from deep emotional pain. The main actress did a superb job showing what unconditional love looks and feels like. You will not be disappointed if you watch this. My all time favorite is still Jewel in the Palace, followed by The Great Queen SeonDeok, then The Princess' Man, and lastly My Wife is A Female Shinobi.",1453334400,,603,4.592592592592593

stop. The actors were so convincing and the costumes excellent. I was
completely fooled by the ending; I did not expect that outcome...but I loved
the ending. Shipping was prompt and product DVD was very good. The
subtitles were very good also. One of my favorites!",1407888000,9,345,4.766666666666667

208204,5,6162251020,"I saw this on Hulu. It is a tear jerker with humor thrown in. It was fun getting to know these characters. I took two vacation days to watch 24 episodes and wanted to watch it again. The acting, the music score, the pairing up of these actors was superb. It's a very inspiring, character building story. I enjoyed it more than The Great Queen Seondeok, which I liked very much also. But The Princess' Man entertained me from beginning to end. I believe the south Koreans can teach Americans how to make a good movie without using sex, nudity and bad language. The English subtitles were done well. There were only 2-3 times I needed to rewind. By the way, I seldom give the maximum rating on anything.",1395187200,20,701,4.441860465116279
208205,5,6162251020,"This KDrama is, I believe my favorite so far. Never boring but totally addictive ! It will keep you ""glued"" to the TV until the very end.

Great acting and great chemistry between the main leads (Park Si-Hoo and Mun Chae-Won) .
Park Si-Hoo was amazing as Kim Seung Yoo and so was Song Jong-Ho as Shin Myun.

Such a captivating story ! It has already been added to my collection !",1388707200,11,379,4.25

7802676,5,6162251020,"It is a great K-drama, superb acting of the entire cast. Very well thought character development which makes it catch your attention from beginning to end. Yes, the ending may not have been that great but is satisfying. The music is also fantastic but unfortunately unavailable at this time at Amazon.

What captivated me most is the strength and determination of the personality of the main female character. She never wavered or hesitated to stand up for what she believed in, even to the point to break her blood ties to her father (this, for most of the Asian cultures is really BIG, unimaginable last resort, action a person can take to stand for what they believe is right and means more than forfeiting one's own life) and her unconditional, unshakable love.

Will not spoil by giving details of the story. One must see it as it develops and be captivated by the story as the viewers are.

Watched it several times already and enjoy it all the time. Way worth the price (do not buy cheaper versions of this drama; it deserves every cent you spent in a good quality product). Highly recommended",1498953600,2,1100,4.65979381443299
