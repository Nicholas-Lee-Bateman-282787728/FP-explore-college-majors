8449645,5,B004ZEDJEQ,"This is a presentation of the story from which The King`s Speech grew from.

The coverage of George VI as he evolved from The Duke of York to George VI ios exceptional.  The film and narration are excellent and gives a fine perspective of the struggles which King George VI as he ultimately became, had to overcome.

I highly recommend this film for it`s historical content.",1401494400,,374,4.636363636363637

8449647,5,B004ZEDJEQ,"Having seen the Academy Award winning film, ""The King's Speech,"" I thought it was neat to know the actual story that inspired the film. It was also insightful to know that King George VI's speech improvements took place in two months, rather than years, thought he continued to see Logue through the years. It's also nice to know that Edward VIII was not as antagonistic toward his younger brother, as is depicted in the film. Finally, it's sad, but true to know that Logue's elocution methods could not help all the patients that were brought, or recommended to him.",1314489600,4,567,4.737373737373737
8449648,5,B004ZEDJEQ,"This is a WONDERFUL companion piece to the Academy Award Winning film ""The King's Speech"" and I'm grateful to the folks at BFS for making this available in the US. Though the BFS title is listed as ""The King Speaks"", the actual 50-minute film directed by David Barrie is ""The Real King's Speech"" - you will see that as it plays. But no matter - this is a fascinating extension of the all-too-brief featurette that was included on the DVD release of the Colin Firth-starring film from Sony (see my review of that film on Amazon.). The Sony film included one small except of archival footage of King George VI - the ""stuttering king"". Here we get more, as well as interviews with other patients of Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue. (Imagine being a patient of a doctor who is also helping British royalty?).

Of course none of the info and current interest in Logue would have come to light had Logue's grandson not discovered his personal papers in an attic a few years ago (see The King's Speech for that) nor had First won the Oscar for the film.

If you like TKS film, then I highly recommend that you watch this DVD. (There are no special features on it though.) If you haven't, get TKS and enjoy it. THEN watch this film.
