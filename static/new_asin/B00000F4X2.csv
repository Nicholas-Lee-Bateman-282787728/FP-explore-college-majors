7906762,5,B00000F4X2,"I remember seeing a couple of these movies years and years ago. The ones I always remembered were ""Judgement"" and ""12 Angry Men"". True, there were not in glorious color, had no special effects or todays hyped-up music in the background. But they had meaning, stories that were deep and held your interest and often, were part of history. I always remember Maximilam Schell as the defense attorney in ""Judgement at Nuremberg"". A very powerful performace. And Henry Fonda in ""12 Angry Men"", the way he managed to turn a jury around. These movies are worth seeing more than once and I'm very glad I finally bought this collection. The DVDs are excellent quality, better than expected.",1362182400,,681,4.829059829059829
7906763,5,B00000F4X2,"All of these films have stood the test of time.

Buy new or used.  You won't be disappointed.",1260662400,4,93,4.111111111111111
7906764,5,B00000F4X2,"The four movies included in this box are available at a steep discount from numerous Amazon Marketplace sellers -- around $10 for the set. All of the films are classics that were directed by eminent directors and that featured terrific stars: Henry Fonda as a juror with a conscience in Sidney Lumet's debut ""12 Angry Men,"" Spencer Tracy as a judge with a conscience in Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" and Kirk Douglas as a colonel with a conscience in Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory."" All take place at least partly in courtrooms, and all deliver powerful messages about prejudice and war. The weakest of the four is the all-star ""A Bridge Too Far,"" Richard Attenborough's overlong and overambitious World War II epic, though it certainly is worth watching as a lesson in history and in the futility and awful waste of warfare. There are no extra features on these discs except theatrical trailers, but the movies themselves are excellent entertainment, and you can't beat the price if you shop carefully. Snap them up, along with sets 1 and 2 in this series of great films from United Artists.",1260316800,5,1108,4.867724867724868
7906765,3,B00000F4X2,"There is nothing to say to the quality of the movies on the DVD they are all 5 stars, but the cardbox package, the plastic DVD box and DVD print are from very poor quality.
You would expect much more from this great collection from great studios...
It's good that they dropped the price.",1244246400,5,287,4.333333333333333
7906766,5,B00000F4X2,"frankly I bought this because it was available at a good price. And of course, I hadn't seen them :) ... This is collection is truly marvellous. enough has been said about 12 Angry Men so I'll let that be. The two moves which made a deep impression on me were Judgment at Nuremberg and Paths of Glory. While the PoG is not such a great print (it is a very old movie) it does not take away from the impact of the message. It made me sit up and think and when you really begin to look at it, it can be an allegory as the same thing repeats in everyday life too. J at N was a well crafted movie and even after so many years still has the power to make an impression.

If you don't own these movies, you should.",1224806400,10,707,3.9097222222222223
