7867035,3,6304173628,"David Bryan is a really good keyboard player, but the video is not very explicative. I think the most useful part is where he told a few, but very important tips he uses on his songs, about pentatonic skills, how to play along with the band, follwing the guitar or the drums, a little bit about rythm on the left hand, but he does not really go deep in the explaniation and the technique. The cameras miss a bit on the hands action. It could be very useful for beginers whit some base on playing the keybord.",998697600,,508,4.247422680412371
