8217460,4,B000V9KEDI,"While ""Escape By Night"" (1937) may not be classified as a ""great"" Republic programmer, at a fast-paced 64 minutes, it definitely ranks as one of the studio's more entertaining b-pictures.

 Jo, played by Steffi Duna, is the girlfriend of big city mobster Capper Regan. In broad daylight on a busy street, Jo finds herself a target for kidnapping by a rival gang. Luckily, she is saved by a small time crook named Nick, played by William Hall, who happens to be looking for a gang to join. In the process Nick is wounded, but manages to run off the would-be kidnappers.

Jo takes Nick back to her apartment where the gang's doctor treats his wound. In the meantime, Capper Regan arrives. He immediately makes Nick part of his gang, and then orders Jo, Nick and two of Capper's henchmen to go into hiding somewhere out of the city until things cool off.

Miles out of town, the crooks' car breaks down near a run-down farm owned by a blind old gentleman called ""Pops"" and his daughter, played by the beautiful Anne Nagel. The farm owner knows nothing of the past of the four people who come looking for shelter. The newcomers offer to help Pop fix up his farm in exchange for room and board in his rambling farmhouse. The deal is made and the work begins to repair the house, the barn, and the farm in general.

The days turn into weeks as Nick and Pop's daughter develop a relationship, while Jo and a local banker take a liking to each other. The two henchmen, one played by Ward Bond, decide that they like country life much better than dodging bullets in the city.

In the meantime, Capper Regan is wondering why his little band of gang members has not come back to the city and keeps giving him excuses to stay longer. Finally, his patience wearing thin, Capper and some of his boys decide to pay a surprise visit to the farm and investigate the situation for themselves.

I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie, but I can tell you that there is a good message here about people who are on the wrong side of the law becoming reformed thanks to some kind people providing moral support and positive reinforcement.

Anne Nagel, with her pale blue eyes and dark hair, was on loan from Universal to make this picture. During her long film career, Anne appeared in many movies; from classic Universal horror movies to romances, mysteries, and comedies. And the great Ward Bond was in countless movies; from little gems like ""Escape By Night"" to blockbusters like ""Gone With the Wind."" He was everywhere, and he always added his own special touch to each film.

Lastly, Alpha's print, while not prefect, is above average and the sound is good. So if you are looking for a ""mystery with a message,"" this film just might be your ticket.",1339372800,2,2736,4.522267206477733
