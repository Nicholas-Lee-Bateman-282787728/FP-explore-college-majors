8699200,5,B00CP6YNLY,"This is a quite competent, traditional 20th C. interpretation of the play with a cast of trained pros (a serious student of Shakespeare shouldn't care that they aren't movie stars or Doctor Whos).

It was staged for film: that's a good thing, as it isn't simply a part-film/part-stage production like many higher-profile Hamlets.  A few nice outdoor scenes add verve.  Houston is deeply invested as H. without overplaying it; in fact, with the perhaps inevitable exception of Laertes, there's very little scene-chewing, yet the film never feels leaden (considerable cuts help with that, of course, and I am usually into uncut work but on film it's hard to avoid).  Gertrude and Claudius are steady forces of authority and the former gets the bedroom scene exactly to my taste; it's emotionally raw, but there's no showoffy sexing-up here (which means it could be played for a classroom of younger students).  Polonius is not played for extreme laughs as many players since Cronyn have done; really, this may be the most ""experimental"" thing about the production in this day and age.

P.S. To the previous reviewer: the costumes were on loan from the RSC.  Check the credits.  One early establishing shot may have been of a Ren Faire or living history museum, but even if so, that is hardly an unwise use of their obviously small budget.",1382140800,3,1336,4.906666666666666
8699201,3,B00CP6YNLY,"The story takes place in Denmark. Hamlet the prince is informed by the ghost of his father that his mother and uncle were responsible for his father's death. His mother and his uncle get married before the funeral meat is cold. How will Hamlet deal with the situation and what effect will it have on others around him?

The clothing is strait out of a renaissance festival. They speak as to each other not to an audience. Not being popular actors you do not have to remember them in other presentations. Some of the dialog is skipped but enough is left in to capture the story. The film is cut more like a movie than a copy of a stage play. You will hear a background mob most of the time; one exception is the soliloquy on the rock. They do play around with double exposure during some scenes. Also there are some scenes where the camera focuses on the face while the character thinks; at other times people read out loud. They left in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. They took out Fortinbras.

I know most of the play by heart but sometimes the actors make it sound fresh. They do take an effort to not make it look like they are just going through the motions.

The DVD I saw is one hour and 54 minutes. Large screen show that this looks like a PAL conversion.
