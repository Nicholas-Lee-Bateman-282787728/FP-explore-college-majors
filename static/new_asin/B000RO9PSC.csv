Now, the thing is, is that it would be SOO much better if you actually had a ""Metal"" guitar and Metal effects box with Metal pick-ups such as ""Dual-Humbuckers,"" for that great sound. If you don't, like myself, i learned on an acoustic, it's o.k. because you still learn the techniques ect. He does mention all those things like AMPlifier but he does leave out ""Dual Humbucker"" Speed Metal ""Pick-ups."" ""IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EFFECTS BOX AND AND PICK-UPS. Ask the person who works at the Guitar Store to advise you on that.
Also, this is a very Beginners DVD. Although i've been playing for a couple years, with slim to no lessons, i still was glad that I made the purchase.",1246838400,2,786,4.503496503496503
8201977,4,B000RO9PSC,"ok i love rock house method
i love house of blues
both have helped me become a better musician with the multiple instruments i play
i would have given this dvd 5 stars which it does deserve if i wasn't so pissed that its the same dvd i bought from rockhouse method metal guitar level 1 which it is the first of a collection
and i don't mean its the same dvd as in he teachs almost the same things i mean its the same dvd they just copied the dvd onto another title
what a sham there should be a label warning of this ....how can you do that?!
i don't see a movie coming out for example requiem for a dream come out and then come out with another movie requiem for a nightmare.....and be the same movie and still sell

as you can see this is distrubing .......... now this dvd did have bonus features which the other dvd didn't ...... which was my like an avertising  of another dvd from rock house method ... on his hands of steel dvd there was three lessons which were good lessons...... but i own that too...........

just warning anyone who has these dvds already not to waste your money",1236643200,6,1090,4.180952380952381
