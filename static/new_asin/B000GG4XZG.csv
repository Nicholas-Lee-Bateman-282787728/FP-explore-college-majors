8131817,5,B000GG4XZG,"Our grandchildren (3 & 4 years old) have enjoyed this.  We have a VHS copy, which had several songs that were left out of this DVD.  We thought the songs were a good addition, so occasionally will play the VHS copy.  The story included about a trash truck called ""I Stink"" is the one often requested.  It is not as long as Mike Mulligan and probably suits their attention spans better.",1405814400,,385,4.380281690140845
8131818,5,B000GG4XZG,This was one of my favorite stories back in the day.  I am a teacher now and it is fun to introduce my students to these wonderful stories and illustrations!,1302220800,,157,4.233333333333333

8131821,5,B000GG4XZG,We have had very good luck with all of the Scholastic DVDs.  This is one of our son's absolute favorites.  The only segment he wants to skip is the title story.  All of the others he will watch over and over!,1200614400,,208,4.024390243902439
8131822,5,B000GG4XZG,"All the titles on this DVD are great.  My 3 yr old son has enjoyed them all for the last few years.  However, we only recently discovered the very entertaining ""Bonus Story"" on the disc... called, ""The Remarkable Riderless Runaway Tricycle.""  It is WONDERFUL!  My son watched it for days straight and now, months later, requests to see it at least once a week.  Even my 15 month old daughter is captivated. A gem for sure.",1197244800,,422,4.5
8131823,4,B000GG4XZG,"We had the VHS format for Mike Mulligan and Steam Shovel when my 19 yr old son was little.  There  was a cute song called ""No Steam Shovels Wanted"" as well as a couple of other catchy tunes.  Sadly, they are missing from the DVD version which I recently purchased for my 2 younger sons.  However, the story as per the book is still the same, and the DVD includes 3 other stories:  ""I Stink"", ""Trashy Town"", and ""Dot the Fire Dog"".",1182470400,14,430,4.195121951219512
