3530740,3,B001DHXSXU,"I am not a professional writer or critic but Ill just state  the facts of my opinions on this video . First ,If you are well informed about the Ramones already there really isn't any information you would not know anyways . If you have seen the other documentaries , interviews and perhaps read the books it is just more of the same info .If you are unfamiliar with the Ramones than This video does relay the basic story of the Ramones. The performances were descent except the audio in some performances  could have been much better. Soundchecks for the audio recording were probably rushed the night of the concert due to the fast pace stage changes. The highlight of the DVD is seeing Marky and CJ on stage together performing some Ramones classics for the first time in more than 8 years .I think the ceramony for the Johnny Ramone statue was edited too much for the video  or wasn't thurough but maybe for the better if there was a lot of down time that day .I rate this one a 3 out of 5 . At least there was footage recorded of these 2 events and if you are a Ramones collector than buy it .",1235433600,7,1097,4.264423076923077
3530741,4,B001DHXSXU,"There is some great music here. The first two bands play non Ramones stuff though, pretty poorly and a bit inappropriately.
The interviews too often intrude on the music.
Some of the interviews seem to repeat stuff from 'The Turn of the Century'.
It shows what a great cover band the HC Peppers are. Dee Dee would be proud of their tattoos, and some credit is given to Dee Dee's song writing genius. We see Daniel Rey play, what tales of Dee Dee could he tell?
Johnny's guitar technique could have been much better explored and there really is no historical stuff about him, belying the title.
His demise is dealt with sensitively enough and we get to see and hear a bit from his wife Linda, though there are no interviews with Johnny himself in his twilight years.
Joan Jet's, Judy is a Punk , is relegated to the credits, whilst it's  better than the Rollin's hollered one.
The guy from Rancid plays power chords.
Overall, better than some rockumentaries (recently tried to watch the appalling Sympathy for the Devil, and I'm a Stones fan!).
Not sure there is enough background stuff for the Ramones naive.
Like a Ramones concert, it makes you wish you'd been there though, so it's an effective production with a great ironic title; courtesy of Joey?
Three and a half maybe.",1234137600,2,1276,4.621145374449339
3530742,5,B001DHXSXU,"Johnny is a legend and he won't let ya forget it even in death. This DVD has the extra added bonus of *not* having famous hanger-on Legs McNeil in it. And as for the last heartbreaking 15 minutes, heck, I cried. Gabba.",1232755200,8,218,4.214285714285714
3530743,5,B001DHXSXU,"WOW!!! This is a very fitting way to say ""see ya for now, John"". We should never say goodbye to our friends, heroes or loved ones and this film proves that!! It is an amazing look back at not just Johnny Ramone but the music itself and the influence it has had worldwide for the last 30 years. Even though the last 10-15 minutes are absolutely heartbreaking, it is well worth multiple viewings for fans of the band as well as fans of music itself. Life is short and was even shorter for Johnny, Joey, and Dee Dee. But I know they just wanted to get to heaven before the rest of us so they would have time to rehearse. See ya soon fellas! HEY HO, LET'S GO!!!!!",1226880000,4,659,4.15625

8293450,3,B001DHXSXU,"I'm a Ramones fan, but my main reason for purchasing this DVD was because there are performances by 'X' and 'Joan Jett'. I didn't really care about the other bands featured, but I didn't mind watching them, and found that I enjoyed it for the most part. However I was very disappointed when at the end Joan Jett finally comes on and it's while the credits are rolling! What an insult to a great performer and artist! The picture is minimized while she is performing, so get this, you can see the credits! Whoever edited that was a moron.

I also thought it was dumb how while a performance was being shown it would abruptly cut to a scene of an interview right in the middle of it and basically have someone talking over the music. I thought that was very unnecessary and annoying. It would have made much more sense to either show an interview with the band and then cut to their performance or show all the interviews in one segment and then the show in it's entirety in the other.

All in all the DVD is definitely worth a purchase. Die hard Ramone fans as well as casual fans will enjoy it.",1398902400,,1094,4.331707317073171

8293455,5,B001DHXSXU,"The long and short is: I watched this on a whim on streaming netflix a few years back...and promptly bought almost every RAMONES cd there is...and even before buying the cds and hearing all the stuff other than the well known judy is a punk etc. I WAS a RAMONES fan right there. BIG TIME. If you like ""good"" rock/punk but never gave the RAMONES a proper spin in the cd player...i dare you not to be a die hard fan after watcing this. Triple dog dare you. And if you don't have to choke back tears at the last part of the dvd...you should just have your heart excised because its not working anyways. TOO TOUGH TO DIE. EVER. -THE END.

(P.S. - When i say ""good"" rock, im talking CLUTCH. Do yourself a favor and download the two songs ""(In the wake of) The swollen goat"" and ""Ghost"", or just go to youtube and hear those songs in particulair to start, and if you don't wanna hear more, have your ears removed too.)",1348099200,,912,4.211428571428572
8293456,5,B001DHXSXU,"Too Tough to Die began as a concert put together by legendary guitarist Johhny Ramone and his many friends in the music industry to pay tribute on the 30th anniversary of the original punk rock band The Ramones and raise funding for cancer research. The Ramones are not only among the most influential and beloved rock bands of all time, but are almost certainly the most famous band in history to never have a single legitimate smash hit. Countless bands imitated their way to massive success, but the originators of the punk rock art form kept paying their dues until the very end. But real music fans and the armies of musicians who first picked up an instrument and started a band immediately after hearing The Ramones know where it's at. With singer Joey Ramone having passed on in 2001 and original bassist/songwriter Dee Dee following the year after, Johhny and friends decided to commemorate the anniversary to pay tribute to the fallen heroes by planning a show to bring together many of the artists whose lives were changed forever upon discovering The Ramones. What wasn't planned was that by the time the concert came to pass, Johnny would be on his deathbed and unable to attend.

 Too Tough to Die is a documentary consisting of interviews, classic Ramones clips, performances from the all-star concert, and even footage from Johnny's funeral. The festivities of the concert are exhilarating and the extremely heartfelt tributes to Johnny Ramone's legacy were beyond moving to a fan like myself. I was holding back tears at times. There are certainly better and more complete Ramones documentaries out there, but there has arguably never been a better tribute. The centerpiece of the film are the performances.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers put on an energetic but uninspired performance of some middling Ramones songs to kick it off, which had me worrying that this was going to be as awful as the tribute album Johnny and Rob Zombie put together,""We're a Happy Family"".  Thankfully, The Chilis would prove to be the low point.

 In between songs and occasional during performances the film offers up interview segments where various musicians, ex-bandmates, friends, and family discuss the massive influence of the band and swap stories and anecdotes. It's very well done, but I do was angered a few times when a particularly killer performance was shoved aside. I also wonder about some of the bands choices for covers. Hell, X didn't even play any Ramones songs, they just played their own stuff. Come on now!  These songs aren't exactly hard to learn.  On the other hand, I was extremely pleased to see underrated punk goofballs The Dickies involved. It's cool that Johnny let a lesser known band take part in an event that they were literally turning big bands away from.  But the real highlights were the all-star jams. Ex-Ramones Marky (drums) and CJ (bass) took the stage with producer/songwriter Daniel Rey on guitar and were joined throughout the set by a parade of amazing artists. I can't say I ever expected to see Eddie Vedder of Pearl jam share a microphone with Tim Armstrong from Rancid with Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz busting a guitar solo. That's just great stuff. Steve Jones (Sex Pistols) and ex-Black Flag frontman Henry Rollins teaming up for a few tunes was damn awesome as well. But my favorite surprise was former Mighty Mighty Bosstones Dicky Barret and Lawrence Katz performing ""Bonzo Goes to Bitburg"", which is my favorite Ramones song ever. That performance was just tailor-made for me.  Too bad they talked over it.  Grrrr.

 At one point during the show, Zombie calls Johhny Ramone from the stage so that he can hear the crowd engage in the legendary Ramones chant ""Hey! Ho! Let's go!"".  It's a moment that those who were with Ramone at the time say brought him a huge amount of joy and relief to hear so many people still excited about the bandhe started so long ago. Two days later, he would be dead.  Hearing the testimonials of his friends and family was extremely touching. Johhny Ramone was known to be a very prickly character and his strained relationship with Joey is the stuff of rock and roll tragedy, but by all accounts he was a fantastic man to have as a friend.  Seeing the eulogies at his funeral from guys like Vedder and Nicolas Cage was great and it was actually painful for me to see the always-cheerful CJ break down, unable to even speak through the anguish over the loss of his ex-bandmate. Powerful stuff by any standard.

 The Ramones' legacy is one that hundreds of more successful bands would kill to ever have a chance of attaining. They are a unique musical phenomenon unto themselves and probably only The Beatles have influenced as many successful bands.  The bizarreness of the band of four is exceeded only by their sheer force of will.  None of them could even really play or sing, yet somehow they became one of the most influential bands of all time over a decades-spanning career. Friends and family say that Johnny literally willed himself to stay alive until the concert was through and Joey refused a feeding tube on his deathbed because he didn't want to ruin his voice.  These are REAL musicians who never let anything short of death stop them.  They may have passed away, but the reality is that the music will always be there.

Too tough to die.

Ever.",1285718400,16,5343,4.782608695652174
