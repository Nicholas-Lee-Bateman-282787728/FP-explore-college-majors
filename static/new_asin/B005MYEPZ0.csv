4839171,4,B005MYEPZ0,"From South American director Oliver Schmitz and screenwriter Dennis Foon comes a film adaptation of Allan Stratton's 2004 novel ""Chanda's Secrets"".

The film highlights the ongoing problem of AIDS in South Africa and how neighbors condemn neighbors who have it, how far families go to hide the truth of a family member who has it but also the problem of how many children are left to run a household and take care of younger siblings as their parent is sick or dying of the disease.

""Life, Above All"" was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival and was selected as the South African entry for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" for the 83rd Academy Awards.  And now ""Life, Above All"" will be released on Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack from Sony Pictures Classics.

VIDEO:

""Life, Above All"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 2:35:1).  Picture quality is fantastic as there is a lot of detail in this film. First, the colors are warm and vibrant!  Close-up shots of the character reveals the pores on the skin of the characters to seeing the detail in the homes from old paint to the dirty shack where Esther was living.  There is plenty of detail and the colors of the film really stood out!

Colors are vibrant, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, clarity and detail are very impressive with ""Life, Above All"".  Also, the cinematography (especially when Chanda goes to look for her mother) by Bernhard Jasper (""Open Water 2: Adrift"", ""Kiss Me Kismet"") is beautiful!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Life, Above All"" is presented in Northern Sotho 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The dialogue is primarily center and front channel driven.  I noticed that the music by Alli N. Askin and Ian Osrin occasionally makes it out to the surround channels but for the most part, the film is center and front channel and only when you see crowds or hear a vehicle pass nearby is when you hear those ambient sounds through the surround channels.  But the lossless soundtrack is crystal clear, not very immersive but for a film of this caliber, you don't expect to hear immersive sound.  If anything, the soundtrack is appropriate.

Subtitles are in English SDH and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Life, Above All"" is a film that is about the human drama and a film that captures a realistic situation that people are living with in South Africa.

According to AVERT, the AIDS epidemic has increased South Africa's mortality rates.  But the AIDS epidemic has had an impact on children and families as the children shoulder the impact financially and emotionally of the death of a parent(s) due to AIDS and HIV.

And unfortunately, due to the AIDS policy of the former president Thabo Mbeki's government, the government were directly responsible for a third of a million people who died in South Africa of HIV/AIDS, according to research done by Harvard University.  Mbeki believed that AIDS was caused by a virus brought on by poverty and the solution was not medicine but the alleviation of poverty in Africa.  Because he believed in this, South Africa would not benefit from free drugs or grants to help those who were sick with HIV/AIDS.  A pharmaceutical company offered to donate a drug to South Africa to prevent the transmission of HIV from a mother to their child during labor but the government restricted the use of the drug until December 2002.

With ""Life, Above All"", the film gives us a glimpse into how the epidemic has affected people in South Africa.  From neighbors condemning and not wanting anyone with AIDS to be in their hometown and also how children end up having to take care of the household and as the character of Esther is an example of the many young women who must become a prostitute in order to make income.

But also in the case of Lillian and the death of their baby Sarah, the death of the baby was because the child was HIV-infected.  While the film doesn't get polemic on the decisions that were made by South Africa's government, because people were not educated on AIDS as seen in the film, Lillian's husband believed that his wife poisoned the child through her milk.  And with traditional beliefs held by some people in South Africa, the troubles she caused has brought evil to her family and because of that, her child has died.

So, this film is indeed a sad portrait of possibly a time back then when people were less educated but also a time when these unnecessary deaths could have been prevented.

But looking back at ""Life, Above All"", what is most amazing about this drama is how the the main talent of this film were able to do a fantastic job without having any acting experience.  The young Khomotso Manyaka who plays Chanda does a fantastic job and each time she is onscreen, she manages to play her role as if she was Chanda.  The fear in her eyes, the concern towards her mother and everything is captured onscreen quite wonderfully.

Also the women of the film, Lerato Mvelase as Lillian and Harriet Lenabe as Mrs. Tafa also pull-in a commanding performance as we see through these characters a grasping of straws of trying to survive while facing financial burden, Mrs. Tafa silently doing what she can do have her good friend gone from the neighborhood (as rumors continue to grow about Lillian's illness).

If anything, the efficacy of this film is due to the patience of director Oliver Schmitz who made sure he got what he wanted from the new talent.  And it helps when you get the right people to play their respective part.  The casting of Khomotso Manyaka as Chanda and casting the two women, along with the young Keaobaka Makanyane (Esther)...it was a grand slam for casting in my opinion!

While we know that South Africa (and many other countries) have problems with the AIDS epidemic, ""Life, Above All"" is a film not about death but about hope.  Possibly hope that this film will contribute to educating many about knowing the facts of AIDS instead of ignorance and wanting to hurt the families who are dealing with this deadly disease.  Instead of throwing stones, if you are a God loving society, why not just pray for those who are sick.",1323993600,4,6661,4.7229437229437226

4839175,5,B005MYEPZ0,"This moving film is based on the book `Chanda's Secret's' by Allan Stratton and has been adapted for the screen by the much talented Oliver Schmitz (Paris Je te'aime). It is the story of Chanda played with great ability by first time actress Khomotso Manyaka. Her father is dead and her mother has remarried a no good alcoholic who has borne him three more children, Chanda is the eldest and so when her mother becomes `ill' she takes on the role of mother, carer and worrier for the whole family.

The step father is an alcoholic who has forgotten why he started drinking but not where to go for it and drunken `extra marital conjugation'. He also blames his wife for the death of their youngest child, but is still able to steal the funeral money for his own ends.

Into this mix Chanda has an only friend called Esther; this poor soul has no-one, no hope and no money. She ekes out an existence by selling her under age body to predators who stop at the local lorry park. Her `lifestyle choice' as some would call it means that she is cast out by the community. This community also believes in witchcraft, superstition and quack doctors. They also believe that `The Disease' -HIV is a punishment from God and that the person with it is possessed. Chanda is judged by the company she keeps and because she wants to do what is right she too gets judged.

This is a beautifully acted , directed and photographed piece of cinema, the story itself would have been compelling enough but so much more is thrown into the mix, that would be spoilers if divulged, that this becomes something special.

Whilst the film deals with the unfounded prejudices of South African society and some very cruel people, this is also a story of love and devotion as well as hardships that are so alien to us in the `west' but are an every day occurrence for far too many in the wider world. For serious world cinema fans this is an absolute must see, it is in Northern Sotho with sub titles in English; highly recommended.",1387843200,2,2001,4.489010989010989

4839177,5,B005MYEPZ0,"Life, Above All is not a film for the faint of heart. This gut-wrenching South African film, adapted from Alan Stratton's novel Chandra's Secret, is a fictional thread in a very real piece of South Africa's fabric, namely, children orphaned by AIDS. Chandra is a 12-year old girl, living with her mother and two younger siblings fathered by another man who is an alcoholic that returns to visit his children unexpectedly at random intervals. She lives in a village where gossip is the lifeblood of the community, coupled with a heightened sense of propriety and pharisaism. Life, Above All gives us the story of Chandra, who must face adult challenges as a young girl, must stare death in the face and yet remain true to herself. And more importantly, it asks us to question our prejudices.

The opening scenes of Life, Above All show Chandra having to arrange a funeral for her youngest sibling, who just died in infancy. We immediately see Chandra, as a young girl, forced to carry the responsibilities of a household's head because her mother is incapacitated and both her father and her step-father gone. Mrs. Tafa, their next door neighbor, plays the role of a helpful aunt. Chandra's mother is sick and they go to visit a doctor, but that doesn't help. Eventually, building up to the climax of the film, her mother leaves for her hometown in another village. In the meantime, Chandra takes in a girl who was forced into prostitution, much to Mrs. Tafa's consternation and the scandalization of the village.

Chandra keeps on trying to get ahold of her mother via telephone to ascertain the date of her return, but it seems almost impossible. It is revealed that Chandra's mother has HIV/AIDS and will not be returning in order to spare her children from stigmatization. The film's portrayal of the deep prejudice against those with HIV/AIDS is a searing condemnation along the same proportions as The Crucible. It is more like a witch hunt, but this time without a trial.

Chandra travels to her mother's hometown, against Mrs. Tafa's wishes, only to find that she's been exiled by her own family. Chandra finds her mother in the outskirts of the village, waiting to die. In one of the most touching moments in the film, Chandra cradles her mother and gives her water using a wet cloth. She vows to bring her mother home, but her troubles are not over yet.

Chandra returns to the village with her mother via an ambulance, and all the neighbors come out of their homes and begin causing a ruckus, verbally abusing Chandra for bringing her infected mother into their presence. Mrs. Tafa, next door, hides behind her window blinds and begins her transformation as she is torn between her desire to protect Chandra, while also fearful of what the neighbors will think and how she will be perceived by their tight-knit community.

Ironically, this village is ""Christian,"" in that most people are shown singing in the church choir and attending service at various intervals. Simultaneously, there is a syncretism occurring between indigenous shamanistic folk religion and Christianity, which is portrayed in a scene where Chandra's family hires a witch doctor to cast out her mother's sickness. But it is these ""Christians"" that condemning Chandra and her mother, fearful of the stigma it will bring. They were already wary of the prostitute living with them, but now they have had enough.

Then came Mrs. Tafa's conversion moment. She steps out of her house and plants herself between the mob and Chandra's house, bravely calling them out for their hypocrisy. Mrs. Tafa ridicules them for the scandalous things they do behind their own doors, but that no one talks about. In essence, let the one without sin cast the first stone.

The biblical parallels (John 8) are so clear that I would be inclined to say that the filmmakers must have wanted to draw them. After Mrs. Tafa's challenge, much like in Jesus' situation, the mob disperses, some in true repentance and others angrier than ever. Christian charity, the kind that Jesus would recognize, is not merely helping out respectable people when you have the resources and the time--Mrs. Tafa taking Chandra and her siblings in when Chandra's mother left--but taking in the lowly, the disreputable, the scandalizing.

This is the challenge of Life, Above All. Will those infected with HIV/AIDS be ostracized from society or will they be treated and welcomed as those made in God's image, for the sake of the sick as well as for their children who face the life of orphans.

4839179,5,B005MYEPZ0,"The first reviewer gives an excellent synopsis of the film.  Having visited S.A. I was pleased to recognize the ""neighborhood"" as realistic - including the neighbor party scene - one of the brighter, fun moments of the film.

(don't want to add spoilers) Chanda's courage to rescue and continue to love her friend Ester as well as the love she has for her mother is a beautiful thing to watch.  She is quiet, compassionate and sure of herself.  Not many girls in the west her age would have the maturity demonstrated by Chanda in this movie and there's a lesson to be learned by young and old alike to not be part of ""the pack"" - think for yourself.

Acting is touching but honestly only serviceable by and large. However, where  the performances ocassionally fall short, the actors reflect a reality with absolute believability.
The Aids epidemic in South Africa is no secret, but the lengths people will go to distance themselves from being knee deep in that reality is the theme presented here. The trials the main character braves are inspiring. And the ending is so uplifiting. This film will make anyone with a heart cry.",1350432000,,619,5.009708737864078

8479997,5,B005MYEPZ0,"For a blueprint on why the HIV pandemic has shown such extraordinary resilience in southern Africa, look no further than Life, Above All. This beautifully shot and expertly crafted film ticks off each of the layers of protection that a society should have to protect itself and shows each are badly in need of repair. The point of view is from a young girl living in a township on the edge of a city, and she is inundated by rumor, ignorance, death, and temptation swirling in a melange that renders her schooling an easily forgotten distraction. On a deeper level, Life, Above All explores the war between fearful superstition and cool fact, and their proxies against this backdrop. It strikes a careful balance between sentimentality and detached regard, avoiding the trap of tragedy porn. The subject is a devastatingly tragic one, but it suggests a way through by embracing unvarnished honesty. There is no other way to deal with adversity of any kind other than head-on, and it can be said that AIDS has been less damaging to Africa than the ignorance that nurtures it.

Khomotso Manyaka leads a talented cast as Chanda, a young girl who is strong enough to face buying a coffin for her dead little sister. In the first of many unsettling images, she surveys a room with an unreasonably good selection of oblong boxes just the right size for an infant. She is sharp, and able to discern a growing sense of loss in her mother beyond mourning. She is sick, and her husband is far sicker; he whiles his time away in the shebeen drinking away whatever money he can steal from his wife while lamenting that she poisoned them all. The community is filled with suspicion and mutual loathing, treading heavily upon the empty cliche of how a village raises a child. They can see the illness, and word spreads wildly about the curse. Harriet Lenabe gives a striking performance as a neighbor who truly means well while fueling the rumors in an attempt to manage them. Her magnetic presence suggests great skill at manipulating public opinion.

The drama rests on how Chanda copes with the coming realization that her mother is dying, and her arc is in realizing the futility of comfortable delusion. If you work in a South African hospital, you will be astounded that nobody dies of AIDS. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, trauma, diarrhea, even old age in people as young as fifty are the only causes. Everybody knows, and in Life, Above All, the word remains just under the tongue of the community. They know, but ignore, and refuse to face the problem tearing their world to pieces. The fear is palpable, and effectively blocks prevention education while casting a protective barrier behind which superstition and rumor run wildly. This is why people believe sex with virgins or small children cure HIV or that condoms spread disease. In one remarkable scene, Chanda accompanies her mother to a doctor who is famous for curing the bug. She surveys his certificates, asking him Are these your degrees? As he responds proudly, she notes balefully that they are all sales awards  not a degree in sight. Even in fear of death there is a robust market. Chandas mother attends a sangoma (traditional healer) who puts on a show of curing her, all the more repulsive for her having paid for it. Every person who reaches a clinic or hospital has been to one of these thieves first, often many times before their first trip to an actual doctor.

Nothing about the structure in this society responds properly to the crisis. Family members are made to hate and fear one another; the community treats those who may be infected with contempt or even murder; the health care system is pushed beyond the breaking point; elected officials fail to acknowledge the epidemic or actively feed it with their own inspired levels of ignorance. Life, Above All focuses most of all on the intimate moments that fall victim as friends and loved ones stab each other in the back in public while apologizing in private. The shame is buried so deeply that it covers everything in sight.

And so it goes that the response to AIDS begins where any proper response to a catastrophe must  at home. An economic disaster must be remedied one saved business and consumer at a time; a political failure is fixed voter by voter; ruined land is repaired acre by acre. Chanda responds to the hatred of her community with her own house, making it one of disease and compassion. The response by one of her family members is heart wrenching, and transcends the drama into a much larger point. Some may see this as unrealistically hopeful, but only if taken literally  this is from the point of view of a young and somewhat idealistic girl who has learned from her mistakes, starting with understanding she has made them. This is a work of emotional resonance that is involving and universal. South Africa may have responded poorly to its challenge, but every nation has dealt feebly with the cataclysms in their midst, and the blame rests on every member of society who is comforted by their delusions.",1479600000,,5047,4.761142857142858

This deeply moving, emotional, and heart felt story took me to Africa and the acting was so real, so believable...that I felt like this was REAL sort of like a documentary.  Kudos to all the actors and actresses...but major kudos to the young actress that plays Chanda.  Chanda puts life above all...AIDS, stigmas, outcasts, gossip, image, shame, contagiousness, death, etc.  She has a heart for people, love, true friendship, and life.  She ensures some traumatic life experiences with courage.  Her mother has contracted AIDS from a no good stepfather who leaves the family, she deals issued with her baby sister because they don't have the same father, she is wise and intelligent beyond her age and it comes through as she communicates with a Doctor that has three degrees and a neighbor who is worried about what the neighbors will think and say.  Her best friend has no one and resorts to being a whore for truck drivers and is brutally beaten, raped, and left for dead...and when no one else would help her...Chanda goes the extra mile to help and proves her true friendship.  Many things happen along the way on this journey, but the ultimate is what she endures to bring her mother, who is dying from AIDS, back home despite what anyone says, cares, or thinks.  If anyone knows the reality of being an outcast due to AIDS in Africa...then one can imagine how deep this issue cuts to the core.

I loved it and get teary eyed just thinking about this movie.  The neighbors who sang towards the end had such angelic voices...the gates are opening...Heaven's gates are open.  If you are looking for laughs and fluff...this movie is not for you.  If you can handle real life issues and enjoy a shero, and a movie that inspires you to be a better human being...this is it!!",1419724800,,1894,4.634730538922156
