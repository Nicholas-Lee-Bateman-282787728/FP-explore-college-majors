Its a good biography, but some of it was information back from 2003 or 2004, so some of it might be outdated or might be useless.  Either way its good, I mean for me it was ok.  But I kind of wish they would have talked more about his personal life and his second wife's mental unstableness.  But whatever!

Just enjoy!",1281484800,2,563,4.254716981132075

Students are much more visually driven these days and powerful archival film is a great way to stimulate discussion and analysis. I admit to approaching this Biography Channel take on Stalin with minimal expectations. I wasn't disappointed. Stalin's brutality and criminal responsibility for death and suffering starting from the introduction of the Five Year Plan in 1927 is of course on full display, as it should be. So is the August 1939 deal with Hitler that partitioned Poland and delayed war in the East. But how was such an ""evil"" man and regime able to break the Nazi war machine in Summer 1943 (Battle of Kursk), forcibly and ruthlessly transform a deeply impoverished backward society into a super-power, and begin the process of eliminating the hunger, disease, illiteracy, shocking poverty and dependency that made the former Czarist Empire into the first region of the Third World by the Russian Revolution of 1917? And what exactly is the connection between this transformation and the ruthless system introduced by the Bolsheviks (or maybe the Czars) and perfected by Stalin? How did it manage to save the Soviet peoples from virtually certain annihilation at the hands of the Nazis and make the Soviet state so powerful, then begin degenerating into a stagnant dead-end barely a generation later? None of these questions are raised, much less answered in ""Stalin: Man of Steel."" This film does provide a certain self-congratulatory satisfaction as noted by another reviewer, and I recommend for those who wish to affirm Cold War cliches and prejudices. For those interested in the realities of Soviet history in all their tragic nuances, however, Soviet-related episodes from the old 1970s British docu-series ""The World at War,"" available on DVD, is far superior to this hack-job. I also recommend the German historian Teodor von Laue's little book ""Why Lenin, Way Stalin, Why Gorbachev?"" as an excellent introduction into Soviet history that spares nothing in its critique of Marxist-Leninist ideology or the Stalinist terror, but avoids the travesties and nonsense of the Soviet Union-as-Evil Empire with Stalin as the devil you get most other sources. Including the one being reviewed here.",1256947200,8,2322,5.1946666666666665
