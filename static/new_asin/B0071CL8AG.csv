8508245,2,B0071CL8AG,"This is a disappointment. Both of these movies are presented in drastically cut versions. Cyclone Ranger is a 60 minute movie, Stallion Canyon is a 72 minute movie. Both combined on this DVD run LESS than 1 hour. The Amazon listing shows a run time 2 hours 12 minutes. Not true at all. The movies themselves, are fun to watch... quality is so so. Just beware that you're not getting whats advertised. Oldies.com & Alpha Home Entertainment should be ashamed.",1510876800,,457,4.725

8508247,2,B0071CL8AG,"I bought this DVD for the Stallion Canyon as it was filmed in Kanab, Utah, and it was the first movie for Ken Curtis. The quality isn't very good and it isn't that great a movie. But being familiar with Kanab, it was fun to watch a movie made there (over 200 movies and TV shows have been filmed in and around Kanab, Utah).",1353888000,,323,4.0625
8508248,1,B0071CL8AG,"I ordered this movie because my grandfather is one of the main actors. I gave one away as a gift to his daughter and kept one for myself. I have seen the movie a couple of times but when I watched this I was confused because parts that I distinctly remembered were not in the movie. I thought maybe I did not really remember so well. Then, after my aunt sat down this past weekend with my uncle and two other aunt to have a movie night and watch it, she call because most of the movie was missing. I am hoping for a refund because I am not interested in the other feature. Bought it strictly because my grandfather whom I knew and love so much was in it.",1345593600,,654,4.038461538461538
