5348020,5,B009LDCWN0,It always makes me laugh and laughter is the best medicine!  I also like that each show is somewhat independant so I can watch them in any order and not be lost.,1362441600,,161,4.03125
5348021,4,B009LDCWN0,"Whitney still has it, just not as much as she had it last year. The show was fantastic and funny last year but this year it's kinda dragging, but is still good. I would recommend watching it if you have some spare time and want a little entertainment. I like how the show discusses the sticky situations couples get into and that is fun to watch those situations play out but it could use some more gusto for the funny spins on these problems they experience. Again, I still like it but I don't love it.",1361664000,,503,4.25

5348025,2,B009LDCWN0,"So far with this season has been a complete let down especially after season 1. A complete sophomore slump. I will continue to watch it and hopefully it will get better.

The jokes are predictable and not funny. Whitney's acting isn't too good and she is coming off more needy than in the first season, maybe because of the whole ""marriage"" thing. She should be called Whiney instead.

Other characters:
*Roxanne and Lilly are boring.
*Neil is nonexistent this season.
*Mark is okay so far but he has barely any lines.
*Alex is on point with all the jokes and is the best part of the show in each episode. Maybe the writers give him the better lines and he actually tries with the show. He is the reason why I gave it the other star.

Hopefully, I will get to update this and give this a higher star rating as the season goes on but so far, eh.",1354406400,3,844,4.29559748427673

5348147,5,B009LDCWN0,"I have been watching undatable since the first season. Now that both Whitney and Chris are both on that show it created a fantastic Whitney reunion. Whitney was very funny and anyone that is in a relationship should be able to relate to. While being funny, it can also be very realistic with exs showing up and best friends that create issues in the relationship.",1459209600,,363,4.6

Whitney Cummings and Chris D'elia have amazing chemistry.  Also the entire cast is funny.  I just wish this show hadn't been cancelled.  Not sure who at NBC makes these decisions but cancelling this show was a bad call.  I feel like it just got started and was on its way to becoming the next ""Friends.""",1454198400,,443,4.615384615384615

It was really fun to watch these characters grow and change. It would be super awesome if Netflix or Hulu picked it up and made more!!! Please!! Haha seriously though it's one of those shows that you could sit down and not want to stop watching until the end!! And laugh your butt off the whole time!,1446768000,,420,4.397435897435898

5348204,3,B009LDCWN0,"**Mild Spoilers ahead**

First of all, I'm a big sitcom junkie and I truly enjoyed season 1 of Whitney. It was never close to being up there with the greats, but it had an unorthodox, modern story style, good performances, and a lot of big laughs. It culminated in Whitney and Alex pretend-marrying each other, which was the perfect conclusion to what had been an interesting season of unorthodox romance.

Now that the show has been cancelled, I figured it was time to warn people about the buzzkill of season 2.
I'm not sure if it was the change in showrunners or the mostly different writing staff, but while the tone of the show remained, its quality and level of humor dropped considerably.

Whitney Cummings and Chris D'Elia were perfect for the parts they played, but those parts soon became ones of odd desperation as they dealt with all the weird revelations the writers threw at them.
After Whitney's mom comes along in season 2's first episode to pop the balloon of their fake-marriage high, we were soon informed in more early episodes that--

Oh yeah, Whitney has a heart condition that Alex never knew about. (Come out of left field much??)

And oops, Whitney was actually engaged to someone else besides Alex in the first season. ?????????

And oh yeah, Whitney has a half-sister, a character who seemed to be created out of thin air just so the show could make a not-so-subtle plea for understanding transgender choices.

The supporting cast had all the life drained out of their characters while they went through the motions of awkward scenes designed to give them something to do to fill out the episodes.
Mark went from being a funny cop to an inept bartender with the addition of Low Bar, a new set piece designed for the cast to have somewhere to hang out, a la Central Perk or Monk's Coffee Shop. His romancing of Roxanne felt so inevitable and lifeless, even with the help of the new character, R.J., who quickly turned from a suave romance expert to a desperate oddball.
Other than one instance of babysitting, Lily's character had nothing better to do than sit on a barstool balancing the ever-present bun on top of her head. I enjoyed Zoe Lister-Jones' performance as Lily in the first season, and it's a shame there wasn't more of a character for her to play in the second.
Not even Chelsea Handler as Whitney's therapist could survive the uncomfortable warping of the show's characters.

I gave the second season three stars because it does have a few laughs scattered among its awkwardness and the actors do well with what they're given.

If you loved season 1, I suggest buying the DVD set or the Instant Videos and re-watching those. Then only watch season 2 if you dare to spoil the series for yourself. To quote Whitney from the season 1 theme intro: You heard me.",1368403200,7,2798,4.659229208924949
