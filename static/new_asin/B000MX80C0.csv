8173337,3,B000MX80C0,"This is presented well with professional production quality. Kim Foley is friendly but chatting & allows her ""models"" to chat a bit much. It feels like an unedited makeover which feels like you're really there, each of the four women last 20 min for their makeover.
The women are a average weight, short haired brunette white woman in 50s?, an overweight, African American woman in her early 40s?, a slim, medium length, blondish woman in her late 40s?, and a slim, long gray haired woman who looks late 40s?.
She recommends almost all the same things, although different foundations in liquid, powder or airbrushed. She recommends eyelid primer for all, powder eyeshadow w/angled brush pushed into lashline instead of pencil, etc., the usual basic neutral colors only eyeshadow, light blush, and light pink/peach lipgloss. Oh, she did do contouring which is using a light brown shadow under the jaw & under the apple of the cheeks to create depth w/the darker color to distract from second chin & create a more defined cheekbone.
The hair she would fluff up & pull to the side with hairspray & other hair products & use a brush/hairdryer in one to make slight wavy hair.
She did a great job for them, but otherwise there wasn't enough  difference in tips & their makeup, which was better then nothing, looked always the same as hers.
She has her site under her name: kimfoley",1213747200,,1376,4.781512605042017
