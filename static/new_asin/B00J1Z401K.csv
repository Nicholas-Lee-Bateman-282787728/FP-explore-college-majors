I don't need a lot of blood and guts to enjoy a horror movie... I prefer for the plot to do the work and that's exactly what this movie does... Love the suspense, and the lead actress does an amazing job of making us feel it. Overall, plan to watch if again!",1398038400,,380,4.0131578947368425
6308757,2,B00J1Z401K,"The title cover and description gave this one potential, that's about it. Pretty predictable plot. Acting was subpar. Wouldn't want to see this one again.",1461024000,2,154,5.2
6308758,3,B00J1Z401K,"Now here's a movie that starts "" nowhere"" and ends ""nowhere"". A couple moves into a home, seemingly out in the middle of ""nowhere"" but next to another house. The boyfriend invites a ton of friends for a party their first night there...(lot's of things to be P.O.'ed about there, huh?)
Bit by bit the friends are taken out by the ""Blood Widow"" who ""lives"" there, and are going there or She is coming to the new neighbors...not really for a welcoming committee. Little is actually known about the widow, other than what the main character reads in bits and pieces..along with a few token pictures she finds around the house...this kid was molested in the ""worst ways"" is all you can get...
There is no phone service..no one believes in getting the heck out of there, and most everyone who goes to this new home get slashed, decapitated, limbs severed, or just plain gutted. Now I can go along with a story for the most part, but there are SO MANY gaping holes to this story, AND the blood widow, that ANYBODY with an ounce of sense would start to head for the door, or at least to the remote control to find another flick to watch.  WHO is she?... HOW has she gotten this far?...WHY does she have a murdering hate for anyone close by?..
WHY is she there?  WHY hasn't anybody alerted the authorities, THAT A BLOOD THIRSTY  murderer lives next door..?
The photos of her look VERY recent, much less a little girl, so WHY is a grown woman playing house in an empty house...looking for hacks to splatter?
EVEN the realtors know about the house, but NOBODY is interested in putting a call to the cops and say...Something MIGHTY PECULIAR is going on here, Sheriff...Even the realtors bite the dust...(which was the highlight of the movie for me).
What could have been a real good movie was left to no imagination, no REAL fore thought, and attention deficit disorder...
the murderer must have incredible powers of speed, as well as the ""hang in there"" ability to suffer blows, no matter how poorly thrown.
She moves like lightning to get to the next place where the next victim is escaping to, ready to be slain by this super powered murderer.
At  the end, (which was a long time coming), there was NO closure, EVERYONE was killed..the main character woman was pummeled to death,
And as sick as this last death was, I SCREAMED AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS  ""Kill me, too"", for being stupid enough to watch to the end. Knowing all along that it would work up to a sequel.  Reading the credits, I was interested in seeing that this was made by donations from a multitude of people. Most of them should be asking for their money back by now. If they saw it, they would have sent an enforcer to COERCE the money from these ""movie makers""...
Take my advise, ONLY WATCH this if you have nothing else to do, and 1 hour and 22 minutes to throw away...OR if you have recently been prescribed a hallucinogenic drug, and want to ruin your high.
There is no closure, only the idea that ""she"" will be back. Time to invest in A GUN.",1461024000,2,3003,4.450909090909091
6308759,2,B00J1Z401K,"I was rooting for this one because it was shot by a couple of home town boys, but I couldn't do it. The commentary is interesting, but not very informative. The movie itself plays like a standard low budget slasher with a great looking villain that's just not very interesting. The acting is as sharp as a dull butter knife. Did appreciate that there wasn't the obligatory ""wise old person explains the killer's backstory"" scene. I hear there's a sequel, so someone got paid.

This could be because I have witnessed some absolutely AWFUL low budget slasher fare, but I must say I really like the idea of a female villain. The acting sucked in a lot of parts. The sound quality was bad. That being said, I don't ever watch these movies for the potential Oscar nominees or the astounding surround sound goodness; I watched it to see a crazy chick with awesome weapons hack up a bunch of idiots.

6308770,1,B00J1Z401K,"Oh my gosh...BE WARNED: This film is absolutely TERRIBLE.

 In the first 20 minutes I couldn't tell if I was more irritated by the amateurish lighting (I'm not kidding here...it looked like somebody had removed a shade from a side-table lamp and followed the guy shooting the video to light the darker scenes. The shadows were just overwhelming everything)
or whether I was about to be driven insane by the people selected to portray the underdeveloped characters. NOTE: I'm refraining from calling the individuals in the film actors in an attempt to avoid insulting the professionals who actually work to develop themselves in this particular profession.

I'm not sure if the absurd script simply did not provide enough information to help the people in this film develop the characters or if they were simply given the limited direction to improvise with each other in every scene. Either way, these characters (all of them) are unfortunately laughable at best.

PLEASE! take my advise...I should have bailed after those first 20 minutes. Unfortunately...I'm a horror genre fanatic and I've always been able to find something redeeming in most every horror film I've watched. TRUST ME...there is NOTHING redeeming here, you will never get the time back that you waste watching this train-wreck of a movie.",1433980800,2,1307,5.122065727699531
6308771,3,B00J1Z401K,"The story of Blood Widow is pretty mediocre but the new killer it creates is as memorable as Chromeskull, a brutal, unapologetic force of unnatural death. A stereotypical group of friends meet a brutal end at the hands of a homicidal maniac in a mask is no new ground in horror but then again no one is wanting new ground, just new monsters and new bodies that hit the floor. Blood Widow gives us that. The acting is passable, with some proving better than others in bring the characters to life. The origin story and dialog in this film treads lightly with some spots fighting to hold true to the story but all that is forgiven in this slice em and dice em flick. The cast are believable enough, the action keeps your attention and the production is enough make the film watchable.

Blood Widow is a low budget but it doesnt pretend not to be. Even with the lower budget Buckhalt still goes full steam into the kill scenes giving fans what they want-blood and gore and screams. Some deaths are not as memorable as others but this film gives good kills. The effects are noticeably cheap but fun to watch. The blood is plausible, the gore is face-forward and the kills are at times creative. The killer does seem a little too polished for the setting but given the backstory and implied origin tale that got the killer to this point in life you can accept the polished costume-y style Blood Widow takes in this film.

Still there are some issues in Blood Widow, the camera does hold on the cheaper effects a bit too long which could turn off more mainstream horror fans, the origin story is on the weaker side of horror mythos when comparing to other modern slasher icons, and some moments have less than stellar sound quality so be warned. Over all though, I found Blood Widow, fun, entertaining and dark with no camp or extreme cheese aspects aside from the unavoidable like clich characters and screaming while fake blood is spraying everywhere. Check it out if you are an indie or low budget horror fan.",1432080000,,2006,4.538674033149171

There will be a lot of times where you might say, ""Don't go up there!"", or shout at your TV because of someone's stupidity. There are a few comedic scenes, as well. It adds variety.

6308791,4,B00J1Z401K,"""Blood Widow"" is an atypical old school slasher flick with a low budget but a decent body count. You can tell right away that the film looks like the location shooting could have been shot anywhere and that the cast are a bunch of unknowns. But the good news is that almost immediately you want these people dead and eagerly anticipate Blood Widow's choices of edged weaponry to dispatch each one creatively. Blood Widow uses a scythe, Kukri knife, a cat o'nine tails, an axe, and blunt objects to slash, smash, and eviscerate her victims. As usual, one woman fights back and makes it until the end. But the lessons of never turning your back on a psycho and returning to the scene for revenge take a gruesome toll. Blood Widow spares no one, not even the heroine. She is also the first serial killer that cleans up her mess between kills! The SPFX are old school but in some cases hilarious and other times chilling. A woman getting her legs whipped with the cat o'nine tails is particularly disturbing as torture. But overall this is a worthy cut rate horror film.

Cheesy dialog (""...just stay here then. <beat> Come on.""), very limited acting ability, strange direction (why did every shot of Christopher de Padua hang for 4-5 beats?), production design leaning toward crushed blacks, and sound design that makes you go 'wha...!?'.  Probably the worst is the sound:  Full soundtrack and the characters lips are moving, but nary a stitch of dialog is making it out of the speakers for about half the movie.  Characters in the foreground can't be heard, but those in the background or on the phone come through loud and clear.  Had to turn on CC to follow the dialog, the problem was so bad.

Clearly a freshman effort from someone at the bottom of the directorial learning curve.  (BTW, just for future reference, people tripping on acid typically will NOT wander into creepy dark old houses by themselves while laughing like loons...even with their personal Buddha statue.  Instead, she would have been chasing the flashlight beam around the meadow...)

Probably the best part was the Blood Widow herself, played by Gabrielle Ann Henry.  With no dialog (and only the thinnest of back stories), her physicality did achieve a shudder on occasion.  Good job, G.

6308810,3,B00J1Z401K,"By rollercoaster, I don't mean excitement. I mean my overall enjoyment of it. It's not shot on video, decent film qualtiy, actually, so it didn't have the classic elements of the horrorible subgenre but it kept bringing it to mind. Another element of the horrorible subgenre it did not have was the awkward scene transitions. The acting was a notch above those movies also though not by much. Also, the camerwork wasn't horrorible: no unnecessary zooms on someone's face till you see their pimples, or zooming in on some token prop to underline ""atmosphere:"", or just following people around with no thought to how the scenes were being framed..The lighting was decent too, unlike the horroribles. There was a little bit of shadows when there shouldn't be and too much light when there shouldn't be (lat the party), But it did not distract. So that leaves the story, especially the dialogue used to tell it. Again, it seems like the scenes were written off of a treatment vs. a script, The characters virtually fell from the sky. No nothing to flesh them out at all. The dialogue was irrelevant, when there was any. Instead of some real opportunities to craft tension, suspense, conflict, its left to a bickering couple to get us through to the action. What's with the trend of having a hen pecked boyfriend and a nagging, complaining, sullen girlfriend? Its lazy story telling. Gimme some real tension, some real suspense, and conflict, not relationship problems. I don't give a crap about whipped dudes and sphincterized beaches. The friends, except for the hippie chick (who didn't get to do much) were so uninteresting and dumb as rocks. I don't mean in their choices either, but their personalities, the little of that I got a remote glimpse of.. As opposed to the low budget ""The Killing of Jacob Marr"", there was zero chemistry between any of them and I honestly would rather hang out with the antagonist than any of them. Though I do have to say that I got some good laughs out of Kevin, whenever he screamed (I think that was his name; the effeminate Asiany looking guy). Instead of dedicating a little time to build some character development, or at the very least, some interpersonal relationship building that might bring to life the people and their connection to each other, instead they throw a huge party, with tons of extras, more 'no-bodies', to fill up the time with music, dancing, and more of the NOT meaningful dialogue (if there was any at all). But then it got better. It bumped to a 3 after the party, when the antagonist takes center stage. She was a worthy antagonist. Good look, good movements, good kills, good no talking, just straight up ninja, killing machine. A little more backstory would've been nice.  I dug this chick. The other characters were just cannon fodder for her homicidal awesomeness. I dreaded that it was too good to be true and anticipated with horror that a final girl scenario was going to play out. Satan forbid! At the end, I was yelling at the screen: yes, please, more, puhleeze!!!!!!! If there was ever a NOT a final girl, this whining, nagging..., was it. I won't spoil it and say if I got my wish or not...... Oh, its always a good laugh when, in these flicks, one of the victims faces the killer and screams, usually when hanging from a meathook or something,: ""You sick eff!"" Hahahahaha! Ya think they care much?! Suffice to say, there is something here, if you like rooting for antagonists, and like vicious kills. The camera doesn't linger long on them though, so I wouldn't describe it as gory at all. Just mean and bloody. Compared to many of the other low budget flicks, its definitely better. I did NOT watch it as a curiosity, to see what a home movie horror flick looks like. I watched it as a piece of legitimate entertainment and my rating reflects the enjoyment I got out of such: 3.5, at the end, (4 for just the end) though ranging from 2-3 up until the end. I did not round up to avoid inflating expectations. Hopefully this can get the filmmakers some deserved cash with which to make a Blood Widow: The Beginning, with some good script writers and actors. I do want to see her again..",1403827200,4,4161,4.653532608695652

I mean have any of those reviewers EVER seen a good movie before or are they all in the 7th grade and this is the first film that isn't Disney produced they've ever seen.

What did I expect though in a country that is totally full of brainwashed morons that think McDonald's is good food......or don't think anything of paying $150.00 a month of free television in order to watch 1980 and 1990 old movies and wall to wall non stop commercials.

6308818,1,B00J1Z401K,"10 reviews so far, ranging from 4 to 5 stars....BWUAHAHAHAHA... oh god, let me tell you now that those reviews have to have been written by people involved in this film, trying to trick people in believing this movie is worthy of anyone's time. I know it might seem like I'm making an accusation, and perhaps I am trolling, but no, just go check every other site you can find reviews for, especially something as trustworthy as say IMDB who right at this moment has the movie at 3.8 (And that's 3.8 out of 10 stars mind you) with just under 90 peoples votes. Trust me, I'm not the one lying here when I tell you this movie stinks to high heaven.

Ok, so, you can see the front cover. Yes, it does look very interesting! It looks like it's going to be a movie horror fans have wanted for years where a female slasher goes on a murderous spree while wearing a mask or something that could become an iconic look for the genre. Yes, these film makers got that part right. The picture of the front cover alone is enough to spark anyone's interest. However, when you have that interest, how do you completely screw it up? Easy, cheap film, horrible casting, boring plot, dull dialog, and top it all off with a pathetic ending. Yes cutting into the cake of Blood Widow looks delicious from the outside, but you will find the ingredients to make the cake are not a succulent chocolate base of fluffy goodness, but instead a slimy, dripping pile of complete $#!%. Even the sound department botched up a few areas of the film.

Had this film had some sort of budget, it might have been a lot better with film that makes it feel like you are watching a movie, instead of it looking like it's 1 step up from 8mm footage, and of coarse a decent script with even just a half decent casting director. I'd be willing to wager on this films cast as mostly being people who know each other trying to pass off their school project as a legitimate movie.

Also on the cover it states the movie stars Danielle Lilley. Mmmkay... and she is? Do you know her? I'm certain I don't know her. Her performance in this film sure didn't make me take any notice of her. So that says a lot right there.

The only thing that works for this team is whomever they had Photoshopping the front cover to make it look like it's actually a movie worth watching. Believe me everything about this film was wrong. The lighting, the casting, the producing, the directing... about the only thing I won't say bad about it was the editing of scenes together, at least they did a better job here than whoever edited together the original Debbie Does Dallas. However one of those films you have heard of before, and will always be known, so think about that.

Ok, so what is the plot of this? A young couple buy a house and just happen to find out they live next door to Jason Voorhees who has undergone a sex change. The couple invite their friends over, exchange drugs and hardcore horrible dialog, make some cringe worthy faces that make even 3 year olds think the acting is bad, and then everyone gets picked off one by one.

So... we already know what the film has going for it. A coolish Jason rip-off costume for a woman, who probably would have benefited from making the mask porcelain or something, oh wait, that's already been done, another rip off... oh sorry, I mean ""inspiration"", and the editing doesn't suck as much as everything else about this movie.

Hmmmm.... sure winner here folks, oh yeah, see it, oh yes definitely see it... if you are a student film maker and would like to see an example piece on what not to do with a horror movie. I mean, hey, it's not as bad as ""The Slaughterhouse Massacre"" but it makes ""Nightmare on Elm St 3, 5 & 6"" look like Hollywood holey grails compared to this... heck even Friday the 13th 5, 9 and 10 look like perfect 5/5 movies compared to this one which I wish I could rate -5 out of 5.

Don't be fooled by the cool looking costume on the cover. You don't learn anything about that character other than what you can guess from the title. IF you are desperate to watch a house full of bad actors drinking and taking drugs than being killed in amateur ways, then by all means, check the film out. If not, take my word on it, do some research on other sites besides here on Amazon because of the reviews for this so far, I'm the only one being honest about it.",1403395200,42,4365,4.340686274509804
6308819,5,B00J1Z401K,low budget horror flick just calling it what it is.  however this movie was good and the blood widow rocked.,1403222400,2,108,4.4
6308820,4,B00J1Z401K,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the woodsa new slasher-flick shows up to set you straight!  And what an arrival this film makes!  BLOOD WIDOW is a new entry into this favored horror sub-genre, and it is definitely a title to remember.  Director Jeremiah Buckhalt takes some cues from class slashers of the past, and the result is a horrifying ride into a blood-soaked nightmare!

I wanted to watch this movie the instant I saw the poster; the cold, masked visage of the killer stands out like a lighthouse in the fog, and the image grabs hold of you with a vice-like grip.  A picture like this is definitely a nice draw for a horror flick.

BLOOD WIDOW might be a lower-budget film, but it certainly doesnt feel like one.  It is shot well and looks good onscreen.  I particularly like how the production crew makes the killers basement so foreboding.  This is not an easy task to accomplish, but they pull it off with ease.

The acting is pretty good, about what I was expecting.  No single character steals the show, with the exception of the Blood Widow herself, who is portrayed by Gabrielle Ann Henry.  She does a phenomenal job of creating an icy persona behind which the killer resides.  Her mannerisms are creepy and remind me of Jason in the early FRIDAY THE 13TH films.

The special effects in BLOOD WIDOW are a big winner as well.  Theres a surprising amount of gore, and it is well done.  Theres some nice limb-lopping scenes and even a hefty disembowelment which doesnt leave much to the imagination!  Gore is a definite must-have in a slasher, and this film delivers.

My sole complaint about the film is that some of the characters seem dumber than your average horror-flick cast.  Meaning, they do things that a normal person probably wouldnt do.  I don't want to give examples, because I don't want to give anything in the film away, but if you watch the film you're sure to see what I mean.

Even so, BLOOD WIDOW is a lot of fun and very entertaining.  I would even love to see a sequel to this film; that is saying something because I don't normally look forward to follow-ups.  I highly recommend this film to horror fans.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1402876800,2,2205,4.496221662468514

Blood Widow I feel would have been right in there with those greats.  I think this is a great first run.  While it does have it's rough patches (what film doesn't) it keeps the blood pouring and the blades a swingin'.  It really is a fun movie to watch and the kills get pretty creative.  It'll be interesting to see what they come up with when they have a bigger budget now that they worked some of the kinks out. I would have liked to learn more about who the killer was as a person before dawning the mask.  I know it sounds a bit mean, but I also wanted more people for her to kill.  I also wanted more crossbow, damn it!

I'm not going to give away any spoilers but let's just say that this film has a great take on the whole ""people in the woods, going where they shouldn't go, slashing, blood and guts and chase scenes ensue."" I really loved how the backstory of the Blood Widow was teased out but not thrown in your face, that way it leaves more time for her to do what she does best: Getting rid of annoying neighbors so she can go back to her mentally disturbed solitude. I seriously would love to have her as a member of our HOA!!! No more barking dogs!! LOL!

Many scenes are too dark and it's hard to see what's happening. The killer's costume is well designed though, and the gore is well done (for an amateur production).
