2961097,2,B000W1V4P2,If you like doing the same moves over and over then this is the DVD for you.  I got bored and only did the workout a couple of times.,1229385600,,133,3.586206896551724
2961098,5,B000W1V4P2,"I was already 5 months pregnant when I bought this video and it sat on my desk for another month before I actually used it, so I thought that I may be too out of shape to jump into it. However, it was a pleasant surprise to find that I was able to get through both exercise sections. The DVD is split into two sections, so if you're a beginner you can just start with the first part and then gradually work in the second one. It was difficult enough to work up a sweat, but simple enough that you didn't feel like you were hurting your baby. They also have stretching sections and a section to prepare you for labor. I try to do these everyday as they are pretty short and make you feel really good. I only do the actual exercise portions 3-4 times as week as the video suggests. I also love the fact that the women in the video are actually pregnant including Leisa and they offer slight variations on the exercises depeding on which trimester you are in. Leisa is a good motivator and not cheesy at all. I recommend this for all pregnant women wanting to stay in shape!",1228003200,16,1071,4.203883495145631
2961099,5,B000W1V4P2,"I have the prenatal workout video and absolutely love it.  Leisa makes her workouts very fun and something to look forward to doing 3 to 4 times a week.  I am now on my second pregnancy and am still not tired of the video.  It is very helpful while learning to do the workout, that Leisa moves at a steady pace but still makes it easy to understand.  I can't wait to buy her postnatal pregnancy workout too.",1223424000,5,407,4.17948717948718
2961100,5,B000W1V4P2,"FITMAMA is by far the best pregnancy workout, ever! I have had 4 pregos, and have tried over 15 different pregnancy dvds, and FITMAMA is BY FAR the BEST. Leisa Hart is incredibly easy to follow, motivating, not obnoxious or boring, she is just the best! I love her style, and I LOVE the way she instructs. FITMAMA was fantastic, every soon to be mama should get FIT with FITMAMA!",1222041600,6,379,4.428571428571429
2961101,4,B000W1V4P2,"I have only used the prenatal DVD but like the flexibility of choosing 20 or 40 minute sessions and find that - as someone who is active - this provides a nice complement to my other exercise activities. I also appreciate the attention to movements and breathing that might help with labor.

Leisa's pace and repetition would be fairly comfortable for anyone, at any fitness level, to follow.",1218499200,3,392,4.764705882352941
2961102,5,B000W1V4P2,I have seen a lot of these programs and this is by far the best out there.  I got the 2 DVD pack so it was a great value.  Very happy thanks.,1197590400,7,141,3.375
2961103,4,B000W1V4P2,Though my wife did not like the postnatal ones but she loved doing prenatal ones. Simple yet effective! What can contribute for the extra strength that is required during the D-Day!!,1278892800,,182,4.903225806451613
2961104,2,B000W1V4P2,"This DVD was a little too simple for me. It would be great for a beginner, but not for someone with years of experience doing aerobics.",1272153600,,135,4.230769230769231
2961105,3,B000W1V4P2,The video has a nice pre-labor section and the salsa routine is fun. The yoga though is very repetative and therefore a little boring. The video overall is nice in that it has you doing different variations according to trimesters.,1268265600,,231,4.8
2961106,3,B000W1V4P2,I guess I was expecting something different. More like her going at a speed that I could keep up with!!! This dvd seems like it's for more advanced people not beginners although she does say that it's for anyone...not really!!,1264032000,,226,4.675
2961107,2,B000W1V4P2,"I've ordered this product after reading its enthusiastic reviews.
Must admit I don't share same impression ...
I've only tried the prenatal DVD (both Salsa and Yoga) and
it was nothing but BORING.
Same exercise repeated over and over again through the whole workout.
I've done it once and it was enough ...

Lucky for me I've also ordered the Tracey Mallett's 3 in 1 Pregnancy System
which was GREAT (I've wrote separate review on this one).",1260835200,,441,4.7272727272727275
2961108,1,B000W1V4P2,"When I read the reviews for this product, I figured ""great! a workout for lazy pregnant people!""  Boy was I ever wrong!  This workout actually MAKES YOU FEEL LAZY!  The repitition is rediculous!  I couldn't even get through the salsa portion without wondering ""is she ever gonna switch to another maneuver?!""  If you want a good workout, this isn't for you.  If you feel lazy while pregnant (as I do) and just want something to make you move...this isn't for you either.  In fact, I would recommend the Prenatal Pilates workout instead.  I don't have a recommendation for a really good workout because I'm too lazy to do one. :)",1260489600,,628,4.6454545454545455
2961109,1,B000W1V4P2,"I was 5 months pregnant when I purchased this DVD set. I was very disappointed after doing the YOGA portion of the prenatal DVD. Leisa goes through the same 3 sets of moves over and over again. I got so frustrated that I just sat down for the last 5 minutes of the routine. Before I got pregnant, I was regularly working out with TurboJam, HipHopAbs and Rockin' Body, whereas the routines are proven, original, non redundant and fun. This Fit Mama DVD set just feel like Leisa Hart took an after-noon to shot the entire DVD, and did not putting any effort into coming up with more than a few moves to fill up her routine. Cheap.",1249430400,,628,4.330508474576271
2961110,2,B000W1V4P2,"I thought this workout video was completely lame. I'm holding out hope that the postnatal is better than the prenatal. I'll find out in a couple of months. There was absolutely nothing challenging about it. Especially the yoga fat burn. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to lose weight, but I am trying to stay fit. Doing the same sequence of poses 6 TIMES and moving on to a stretching section is not my idea of a workout. BOR-ING! The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star is becasue of the opening dance/cardio section. Cheesy, but effective in getting your heart rate up. This video needs variety - big time.

If you want a real ""workout"" get The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1. If you want real yoga, get Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea.",1244073600,5,754,4.424460431654676
2961111,5,B000W1V4P2,"I tried this DVD for the first time about an hour ago.  I'm four months pregnant with my first baby.  I didn't really exercise a whole lot before becoming pregnant but I wasn't overweight or extremely out of shape, either.  I just tried the salsa dance and it was really fun!  I worked up a light sweat and we'll see tomorrow whether I feel it in any of my muscles.  I haven't tried any other pregnancy fitness dvds and I probably won't because I'm so pleased with this one.  And it's a great price because you get the post-natal workout as well.  What I really like about this one is that even if you don't have the energy to do the workouts, you can still do the stretching segment.  I would definitely recommend this to any of my pregnant friends.",1243296000,,750,4.307142857142857
2961112,5,B000W1V4P2,"I only got an opportunity to do this DVD a couple of times due to being put on strict bedrest. The times I did get to use it were great. I was actually sore after doing it, which I really didn't expect. I think this DVD would be great for any mom to be wanting to stay active during pregnancy. The workouts are pretty low impact, but they do get the job done. I wish I was able to continue to do it! I would strongly recommend talking to your doc before any exercise, even this low impact DVD.",1243123200,,493,3.98989898989899
2961113,2,B000W1V4P2,"I have tried several pregnancy DVDs, and this one is the worst.  This is terribly repetitive and boring.  She repeats the same couple of moves for 30 minutes.  I get too bored with that.  Too much talking and not enough working out.  I didn't think it was that great.",1242864000,,267,4.36734693877551
2961114,4,B000W1V4P2,"I like this workout a lot.  I was not much of an exerciser prior to my pregnancy, so this was a workout that pushed me just enough, was easy enough that my increasingly clumsy self didn't trip over my own feet, and it wasn't silly or stupid like some workout videos.  I haven't tried the postnatal yet as I am due in a couple of months, but if it's half as good as the prenatal one, I will use it, too.",1242604800,,402,3.950617283950617
2961115,5,B000W1V4P2,"I really enjoy this pregnancy workout!  I was looking for something that would make me feel like I was keeping in shape while pregnant with my 5th child and this fit the bill. Having had a miscarriage a couple months prior to this pregnancy while I was still doing my regular non pregnancy workout, I was a bit paranoid and wanted something that I was sure would be SAFE for pregnancy.  I am happy with this. The workout is fun, the moves are simple and Leisa Hart explains them well. I love the Salsa dancing and that the yoga part is not all mystical and weird.  The yoga section seems low key but I can actually feel it the next day so I know I've gotten a good workout. I've never been into aerobics, but this one is perfect.  I rotate it with Denise Austin's Fit and Firm pregnancy DVD just to do something different each day and keep it varied. I choose to work out about 6 days a week, rather than the recommended 3 or 4. Comparing to Denise Austin, Leisa Hart is very pleasant to listen to and upbeat without being annoying in any way.  She is encouraging and helpful and I would recommend this DVD to any pregnant Mommy!",1242518400,,1129,4.28169014084507

I ordered it with ""same day shipping"" since it was shown as being in-stock at Amazon and I really wanted to do it right away.  Amazon, however, chose to not even ship my item until about five days later.  Great workout, but _never_ waste your money ordering same-day shipping from Amazon; they won't ship same day.  It is a ripoff.",1240876800,,548,4.43
2961117,1,B000W1V4P2,"This workout was as I said just glorified walking, I actually think that if I went on a walk that I would get a better workout.

At 20 weeks, I started rotating this and Denise Austin's Fit and Firm Pregnancy (also excellent) for a total of 3 workouts a week. I am now at 32 weeks and can still do the videos, even though I'm slowing down a bit! I'm still enjoying it, and that's saying a lot because I get bored pretty easy. I highly recommend this video.",1236902400,2,419,4.0602409638554215
2961120,5,B000W1V4P2,"I've never been much of a video workout person, but this one I actually enjoyed and looked forward to doing! If you are really fit this video is probably not for you, but if like me your pre-pregnancy work out consisted of mostly walking or light cardio you should find this just right. I got this video in my first trimester and found it a little easy at that time as I was not really showing yet. In my second trimester it was just right using the second trimester variations Lisa provides. My heart rate was up and I was breathing hard, but the workout lasted  just long enough that I didn't get too overheated. Then the last portion of the video is great for relaxing and stretching those sore muscles. The leg stretch for a pinched sciatic nerve came in very handy when I was awakened at night with sciatic pain. I am now in the later portion of my last trimester and do not use the work out portion of the video as often as I should, but still love the stretching and delivery portion.",1232236800,,991,4.2994652406417115
2961121,5,B000W1V4P2,"I really like the prenatal workout in this package.  I haven't tried the postnatal workout yet.  The prenatal workout is just challenging enough and offers some modifications depending on which trimester you are in.  The salsa dancing is a good way to make the cardio component enjoyable.  The yoga portion is a nice way to stretch out the muscles that need it most.  You have the option of doing a long workout for more ""advanced"" exercisers or a short workout for ""beginner"" exercisers.  I bought a few prenatal workout videos and this is my favorite.  I am more of a beginner at this point because I had been on bed rest and I am perfectly able to do the workout.",1231632000,2,666,4.5

If you are really fit this video is probably not for you, but if like me your pre-pregnancy work out consisted of mostly walking or light cardio you should find this just right. I got this video in my first trimester and found it a little easy at that time as I was not really showing yet. In my second trimester it was just right using the second trimester variations Lisa provides. My heart rate was up and I was breathing hard, but the workout lasted  just long enough that I didn't get too overheated. Then the last portion of the video is great for relaxing and stretching those sore muscles. The leg stretch for a pinched sciatic nerve came in very handy when I was awakened at night with sciatic pain. I am now in the later portion of my last trimester and do not use the work out portion of the video as often as I should, but still love the stretching and delivery portion.",1232236800,,991,4.2994652406417115
3195618,5,B000W1V4P2,"I really like the prenatal workout in this package.  I haven't tried the postnatal workout yet.  The prenatal workout is just challenging enough and offers some modifications depending on which trimester you are in.  The salsa dancing is a good way to make the cardio component enjoyable.  The yoga portion is a nice way to stretch out the muscles that need it most.  You have the option of doing a long workout for more ""advanced"" exercisers or a short workout for ""beginner"" exercisers.  I bought a few prenatal workout videos and this is my favorite.  I am more of a beginner at this point because I had been on bed rest and I am perfectly able to do the workout.",1231632000,2,666,4.5
3195619,5,B000W1V4P2,"I have only done 3 of the 4 sections so far - the yoga, the stretching and labor and delivery section... but I have really enjoyed them.  It was easy to follow and feels like a great workout!",1229731200,2,191,4.026315789473684

8220985,3,B000W1V4P2,This DVD is not very challenging and kind of boring. It is salsa and not salza - I thought it would be more of a workout and disappointed . It is also rather old and outdated.,1413936000,,175,3.888888888888889
8220986,5,B000W1V4P2,Super fun video! I did this video with a few of my pregnacies and I really enjoyed it!,1407974400,,86,3.8333333333333335

8220988,5,B000W1V4P2,I didn't get started soon enough into my pregnancy to really get alot out of the prenatal workout but what I did was good for where I was in my pregnancy (8 months). I have just started the postnatal workout due to the fact that I had a c-section I waited till my baby girl was 6 weeks old. So far I have just concentrated on the workouts with baby and my baby absolutely LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I did howver have to modify the workouts a bit because the babies used in the dvd are atleast 4 months old so I had to protect my babies head a bit more than they did. Just getting started on this but so far I'm very excited about this dvd. I had it given to me as a gift and now plan to buy it for another friend who is due soon so she can enjoy the baby & me workout too!!!!!,1329955200,,776,3.9177215189873418
8220989,3,B000W1V4P2,"I find the host rather annoying, but that's true for most workout videos.  Setting that aside, the routines are quite repetitive, which is fine for a beginner but would probably be boring for someone looking for a more intense workout.

I do like that there are two routines to choose from -- the salsa dance routine and the yoga routine (which is actually a decent workout compared to some other yoga dvds), so I can decide based on my mood which I'd rather do. I haven't gotten to the post-natal workout point yet, so I can't comment on that part of the set.",1319328000,,560,4.427184466019417
8220990,5,B000W1V4P2,"This video worked great for me during my pregnancy even though I didn't get a whole lot of use out of it.  I was high risk, so I was not allowed to use it during my first trimester.  Then, preterm contractions at 26 weeks put me on bedrest.  But the few weeks I did get to use it, it was a lot of fun.  I have yet to do the post-natal work out.  My son was colicky from birth and is very active now, so I hadn't even pulled it out.  I wonder if you can do the exercises with a toddler...",1317254400,,487,3.7254901960784315
8220991,5,B000W1V4P2,"I did the prenatal workouts religiously and felt great physically during my pregnancy. My weight gain was perfect, and I felt energized. I felt that they were extremely helpful. I had done a few other prenatal workouts that were too intense for me, but these ones were perfect. I only did the post-natal workouts a few times, as once I was able to exercise again, I went for something a little more vigorous. I didn't feel like the post-natal workouts were challenging enough for what I was going for, but they are a good start for just starting to exercise again. The baby and mommy workout is really fun with your new baby, as well.",1293926400,,634,4.521739130434782

Will definitaley order from this place again! although i could not muster up the energy to really do these consitently pregnant but that my fault not the videos it was easy to follow along to being pregannt still i am just lazy,1293321600,,311,4.473684210526316
8220993,3,B000W1V4P2,"Although it is a great DVD, it is not for me. This is made for a beginner to exercise, and someone who enjoys dancing. I did a lot of strenuous activity before I was pregnant and I felt that this dvd was way too mellow for me. The yoga in the prenatal workout was the best part, but was focused on leg work. The postnatal workout was much better, but again with the dancing. Not my favorite.",1281312000,,391,4.090909090909091
