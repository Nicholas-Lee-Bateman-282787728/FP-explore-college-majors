6476051,4,B00L8YJIDW,"I liked Step Up, All In, it's better than the last movie. Like many Step Up movies, it's combined many Step Up cast members throughout the series together. The only difference is, it does it MORE THAN usual. They bring in so many people, you will be shocked to see so many of them, and by the end, it's really hard to put them, ""ALL IN"", the last performance. lol

This is the first time, where you see two previous main stars put in together for a new love interest. They both are somehow over their past loves and somewhat ready for a new love. Will they fall in love? Yes. Will it be easy? HELL NO! This is a movie, so we need to see them fall first before they FLY! It literally looks like that at the end. They will do an amazing move that has never been done...at least in a Step Up movie.

The character Moose has come back yet again. He is one of the most recognized characters in all Step Up movies because he has been in 4 out of 5 movies. He brings yet again, his amazing dance skills and is in almost all the main performances. His character this time is  more heavily involved in the story line, so expect to see him a lot more than the last.

When I said they brought back lot of people in this movie, I should also mention, they did this because they will battle each other. It will be Step Up All Stars vs The Mob! It's very interest how they made this story line work out throughout the movie. In the end, they will bring it all together to see one amazing performance.

I should also mention that the performances seemed to get better and better as the movie goes on. I think they did this because they wanted to showcase the last performance, on how great it will be. So, the beginning ones were just okay and by the end of it, you will love the last one.

I definitely recommend this movie and is a must watch. Also, worth watching more than once to really experience on how awesome they made this movie.",1407801600,21,1924,4.158602150537634

6476057,5,B00L8YJIDW,I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I like the Step Up movies. But this one is one of my favorites in the series. Movies set in Vegas are usually fun and this delivers om that level. If you watch closely some moves are repeated a little too often in my opinion but it's still cool to watch. Acting isn't as corny as you might expect. And Andie... whew. She's looking as good as ever in this ine.,1502668800,,398,4.115384615384615

6476150,5,B00L8YJIDW,"So...VH1 is having a dance contest. Does it make more sense for the guy who was abandoned by his crew to tell THEM he wants to enter-they're on the other side of the country now...or for the crew to tell that ONE person-who they knew stayed behind to keep pursuing his dream-to tell him they're entering/ask him to join them? Yeah, that's what I thought. Seriously, why is the Mob pissed at Sean? They made the decision to go back to Miami without talking to him about it. THEY entered the contest without telling HIM & they knew perfectly well he was still dancing. Annoys me every time I watch it. Also, I don't think Sean would try to pull Andie into a trick they haven't even rehearsed during the competition. That said, I love this movie-my favorite from the series besides the original. The focus is mostly on the dancing and that's what I came for. The final contest is amazingly choreographed and I dig the steampunk-y outfits. And the scene on the tilt-a-whirl (or whatever) is adorable. I don't think I'd heard ""every little step"" since high school lol. I rate dance movies based on how much they make me miss dancing & how much they make me want to get up & dance right now. There are probably only 30 min of non dancing scenes in the whole movie-which is awesome. Based on those 3 things, I absolutely give this a five.",1438473600,,1331,4.436734693877551

I would only say, I found it quite awkward that the competitors dances are FAR BETTER than the protagonist teams' dances. I'm not sure why we, as viewers would prefer the protagonist over the competition. They were clearly so much better, impactful, interesting. Somebody might enlighten me. Anyway, the movie is cool, though I haven't seen the others. Worth buying for this price if you like this genre. You may watch it more than once.",1438041600,,600,4.669811320754717

6476225,2,B00L8YJIDW,"This movie is BAD, and not in a good way.  The dancing is horrible, messy, poorly choreographed and a really unfortunate use of some good quality performers.  It's all gimmicks and gloss and doesn't give the dance crews a chance to really show their merits.  Truly disappointing.  (I say this as someone who's danced for over 30 years and I live for dance movies, even the ones that don't usually get good reviews ).  I guess if you don't dance, or if you're a fan of the folks in the movie, maybe this is fun to watch.  Otherwise, it's pretty painful.  Even without the ""dancing"", the story is boring and the acting sub par (and way too much time dedicated to the ""plot"").  It just didn't cut it for me.  I kept watching hoping it would turn into something but all I wanted by the end was my 112 minutes back. :-(",1422489600,,814,4.302631578947368

6476230,4,B00L8YJIDW,"I rate this movie 3.5, maybe 4, out of 5 stars, but I'm a humongous fan of this franchise, so probably I'm under the influence of bias. It's one of my guilty pleasures and, with eyes wide open, I accept the trade-off, having to slog thru crap scenes rife with bad acting and recycled dialogue just to get to those electrifying dance sequences. How has Step Up put out four sequels? It's the dancing, yo. And, sure, maybe a bit of Channing Tatum.

Step Up All In is the fifth one. Like others have mentioned already, it raids the rosters of previous Step Up films. It picks up sixth months after its immediate predecessor, Step Up: Revolution, and finds the Miami Mob without a cause and in Los Angeles, unsuccessfully auditioning for gig after gig. Having lost the confidence of his crew, Sean Asa (Ryan Guzman) keeps on keeping on even when the others give up and jet. And then came that announcement of a reality TV dance crew competition in Vegas, the prize being a three-year booking contract.

My fave dude in this series is Moose Alexander (Adam Sevani) who is the franchise linchpin, having been in four of the five films. Awesomely, he figures in the plot as much as he did in Step Up 3-D. Moose is now an engineer but one senses it won't take too much to get him back to hoofing. Also back is Alison Stoner (she's been in three of these) who plays his girlfriend and whom you may remember being featured in those Missy Elliot music videos when she was a pony-tailed kid. Moose plays a key role in helping Sean assemble a new crew that actually is an amalgamation of the crews from Step Up 2 The Streets and Step Up 3-D, plus some fresh new characters (the dance instructor who works at Moose's grandparents' dance studio is a hoot, man!).

Sean and Moose's first recruit is Andie (Briana Evigan) from Step Up 2: The Streets, and it's obvious from jump that the instantly combative Sean and Andie - whose respective ex-significant others are conveniently out of the picture - will inform the film's primary romantic content. No worries, they aren't the modern-day Romeo and Juliet. We can all focus on the dancing.

I think I'll stick with 3.5 out of 5 stars. There's huge fun in watching the group dynamics among familiar characters, familiar to us but some of them meet for the first time here. Is it worth mentioning that Izabella Miko as the veejay generates a few laughs but that she's generally annoying? Adam Sevani as Moose is still the most likable of the bunch, and I like that he has a meatier role and lands his own story conflict to work out. For those who care, the film does a great job of integrating the 3D moments. And what about the dancing? Well, not only does the storyline lack the zip of Step Up: Revolution, with that 4th film's funky outlaw protest theme, a lot of the dance sequences don't seem as fresh or original. Yes, they're dynamic stuff, but we see the same moves over and over. Still, several routines elevate themselves: the all-hands-on-deck finale with that stupefying finishing move, LMNTRIX's Frankenstein's laboratory audition, and, best of all, Sean and Andie's grooving to Bobby Brown's ""Every Little Step"" on a carnival ride. It's such a giddy, honest, unpretentious expression of joy and the love of dance. It makes up for any flaw in the movie.",1421625600,4,3297,4.592529711375212

It doesn't deliver on the script, the plot, or the acting (especially not Isabella Miko - yeesh!), but it does deliver on the action, which is the dancing.  That's what you watch these movies to see.  I will fast forward through the regular scenes to get to the dance battles because they are so worth watching.  As far as dancing, this movie is in my top 3 finales (my order is 2, 3, 5, 4, and then 1), but it has my favorite single dance battle, which is the scene in the boxing ring.  As long as you don't expect Shakespearean tragedy and know you're getting an action film, you'll enjoy it.",1418428800,,707,4.358778625954199

6476272,2,B00L8YJIDW,"This movie compared to the previous ones was lackluster at best.  What I loved best about the other movies were the amazing choreography and the long dance sequences that were shown in their entirety.  This movie seemed to only show small excerpts of dance sequences other than the last battle scene.  Also I felt the background of the new characters in this movie was not displayed in enough detail to create a connection with the audience.  The lead male character's (Ryan Guzman) motivation was very obscure and lacked any background or history.  The acting left a lot to be desired as well.  It was also never explained how Andie (the female lead) ended in LA and single.
All in all I felt the movie was lacking in a cohesive and believable story line with less emphasis on the dancing than the previous movies.  I also felt the choreography was tired and repetitive.  With so many amazing dance shows on TV like ""So You Think You Can Dance"" from which some of the dancers in this movie were picked from, give audiences an elevated and educated understanding of choreography, and the choreography in this movie falls far short of that.
I think the Step Up movies need to do just that... Step it up.",1417737600,,1202,4.610328638497653

6476285,1,B00L8YJIDW,Poor plot development.  Chemistry between  leads was lacking.  Wanted more Moose back story.  Thought the previous step up movie had better  and more innovative dance moves.  Least favorite of series.,1417219200,,200,5.5
6476286,3,B00L8YJIDW,"I've always liked the Step Up movies for their entertainment. I've never held them to be some sort of deep and profound series and I've always thought the MCs could use a little script work. But I'd still put them at 4-5 stars because of the great choreography and entertainment value (just compare to many other dance movies and you can see that these go above and beyond many of them -- except maybe Center Stage 1.

I loved Guzman in Step Up 4 and thought he held some of the weaker casting up (e.g., Kathryn McCormick)

Step Up All In just didn't do it for me. Even Guzman's screen time couldn't make up for what everything else lacked. The choreography was a lot of obvious repeated moves. Because they combined cast from all of the movies, and each character has their own area of dance, this style repeat is expected. But it wasn't just the style. Every routine in this movie was the same and there wasn't much of a wow factor. Even the last routine -- while the fire was cool and the variety of dance was stepped up (heh) -- it was not as exciting as the other final dance sequences.

There were too many cliche step up scenes too. While I don't mind cliches in these types of movies, it just didn't work with this one. Just as the style was a bit...dull...there weren't any new lines in the cliche scenes so there was no differentiating factor to this movie:
- boy meets girl --> dance battle pursues
- boy likes girl but girl struggles with fact --> cue high school-esque scene where the girl sits down all mopy and cries to her girlfriend ""I just don't know what to do, I think he likes me. What should I do?"" --- I thought they were all supposed to be mid-twenties here?? come on, now. This scene really killed it for me.
- A few too many ""epic inspirational talks"" --> everytime there is a disagreement no matter how small or big, expect glazed eyes and ""we are here for our passion!"" ""It's not about the money"" ""We love to dance and that's all that matters!"" ""Come on guys, let's show them what we love to do!""

I didn't hate the movie. It just wasn't my favorite and I had higher expectations considering this was more of a reunion casting.",1417132800,7,2155,4.3399503722084365

6476300,2,B00L8YJIDW,"I remember the first movie of this kind that I saw (""You Got Served"") which literally had me banging my head against the wall at how cliched it was.  This one ranks right up there with that one.  A convoluted plot, practically stick-figure characters, and way too many subplots, this took all my inner strength to finish.

For the life of me, I will never understand why these movies want to weigh everyone down with so much unnecessary drama.  This is supposed to be a movie about dance, so dance and shut up the whining.  When the film sticks to the dancing, it is fun to watch.  Be it rehearsals or the club battles at ""The Vortex,"" I enjoyed that.  I also recognized many dancers from ""So You Think You Can Dance.""

I could get over the least coherent, most easily remedied but neglected story of all time, except that the dance scenes, the entire point of this series, are barely appreciable: They're all completely contrived, as if this is a music video, and none of the camerawork accentuates any of the difficulty or spectacle.

The last 2 Step Up movies were incredible in 3D and I was really looking forward to this one. Lionsgate was including 3D versions on ALL copies of their movies, instead of releasing separate 3D and 2D-only discs like other studios, so this is very disheartening.

Thankfully this IS being released in 3D overseas (from Universal apparently) and I have a region-free player, so I will be ordering that to show my continuing support for 3D. Sorry that Lionsgate doesn't want my money this time. Along with Disney, they've just dealt a major blow to the format here in the US.",1411516800,20,694,4.688524590163935

I have a region-free 3D Blu ray player, so I will order it from the U.K.--but this (and others 3D movies like ""Noah"", Maleficent"", ""Need for Speed"") are American-made movies--why do I have to order it from overseas?

6476330,4,B00L8YJIDW,"What's good: the dance. I'm not much of a dance person, but that level of athletics, dance or whatever you want to call it, simply floors me. Men and women both, they put on displays of grace and power that simply have to be seen. The women - they aren't scrawny little things, they're built solid to hard work, and it looks great on them. And that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Effie/dp/B008602KQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Effie</a>-esque announcer was kind of a hoot.

What's meh: plot. Just enough to keep things moving, I never really got inspired by the motivation. Or characters.

What needs work: Would a tightly choreographed dance really work if one (or more) of the stars dropped out the day before show time? I would naively have guessed that the gap left in the lineup would be pretty hard to work around, or to patch at the last minute. Then there's that stagecraft: lights, elaborate sets, costumes, and the rest - cripes, I'd figure months to engineer it all and days or weeks to execute. And, don't you think the judges would notice if two of the  stars stopped to talk about their next move in the middle of the show?

But this is a feel-good flick, full of inspiration (I guess) and fantastic moves. Take it for what it is, don't think too hard, and you'll have a fantastic experience.

The set up that leads the crew to go home wasn't believable per se, but again, it set the stage.
