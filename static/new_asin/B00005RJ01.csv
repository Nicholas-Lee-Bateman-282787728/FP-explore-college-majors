1655613,5,B00005RJ01,"Cooler's Revenge AKA The Best of the Strongest vs Strongest this is a great movie I've only seen it in Jap so far but I think that Funimation will do a good job. I really wish that Pionneer would do all the movies so it will be like watching it in Jap with all the cursing and swearing but they would be talking in English. I just bought movies 1 and 2 (Dead Zone, and Worlds Strongest) Uncut and Pionneer did the dubbing and they had all the swearing and on Dead Zone it had a cut beggining it was really cool. This movie will well worth your money the fight scenes are great and it has probabbly the best Movie Plot. If you haven't pre ordered it yet DO IT after you read this review it is one of the great DBZ Movies.",1004832000,3,720,4.006944444444445

The fight with Cooler is not as long as his brother's, but it does have some very dramatic scenes.  Goku and Vegeta fight together to destroy the brother of the madman who was responsible for the destruction of their entire race!  Fight scenes are above-average quality.

Great action, awesome fight scenes and the music!! Awesome soundtrack picked for this one, I loved Breaking Point's ""Falling Down"" playing when Piccolo rescues Gohan and goes up against Cooler's goonies!! The American soundtrack is the main I bought this version instead of the movie pack (wasn't sure if it had the U.S. or the Japanese soundtrack), the songs by Disturbed, Dust for Life, Deftones, Breaking Point, and Finger Eleven just made the movie more badass. Once this movie's over you'll want to watch it again.",1391126400,2,687,4.59349593495935
1655621,5,B00005RJ01,"This DVD contains Dragon Ball Z Movie 5: ""The Incredible Strongest vs Strongest"" or simply ""Cooler's Revenge.

The plot of the movie is simple.  Cooler (Coola) is the brother of DBZ series villain Freeza.  After hearing about his death at the hand of a Saiyan he sets out to Earth to avenge his brother's death and to restore honor to his family.  Spoiler Alert: He doesn't have such a great time when he gets there.

The video quality is standard.  In it's original 4:3 aspect ratio and everything.

the english dub audio uses a replacement musical score so dub fans who want the original music will be missing out.  Otherwise the quality is good in 5.1 surround sound.  The original Japanese mono track is about as good as any other JP tracks given to Funimation by Toei.

Also features a great translation by Steve Simmons.

One surprise that greeted me when I got this DVD was that it contained a Spanish audio track and an english translation of said audio track.  Having often heard of how highly regarded the Spanish dub of the series is held I was curious and checked it out.  While the translation was a little wonky it was a great experience and I wish this dub would be included on more Funimation releases.

All in all, until Funimation releases Dragon Box versions of the movies this is the best version of the movie you can pick up in North America.",1377129600,3,1363,4.532786885245901

1655623,5,B00005RJ01,"There was only one word to describe this movie, Finally! we finally have that great DBZ movie good animation as well as an awesome kick-ass soundtrack and strong story. this time around it's your classic revenge story as Goku defeated Frieza now Frieza's brother cooler has taken notice of Goku and goes to Earth to make Goku suffer. so essentially in cooler's eyes ""you take something from me, i take everything from you"". now the reason the story is strong isn't because of the revenge factor because thats kinda of cliche but the obvious inclusion of Frieza's brother who is an iconic DBZ villain and his brother is even stronger. next would be the quality of animation, the animation quality was fairly good but it wasn't the best. even so it was better than previous DBZ movies and three scenes in particular that were far above average in animation quality and that was 1st: Goku's first Kamehameha attempt on cooler. 2nd: when Goku transforms into a super saiyan. 3rd: coolers death ball at the end. and the best thing in my opinion similar to ""Lord Slug"" was the heavy use of ballads and Rock n roll that fits Dragon Ball Z perfect. now the last thin i appreciate is disabling Goku to further strengthen the rolls of other characters. My favorite DBZ movie to date leaves awarding this (Legendary) and a personal favorites ribbon.",1371427200,,1338,4.722222222222222

That's true, but the music only matches the language that you're hearing, so no English dialogue with Japanese music option!  It's not bad for the series, but for the movie they place these annoying songs in it & it's like watching something while the radio's on!

He's stronger than Frieza and he's pissed at Goku for shaming his family's reputation. As if being an evil tyrant didn't give him a bad enough name. He arrives on Earth with his henchmen and seeks out Goku. An epic battle takes place. This time it doesn't take 30 episode to finish. This is one of my favorite DBZ movies. Cooler is a ""cooler"" character than Frieza and he's got the power to really challenge a Super Saiyan. The battle is awesome, even though it's short.

1655634,3,B00005RJ01,"Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge is the fifth movie in the DBZ movie series and a pretty good watch. The movie itself revolves around the hero Goku and a previous battle he fought against the mighty alien, Frieza.  Cooler, Frieza's older brother hears of Frieza's defeat and seeks Goku to get revenge, not for Frieza's sake, but for sake of the family name. Pretty common elements from the Dragon Ball Z series are here.  Some comic relief moments, an invincible villain and his minions, and Goku finding the strength to beat his opponent.  Kind of like putting Frieza saga in movie form.  Only issues I have with the film is it is so short! It feels like maybe there should have been more to the ending, but that's typically how the DBZ movies end.

Most of my irks were in the english version, as it uses a lot of hit music for the film.  Bands like Drowning Pool, American Pearl, Breaking Point, etc, which I have nothing against, but at parts where the characters are talking and the song vocals in the background begin making it hard to understand the characters.  Not a big deal, but I am just a fan of the japanese versions for that reason.  If you're a DBZ fan, I'm sure you've watched it and if not, it'd be good to catch this DBZ action.",1288742400,,1246,4.4104803493449785

1655637,5,B00005RJ01,"Frieza, in all his foolishness, let the young Goku escape in a Saiyan spacepod during his battle with Bardock. Looking from afar was his brother, Cooler, who let the Saiyan child live stating that he would be Frieza's eventual downfall. He couldn't have been more correct...

Now that the tyrant Frieza has finally fallen, Cooler has arrived on Earth looking for Goku in order to seek revenge. Goku is not able to stand up to Cooler's initial assault, so now it's up to Gohan and all his friends to protect him until he can recover and summon the Super Saiyan strength he needs to finally defeat Cooler.

I thought this was a great Dragonball Z movie, and one of the best ones overall. Goku is injured early on in the film, which takes much of the focus off of him and places it instead on his son, Gohan, and his comrades. This gives the story an opportunity to make use of the supporting cast to a much greater extent, allowing them to become much more than just weaklings that get tossed aside in the early stages of a fight. There is also much more depth to Cooler's character than there is to the villains that came before him in previous movies. An example of this is illustrated in a scene where he admits he doesn't care much for Frieza and that he deserved what he got, but still has an obligation to try and avenge his death. The FUNimation dub is done more decently this time around than it was in Lord Slug, though the soundtrack still needs work and the French accent portrayed by Sauzer's character is quite exaggerated and over the top.

If you're a Dragonball Z fan at all, then you should buy/watch this movie. Keep in mind when viewing it though, that it does conflict with what happens in the series. For example, Goku should not be on Earth until Trunks arrives and kills Frieza and King Cold, so it's not possible that he would be waiting there when Cooler shows up. Aside from continuity issues, it's a great standalone movie and shouldn't be missed!",1184716800,7,1972,4.487465181058496
1655638,5,B00005RJ01,"Cooler's revenge rocks! its a a*s kicking movie! I love all the metal music that funimation uses. Plus it includes two of my favorite bands of all time--Drowning Pool and disturbed. The music really blends well with all the action. I sing along to all the DP music and Dis music thats in the movie. The reason why i love this movie is that: 1. The cool battle sequences 2. The rockin heavy metal music (sorry japanese DBZ fans, but the music in the english version is much better that the suckish crappy used up dragonball music in the original--i like the japanese version but the music in it is Blah! really bad) Funimation did a great job dubbing this film--hey i do like the dubbed version of the series (at least Funimation is better than 4kids who destroy every good anime they get their hands on--One Peice, Shaman King, and Tokyo Mew Mew.)So this movie is your basic DBZ formula: a new threat comes to invade earth (cooler and his henchmen)-lots of action-and the final fight and goku saves everyone-again! go out and buy this movie, it ROCKS!",1126483200,,1051,4.5661375661375665
1655639,4,B00005RJ01,This is how it started out Goku and the gang were out in the woods camping until they were interupted by some evil aliens their head leader is Cooler the brother of Frezia he came for revenge on the one who killed his brother Cooler is stronger then his brother but in the end Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan and defeated Cooler. I'm giving it four stars cause the fight scenes were a bit slow they were not moving very fast I was disapointed cause thats what DBZ is all about.,1120089600,,481,4.239130434782608
1655640,4,B00005RJ01,"A well-done DBZ movie has cool moments, major power conflicts, a neat main villain, and beats on the main characters a lot. This one delivers. Cooler, brother to psychotic supervillain Freezer (yes, all of Toriyama-sensei's names are like that) comes to challenge the upstart ""monkey"" (as his people call Saiyajin) who defeated his little brother.
  Cooler is, well, cooler than his brother was. He sounds the same and looks quite similar, but he's MUCH tougher and meaner. He saw Goku's capsule escape the destruction of Vegita-sei at Freezer's hands years ago, but didn't intercept, saying it was Freezer's own problem. Cooler clearly outmatches Goku on every level, but won't kill him immediately because he knows that what he's seeing isn't what could defeat his brother. He insists on seeing the Super-Saiyajin transformation, and will push Goku until he gets it. Which, of course, he does.
  This makes an excellent double-bill with ""Return of Cooler"" (Japanese title translates more to ""Attack of a Billion Power Warriors"" or something of that nature), where Cooler gets a return match.",1066089600,,1093,5.193181818181818
1655641,4,B00005RJ01,"This was the first DBZ movie I ever saw.  And coming off of the TV anime which was way too drawn out (at least until the Cell Games) this short 45 minute movie was graetly appreciated.  It starts off with an explaination of who this Cooler guy is and how he ties into the series (even though he's exclusive to the movies).  He is the elder brother of Freiza (yes, that will he just dia and go away? Freiza) and is much stronger than his little bro.  He comes to earth to maintain his family's honor (not to avenge his brother) which is a very Japanese concept I guess.  The fight really starts off about halfway through the movie and keeps heating up til the very end, especially once Coller powers up to a level surpasing his brother's (heh heh heh).  I watched the movie in Japanese and English.  I do like the Japanese voices better, but the music is all recycled from the series.  The English voices are ok, but the rock music really makes the fights feel more intense.  This is the 5th of 13 DBZ movies.  FUNimation really needs to get crackin on the rest of the movies (they've released the first 8 so far).  Also, the reason that the highest mark I can give to a DBZ movie is 4 stars is that none of them are widescreen in the US releases.  These were released in the theaters in Japan, thus they ARE supposed to be widescreen (matted format 1.85:1 ratio I believe, TV screens are 1.33:1).  There are scenes in the movies that look chopped off at the sides on the DVDs.  This is why.  All in all, it's a good bye for a DVD fan.  If you're not, but like a good quick fight anime, rent it at least.",1061510400,,1603,4.20655737704918
1655642,4,B00005RJ01,"well there is always a lot of surprises in the DBZ series and movies. just when you think that all of Freeza's family is dead, here comes his brother. certainly we all know what happens, he comes they fight, and boom: the good guys win. if you're not a DBZ fan id recomend you watch the series before you pick up any of the movies or specials. most people hate these series because they don't know the story behind them, and the movies just take place at certain time periods of the series. over all this is a great anime for those that like DBZ. its #4 of 12 i think and would be a great addition to fans who collect them.",1038441600,,623,4.114754098360656
1655643,2,B00005RJ01,"I don't believe Dragonball Z is very well suited to the limited running time of movies. DBZ is much better suited to the series where it has more time to develop the characters and create tension.
  This movie seemed even more predictable than the other ones, but I think the main problem was the short length of the battles especially the one with Gohan on his way to deliver the Sensu beans and the final fight. Granted given the characters it makes sense that the battles weren't allowed to go on longer, but there wasn't enough tension built up throughout the movie.
  Concerning the soundtrack, how lame. The only time  the heavey metal or whatever ... it is worked was with the History of Trunks, the other times it's just been stupid.
  All that being said I don't even think I would consider an essential viewing for a DBZ fan like most of the other movies I would.",1031011200,,873,4.487341772151899

Then he is going camping which is ruined by Cooler, who is Frieza's brother. Goku and everyone has to fight him and his goons. But I better stop talking or I might just ruin the Movie. The Music was cool too, I would give it a 8 out of 10. The fight scenes were cool also. This movie really gets you into it. It has action,humor, and cool music.

They used music that fit with the fight scenes and the voice overs and matching the taling to the mouth movements were great. The plot was good and I realize that it was different somewhat of the orginal japanese version. usually FUNimation (after they moved productions after the Namek Saga, when they got new voices) did a horrible job at making the show interesting but they really did a great job on this one.",1025654400,,559,4.714285714285714
1655646,4,B00005RJ01,"Originally entitled ""Battle of the Strongest vs. the Strongest"", ""Cooler's Revenge"" is a feature which takes place in a seperate continuity from the main DBZ storyline.  At the outset of this story the primary antagonist, Cooler, is witnessing his brother Frieza demolishing the planet Vegeta (Bardock, the Father of Goku).  After being completely disgusted with his brother's baseless arrogance, Cooler's henchmen detect a Saiyan space pod being launched from Vegeta.  Cooler dismisses this as his brother's problem (which it will be) and not his (which it will be).  This, of course, is the pod containing baby Kakorrot, known on the Earth as Son Goku...who will eventually free the Universe from the tyrrany of Frieza and his clan.  Fast forward several decades...  Upon hearing of his brother's humiliating defeat at the hands of a low-level Saiyan monkey, Cooler sets out for the homeworld of this upstart to avenge the honor of his clan.  On Earth the unsuspecting Z Warriors Goku, Gohan, Krillin, Oolong & the Haiya Dragon are on a camping expedition, when they are suddenly assaulted by the (hilariously effeminate) henchmen of Cooler...Cooler's Armored Squadron.  Krillin is laid low before Goku can return from fishing to do battle with the Squadron.  After making sport of the Squadron, Goku is confronted by their villainous leader...Cooler!  At first Goku mistakes Cooler for Frieza...but this mistake is soon rectified, as this being is vastly more powerful than the maniacal tyrant Goku faced on Namek.  Gohan attempts to aid his Father in the battle, but merely becomes a target for the merciless Cooler's attack.  Goku is badly hurt saving his son & is forced to make a tactical withdrawal from the battlefield to nurse his quite serious wounds.  Krillin is roused by the Haiya Dragon, as well & joins the pair in a nearby cave.  In the meantime the Squadron has been tearing up the landscape in an attempt to destroy Goku...causing much devestation.  Inadvertantly, while rescuing some trapped animals at Goku's request, Oolong is nearly crushed by a rock and is barely saved by an energy blast from Krillin.  Unfortunately, the blast is picked up by the Squadron's scouters and they are drawn to the source of the blast.  Gohan is sent to Korin Tower to procure a few Senzu Beans, aboard the Haiya Dragon Express.  After getting a hard time from Korin, Yajirobi hands over a huge bag of Senzu, plus one that Gohan places in his sash.  On his return trip Haiya Dragon sets of the Squadron's Scouters and they close in on the boy.  Gohan is battered by the Squadron until a timely rescue is intiated by Gohan's mentor, Piccolo.  Piccolo annihilates the squadron while Gohan brings the Senzu to his ailing Father.  Piccolo's victory is short-lived, however as he is quickly dispatched at the hands of Cooler, who sends the sole remaining member of the Squadron, Salza, to deal with Gohan.  Gohan arrives at the cave, but before he can aid his Father, the entire sack of Senzu is incinerated by Salza.  Krillin does battle with Salza, but is overcome.  In the meantime Gohan remembers the Senzu he stashed in his sash and gives it to Goku.  Renewed, Goku emerges from the cave.  Brushing off Salza like a flea, Goku goes into battle with Cooler.  Having a more difficult with the Saiyan than he'd anticipated, Cooler initiates a transformation into his fourth form, with augmented muscle growth, a huge crest above his head, heightened speed & endurance & an overall increased ability to kick Saiyan ass.  Goku launches an all-out offensive against Cooler...but to no avail.  Cooler, in his new form, is simply too powerful for the Saiyan warrior to overcome, even using his powerful Kaio-Ken technique.  Faced with his ultimate defeat and the destruction of Earth, Goku once again transforms into the mighty Super Saiyan...and proceeds to hand Cooler a whoopin'.  Nonplussed, Cooler gathers a huge ball of energy and pitches it at Goku, & the Earth...  Goku is determined, however, and sends the energy back at Cooler, launching him into space.  Before Cooler is incinerated in the fiery funace of the Sun, he realizes his error.  This was the Sayian he allowed to escape!  He could have avoided his destruction with ease!
This is the fifth DBZ movie and one of the better ones.  It is a bit above average, as some of the character actually (GASP!) interact!  It is standard FUNimation ADR, with lots of added dialogue & the ever present hard rock ... sountrack, I hear a lot of complaints about this, but it's miles better than the Casiotone crapola which adorns the original Japanese. Overall a lot of fun & a decently thought-out story, 4.5 stars.",1024099200,,4666,4.919437340153452

1655650,5,B00005RJ01,"This featurette is only 45 minutes but you really get your moneys worth.  Along the line of short side episode style films as Lord Slug, History of Trunks, and Bardock Father of Goku, this title packs a enough action to last through somethinmg Like Garlic Junior or Cell in the short time period of at most 2 episodes.
The story takes palce after we meet Trunks, during the three year intermission before the Androids or Cell show up.  Coller finds out a Saiyin killed Freiza, although not at to much of a loss he feels that his Families Honor has been ruined by this travesty.  He then journeys to Earth with his own Ginyu FOrce style group and decides to take out Goku (although he doesn't know who killed Freiza).  From there the action doesn't stop as Goku, Gohan, Krillion, and Piccolo fight to stop Cooler from his revenge.
For the most part I like this and gave it 5 stars because I am a preety solid DBZ fan and am dedicated to it to a certain extent.  I purchase the side stories (that won't be aired on TV) and just enjoy it.  However if you are not a Dragon Ball Z fan then chances are you should probably watch the series and see if you like that, and hold off on purchasing this.",1018396800,,1192,4.299107142857143
1655651,5,B00005RJ01,"This has been one of my favorite DBZ stories since I first watched it over a decade ago.  The flow of the battles, timing, artistic composition, and scene direction are all fantastically done.  To watch this in the original Japanese is truly 45 minutes well spent, even if you can't understand a word of it.  I should know.  I've done just that more times than I can count.
However, to watch the Funimation English dub of this film is like watching someone set fire to the Mona Lisa.  All of the dramatic silences, perfectly timed music, and short, to the point dialogues are scrapped in favor of constant babbling by nails-on-the-chalkboard irritating American voice actors and totally inappropriate pop music.  At times it seems that the English script is being made up as they go along!
Luckily for us, you may watch this DVD in the original Japanese with directly translated subtitles to match.  It is only by this saving grace that I rate it a 5 star DVD.  However, if you'd like to conduct a small study in abysmal US translation, try watching it in English with the Japanese version subtitles on-screen.  You'll hear Cooler say, ""I wanna just blow this planet up, and I will"", but see on-screen that he actually said, ""It would be easy to destroy this planet, but my pride will not allow it.""  You'll read that Karin scolds Gohan for not climbing up from the bottom of his tower, but hear Gohan appologize for not bringing a gift!  And possibly worst of all, you'll hear characters spout endless, nonsensical trash-talk about how much pain they're going to inflict, while in the original Japanese they just stood calmly, staring each other down with confidence.
It's amazing how arrogant we Americans can be.  Does Funimation actually think they are IMPROVING on the original by lazily throwing in bad pop music and idiotic jokes, and changing key story elements for no reason?  Please, Funimation.  In the future, stick to the script.  Distribution rights DO NOT make you Akira Toriyama.",1014249600,4,1995,4.792397660818714
1655652,5,B00005RJ01,"I wasn't very pleased with the fourth DBZ movie, because of the flat out dry plot and Goku's so-called Super Saiyan transformation. When I heard that the fifth DBZ movie ""Cooler's Revenge"" is about to come to our shores, I already knew from the start that it would be even better than the four early DBZ movies, because I already seen movie clips of it and read countless reviews about it. Finally, I own one, and believe me, I wasn't disappointed at all. The DVD menus were great ! Better than the ones seen on ""The History of Trunks"" and ""Lord Slug"". When I selected the play option, I was introduced to a way better DBZ movie with better animation, deep plot, and amazing fighting scenes. The movie starts off when Bardcok and the rest of Planet Vegeta were destroyed by Frieza's death ball (as seen in Bardock: The Father of Goku). Frieza's older brother, Cooler and his armored squadron were watching Planet Vegeta explode into smitherines. While the ball was slowly falling on the planet, Cooler's squadron spotted a Saiyan pod with a baby Saiyan in it. It was Kakarot, soon to be named Goku ! The squadron was about to shoot it down, but Cooler stopped them and suggested that his brother should take care of it himself. Years after Frieza was killed by Goku's enormous powers, Cooler heard the news by Salza and the rest of his crew. Cooler didn't care about Frieza's death nor does he want to avenge his death, he just wants to get back at the man who stomped all over his family pride. And that man is none other than Goku. When Goku, Gohan, Oolong, Icarus, and Krillin go on a camping trip, they found themselves surrounded by Cooler's armored squadron. It's up to Goku to stop Frieza's brother, Cooler from causing destruction to Earth. Well, I can't spoil any surprises, but I can give you a few pointers on how this movie is like. First off, the plot is much, much, much deeper and much more interesting than that of ""Lord Slug"". The animation is even slicker and brighter than the other DBZ movies that I've ever seen. No other DBZ movie has ever looked this great. The voice acting still remains the same. Simply put...slightly weird, and pretty cool ! I really liked the English voice actor who played Cooler. It's a good thing they didn't use a woman's voice to play as him. The voice actor who played as Salza, sounds like a wannabe mexican gangster. That's what FUNimation always does. Every weird or cool looking character they see, they will give them a weird accent like a French, British, Scottish, or even a Mexican accent. That's just plain out stupid, but I have no problem with it. It's not really that much of a problem. If it continues to go out of control, I will get sick of it. But as of now, it's okay ! The most amazing aspect to this movie are the transformations. When Cooler goes to his final state of transformation, his body nearly resembles that of a samurai warrior without the swords and gadgets. And finally, Goku transforms into a real Super Saiyan. And no, the fourth movie wasn't the first to ever have the Super Saiyan feature. ""Cooler's Revenge"" is the first DBZ movie to ever have the Super Saiyan transformation scene, and Goku looks well animated when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. And as always, the action is definently eye catching, especially the part when Salza and Piccolo battle it out inside the tree area of the forest. It's like watching a samurai anime, only with flying techiniques and the use of special abilities. The ending was great. Although appearing to be a bit average, it's perfect. The only thing I hated about the movie was the Spanish version. I'm not saying that I'm racist towards Mexicans, but the opening and closing music they translated, sounded weird. That's pretty much it. So in conclusion of this review, this is the far by, the best DBZ movie ever created. If you're thinking about seeing DBZ in a whole new level, look no further than ""Cooler's Revenge"".",1013990400,11,3947,4.6
1655653,5,B00005RJ01,"In the early days, Pioneer released three Dragonball movies. Now, FUNimation has tried they're hand at DBZ movies. Lord Slug wasn't that entertaining, but Cooler's Revenge is by far the best DBZ movie ever made.

The story starts off with when Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta. Cooler watches from a distance and decides to let the fleeing Kakarrot go. Fast forward to the time after Frieza is killed by Goku. Cooler, infuriated by hearing of his brother's death, decides to go to Earth and put an end to Goku. After his boys make quick work of Piccolo, Krillin and Gohan, it is up to Goku to defeat Cooler.
The movie moves at a fairly fast pace. What I enjoyed the most was the explosive fight scenes. There is tons of action here. One of my favorites is when Cooler pushes his way through Goku's Kamehameha wave and then pops out and punches him. Very nice.
The English version features hard rock music by various artists like Disturbed and Deftones. Given the choice between FUNimation TV dub music and the rock music, the choice is obvious. I think it fits the action pretty well. For those of you who dislike the English version, the inclusion of the Japanese dub AND Spanish dub will more than tide you over to buy this title.
Overall, Cooler's Revenge is pretty much the best 45 minutes movie you will ever see. Lots of action and lots of great animation.",1013385600,10,1484,4.625
1655654,5,B00005RJ01,"This was one of the best videos out of the whole movie series. To make it better, there is a good chance when you buy the movie, you can get three rare Cooler cards. Well anyway,Goku,Gohan,Krillan,Oolong, and Ikerus go on a camping trip. But it is disturbed by Friaza's evil {and stronger} brother Cooler. This is one of the two movies Cooler's suppose to star in. But in his second movie he appears as Metal Cooler. Not to spoil anything but you will see Super Saiyans Goku and Vegeta{this is amazeily the first movie Vegeta will fight in it}. But the first movie of Cooler's is really good. If you take the time to buy the movie,you may get three rare Cooler Cards. And don't forget to buy the Buu Saga. Yeah,I mean the WHOLE SAGA!!!!!!I can't wait and Buu starts absorbing.",1013212800,,776,4.471830985915493
1655655,3,B00005RJ01,"I have to say that the script has been translated well, subtitle-wise.  The English dubbed version isn't that bad either, amazingly.  My only problem is that they changed the aspect ratio of the film to fit the TV.  Now, I don't know if it's just my copy or all the copies, but when I first saw this film, it was in a slightly wider aspect ratio.  Similar to the Lord Slug feature.  If I had known this, I wouldn't have bought this DVD at all, being a big DBZ fan and having followed the series since 1985.  I suppose you can't get everything.",1011744000,,543,4.223300970873787
1655656,5,B00005RJ01,"I think this movie is one of the quality movies that the creator of DBZ made. Even though this is only the 5th movie out of 13 that are to be made, it is still great to watch Cooler get his butt kicked by Goku, it is like watching the Freeza Saga all over again but in a smaller time frame!(Laugh Out Loud).I gave this movie a  5 stars because it has great quality and should be enjoyed by most anime or cartoon lovers",1011657600,,418,3.9761904761904763
1655657,4,B00005RJ01,"I made a couple of particularly embarrassing gaffes in my last review, so allow me to reiterate.
DBZ Movie #5 is actually one of the better installments in the hit-or-miss DBZ Movie series, even with Goku spending most of the film injured. Highlights include Gohan's meeting with Karin and Yajirobe, Goku taking out Cooler's personal Ginyu team, and a certain green-skinned guest star who makes an appearance.
Still, I must confess I can't stand the marketing behind these movies. I originally thought the first three movies had been released with their original box art and titles, but I was informed that this was not the case. However, that doesn't change the fact that ""Cooler's Revenge"" is still a stupid title. Cooler shows up again in Movie #6, so what are they gonna call that? ""The Revenge of Cooler's Revenge""? And that box art just screams ""ugly"".
Anyway, if you don't have 20+ hours to spend following a 300-part storyline, give this movie a try for a quick and enjoyable beginning, middle, and end.",1010534400,9,1011,4.8497109826589595
