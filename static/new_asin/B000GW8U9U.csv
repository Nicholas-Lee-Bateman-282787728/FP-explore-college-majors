2620237,3,B000GW8U9U,"The start of the season promises the team gets captured by mysterious Gen Hunt Stockwell after succeded in a mission he orders,they sent to a military prision and charged to death after a court martial where they are found guilty of robbing the bank of Hanoi on orders from Col Morrison.

Murdock changes the bullets from the firing squad and they are shot with blanks. Transported to a warehouse Stockwell proposes a series of missions that must be completed in order to get full pardon. Here starts the declive of the series,no good eps at all,the actors lacks of chemistry and confidence and all is a chessy product. The music score is changed however and we see the father of Face and himself injured in a mob hit.

The package have 2 eps summaries mixed up(The Point Of No Return and The Theory of a Revolution).Series creator Stephen J Cannell gives a brief speech about how the series was concived but no behind the scenes or actors featurettes are included.

Hope the upcoming film have sucess.",1162080000,7,1002,4.681818181818182
2620238,5,B000GW8U9U,"I totally agree with K.L...this season of The A-Team was excellent! I was only a kid when it was aired, so didn't remember much, but when I watched it daily about 7 or 8 years ago, I loved it. Season 5 is very different than 1-4, and I was apprehensive at first when I saw a change, (I get irked when that happens, afraid that it'll be ruined.) But it turned out that they succeeded in making it even better! (Even the theme music, LOL!) So definitely buy this season, it's definitely worth it...even just to see the episode where Face gets shot! Uh oh, I left you a teaser! ;)",1159574400,10,577,4.207207207207207
2620239,5,B000GW8U9U,"True, I'm posting the first review before it is released (Oct. 10)
later this Fall. But, I'll say that this Season is one of the best, and it's hard for me to choose. I won't ruin too much
for those who will be viewing season 5 for the first time
after this release. I'll just say the A-Team go through
VERY interesting changes (a Court Martial, the CIA and
Firing Squad are involved, that's all I'll say). If you've
seen any of the other seasons & you have a real appreciation
or are a real fan, BUY SEASON 5.
I'll post another review on the actual quality of the DVD's,
packaging & special features (if there's any) after the release.

Well, this part of my review is after I have purchased this DVD set.
Of course, the episodes themselves are excellent. And the quality
is pretty good. Good enough. That goes for the sound as well.
One problem with labelling. Two episode plots are switched in the wrong
places: Theory of Revolution & Point of no Return. Just switch these
two plots when you read them. Bonehead move by the manufacturers.
And, the special feature was just OK. Stephen J. Cannell spoke briefly
about the a-team. To me, he seemed somewhat gratified by it's success.
But, not as proud as he should be of this great series. Overall,
get this DVD set for the great episodes & to complete your collection.
Thanks for reading my long long review.",1158278400,7,1359,4.479838709677419

2620261,2,B000GW8U9U,"I  own  all  5  seasons.  &  I  like  all  of  them  except  this  one.  First  off  the  theme  song  has  changed,  &  you  got  the  new  characters  Frankie  &  Stockwell  (Robert Vaughn)  who  saved  them  from  being  executed.  Because  Stockwell  also  helps  to  keep  the  law  at  bay  from  them  they  must  continue  to  go  on  missions  assigned  by  Stockwell.  Also  it  sort  of  makes  you  wonder,  Is  this  the  best  Stockwell  could  do  for  them,  as  far  as  their  agreement  goes?  He  must  of  had  good  lawyers.  Robert  Vaughn  is  a  pretty  good  boss  man  in  pretty  much  every  movie.  Knows  how  to  make  things  happen.  In  my  opinion  he's  a  pretty  good  actor.  Here  he  keeps  them  pretty  busy,  &  doesn't  give  them  too  much  off  time.  Its  like  the  A Team  is  now  his  property.
There  is  really  nothing  that  amusing  from  this  season.  I  still  watch  it.  Just  not  very  often.  Will  they  ever  be  able  to  get  off  the  hook  completely?  Stockwell  gave  them  a  lucky  break,  but  his  request  was  a  hell  of  thing  as  far  as  returning  the  favor  goes.  The  first  3  episodes  of  this  season  were  okay.  Perfect  plan  by  Murdoch  (Dwight Schultz)  &  Frankie  &  Stockwell  on  how  to  rescue  the  other  3.
It  wasn't  so  bad  that  I  refused  to  watch  it.  But  I  don't  think  anyone  can  really  get  too  much  satisfactory  from  season  5.",1474761600,,1462,4.198312236286919

2620291,5,B000GW8U9U,"Okay, let's be honest... we all know The A-Team is amazing, fun, thrilling, action-packed, and entertaining.  Those of you who've watched all of the shows compulsively know what I'm talking about.  Sorry, but I don't need to spend time with y'all.  You've already come to the Dark Side.

For those of you who haven't grown up with it and never seen it, you're in for it.  Better not watch it.  You might become one of... THEM - the fans who watch The A-Team in an never-ending marathon.

But seriously, it's a great show.  What is it about?  Well, listen - err - read the Narrator:  ""In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team."" (Quote from IMDB: The A-Team (19831987): Quotes)

Now you know what it's about.  You should really watch it.  Just a couple episodes... or maybe all of them.  Who knows?  You could become one of THEM!",1415318400,,1159,4.478468899521531

2620307,4,B000GW8U9U,"Robert Vaughn is a cool addition to the cast for the show's fifth/final season.  Vaughn portrays a secretive government type who manages to recruit the A-Team to do special missions with the promise of a future pardon.  The adventures are as explosive as previous seasons while often taking on an international flair with national security at stake.  The A-Team themselves remain mostly unchanged, but a fast talking special effects expert joins the roster on a regular basis.  The new character really seems unneeded, often appearing like a younger, less adept version of the Face character.  Never a show concerned with reality, this season of The A-Team offers an abundant amount of action, stunts and humor including some sly parodies of the era's successful big screen franchises.",1402444800,,785,5.198412698412699
2620308,5,B000GW8U9U,"My wife and I grew up watching shows like The A Team , Greatest American Hero and the like. I had one of my grandsons over the other night and he said, ""Grandpa, it's nice to be able to watch a TV show with you that we can both see together."" That really struck me, it was really fun to watch some of these great old shows with two of my very young grandsons, one 5 and one 9 years old. There aren't many shows on TV today that you can allow your young children to watch due to objectionalble material, so this is a great way to enjoy, TV with the younger kids in the family and not have to watch some mindless crap cartoon show, additionally, there are NO commercials either, an added bonus.

However, I still made my way through it and I encourage other fans not to ignore it. We see the other sides of the guys, and we also learn a few things about them that we might not have learned other wise.

The actual DVDs are different from how the other seasons are set up, and this is probably due to the smaller amount of episodes. The three discs are all just one-sided instead of double-sided (which in my opinion is much easier). The case is your typical DVD case and everything was in order when I received it.

2620335,5,B000GW8U9U,"Season 5 is a shadow of the first 4 seasons by far. By Season 5, the presense of Mr. T is barely seen in each episode; one can only guess that his part in the show was cut down significantly by 1986. In truth, the true star of the show in this and in Season 4 was Dwight Shultz, whose character of H.M. Murdock truly took center stage in over half of the episodes. Season 5 seems to have been specificaly written for him. The shows lost most of their comedic appeal by 1986-87, and became more spy/espionage thrillers than ""Soldiers of Fortune"" chronicles. The initial trilogy of the pilot episode of this season was excellent, finally giving the history of The A-Team in detail, and including Murdock as a part of the Team. A good watch for nostalgia buffs, even if it only lasted 13 episodes; I guess the machine gun/tech craze of the early to mid 80's was dying out by now.... The change to the Main Theme song was at the same time cool but uncool, as the opening trademark dialogue ""In 1972..."" was missed.

I love the first four seasons and I just received the fifth season and the episodes I have seen are really good. I do have to get use to that Frankie character still as well as Stockwell but still the shows are good. I've only seen the episodes on the first disk and the third disk since Amazon.com sent me a season five package with two disk three's but I have contacted them and they are sending a replacement with two day shipping and thankfully no charge to me, so hopefully disc two will be with this new set that is coming and I will then get to see those episodes as well.",1244073600,,672,3.9851851851851854

2620338,5,B000GW8U9U,I really enjoyed A-Team as a child.  I remember looking forward to it coming on.  I have all of the A-Team season.  When I saw this here on Amazon at this price I knew I needed to get it.  Great great DVD for anyone collection.,1208390400,,227,3.977777777777778
2620339,3,B000GW8U9U,"This abbreviated 1986-87 Season of The A-Team was the worst season of them all since this was the season when this show took a major nose-dive since the team makes a big transition from being for hire and on the run from the Army to being assigned to a mission by Gen. Stockwell(Robert Vaughn), which the team seemed to despise leaving kind of love hate relationship with Stockwell, which made the show kind of cheesy and less interesting and less sophisticated with less action than the first 4 seasons along with the fact that this was the season when the ratings went down the toilet since everything on this action-packed show started going stale and ran out of steam with no sufficient new ideas making it obvious by the Winter of 1987 that this show wasn't going in the right direction either which resulted in NBC cancelling the A-TEAM in the Spring of 1987.

Therefore, you could say that Stockwell killed the thunder and popularity of this show causing it to go stale, since the team being for hire and on the run from the military is part of what made The A-Team so popular during the first 4 years of that show, but since Stockwell captured the A-Team in the Fifth Season, it was like the team was kissing up to him ever since in order to keep the military from continuing to attempt catching them, but the A-Team would always seem to be so reluctant going on whatever mission Stockwell assigned them, unlike the case in the first 4 seasons, because for instance, whenever the A-Team got hired after Hannibal would do a screening out process interview with each client who wanted to hire the A-Team in the first 4 years of that show.

Therefore, it was like the team was always kissing ass to Stockwell after Stockwell saved the team from being executed after their trial when things didn't work well for the team in court causing the team to be indebted to Stockwell for the rest of their lives, which I'm sure was another reason why this show tanked in this season.

This 1986-1987 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to NBC"", since that was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1986 thru the Summer of 1987.",1201219200,9,2163,4.512755102040816
2620340,3,B000GW8U9U,"I personally love this show, but this season first of all is a ripoff because it's only like half a season, but also I can't stand the fact that they never properly ended the series. There is a few good episodes thrown in here, so don't get me wrong, but for one if you watch closely to the last 2 episodes, in the last one Murdock is wearing a T-Shirt that says Almost Fini, or something to that effect, but in the second last episode he's wearing a shirt that says FINI. So the last episode is really THE GREY TEAM, not WITHOUT RESERVATIONS. So if you do buy this set, the only thing I can recommend is to watch the last 2 episodes in that order.

As for the season, I find it's overpriced for the amount of episodes that you get. I think it should be a lower price considering theres only 13 episodes. Storywise though, they should have ended the series with the 3 part season 5 premiere episode, and left it there, and it would have been a proper way to end the show. But I guess I can't get past the fact that the series didn't get a proper sendoff, or final episode.

I did like the fact that they remixed the theme song for this season, and the addition of Frankie was a good idea, cuz it brought some new blood into the series. So to properly review this season of the series, if you're expecting a proper end to the series, go elsewhere, but if you just wanna see some good A-Team episodes, there is a few in here, but Season 3 was really the peak of the series, and was the best season thus far, although Season 4 was pretty good also. I find season 4 was just a tad under what season 3 was quality wise.

So for fans of the A-Team (like myself) I recommend the seasons in the following order (Seasons 3,4,2,1,5). Seasons 1 and 5 have the least amount of episodes. Season 1 has 14, and Season 5 has 13.

So I give this season 3 stars. The picture quality is pretty good, the sound is I think 2.0 Mono, might be stereo, not sure, but it is really good quality. Only beef I have with this season is some of the content of the episodes and the lack of episodes, with no final episode.",1197072000,3,2091,4.1302211302211305
2620341,3,B000GW8U9U,"I love the A-Team and find it hard to say anything negative about it,but I'd have to say that the last Season was mixed for me. The Season Four Finale""The Sound Of Thunder""was supose to be an introduction for Hannibal's long lost Daughter from Vietnam Tia Lione(Ithink that's how you spell her name any)and she would be the the new member at the start of Season 5. However,she was on a Soap Opra and when Season 5 started couldn't get out of her contract. So...that's when Franky ""Dishpan"" Santana was introduced.

Don't get me wrong I think the Actor who played him was a tremendous Actor and really tried to add to the show. But I never really thought he fit in quite well enough in the show. Now,in my opinion I think the first three episodes of Season 5 were the best episodses ever made in the show. And that alone would justify buying this season. But only two or three others are good.
the rest are just dull and in my opinion poorly written. One thing I didn't like about this Season was all the Episodes that involved Stockwell himself,although I think he was an excellent charecter to the series unlike Santana.

And I think everyone can agree that the last episode was a HUUUUUGE disapointment and not at all a fitting ending. I think it should been a two parter in which Stockwell sends them on one final mission for thier Pardons and he doublecrosses them,they avert it and kill Stockwell. But,that never happened did it?Of course not. What we got instead was a whiney little girl running around with a an old geezer untill they get to retirement home?WHAT!?And instead of the A-Team being the main focus a bunch of decrepid old people(not that I have a problem with older people at all)fight off covert rogue agents. DUMB!

Well,at any rate it's worth buying for at least 4 passible episodes and 4 great ones. I'm not saying don't buy,because I'd be lying if I said that. But for those who aren't hardcore A-Team Fans like myself and vaguely follow the series or never even seen it before,I wouldn't recommend getting this Season. Get the rest(Season 3 is the best by the way)and then maybe if you get fond for the A-Team THEN buy Season 5.",1191196800,2,2154,4.532133676092545
2620342,4,B000GW8U9U,"With ""The A-Team: Season Five - The Final Season"" on DVD, you can enjoy the final thirteen episodes of one of television's greatest action shows. However, this was definitely the worst season of the show. This doesn't mean that the final season is horrible, but it's nowhere near as good as it had been in previous seasons. The format of the final season is drastically different. The tone of the show is dark this time around, and even the humor cannot hide this fact. Even the season's best episode, ""The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair,"" is very dark, and has one of the few instances of a character actually dying ON camera.

The whole idea of the A-Team working for a top-secret organization within the U.S. government never really works. The Stockwell character is useless for the most part, and Frankie Santana is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen on a T.V. show. But still, there were some good episodes, such as ""Trial by Fire"" (which features one of the greatest Murdock moments ever), the aforementioned ""Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair,"" and the exciting, hilarious penultimate episode of the show, ""The Grey Team."" Overall, this was a decent ending to one of television's greatest shows. Fans of the show will enjoy it.

2620349,4,B000GW8U9U,"Season Five of The A-Team often gets bashed, and to some degree it's warranted.  The A-Team joining forces with General Stockwell holding them by the leash was awful since it never went anywhere.  These guys are suppose to be soldiers of fortune, outlaws for hire who play by their own rules, and now they're being controlled by someone else.  Then they added in Frankie Santana and forced him into a more prominent role than some other Team members.  I could see Frankie in an Amy or Tonya recurring role, but he got too much attention for my tastes.  The Simpsons once spoofed the fact that TV shows tend to add in new characters when they're desparate and that's exactly how Frankie and Stockwell came off.

To top it off, some of the stories were awful and the production quality was horrible.  I know the production continuity wasn't perfect by any means during the other seasons, but it just seemed like they started to give up altogether.  The final episode, The Grey Team, was down right awful.  Come on, you got Frankie and B.A. running scared of a bunch of old folks?  B.A.?!  Watch the part where the car goes flying through the air then it cuts to a shot of the car dropping straight down.  Bad...really bad production.

But for all the negatives, there were positives.  While some of the stories were bad, I thought some were excellent, too.  The opening threesome of The A-Team's capture, trial, and escape was very well done.  The episode where Face learns about his dying father and his sister is another one I liked.  It's that kind of character development, learning more about their backgrounds and tying up loose ends that really lacked in the first four seasons, and that was very refreshing to see.

All in all, it was obvious they made a change of direction during Season Five and that they were desparate to make something work.  Unfortunately, there were too many issues from stories to production quality that made this season less than memorable.  It still had it's moments and it had some good character development as well, but the addition of Stockwell and Frankie definitely made it a different cup of tea that not all A-Team fans appreciated.",1163721600,23,2174,4.701058201058201

Synopsis: The A-team protects a legitimate escort service from being taken over
by organized crime.

INT - VAN - DAY

Hannibal, Face and BA are on their way to spring Murdoch for the next assignment. BA as usual is driving.

BA: Where to now Hannibal?

Hannibal: Just a few more miles up this road. I'll let you know when we get close.

Face: So what's the assignment?

Hannibal: This one's right up your alley Face. Another Damsel in distress.

Hannibal flips through a folder and shows Face the clients picture...

Face: Hmm?

Hannibal: Not your cup of tea?

Face: On the contrary. I'd say that she's definitely the kind you could take home
to Mother.

BA: You can tell that just by looking at a picture?

Hannibal shows him the picture.

BA: I take that back. You and your Mother must think alike cause I know my mama would never approve!

They all laugh.

Hannibal: Turn left up here BA.

ANOTHER ANGLE: The Van turns up a street.

Face: Uh, where did you say we were going Hannibal?

Hannibal: We are going to pick Murdoch up at a pie factory.

BA: A pie factory? They must be crazier than that foo to let him out!

Hannibal: I can't say that his being around us has made his condition any better,
but it certainly seems he has made some progress if they are allowing
him to hold a job.

Face: Well good for him.

They pull into a parking lot at the factory.
