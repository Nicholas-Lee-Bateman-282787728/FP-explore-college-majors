The plot revolves around the idea that Nazi scientists discover a means to develop synthetic fuels and lubricants from coal. This of course becomes an issue of utmost importance to the big oil companies. Realizing that with the mass production of synthetic fuel they would no longer be able to control and maintain their colossal profits they set out to keep this ""formula"" secret - hidden until the appropiate time. This sets the stage for this movie. The acting is high caliber across the board. I highly recommend this movie - it is closer to the truth than most poeple will want to believe.",1189728000,4,839,5.6141732283464565
461838,4,6302413621,"Even though this film was made 27 years ago, it applies to our oil & political situation today, as no other, and may even convince you of it's truth; how would we know? The opening of the film is perfect, totally putting the viewer in the picture. Richard Lynch is fabulous as the calculating Nazi officer and the dialogue is right on the mark. Too bad they didn't dwell just a tad more on the set-up, this film is so good, they could have fleshed things out and ran at 2 1/2 to 3 hours without any lapse of interest.  Brando, of course, is wonderful as the oil company exec, and the film is loaded with classic character actors like the wonderful Wolfgang Preiss, and Beatrice Straight. Scott is intense, as always and Marthe Keller is spot-on. A fine music score and atmospheric cinematography complete the picture. My one caveat, some minor Hollywood politically correct nonsense about Scott's Asian partner, a total waste of time in an otherwise wonderful and highly thoughtful film.",1184371200,2,987,4.705202312138728
461839,3,6302413621,"This film had a lot going for it -- an interesting and timely story about Nazis, world fuel supplies, and high gas prices; a bunch of great actors including Marlon Brando and George C. Scott in his last performance; and solid production values.

Unfortuately, this was all undone because ""The Formula"" -- a formula for alternative fuel devised by the Nazis in World War II and hidden by gas executives -- is the most poorly edited film in movie history. The chain of events in this movie is so incongruous is strains the viewer to stay involved and eventually defeats every viewer's ability to manage the ""plot"".

I'll never forget the day I waited in anticipation of seeing it at the theater when it came out in 1980. While standing in line to enter, my frined from work came out. I asked him how it was. ""You have to keep up with it,"" he said.

Not much question today that he wasn't being cryptic or evasive in his response. This film had everything going for it -- great actors, a timely plot, perhaps even more timely today, great studio values, wonderful lighting, everything except an editor.

Finally, I have two questions: Why wasn't this film re-edited on DVD release? And who is that guy on the DVD cover mimicking a young Marlon Brando? Didn't they see the bald, fat, and old actor that played his part in the movie?",1184284800,7,1328,4.543933054393306
461840,5,6302413621,"This film from 1980 is still worthy of a watch as it is well acted and the story is as important today, maybe more so, as it was when it was originally filmed.  It is about the oil business, its history and current state of affairs hasn't aged this film one bit.  If anything it is an eyeopening exploration of our relationship with the oil cartel, the Nazi world war II formula for a synthetic fuel, International bankers,  and our current oil companies whose agendas continue on.  A thought provoking film and I am so glad it finally came out in DVD.  Great cast that also includes that wonderful German actor, Wolfgang Preiss as the Swiss banker.",1182124800,3,649,4.512820512820513
461841,5,6302413621,"According the classic established patterns  of the narrative line of the great Frederick Forsythe 's this suspenseful picture begins with just at the End of the WW2, when a German Officer is captured with important documents which originally would become a decisive deal to firm an armistice due the potent and extraordinary finding, that previously had been a successful discover; suddenly we go to 1980 in the middle of  a simple murderer but on the road, the investigation will interweave with impressive consequences as a true spider 's web.

A very brief but still engaging appearance of Marlon Brando, but George Scott leads the film in the ninety five per cent of the whole shots. Martha Keller is fabulous and John Gielguld is splendid too.

An intriguing plot with a subject of beating actuality, despite of the quarter of century elapsed.

Admirable camera work and fabulous landscapes. This film is the masterpiece of John Alvidsen",1130112000,4,942,5.051612903225807
461842,4,6302413621,"The quote of this film should be Brando: ""WE ARE THE ARABS!"" The comments that appear in the AMG site about theis film are ludicrous. Who are they supporting, The OIL cmpanies? THE AMG COMPLAINT ABOUT THE FILM  IS ""THE INTERMINABLE STEADY-CAM SCENES.""

THE ACADEMY NOMINATED THE FILM FOR ITS PHOTOGRAPHY!

Now that we have a $3.00 per gallon situation in this country, this film literally HITS THE MARK!",1124496000,6,403,4.811594202898551
461843,4,6302413621,"This film ever has fascinated me although I think as cinema it has only a medium quality and the performance of Marlon Brando isn't good.
  But it's the theme, the plot. We see: Economics, finances, Stock exchange, all these has as main motor petroleum, gasoline, fuel, lubricants. These are the very first lever of the world, but petroleum can't be manufactured: as gold, it's a product of a limited amount, but, What if you truly could find a formula that permits you to make artificial gasoline? It had to be fabulous and terrible for the petrol corporations and for all. I have to say I know very little about petroleum sciences but certainly Germans attained to make it from charcoal. The problem with all this questions is if you have to waste more energy for producing it than these you obtain. There are much questions and I'm not capable to answer any, but as nuclear energy seems to be rejected by common people the perspective of making petrol from coal, a raw material almost inexhaustible, excites me more than nothing.",1081468800,2,1032,4.727777777777778
461844,2,6302413621,"On the surface this film is about a discovery of a method that can produce cheap gas, and ""Big Oil's"" attempt to supress that discovery for decades in the name of profits. The Nazi scientists make the discovery and in an attempt for immunity from prosecution they try to trade the secret to the Allies. Instead, an officer deals the information privately and the oil industry spend the next 40 years hiding the secret and [sipping] up the oil profits.
The movie focuses on George C. Scott as the LAPD investigator who is placed on a murder case. Through cryptic clues and some convenient insight the trail leads to Germany (via Italy) and the Los Angeles officer jumps on a plane. Once there he learns of the secret as he finds more people connected in the international conspiracy. The more he learns the closer the danger comes to Scott himself.
The tension of movie relies on the confrontations between Scott and the myriad of talented actors he interviews. If these were better built they could make for a fun movie despite the plot. Unfortunately, almost all the characters lack any conviction. I don't believe that Scott's character cares at all about the oil or murders. He just wants to win and be done with it. The other characters are worse. Most of the characters are murdered just as soon as the plot no longer needs them ... sometimes seconds after Scott is finished interviewing them. Most of them seem to be working for the best accent/foreign language oscar. There are some thick german accents that aren't understandable and sections of germen dialog that aren't subtitled. Surprisingly, even Sir John Gielgud snarls his way through his dialog. Brando is as usual in his own world. His accent, I can only guess, is supposted to be Southern/Texan? but with his normal lisp doesnt come out too well.
In the end there is nothing special or outstanding about this movie besides the plot, which is unique but suffers from obvious plot devices to manipulate without bothering to construct real characters. Almost as believable as your typical Bond film. There is nothing in this movie you cant find somewhere else (although maybe not altogether) so if these actors are favorites I suggest nearly any other movie. At a minimum rent first. Try JFK, Patton, The Godfather, Julius Caesar, Rocky, The Insider",1014854400,5,2314,4.831234256926952
7825594,4,6302413621,"WONDERFUL story about a formula for alternative fuel discovered in Germany in World War II, then lost in a tangle of Cold War maneuvers, then recovered again... all in a murder mystery set in Germany and Los Angeles. Super cast. My favorite line is from the beginning when an American officer tells a defeated German officer that there are no enemies any longer, only customers. A little cheesy at times, but classic nonetheless.",1396310400,,429,4.890410958904109
7825595,3,6302413621,"Based on a novel by Steve Shagan, Lt. Barney Caine LAPD finds a friend murdered. In pursuit of the culprit he may get mixed up in something so big that we may cringe. Looks like there is a cabal protecting a formula; But where does Barney come in and will he come out alive?

This may have been unique in 1982 but it has been over played lately. Still this makes for a great entertaining who-dun-it movie. Yes it had George C. Scott and Marlon Brando at their best. However it was held together by the rest of the cast.

A side note is that I only had two years of German and they never once used anything past that. It was so simple that they probably did not need the subtitles.

The DVD I watched has a voice over commentary by Steve Shagan.

See another unique mystery with George C. Scott:

7825599,4,6302413621,"This is a greatly underated film. It bombed at the box office when it was released. Undeservedly so, as it's a thought provoking premise bourne out by known facts. It's also prescient in the light of what's taken place since 2001, namely oil corporations and political power.
The commentary's very amusing via the director and scriptwriter. No other extras, but it's very cheap.
In short it's excellent entertainment and the 2 Oscar winners (rando and Scott)and infamous refusers are on top form - well worth the price alone. The picture of Brando on the front cover is nothing like what he looks like - he lokks an awful lot like Dick Cheney in the film (hmm, see what I mean about prescience).",1250899200,,695,4.704918032786885
7825600,2,6302413621,"This DVD release of The Formula from ""VCI Entertainment"" is a DVD-R, not a factory pressed DVD! The picture is also not as clear as a version I had previously rented from Netflix.

I guess it's not a big deal since it's only 4.99 but you would think Amazon would mention somewhere that it's a DVD-R anybody could have pressed on their computer. If I would have known that, I would have just made a copy of the one I rented.",1222300800,2,423,4.222222222222222

On the downside, George C. Scott's performance did not totally fit the character, but I think the script needed some character transitions to make it all work better.",1221436800,,432,4.584415584415584

7825603,3,6302413621,"This (I suspect) must have been an intriguing book of the page-turning type. Plot-heavy, you could always go back and re-read the bits you hadn't taken in from the start. As a film, however, it lacks drama, and I think it must be because the writer was just not fully aware how visual entertainment works, either on the screen or on the stage. There is a lack of emotional engagement from and between every single character: each one merely seems to be reading his lines from the book. These are good actors, so it's not so obvious, but the whole thing is like a jigsaw puzzle none of whose pieces quite fit. Moreover, the actors all seem to know this: I suppose it's the director's fault, as well as the writer's. None of these thespians seem at home. G.C.Scott is dead serious, but he convinces neither as a father nor as a lover: these are not roles he's comfortable with. Gielgud's appearance, and performance, is startlingly out-of-place. Brando looks as if he's on a frolic of his own, in an ill-fitting suit, pug nose, lip-padding, and the kind of haircut that always worries you whenever you see one. No. It's kind of interesting, but I couldn't call it good. The Jefferson quote was impressive.",1190332800,3,1203,4.626168224299065
