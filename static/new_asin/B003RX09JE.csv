8403924,4,B003RX09JE,"I think they made a different version of this video cause I don't remember the computer graphics when I watched it as a kid, I remember it as models and the voices are different cause I remember Nicholas sounding a bit older and Hiram sounding wiser and I think that they had a different one made for kids.

Not saying I hated it, I loved this movie as a child and I forgot about it for many years till I saw it on a website of old train movies.

For the price I paid for this was good, I'll hold on to this video for my kid one day.",1514246400,,533,3.8807339449541285
