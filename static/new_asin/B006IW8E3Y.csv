4991722,5,B006IW8E3Y,"This is one of my favorite movies. Nadine Labaki portrays a very interesting story about sectarianism and reconciliation and that is something almost the whole MENA region is going through, especially with the current developments aka Arab Spring. The actors in the movie were being themselves, hence, no over-acting which added up to the movie being awesome. I heard Nadine picked the amature actors based on their personality and that the real life personality is similar to the one in the story and in which the actors portrayed the characters beautifully.
The setting is great and so is the production. Oh, I should mention the music as well. Khaled's compositions are just so delightful to the ears. Just watch the goddamn movie, okay?",1339545600,10,740,5.024390243902439
4991723,4,B006IW8E3Y,"""Where Do We Go Now?"" (2011 release from Lebanon; 100 min.) brings the fictitious story of an isolated village in Lebanon where Christians and Muslims, tired of the endless and senseless killing of/by the Christian and Muslim men, are living together more or less in peace. The opening scenes show the village women, both Christian and Muslim, marching together towards the cemetery where they put down pictures of their fallen husbands, sons and other male family members.

But the peace is threatened at times, not just by petty local events such as the strange disappearance of shoes from the mosque, but more so by watching the news on the one working television in the village, showing increased tension between Muslims and Christians. The women in the village decide that they need to ease the tension by whatever means possible. To say much more of the plot would be to ruin the viewing experience of this movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

This is a beautiful and touching movie. Props first of all to Nadine Labaki, the director/co-writer/star of the movie (she plays one of the key women roles). It wasn't until the movie's credits roled that I realized that Labaki was one of the main performers in the movie. While at times there is a light tone to the movie, we are quickly reminded of the absurd nature of the long-held mistrust between people from different religions. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. If you are looking for a sophisticated yet entertaining foreign movie, by all means check this out. ""Where Do We Go Now?"" is highly recommended!",1337558400,46,1603,4.783393501805054

4991739,5,B006IW8E3Y,Fantastic movie. I forgot about the subtitles after the first 5 minutes. Most amazing part is the fact that none of the cast had acting experience or training yet achieved academy award performances.,1457481600,,199,5.0606060606060606

4991747,5,B006IW8E3Y,This is our most recommended film lately.  The women in this village will stop at nothing to change their families' lives that are threatened by the surrounding war and the seemingly insatiable male need to behave aggressively. Funny and poignant - 2 thumbs up!  The only disappointment was the quality of the film - very grainy!

4991769,4,B006IW8E3Y,"I agree with all the wonderful reviews here. They captured the essence of the movie and, sometimes, even more:) I, too, liked it for the atmosphere the women created, the sense of sisterhood (might not be the most appropriate word), the feeling that you got that you wanted to befriend them, you wanted to be part of what they had. Their nonverbal communication and their direct, sometimes abrupt, no-nonsense style give that sense of strong bond among them. I particularly liked a scene in which one of the women tries to hide the death of her son and tells everybody he has mumps. For the moment, she seems to get away with it, but sometimes later a group of women come to her door and tell her they know her son had mumps when he was little, so what does she try to hide? It's one of the many bitter-sweet moments in the movie. I didn't give it a full 5 star, because I felt something was missing, I can't tell what right now, but maybe somebody else in other reviews has been able to articulate it.",1413158400,3,1002,4.363636363636363

4991772,5,B006IW8E3Y,I enjoyed this very much. The reality of such Muslim Christian friendship and co-operation is sadly not that realistic but one has to admire the sentiment and the acting and style of the film is delightful. The transfer to disc is excellent with some very worthwhile interviews. Locked to Region A which is a pity for European or Australian customers but hopefully it will be released there soon.

4991778,5,B006IW8E3Y,"This drama is one of those hard-to-watch windows into a foreign land, in which a Westerner can catch a glimpse of what daily life must be like to people whose home is in a place like Lebanon.
The premise of this story involves a village with both Muslim and Christian neighbors. Left to themselves, this group would continue on in relative peace, however, the violent outside world finds its way into even this isolated village.
My take on the story is that it offers a hopeful somewhat-surprising ending. Viewers who are tempted to turn it off part way through should persevere to the end.",1397347200,,590,4.6826923076923075
4991779,5,B006IW8E3Y,"This tragi-comic movie tells the strory of a dusty, little small town in Lebanon whose Muslim and Christian neighbors are at peace, at a time when the rest of Lebanon is exploding into sectarian violence. The women in the town are weary of burying their sons, husbands and brothers, and will do anything to keep their men from fighting. Whether sabotaging the village TV, engaging a passing troupe of Russian belly dancers, or faking miracles and illnesses, the women go to extraordinary lengths to keep the chaos of war world at bay.

""Where Do We Go Now?"" is the cry of women against the unrelenting horror of war. It is smart, funny and doesn't try to gloss over the impact of grief and suffering. Also, there is music and dancing -- a few ensemble pieces that illuminate the women's shared burden.",1397174400,,801,4.680851063829787

4991781,5,B006IW8E3Y,"That is the dilemma of a small village made of almost equal parts of Muslims and Christians. As usual its the women who try to hold things to together.  I think Nadine Labaki has a unique directorial point of view and she is a fine actress. She is from that area and has a good feel for the dynamics that would actually occur in this hypothetical village.
I liked the movie because it had a nice interesting balance: some musical numbers (some dramatic, some humorous), humor, drama, and tragedy.

4991790,5,B006IW8E3Y,"Writtten, directed and starred in by a brilliant Lebanese woman, Nadine Labaki, this film takes on the absurdity of religious wars, in particular those between men who grew up friends in the same village.  With a nonprofessional cast Labaki brings off  a balance of tragi-comedy with amazing finesse.  Heartsick over the loss of sons and husbands, the Catholic and Muslim women of the village strategize a series of ruses to de-escalate the hostility among the volatile men, including hiring a troupe of Ukrainian belly dancers.

4991807,5,B006IW8E3Y,"Lebanese actress/writer/director/producer offers on of the most poignant statement about the struggle in the Middle East, a struggle between Christians and Muslims for power and dominance -a struggle that while real is the most preposterous argument tow `religions' based on love could have. Would that more people would watch this film there would probably be a better understanding of why the ongoing wars there are likely to never be settled.

The story as written by the gifted Nadine Labaki (who also stars and directs) is that of a little village in Lebanon that is half Christian and half Muslim: the church and the mosque stand side by side and the morning bells from the church play at the same time the Muezzin calls the Muslims to prayer, the cemetery is divided between the Muslim side and the Christian side, etc. The balance between the two factions is tenuous and the men are always looking for ways to start war among themselves. The women of the town try everything to ease the tension - create a caf&eacute;, import Ukrainian belly dancers to distract them, ply them with hashish-laden foods.  But when a stray bullet kills the male child of one of the mothers the division stops, the mother hides the slaughtered child, attempting to keep peace until silly arguments among the youths result in the discovery that the endless bilateral taunting has resulted in a tragedy. At the end of the film the narrator speaks: `My story is now ending for all those who were listening, of a town where peace was found while fighting continued all around. Of men who slept so deep and woke to find new peace. Of women still in black, who fought with flowers and prayers instead of guns and flares, and protect their children. Destiny then drove them to find a new way' - to which the pallbearers ask of the divided cemetery, `Where do we go now?'

Labaki understands the need for comic relief in a story of this nature and she provides that in some very warmly funny ways - the women walking along in groups sing and do a choreographic step that makes us smile.  But the power of the film is the message of compassion and the desperate need to re-think the omnipresent crises that tear the Middle East apart.  And it is quite proper to find similarities in every part of society.  Grady Harp, January 13",1357689600,5,2308,4.672413793103448

4991810,5,B006IW8E3Y,"To call this film brilliant would be a understatement. Most of the comments focus on the film per say. The message it conveys IS its brilliant accomplishment. Once the entertaining part wares off you are left with a almost subliminal (likely of political necessity) message. ""Where do we go now"" sums it up. Indeed the answer is deliberately non existent. It does bring to the foreground of the concept and the idiocy of 5000 plus years of mysticism, and as such, it could have not been more timely. The answer is that humanity desperately needs to grow UP from this mystic frame of mind. The combination of 21st. century military technology and the psychopathic religious AND political mentality presents a existential threat to humanity.
My research on the director (Nadine Labaki) was a delightful revelation of how much the world have changed. I visited Lebanon in the late 60, and it was then a peaceful but backward country. To see that the higher education system in this war thorn country can produce some one like Nadine Labaki was a pleasant surprise.

4991813,4,B006IW8E3Y,"In a small village in Lebanon, Christians and Muslims live peacefully side by side. They speak the same language, enjoy the same TV shows, they share broadly the same culture, only their religion divides them. However, peace is only apparent since violent conflict seems to arise within a hair's edge. It is up to the women of the village to try to pacify the men (sometimes with outlandish schemes) and quell any arguments which could degenerate into a war. In this obvious crowd pleaser, director Nadine Labaki (who also has a role as one of the Christian women in the village) tries to paint the village as a microcosm of Lebanon in the years after the long, brutal Lebanese civil war. If the film is to believed, the country is only in a weak truce before Christians and Muslims are at each other's throats again. I wasn't too impressed with director Labaki's previous film Caramel, but this one is pretty enjoyable. On the minus side, the humor is perhaps too broad at times.

4991815,4,B006IW8E3Y,"From Lebanese director Nadine Labaki (""Caramel"", ""Bosta"", ""The Smallest Red Carpet, But the Biggest Heart"") comes her whimsical comedy about women of a village wanting to make a difference when their husbands of Christian or Muslim faith are fighting with each other.

The film was inspired by Nadine's experience in Lebanon in war after two decades of peace and two opposing political parties moving towards war.  As an expecting mother, Nadine saw neighbors and friends turn to enemies because they belonged to opposing religious groups.  And so, she thought about her son and what kind of world he would see when he was born.  Would he be like everyone else who engaged in war?  As a mother, she thought about wanting to keep her son out of war and with the film, it developed from being one woman to a village of women who would do all they can to keep their son's from engaging in war.

The film premiered as part of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival's ""Un Certain Regard"" and won a ""Cadillac People's Choice Award"" at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Nadine Labaki takes one of the most complex situations that has affected various regions of the world for centuries and tries to find a silver lining through comedy and understanding.  But also with hope.

May it be in Lebanon or another country, there religious differences between Christians and Muslims are serious and what makes Labaki's film so fascinating is the fact that the village featured, is not affected by media, television, newspapers or Internet.

Sure, when they try to introduce television to the masses, surely things start to unravel.  There is a scene in which the village, which have co-existed and have remained peaceful, begin watching a newscast that details the ongoing fight between Christian and Muslims and it makes you wonder if that was the intention of Labaki.  To show that religious disagreements are possibly heightened by media.

But watching the film, we see how people do try to make an effort for peace, to not quickly blame the other religion for problems.  But when things get out of hand, the women take charge.  The film was also quite fascinating because it was born out of Nadine Labaki's experience in Lebanon and wondering how she can keep her son growing up in a world with hostilities.  Facing the absurdity of the conflicts and with her experience, it's an experience that other women share, not wanting their husbands and sons being killed in war.  So, the women decide to take action.

This is very intriguing because we often read in newspapers of how women do not have a voice in the Middle East.  Labaki's ""Where Do We Go Now?"" is a film that if the men are the cause of these religious disagreements and can not find peace with one another, perhaps the women of both religions can join forces and nullify these hostilities.

They try to find ways to do it in the film, granted the hiring of dancers and using sex as a way to calming people down can only go so far.  But there is a message in the film.  That women in leadership positions or women who can be empowered, can make a big difference.  The film is not about finding solutions as this turmoil has been ongoing for centuries, but what Labaki was able to create, was a film that although not seen as complete feminism, but belief and hope that women can and will make a difference, if they work together, rally together and believe that they can make a change.

As for the Blu-ray release, the cinematography is beautiful and the picture quality is fantastic.  Lossless audio is appropriate and you also get a good amount of special features included.

While the film has a good blend of comedy and even music-driven scenes, some may find the blend of comedy and melodrama to be a bit jarring.  Personally, not only do I see it as progressive, I see it as a film that possibly can inspire or add hope to many women.

But I do admit that the film is quite problematic when you try to balance comedy and melodrama.  With something as tense as Christian and Muslim relations, when people are killed, comedy is not a way to diffuse the situation.  But Labaki does try and accomplishes in sending out a message that women in various countries can possibly make a difference.",1354320000,3,5815,4.813319878910192
4991816,5,B006IW8E3Y,"This is a French made film that was originally released as `Et maintenant on va o? It is set in a remote Lebanese village. Christians and Muslims live side by side in an unsteady truce. The village lacks for most modern conveniences, such as television, or links with the outside.  So some of the enterprising young men rig up a satellite dish to try to be able to get a signal, of sorts. Then news of outside events start to filter in, and the villagers realise that religious war has broken out all around them. The women folk though have seen enough death through stupid intolerance and they decide that they have collectively had enough and decide to do what ever it takes to stop their men from fighting each other.

So they start by enlisting the help of both the Priest and the Imam in the on coming subterfuge. But then one act of sabotage set the men off on a tit for tat in fight that looks like snow balling out of control. The women will invent miracles, use drugs and even get the `ladies' from the gentleman's club, known as `The Paradise Palace' to entertain their men into not fighting, the question is, will it work?

This is an absolute gem of a film, it is a tragi- comedy as it is both heart breaking and sombre in places. The humour is never far from the surface though and makes this feel like a breath of fresh air. There is also a love interest between a Christian and Muslim that although it may look contrived as a message for unity, it is actually used more as a vehicle for showing why people sometimes fail to get on. It has good sub titles and is in Arabic, Russian and some English. There are only excellent performances here and a warmth that takes you in from the very start. It is a film I knew very little about, but is one that should have got a lot more attention.

It did what it set out to do-- it highlighted a real problem in today's Middle East (perhaps more so in Lebanon's diverse religious environment), but did so with overt humor, dark satire, and even a few musical numbers.  It was also done tastefully, and while shining light on the almost ridiculous nature of how this can all go down, it did not seek to alleviate the depth, harmfulness, and desperation of the situation.

It just as easily could have taken place in Israel (with mixed Jewish-Muslim groups), Iraq, Sudan, or any other place where religious identity can unite and/or divide.

The women come across as the heroines, while men are simple-minded and easy to manipulate. The conflict between the sexes makes for a lot of funny situations.

Not once but twice.  Now on DVD, this joint French-Lebanese production is visually and spiritually fantastic, beautiful, and prescient. Prescient because it predates yet forecasts the most recent bloodshed in this war-ravaged country.

 Through the microcosm of a small vibrant Lebanese village divided between Muslim and Christian believers, the film centers on the Muslim-Christian tensions within the country from the perspective of a klatch of beautiful, smart Lebanese women who are willing to stop at nothing to prevent their men from killing one another-- and they enlist the town imam and local priest to help them.  Their most clever ploy entails a set of role reversals--Christian women ""converting"" to Islam, and vice versa--to divert and re-educate their men.

 A tragic farce only in the sense that it exploits an improbable situation and spools from there,  it is at once comic at its best and unbearably sad to the point of tears. And it reaches beyond that. We in the West have stood by and watched the loss to us in just the past decade of  the four greatest Middle Eastern Civilizations-- Egypt, and now Syria,Iraq/Ancient Mesopotamia, and Iran/Persia-- among the greatest the world of recorded history has ever known, damaged to the point where they may never again recover, and surely to the point at which continuity with their past greatness has been broken.

4991828,5,B006IW8E3Y,"Where Do We Go Now is several things at once: a drama; a comedy; a musical of sorts; a slice of life in a troubled village and a commentary on life in general, at least in Lebanon and other countries nearby. It succeeds very well! True, once or twice things changed too quickly from drama to comedy or music; but this is a minor quibble. The plot moves along at a good pace and I was glued to the screen to see how everything would play out. The acting is superlative; although the actors are not highly seasoned professionals they give nuanced, convincing and passionate performances. The choreography and the cinematography work well and the musical score enhances the film, too.

When the action starts, we meet quite a few people in a Lebanese village isolated because the only bridge to it is badly damaged and needs repair; traveling too far from the village is also dangerous because of land mines. The villagers are hemmed in. Fortunately, there is peace between the Christian and Muslim members of the community; their houses of worship are almost side by side--there's just one house between the mosque and the church. People are also very excited that a few teenagers found a way to hook up a television; now they can watch programs including the news.

It isn't long, however, before pent up tensions begin to surface. At first it's just a comment here and there; but things deteriorate. Once the villagers see on television is that there is fighting on the outside between Muslims and Christians, the Muslim and Christian men in the village begin to fight and the women oppose the violence. Things begin to spiral out of control after Muslims suspect that Christians put goats in their Mosque and stole their shoes while they were praying inside the mosque; and Christians are appalled and angered when  a Muslim man smashes their statue of the Virgin Mary and they discover chicken blood in the font to mock their Communion.

The religious leaders want peace but it is the women who really struggle to make it happen. The women hire Ukrainian belly dancers to distract the men and put hashish in baked goods to make the men mellow! There's more, too, including a huge plot twist at the end of the film that left quite an impression on me.

Look for superb performances by director Nadine Labaki who plays Amale, a Christian woman in love with Muslim Rabih (Julian Farhat); Kevin Abboud as Nassim; Petra Saghbini as Rita; Caroline Labaki as Ada; Yvonne Maalouf as Yvonne; Claude Baz Moussawbaa as Takla; Ali Haidar as Roukoz; Oxana Chihane as Katia and Leyla Hakim as Afaf. As I mentioned above, the others give wonderful performances, too.

Where Do We Go Now is a poignant look at life in a troubled Lebanese village and how it can be so hard to achieve peace between warring groups, in this case Christians and Muslims. I highly recommend this film for people who like drama with cultural, social and political themes with a side dish of comedy and even some music to lighten things up.

Movie Review
1: What is the new concept that was introduced to you that you were not aware of before watching the movies?
A new concept that was introduced to me from the movie was the idea of an Arab country like Lebanon being almost 50% Christian and the other half Muslim. It was interesting to see how a small village could be so affected by the differences in religion. When I think of how affected the village was, it makes me wonder how affected is the rest of the country? I understand this film is set around a war between religions, but to what extent do people take this war in other parts of the country? And it also made me wonder, how do other groups, such as the group of women in the village, effect the outcome of war? Are there more groups trying to mend the differences between people? Or do most groups believe in the superiority of their own religion versus that of the other?
2: What is the thing that intrigued you/ entertained you and/or surprised you the most in general? Give examples.
What surprised me the most was to see the willingness the women had to work together to build a better community for everyone. When comparing this film to other films Ive seen about Arab women, they are also portrayed as defenseless or under control of the men. It was actually refreshing to see the role shifts here. Instead of the women being controlled by the men, the men are actually being manipulated by the women. Having little/to no knowledge of the daily lives of Arab villagers, I wonder how true this portrayal is? Im sure there are organized groups dedicated to form bonds between people. But how many of those people are women? How do they aid in helping to relieve tensions? And how are the received by the people whom they work with?
 3; What would you hope to have seen differently in the movie to improve your experience.
Growing up in a western civilization, Ive grown accustomed to the idea of women having a more up-front role in different situations. Of course, not all roles played by women in a western film capture the idea of women independence, but they do manage to show how the woman/women had more control of the situation they were in. In this film, the women had to work in the background to plan what they were going to do to get the men in the village to come together. Though their plan is brilliant, I would have liked to see a more upfront knowledge that the women are in charge of the situation and that it was more obvious.
 But, I do have to admit, I liked how the film showed the separation of men and women. You were really able to see how the women were able to plan specific tricks to get their point across without having to take individual responsibility for their actions. It was more of a we are a group and we will stay a group no matter what versus an all for their own mentality.

This movie appeared to be a mix of comedy, drama and at times almost seemed like a musical as well. The comedy was interesting, including the ideas of making foods with drugs to keep men from wanting to fight, but had an underlying tone that was serious. Namely, that in such a small place it is so ludicrous to keep having warring factions based solely on religious beliefs that some would think of trying anything, no matter how obscene, to stop them.

I thought there were two other considerations this movie raised. First, that a small area that perpetually fights each other ultimately will wipe itself out. The fighting destroys what they are trying to preserve.

Second, it raises a gender question- is it the men that are always wanting to fight, and if so, perhaps they would all be better off if the women were making the important decisions. That's a pretty daring suggestion, however subtle, given the Islamic culture prevalent in the region, but it does bring to light that there is an associated tendency  of predominantly male, religiously-motivated factions that tend to destroy one another.
Perhaps it is long overdue to let the women decide ;)

What is the new concept that was introduced to you , that you were not aware of before
watching the movie?
One new concept that immediately struck me was the relationship dynamics between
the woman and the village and the men in the village. I have noticed that the separation
between men and women in general has a profound effect on relationships in these
societies. It was interesting how the older women in the village constantly look out for
and defend the younger and more vulnerable women in the group. Furthermore, the
conflict between Muslims and Christians in the village was completely resulted from
outside information which was uninterpreted. It goes to show how important of a role
media is in the lives of rural populations in the Middle East.
What is the thing that intrigued you/ entertained you and/or surprised you the most in
general? Give examples.
I thought it was hilarious how the only thing that forced the men in the village to
cooperate was the introduction of Ukrainian prostitutes. It really goes to show how
superficial some conflicts really are. The conflicts in the village between Muslims and
Christians did not posses any true merit, but was rather a result of tony skirmishes.
Also, the acting was superb and I thought the music really complimented the scenes
very well. The film was very unique and extremely artistic. Overall I think this film
intended to represent Lebanese society as a whole, rather than a small village with
superficial problems.
What would you hope to have seen differently in the movie to improve your experience?
I very much enjoyed this film and thought it was a very unique perspective regarding the
gender politics within Lebanese society, but I would very much prefer much more
organized storytelling. At time is found myself wondering where the scene was going
because it felt as though it was randomly shot. Overall it was a fantastic film, but greater
organization would have gone a long way.

Movie Review Assignment

Since I grew up in Kuwait, most of the concepts presented in the film Where Do We Go Now, were familiar to me. However, I did not know that in Lebanon they have/had coexisting religions in the same village. Currently, in Kuwait we have mosques and churches, but the relationship between the individuals who have different religion does not seem as strong as presented in the film. Thus, having such a strong relationship between individuals was the most surprising thing to me. There is no doubt that anyones ultimate goal is to live peacefully, so it was interesting to see the females of the village getting together and planning to find suitable solutions to solve any problem that might occur. For example, they buried the hidden guns somewhere else to avoid having another murder (other than the one that happened away from the village). Personally, I liked the movie, but I hoped that the love story presented would have ended with marriage at the end. Because this would assure the audience that coexistence and living peacefully can actually happen regardless of the differences.

I thought this movie was very funny. I wasn't expecting it to be funny for someone like me, who can't relate very heavily to this film. I wasn't familiar with the fact that weed was so accessible, and openly used in the Middle East. I really loved the concept of the women in the village sticking together when the men were fighting and trying to separate the religions. The part that was the most entertaining for me was towards the very end when the women pretended to switch religions, so their husbands and sons would finally stop with the unnecessary fighting. The only thing in the movie that I thought it could have been fine without was the romantic subplot between Amale and Rabih. It didn't have any relevance in the plot of the movie and didn't resolve at the end. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would, and would defiantly watch it again.
Take the finest Hash
Worth its weight in gold
Yellow or Brown, it makes no difference
Add some more, don't be shy
The Hashish comes from my heart
  ----- Excerpt from the greatest impromptu plot-deviation musical number in the history of film.

In a persons life, they may have a cinematic experience that completely changes their life. A movie so powerful, so raw, so honest that the annals of moviemaking are opened immediately for its lifetime preservation.

Where do We Go Now? Is NOT that movie. But you know what. Its not a bad one either!

Where Do We Go Now? Is set in a Lebanese village which is primarily cut off from the rest of the region by a field of landmines. One small bridge serves as the only contact with the outside world. In this village, a tight-knit community of Muslims and Christians have lived together peacefully for years. However, unknown forces pull the village into strife, pitting neighbor against neighbor. It is up to the Mayors wife, Yvonne, and her cohort of respected ladies in the village, to keep the men from killing each other. They also make hash brownies.

The first time I attempted to make hash brownies, I completely forgot about the importance of ensuring you have a well-choreographed musical number to perform during their preparation. While I am not as crass to assume that all Lebanese ladies burst into song and dance while making marijuana edibles, I certainly have never had the foresight to do the same. As such, my hash brownies did not turn out nearly as kind as the ladies of the village make them. To prove my point, their husbands end up getting so high that they completely forgot why they were fighting each other. Which brings us to the moral of the story: Marijuana can end war!

This movie is rife with comedy, tragedy, violence, love, forgiveness, and even redemption. It tells a story and teaches a lesson that moves the viewer into a sense of empathy, coupled with the emotional raw power of what could be construed as one of the funniest sad movies Ive ever seen, or one of the saddest funny movies Ive ever seen. Either way, the  character of the village mayor looks very much like Danny Devito, an observation I happened across after smoking what some might consider a to be a heroic amount of cannabis.

But the most intriguing thing to a viewer that is only vaguely familiar with middle eastern culture would be the fact that as tough and as macho as these guys want to be, these sisters run the friggin town, best believe dat! As an example of their political savvy, at one point In the plotline, this seemingly innocuous band of sweet little old ladies hire what seems to bewellhookers. Why they do this, I have no idea. But it was certainly funnier than anything Ben Stiller ever did. As such, the men of the village are temporarily distracted by bountiful Ukrainian cleavage and the perverse thoughts that come with it as they regress back into adolescence, leaving the women of the village to further their plans.
In summation, Where Do we Go Now? is a lighthearted romp mixed with gut-wrenching tragedy that serves to entertain even the most skeptical of undergraduate Beginning Arabic II students at the University of Colorado Denver. A movie well worth your time, especially if watching it saves you from taking what could have been a very painful exam but you have a super-awesome professor that knows you need a nice bump in your grade so you do the review and try to make it funny because the movie was actually really, really, funny and I literally played the hash brownies song over and over again because its the best thing Ive heard all day.

Final Rating: 7/10. It may not be Along the Waterfront, but if youve watched everything on your Netflix queue and your girlfriend wants to watch something that doesnt involve explosions and fart jokes, Where Do We Go Now? is certainly worth a rental.
