2438436,5,B000BRBA92,"Much like all of his movies,Lord Steven is retired/ undercover/ in hiding/ incognito/ or part of the CIA/ FBI/ Black Ops/ Special undercover group of your choice...

He must personally save the world and his partner/ student from the bad guys that are dealing in Nukes.

If this sounds derrogatory towards the movie it is not! I am a huge Seagal fan and own every movie he has released, I think the production and storyline of Black Dawn is more the caliber of his earlier movies and I quite enjoyed it. I am glad to see he is putting out a better product! But it would not matter because like all TRUE Seagal fans if he is in the movie, I will buy it no matter how bad. I would just like to see his movies return to the big screen where he belongs. If you are a fan buy this you will love it. If you are not a fan buy it anyway as it is a good movie and the plot/ story is good enough that the common action hero movie buffs will like it.",1138665600,11,939,4.016042780748663

2438438,2,B000BRBA92,"Welcome to another movie documenting the slow decline of my hero. Watching Steve fall apart from movie to movie is making my own aging easier. I mean if the Steve can age and get fat, I feel better about me getting fat and old. In this movie, his ""not even close"" stuntman works hard although there are no real martial arts anyway. It's a ""run and gun"" and Steve left his running shoes in other movies. I think I enjoy paying for his retirement by buying these ""straight to DVD"" release wonders. I am going to his website to buy some almond oil in a few minutes.",1138320000,,562,4.261682242990654
2438439,4,B000BRBA92,"If you are a fan of Seagal's, I think you will like this movie. If not, then it is a somewhat generic action film, although still much better than any of the direct to TV movies you will find coming out on, say, the SciFi channel. As many folks have mentioned, his recent stuff has been hit or miss, but if you keep coming back to watch the next one, why are you complaining? This one had a decent, straight forward plot. Not a lot in the way of fighting sequences, but the man is 50 something years old now. You tended to know what was coming, but then you don't watch Steven Seagal for trendy plot twists. The movie's pace was good and I did not hear any dubbing of Steven's lines, a major plus compared to some of his recent stuff. Many folks will find it another plus that Steven does not play a hip, street wise, down with the homies character. Personally that never really bothered me, although it was bit harder to believe. Instead he goes back to his earlier characters and plays an ex-CIA operative.",1135814400,3,1008,4.310526315789474
2438440,1,B000BRBA92,"with 99$ of the fighting scenes done by other stuntmen, and it looked so obviously not he himself doing anything but showed you a fat walking stiff, there's nothing worth watching in this brain-dead  movie. 4 minutes to go up from the elevator to the roof, got into the chopper, still got time to talk with the stupid female agent, another couple of minutes flying out to sea, dropped the suitcase a-bomb with only 32 seconds left, then kept flying out with big orange mushroom behind. no electronic storm, radiation whatsoever,  the chopper still could fly and fly.....what the hell?! then that's  not done yet, got to put the fat seagal and the female agent in some unknown resort for 3 days , then finally, the fat guy walked away (the first time in real person instead of a stuntman) what the???? copying 007 crap? after every mission accomplished, got to have the woman be with him to chow some good food or love making? give me a break! what?

2438441,4,B000BRBA92,"Seagal (Jonathan Cold) is trying to stop Chechen terrorists from deploying a plutonium bomb in the US.  In the beginning it's unclear who's on whose team, and there were several scenes with forced suspense that didn't quite feel as tense as it was obviously planned for, but overall this movie is better than some of the latest Seagal flicks.

I'd recommend it for the die-hard fans, although do not expect to see him fighting.  He breaks a hand, shoots a few people, and drives like a maniac, but other than that there is no hand-to-hand combat (that Seagal engages in.  The other actors did fight, though--if that's a consolation).  Overall, a nice movie.  Definitely not a blockbuster, but also not a one star by any means.",1135555200,3,726,4.722222222222222

Before I get into my review I'm going to talk about the cover of the film, notice those two guys fighting? Well they never ever appear in the film. Some guy thought it would be a good idea to put a couple of people fighting because it might sell some more copies.

And can someone tell me why they chose to make a sequel to one of his worse and most hated films.

There are close to no fight scenes in this movie and when Seagal is supposed to fight it's just his stunt man. The film is full of bad acting, dubbing, stunt men and stock footage. The story is lame, a poor excuse at trying to make a suspenseful movie. Don't buy this movie, save your money. 0/5",1135209600,5,738,4.082758620689655

2438446,3,B000BRBA92,"Black Dawn, 2005 film

Two men sit on a park bench and talk; it is winter. There is a shot, one man is dead! The next scene is at the Amsterdam Financial District. A woman approaches an armored car, then shoots two guards and steals a metal suitcase. She gets into a car and they drive away, the other guards shoot at them. In Utah a group stop a man and use his photo ID to enter a prison and treat a prisoner. He is taken away for emergency treatment in an ambulance! But this is a ruse to allow his escape. Jonathan Cold is a free-lance agent. The Amsterdam robbery was blamed on terrorists who want to raise money from stolen diamonds. People are watching this. Robbers invade a jewelry store and kill the guards! This group plans to acquire a plutonium bomb. We see their character. Other men join them for a meeting. They check this suitcase bomb.

Elsewhere there is another killing. Then a woman is found! Will she talk? There is a surprise and a lot of shooting. Cold and this woman make a daring escape from a window. There is a car chase and more shooting. There is a car crash and more shooting, then a fiery car crash! Enjoy the ride? They acquire another car. Cold sort of explains his mission. They return to that factory. You may not be safe. Then two men enter and start shooting. [Nobody ever runs out of bullets.] Cold drives away. Note how an item is smuggled out of that factory. Mr. Brown makes a delivery. The terrorists inspect that suitcase bomb. Who is planning a double-cross? Cold asks a computer hacker to investigate Greer. That woman breaks down a door, there is a struggle then a gun shot. All those names say a hit team is being assembled. Get out of LA immediately!

Cold enters a house without using a key, then dials a number. McCabes house is searched by that woman. She finds a hiding place. But others arrive at that hotel but don't find that package. A door is broken open, there is more shooting. Then more shooting! And more shooting! But one gets away with the package. Where would they explode a bomb to create the maximum damage? We did it says one terrorist. But there is another surprise! Something goes wrong. Cold has a plan to dispose of the bomb. A helicopter takes off in the rain and flies over Los Angeles out to sea. The suitcase is thrown into the sea. Can they get away safely? Yes, they late dine out. Just doing my job. She will be rewarded.

This is a very fast-paced action movie. There are no slow spots where you can question the plausibility of some scenes. No radiation detector at that factory? Seagal has put on too much weight from his earlier days. The long shots suggest stunt doubles. This is a warning against terrorists who would explode an atomic bomb in a big city. But wouldnt a biological weapon be easier to obtain and disseminate in a large city? Note the automobiles for product placement, and how some pistols fire without a muzzle flashes. Sound effects are cheaper and safer than real cartridges. Could there be a betrayal by government agents? Yes, but I thing its improbable (in this case).",1424476800,,3075,4.4564831261101245

2438457,3,B000BRBA92,"This film actually reminded me quite a bit of Shadow Man (2006) though this film being released in 2005 predates that movie. Both films have kind of an eastern European, dark & shadowy espionage-quality to them and despite being fairly-well directed movies are rather slow & methodical without much action to them. However, there wasn't any obvious voice-dubbing in this flick as there was in Submerged (2005) or Attack Force (2006). But there was quite a bit of use of a stunt double and it was obvious at times though it didn't really detract from the movie too much. There was one scene in particular though that I noticed towards the end of the film where Seagal's stunt double is fighting some bad guys in a stairwell and the stunt double is wearing a light grey suit, but in the scene prior to it and following it Seagal's character is wearing a dark blue suit. That was pretty bad!

Unfortunately not much Aikido showcases in this movie, other than the work by the stunt double in a couple of scenes, you don't really see Seagal do much of anything other than shootouts and car chases. More and more of his more recent films are going this direction I've noticed. Less of the martial arts and more of the shootouts and car chases - disappointing. However, not a bad film overall, just a little slow and methodical for my taste.",1253404800,,1334,4.581589958158996
2438458,3,B000BRBA92,"Black Dawn is another direct to video release from Steven Seagal, which features the action star returning as Jonathan Cold, a deep cover agent involved with criminals, and an Eastern Block terrorist group seeking to construct and employ a nuclear device.  While the terrorists commit a number of brutal robberies to raise the capital to fund their scheme, Cold teams with CIA agent Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies), a former associate to try and stop them.

There's a high level of violence, and some good action sequences, and plenty of gunfire, explosions, and chase or two.  Seagal breaks one wrist, but doesn't do much actual hand to hand combat.  Those days are probably gone.  For Seagal's fights, some funky editing is used at times, to give the appearance of battle, or perhaps it is ballet?  Still, the plot holds together better than one might expect, unlike the first Jonathan Cold adventure, The Foreigner, which was rather a disjointed effort.  Although the final action sequence involving a helicopter is a little weak, among Seagal's recent films, this is one of his better efforts.",1242777600,,1095,5.016574585635359
2438459,2,B000BRBA92,"Black Dawn is one of the very bad films in Seagal's direct-to-DVD era. It's a sequel to the equally horrible The Foreigner (also a 2-Star Film). As with other bad Seagal films the storyline is very difficult to follow. Making the film even more difficult to follow is the terrible sound quality. I gave up watching Black Dawn 40 minutes into the film. Unless you're a big Seagal fan, I would recommend skipping this film and going for some of his earlier works or even some of the more recent DTV works which are of much better quality. If you've really got to watch this one, rent it or buy it used on Amazon.",1224979200,,610,4.359649122807017
2438460,2,B000BRBA92,"Black Dawn was made in 2005. For those of Sid's readers who are not Segal historians, this was right in the middle of his one foot off the cliff stage in his career. Meaning, he was on a self-destructive path that miraculously ended in Segal becoming the king of straight to DVD action rather than killing himself. The movies he did during this period were attrocious at best. He must have realized how horrific he looked on camera at this point because it was here that he started producing as well as staring in these flicks. Thankfully, Segal threw in the towel on looking presentable in his films, gained an extra 50 pounds(for a total gain of 195 since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>), grew out the Myers hair more, and gave us a classic in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pistol-Whipped/dp/B0011VIO4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pistol Whipped</a>&nbsp;hopefully with more to come.

 The tagline for Black Dawn is ""It's always darkest before dawn."" Sid's theory on this is that it had nothing to do with the movie. No, it must have symbolized a sad night when Segal arrived at his local Wendy's just after it closed. He probably got a Santa-like far away look in his eyes and contimplated life, arriving at the conclusion that he couldn't get his usual 80 nuggets and life just isn't fair. If Sid was forced to come up with a tagline for Black Dawn, it would either be ""Steven Segal or the former Duran Duran rodie: Which guy's got it?"" or maybe ""Don't waste your time."" This film was awful, and that's saying something considering Sid's love for Segal.

 The movie started out well enough. Segal plays Jonathan Cold(awesome name) again. Aparently, this is a character from another Segal masterpiece. It had Segal as a rouge ex-CIA agent like he always is now in his movies. Except, after that it kind of got blurry. Sid remenbers a few former Duran Duran rodies, or maybe they were former Depeche Mode rodies. Either way. And there was an appearance by McGyver's Richard Dean Anderson's brother Richard Dean Anderson. There was also a terrible scene when Segal and the B Nicole Kidman were driving. It looked just like when people drove in movies in the 50's. You know, there was an obvious seperation between the background and the actors. Does this mean that there have been no technological advances in movies in 50 plus years? No, sadly it just means that 90% of the film's budget was wasted on Segal's dressing room Arby's spread, his robes, and massage oils. And believe us, the film suffered. What about the part at the end when Segal was throwing the Depeche Mode rodies' bomb into the water? It looked like plastic. The effects in this movie just could not have been worse. It even got to the point where Sid got tired of making of Segal. Well, except for his awful suit. It was an old-school brown pinstripe 56 long and portly at the same time with a crappy off-white shirt and an even crappier yellow tie. And it looked worse than it sounds. It was designed by the famous Burlington designer Knights of the Round Table. And it was topped off by a pair of Honchos. That was wonderful, the highlight of the movie.

 Well, you know a movie is terrible when the highlight was Segal's $45 ensamble. It was that rare kind of film that was only 90 minutes long but it seemed to last forever. That's not a good thing. Segal, of course, has since made a major resurgence. But, this film might have been Segal's worst effort. He had only the begining stages of his now famous Myers hair and panda bear face. And he didn't even talk like he was an aging dude from the hood. You still couldn't understand what he was saying, but there wasn't a hint of ghetto slang. Very disappointing. In fact, in keeping the old Sid tradition, let's give this one a new title. Instead of Black Dawn, it's now Brown Pile.",1216166400,,3974,4.888724035608309
2438461,2,B000BRBA92,"After spending some time watching Dolph Lundgren movies and Jean-Claude Van Damme titles, it was nice returning to a Steven Seagal film - ""nice"" meaning, I could pop the ""Black Dawn"" DVD into my player and enjoy the film whilst dividing my attention with ironing laundry, because there's little chance that Steven was going to do or say anything to surprise me. Fans of his have generally accepted this, since the man has proven himself a guy of repetitious plots and characters. However, it wasn't before long I looked up from my towels to become aware of a couple of things regarding the movie: first of all, it's one of Seagal's prettiest DTV releases I've ever seen, and secondly, there's almost nothing going on in it.

In a sequel to Seagal's maligned DTV-emerging flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>&nbsp;(proving that it's possible to expand the franchise of absolutely anything, no matter how bad it starts), he returns as ex-CIA mercenary Jonathan Cold, who is hired by British arms-dealers to help sell parts of a nuclear bomb to a group of Chechen terrorist-martyrs planning to blow up Los Angeles. But after plans go awry and CIA agent/former protg Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scorcher/dp/B00009OOFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scorcher</a>) gets involved, Seagal must both flee assassination and stop the plot to destroy L.A.

As said before, ""Black Dawn"" actually looks very good: award-winning lifetime cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>) directs the movie with a decent flair for lighting and camera angles, so (with the exception of a couple of atrocious CGI-involving shots) the film manages to look like more than an $8 million production. Also in its favour is the cast, which is one of the better assemblies to be seen in a Seagal film: Tamara Davies and baddies John Pyper-Ferguson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive/dp/B0000ZG040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive</a>), Julian Stone (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loser/dp/B00003CXK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loser</a>), and Nicholas Davidoff play their roles convincingly, and the rest of the cast is clearly making an effort as well.

I just wish that at some point, somebody had gone up to either Seagal or the director and reminded them that they were, in fact, supposed to be making an action movie. Much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot/dp/6305428158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot</a>, ""Black Dawn"" offers little satisfaction for action-lovers. The cover of the movie is deceiving: next to no martial arts are displayed (and when the single scene does come, it features the worst-disguised body double Steven's ever had), and about two of the three gunfights featured last less than thirty seconds. A decent car chase involving a big rig is the adrenaline highlight, but without any other intriguing life-ending antics, this otherwise-pretty film feels inexcusably bare for a Seagal-starring feature. The plot lacks the intensity to qualify as a thriller and therefore, the movie is left both pretty and useless; no wonder writer Martin Wheeler has had trouble finding work.

This non-action aspect slays the film as a whole: a Steven Seagal movie without action is like a hamburger without the beef pattie, and no amount of decent acting or cinematography can make up for it in the end. In this sense, ""Black Dawn"" is the most disappointing of Seagal's recent offerings, because it had so many things going for it that his other flicks didn't, but these were apparently traded for Seagal's bread-and-butter, leaving this otherwise-promising flick duly emaciated. For devoted fans, only.",1213488000,,4046,6.245519713261649

2438465,2,B000BRBA92,"The Great One (who is also a producer here) takes up one of his worst films, namely sleep-inducing `The Foreigner,' and he does the same role that nobody seems to remember. One good news is that the sequel turns out more decent than the original, but that isn't saying much.

In `Black Dawn' Steven Seagal plays Jonathan Cold again, who is at first seen helping the brother of one bad arms dealer break out of jail, apparently working for the bad guys. Well, perhaps he should have, for in that case things might have been more interesting than this dull B action film.

Besides the obvious stunt doubles, the inept editing, and the chubby face of the star who seems to prefer to stay out of the `action scenes,' you will see CIA agent played by Tamara Davies, also former protg of Cold. There is one so-so action involving a runaway garbage truck and some OK shoot-outs, but their terrible acting which occupies most of the second half of the film makes everything dull in the end. The idea of Chechen terrorists or nuke attack are reduced to nothing because of the hulk of the star who seems not to care.

What you see `in Black Dawn' is your former aikido sensei getting lazy in his work. That's a sad thing to see.",1150934400,8,1218,4.452914798206278

Seagal plays Jonathan Cold (thank God they didn't call him Jonathan Hott!), an agent for some deep dark secret covert organization with ""four columns""?  Tamara Davies is the requisite hottie agent who wonders what Seagal's up to and carries on like most female agents in these Romanian movies--makes one dumb move after another.  The storyline (ho hum) centers on terrorists out to set off a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles.  Seagal is hardly seen during any of his few hand to hand combats, pretty much confirming that the beefy actor's stuntman did all the work, of which there is very little.  A preposterous chase scene in a garbage truck is reminiscent of Roadrunner cartoons in its lunacy.  Two stars for the hammy but effective performance from John Pyper Ferguson as the villain.

This time his mission is to thwart a cell of Chechen terrorists scheming to detonate a nuke in Los Angeles.  The story concept promises excitement but fails to deliver.  Maybe Mr. Seagal believes he's getting ""too old"" for martial arts movies, or maybe he's decided to redirect his genre from action to suspense.  Because, while Agent Cold is apparently not ""too old"" for his young female partner, the film is disappointingly short on action.  Specifically, the trademark Aikido fighting moves that made Seagal famous.  Cold defeats the Chechens with brainpower and firepower; not a bad thing, just not what this viewer was expecting.  The interesting and somewhat convoluted plot can't really carry the film for fans of Seagal's former martial arts mayhem.",1148774400,5,849,5.198529411764706

He is a bit old and a tad bit more out of shape weight wise.  Sorry i'm a fan but even i know when to throw in the towel...DING...throw it in please.",1146182400,,472,4.032258064516129
2438469,2,B000BRBA92,"It's a watch-able Seagal outing but ultimately very forgettable and verges on being boring. Today You Die even with all its problems and stock footage ripped from other movies has the edge on Black Dawn. The much talked about chase scene is boring, cheap looking and makes use of very obvious green screen effects when Seagal is on the top of the Dump Truck. Seagal looks bored, the script has nothing to give Seagal a chance to deliver lines the fans want to hear, he has no fight scenes and for some reason the producers decided to insert a stunt double that looked absolutely nothing like Seagal in any way near the end for no reason I could see and made me cringe when I saw it. The stunt double is not even wearing the same coloured suit as Seagal. For Seagal fans it's worth a rental then forget about it and move on to Mercenary For Justice which sounds very promising. For non Seagal fans, it's probably not worth even renting.",1145923200,,935,4.441860465116279
2438470,1,B000BRBA92,"It was painful to watch this one. The day that stunt doubles start doing your trademark fighting scenes, it's time to hang it up. I love his early movies. Seagal looked bloated and uncomfortable. Everything, including the opening credits, looked cheap, rushed and disjointed. The transition between scenes was rough and choppy. The only star in this one was the computer geek whose brief appearance was actually funny. Can't recommend it, sorry.",1143849600,3,445,5.194444444444445
2438471,1,B000BRBA92,"I thought when I saw Steven Seagal in the movie, ""how could you go wrong getting this?""  After seeing just 30 minutes of it, I knew how wrong it could go.  This is at best a B movie.",1142294400,3,182,3.763157894736842
2438472,1,B000BRBA92,"Of course only fans would get this movie.

Steven looks fat, old, and tired -- even to fans who were hoping for a little escapism.
