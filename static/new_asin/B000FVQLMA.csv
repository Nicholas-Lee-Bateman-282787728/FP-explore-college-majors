8127349,4,B000FVQLMA,"Gypsy Vampire is a fun no-budget vampire video by former Ed Wood stock player Conrad Brooks. Bad acting, goofy dialog and cheap special effects prove you don`t have to have a ""budget"" to have fun making a good horror movie. Avenger Vs the Terror Robot is a cool throwback to those sci fi thrillers of the 50`s and 60`s.",1306886400,,319,4.423728813559322
8127350,4,B000FVQLMA,"Being a bit partial to this movie due to the fact that I had a hand in making it. I'd have to say that this is one of Conrad Brooks better movie's to date. Albeit, it still has all the drudgery of a horrible B-movie. New comers to the Conrad Movie Company give there best but still lack the finer points of acting skill to rate it anything higher than a B-movie. Horrible/great sets (or I should say, non-existent sets) shown through-out have a haunted house feeling to them while still showing that it was a bad set-up to begin with. Now, I have only seen the original un-edited edition, but I have heard wonders about the special effects they have added. I hope this has help in your decision to buy this movie.",1152748800,,713,4.3283582089552235
