8094916,3,B000BZITBG,"This work focused on Ravel's influences and collaborations.  It does not provide much coverage about how he produced works and why he chose A and B elements over C and D when composing.  I usually equate Basque people with Spain, but Ravel was a French citizen who was half Basque.  They say he was short; he could be added with Prince, Napoleon, Santos-Dumas, and other famous short men.  Though the work says he has detractors, there's still a way in which it implies that he was instantly and always praised.  The narrator says, ""Ravel was never known to have a lover of either sex, but he had an intense dynamic with M. Fargue.""  I really think this was the program's way of diplomatically saying, ""We can't prove it, but if we were betting men we'd say Ravel was gay.""  The work has much writing on the screen, I am not sure why they didn't trust viewers to understand the narrator who spoke clearly.  This is a British production and thus uses British spellings and contractions.",1182643200,2,985,4.588571428571429
