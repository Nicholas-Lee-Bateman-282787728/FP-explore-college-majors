3448952,5,B001AI7766,"Parents, definitely check out the whole Avatar series for a unique type of anime that's enjoyable for all ages. Filled with action, comedy, etc. Avatar is a series that families can watch together to enjoy some bonding time on rainy days. Granted Eastern religious concepts are prevalent throughout the story, but that's easily managed as this is just a cartoon and can be explained as fictitious from A to Z. Still, there are excellent values being taught throughout the series that will have parents smiling.",1215216000,6,510,5.011764705882353
3448953,5,B001AI7766,"I have to write something about this wonderful series, but I'm not going to write any spoilers, or tell you what happens. I know many of you have never watched any of the episodes, and don't want to know what happens, and those who have watched it do not care if I leave it out.

What I can say, though, is that this is one amazing show; as an overview for those who have no idea what the storyline is, just picture a messiah-type that has to rescue the world from being enslaved by an evil empire. The messiah (avatar) is what you would view as an underdog against unspeakable odds, but with incredible potential that flashes through occasionally. You may see similarities to such works as The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter, or the Inheritance Cycle. They all have that common theme of an underdog destined or prophesied to set the captives free and defeat the evil empire. Avatar may be a little more like Star Wars than the others, as it has a definite Eastern mysticism element to it, and martial arts moves are a major portion of the action sequences.

One of my favorite parts of every episode is the comic relief: Sokka. Sure, all of the characters have comical incidents, but Sokka is without a doubt the character intended to bear the burden of comic relief, and he carries it off well. Yet, he is also the main one with the ideas.

With Book 3 and the entire series complete this year, I can say it progressively got better and more intense with each season. The character development is detailed and satisfying. This is one set to buy (after the other two sets, that is). It is sad that this is the last season, but there are intentions for a new Avatar series in the future, possibly with a different incarnation of the Avatar. The creators are said to have intended The Last Airbender as a three season arc, a sort of trilogy.

You may think it is really for kids, being animated and on Nickelodeon, but my wife and I, with two small children, are into it just as much as the kids are. If you have never tried watching it, I suggest you rent it from Netflix or Blockbuster to get a sampling of the quality of the show. It is best to start at the beginning, though, because it is a story extended over three seasons, and makes more sense if you watch in order. The only show on television that gets my attention more than this is Battlestar Galactica, which is also ending soon.

I was most pleased when I found out there will be a live action movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan based on Book 1, simply called The Last Airbender (to avoid confusion with a movie called Avatar by James Cameron coming out in 2009 - not related to the series), which should be out in July 2010. He intends to direct a trilogy based on the three seasons, separated by two years each, spending six years of his life on this storyline. That should say something about the series, as it is the first thing he has worked on that was not something he came up with himself.

EDIT: After viewing the live action movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I was most displeased. Apparently, he cannot adequately adapt this story or the characters to film, mangling personalities as well as name pronunciations. Stick with the animated series.",1214870400,5,3236,4.448566610455312

3448971,5,B001AI7766,"Dear Amazon,
Who the hell do you think you are. You are MAKING me PAY to watch my favorite kids show as a 20 year old man! This is a crime against all of humanity and needs to be dealt with in the highest degree of consequences. Avatar brought me happiness and joy when I was upset whenever my mother took away my video games. I was halfway through season two when you decided to crush my soul with this horrendous decision. I now will never again be able to relive the last, and in my opinion, the best season. I cannot feel all of those emotions I felt oh so long ago. Fix this please, as a fan of the series, do not punish me for wanting to experience my childhood all over again.
Signed,
A fan who cares",1505260800,16,707,4.057142857142857

Watching it as a man closing in his mid twenties really made me see a lot of the deeper meanings laid out in the show. Truly Avatar has achieved a combo that's really not easy to accomplish, and that is making a awesome kid's show into something that even adults can learn from plus enjoy. If anyone wants to give this is a shot I truly want to vouch for it, and if you think this is just another kid's show, well I still wish you give it a shot.

This is a show worth the watch (all three seasons not just season 3... wish Prime would allow us to rate the series instead of the season...) If you have ever liked an anime this is worth the watch, because it is really good, it isn't dark... at times it can be twisted (like once in the entire series) the comedic value of the show is great IMO, but I find the terrible jokes hilarious, mostly because of how terrible they are, which I think was the point.

We re-watch the series about once a year, and find new depth, joy, and meaning each time. It is a beautiful fusion of so many spiritual teachings, but without the dogma.

Avatar the last airbender in my opinion was much better than legend of Korra however I loved that tv series too. Avatar had romance action comedy and drama. I wish that Ang,Katara,Sokka,Zerco, and most of all toph were still there same age and the characters of the leagued of Korra were added in when legend of Korra was made. I love the original characters so much better than the legend of Korra.  I thought toph was such an interesting character I loved it. The episodes of avatar the last airbender were so thrilling and exiting and amazing. There aren't any words to describe how excellent avatar the last airbender is. I wish for there to be another season of avatar the last airbender where the five characters are the same age or they find a small girl who is meant to be the avatar or something like that or just the five characters with new episodes.

Excellent series and also family rated. Teaches values while very exciting to wait for next show.

3449417,5,B001AI7766,"I really enjoyed all of the seasons of Avatar. I remember watching them as a kid and it was partly nostalgic to re-watch them. However, I stuck to the series because I really enjoyed the plot, characters, and setting. I didn't see the overall themes and depth that this story goes into until now. Social issues, fear of death, divisions among people, the journey of  finding yourself and so much more were expressed in this series. It was a sad moment when I finished this last season. I had gotten so into the show again that I didn't want it to end. I may look into the written stories that detail the events after the ending. I also watched the first episode of The Legend of Korra and that may be my next binge. Overall, I would definitely recommend this show to anyone that wishes to re-watch it or watch it for the first time.",1485388800,2,832,4.367741935483871

It has a depth while also staying very light and it does a great job of balancing it. These kids have real emotion they are goofy like all kids but they go through some real emotions and they do a really good job of handling in the show. The writing is great and the ideas of how to handle emotions and difficulty is wonderful.

3449494,5,B001AI7766,"This rating is for the whole series. This show is the best cartoon/animation I think in the world. I have been watching this show for 12 years now and it never gets old. Each season gives you something new and exciting, with humor that keeps you laughing for hours and even days. In most children shows everything is the same with no real character development. In Avatar you watch a young boy in the span of a year (3 seasons) become in a way a young man. What's so incredible is that he mentally becomes more wise and courageous, and becomes less of the young boy he once was and he also changes physically. This is the one show that has the characters change in the best way possible throughout the series.

I recommend this show to anyone no matter your age because it deals with love, family, courage, honesty, and hope. Yes, that sounds cliche and boring, but the action scenes, the humor and real world problems in the story make it so worth it. The landscapes make this show worth it as well because the creators took real live places and transformed them into a world that will live forever. Even the martial arts within the show are real, each nation has their own style and each nation has their own traditions. This show I think should be watched by adults due to the relation between the show and real life.",1484870400,,1320,4.432098765432099

Since it originally ended, I have anticipated watching it again but I wanted to wait long enough that I had forgotten a lot and I'm glad I did.  Don't bother watching the movie, it's terrible.  If you already watched the movie and not the series, don't let that deter you from watching the series, you won't be disappointed! I've convinced a lot of other people to watch this, including many anti-cartoon people, and I have yet to find someone that didn't immediately get hooked!",1478563200,,636,4.702702702702703

I have to say this, its really really amazing. All sokkas funny scenes and the fighting staff are really incredible. My most favorite part is they bendings, also when aang goes to avatar state etc.  Season three is the best hit of mine and the best anime ever. And the story is also sensible.

3450018,5,B001AI7766,"I don't even know where to start with how much I absolutely adore this show. Even though i first saw it as a kid, every time i grow older and watch it i always learn something new. Its storyline, characters, and animation go far beyond what people conceive as the simplicity of a ""kid's show."" The creativity and passion put into it by the creators are instantly evident. The creators obviously did a lot of research about many asian cultures and stories, in order to integrate them successfully into both the art and story. The episodes always have meaningful and extremely relevant messages that address issues even present today, whether it be on war and peace, love and hate, empathy or lack of it. The animation, especially whenever real-life inspired martial arts is used, is action packed and you can see so much effort put into the details of the motions and setting. But overall, the diversity and development of the characters are phenomenal. Unlike your basic kids show, the identified 'good guys' or 'bad guys' are not black-and-white. The show does a fantastic job allowing viewers to empathize with the characters. Nobody is purely good, but they're also not purely evil. The 'good guys' have their own shortcomings to overcome, and the 'bad guys' are still human and, unlike a lot of other kids shows, are shown to have motives that aren't to just 'take over the world.' We see that everybody has their reasons for why they do something. Not only more entertaining, but realistic to the world. Finally, youll end up loving the characters themselves, from kind, meek Aang to eventually noble and redeemed Zuko. All in all, the show does an amazing job executing out a very complex and intriguing storyline, all the while teaching great morals and maintaining a witty, humorous charm. It's had me both laughing and crying at all the right places. You won't regret getting this one!!!",1476748800,81,1896,4.836923076923077

3450175,5,B001AI7766,"There's no way you actually need to read a review for this show. It's great. But you know that already. What are you waiting for? More insightful commentary? Fine.
This show seems to portray the common theme of east vs west. The west, portrayed by the Fire Nation, has built the greatest empire the world has ever known. They are colonizing islands and expanding their territory aggressively. Their cities are densely populated and wealthy, but their leaders are fierce, uncompromising, and power-mad. The east is portrayed by the Earth Kingdom. Within Ba Sing Se, the last remaining city unconquered by the Fire Nation, there is widespread corruption and censorship, likely pulling from China's long-standing seclusionist policies. Aang is the last of the air benders, and though he comes from the southern water tribe, the third season has the protagonists take refuge in the eastern air temple. The significance of the extinction of the air benders at the hands of the Fire Nation is intentionally parallel to the nuclear bombing of Japan. Note that every other nation has been widely affected by the expansion and occupation of the Fire Nation, but the air benders have been all but wiped out.
Looking at the map of the Avatar's fictional world, these assertions become even more clear. The Fire Nation is located in the far west, isolated from the vast eastern land. The Earth Kingdom is divided into three great sections: the northwest, representing Europe, the southern desert, representing Arabia and India, and the northeast, representing China. The eastern air temple is in roughly the same shape and location as Japan, which is appropriate for a Japanese storyline.
As the story progresses, we see a savior/restorer in Aang who draws power from his past lives, but also must connect with nature and the spirits to bring peace. **Spoiler** He is also a pacifist who would rather disarm and disable his opponent than end his life. **Spoiler** It is easy to say that Aang a natural champion of Japanese culture.
There's plenty more social, political, and cultural commentary in the show if you watch for it, but it's never overt, never preachy, and the show is more than enjoyable to watch without participating in the metaphors.",1473984000,2,2237,5.016129032258065

3450314,5,B001AI7766,"The show really hits it's stride in this final season. The show is absolutely amazing through all seasons, but it all comes together here. The action is on point, the character relationships and personalities really shine through, there is a lot of wonderful lore that gets expounded on, and the conclusion is an epic 4-part finale that wraps things up really beautifully. I'd recommend this to just about anybody on earth... especially seeing as this is the finale season- if you're considering this season you probably already enjoyed the first two.

The world that Avatar has built is so beautiful that you probably will be sad at the end of the season because... well, because it's over. Luckily for you, you can move on to the comics that the writers have produced and also consider The Legend of Korra.",1470787200,,808,4.81294964028777

3450342,1,B001AI7766,"Absolute garbage. Not the show, the show is great. One of my favorites of all time. But these DVDs are terrible. I could forgive the low picture quality, annoying commercials (including ones for the very season I was watching back on book 2), and bad menus. What I can't tolerate is the discs skipping. I bought these a few years back. My girlfriend watched them on her computer around that time and had no issues. Now we're watching them together and season 1 went okay. During season 2, one of the discs (the one with the secret tunnel episode) started skipping ahead, freezing, and sometimes skipping whole episodes and going back to the menu because it thought it was done. We switched from playing it on my PS3 to PS4 and the rest of the season went fine. I figured maybe we'd been overusing the PS3 or it was having issues and we went on to season 3. We got to the last disc and it started the same thing, possibly even worse, proving the problem is with the discs. They have no scratches and they've previously been played only once, so they couldn't possibly be worn out or whatever. We got it to be stable again by pure luck and persistence now so hopefully we can finish the show but I have no confidence going forward that any discs will work reliably if I want to rewatch again, and now I'm doubting my intention to pick up box sets of some other Nickelodeon shows from my childhood.",1470528000,3,1395,4.410852713178294

3450345,5,B001AI7766,"When I was a young girl and the show was just coming out, my sister and I watched religiously. We were never much fans of the anime-type cartoons, but we couldn't stay away from this show. We stayed watching until the show sadly ended, but it couldn't have ended a better way. As a girl of about 7-9 years old maybe, I was captivated. It was not only thrilling and action-packed, but also comedic and heartwarming. And even if I may have not known it then, the show taught me incredible lessons.

Every now and again I go back to this show because of my deep-rooted love for it, and every time I watch the series, I learn something new. Yes, this does include better knowledge of the plot, but it's much more than that. It's taught me lessons of love, compassion, overcoming struggles, fighting for good, and believing in myself, in my destiny, and in my own ability to change the world. I go back to this show because it's quality entertainment, which I define as keeping my attention while impacting my life outside of a TV screen. This show has sparked my interest in studying philosophy, which I will be my major in college. Of course, I've always had a passion for philosophy, but this show helped me to realize this passion as well as get a glimpse of what I can be looking forward to. Never have I ever had a children's cartoon challenge me to look deeper inside myself and ask myself questions that mean something to me and my life.

If you feel discouraged to watch this show because of the age it was created for, know that everyone can take something away from it. Throughout my teens, I've occasionally come back to watch. I'm still a teenager now (17 to be exact), and I've had a lot to think about concerning my future. During these critical years of my life, it made me realize that I shape my own fate, I can choose my own path, and I have the power to bring peace and love to the world. There's so much more I can say about how the character development is inspiring and how I love the light-hearted spirit and humor of the series, but I could go on forever. Therefore, I will end by saying that you won't, under any circumstance, regret watching.",1470096000,33,2164,4.394014962593516

HOWEVER, the 4-part finale at the end of this season suffers from very bad audio. Very bad. I don't know if it was a problem with the upload or the streaming or maybe remastering, but the soundtrack is very wobbly and the pitches of the voice acting go up and down. Like a tape player with low batteries. This really sucks because the finale is, well, the finale of the show! It's the climax of the story and it suffers so badly from the poor audio quality that I couldn't fully immerse myself in the show.

3450412,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar TLA is without a doubt the most perfect manifestation of modern day entertainment. It balances humor, action, wisdom, while tackling serious existential quandries, enableing remarkable character development, all while driving a complex and profound plotline. The best thing about it is in its unassuming nature; as a kid's show you can't predict how intense it is going to get. This final season is a triumph of both closure and open ended world building with one of the most insanely intense finales of all time, and I've seen Six Feet Under. Avatar starts out a little juvenile,  really digs deep in its second season, and rises even higher in this valorous journey of a last chapter. 10 out of 5 stars.",1469232000,2,712,4.884297520661157

At the beginning of the series, I was interested in how benders from each nation would use their given powers.  Season 3 introduces a bounty hunter that Prince Zuko has hired to find the avatar.  Although he is a fire bender, his power is manifested through a third eye in his forehead which produces massive explosions.  Tof develops her earth bending skills to include the bending of metal.  There's a water bender that can bend the blood in people; another one who uses the water in plants to make himself into a near-invincible plant creature  All in all, this entire series is entertaining for adults and children.  It teaches a good lesson and the artwork is superb.  I will be following this series with the Legend of Kora.",1468454400,,823,4.666666666666667

3450778,5,B001AI7766,"I've watched this series many times since it originally aired on Nickelodeon, and I love it. Originally I was drawn in by the visual art. I was amazed at the level of detail the animators put into the show. The art isn't the only beautiful thing about Avatar. It has beauty in the friendships between Aang, Katara, Sokka and many other characters. There is beauty in Zuko's story of redemption and honor. In Iroh's wisdom and all of the faith he constantly has in his nephew. There is beauty in Katara and her love for her family and how she keeps the team together, while still being a fierce waterbender. Aang's gentleness is refreshing, at times he's very immature, but he is wise and genuinely wants the world to be at peace. Aang knows though that to find peace you need to be defensive and not just let the world walk all over him. Aang's strength and wisdom is beautiful, especially in a world that only knows of war.
I am from a generation where war is and has always been a thing. I love this show because it gives me hope that maybe things could get better. It encourages me to have a voice that seeks justice, even if I am alone in it.
I'd greatly encourage everyone to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender! It does have a lot of violence in it, though that parents of young children need to be aware of.",1465948800,2,1311,4.355102040816327

I understand the writer didn't want to promote taking another human's life especially for this age group but that's not the real world. The Villian had already killed thousands of people. Also, why is it so hard to be good and powerful at the same time? Evil seems to be absolute. They don't question their powers but ""good"" always seem to struggle and appear weak until the last moment and even then it's questionable.",1464307200,,522,4.494736842105263

3451054,5,B001AI7766,"This show is amazing and still holds with time. We are watching the series straight through on Amazon, so we can enjoy it again with our kids (4 & 7) They both love it, even though the story line is strong enough to keep an adult entertained. ((KEY note: there was a M. Night Shylaman movie LOOSELY based off this show that was terrible, if you've only seen that movie - give this show a try))

There's a great plot: Think Harry Potter - a young ""chosen one"" is the key to saving the world that is at war. And learns how to do that with his rag tag group of friends. Only instead of wizards, you have benders that can ""bend"" an element: earth, air, fire, water. The firebenders are the Slytherins and feel like they are the dominant benders and have brought war to their world in an attempt to overrule the other kingdoms.

The Avatar - the main character is the one person that can bend all 4 elements. The show does not skirt around the fact that the Avatar is reincarnated over and over and in this instance, he has been born again as a young 12-year old airbender - the last of his kind.

This show also brings with it, strong characters; they all are multi-dimensional and full of depth and growth. Not to mention the fact that this entire series is full of women who are strong and kick some serious butt! No weak maidens or ""come save me"" Lois Lane type characters. There's even a main character with a disability (she's blind) and she turns out to be the world's best earth-bender.

The third and final season concludes in one of the best (4-part) series finals that I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying in a show. I highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys solid cartoons, with interesting plots and characters. It has it's funny and silly moments too, thanks to the fun characters, but it's not your typical, goof around for 20 min type cartoon we grew up with.",1461715200,2,1883,4.386819484240688

It takes a lot of qualities that Japanese anime has and takes it's viewers on a pretty epic journey, all while keeping things humorous but allowing for the more dramatic and poignant scenes their time on the stage as well. I've rewatched it so many times that I've probably lost count by now, and as a 35 year old, it has yet to lose it's charm. I think it's a great story strong cartoon for ages 5 to adult/'grown up kid'.",1459209600,,512,4.288659793814433

3451217,5,B001AI7766,"Love this show!! Best show for out there for kids, it really teaches a lot of great things and is extremely philosophical and full of great martial arts styles although they never kill anyone, only use the MA for defense. Also very lovable characters and lots of good innocent humor that both kids and adults can enjoy. Starts out kind of kiddie but then gets more serious and is actually kind of suspenseful even for adults. Definitely 5 stars!!!!!",1459209600,,449,4.69620253164557

But near the end, in Prince Zuko's angry wrestling match with redemption and Katara's confrontation with her own loss and rage, the season finds its stride.

The only flaw I can think of is that the series isn't longer, and even that isn't a flaw, as this show accomplished everything it set out to in 3 seasons.

This show has easily the best story, character development, and lovability (if thats a word) of any series I have ever watched; animated and not. I can say that with confidence because I truly believe that I have never felt as attached to the characters in a show than to those of this one. No show has ever ended as perfectly as Avatar, and I felt whole watching the finale end knowing that there were no plot wholes to be seen. Its a great choice for anyone in the family no matter what age, and I hope you love it as much as me and my family. I hope this review was helpful; I would recommend this masterpiece to anyone of all ages, 10/10.",1457913600,2,788,4.225165562913907

I am currently a sophomore in college and I remember this show on nickelodeon but unfortunately never really watched it. One of my friends actually recommended that I watch this entire series and I am absolutely glad that I did. This series takes place in an incredibly developed Asiatic universe with a very unique set of characters and a captivating and fascinating storyline. Even though this is a kids series the main characters tackle issues which can be lessons for kids but they can also have a mature aspect to them which can also appeal to an older audience. Because of this I found myself having emotional responses to events in the series in a way that made my experience exciting as well as thrilling and only mad me want to watch more and more. If you are debating on whether you want to watch this series young or old I would say just try it, I don't think you will regret it.",1457222400,,968,4.443820224719101

3451475,1,B001AI7766,"The series is great but the last episode of the season 3 has recording a recording problem at the server site. You keep getting g error saying that the Internet is slow and the the picture keeps freezing and loading. This starts gapping right after you go past 18 minutes of viewing the  episode. I initially thought that it was my ISP problem. I stopped and rebootEd my modem the same error.  I shut off the tv and and left to watch the episode the next day . The same problem next day so I decided to check my Internet speed. It was 27mbps not what the screen says on the TV. I used my other TV and played Roku, no problems. No buffering. I tried my tab no problem. I narrowed it down to the Amazon server where the episode is coming from. No issues on my end . That spoiled the whole experience of watching Avatar.  Being the final episode and a long one with improper recording on the part of Amazon it was very upsetting and aggravating too.

An elderly uncle. A blind earthbender is a phenomenal Strong (young) Woman. And Zuko's repeated attempts at ""redemption"" before he finally understands from what he needs to redeem himself demonstrates that people can do bad things without being Bad.

I think I may watch the series again, it is fun to watch, but also full of quite a bit of life wisdom and lessons that are good for people of all ages to take to heart. Zuko is my favorite main character because I think his journey shows the most transformation, he really has to discover for himself who he is and what he wants. Iroh, Zuko's uncle is my favorite secondary character because he has grown through a lot of life experiences and learned a better way, he is happy, enjoys simple things, and is full of wisdom about what is really important in life.

3451553,4,B001AI7766,"My Kids enjoy this series. I am not much about writing details about the characters and plot so my review is very general.

The final season is one of my kids favorites.  They enjoy the twists and turns in the plot as well as the characters development with the final show wrapping it all up. When some characters change sides from the earlier seasons and the final showdown between good and evil happens there is great feeling of satisfaction for all the story lines.

Of course there is a great deal of eastern religion and mysticism with some of the characters having the power to move and control earth, fire, air and water. Reincarnation is asserted in this story line to explain the ""savior"" like character.  There is no cursing or bad language.

As a story goes the main point is good vs evil and the development of friendship and comradery of the characters that come together to battle evil.",1455580800,,900,4.6

Watching these three seasons gave me a direct connection to my late childhood and I never thought I would've been so attached to it now.

The fact that majority of these series were hand-drawn just blows me away as a Digital Arts Student. The creativity behind this show gets an A++ from me. The amazing level of storytelling, the invention of several diverse cultures and the lessons behind it.

I tend to have two categories for great shows. The four stars, which I enjoy the first time but not always the second time, and the 5 star which I can watch again and again and always enjoy just as much as the first time I watched it. This series, from start to finish falls under the 5 star rating for being amazing not only the first time, but every time after.",1446336000,,584,4.223214285714286

3451885,5,B001AI7766,"I was lead to tears at least 12 different times. I basically turned into Katara from The Ember Island Players (which single-handedly made me bust a gut from laughing so hard for 30 minutes straight.) But seriously. This last book is the greatest finale for any animated show I have ever witnessed. Every aspect was covered, there was so much room for surprises (and man, were there many!!) and yet everything was fulfilled. Everything was completed with a satisfying end. The action also was the most intense out of the entire serious ('is that really possible? what about that one time...') nope. you just gotta trust me. Prepare your spine for shivers, and your mind, because it will be BLOWN AWAY. All this is achieved through continued, masterful character developement, and stunning animation. Just prepare yourself for the tears, because even with all the hype built up for the finale through the first two books, it meets, and dramatically exceeds all expectations.",1445904000,,972,5.006172839506172

3452086,5,B001AI7766,"Wonderful animated series.  The characters and storyline are well developed and multi-layered.  In an animated series, this could be a bit cumbersome, thus dragging down the pace of the show.  However, in 'Avatar, the Last Airbender', the complex elements do nothing to detract from the freshness and fun of the show but instead makes it engaging and thoughtful. This is not just a show for children...I would recommend it to folks of all ages who love a great story.  I really hate that M. Night Shayamalan didn't do this show any favors with his terrible movie version.  Hopefully those who were introduced to the 'Avatar' series by way of the movie will take the time to watch the show so they can see what a gem it really is.",1440720000,,729,4.62015503875969

The storyline is also enjoyable especially because there are layers of morality lessons being taught without having them pounded into the story.  Also enjoyable is the friendship and love between the main characters.  Finally what tops it off is the sense of humor that is shown by the characters.  This series is fun and interesting but could easily be used for discussion with kids about making right choices, dealing with the consequences of our choices and family relationships.",1439856000,,614,5.11

3452271,5,B001AI7766,"Great series to the end. It's hard to describe it w/o giving away too much, so I'll just hit a couple of points. 1) while the shortest season, it drags on. 2) while it doesn't seem much happens until the finale, it is the season where we see the greatest amount of character development, which helps move the season along.",1436400000,,322,4.383333333333334
3452272,5,B001AI7766,One of the best animated shows I've ever seen. Perfect balance of humor and action. Good for all ages and the final season had a really intense build-up! Definitely worth watching if you never got around to it when it was on TV!,1436400000,2,228,4.325581395348837

3452274,5,B001AI7766,"This is the best animated series ever produced. Despite the loss of actor Mako as Uncle Iroh, Season 3 is the best of all three books, which says a great deal. The character development of Zuko is phenomenally well written and paced. This season, as with the entire series, should be watched by all ages and l across every culture and demographic. The messages and themes apply to all humanity. The soundtrack is especially wonderful and fuses classic East Asian instrumentals and soundscapes with a variety of other music (I mean, seriously, the ""swamp water benders"" theme track is like an Asian/bluegrass/southern vibe, who thought of that?!). The highest recommendation I can give for a series!",1436400000,,698,5.025862068965517

3452284,4,B001AI7766,"I could say it's as good as the previous 2, which would be true.  But it's also true that I gave it a 4, so what is my problem?  Well, it felt a bit rushed.  Not at the beginning of the season, just around the last 3 (treating the last combined episode as one) episodes.  And evil of me to say it I know, but I kind of liked Zuko as the bad guy.  Hear me out, I didn't want him to stay bad I just wanted to get to know him more after he changed.  And the ending to the whole thing.  Now that just felt anti climatic.  I guess what I am saying for the whole thing is that I wanted more.  I mean this is the 3 season.  The one we have been waiting for for 2 other seasons and the ending is...that.  That's what I liked about the other seasons, they never felt rushed and they had good characters with back stories.  To summarize, I'm saying it should be my favorite and it's not.",1435968000,,877,3.865168539325843

Nothing compares to the last episode of this season, and of course you have to see everything that leads up to it. The build-up through out the season, and from the previous 2 seasons, put all the pieces together for a spectacular finish. If I had a fireworks gif, I'd be pasting it right here.

If you have any questions, you can find me nerding out with the three follow up graphic novels that I wish had been added to the TV series.",1435968000,,502,4.229166666666667

3452297,5,B001AI7766,"The Avatar series IS the best animated series that will ever grace your family's home. Each season has its own precisely-planned flavor. The first season introduces you to the mystical world and diverse characters. The second season reveals their individual background stories and the sources of their own internal conflicts.
In this final season, each character is faced with mighty external challenges that will test their own perceived identities. What can a pacifist monk do when he is charged with the duty to end a war driven by a relentless tyrant? What is the honor-bound prince to do when he begins to doubt his nation's ideology? And what is the optimistic comic-relief to do when he is cast into serious situations where others' lives are in his hands?

Sad that we are almost all the way through all three seasons. Avatar has a GREAT story, with a huge arc, interspersed with fun comedy. The characters are great -- Wish there was more! :)",1433721600,,325,4.09375

3452350,5,B001AI7766,"Probably one of my favorite cartoon series of all times. It has a great story that doesn't drag out so long that it gets old, repetitive, and mundane. Only 3 seasons, but the series closes out in a manner that leaves no cliff hangers and brings closure. It's a creative story with really well thought out characters with well done character development too. It's one of the few cartoons I don't mind my kid watching over and over without getting annoyed",1433721600,,453,4.604938271604938

If you are looking for something where all of them will look the same on your shelf though, this work but they have some problems. My Book 1: Water box looks great and is uniform. Book 2: Earth has problems with the Nickelodeon logo being off center and being cut off. Finally my Book 3: Fire has a Nick Symbol underneath the outer edge which makes them not look uniform when on a shelf.

3452416,5,B001AI7766,"If you are a lover of good serial TV, but not necessarily animation, I challenge you to watch the season 1 episode 1 of Avatar: The Last Airbender. You will be hooked. This could be one of the best animated series ever created. I did not see it as it originally aired, but watched it on Amazon Prime with my kids (10 and 6) and wife last year. The story, character development, animation, and voice acting are nothing short of superb. The creators did not speak down to their audience like many kid's shows do and consistently delivered episodes that could be enjoyed by young and old. Everyone in my household enjoyed watching Aang grow as a bender and as a person throughout the series. I really can't say enough about how good this series is. Season 3 is my favorite out of the 3 as they upped the stakes and really put the characters in situations they would not have been able to handle in season one. The creators were able to show the characters grow in a very organic and believable way and no character was a throwaway character. Everyone had something to contribute to the narrative.

If you are looking for a storyline that is deep with a great backstory, great development, and is fun without being silly, please watch this series from beginning to end. You will not be disappointed.",1431388800,3,1295,4.534188034188034

3452451,4,B001AI7766,"I posted here before about a mishap with the product that amazon quickly corrected. It's good service and quick response to fix the mistake was amazing to receive :)
Avatar: The Last Airbender is a beautifully crafted show, a true gem, that I highly recommend anyone buying. For the price, the creative box art, and the neatly packed disks it's all a pretty reasonable buy. My only issue with the quality of the packaging is how the dvd's are put in - it ends up packing them so that 2 disks are stacked/overlapping each other. It makes it a bit awkward to get to the next disk, but other than that there's truly nothing wrong with it.
The content on the disks possesses beautiful animation that you'd expect from this show and the story is riveting and shows each character's struggles surprisingly well. The only thing I could truly wish for is to add more special features on the disks. The most you see are interviews with M. Night Shyamalan (why was he on there!? -.-) and commentary on the episodes. I'd love to see a version that you could buy that let you have the little fun fact pop ups they had in the show that aired on TV. The popups were neat and made you feel more apart of the Avatar's world so I wouldn't mind that being a possible special feature option.
Past that, there's really not much I can say about what I don't like. The quality of the show is good, the story it tells is phenomenal, the characters themselves have such great personalities and actually develop throughout the 3 seasons. The presentation of the disks is great and they are packaged well, so there's really not much to complain about. You do get your money's worth. The only thing I wish for is to maybe package the disks better so they're easier to remove from case and to give the option for more special features. I mean, this is a $15 set. I feel like if they include a bonus disk in each season for special features there should be more on there than what was stated previously. Would I still recommend that people buy this? Yes, yes I would. I just prefer to see a little more given

And M. Night Shyamalan taken off and moved very far away from the series (sorry to people who like him, that's just my opinion)",1430438400,,2208,4.398533007334963

Not just cartoon, or kids show (though certainly it is those things) but just a great show.  By the 3rd Season the writers have really zeroed in on what works and what doesn't in the show.  There were certainly some missteps, Katara's journey with Zuko I found very jarring and out of character for her.  But a couple of episodes earlier she delivers a warning to Zuko that just made my blood run cold, it was really wonderful.

What amazing fun, and worth watching again and again.  Just go do it and thank me later.",1430265600,,680,4.479674796747967

3452481,5,B001AI7766,"I remember seeing some of this series as a kid in the mid-2000s when it came out, but I wrote it off as an Americanized anime that wasn't anything original. I was proven wrong when I took the chance to watch it now in my final year of college. This series is phenomenal in so many ways. The animation is beautiful, the story(ies) are written very well and come full-circle, it incorporates light heartedness and humor that's good for kids/it never takes itself too seriously. The themes within it are just amazing. The characters have a lot of depth to them, and you can tell the people behind the show took time to study the history and philosophies of East Asian cultures. For a Nickelodeon show that's aimed towards kids, that's impressive.

Some of the action and fighting sequences are spectacular, especially in the final season. As with any show, there are a few random episodes that don't move the story much forward, but they're important because they provide insight for certain characters. They draw you into the world of the series more and it's very effective. The story carries enough conflict and emotional backstory to get anyone wrapped into it. I used to watch anime a lot when I was younger but this has to be one of the best animated series I've seen overall. It's a well-rounded package. It even executes some things better than some of the anime/manga I loved as a kidDragon Ball Z, Naruto, Inu Yasha, etc. And that's saying something.

Don't write it off as a kid's show. It only gets better with each season. And now I can't wait to watch Korra because I've only heard good things about that.",1429660800,2,1616,4.627177700348432

3452738,5,B001AI7766,"We have Amazon Prime so we watch our favorite tv shows and movies on prime.  Occasionally, I would check the site for good movies and read all of the reviews.  There are so many that it is difficult to decide more often than not because reviews are always subjective.  One reviewer might like a movie/tv show and give it 5 stars and one might not like it at all and give it 2 stars.  I stumbled upon this nickolodeon series last year and read the reviews and started watching the very 1st episode of season 1.  Because I am an adult and to me animation is usually for kids, I watched episode 1 for only about 10 minutes and thought it was childish.  Last December 2014 while visiting my sister in Canada and spending X'mas there, we spent a lot of time watching movies and tv shows.  She told me about a Japanese animation movie that was really good.  I watched it and she watched it the 2nd time.  We both enjoyed it very much.  It was because of this that I became interested in good animation movies or shows. So I started searching for animation tv shows to watch (a complete series so there is an ending and conclusion) and stumbled again on ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"".  This time I read ALL of the reviews and decided to give it a try and watch at least 5 complete episodes to see if it will get me hooked.  INDEED, IT DID!  Kudos to the writers!!! The storyline is truly amazing!!!  Truly awesome!!! Who could come up with a storyline of powers of bending the earth; air; water and fire? Of a child and his friends fighting evil to save the world?  I just could not get enough of the series and when it was coming to an end I was sad because I didn't want it to end.  Every episode, every story catches your attention and you want to keep going to know what was going to happen next. Every human emotion was portrayed here- love; hate; fury; forgiveness; power; ambition; strength; and compassion.  I love all of the characters; their strong bond of friendship; and their development. My favorite is the blind Toph.  This show is NOT just for kids.  Everybody should watch it.  I know that I will watch it again sometime in the near future as it is super GOOD!",1423872000,,2169,4.33498759305211

3452750,3,B001AI7766,"I really liked season 1 of avatar, but thought that season two seemed to be grinding it's feet without going anywhere.  Now we come to the final season, and while it's definitely better than season 2, there are just too many frustrating flaws for me to fully recommend it, including a disappointing ending.

MAJOR SPOILERS!

What I liked:
- Some extremely impressive hand-drawn animation
- A lot of direct conflict with the fire nation (no longer absent like in season 2)
- More character development for Sokka
- Very realistic portrayal of Aang's internal conflicts
- ""Day of the Black Sun"" is really good and exciting
- Zuko finally sees the light
- Some nice humor
- We get to see Appa and Momo swordfighting!

What I didn't like:
- I'm glad Bumi appeared in the finale, but I'm still not sure what happened with him.  He defeated the firebenders on the day of the eclipse, but surely the fire nation would have sent reinforcements to retake Omashu?  I was hoping he would play a much bigger role in the rebellion, we just saw a few short scenes of him fighting.  I think there were so many wasted opportunities with this amazing character, but he barely appeared after his introductory episode.

- Iroh plays a big role this season.  His arc sounds great on paper, but the voice actor who played Iroh died.  The person they got to replace him can't act and sounds nothing like the original.  Every time he speaks it is painful to watch, his heart and soul are gone.  They should have paid their respects to the original actor by either killing him off in a honourable way, or by coming up with some excuse for why he cannot speak.  I would have absolutely loved this part of the season if the original voice actor had lived, but as it is this part is terrible.

- Things get out of hand with the bending.  Last season we had metalbending, now we have bloodbending, sweatbending, etc.  The original powers were more than powerful enough, this has gone overboard.

- Constant battles rage, rife with explosions and fireballs, but no characters we know the name of ever dies. Totally unrealistic and sends kids the wrong message, that if you've got heart you are invincible.

- Combustion man.  Initially I thought, ""Wow, a fascinating new enemy who's too powerful even for Team Avatar!  This should make great TV!"".  But the guy is given no backstory or name, and offs himself after just a couple of appearances.  What a waste of potential plotlines.

- The Beach.  You've developed great villains, now we have an episode where they all act totally out of character and revert to standard teenage tropes.  Oh, and give a few lines of half-hearted backstory to a couple of characters who should have had it much earlier. Blech.

- Ember Island Players.  Another horrible episode, my least favorite in the series.  We're moments away from the final showdown, so let's go watch a play?  How could anyone know all these intimate moments? (No, the Cabbage man wasn't there for all of them, just a few).  You've told a a great story, now let's cheapen the memory by pointing out how silly it was?  Also, I felt it was a bit of a spoiler, since they showed one possible ending in the play you know they wouldn't do the same ending in reality, and I hate spoilers. Finally, why would Aang & co be the stars of the show in a Fire Nation telling of the story?  Zhao, Azula and Ozai should have been the stars! Now that would have been fun to watch!

- Constant success.  My beef with the past seasons continues, every time team avatar fights the fire nation, they either triumph or say ""that looks tough, let's run and live to fight another day"".  They never unambiguously fail, which is needed for character development and good drama.

- Ozai.  I'm glad we finally see his face, and his voice actor is great. But I was hoping that this season we would really see some great character development here, and finally get to see this awesome firebender and mastermind at work.  Instead, he's kept hidden away most of the season, only really showing up in the finale.  We don't get much of any insight into who he is, and from his action in the finale he appears to be fairly stupid and not all that gifted in the bending department.  So why are we spending the whole series watching people prepare to fight him again? It seems like he could have been dispatched in season one.

- Azula.  This character never made much sense to me, but now the writers decided she should turn from a strong female to full-on crazy lady in the space of a couple episodes.  Huh?!  They could have turned this character into something great, but she's now one of my least favorite villians ever.

- Several times, various characters are given ample opportunity to defeat Ozai and end the war, but refuse because ""that's the Avatar's destiny, not mine"".  Huh?!  So you're willing to let hundreds die just because you wanted to give a 12-year-old boy a chance to fulfill his destiny?! This makes no sense!

- The final battle.  Really disappointing.  Ozai knows that Zuko has joined Team Avatar and knows his plan, but he proceeds with no modifications anyway?  He doesn't even defend his airships in any way, so they can all be destroyed by literally slamming them into each other? He wants to take out the earth kingdom but doesn't start with Ba Sing Se, its epicenter?  None of the firebenders defending Ba Sing Se appear to have grown stronger due to the comet? As for the fight we've all been waiting for between Ozai and Aang, its resolved with two massive, unrealistic deus ex machinas (hitting a spike=unlock chakra and spiritbending). What a cheap move.  A real letdown.

- What happened to Azula?  She's chained up somewhere for eternity?  No cell could hold her!

- What happened to Toph's family?  This is a MAJOR loose end that was never resolved.  Are they still out hunting for her and worrying about her?

So some great moments, but too uneven with a poor ending. 3.7/5, but I'll round down to counter all the 5-star reviews.",1421625600,,6009,4.576382380506092

It's debatably the most emotional and dramatic out of the three books, the battles are epic (from what I remember; I haven't re-watched the entire thing yet), and the conclusion is actually satisfying. Too often, a good series is ruined by a terrible ending, but thankfully, that's not the case here. There are, of course, things I might have done differently, but that can be said for just about any ending.
The episodes are set up the same way as Book Two; five episodes on each of the first four discs, and the special features on the fifth disc.",1420502400,,629,4.478260869565218

3452766,5,B001AI7766,"People praise this show a lot.  And it turns out it basically deserves the praise.  Eschewing the infinite episodic nature of most contemporary children's animation, it sets itself out from the get-go as a story which will lead to an inevitable conclusion.  Some of the episodes during the first season feel a bit more disjointed, but by the time Season 3 is upon us, the show has really hit its stride.  Of note is the development of characters within this season, and some actual surprises in terms of narrative.  The animation quality is still pretty fresh for its time, and the martial arts and mythology are well captured.

The subject matter isn't as intellectually provocative as the later series, The Legend of Korra, but philosophically, the show is still mature enough that older kids and adults can appreciate it, without going over the heads of young viewers.",1420329600,,871,4.891156462585034

Most of the teachings in the shows are pretty ""Wise"" but it gives no guidance to dealing with pubescent hormones.  Otherwise, the show is great!",1419811200,,346,4.292307692307692

3452832,5,B001AI7766,"If I can say anything about this show it would be that it is simply amazing.
Avatar the last airbender is a show that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. I first watched this show when it first came out on Nickelodeon when I was 12 and I loved it! 7 years later I've watched the entire show maybe about 6 times and it is still fantastic. From the characters, to the themes, action, animations, music and comedy this show is sure to be enjoyed by anyone.

First off, the story line is beautiful. It's about a 12 year old boy named Aang who is the avatar, the bridge between the sport and human world. He is the only person able to bend the 4 elements, earth, air, water and fire. Anyways, at the begining we find out Aang ran away from home because he didn't want to be the avatar, he wanted to be normal. So when he ran away, him and his spiritual animal, Appa, a flying bison, get hit by a storm. So to save their lives, Aang bends the water around them and creates an iceberg. 100 years later a water bender girl named Katara and her hilariously sarcastic non bender brother Sokka find Aang on a fishing trip down in the south pole.  Within the 100 years that Aang was gone, the fire nation decided to try and conquer the world. First they do an airbender genocide knowing that Aang would have been born to the air nomads. Then they pillage and attack all other parts of the world. At this time, Fire Lord Ozai was in search of the avatar but failed to find him like his father's. In comes banished Prince Zuko, a trouble teen who was told his life's goal was to kill or capture the avatar in order to be welcomed home. Zuko is also accompanied by his uncle Iroh, a humble and smart old man. Within the three seasons Avatar Aang has to help defeat the fire nation and bring balance to the world. He makes friends along the way, some you wouldn't even imagine.
That's just a small intro to the show.

Throughout the show we see all sides of each charter, we see their good, bad and vulnerable sides. That's the thing I love, they all feel real too me. None are perfect and none are all that evil. Aang the avatar is suppossed to be kind and to help people but even sometimes he gets made and makes bad decisions.

This show is really big on the friendship theme and that's something you will see throught it.
There are scenes that will make you cry. I've cried maybe about 3 times throught the whole show.

It worth watching and you will fall in love with it. I sure did. I made my girlfriend watch it at the age of 18 and even she loves it and became obssessed like I am. Avatars the Last Airbender is a really fantastic show.",1419033600,,2629,4.198019801980198

I think the creators did a good job with all 3 seasons having the over reaching story planned out and having all of the characters develop throughout.  We sort of feel like the whole show was our life changing adventure with Zuko.
The show made us feel all of the things.  I'm not saying the show made me cry, but I think there was someone cutting onions while I was watching it.",1418428800,,536,4.028301886792453

I just finished watching the series and it is by far the best animated series that I have ever seen. It moves  you through emotions of happiness, anger, frustration, love, the human bond, anger, sorrow, and loss of loved ones. The transition seems flawless and you can relate to the characters and feel what they are going through. Even though a few of the episodes were creepy like blood bending but overall hands down I would recommend this to anyone and I will be sure to watch this again to live through the experience. It is just sad that the original series is over  and I know the characters will live on inside me and inspire people who watch this.",1414713600,,781,4.342465753424658

3452986,4,B001AI7766,"Although the 3rd book/3rd season of Avatar the Last Airbender is great.. there are some issues with the DVD case it comes in. Not sure if it's just my copy or if all copies are like this but the inner part plastic, part thin cardboard DVD case that hold the discs is both too long and slightly oblong on one side, making it uneven and stick part of the way of the outer DVD slip case. Speaking of the outer case.. it's too tall for the inner DVD case to fit properly. .there's a noticeable gap between the top of the inner DVD case and the outer case.. so between the out case being to too tall and the inner case being too long on one side.. the inner case slides around inside the out case and doesn't really fit right..this wasn't a problem with the first 2 complete season box sets and while it doesn't affect the quality of the episodes at all, I expected the DVD case to be as good as the other 2 DVD box set cases were.

Other then that, the only other problem with the DVD set is that the 5th bonus disc is way too hard to get out of it's holder.. felt like I was going to break the disc trying to get it out..

Beyond the DVD case problems, the complete 3rd book of Avatar the Last Airbender is great.. wish there was some kind of retrospective feature for the final season, but oh well the episodes and limited special features are still great as they are.

the episodes and features themselves get 5 star rating but the messed up, badly manufactures DVD case gets a 2 star rating for it's poor manufacturing job.",1414195200,,1523,4.191126279863481

I have watched all 3 seasons multiple times and it gets better every time and I pick up on new things each time. It is great for any age and if any adults are thinking they are not going to waste time watching a show from nickelodeon is wrong. This show is worth it trust me and in my opinion this was one of the very few shows worth watching on nickelodeon. I went to go see the Avatar Movie and was appalled how badly they botched not just the story but literally everything else, it sucked don't waste your time. The show is where its at. All of the valuable life lessons learned throughout this show is actually quite astonishing in the ways the watcher can apply them to their own life. I usually don't take the time to write reviews about shows but this show deserves it. The character development and emotional connections you feel towards the characters is unmatched by any other animated (and even many non-animated shows) show I have ever seen. It has it all Action, Love, Drama, Comedy, Suspense with Fantastic Animation Effects and Amazing Character Development. Each character's voice actor really outdid themselves as well. You can really hear and feel the emotions in their voices which I love. This show displays a true hero with a good heart and how he and his friends must save the world from evil without letting that evil swallow them up and destroy who they were for there is only one thing anyone can truly control-whether they are good or evil.",1412380800,,1586,4.568421052631579

Each ""Book"" is as good as the last and they don't loose momentum. It never falls back on the weird or creepy just to keep the kids engaged as many of the cartoon series often do. Always family friendly, and always entertaining with some good old fashioned morals, values and life lessons mixed through out. Thanks to Amazon Prime we can watch the series, commercial free, in its entirety for free. As many times as we want and if someone needs to play catch up that can be done with ease because of the way it is formated.

My only complaints about the show is that it was created for Nickleodeon and rated for as young as 7(the fights looks amazing but aren't violent) but the storyline is engaging for all ages.

If any of the Nickolodeon team happens to read these reviews, seeing a ""Aang the final years"" or a telling of his adult life would easily draw a huge fan following, much like we've seen with Clone Wars.",1410393600,,521,4.7032967032967035

3453143,5,B001AI7766,"The third season wraps up the series for Avatar: The Last Airbender.  Without giving much away, this was ended in a thoughtful and exciting way.  We finally find the fulfillment of several characters long journeys of self discovery, and see the end of the 100-year war with the Fire Nation.  The characters each come fully into their own and prove themselves to be very powerful masters of their individual disciplines.  Metalbending is discovered, bloodbending is unfortunately discovered, and Sokka gets a space sword!  And then there is the budding romance.

This is one of the finest piece of animation in american cartoon shows i have ever seen. this is something which is suppose to be for kids but makes adults to enjoy as well. I wonder if that was a surprise for the creators to create a show just for kids but didn't expect adults to love it. The last time i have seen this level of likeness and deep story was STAR WARS. I think it has that same exact same feeling just in a different way of telling the story. now it finished aired in 2008, the popularity is still growing and will never get old. whats next? I am 100% percent watching the legend of Korra! Right now spread the word on this show (same as me with my family who are adults) to show this is not some silly kid cartoon like not at all!",1409616000,,848,4.023668639053255

In this season, I quite enjoyed the further development of Zuko's character. I loved how he finally stepped out from worrying about how others perceived him, and followed his own path. Would recommend this series to anyone, as it has enough good qualities to entertain both children and adults.
It did seem as though they were setting up for a fourth season at the end, and I would have loved to see it! However, it was not meant to be, but even without it, the three seasons stand as a completed story arc, and is extremely enjoyable.",1409270400,,706,4.396946564885496

3453181,5,B001AI7766,"This is a great culmination of the Avatar trilogy. There are a couple of episodes that dig into the theology/philosophy of the avatar world and of of course plenty of fun and action. I personally found the final battle and its resolution to be epic. My one complaint is some underdeveloped story when (spoiler alert) the giant lion turtle teaches him to chi-bend. Even the second time through I though it was abrupt and insufficiently explained, while they spend almost an entire episode on Ang's angst and sleeplessness. Other than that it is a hit for 5 year olds and 30 year olds alike. The writers really know how to build a solid hero story.",1409270400,,646,4.626086956521739

3453250,5,B001AI7766,"My family loves this show. It's a great show to watch with your kids because it has a compelling story line, likeable and flawed characters, and humor. It is never inappropriate, which I appreciate. I really enjoy watching it with my kids because the character are not good and evil -- they are complex. There are good characters who do bad things, and there are some characters who may be ""bad"" but the show explores their motivations for such behavior. I'm probably reading too much into the show, but it's not like so many kids shows with the good/evil dichotomy.",1407369600,,566,4.67
3453251,4,B001AI7766,Great and awesome show but some of the episodes weren't playing for some reason. They worked after a day or two but still a bit annoying when you want to go through a marathon.,1407369600,,176,4.205882352941177

This is the book that we see the most growth, change and maturity in the original Team Avatar and also the book where you do not have to go looking for the plot, you're in the thick of it. If the other seasons took you a while to get through, you'll breeze through book three because it's just that good.

3453281,5,B001AI7766,"I loved watching it, uninterrupted. After watching all three books I am convinced that Book 3 is the funniest and has some of the most red hot intense scene's, pun intended. For the third book I give 5 stars.

It is too bad there were only three books and not four, to cover all of the elements. I was hoping that the adventures after the war would continue. How would the fire nation restore it's honor? Where is Zukko's mother? Does Aang find a way to being the process to restoring the Air Nomad's civilization? None the less, the great season ending worked for a good series ending too.

My only issue was not with the show but with when I opened the box. I give that a two out of five. One of the plastics prongs that holds Disc one was broken so the disc did not stay in place. When I first opened it the disc almost fell out of the case. I just grabbed a paper sleeve and slipped it into the center of the box. I do not know where the case in shipment broke but I put the blame towards Amazon's shipping prep. The DVD box was 'protected' with a single sheet of bubble wrap laying under it. There was nothing on top or around it. There was nothing keeping the case from shifting around the box. The DVD box should have been fully wrapped in a bubble sheet with some extra paper or bubbles to keep the box from knocking around as much as possible. Perhaps the whole two day shipping was too much of a rush. Maybe the prong would not have broken if it was unrushed shipping.",1406678400,,1478,4.182456140350877

The Avatar series is fun and definitely NOT to be taken as serious Anime.  After all, it's American.  It pokes a little fun here and there at the Chinese and Japanese cartoons.  (I don't know if it pokes fun at Korean anime.  I haven't seen any of that.)  But, it's entertaining and fairly well thought out.

He is trying to learn all the elements in order to restore peace in all the nations.  Since he is of the Air tribe he already knows how to air bend and fire is the hardest for him to learn since it is opposite air.  This series is funny and exciting.

But I am not finished with the season yet and can't wait to see the finale, which is one or two episodes away from where I am.  This is a fun show because the characters are always fighting villans with their powers of the elements. FUN SHOW!",1404518400,,466,3.978494623655914

I will be washing clothes or doing work but listening to make sure I am comfortable with the show and It humors me to no end.

This show will appeal to anyone who appreciates great animation, rich story telling, unique character development, epic martial arts battles or the occasional lame pun.

I'm a Christian; so I'm not a fan of the Buddhist spirituality that happens to be the premise of the whole show, but I was raised with a ""eat the fish, spit out the bones"" philosophy, and this show has has a much higher fish:bones ratio than most supposedly Christian shows.
It's clean, it's funny, it's deep, and it's got awesome fighting! It does a fantastic job of exploring the characters and the world they live in.
If you're a Christian and you have kids, you should be sure to watch it with them so that you can talk to them about the spiritual aspects of the show, but it actually presents a great opportunity to talk with them about things that don't come up in a normal day's conversation.",1402185600,,745,4.405797101449275

3453410,5,B001AI7766,I first saw the Avatar movie. that movie eventually lead me to the shows. I find the shows much better than the movie and the story line was much better too. the show was so good I finishes all three books in about four days and I really wish Nickelodeon continued the T.V. aang Avatar series. they did continue series as a graphic novel and a second series that jumps into the future to the next Avatar in the legend of korra. But I believe this show is so good and well  written with these types of morals that as long as it was still written in the same manner the series should continue without end until it catches up to the Korra timeline. I recommend to watch it as many times as possible. this series will become a classic like the home alone movie. This is a Must see series.,1401926400,,784,4.19205298013245

Way better than it's sister series, Legend of Korra, which was less than satisfactory and should be largely ignored as a part of the world.

I made my boyfriend who majored in history watched it and he said each four nation is suppose to represent the Asian countries during WWII.  Fire nation represents Japan when it invaded the other Asian countries to become a powerhouse. I think Water tribe is suppose to be the Southeast Asian countries; not sure too much about Earth or Air.

But how it's created through children cartoon is phenomenal. This show depicts many issues from war, love, hope, despair, death, etc., and how essentially these kids have to make adult-like decisions.

Recommended for families or those who love an original animation.  No great anime/cartoon animation has ever existed like this in my world.",1401840000,2,802,5.091603053435114
3453414,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best and most satisfying ""hero's journey"" stories I've ever seen.  I hope there are no adults out there who still cling to the notion that cartoons are only for children.  For they are depriving themselves of a rich and wonderful and evolving method of storytelling.

I laughed, cried, got angry, was enchanted, was mesmerized, and was blown away. I may be a little biased, though, as I am a fan of anime, of asian culture, and of sci-fi/fantasy, all of which figure heavily in Avatar.

Is every episode a winner?  Of course not.  The series has its slow moments, too.  However, I blame that on the network's (any network's) ridiculous notion that a series MUST HAVE at least 20 episodes per season.  In other words, I KNOW some series are forced to write ""filler"" episodes in order extend storylines and meet the quota.  I am always suspicious when time is of the essence, yet characters find the time to ""wind down"" or ""take a few days off"", one might argue that even heroes need a break, or it has to do with pacing the story, but I am more inclined to think that the original story has been tampered with by people ""higher up"" who think they know how to tell a story, but really don't have a clue.  (Can you tell I have an utter hatred of filler episodes?)  Regardless, Avatar is a superb journey, filled with memorable heroes, villains, morals, quandries, and concepts.

I think there is something for everyone in Avatar.  I think anyone who watches Avatar: The Last Airbender will come out enriched and more than satisfied.

If your kids have watched it, I urge them to return to it every few years, for I'm sure they will see things differently and maybe notice things they didn't see before.

I am 44 years old and just watched it for the first time.  I know I will watch it in its entirety every few years.",1401840000,,1856,4.479166666666667

3453429,5,B001AI7766,"Just what the other reviewers have already said - amazing character development, excellent story pacing, good blends of non-religious spiritual understanding with genuinely human emotion and learning, and appropriate and often beautiful animation.  It is a series you can watch over and over without getting sick of it yet learning or garnering something new each time.  Traditional anime (which this is not, but still) often tells stories of determination and redemption.  The hero loses again and again, and yet does not give up.  They may despair, they may lose confidence, they may even lose faith, but they do not give up.  Tenacity is an amazingly valuable thing when facing difficult problems - and so many of our problems are truly difficult ones.  Not giving up is critical.  Series like this - these characters - while they may be fiction and while they may exist in a world of fantasy, they still teach real lessons - no less real than the novels and philosophies that we appreciate and study in academia.  They teach us about second chances and changing our points of view as we learn new facts, and being honest to ourselves and our friends and loved ones (ever notice how any time there is an inter-character issue it has to do with lying and misleading actions?).  They teach us about failure and success and the importance of always learning and working towards new goals and skills.  They teach us about team-work and trust and the value of true friends.  And they teach one of the most important lessons that often goes unlearned in modern society - no one succeeds by giving up.

And almost no one (not even the avatar) gets it right on the first try.

If our culture - our children and our society could learn just these two things - that there will be failures, but that doesn't mean you get to give up or quit - we would be able to make so much more of our world.

It is an art worth learning; the art of honorable tenacity.  Watch the series.  I doubt you'll regret it.",1400803200,2,1992,4.6164772727272725

I would not recommend it for younger children (you parents are the best judge), my younger ones (5+/-) are more aggressive if I let them watch it. My 9yo LOVES it, the silly humor is perfect for him, and he seems able to handle the more serious scenes well so-far. The humor is very well balanced to also allow adults to enjoy it. I can't get enough of Uncle Iroh!

I do wish they would have done it in widescreen, this is a 4:3 aspect ratio. Even so, my family and I don't really notice the bars on the sides we're so engrossed in the story.",1400803200,,578,4.0701754385964914

I love Uncle Iroh for his patience and wisdom.  I love Zuko and the conflict that he had to endure.  Usually, people who go through such conflicts right usually make the best leaders because they are so in touch with matters of the heart.  The humor was off the charts.  No one can touch it.

I felt like it was over for me when this series ended.  I was like, ""what am I gonna do""?

Truly loved it.",1399248000,,570,3.8869565217391306

3453465,5,B001AI7766,"As a series, I really enjoyed Avatar.  The plot was very broad but had deep lessons for the characters.  Despite being somewhat shallow, as it is a children's show, the characters had a decent amount of characater growth.  Aang and his friends had to face serious problems that span beyond a children's show.  For that reason alone, I enjoyed watching the entire series.  It may be too serious for young children but the show was pretty sweet.  I loved the action and the animation.  Sometimes you could definitely tell when special effects were poorly blended with the hand-drawn backgrounds.  But overall, fantastic show.  I loved it and would watched it all over again.",1399161600,2,672,4.876106194690266

3453467,5,B001AI7766,"This is hands down the best season out of the entire series of avatar. It has the most action and intensity. Everything about it is intriguing. In this series, the show dives more into each of the characters background/personalities and you find out so much about them; even Azula and her friends!

This season was a great end to the series. Through the laughs, adrenaline rush, and teary eyes of joy and sadness, I can most definitely say that even through the end of the series, this show held out and I am still a loyal fan. It's enough to wish the arrival of a new season, but then you realize it just might not be the same...",1398988800,2,630,4.338983050847458

I, a couple times, watched 3 shows in one sitting.  Lol well that's how much I enjoyed it.  It's a great story.  I just hope if they plan to make part 2 in the movie theaters they would get there story right now that I have seen the whole thing.  Lol. Well hope you all enjoy it as much as I have.

3453484,5,B001AI7766,As an indian person who has been submerged in the culture I must say the writers did their research so well. I was able to make many connections to Hinduism and the Buddhist stem of hinduism. This show is absolutely wonderful at teaching children the roots of such deep ideals and helping adults connect with new theories or expand on pre-set theories from a new perspective. I throughly enjoyed each and every single episode and the entire show was a total blast to witness. All I wish for is more from this amazing world the writers constructed so well. The characters were so human and relatable I felt a connection with all of them. This show does a fantastic job of showing what humanity and morality should truly look like. There is no mention of racism or sexism the way the kids and Aang see the world is so innocent and wise its perfect at pointing out how we mess up the simplest morals in our heads and how society doesn't have control of our own perspective. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show and I would recommend everyone who wants to learn more about transcendentalism or basic human morality to watch this show.,1398038400,,1120,4.522167487684729
3453485,5,B001AI7766,"All the seasons of Avatar are very complex and thought out, but the last season Book 3 was the most suspenseful. I would give this 5 stars because of how there was a lot of emotion in this season. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in action, adventure, and a little touch of comedy and romance.
My kids' summation ......",1398038400,,337,4.365079365079365
3453486,5,B001AI7766,"I really like this series on the whole. There are some episodes that certainly seem like filler or fluff but they do a good job of tying everything back together to make it appear to contribute to character development and the overall growth of our heroes. Some of the conclusions that the characters come to *cough cough* Zuko seem a little forced. Not that I don't think he could have turned good. I just felt like the one time where his change would have seemed genuine they kept him evil.

In any event I watched these in rapid fire fashion so that I could get to the legend of Kora. I liked the young romances and felt they did a fair job on the whole on depicting the unstable nature of young love. I wish I would have gotten to see more of what was on Kotara's mind during the course of the show concerning her feelings for Ang.",1398038400,,835,4.251572327044025

A lot better than those ridiculous kid's shows that teach them being reckless.

The revised narrative was trite and derivative, the original plot was far more interesting and internally consistent.  The treatment trivialized the characters and got lost in its own CGI and forgot to maintain any depth or social relevance. The dialogue was often vapid and lacked authenticity or humor. Devotees of the cartoon series must be bitterly disappointed by this poorly adapted derivation.",1395360000,,460,5.0394736842105265

If anyone believes this show to be just for kids, they are deeply misinformed. Sit down and binge watch this show from season one. There are a couple misfires, sometimes the humor is juvenile, but as you watch the sophistication of the storytelling, the character arcs, and the grand plot line develop, you will be greatly rewarded for your patience.",1393977600,2,490,4.51685393258427

Couple weeks ago I did just that with season 1 and was immediately hooked. It's easy to see where season 3 got it's influences from, and I'm fine with that. Season 3 will always be a good season, but to me it's not as good as season 2. Still it was a very enjoyable season from start to finish. Would of love to see an epilogue, but the Legend of Korra helps with that. Still this was a good season and the end fight that it was building up to doesn't disappoint at all.",1393804800,,638,3.9921875

This is a Very well told story, BEAUTIFUL animation, cool action scenes and absolutely LOVABLE characters! And not to mention there are so many funny moments. So funny that they actually have a life of their own! But even an entertaining fantasy epic can punch you in the gut with sadness. I almost cry every time I watch an episode with a sad moment.

3453578,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar: TLA is easily the best cartoon I've ever watched.  I started watching on a whim once because the whole Avatar series was free on Amazon Prime (including the first season of the sequel, Legend of Korra).  I had heard a few good things about it and gave it a chance.  After the first few episodes of Season 1 I was hopelessly hooked.  Aang is one of the most lovable characters I've ever encountered in a show, especially in a cartoon.  Every character they introduced had a unique and interesting personality that gets developed and then contributes to the show.

I write this review as an adult who was looking for a roughly 30 minute entertaining show to watch before bed.  It turned out I'd usually watch 3-4 episodes per night because of the entertainment value.  If you're a parent this show is excellent for your kids, but if you're just watching as an adult, it's even better!  The plot itself is set up early in the first season and you know what's coming, but you don't know exactly when or how or who will be on which side, which makes the ride all the more enticing.

I don't want to throw out too many spoilers, but the end fight is pretty gratifying.  Any time the Avatar State is used I'm pretty entertained, but at the end it just seemed to put everything into perspective and wrap the series up correctly.  Season 2 has one of the saddest points I've ever seen in a cartoon with Appa in the desert.  For a comedy cartoon it definitely had me tearing up, which I didn't expect.  Again, every character feels well thought out and useful in some way.

If you haven't watched this, do it now.  You will not be disappointed ... unless you don't like good tv!",1393372800,2,1676,4.428104575163399

3453580,5,B001AI7766,"I really enjoyed this show.  It definitely is a tiny bit childish sometimes (E.g. someone saying ""I'm not a bad guy anymore, I'm good now""), but there are brains and heart behind the writing and the stories and the characters.  There aren't the normal illogical actions that characters usually have in more children-focused productions.

The artwork was good.  The romance was good.  The animation was great.  You really come to love the Avatar world by the end.  The stories behind the villain characters are also well-done.  It was great to see so much effort put there.  The humor was also surprisingly pretty good sometimes.  I loved the episode where they watched the play about themselves.  It was very entertaining and you could tell the writers had fun with it.

I find it interesting that people call this an ""anime"" and then are corrected that it isn't.  It does have the sort of ""anime"" feel in that it actually has a decent story, and the story itself seems similar to something you might see in an anime.  There is also the eastern cultural influence in some of the culture in this show.  Yes it wasn't produced in Japan, but I think the style of the show is similar enough.  Also, it was animated in Korea, and Korean cartoons get the anime title.

Anyway, regardless of linguistics, this show was great.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",1393286400,,1358,4.706382978723404

3453589,5,B001AI7766,"I chose this rating because this series is absolutely one of the best T.V. shows I have ever saw. And I don't even watch a lot of T.V. at all really.

Any way I have no bad comments about 'Avatar The Last Air Bender'. On the other hand though, I do have a lot of good comments about 'Avatar The Last Air Bender'.

For starters, I love that Aang and Katara get together at the end of the whole series. Plus, on of my favorite episodes are, Day Dreams/Nightmares. Another one of mine is when Toph, fights in the arena with the bad guys, including when Aang and Katara are in the 'Cave Of Two Lovers'!!!!Not to forget that when Katara and Zuko have a fight, and they go to get revenge for her dead mother!!!! Even though I personally think that Katara cries too much thought the series. :/

Anyway, sorry I told almost every thing on my mind about this show! But I would recommend this show to everybody again. Especially the anime/avatar fans!!! I would have to say I was totally obsessed with this show, and kind of still am!! I would even be more happier if the creators made a new series about grown-up avatar gang, to get a snoop about all the flash backs that Korra had had in her show!! Including that I would be even happier if I could meet the people who did the voices of the characters,including meeting the creators of both of the series they had made!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks so much for reading, I appreciate it ! :)",1392854400,3,1422,4.318352059925093

3453591,5,B001AI7766,"Fans rejoice!!! Because it has all the episodes of the the final season of Avatar and the quality is great. The characters are timeless, the setup is great, the action is breathtaking, the overwhelming depth and emotion flows in and out the show like a blossom in a storm. The villians are awesome, the world is beautifully drawn, and the climax is tremendous.

For those who believe this is just a kids' show will be sorely mistaken. It is family tv show that includes both kids and adults falling in love with this show. Take a shot, it will be worth it.",1392854400,,556,4.450980392156863

If anything moves, the picture gets all blurry with fuzzy lines, not like the ones that were on TV and actually okay to watch. It's still hard to watch at points. But I guess (reluctantly because there is no other option) I'd rather have an okay version copy than no copy at all.",1392422400,,379,4.277777777777778

Even though its an animated show there are a lot of life lessons.  There is action, suspense, adventure, magic (or something like it), and even romance.  I really like the ups and downs that the characters go through.  There is so much struggle going on in each of the characters roles.  A lot of the time I could relate to them and it helped me to better myself.  All in all it is a great show and I would recommend any season to any person of all ages.",1392163200,,590,4.27027027027027

3453618,4,B001AI7766,This is by far the best and most exciting of the Avatar series. It all leads up to a powerful and explosive ending befitting the fabled role of the Avatar. Of course we mustn't forget the timely and hilarious filler episodes and breaks in humor along the way.,1391817600,,259,4.416666666666667
3453619,5,B001AI7766,I saw this when it aired on nickelodeon originally and finding it here on amazon was awesome.

A fantastic last bout for Team Avatar as Aang deals with fire bending, the Day of Black Sun arrives, and Sozin's comet makes its return. Character backgrounds hit their peak in this season and each character must choose their own destiny and show their true selves. Discovering true destinies, going insane, meeting old friends, going on life-changing field trips; all these and more await you in the final season of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Its use of eastern philosophies as a plot device is fascinating to my wife and I and the overriding values represented our great for children, though in this day and age adults could stand to learn from it as well. It is highly intellectual at times, humorous often always, includes an epic conflict, and some great moral challenges for its characters - overall a fun show for everyone! The creators used a real martial artist displaying four different styles of Kung Fu to make each bending discipline look unique, and the movements are beautifully animated! Besides that, it's just a great, well written story and I highly recommend it. Each season or ""book"" includes all the special features from the individual disc releases as well as some extras on a specially devoted Extras disc.

3453688,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar The Last Airbender isn't just a cartoon, or a show meant for kids. It's an experience that showcases friendship, courage, the difference between right and wrong, and just about every other moral-based theme. Never before has anything like this show ever aired on television, and nothing like it will ever happen again (Korra is amazing, but it's not the same). Book 3: Fire, showcases the epic finale of Aang having to face Firelord Ozai, as Sozin's comet is approaching with every passing day. Overcoming various obstacles, defeat and acquiring a new friend from the unlikeliest of places, the group then set off to save the world from fire, ready to bring about a new era of peace and prosperity.

This TV series is pretty much The Lord of the Rings in animated form. The same themes are here (including a love theme), the action sequences are a marvel to be witnessed (being even better than most movies with action scenes), the drama escalates to emotional, tear-jerking moments, and the witty comedy helps to balance the serious overtones. Book 3 could not have gone any better, and when the finale does happen, you are in total awe of the spectacle the creators had in store. Now, even though some people do see this as just another cartoon series that aired on TV, they're completely wrong. Not everyone makes movies just for money, or for entertainment purposes. Films and TV shows sometimes carry deep messages that resonate within ourselves. Like how the Lord of the Rings re-shaped the ""epic film"" genre, Avatar: The Last Airbender completely re-shaped animated television shows. I just hope, in time, someone remakes the live-action film. I want to see Peter Jackson make it because, he could make a film trilogy that could live up to The Last Airbender name. And just because the show was centered to the kids audience, that doesn't mean the film can't be two and a half hours long or more. I'm just eternally grateful for this series; it was an important part in my life, and watching it through to the end always brings tears to my eyes.

Please do not judge the series on the movie version (which was terrible). This series is so much better and the movie does not do it justice.

We see more how he became who is is and the internal struggle he faces trying to decipher right from wrong.  We also get a really good look at the Fire Lord and while he is pretty much one dimensional, he at least has good hair - LOL!  There are the inevitable things where you want to tell you kids or grand kids, ""don't try this at home, but mostly the message of that peace is its own reward comes through despite the fact that these kids are always having to fight their way to prove it.

Can't always rely on the Internet or Nick reruns when you get the urge to watch major elemental action.

As far as the series in general goes, it's a smart, well-acted, beautiful, funny, exciting, adventurous tale with great character development.

3453733,4,B001AI7766,"I finished the season a few years ago and I'm still upset by the ending.
I'm a hardcore Zutarian. Kataang makes no sense whatsoever, and I'm greatly upset by it. I have a long rant on the subject so please try to stay with me.
First of all, Katara and Aang have a mother/son or brother/sister relationship. Aang would probably drive Katara nuts after a while too. Aunt Wu also didn't foresee any love in Aang's future. His Avatar duties would also probably not give him the time to raise a family. Katara needs someone who would give her a deep love and lots of attention, not just the result of a schoolboy crush.
In Legend of Korra, the pair have 3 children: Bumi (non-bender), Kya(waterbender), and Tenzin (airbender). Anyone who has read up on Avatar trivia knows that the Air Nomads are the only nation to have children that are ALL Air Nomads. Are Kya and Bumi Air Nomads? No, I don't think so. Kya and Bumi  also seem to feel resentment towards Aang because Aang obviously favored Tenzin. I have a theory on this as well, but I'll elaborate on that perhaps another time.
Zutara makes sense because they have stuff in common. They both know what it is like to lose their moms. Katara is stubborn at times, and Aang would not be able to reign her in. Zuko knows how to handle strong women (namely Azula). Katara is very serious, as is Zuko. She would get annoyed by optimists and jokesters because Katara is a realist. Aang is inclined to avoid arguements, but healthy relationships need them. Zuko's not afraid of getting his opinion out there. Katara needs someone who will be open and honest. Katara is good at seeing beauty in everyone and Zuko needs that esteem boost. They both need love, and they could give it to each other.
Zuko is good with kids. He's displayed that quality. He would take parenting seriously, but Aang might only see kids as playthings.
In other words, ZUKO AND KATARA NEED EACH OTHER. I'm done.
Read Continuum by Psalm 136 on Fanfiction.net if you need a good Zutara fic to read.",1387238400,,2013,4.53021978021978

This show is FAR better than it ever needed to be, and it has some of the best characters and stories of any show, live action or animated, and it appeals to all ages.  Great writing, heartfelt character moments, humor, gorgeous animation, and great themes.  This show is a joy to watch, and despite a few minor hiccups in season 3, this is still one of the best series I have ever seen.

This is where Aang finds all his mojo, and faces off with the Firelord Ozi. This is where Prince Zuko faces his crazy sister.

Book 3 fire is not just awesome and amazing but it's also epic. I found that all of our characters were tested and we got to see. New sides to these characters. Overall I gave this book a 5/5 stars. I'm sad it's over but we do have the legend of korra so I'm happy it ended on a beautiful note for everyone.

You can absolutely tell how far the developing and creative team behind Avatar had come from where they started, just by watching this book. The animation is superb.

You can tell that everyone involved with making this show must have really enjoyed and believed in this series, because it really felt like a polished film franchise more than a 'silly' kids show.  As a twenty-something post-grad, I initially thought it seemed too immature, until most of my friends recommended it and its sequel series Korra as must-see television.  Really too bad that M. Knight destroyed the film version of the show, as there is such a neat mythos to this universe that it would have been great to see it all in live action as well, but fortunately the animation does a terrific job of conveying everything so you never feel as if you are watching ""just a kids show.""",1380585600,,811,4.618055555555555

3453824,5,B001AI7766,Recommended for all ages. Teaches great life lessons. Is beautiful and haunting and action-packed. Can't wait for the kids to be a little older so we can watch together (my third time).,1380067200,2,185,4.8125
3453825,5,B001AI7766,"I am 46 years old and began watching the series with my kids and at first, I really thought it was just ok, but as I immersed myself into the show I found it to be fantastic.  Not only is it a positive message of nonviolence, it also demonstrates the need to be strong and that violence is necessary at times, but restraint must be used.  It's funny and thoughtful.  I loved it!",1380067200,3,378,4.1506849315068495
3453826,4,B001AI7766,"The third season of Avatar is not as good as previous seasons. You would expect the final season to be more tense and dramatic than the previous seasons but due to the filler like material of many of the episodes, it's not. Katara takes a backseat in the last season to make way for more of Zuko time. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to watch and there are a few episodes that shine. (The invasion episode, the prison episode, the episode with katara and her mother's killer, and the final episode)",1380067200,,497,4.533333333333333

3453829,5,B001AI7766,"I love the story flow and the morals this story teaches.  I have seen all three seasons at least 6 times!!!!!  I see something new each time! I truly believe this a wonderful series to teach young people the realities of life how evil will not win in the end and good works and how faith, love and kindless can prevail.

I just love the characters personalities!  I have parrots.  I have named my macaw ZuZu, another one is Kitara and my cockatoo is named Kiah (Kitara's mom).",1379980800,3,476,4.363636363636363

3453833,5,B001AI7766,I'm glad a friend urged me to watch this series. I was reluctant but became hooked and it goes down as one of my all-time favorite series ever. Season 3 is the perfect conclusion to the story with one of the greatest finales in animated history.,1379462400,,245,4.3478260869565215
3453834,5,B001AI7766,I'm a huge fan of Avatar I now I was finally able to buy Book 3. This series is awesome and the final book gives an equally awesome ending to the series. I really REALLY wanted the series to continue but the final confrontation between Aang and the fire lord is a most see. Highly recommend this.,1379462400,,296,4.2105263157894735

3453843,4,B001AI7766,Although predictable the characters are likable. Most every episode has a moral lesson and it can be a good show to watch with your children. It is not at all related to the avatar movie.,1379116800,,187,4.371428571428571
3453844,5,B001AI7766,Love this series. Also the new show the legend of korra is great aswell. I wish there were more seasons,1379030400,,103,4.2

3453851,5,B001AI7766,I love this show and the dvd transfer is great! I just love the final fight between Aang and Ozai because it shows just how powerful the 12 year old Aang is.,1378339200,,157,3.9375

3453855,5,B001AI7766,"Warning: the DVDs are region specific, but the US should not have any issues.

As the climax of the show Book 3 pulls out all the stops.  It is a true culmination of everything that has build up over the first two books.  As a whole the series builds up to this peak and it honestly holds you there, with a powerful Four-part Finale.

In my opinion Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best family shows that has been made in the early 2000's and even since then.  Anyone can honestly enjoy this series.  To explain more would  take too long to put to words, it is something that simply needs to be experienced for yourself.",1377993600,,628,4.271186440677966
3453856,5,B001AI7766,Exactly what I wanted in a tv show. It is always exciting to watch because they have a new adventure to go on every day. The finale of this season is extremely good and I could watch it over and over!,1377820800,2,200,3.902439024390244
3453857,5,B001AI7766,The connections between storylines are very compelling in this series. The mythology and culture of the four nations is well developed. Please get The Legend of Korra soon!,1377820800,,172,5.178571428571429

3453859,5,B001AI7766,Have been a fan of this show the day it came out. Glad now I have a copy of the series to watch any episode when ever I want commercial free. It may seem like a kid show being that its from Nick but its really a show for all ages.,1377734400,,230,3.5294117647058822
3453860,5,B001AI7766,I have 3 little ones all under the age of 5 and they love this show. They have watched every episode twice. If there was one thing I would like to see done with this show is there to be more episodes.,1377734400,,200,3.7857142857142856

3453863,5,B001AI7766,Great show with great character development.  Season three ties the entire series together as well as more easter eggs that have existed during the entire series.,1377734400,,162,5.230769230769231
3453864,4,B001AI7766,good show I like the action and interplay of the elements and the spirits and their legends. Kinda funny too,1377734400,,108,4.45

3453866,5,B001AI7766,for kids and parents this is a good show that has some good stories built in the plots. I reccommend,1377734400,,100,4.05
3453867,5,B001AI7766,"Season three is, in my opinion, by far the strongest and most satisfying of the three seasons. Considering how good the show is to begin with, that is saying something. My favorite episodes are all here, The Beach, The Day of Black Sun, The Western Air Temple, and The Ember Island Players.  The finale is amazing.  The only complaint about Avatar I can think of is that is there just not enough of it.  However, having a set ending is part of what makes the show so great.  This show is hands down one of the best shows I ever watched, animated or not, and is greatly satisfying even as an adult.  Don't skip or underestimate this show, it is one of the best of all time.",1377561600,,672,4.25984251968504

3453873,5,B001AI7766,"One of the things I love about Avatar: The Last Airbender is that it has a very definite arc. While I would love to spend more time with these characters (in this time period; yes, I know about Legend of Korra), it's all too common for a good series to be stretched out too long and overstay its welcome. The characters remain lovable and dynamic, the humor is still pretty good, and the Fire Nation finally gets some quality time in the spotlight.",1377216000,,448,4.409638554216867
3453874,5,B001AI7766,"The whole series starts out a little slow but after the 3rd episode in the 1st season, it turns into the best cartoon ever.  This 3rd season crowns the whole series with epic battles and an epic story.",1377043200,,201,4.2894736842105265

3453882,3,B001AI7766,"I ordered all the book collections out of impulse without checking that none of the episodes were in widescreen.
With some research, the series was made for TV and is only available in fullscreen format (which suuuucks).

All my discs work, but the case itself is very cheap; both the case and the case sleeve feel like they're made out of cheap thin postcards, and the plastic materials made to hold the discs are barely glued at the corners.

I recommend buying spare DVD cases to store your discs in and put the original case on the shelf to look and don't touch.",1376870400,,566,4.485436893203883
3453883,5,B001AI7766,"Season 3 is the best of the trilogy... although you need the first 2 to appreciate this one. The Character development arcs of the supporting cast are deep, complicated and make sense! I love Zuko! Aang is still the optimistic youth, but a budding maturity is apparent in his thought process.

Masterful storytelling!",1376870400,,317,4.981132075471698

3453888,5,B001AI7766,What a great ending to a great series! I wish we could have seen more battle scenes like Aang's battle with Ozai. It felt like I was watching DBZ all over again.

3453890,5,B001AI7766,"This original series is great for the entire family.  We loved every minute of the adventures of Aang and his friends who must fight the Fire Nation and save the world. It is a classic story of good versus evil, but spun up from an imaginary world where the heroes can bend fire, water, earth, and air.  Even the adults will be wondering if Aang can complete his mission to fight the Fire Lord and win back the world from his tyrannical rule.",1376352000,,442,4.313253012048193

The only reason I am giving this 3 stars as opposed to 5 is the fact that Amazon streaming video quality is very sporadic. For this particular show, the picture quality is poor and very pixilated. The resolution looks a little better when on windowed mode, but it looks simply atrocious on a full picture mode.

What makes it a five star rating though is that I don't really mind them re-watching it.  It is entertaining, funny, and has a good storyline.  I like the fact that it actually finished the story instead of trying to drag the audience into unneeded extra seasons.

Plus, the action does not disappoint - they do such a good job with animating the movements of all the benders that sometimes I think I can water bend or earth bend myself if I just get the movements right!

3453955,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar the last airbender is hands down one of the best shows on television. Whether you're a kid, an adult, or anything in between its just a fantastic show with its own animation style, excellent characters, and story that keep you involved throughout from season 1 through 3. There are plenty of reviews on the previous seasons and how great they are, and season 3 really brings it all together by tying up plotlines and opening up new ones to give you a satisfying season finale that brings it all together.

The writers on this show had a vision for how and where things would go and it shows with the great character development, plotline twists, and just heartwarming yet real moments you have throughout the season. It's a must watch for fans, and for newcomers I highly encourage you to watch the show from start to finish. Don't dismiss this as a kids show because there are some very serious undertones that will let someone older enjoy the show just as much as someone younger will. It might not be for the very little kids, but once they can start understanding things a bit it'll work great for them. It teaches a lot of very positive lessons too which I'm sure parents will like if they're enjoying it with their kids.",1371081600,,1233,4.554054054054054

The character arcs were related to the main story and their tie in was not, in most cases and in my opinion, superfluous or just a filler episode.  I specially liked that the hero/protagonist was always trying to solve what he encountered.  Not to say there aren't fight scenes or action but there was enough spent on the moral aspect of his choices that it presented more realistically.  It is not a world of white and black and this, though a cartoon, depicted that well.",1370736000,,585,4.650485436893204

The last 3 episodes of this entire saga (obviously they were in Season 3)  were  the best - if you'd never seen any of the Avatar seasons...you can start with this one (in my humble opinion, it can stand alone).  The series as a whole demonstrates wit, adventure, innocence, loyalty, the bonds of family that can play pivot roles in choices & destinies, the burdens & benefits of power, and the strengths that friendship (though they may come from unexpected places).

Though I don't have kids and I started watching these episodes online in my 30s, the season I always return to is Season 3 - especially the last 2-3 episodes....simply because they're epic!",1370649600,,713,4.672
3453959,5,B001AI7766,"After a rough battle against Azula, Aang faces his biggest challenges of all; mastering firebending, and bringing down Fire Lord Ozai. But first Aang must find someone to become his firebending teacher, and he must find the Fire Lord before the comet reaches Earth, bringing devastation to the nations. Let's back up for a minute, though, and remind ourselves what show we're watching, shall we?

In this world, people known as benders have the ability to control one of the four elements. The Avatar, a living manifestation of the spirit of the Earth, has the ability to control all four elements, and has the duty of keeping the balance between all benders. As stated in the intro, the four nations (Air Nomads, Fire Nation, the Northern and Southern Water Tribes, and the Earth Kingdom) once all lived in harmony. The ambitious Fire Lord Sozin launced an attack on the other nations, and just when the world truly needed the Avatar, he vanished from existence. One hundred years have passed and two Water Tribe siblings (Katara, the last waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe, and her brother Sokka, a non-bender) discover and awaken the long missing Avatar, a twelve year old airbender named Aang, and his flying sky-bison, Appa.

In the time Aang has been dormant, the Fire Nation have continued their campaign to rule over all nations. All Southern waterbenders aside from Katara have been killed or incarcerated; a large amount of the Earth Kingdom has been occupied by their forces; and due to the now deceased Sozin knowing that the next Avatar was destined to be an airbender, the Air Nomads have been completely wiped out, leaving Aang the last of his kind. He has no time to grieve though, because an event known as Sozin's Comet is soon going to pass by the land. The firebenders are going to harness the power from this comet to make their final strike and officially be in control of all nations. Aang must master the other three elements and defeat the current Fire Lord, Ozai.

In this volume, Aang must recover from his near fatal wound he sustained during the coup of Ba Sing Se. Even more troubling, though, is that Aang still has yet to master the art of firebending. Still believing that no good can come from the most dangerous form of bending, Aang is apprehensive to give it a try again, even though it is necessary to defeat Ozai. He finds an unlikely ally in Zuko, who is now determined to take down his father and sister and take his place on the throne, so that he may clear his name and return the Fire Nation to the peaceful place it once was. With the return of some familiar faces, the Gaang goes from four determined but ill prepared teens to a rag tag group of talented rebels determined to mend their world. Meanwhile, Ozai and Azula continue to grow stronger by the day. But just because the building is sturdy does not mean there are not cracks in the foundation.

The special features in this volume are creator commentary, a Book 3 pencil test animation, Into the Fire Nation at SDCC, and a Women of Avatar featurette.

And so this beloved series comes to an end! Looking back to the first appearances of each of these characters, you really see the character development shining through in this volume. Characters like Zuko have had complete turnarounds since their first appearances, and it is quite a sight to see something like Katara threatening the life of a Fire Nation citizen, or Zuko successfully redirecting lightning. It's almost like having a child grow up, seeing how far your favorite characters have come!

And thus, Avatar is finished. Delayed or not, at least we have Korra!",1370563200,,3634,4.71496062992126

I watched it myself and then watched it again with my five year old son. There's a lot of animated fighting but an overall good message in the show. If you saw ""The last air bender"" movie, I feel bad for you. That movie may have the same characters in it, but in no way is that movie a representation of this series. If you enjoy this series, ""the legend of Korra"" takes place in the same universe in the future where Korra is the next avatar.

3453967,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is unparalleled.  Although it aired on Nickelodeon, which is ostensibly a network for children, it is not by any means a show for children alone.  Avatar contains mature themes, a compelling narrative, superb acting, and serious emotional weight.  It has now been about 6 years since the show ended, and eight since it began.  Avatar affected me deeply in my formative years, and now, when I am beyond its targeted age group, I find that the series is only better than it was when I watched it in my early teens and pre-teens, as I can more fully appreciate the depth of the world and characters.  More than any other series that I have ever watched or heard about, Avatar: The Last Airbender fulfills its promises to its viewers; promises which include, above all else, a superb viewing experience.

  There is nobody too old, or too young, to appreciate this series, as it transcends the stigma attached to conventional cartoons.  The central characteristic of the show is not the ability to shoot fire and lightning, lift mountains, create tidal surges or fly, but its characters and world.  In this aspect, it fully realizes its potential (and, I believe, the potential of all stories, no matter the medium), and this to a far greater extent than many other shows, movies, or books that are popular today.  Avatar: The Last Airbender is a show that will warm the heart and soul, which effectively immerses viewers in a strange, but strangely familiar, world, and which brings with it a strong cathartic end to each episode, character arc, and, of course, the series itself.",1370131200,,1604,4.817518248175182

3454012,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar the Last Airbender has been a show our whole  family has loved, from the series to the movie.  Season 3 continues the adventure, bringing the story to a very intense ending with the final fight between Ang and the Fire Lord.  Each episode gets a bit more intense with the hope that they don't get caught while living in the Fire Nation and planning to attack when the Fire Nation will be at their weakest, during the time of the eclipse.  Season 3 deepens the character and maturity of each character in the story as they continue to hone their skills and learn who they are and what they believe in.  They each go through their own inner struggle, all while trying to evade the Fire Nation.
Our kids have watched all three seasons several times and never seem to tire of them.  They pretend to be able to bend the elements and mimic the different motions that the characters use.  Long conversations imagining  being able to bend an element, and which one we'd want to be able to manipulate have been had in our home.  This series has definitely opened our imaginations. The series does depict violence. They're trying to overthrow the Fire Nation, who  have wreaked havoc on the world.  But I think that they do try to show the difference between fighting to bring people down and fighting to lift them up and empower them. You  come to love each character, each unique personality.
Overall, this is  a great series  and I definitely recommend it.",1363478400,,1456,4.571428571428571

They are dramatic and have a great storyline and also have very funny parts.  As an adult and having watched the film release of this series(which I enjoyed but my 12 yr old hated), I understand why kids like the series better than the film.....there are alot more details and it is much funnier (light humor---nothing crude that I have seen in series at all)...

I would recommend it to any anime fan as well as the younger generation. It has life lessons that just carries a positive feel through the whole series.

3454042,5,B001AI7766,"I've had a few successes with anime in the past, but have recently followed a whole string of failures, it seems. I just finished watching all of Avatar:The Last Airbender, though, and it is by far my favorite anime series ever. Don't let the fact that it's American-produced anime tarnish your willingness to watch this amazing series, because this show accomplishes a lot where even Asian-produced shows fall flat. Here's a few example how.

DEPTH OF CHARACTERS: This is a deal-breaker for any story for me, but this show passes with flying colors. The characters are great right out of the box, but over the course of the series, the writers were able to squeeze a massive amount of development and pathos out of each one without ever getting too heavy or depressing. Also, the relationships that grow between the characters evolve organically and rarely seem forced.

SOLID STORYTELLING: The individual episodes are tight. The series as a whole had a pre-determined beginning, middle, and end and was obviously well-planned, so there is little to no dead weight in the storytelling. Each episode serves to enhance the last and move the plot forward. It's refreshing to see a studio project like this not afraid to have a full concept planned going in and not allow themselves to be bullied by execs to stretch out stories unnecessarily with a lot of superfluous plot twists and loose ends just to pick up ratings and beef up their toy line.

VISUAL DETAILS: The art is beautiful and I can't say enough about how great it looks. The scenery is spectacular and rich with detail. The artists weren't slavish to character design, either; just as the characters change throughout the series, the artists weren't afraid to change their designs periodically to suit the story's needs. The use of CGI is judicious and tasteful and, while noticeable next to the traditional animation, it isn't distracting.

Anyway, I could go on and on, but if you made it this far, why don't you just go and watch it? If you're not hooked after the 3rd episode, you're obviously in a coma.",1358812800,6,2069,4.819718309859155

3454055,5,B001AI7766,"Avatar season 3 continues to be fun and great in every way. Humor, fighting, character development, insights to the world's culture, other Avatar's personalities, more of Zuko and Iroh's stories. One great finale. This show really finished off with a bang, almost literally.

Still out of all three seasons this one posses many obvious flaws compared to the others. More episodes feel like filler ones, more focus spent on action (athough it was to be expected, 3rd acts generally do that), Azula's maddness seems to be put there just for the sake of doing it. The fire lord didn't feel so menacing after they showed his face, I feel they should've waited untill either Zuko left or the first part of the finale. Finally everyone's bending seems to have gotten abnormally better after just two months or so and they are doing things I think are unatural (Where Katara freezes Azula but can still move and Azula's lighting levitation).

That being said while season 3 is the worst season critique wise, the show remained just as good and fun to watch and I rank it as #2 for likability (Earth's first). It was lots of fun watching this show. One of the few chartoons that actually will be remembered well beyond it's years.",1356825600,,1222,4.732394366197183

But it all comes to a head here, as the finest animated series ever produced for American TV does what so few shows ever do: Gets the ending right.  Plenty of thrills, laughter and tears, and awesomeness by the bucketload.  (Blood bending!)

The transfer is fine (though seriously, when can we see these on Blu-ray?), but where this set really shines is in the extras, especially the almost non-stop commentaries from series creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who really help you understand just how much effort went into every story point and visual detail.  These guys are clearly happy to be doing what they do, and it's both fun and instructive to share their enthusiasm.

Now, when will we be getting a high-def transfer of ""Legend Of Korra""?",1355184000,,872,4.858108108108108

This is the third and final season which contincludes the journey of Aang and friends through the fire kingdom (hence Book 3: Fire), always getting closer to and finally showing the epic final encounter with the Fire Lord.
Be sure to watch the episodes, and seasons for that matter, in order as they do tell a story from beginning to end, not like some cartoons where you can just pick up anywhere. Although you could do that too, but characters from early on are referenced in later episodes and the show makes some ""in"" jokes you may not catch, and therefore not fully enjoy if you skip ahead. I fully recommend this to children and adults.

Even if you don't like animation as such, remember:  It is a medium not a genre. You do yourself a disservice by skipping this one.",1355097600,,868,4.509554140127388

3454072,5,B001AI7766,"This series is simply incredible. The concept of being able to manipulate natural elements and use them in combat using martial art forms is really cool. Just in case anyone is wondering, my sister is a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I watched the series with her, she said the actual forms used to bend are real forms mostly inspired by animals. While its on Nickelodeon, don't write it off as just another kid's show. While Sokka can provide some (rather hilarious) comic relief and of course it is kid friendly (noone gets killed) this series also explores deeper darker themes of self-sacrifice, putting others before self, and the harsh realities of war. The combat sequences are gorgeous and wonderfully coreographed, it just never fails to impress me to watch pillars of water being shot everywhere and towering infernos barreling down on places or people. The story is eloquently written and the balance of characters is perfect. We have psychotic power hungry characters, anti-heros, those who choose to remain neutral, and the pure of heart.

3454080,3,B001AI7766,"There's more than enough reviews to show why A:TLA is such an awesome series. However, I'm only here to tell you how I feel about the DVD collection itself.

I honestly feel that this compilation set isn't up to par with standard DVDs. The picture and audio transfer is sloppy; the quality is just bad. There are moments when the smooth animation breaks into digitized lines, as if a bad internet stream. The audio doesn't seem to be mastered quite well. It's okay, but it registers in a tinny area.

I really dislike the fact that it takes forever to skip the Nickelodeon advertisements for every disc. The chapter selection is very basic--separating only episodes. You can't jump past the opening intro, or even halfway into an episode, making it difficult to resume a chapter or find favorite spots. I also can't believe there are no subtitles at all.

The quality along with missing a lot of basic features for a DVD these days, it's nearly a deal breaker for me. I've been longing to own this series, and there's still no word of a blu-ray release. If it weren't for the great deal that I got for the set(s), then I would have returned them in a heartbeat.",1345161600,11,1161,4.545454545454546

The story is completley appropraite for children but it has a deep, mature theme and deals with some pretty heavy material. It's not like one of those stupid shows where the biggest problem is that someone doesn't have a dress to wear to the prom. This is real,and thrilling, and right at your face. There'es a war and there's benders, it has one of the most creative plots ever. It's so good you won't be able to put it down. The martial arts and bending is so amazing! this is one of the best shows ever and it has a good message and lesson. Plus you get to learn so much sbout Asian culture and the soundtracks are great. Wih tons of action,suspense,humor,thrill,and romance, I definetly reccomend you watch it!

3454098,4,B001AI7766,"** THIS REVIEW IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ""EMBER ISLAND PLAYERS"" EPISODE! **
** I did not know at the time which I wrote this that Amazon was going to include it with the overall Season 3 reviews, so I apologize for any confusion. **

I realize that the airing of this episode pre-dates the premier of the Shyamalan film, but I couldn't help but see this episode as a mockery of the Last Airbender movie; the main characters in the play were white kids, the acting was terrible and over-dramatic, some of the names were mispronounced, Sokka takes issue with the actor portraying him in the play as too serious ... even the design of the poster for the play (which they make a point to clearly show us early in the episode) looks suspiciously like some of the promotional posters for the Shyamalan film, especially the DVD/Blu-ray release cover. At the end when they are leaving and everybody is complaining about the play, Sokka says ""At least the effects were good!""

The film was in-production while this episode was in production, so maybe the writers of the show saw some of the footage and decided to address it? Even if that's not the case: I enjoyed this episode for that reason alone; I had just seen the (terrible) Shyamalan movie, and was inclined to see this as the creators of the show mocking Shyamalan's terrible direction, and butchering of their vision.

I don't really think there are any bad episodes in this series, and though this particular episode seemed a little out-of-place, I think it was a valid and cohesive stylistic choice to give viewers some light-hearted mirth before the philosophically-dense, action-packed, and emotionally-intense final chapter. I also think that certain parts of the play -- especially the outcome -- were important to remind viewers of Aang's self-doubt before facing Ozai. Yeah, it was cheesy, but it was in such stark contrast in so many ways to the finale that it was well-placed, and even enhanced the conclusion of such a fantastic series.",1334707200,8,1996,4.796511627906977

When people long for the good old days of movies, television or even storytelling in general and they say that the best is behind us, point them to this series and rest assured that all such longing will be erased.

3454121,5,B001AI7766,"Another kid's cartoon on Nickelodeon, it probably won't be that great right?  This was the original thought brought out by many people when Avatar first aired on Nickelodeon, not giving the show much of a thought.  As it continued to progress, however, more and more of the population began to realize the true depth of the show.  Clearly this was not just a show for children. In fact, as the show progressed through the first and second books, there were messages and symbols that were more directed at young adults, possibly even adults themselves!

What made the show such a success was the excellent story telling, given it a simple idea yet complex plot.  The characters were well developed throughout and continue to reach their different destinies or wrestle with their own inner struggles.  The show continued to peak until it's climatic final four episodes, giving the viewers an incredible ending that they were waiting for!

I would highly recommend this show to everyone!  Seeing as this book is the third in a trilogy series, I would begin with Book 1: Water and then Book 2: Earth, otherwise you would not understand the whole expanse of the story.  As I said before, the show is not directed only at children.  Adults can appreciate the rich development of plot and characters and the underlying meaning presented.

In this box set, you receive all 22 twenty minute episodes in Book 3: Fire on 4 discs, including a 5th disc with a few special features and commentaries.  The discs run very smooth, having excellent quality to both picture and sound.  The price is right also, dropping to roughly $20 plus shipping.

So, if you're looking for a great show that's both afforadable and captivating, I would purchase this set!  Start with the first two books and move up to here, you will not be disappointed!",1314144000,,1821,4.791666666666667

3454125,5,B001AI7766,"I was first introduced to Avatar: The Last Airbender by seeing the less-than-stellar live action movie (I did like many parts of it, but there were just some things that I couldn't enjoy). Despite that movie's deficiencies, I was very curious and started catching episodes on television. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode that I saw and found the series to be fun, hilarious, full of heart, of very high quality, and very mature for a children's series (while still being very appropriate for children). So I decided that I'd rather see all of the episodes in order and ordered the first season. I wasn't delighted to see how well the series flowed and how wonderful the character development is and ordered the second season as well, which is probably my favorite of the three.

The third season offers a set of truly wonderful episodes. There are a couple of episodes that went in some different directions that some people might not enjoy but that I found very interesting. Overall, it continues to bring the high quality of art, story, direction, voice talent, and character development from the first two seasons. It is a heartwarming and complex series that comes to an excellent and exciting conclusion in this set.

I would definitely recommend this to any child or adult. It is one of my favorite television series and this set does bring it to a great end.",1306886400,,1367,4.788135593220339

3454127,3,B001AI7766,"Just finished the series a couple days ago and man.... what happened? The ""writing benders"" are there because some of the stuff from the second season, and the first half of this season was alright, maybe even great, but man those last 4 episodes. ...

What bothered me the most about the last few episodes was how they gave little to no payoff to things that had been built up previously. Like the whole thing with Zuko's mother? I had almost forgot that was a plot point until Zuko asked about it in the last episode's last five minutes, and once he did, all it did was make me ask the same question. ""Oh yea.... What DID happen to Zuko's mother?""

Then there was Sokka's space sword of greatness and the training that he received which encompassed an entire episode, and what did that culminate in? Him throwing his space sword to cut a board and cause ONE soldier to fall to his death? That's it? He could've done that with the boomerang he had for the entire series.

Oh man, and don't even get me started on the Lion Turtle thing that CONVENIENTLY gave Aang the one power he would need to defeat the fire lord the frickin day before he was supposed to fight him. Not only is that lazy plotting by itself, but it also basically negates all the training and mastering of the other elements and him being the avatar, because all he needed the whole time was this unnamed power from a character that appears in the last episode of the series.

Another problem I had with the lion turtle thing was that it literally had no explanation to it. It could've worked if they said it was a spirit, since they established the existance of the spirit world in the first and second seasons, but no. They actually go out of their way to explain that this isn't a spirit and then even farther out of their way to make sure it isn't explained at all.

It just felt like they went out of their way to give us ZERO payoff to any of the stuff they'd built up over the rest of the series. Some examples? Ba Sing Se basically took half of season 2 to be captured, whereas it's liberated in about 2 minutes in the last episode. Aang was training the whole series to be the Avatar, and at the end, it wasn't even the avatar state that won the day.

I dunno, maybe I was expecting this series to be more consistant but at the end of the day, it feels like they forgot everything they'd previously wrote in the past two seasons and just kinda winged the finale.",1306281600,3,2440,4.3050108932461875

The stories are excellent, creative, inventive, unpredictable, funny, serious and tie together very well. I've never owned any show that I've loved so much and is so endearing.  The messages of this show are very wholesome.  My family stayed up until midnight to finish the last book.

-Aang is a fun-loving 12 yr old that is destined to save the world. He learns a lot about life and love along the way and he still is able to hang onto his values.
-Sokka is hands down my favorite character. His sarcasm and silliness makes the story flow and interesting.

The characters are more mature, Zuko has finally realized his true destiny, and the big fight between Aang and the Phoenix King is right around the corner. When I was watching the last four episodes I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I think that battle was one of the best things I've ever seen.

As ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" draws to a close in its third season, it shows itself to be such a work.

Though Aang, Katara, and Zuko are the most dynamic characters, everyone gets enough screentime, and the plot threads so carefully woven over the previous two seasons come to fruition. In the final moments of Book 3, there is a feeling that washes over you. The only way I can describe this feeling is Poignancy.

3454157,4,B001AI7766,"The Book 3 Collection for Avatar: The Last Airbender has the final twenty-one episodes of the series on four discs, and a fifth disc in the set contains some bonus material.  These episodes finally bring about the end of Aang's story; however, in my opinion, there are several ""filler"" episodes at the beginning of this set.  And since there was a bit of ""filler"" earlier on, it forced the change that happens to Zuko to be a little more rushed than it should have been.  Overall, though, I am happy with how the series ended.

On the first disc of the set, there is audio commentary for the episodes ""Sokka's Master"" and ""The Beach.""  On the second disc, there is audio commentary for ""The Avatar and the Firelord"" and ""The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion.""  The third disc contains audio commentary for ""The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse"" and ""The Western Air Temple.""  And the final disc has audio commentary on all six of the episodes included on it.

The bonus disc contains three special features.  The first is labeled as ""The Women of Avatar: The Last Airbender.""  While I appreciate the thought and the intent of this feature, I think the actual execution could have been done better.  The second extra is ""Book 3 Final Pencul Test Animation.""  The final extra is ""Into the Fire Nation,"" which is from the Avatar: The Last Airbender panel at the 2007 San Diego ComiCon.  In some respects, I thought these bonus features weren't as strong as the bonuses that were included on the Book 1 and Book 2 collections.

This is the last and final season of Avatar and they did a great job of wrapping it up nicely. There is twist at the end that you may not expect. The character developement is excellent.

3454172,5,B001AI7766,"*(minor) SPOILER ALERT!*

Avatar: The Last Airbender comes to an explosive conclusion in Book 3: Fire.  (I seriously suggest you watch Books One and Two if you haven't yet, this is NOT a season to watch without seeing other episodes.  I kindly recommend you stop reading now and look up book one).  The series gets darker and more action packed than ever as Aang and his friends struggle to defeat Firelord Ozai before the powerful Sozin's Comet returns.

Compared to the other two seasons, book three is much more intense.  It's still kid friendly with good morals and fun laughs, but the action keeps coming and coming.  But it's not just a bunch of people riding flying bisons and flinging fireballs.  The show gets really deep at times, now more than ever.  Issues within as well as external are explored as characters search through their feelings, tragic backstories are revealed and terrifying enemies are encountered.  Feelings of love and romance are also flying around in the shadow of battles.  At first it was just Zuko trying to capture Aang to regain his honor.  Then it was Azula trying to capture Aang, who is a little more intense with her firebending.  Now they've got a crazy, nameless bald guy who can firebend with his mind and he's shooting to kill.

The characters have developed considerably and they deal with a good bit of drama in this season.  Three years of airtime (one year by the show's timeline) has matured the characters.  Everyone is a little more serious, a little wiser (or crazier).  Zuko's anger is now directed at himself rather than others as he tries to find his purpose.  Aang is struggling with feeling guilty over times he messed up big and tries to have the mindset to stop (as in kill) Ozai by ANY means necessary.  Katara gets a lesson in revenge and forgiveness.  Sokka still keeps the corny jokes coming, but he's become a good leader.  On and on.  The lessons that appear in daily episodes haven't stopped coming, they just come in more dramatic and serious situations in this season.

This description is probably making it sound like a soap opera with bending powers, so I will point out that comedy is still widely employed in this show.  There are plenty of silly moments and kid jokes and happy endings.  There's just a lot of danger and drama thrown into the mix....

The twists and turns and fireworks continue to the inevitable battle between Aang and Ozai that has built up for three seasons (who didn't see it coming?) and the ending is pretty surprising.

There is one episode in this season which is slightly scary.  I hate to ruin the surprise, but in the episode the group encounters a woman who discovered how to bend blood and she bends it maliciously.  While no actual blood is seen, the concept is probably the most intense thing covered on the show.  This is still a show suitable for kids, but this shows just how mature it's gotten.  Parents that are reading this for their kids, don't let this scare you away.  This is as bad as it gets and it's not that bad, but it is slightly scary.

This show is very suspenseful and explores issues in a way that it can be enjoyable by any age and don't let the fact that it's a kid's show tell you otherwise!  I'm a 20-year-old college student and I think it's brilliant.  I think the show matured season-by-season to appeal to the target audience (kids and teens) as they grew up.  This can be for kids as young as, say, seven or eight, (any younger is ok but all they'll see are fireballs and martial arts) and for adults as old as they come.  The voice acting is very good, the story is exciting and the animation is really colorful and, well, animated.  I will note that of the three seasons Book Three imitates japanese-anime styles the most, usually in a silly moment like when Aang has nightmares about facing Ozai and discovers he forgot to wear his pants.

This cartoon series is one for the ages.  Book Three is by far the best of the three seasons in what I think is one of the best adventure stories ever written.  It really is like a book; I tried to watch one or two episodes at a time but like a good book I couldn't put it down, or rather I couldn't stop watching.  I had to know what happened next.  The story of The Last Airbender is a very good show and I don't say that lightly.  Action, romance, suspense, philosophy, comedy and drama all enjoyable by adults and suitable for kids.  It's worth the thirty dollars.  Trust me, you will love it and your kids or parents or friends or whoever else you know will love it.  Everyone can appreciate it.",1282348800,3,4579,4.514598540145985

3454193,5,B001AI7766,"I have to first say that I am not an avid cartoon watcher but do enjoy a good animation movie (Howl's Moving Castle is my favorite movie)from time-to-time.  I began watching the series and caught myself not being able to stop.  Eventually I bought all three seasons in one swoop.  I caught myself being shocked at the quality of the artwork, the excellent script and character development, fantastic action sequences that rivals any mainstream television show.  But I'm a devoted fan for one main thing - the principals that the characters follow about friendship, loyalty, honor, courage and peace.  Aang, the central character, capsulizes innocence weighted with much responsibility.  His character is able to balance love for the people he loves and his responsibility to humanity without sacrificing his ideals.  Very rare that I find a cartoon that isn't heavy-handed or trivializes hardship.  I think that is what makes this series appealing to all ages is that whether Aang was 12 or 50 years old, his character's journey was relatable.  I have a 2-year-old nephew so I'm excited to one day share the DVDs with him.",1278028800,4,1122,4.989247311827957
3454194,2,B001AI7766,"If you liked season one, you probably loved season 2, which deepened existing characters (most specifically Zuko), weaved plot lines that involved previous characters assumed lost (Jett and Suki) and even added Toph, a great addition to the fellowship. Season two ends with so many questions that beg to be answered...so many I don't even want to attempt listing them and I don't want to give spoilers, but all of that being said, I am a 26 year old man who really does not like cartoons or anime and I will rewatch the story of Aang many more times. Even if season 3 left me a little cold.

My first criticism of season 3 would be that the battles scenes do not add anything to the series. The flames, rocks and waves are bigger, much bigger, but there are no steps forward. The progression of earth bending in season 2 rocked my world (pun definitely intended) and they teased the idea of metal bending (which is prominent and very slick in The Legend of Korra), but season three is not revolutionary it is bloated and left me playing Diner Dash during much of the season.

Plot lines definitely become pied patterns by season 3. I am sick of episodes revolving around escaping a prison, which this season has at least 3 episodes involving such an escape. What really turned me off was that Sokka becomes a ""master"" of something after a few afternoons' work, same for Aang, and Katara.

Really though, it's the loss of fresh, new characters and the inability to further develop the existing ones that drags this season down a rocky road behind slow wagon. All of the side plots have been resolved, it seems like the writers were hesitant to give our heroes something to do and as a result, the writers struggle to find momentum getting to the only thing the audience wants to see: Aang go crazy on Ozai (maybe him hook up with Katara, but Ozai first). Even when some interesting things might happen, the gang pairs with the Earth King, the gang escapes with a troop of secondary, teenage characters after a battle, but nothing happens, all of these characters get dropped and the core four move along to another episodic time kill. Which, the other season do also, but as we see, they pay off in later episodes and bridge the series, where as season 3 treats the stories like stepping stones.

What should have happened: The third season should have been cut down to 10 episodes, maybe even just a movie, allowing audiences to get their due desserts in 1 tenth of the time.

UPDATE: To prepare for The Legend of Korra, I rewatched this entire series with my girlfriend (who had not seen it). It was a tough sell. In the end she only liked the show for Zuko and Iro (and she liked Toph) and I can't blame her. Zuko and Iro are my favorite part of the series also and season 3 does a fair job of paying their relationship off, despite the death of Iro's voice actor. On a repeated watch, I still hold true to my review above the fights are just bigger flames, etc., but the final show down with Aang and Ozai is entertaining. This is the season where I think my girlfriend hit a breaking point with Sokka, literally telling him to shut up at point. In short, I wish this series would come out on bluray so that I could watch the final battle on my projector and it not look blurry!",1277856000,9,3281,4.452579034941763
3454195,4,B001AI7766,"The final season of Avatar: The Last Airbender unfortunately flounders a bit after the excellent second season. The majority of this season is full of either filler episodes or unkept promises. For me, the latter is exemplified by the 4th episode ""Sokka's Master"". Finally Sokka is given a skill that he can use in battle, aside from coming up with all the plans throughout the series, but outside of the fight sequence at the end of this episode Sokka doesn't use his newly aquired sword fighting ever again in the series.

A second example of this is when Katara learns blood bending from an old water bender in the episode, The Puppetmaster. Granted you could argue that she's overpowered at that point, but it did give us an excellent fight sequence. But just like Sokka's Master, it's not really used again except to subdue a few fire nation soldiers in The Southern Raiders. I'm still confused as to why the team behind Avatar would create these episodes if the characters weren't going to transfer these skills at any point during the rest of the series.

However, at the midpoint of series picks up during and after the invasion to actual work towards Avatar strengths of purpose. The only real misstep after the halfway point is the way Aang's firebending lessons pretty much disappear after he encounters the masters. Overall, this is a good season finale that's plauged by a several episodes in the beginning that are purposeless. And continues with the series standards of wonderful voice overs and being beautifully animated.

#1 sidenote: Can someone please explain to me where the Northern Water Tribe was during the invasion. They said at the end of the first season that they would be linking up with the Southern Water Tribe. Granted the invasion had to lose, but why would the only nation that didn't get overtaken by the Fire Nation have no presentation on the most important battle during the ending of the war?

#2 sidenote: The filler episodes that I didn't talk about before are: The Headband, The Painted Lady, The Runaway, and The Southern Raiders. You can argue about The Ember Island Players, but I thought it was nice to have an episode of comic relief before the finale.",1277510400,3,2200,4.796833773087071

I can't say enough about the impact of this show. I won't go into much detail about it since so many others have offered-up their views about the plot line and character developments. I will say that if you miss out on this series you will be doing yourself a huge injustice and missing out on a wonderfully developed series, one of the few really worth watching. The show will make you laugh, it will invite you to reflect on yourself and others and it will leave you wanting more! If you have children (5 and up) I would strongly recommend that you introduce them to this series. There are great lessons of life, respect, honor, compassion and honesty throughout the entire series. While it leans towards eastern philosophies, they certainly go hand-in-hand with the core christian theology and you will not find a better series to entertain your children while having them exposed to valuable life lesson type of material. If you do not have children, or don't think that you want to watch an animated series, please don't neglect yourself of this experience. It is truly worth your time to watch.

I started watching Avatar:TLA when it first come out on nickelodeon I'd watch the first couple episodes orso and kind of fall away becuase I was always busy on that day. Be it wasn't until a year or two later when nickelodeon had a Avatar marathon from episode:1 to the series funnily""Sozin's comet"" it lasted almost a week. And let me till you I watch every last one of them and I was hook't from there on out. Being 17 at the time I never thought that I would become a fan of a animaed series but Avatar:TLA is not like any other animaed series out there you become to believe that the store is real and that character's are real.

I think that this was the way that they had planned for the final season of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

These characters have depth to them, unlike the vast majority of TV characters (animated or not).

This season is by far the best season as well.  You can't really watch and enjoy it without seeing the first two, but it has some of the best moments (Azula and gang at Ember Island is one of the funniest things I've seen, as well as the Ember Island Players).

My friends and I watched each book in a day or two, that's between 4 to 8 1/2 hours each day until we finished them off.  That's a marathon.

Despite its light-hearted nature, Avatar has deep and engrossing story lines with complex characters who mature over time.

3454217,5,B001AI7766,"I won't talk about the series specifics too much; all the other reviewers have covered it so well. I will only say that this series is the perfect mixture of drama and comedy relief, of character growth and interrelationships, with a winding plot arc. WOW. I've never seen any U.S. animated series have the power to move me like this one did. There's a subtlety and consistency behind the scenes, a masterful weave of culture, personalities, love, hate, revenge, forgiveness, fun, determination and heroism that is impossible to describe unless you watch it all. Care is given to each character, with individual episodes that develop each one and provide backgrounds.

The minimalistic style of animation can at first look almost kiddish, but don't mistake that. This series goes far beyond some ""kiddy"" cartoon series. It's every bit as epic and grand as the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series. as imaginative and original. It doesn't take itself as seriously, but it's the humorous moments that are truly genius.

My only huge problem is that despite a fantastic ending that satisfied most loose ends, I was left wanting more because this series is just so dang good that there's no possible way to stop and be okay with that. Nickelodeon has made a grievous error in allowing this series to end with just 3 seasons. There were some loose ends that could lead into another plot arc. They have an established audience and the series enjoyed extremely good ratings. Why not give the series another few seasons if the creators/writers can come up with the plot?

In the last twelve months I've purchased dozens of videos, including all the current episodes of season one of Glee, and had no problems playing videos using this method.  To my chagrin and after spending three hours on the phone with both XBOX and Amazon help desk professionals, it's been determined these episodes have a unique DRM encoding that allows them only to be played on the computer to which they were downloaded. Simply put, if you intend to stream these to any device not the computer they are saved, expect it not to work. Yes, I'm sure I could find an application that would allow me to strip out the copy protection, but some people, me being one, would like to watch the videos in the same easy manner I've watched all of my other Amazon Video On Demand purchases. All input regarding possible solutions to this dilemma (besides breaking the apparent copy protections) are welcome.

  I am a literary person, and I must say that these stories are gripping, well-written, and very humorous.  They even make fun of themselves, particularly in the episode ""The Ember Island Players, in which the characters view themselves caricatured in a play.  The series is very engaging in the ways the martial arts are used for ""bending,""  and I'm especially impressed with the depth of character development running through every episode.

The Avatar's message of violence only in self defense and defense of others, but never taking a life I found an appropriate one, but another message of listening to yourself and searching within for answers, respecting wise counsel, forgiveness, loyalty, friendship, and love.

The season makes a decent start with Aang being frustrated and mad as hell that he lost in Ba Sing Se, and then makes a nice story progression with the invasion on the day of Black Sun. Zuko finally stands up to his father and sticks it to him by joining up with the Aang gang. He wasn't immediately accepted, but after a while earned the respect of the rest of the group and became one of their biggest key contributors.

Once Sozin's comet finally came, I was awed at how amazing the fight scenes were, especially Zuko vs Azula. A crazier than usual Azula is pretty scary and it was pretty amazing that Zuko and Katara were able to work together to take her down.

As for Aang vs Sozin, I was hoping he'd die a slow painful death, but being forced to rot in prison after losing your bending abilities is just as good of a punishment.

All in all, the ending story may have some annoying loopholes and flaws, but it's still a very enjoyable box set to sit and watch. If you've enjoyed watching this show in the past, buying season 3 will be worth the money.",1241827200,,1329,4.282868525896414

3454243,5,B001AI7766,"Right from the first episode I was hooked on to this series. Animation is so plain and the characters are so believeable that I felt like I was traveling with the group myself.

Very colorful and smooth, the animation is one of the best I've seen. Lot's of color and action, with some slow-mo effects. Fight sequences and physics are demonstrated very well. You feel the weight of the rocks thrown at characters or feel the blast effect of ball of flames when exploding.

Voice acting is also great. Especially Zuko and Iroh, man, they are amazing, you can feel the conflict in Zuko, or the great wisdom of Iroh. Also dialogues are clever and the jokes are well placed, Toph kills me when she opens her mouth, yip, there is a smile on my face now.

Plot is, well, kind of complicated to explain. A series this long bound to have some boring episodes, so, yes, there are some boring episodes.  But as I've said before, I felt like I was travelling with my friends, so there were some fun times and some slow times, just like real life. Even so, every episode contributed something to the main plot.

In my opinion, this season is a fitting ending for this series. Wouldn't have it any other way.

A few words about my main character: Toph

By far, the most powerful bender in the series. Avatar only surpasses her slightly because he mastered all four disciplines, but never seen him bend metal. I don't know, it's a very close call. Also, she never wastes her words, everything she says has a purpose. Even her jokes are a constant reminder of how we, regular folks, are ignorant about disabled people.

The only thing bad I can think of about season 3 is knowing that there won't be a season 4. This series was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching and if you enjoyed season's 1 and 2 then I'm sure season 3 won't let you down.

I also really liked that they had a definite story with a clear end that they worked towards so that the series didn't descend into having a lot of unnecessary padding just to keep it running longer (like many other popular series, such as Lost and X-Files). In addition to the excellent story, the music is beautiful as well, particularly in this final season. The end of the series wrapped up the storyline very well, but also left open some very interesting possibilities, should they continue at some point. I sincerely hope they do.

Not only is it better than my previous favorites, namely Robotech, and the wonderful Miyazaki classics like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, etc., but it is just amazing to me the kind of culture and spiritual essence of truth that it is spreading to the masses, and to our children especially.

I have had to watch the whole series over and over again and each time I have gotten more out of it.  The animation and artistry is spectacular, the music dramatic and inspiring, and the depth of the story ranges from themes of suspense, comedy, trajedy, respect, heart-break, and love.  The main characters develop and grow up through their journey, and in this thrid series, we find them having to face all their fears and transformations, in order to save the world.

There was a whole lot of authenticity to Chinese and eastern cultures that really impressed me.  Also, the spirituality from Daoism, Zen, Buddhism, and Hinduism is apparent in the wisdom shared by Aang, Uncle Iroh, and the Lion-Turtle.  The concepts of qi (chi) blockage and energy medicine are portrayed here in ways I've never seen before--the writers really know their stuff, not only in the martial-arts way.

It blew my mind seeing what the Lion-Turtle did to Aang, lighting up his heart chakra and third-eye chakra, giving Aang a new ""power"" he had not had in any of his previous Avatar lives.  The reason I was so blown away was that I had been shown this spiritual technique, just like that one the Lion-Turtle did to Aang, when I was learning to channel back in 1994--but it was Spirit that showed me, not a person (or strange animal, for that matter!)  To see this thing happening on an animated TV show--I could hardly believe my eyes!  Then Aang used the same pose in his final defeat of the Fire Lord, and when he straightened his own head and spine (aligning the Qi in Qigong pose) the energy flowed the righteous way.  I just could almost not even believe they could show something like this for real, but with animation is comes out so clear...where did they get this information?  I wonder how they knew how much of this is real in Medical Qigong?  Kudos to all of them.",1231977600,114,2427,4.587962962962963

3454265,5,B001AI7766,"I am a 15 year old from Singapore, and like other teenagers, have lost interest in everyday television cartoons like the ever-popular Spongebob Squarepants. Naturally, I thought Avatar was no different, but boy was I dead wrong! I gave the show a chance, and to sum up my opinion of the show in three words: I love it.

The Asian influence, the storyline, the characters - just plain amazing. Avatar must be the best kids show ever made. And because I was THAT excited to get this on DVD, I couldn't wait for Books 2 and 3 to be released locally (only Book 1 has been released here) and so I just had to ask my mother to buy them off Amazon. Yes, Avatar is that amazing.

And for buyers outside region 1 like myself, as far as I am concerned, the discs on this set do not contain RCE (regional coding enhancement). As long as you have a multi-regional player, you should be fine. However, when played on both my DVD players, the image tends to get just a little pixellated. I'm not quite sure if it has to do with my PAL television system, but I have other NTSC DVDs that work fine. Otherwise, the image and video quality is perfect.

Highly recommended by this 15 year old :)",1230508800,2,1176,4.3122171945701355

3454268,5,B001AI7766,"I am a 38-year-old mother of two and I have never been a fan of Anime.  It was with reluctance that I watched a few episodes of Avatar with my older son.

I started watching Avatar I loved it.  I caught a couple episodes of Book 2 and I was hooked.  The story of Avatar rivals any storyline you will find in prime time television or even one of the best films you have ever seen.  This television series, marketed to pre-teens and teens, is something the whole family can enjoy.

The mythology, the characters, the animation...all of it is first rate.  I found the parallel paths of Aang's journey and Zuko's journey to be especially insightful.  Not only is this show entertaining, but the discussions that can be generated with your children are especially worth any penny this show is priced.  At Thanksgiving, Avatar started a lively discussion with extended family on what kind of bending each person would like to have and what bending was the most powerful.  Each person had a different reason for why they chose what they did.

I feel that if a show is marketed to children, it shouldn't always just be mindless entertainment (not that there is anything wrong with that).  This show can be watched by everyone and enjoyed by everyone.",1229040000,9,1242,4.621004566210046

3454271,5,B001AI7766,"This, in my opinion, is the best season of the show. There is more action, more humor, even better animation than before (if that's possible), and...well, the war between the Aang/Katara and Zuko/Katara fans was never more evident than during this season. Mike and Bryan (the creators) do love to tease us.

Another thing is that Zuko and Suki join the Gaang, adding another dimension to the show. Having Zuko, who began as an antagonist and ended up as an anti-hero by the start of Book 3, make such a bold statement against his father is one of the highlights of the whole show. It's realistically done, with Katara unwilling to trust him at first and friction within the group as a result. (Suki, meanwhile, slips in without a problem just before the finale, because everyone loves Suki.)

Some fans might say that to close out the finale (which is the best finale I've ever seen for any television show, period) with a romantic moment between Aang and Katara was too cliche and went against the tone of the show, but I don't think so. After all, the show began with him waking up in her arms - it's only right and proper that it end with them, the two most important characters, finally coming to terms with the fact that their relationship has changed into to something more.

In closing, I will say this: You might think that this is ""a kids' show"" just because it's broadcast on Nickelodeon and is animated. You couldn't do yourself a bigger favor than to cast off those assumptions and treat yourself to this incredible show, which is more intelligent and well-done than most of the adult shows nowadays.",1227398400,25,1612,4.629370629370629

Having this Book on DVD is so nice because not only is each episode commercial-free, but you don't have to wait a week to see the next episode. And trust me, that's a big deal with this show because it's very suspenseful. At first I had my doubts about how intriguing a cartoon could be, but this show definitely proved me wrong.

3454280,5,B001AI7766,"I'll stick to reviewing the last season. My entire family has sat enthralled throughout the whole Avatar series. Probably a little intense for many young children, although ironically my daughter has grown up from 4 to 6+ years old watching this entire series. The third season gives fans the payoff, and while there is always substantial comic relief, there's also a lot more character development and a detectable character arc, far more than you would ever expect from a Nickelodeon series. (Hats off to Nickelodeon and their corporate masters, by the way, for getting this show on the air and seeing it through.)

The graphics quality takes a big leap in the third season; colors look more saturated and a lot more 3-D modeling comes into play, with stunning results. Now, this isn't Bergman, but there are many emotional moments throughout the last few episodes of Season 3, but everything takes a back seat to the jaw-dropping enactment of the final battle between the Avatar and the Firelord.

The entire series is something that anim fans can't miss; it's going to stand as a classic of its kind for a long time. The vocal acting, particularly by the fellows playing the Avatar and Zuko, is uniformly excellent. I've studied martial arts for lengthy periods in the past, and the verisimilitude and hard work and research involved in bringing these fight scenes and artful motions to the screen is close to 100% accurate. One scene I particularly liked was the Dancing Dragon form in an episode  on Season 3 Disc 3, where both Zuko and Aang both fully master firebending.

I could go on and on. Don't miss it!",1224979200,,1616,4.802158273381295

Anyone reading this review (for Book 3) already knows how much delightful the animation and the martial-arts-inspired fiction of ""bending"" can be.

Leave it to Nickelodeon to leave its loyal viewers out to dry yet again.  There are so many beautiful backgrounds that would look great in their original widescreen format, but alas, ""it's just a kids' show,"" right Nick?

3454292,5,B001AI7766,"This show was an amazing ride the entire way. It was funny, and had an amazing plot with characters you grow to love. I have never seen a cartoon with such an emotional storyline. The beauty of this story is that you see the characters growing and finding themselves and the strengths within.

Though many people still feel there will be more Books and perhaps a sequel to tie up loose ends, I'm going to have to be the bearer of bad news and say, no that is not the case. The creators of this show appeared at Comic Con following the series finale and told everyone this is indeed the end. They will be making a new series, but the story of Aang and his gang are over.

Season three was not the best of the series. Season two in my opnion was the greatest of this show. Yet, season three did have many amazing moments. You get to see friendly faces once again and some questions, not all are answered. Though Aang is the main character of the series who struggles with his role as the world savior, it is the anti-hero character of Zuko you fall in love with and ultimately yearn to see succeed in his quests.

Season three is a little darker than the rest of the series. The creators were asked since it had a huge adult based following, did they change aspects to convienance that age group. They said no everything was the way they had planned from the beginning. In my opnion, I don't think that is entirely true. While this show has always had darker themes (A ruthless king orders mass genocide on entire nations of people) the first season seemed lighter and easy going. The longer is was on television and the more viewers it had the darker it seemed to be.

The only downside to this series ending, is there are major questions that were left hanging. One more blatantly thrown in the veiwers face and left for nothing. The question of Zuko's mother is asked. Then you get no response. At comic con it was stated they did indeed have a final ending for Zuko's mother but the co -creator had it cut in the editing stages. Why? I don't know. Seems rather ignorant to me.

Other questions are left hanging. What happend to Azula? How will the people of the Fire Nation react to Zuko being  Fire Lord? Why did they have a 15 year old girl ""fall in love"" with a 12 year old boy?

The upside to this is there is a live action move in the process of being made. M Night Shymalan will be directing Book 1. It will be a three part series. Perhaps some of these questions will be answered there.

There are times where I have to tell myself this is ultimately a children's show. It can be frustrating because the answers I want are not there, yet maybe to the average twelve year old these questions don't need to be answered.

BOTTOM LINE: This entire series is one of the rare shows that both children and adults can sit down and enjoy.",1223769600,5,2838,4.309568480300188

The final season of Avatar captures the essence of this incredible story so well. It shows how each character has grown throughout the series.. The portrayal of Aang and Zuku especially are absolutely brilliant. The visual effects ..breathtaking! it rivals anything Disney has ever made during its peak!.. the final battle seen! everything I ever expected it to be!!!!

My only regret is that it ended..!! this is a ABSOLUTE MUST see!! This series will go down in history as one of the best television animations ever made in our generation!",1223769600,,702,5.095652173913043

It truly has something for everyone: complex, well-developed characters, intense and complicated plots, breath-taking animation, fabulous voice actors, and incredibly beautiful music. Everything about this show is simply fantastic. If you don't usually like cartoons, don't overlook Avatar; it is sophisticated and will please everyone on some level.

3454297,5,B001AI7766,"The whole series had little clues to it that stated secrets were being kept. Season 1, the water bending scrolls hinted that the other binders made their own scrolls.
Season 2, the swamp and sand benders showed the variety of skill at their art and at hiding. Katara had no idea about the Swamp binders and they were kin (in a way) to her.
Season 3, the Sun people. these people were thought dead and here they are protecting the last original Fire-benders.

What i expect from the sequel, the remaining Air benders will be looked for and Zuko's mom will be located. there is no way that the fire nation could have killed all of the air benders in the short time that Sozan's comet was boasting their power. at most it was only two hours maybe three. most likely the surviving air nomads went to ground and hid in the earth kingdom or under the air temples. or even hide amongst the fire nation like the Puppet master did.

Zuko's mom would be something to act as a closure for Fire Lord Zuko and allow him to have something of a family outside of Iroh.

After 9 some months of waiting after the incredible second season finale, hopes were high, and although Avatar fell slightly short of expectations, it still pulled off an awesome final season and truly gave the fans something to walk away with.

Pluses:
-Decent plotline for the finale (albeit formulaic and predictable)
-Some incredible animation
-Great characters (Zuko, Azula, and Sokka even stood out in particular)
-Brilliant soundtrack
-Signature, well-choreographed action sequences
-Several absolute gems (Avatar and the Firelord, Day of Black Sun Part 2, Boiling Rock, Ember Island Players, and of course, the finale)
-Conclusion to the series

Minuses:
-A few dud episodes (The Beach, Nightmares and Daydreams)
-The stench of filler wafting through the first half of the season
-Cheating, i.e. lifebending. (I consider this forgivable however, as the Avatar had technically already defeated the firelord.)

Overall: I highly recommend this entire series to everyone, though it would be a bad idea to jump in and buy this set exclusively. Instead, buy them all!",1222560000,,1127,5.4655172413793105

The finale especially was outstanding and the closure most satisfying, though I didn't want it to end.  I wanted more of such an awesome product.  However, even though I didn't have enough (and probably never will), I am thankful for what I consider to be a privilege to have seen this show.  It had entertained me so thoroughly.

3454301,3,B001AI7766,"Avatar has been a decent ride, but the third season of Avatar suffers from a lot of problems which I feel must be addressed.  The writing comes full stop at the start of the season and then continues again, only this time at a slow crawl.  A lot of the episodes feel like filler, and the writers hastily trying to throw in events that they forgot to do in the previous 40 episodes of the series (they forgot to give two of their main villains backstories which is ""remedied"" by a few throwaway sentences of dialog at the end of an otherwise silly beach-party episode.  Furthermore, most episodes until the halfway mark of the season feel like the writers being forced to meet their episode quota, as most of them begin and end with them killing time until the Day of Black Sun.  Afterwards, it still feels like they're killing time until the day Sozin's Comet arrives with the way they lazily hang out at their makeshift headquarters with not much else to do aside from going on a few random adventuers.  The finale itself, while possessing some fairly good animation, reminds us that this is a simple kids show we're watching, and extremely simplifies and glosses over a lot of plot points that could otherwise have been developed more.  It's also quite disappointing we were robbed from a believable way for Aang to defeat the final villain without relying on typical Deus-ex-Machina powers which are common enough in a lot of other shows.  As with most Nickelodeon shows, a few people hook up during the finale, despite little-to-no real development in the romance department.  However, the finale does manage to conclude most of the main story, even if it's extremely rushed, simplified, and leaves a lot of loose ends left hanging.

Overall, it's a lukewarm final season, which I feel is greatly below the second season in terms of good writing and entertainment.",1221609600,15,1868,4.7407407407407405

This season 3 was just all over the place and I was just waiting for it to get to the awesome epic end battle.

What a brilliant piece of work, and truly amazing that it came from Nickelodeon!

[I can't say any more than this, otherwise it would have to contain ""spoilers"", and that's just no fun for anyone involved!]

Needless to say if you haven't seen any of this series, you NEED to start with season 1, episode 1 and work your way through each and every episode. It is WELL worth your time to do so!",1220313600,39,655,4.433333333333334
3454305,5,B001AI7766,"I'd like to say that this series has been one of the pinnacle shows of the decade. Just when I thought The Clone Wars would be the only spectacular animated tv series, I was proven wrong as soon as I saw Avatar. Each season kept upping the ante not to mention the stakes and kept us holding our breath up to the series finale which was huge visually and an exemplary battle that blew Crossroads and Siege out of the water. My only criticism of season 3 is the lack of Iroh. It would have been great to see how he escaped or to have seen him present Zuko as the Fire Lord.

Many people have described that creating a prequel Book 4 would benefit the series and satisfy the fans including me. They could include the episodes of Aang's birth and revelation of his being the Avatar. How he met Appa and how he was trained by the monks and Gyatso.

For those who want a sequel to the show, here is a story to satisfy you: After five years Zuko has successfully brought the Fire Nation back to the way it was before his Great Grandfather's regime while Aang has helped him clear the world of any remnants of the Fire Nation Army and revive the tradition of the air nomads. Aang has great news, he and Katara are getting married. Zuko also has good news, he has news about his mother's location. Meanwhile Azula helps her father get out of prison and has discovered a way to get his bending back using a fragment of Sozin's Comet. They first rejoin the officers of the Fire Army and gather their forces to reclaim the fire nation. The attack affects th entire world once again as Sokka, Katara, Iroh, Zuko, Toph, Katara and Aang defend the four nations from the onslaught of the Grand Phoenix Army!",1219881600,3,1691,4.331230283911672

The grand story of Avatar is nothing we havn't seen before; A hero thought lost for a century returns to find that the world has been unbalanced and an evil empire is on the brink of total world domination. He is not ready to restore the balance, however, for he is merely a young and inexperienced incarnation of this hero, The Avatar, that has been eternally standing watch over the world and should once again, if Aang can get it together. Although the story may sound familiar the execution is brilliant. The entire premise of different cultures being able to manipulate different elements is genius, and the blending of eastern martial arts is done beautifully as well as adding an an action packed flair to the series. The characters are also deep and well developed, and you really get to know them, even the ones that don't speak. I was truly heartbroken when this series ended, because it had given me many good years of entertainment. As far as american made animes go, this is probably one of if not the best, but it's also accessible to people of all types and ages. WATCH THIS SHOW!",1219363200,11,1195,4.562790697674418

If you are unfamiliar with the show, you would definitely be best served to watch the first two seasons in advance. This way you would benefit from the back story. The production values and character development are first rate. Great background music and dialogue as well. This season is like the previous two in that not every episode is perfect (or will appeal to everyone), but that said, a ""weak"" episode of Avatar is better than most shows on tv (This is similar to how people rate Miyazaki movies that aren't their faves.).  I found this book of the series to be both wonderful and sad.  I loved how they tied most of the loose ends up, but was sad to see the series end.  Lastly, if you get/rent/view this book for the first time and like the characters, etc., you need to dedicate time to watch the last four episodes together.  I guarantee that you won't be happy if you don't.  Heck, you'll probably just blow off whatever it was you were planning on doing anyway to continue watching. It really is that captivating.

I especially liked the very last scene between Aang and Katara, and the last series of battle scenes were incredible in their complexity, ""beauty"", and form.  I wish that this show could continue in some incarnation, but I suppose that this will not be.  I guess that I always was hoping against hope that more airbenders would be found, or that we'd find out what happened to Zuko's mother.  Too bad that they could not go off on another adventure, with Aang as a full avatar.  I'm glad that I will be able to buy this complete set for the third year, and look forward to all the extras.  I found the plots to be engaging, intelligent, wonderfully animated, and well acted with good voice talent.

3454312,5,B001AI7766,"As with any great book or movie series it is sad to see it end. But at the same time it leaves me with a sense of satisfaction because this final season lives up to the lofty expectations created by its two predecessors.

I'm not much of an anime fan, and even less of a Nickelodeon fan so when my brother put this show on I payed half attention, sure it would be just another adventure in sixth grade navet. But before the episode was half over i was hooked. I couldn't help it and to this day I still don't know exactly why. The show is simply good. The strong plot is supported by strong great animation and nearly every episode leaves you wanting more.

That all concerns the series in general, and as I said the third season does not disappoint. It picks up right where the second season left off and jumps right in. For this reason I cannot recommend season 1 & 2 strongly enough. Season three is well organized and moves quickly. Best of all was the final episode (or four episodes) which features the most spectacular battles of the entire series.

As with all seasons, this third and final one IS interspersed with minor plot points that range from unsophisticated to downright dumb. But like I said they are minor and will not detract from the overall experience. Sokka, as always, leaves me laughing with his antics. Only reading these reviews will not allow you to fully understand why we all give it five stars. Anyone of any age should give this a try. Whether you rent it buy it or borrow it does not matter because the majority of you will be coming back for more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1218240000,3,1600,4.416949152542373
3454313,5,B001AI7766,"I must say when this show first came out I never wanted to watch it because I figured it was just like all this pokemon and dragonball z nonsense out on tv. This show is very different, the first episode I watched was an episode in the first book I believe where it shows Momo's story and Zuko's story where he goes out on a date with a girl, and I just thought what is this show really all about? Luckily nickelodeon was showing Avatar from the beginning that week for the beginning of the second season. I never missed an episode after that.

After all the waiting for the third season to finish I really was expecting a fourth one, because we have the books of: Earth,Water, and Fire. The creators could have made another book about Aang's life, but maybe it was better the way they ended this. I hope I didn't spoil anything by saying that.

I hope Avatar isn't ruined by M. Night Shyamalan, since he is planning on making an Avatar movie with real actors. Either way I will be buying this when it comes out, and I recommend it to anyone with or without children. For the kids it teaches them patience, understanding, choosing between right and wrong, and it's also very funny.

Its got everything - action, romance, friendship, betrayal, cool animals, elemental ""magic"", and some pretty fantastic animation and characters.

But all the heavy stuff is interspersed liberally with some really well-written humor and off-the-hook fight scenes (flawlessly and breathtakingly animated, by the way) that really just make this series a joy to watch, from beginning to end.

Avatar: The last Airbender is a solidly written/acted series with incredibly animated landscapes and a beauitful musical score.  This third season upheld the same standard set by its two predecessors.  I must admit I was bit upset at ""The Beach,"" but quickly forgave the show when it returned to its flawless formula.

Why buy Avatar?  First, it is just as engrossing for adults (I'm 26) as it is entertaining for children (I often watch with my nieces: ages 1 & 3).  Second, this show has an amazing amount of heart and depth to it.  I found myself trying to write down some of the lines that were said.

Third, the series is very clean.  Obviously, it is a cartoon, but I love this show more than LOST, House, or any other TV show that I normally watch partially due to its purity.  The perfect blend of story, character development, adventure, humor, and yes...even romance, all told through the eyes of a pure-hearted Airbender.

From the begining Avatar has been mind bending in how it was all going to be played out, but it ended very good unlike some cartoons or anime. This series is the far best I have seen in long years from the US. I've injoy this series it has it all for kids and adults. It's plot is different and is not but I've said before it is how you play out the story in the series and to it's final end. This series has great music in background you can really feel the tension and the drama in the series. They really out did them selves and I'm proud they did.  I will be a Avatar fan for life, now I'm just waiting for this box set to come out to finish my collection. Which I think everyone will being doing the same to. this show has such creative plot, action, love, and inspiration that feels your heart with laughs and emotion that you wish there was more.

You will not regret this entire series. Just check it out most anime fans have given up on cartoons in the US cause they could not believe that the US companies could make something so intertaining as this. Yes even I was one of those anime fans that gave up, but watching this series has given me new hope for this US and hope others will come in the future.

I felt like they just had to fill in the early part of the season with some episodes about stuff that didn't really matter in the larger scheme of things. That aside, this is still a very good season. Seeing the transformation of the characters and fruition of everything that we've been waiting for since season 1 was everything I wanted it to be. The final fight with the fire lord was intense and emotionally compelling. The closure was good, and it left some things unknown so as to keep the viewers thinking about what happened. If I was the director I would've done some things differently, but all in all I can't complain, most things are very well done.",1526169600,,892,4.478527607361963

It's extremely rare see a show appreciate all of its characters even the minor and explore what it means to be human through a fanatical lense.",1523750400,,299,4.660377358490566

I loved watching it on TV, but when I moved and decided to forgo a TV I had to rely on my laptop, which did the job, but I found it frustrating trying to find a site that had all the episodes of the same quality with NO COMMERCIALS! This set is amazing; the box set itself is cool, does not come with anything other than the DVDs and maybe a episode guide but I love it all the same. My sister was wide-eyed when I opened the packaged and showed her what I had purchased.",1521244800,,493,3.94
