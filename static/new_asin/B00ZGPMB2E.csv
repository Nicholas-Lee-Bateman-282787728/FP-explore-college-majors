7282248,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"Loved this movie! Super funny and heartwarming. I love Jemaine in almost all that he does, and this movie doesn't disappoint.

The fact is, this movie is about real people having real experiences. Maybe not the typical happy ending but the humor comes in it's honesty.",1440115200,4,268,4.826086956521739

7282250,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"I enjoyed this film a lot. I really enjoyed Jermaine Clement's acting and sense of humor. As a divorced parent, I could relate to some of the situations the character found himself in and the film helped me look at my own situation and learn to laugh at it. This film not only put me in a good mood, it also made me think about modern society and dating with children. This is overall an excellent film and it moves very well. I would recommend it.",1440028800,4,448,4.22093023255814

7282254,3,B00ZGPMB2E,Jemaine Clement was quite charming in this role especially with his girls!  The only part of the movie I felt fell short was the relationship aspect for Will and Diane. Diane was stern then she would be soft then she would be critizing then she would be swept off her feet  I felt she was not put together right. Diane was kind of all over the place. The character of Kat was great! They cast that role just right and the girls were adorable. Charlie was VERY hard to watch what a weasle.,1486598400,,488,4.236559139784946

7282259,2,B00ZGPMB2E,I tried so hard to like this movie. I watched it 3 times. I just couldn't get myself to do it (like it). I did not see top notch acting. The charecters showed no real growth. The ending just made it all worse. I can't say what ending I'd have wanted (as I don't like spoiling events in the movie) but it wasn't this way.

7282266,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"This is an interesting character driven film, you don't see many social disability (I know it's not a disability but can't think of a better word) characters in movies and this one Will Henry is played well by Jemaine Clement. If you've ever read The Rosie Project, Will is a similar character to that book's one. If you haven't, think of a milder version of Sheldon without the superiority complex or nerdiness. Some would probably mislabel Will as having Aspergers or Autism, but his character shares a few traits with those. Life was going okay for Will, he had done everything society had expected him to, he has a teaching job in a graphic novel writing/drawing class at an art college, he was in a committed relationship, he even had kids, but on a their fifth birthday party his life becomes a lot less outlined, when he catches his wife in bed with another man. She blames him of course and we pick up a year later (I think) where Will is just going through the motions, lives in a small apartment a long commute away from where his kids live, and his wife schedules the time he sees his daughters. He wants to spend more time with them. But his wife is making that even more complicated when her nanny quits and she dumps the twins on him without notice, she announces she's marrying the guy she cheated with, even though she told him she doesn't believe in marriage and basically blames everything wrong in the kids and her life on him.

This is a slow paced movie, but it works well with Will's character. We aren't told he is different by the twins grandparents or anyone like that ever appearing in the movie, instead we learn his outlook on the world by his graphic novel drawings, including drawings of him when with his wife, in bed and even with his kids where the character is always thinking, I just want to be alone. As well as the way other adults talk to him like he is a child or they have authority over him, not like a normal fellow adult.

The actress that plays the wife also does a great job, you're not supposed to like her, and you don't.  People, Places, Things is a great movie, it's not a comedy but does have occasional humorous or awkward situations since Will's mind obviously works differently to your standard adult mind.  Will is such a fun character, it would be great if he ever appeared again in a sequel, perhaps when the kids are older and he has to deal with issues a parent with teenagers or something would have to.",1460332800,,2462,4.4402654867256635
7282267,5,B00ZGPMB2E,this is a good movie. sweet funny and sad.,1459987200,,42,3.7777777777777777
7282268,4,B00ZGPMB2E,"This certainly isn't a new idea as far as stories go so the trip becomes equally as important as the destination. This is a pretty good trip.

Here's the scoop. Jemaine Clement plays a a published graphic novelist who catches his wife in having sex, in their house, the 5th birthday of their twin daughters. She wants a new life with her new love, so he needs to leave, find a new place to live and try to find a new life while keeping good relations with his two daughters.

This is a softer approach. There are the ups and downs of his juggling his job as a teacher of graphic arts and being a father who can make sure the girls are fed and get them to school on time. But this doesn't go in for the big kill. It tries more for something that talks to regular folk. That is not to say this isn't without its clever scripting and dialogue. It just works to avoid what might be considered typical Hollywood trappings. Clement does a sweet job with his role. He's not a dashing, exciting guy but he's good at his craft and the viewer sees this when he's teaching his class. He knows of what he speaks. His wife just wants more, but what's with her? The things she wants to do she never asked for before and he would never have kept her from pursuing them. And her new guy might not be her best choice. The twins are the right amount of cute and kiddish. They test dad and keep him from deluding himself.

There are some great conversations happening and it feels good to see Clement's swing at a new relationship along with his attempt to see what is really the best for him.

This is not a flashy film. The budget matches the content and it's all very fitting. If you're at all disposed to this sort of thing, you could do a lot worse.",1459555200,,1735,4.201201201201201
7282269,4,B00ZGPMB2E,"I never watched Jemaine Clement and his short-lived TV series Flight of the Conchords but saw him recently in the hilarious What We Do in the Shadows.  Hes an interesting character and in this little film, he also proves to be a very good actor.

Set in various NYC neighborhoods (shot mostly in Brooklyn), Will Henry (Clement) is a graphic artist who also teaches a class at Columbia.  At a birthday party for his 5-year old twin daughters (Aundrea and Gia Gadsby), he walks in on his wife Charlie (Stephanie Allynne, In a World) having just completed a sexy time session with their good friend Gary (Michael Chernus).  With divorce imminent, Will moves into the city and the strain of keeping up with his part time parental responsibilities proves trying.  The daughters are cute and very funny and thankfully very forgiving of Dads forgetfulness and clumsiness.

One of Wills more promising students, Kat (Jessica Williams of TVs The Daily Show) arranges for Will to come to dinner, essentially a blind date for her mother, Diane (Regina Hall, About Last Night).  The awkward meeting turns surprisingly touching and honest thanks to the chemistry between Hall and Clement, guided with a gentle hand by director Jim Strouse (Grace is Gone).  Charlies seeming uncertainty with her new relationship with Gary, creates doubts of his own just as things begin to spark with Diane.  The film has modest expectations but fulfills the simple narrative nicely.  Supported with strong performances, it is a film to check out.  Recommended.",1459382400,2,1531,5.011857707509882

7282276,4,B00ZGPMB2E,"Seeing that this movie had Jermaine Clemet in it, I thought it was going to be a lighthearted somewhat dry comedy.  I was wrong.  Clemet still delivers his dry humor all throughout, but this is the story of Will and Charlie.  Charlie lets Will know she is leaving him during their twin daughters 5th birthday party.  Will tries to be a better dad and juggle his crushing sorrow.  He is a graphic artist who also teaches at the local college.  The parts of the movie in the classroom I gained a better understanding of graphic novels and just how powerful they can be.

This is at times a lighthearted comedy with some very serious undertones.  Movies contains a moment of brief nudity when Will wants charlie's new boyfriend to put on a shirt and charlie takes her off.  There is also a little launguage in the movie but nothing over to the top.",1454198400,,845,4.470588235294118

7282281,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"This is a wonderful little independent film---funny, thoughtful, touching, with some really valid perspectives on divorce, parenting, dating, and art. Jemaine Clement is perfect as the father of twin daughters (who act like sweet little children, not like obnoxious mini-adults). His Flight of the Conchords dry humor is on display but in a way that is so believable for his character. The supporting cast did a wonderful job as well, although I think the character of the wife was pretty dislikable. Don't expect a straightforward beginning-middle-end where the story is wrapped up with a bow, but you won't feel cheated at the end.",1453161600,,633,5.155339805825243

7282284,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"This is a sweet, little gem of a movie. I love this kind of story, about some people doing the best they can to maneuver through life's twists and turns. There are no bad guys, everybody's just being who they are and the little girls steal the show. Some very lcomic moments fine with the lightest touch and not sappy at all, but it leaves you with a real good feeling. A nice flick!",1450742400,,383,4.1891891891891895
7282285,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"I really enjoyed this movie. So many movies are heavy, dark, and depressing, or outlandish, vulgar and loud and it leaves me craving something light and more down to earth.  I thought this movie was cute and sweet, and pretty light hearted.  I didn't think all the characters were one hundred percent believable (especially Charlie), but no one was ridiculous enough to turn me off of the movie.  The movie has a pretty simple story which I like and I thought it was well paced, although I think some people might think it was a little slow. I loved all the dry humor.

7282288,3,B00ZGPMB2E,"I write this because I love Jermaine Clement, and he is great in this movie, but the actor who portrays the wife is horrible.  She is very wooden, and almost like she is trying instead of acting.  The other actors are good, and the girl from the daily show is awesome as usual.  Would have given more star, but the wife really ruined the vibe.  You could see that they tried to edit her scenes, to make her less awkward.",1449014400,,420,4.2125

The girls in this movie are absolutely adorable. The film gets a little confused, it seems, with the mother character. The whole movie we as an audience are being told to hate her and her decisions, and then there is a weird moment (well acted, mind you) where it's like we are to have sympathy for her. It was a bit odd. I think it was trying to portray reality: no one is all the bad guy or all the good guy. There are two sides to every story and people have faults. Overall, it did portray that, and that's what matters. While I was a bit confused with things like that, in general I absolutely adored this movie.

There were some really funny and sometimes poignant lines as well as an abundance of sympathy for divorced and heartbroken weekend fathers.  I absolutely love watching Jemaine Clement on screen.  He and Regina Hall had great chemistry which made their scenes together really fun to watch. I wish they had given Stephanie Allynne a little more of a character to work with, she did a fine job acting but the writing for her character was a little thin and one dimensional.

7282328,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"As someone who isn't especially fond of Jemaine Clement's previous efforts, it's a welcome breath of fresh air to see him breaking away as a rom-com lead in James C. Strouse's winning little indie, People Places Things. The funny thing about Clement here is that he isn't necessarily changing anything about himself; his jokes are still droll and somewhat dry, but it's the pitch-perfect screenplay and welcome supporting cast that have helped him shine. While the film treads on familiar ground, People Places Things doesn't look or feel like most other rom-coms out there; it stands apart as an earnest and funny examination of loneliness, paternal love, and learning to accept the things we can't change.

Part of what separates the film from the rest is lead character, Will Henry (Clement), a graphic artist teaching at the School of Visual Arts. During the 5th birthday for his twin girls, Cleo and Collette (Gia and Aundrea Gadsby), Will walks in on is longtime girlfriend and mother to his children, Charlie (Stephanie Allynne) cheating on him with another man. She says she's been miserable for a long time; Will thought they were happy although he readily admits Happiness is not really a sustainable condition, a personal motto that has painfully turned out to be true. There are children involved; this break-up should be painful and ugly. The smartest and most refreshing move Strouse makes is to fast-forward past all that so we can see how Will has come out on the other side.

In short: he's not doing well. Lonely, living in a cramped apartment in the shabbiest part of Queens, Will is barely getting by. But he lives for the weekends that he gets to see his two girls, and as he brightens up when they're around so too does the film. It's not often enough we see positive stories about fathers who really just want to be part of their kids' lives. Not that Will is a perfect dad; he's pretty sloppy and a little bit of a mess when it comes to getting them where they need to go, but he means well and the love he has for them, and that they have for him, is obvious. He wants to spend more time with them, and just as he's getting what he wished for, love shows up and complicates things.

Another brilliant move is in the handling of Will's sorta-relationship with Diane (Regina Hall), an African-American literature professor with a no-nonsense attitude and some relationship baggage. She's the mother of Will's student, Kat (Jessica Williams of The Daily Show), and they bond through conflict over the value of real literature over Will's beloved comic books. The first date doesn't go as planned, but the sparks are obvious. However, Charlie's continued presence only complicates matters; not to mention Will isn't so good at the whole time management thing.

That Strouse never once brings up the subject of race deserves to be lauded. The casting of Hall proves to be an excellent choice, too, as she and Clement find remarkable chemistry in playing very different sorts of characters than they are accustomed to. Truthfully, Clement is great with everyone; his chill demeanor working well with the energetic young Gadsby twins, and it meshes well with the upfront performances of Hall and Williams. There's so much to enjoy here that the slight nature of the story is noticeable, but Strouse, who happens to be a cartoonist, fills that space with some nice artistic flourishes seen in comic book form. People Places Things is one of those movies that could get overlooked. It doesn't have any big stars, and the portrayals are perfectly-composed rather than flashy. But those who give it the shot it deserves will be won over by its many charms.",1441584000,9,3670,4.811410459587956

I laughed, and I cried for the love a dad can have for his twins, his ex and his new love.  So sit back, steal those yellow flowers, and tell the person you love, that you love them.",1441497600,,311,4.065573770491803

7282331,5,B00ZGPMB2E,"A wonderful and unexpected pleasure!  Can't believe I'm only just learning about the actor Jemaine Clement.  I'll be seeking out his other work for sure. The entire cast was great - so natural,- and the story line felt authentic in its ups and downs, and awkward muddling through the stuff of life.
Well worth the price of admission!

The cast is excellent - Jemaine is brilliant, Stephanie Allynne is great (see her also in Tig Notaro's documentary!), Jessica Williams was new to me and very good, and the Gadsby twins are pretty irresistible.

Being a fan of Flight of the Conchords, I obviously was very excited to see Jemaine Clement flex his acting chops on something other than a comedy. I was not disappointed! There was still that classic awkwardness that came through, which just seems to be a part of him, I guess. But he did such a fabulous job of portraying an incredibly sad man that the awkwardness just seemed like it was what made Will Henry Will Henry. I loved the communication between Will and Diane. In fact, every character in the story seemed to have a good idea of who they were except for Charlie. I felt like she was the most chaotic character and everyone sort of revolved around her wants and desires. The use of Will's drawings to explain complex emotions was brilliant. Great movie, sad but quirky. I really recommend it. It was a very real look at how an artist processes their emotions.",1440374400,9,903,4.512195121951219
