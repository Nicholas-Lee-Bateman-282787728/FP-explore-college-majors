5188968,5,B008XAT0ZU,"There was great care taken in the writing of this documentary, and in the shooting of the original recreations for the film series, as well as the appropriate and authentic use of very dramatic re-enactment footage. This is the first series of its kind produced for the 150th anniversary in 1080p HD.  Care was also taken to give a balanced portrayal of events -- highlighting the more far-reaching and important events that represented the war and the american people on the whole -- but condensing more than 4 years of incredibly dense and active history into a few hours would be a difficult task for anyone taking on that challenge. I do not believe that there are any errors of fact in these 7 films, but if there were omissions, it was not intentional, simply a matter of condensing so much history into a prescribed approximately 45 minute running time for each episode. I believe strongly that this series, at such a fantastic price, is ideal for educators and students of all levels and appropriate for all ages.",1342483200,110,1021,4.735955056179775
5188969,4,B008XAT0ZU,Great documentary. A lot of facts and very much in depth. Not a fan of the re-enactments though.,1504742400,,96,4.388888888888889

5188971,2,B008XAT0ZU,"I had several issues with this series.  First, I hate programs that waste my time with irrelevancies and repetition.  Yet each 48-54 minute episode of this series begins with 2 to 2-1/2 minutes of movie previews and opening credits followed by, on average, 5 minutes of summary recapping of events from the previous episode.  Extend that across the series, and that's nearly an hour of your life you will never get back.  Why can't they just cut all the extraneous crap and get right down to the particulars of the current episode?

Second, while the series is interesting enough in its own way, it doesn't really share any new information or shed new light on an old subject.  Apart from having better reenactors perhaps, there's really nothing distinctive that sets this Civil War documentary series apart from the scores of others that have been produced.

Finally, I just found the narrators voice tedious and tiresome.  He tends to recite the narration in a flat monotone, with little fluctuation or feeling.  Like he's bored with the whole subject.  So, of course, he bores the audience as well.

On the whole, I'd rate it ""Meh.""",1501027200,,1135,4.829015544041451

5188975,1,B008XAT0ZU,Could not make it passed the first episode because it gave as the main reason for the war as slavery. This was the fourth or fifth reason for the war. The main cause for the was the high tariffs put on goods coming into this country by the North. Of course Europe put in high tariffs on goods coming from this country. The South was hit hard by this since they sent most of their goods to Europe. The North's was not a big exporter so it did not hurt them.

5188980,1,B008XAT0ZU,"Tried to watch it, but it simply begins with too much propaganda. The Militia Act did not provide Presidential powers to raise an army to invade any of the U.S. states, which is what Lincoln actually did. The act gave the President power to raise a militia to quell an invasion by a 'foreign' army, or an insurrection by the Indian nations. By the time Lincoln has sent 75,000 troops into the South, those Southern states had already seceeded from the union per the U.S. Constitution.

James Madison, the father of the U.S. Constitution said this after someone in 1787 at the Constitutional Convention had proposed that the government be allowed to suppress a seceding state: ""A Union of the States containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction. The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound.""

The fact that Northern senators (like Senator James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin, and Rep. Daniel E. Sickles of New York) had proposed a Constitutional amendment to prevent secession after... seven Southern states had already seceded proves the U.S. Constitution did allow a State to secede from the union. So the argument that the U.S. Constitution did not allow a State to secede from the union is meaningless.",1494892800,2,1416,4.871369294605809

5188985,3,B008XAT0ZU,"Watching this is rather like trying to read an encyclopaedia. It covers too much ground in too little detail. Troop movements are shown (roughly one per battle) but only show one moment in time, rather than the sequence. Most of the action took place in the East (or that's the impression given by the film), though Vicksburg is at least mentioned. The narrator has a rather muffled and soporific voice. The re-enactments are very good, but after a time, all look the same, over the same fields. For my money, It's better to buy DVDs of specific battles to watch, and a book (or books with maps)
to tie the whole sequence together.",1491696000,18,631,4.592920353982301
5188986,1,B008XAT0ZU,"I quit watching at 5:05 into the first episode when the narrator observed ""the new constitution denigrated slaves with its three-fifths clause, by counting each as less than a whole person"".  Why would I want to watch, how could I trust anything that followed, such a deliberate and malicious misrepresentation?

For the record, the ""three-fifths clause"" (Art. I Sec. II Para 3) is not about the relative value of humans - it is about setting the number of seats available to a state in the House of Representatives, specifically to curtail the number of seats available to slave states. For example - at a 1:1 ratio, given a one representative per 30,000 population, the 4 million or so slaves in the southern states in the mid 1800s would have added roughly 133 representatives. At 3/5:1, that number is reduced to roughly 80.

You can verify this yourself by simply reading both the article and section previously noted and by reading about the Three Fifths Compromise. In the meantime, do yourself a favor and refrain from drinking this particularly nasty brand of push-cart propagandist Kool-Aid.",1491609600,15,1101,4.9728260869565215

5189004,1,B008XAT0ZU,"5 minutes into this program"" and I had to turn it off. Right off the bat they twisted facts by declaring that the three fifths clause for slaves was a denigration of them being sub human. The fact was that the free north wanted to make sure the south didn't get to much power in the house of representatives by using the enumeration of slaves as part of their population thereby giving them more representatives. Remember the number each state gets is based on their total population. Doing so would have outnumbered the free black states northern representatives.

If a program can not even start off factually then the rest of it is suspect and not worth my time watching.... I hope this helps save some other poor person from wasting anytime on this historical garbage.

5189005,4,B008XAT0ZU,"Narrated with a Southern sympathy.  Grant stopped prisoner exchanges simply because the Southerners were recycled back to their fighting units.  The south did not have the manpower and stopping prisoner exchanges cut into the Souths ability to field troops.  A crucial historical fact concerning Lee vs Grant should be made.  Lee averaged a loss of 20% of his troops on every campaign.  As Lee typically fought with smaller armies than the North, this percentage would cut deeper in his force.  In fact when Lee was the aggressor like Antietam and Gettysburg, his losses averaged 30% of his command.  Grant on the other hand averaged a loss of 10% of his troops on every campaign.  However this documentary focuses on the largest losses of the North and not the rest of the campaigns.  Lee fought battle strategy.  Grant fought a war strategy.  Richmond was not Grant's objective.  The objective was always Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia.  I recommend the 'Great Commanders' series.  There is an episode on Grant and Lee.",1483142400,2,1028,4.935672514619883

Film lighting at times looked like it was dimming and brightening, at one point the commentator wanted to quote a letter written by a woman but instead of a recital of the letter, there was just a long silence with a faint background sound of a battle in progress, then the commentator continues with the story. If you watch the first couple episodes then you've pretty much seen 85% of all of the fighting scenes for the whole film. When the commentator is talking about a specific battle, they just replay the same fight scenes from previous battles over and over like there was something you missed the first time. Maps? Nope, on occasion you'll get a situational map at the beginning of a battle discussion but that's it. Do you recall seeing a map of Cold Harbor? I didn't think so.

The information is good; I've found a few things I disagree with factually but nothing glaring such as Grant participating at Perrysville in 1862 that's in one of my dvd sets. The reenactments are satisfactory although the scenery is the typical generic background of most reenactments; I would have liked to have seen a little more use of maps and photos though.

I tell you one thing I absolutely love about this set is the intro segment. I have no idea if the music is original or taking from somewhere else, but I absolutely love it.

5189066,3,B008XAT0ZU,Well blu-ray * c.... figure it out.  kinda blasted this for being the anti ken burns documentary.  now having been around some historians.  They don't think of the Civil War Ken Burns movies as a documentary but as entertainment.  So depending on what your view is of Ken Burns work...  This could be a deal breaker ie if you like his work stay away from this disc.  If you don't like his work this might be useful.  Video quality though ...  only format is good.  ie I've always preferred blu-ray over any other format for one reason.  The scratch resistant layer.  (that and it's one layer of plastic)  It's more durable than dvd which is brittle.  So is HD DVD  Gonna confuse you soon when UHD's come out.  yes indeed  HD DVD as a name sucked.  But they think the'll make another go of it.  why not Ultra Blu Ray HD  not Ultra High Definition ??  gonna confuse some people and already are with the red cases that are really blu.  frankly many of the red cases I'll probably either throw away or chisle out the blu ray logo and stick HD DVD in there.  Oddly I was a very early Blu Ray fan everyone else in MCSE loved HD DVD.  have no idea why.  super easy to scratch and cracks.  X_X  DVD's all over again.,1433721600,,1208,4.234513274336283

5189109,2,B008XAT0ZU,"After reading several reviews i decided to give this a chance, at 7.50 i figure it would at least give me a good 5 hour documentary on a war i have long studied, and been invested into since reading freeman's lee (highly recommended biography); what i found was an average documentary that you would find in history channel, condensed in content and heavily biased against the south.

Dont get me wrong, there is nothing factually wrong with what is presented, its the way its presented where it fails, in chapter one we hear from lincoln about 20 times while lee is only named at minute 36 and not to be heard again until the later part of chapter 2. We also hear a lot from Grant, McClellan and others while the president of the confederacy Jefferson Davis is only an afterthought.

The reasons for the war are only blamed on slavery and Lincolns election, again, while not false its incomplete and that makes it biased.

I have a million examples (like not saying a thing about lee's involvement on the Harper's ferry incident) but it would make this review to long.

No wonder its impossible to proudly wave a confederate flag without being label a racist if teachers are using this material to teach future generations, i only hope they point and educate them on all the issues this documentary does not touch correctly.

Now, the reason i gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because as an introductory documentary, and to highlight important events of the conflict, it does a good job; and if it gets one more person interested in this most important of american wars, and while doing more reading he gets to see the real war, then im happy.",1403740800,8,1640,4.5646258503401365

5189144,5,B008XAT0ZU,"As someone who spent his first 9 years in Massachusetts and the next 9 in Virginia digging up minie-balls and in Maryland in the '60s, I have always been fascinated by The Civil War.  When other kids were reading about dinosaurs or sports figures, I was reading about Antietam, Gettysburg, and Vicksburg; about Lee and Jackson, Grant and Sherman.

I have watched the Ken Burns The Civil War many times and it is superb.  But the Burns series is mostly still pictures and the individual consequences, personal letters, and driving social forces.  I lamented a lack of battlefield details and live action.

The Ultimate Civil War provides that. While beginning with the underlying causes of the war (Episode 1, Sins Of The Fathers) which I consider the best summary of the causes of the war I have seen, the subsequent episodes move promptly into the battles.

The battle maps, while briefly shown (well there IS the pause button of course) are detailed, clear and excellent. The maps of the battle of Gettysburg particularly showed the complex and sometimes chaotic nature of the attacks and counterattacks.  I particularly liked the way that arrows of attacks were straight when successful but curved back when failed.  I compliment the map-drawer.

There are still photos and live re-enactments, and they are woven together well.

You should not confuse the Ken Burns series with this one; they are different in focus, style and presentation much as West Side Story is different from Romeo and Juliet, but are both are telling the same same story.  You should have both.  Still, if I only one, I would prefer The Ultimate Civil War.",1370908800,97,1633,4.898181818181818
5189145,1,B008XAT0ZU,"This production is utterly lacking in objective viewpoint and wholly devoid of depth. It is a very superficial treatment of a complex topic, and the viewer should be warned that he is about to be propagandized rather than educated (and rather obviously propagandized at that). The only thing that saves it from complete disaster is its use of re-enactors (re-enactors, as a rule, take a fierce pride in their roles) but the film's directorial ineptitude serves to undermine even their sincere efforts. The production otherwise seems unable to wallow out of a grammar school level swamp, and I gave it a rating of one star only because there wasn't one lower.",1370217600,7,658,4.936936936936937

This is not bad, but the voice acting is atrocious. The narrator, who isn't bad, says Gen. Johnston correctly, but then the next guy (forgot who he was acting as, Grant?) pronounces it Johnson, over and over! Almost all of the footage going on in the background is not related to the narrative. The maps they show are great, except the fact they show them far too quickly and not often enough. When telling the story of troop movements or a battle it helps to visualize it with maps, but they flash the map for 2 seconds and then it is back to stock battle footage unrelated to the narration! I did notice the maps are straight from Wikipedia, which is good and funny at the same time. You are better off saving the money and just reading the wiki pages.

These people did do there job putting this vidio together. The minus which makes me round this down too a 4 from a 4.5(choice not offerd).Vidio quility is a little weak in some spots,like the films been shown to many times,or not cleaned properly(Maybe Blu-version is better):The music at times over powers the narrator in spots.

Then skips too a southern woman,who seems to of felt his assination was a terrible loss for the South as well as the North. Apparently Pres. Davis had simular feelings.

5189182,1,B008XAT0ZU,"This program is a production of Mill Creek Entertainment/Lion Heart Filmworks.  It basically amounts to a ""clip show"" created by taking video of battle reenactments from their previous productions, interspersed with many of the long-familiar black-and-white Civil War photos, and adding a voice-over narrator to create a one-volume narrative of Civil War history.  The occasion was to market this for the war's sesquicentennial.

The idea may have been great in theory, but it really adds up to a disappointment.  I don't mind the re-hash of reenactment video but it would have been nice to see some drama (i.e. speaking scenes by the reenactors).

I didn't really need a new narrative documentary on the history of the Civil War but the main reasons I bought this program are because 1) it was $9.99 at FYE; and 2) because I was hoping it would contain clips of the film ""No Retreat From Destiny.""  It does.  I've long wanted to see that film but for some reason it is unavailable except at the price of $500 here on Amazon.  I'm very interested in the movie because it features the battle of Fort Stevens, July 11-12, 1864 in Washington, DC.  This battle is special to me because I grew up on the battlefield site, which is now a developed, commercialized neighborhood.

The well-chosen letters read by voices familiar to many, the gripping musical selections (mostly period pieces though Ashokan is modern), and especially the wonderfully engaging and honest comments of Shelby Foote, make this a production which should be viewed by all Americans, and indeed by non-Americans as well.

Having lived much of my life in the South (though a New Yorker at birth), I am keenly aware of the differences in viewpoint as to the political aspects of the terrible War Between the States.  These will continue to be debated ad infinitum.  But I think the film has been quite fair in pointing out the deficiencies as well as the strengths of the major characters.

5189223,4,B008XAT0ZU,"I'd give this documentary five stars except for the poor quality of the soundtrack (the music is obnoxious and drowns out the commentators and the narrator - there are no subtitles).

This documentary is very, very well-written.  It covers many of the moral, political and military issues of the time.  The re-creation of the battle scenes is some of the best that I've viewed.  The re-creations give you a real sense of the hardships and tragedies endured by the troops.

The documentary seems to be fair and balanced, exploring the views and beliefs of both sides in the conflict (North and South).  The well-written narration illuminates many of the historical forces that shaped the world-shaking conflict.  For example, much of the brutality visited by the North on the South, at the end of the War, arose simply because everyone was despondent over the War and wanted it to end.  As the CSA still had over 150,000 troops in the field at the time of Appomattox (Lee's surrender), the War could have continued indefinitely.

The documentary accurately points out the terrible attrition on both sides of the conflict (over 500,000 died on both sides) and the drastic efforts of leaders, on both sides, to try to end the conflict by decisive battles.

There is a balanced, and erudite exploration of the moral and legal issues of slavery in the South.  There is also a very-well written episode on the efforts to reconstruct the South after the War, and, the political battles fought over the issue of whether to punish the South for the insurrection.

In all, this is one of the best documentaries I've viewed on the Civil War.
