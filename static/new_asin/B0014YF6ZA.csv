8256606,5,B0014YF6ZA,Awesome. Thanks.,1522886400,,16,7.5
8256607,5,B0014YF6ZA,This saved my life! I took Calc 3 during the summer and this helped me get an A in the class! Just having the extra problems to practice is worth it!,1370476800,,149,3.838709677419355
8256608,5,B0014YF6ZA,"The disk set arrived after being on order for less than three weeks.  It was packaged well and no damage was noticed on any of the DVDs.  I haven't actually started using this specific training program yet,  but that will be happening by the end of 2013.",1363305600,,254,4.361702127659575
8256609,5,B0014YF6ZA,"Multivariable calculus (whether your school calls it Calc III or Calc IV) is probably the hardest class in the sequence to figure out.  You are applying the concepts from single variable calculus but adding another dimension to it.  So instead of doing a single integral you have to do double and triple integrals.  If you know how much of a pain doing single variable integrals are, they only get worse.  Jason's step by step example approach makes Calc III much easier than it would normally be.  My teacher, while a good lecturer, tended to focus more on theory and proofs in his lectures than the nuts and bolts of problem solving.  And the book I was stuck with was totally useless.  It would give three, maybe four examples of the easiest problems then give you 50-70 problems to figure out on your own.  This is where I turned to actually figure out HOW to solve the problems.  Even if though some of my homework problems did not match exactly with the problems Jason did, I at least had the knowledge to get started and could usually figure it out from there.

I did get an A in the class, but I had to work harder for it than in any other class.  Even between volumes 1 and 2 there is still material that Jason did not get to here.  The problems he picks are the ones that could most reasonably be asked on a test.  The problems can get much, much harder than the ones on this DVD.  Depending on your teacher, you may get the harder ones as exam questions.  What this will do is give you the foundation in the concepts and show you the process of doing things like taking partial derivatives, setting up and solving double and triple integrals and using Green's and Stokes' theorems.  More than with any other class you cannot try to get by with just these problems.  You have to go to class, take notes, do homework problems, any practice tests your teacher gives etc.  If I had just relied on these to learn (as opposed to reenforce) the concepts I could have probably got by with a C (maybe) but I would not have got an A.  If used the right way this will be the best investment you can make in a supplement that explains the material in plain english, does not assume you know more than you do, and walks you through the problems step-by-step, even the steps you probably know how to do at this level and would be allowed to skip on an exam.",1341014400,4,2354,4.345537757437071
8256610,5,B0014YF6ZA,"Jason takes a long time to do problems and is thorough but I did not find this to be the most valuable part of the videos.  It's the part at the front of each lesson that I value. He is very good at explaining WHAT you are doing, which most math professors have trouble doing.  if you don't understand conceptually what you are doing, you can still do the problems and get a good grade, but you won't remember any of it a year later, or know when to use what you do remember.  In other words, you paid several hundred (thousand?) dollars and can't actually use what you ""learned"" to solve any real life problems.

If you understand the concepts, it becomes easy to know what you need to do.  You don't need to memorize formulas or steps to solve problems because it is obvious what you need to do.  You also don't forget easily.

This is the first math professor I have come across who could explain math concepts clearly. Many of my professors didn't even KNOW what it was they were doing, and most eventually admitted it just to get me to stop rephrasing my question of ""why are we doing this and what is it giving us?"" They just knew that if you have a certain type of problem you follow these specific steps to solve it. I have found it best to go to physicists with my math questions because they seem to be able to explain math concepts in a much clearer manner than mathematicians.

The concepts of Calculus truly are easy to understand if explained clearly.  If not explained clearly, you will struggle mightily with the math and never get the ""ah-ha!"" moments.

Had to order his Diff EQ videos.  No math professor I have come across has been able to even start explaining what is going on with that subject.  The standard answer to conceptual questions is ""this is just what you do when you have this type of problem"".",1336089600,5,1827,4.372781065088757
8256611,5,B0014YF6ZA,"I own almost all of Jason's DVDs and have enjoyed the benefit of self-teaching privately at home with these wonderful video programs along with my Problem Solver and Humongous Book of... books. I don't need to go to class and I don't have to worry about the embarrasment of asking for more than a couple of repeat explanations if I'm having a particularly ""dense day"". I simply push a couple of buttons and my friend Jason repeats the explanation. How cool is that? I, like many others, enjoy Jason's lucid, relaxed and pleasant style of presenting the sometimes challenging concepts of mathematics.

The Calculus 3 Tutor is no exception. Five-stars excellent!",1310601600,2,660,4.945945945945946
8256612,5,B0014YF6ZA,"I wrote a review for the Calculus 3, Volume 1 DVD set, and my review for Volume 2 is pretty much the same.  Nothing fancy, just a guy in front of a white board, giving a clear, concise explanation of math.  Volume 2 has the BEST explanation of line integrals that I've ever heard or read.  The instructor seems to have a particular enthusiasm for this material (I guess that is because his area of expertise is electrical engineering).  Two thumbs up, five stars, A+.  Buy this if you need help with Calc 3 or want a refresher.  Outstanding.",1256688000,,541,4.414141414141414
8256613,4,B0014YF6ZA,"This DVD series is an excellent support for Precalculus and Calculus.  Is this the right choice for you, though?  You must consider whether or not you want to learn Calculus or be entertained.  The presenter is not very entertaining - not boring, but hey, he's trying to present Calculus.  Many videos are just a little less expensive but for 30 minute to one hour of instruction.  These videos provide 10-14 hours of instruction.  So $ for $ I found these extremely helpful compared to others.

If you do not have the option of video-recording your professor or having access to other on-line Calculus video lectures, this is a great supplement for the serious student who can ignore the speaker continually saying ""ok"" (a bit annoying - 30 times per hour) and who doesn't mind this being like a videotaped lecture.

The presentation of the topics is usually pretty clear.  It's great being able to rewind sections.  I even occasionally ran the DVD at 1.5 and 2X speed to get through review sections faster.

Hopefully in the next several years there will be enough of these presentations on line for free by various professors - but if you're taking calculus now then go for this one today.

Definitely look at Calculus 3 Volume 1 as well if you're considering this multivariable Caclulus video.",1215820800,5,1297,4.792792792792793
8256614,5,B0014YF6ZA,"I have purchased all videos in Jason's calculus series.  Every single one of them is excellent!  The video comes packaged nicely, and I swear he ships these things out faster than FedEx!

I am in calc 3 right now, and have been using this video concurrently with the course, every step of the way.  Its great to be able to come home, pop in the dvd and basically rewatch what you learned in school that day.

Several sections on disk 2 have really helped me get through some sticky areas... Line Integrals I would've absolutely bombed without this dvd... and the section on Greens theorem saved me as well... If you are having any issues in class, or better yet starting calc 3 next semester - GRAB THESE DVD's!  You will not be dissappointed!",1209513600,8,743,4.507462686567164
