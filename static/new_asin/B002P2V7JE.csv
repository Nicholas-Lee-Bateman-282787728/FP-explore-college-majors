8376557,1,B002P2V7JE,"This copy is not the copy in the add photo~ This edition has NO cover art....clear plastic cover. DVD is grainy, completely unwatchable....Toss it in the trash. I found the exact same DVD as in the photograph on another internet venue. Guess which one.? This copy is not good enough for anyone let alone a gift. Wake up amazon .I would give it ZERO Stars but the lowest is Zero. Toss in the trash or better yet READ the reviews before you buy. I will.",1466294400,4,451,4.317647058823529
8376558,1,B002P2V7JE,Horrible copy.  No cover or disk art.  Obvious bootleg.  Not what is shown in the listing.  This was to be a gift.  Not even worth sending it back.,1449532800,5,147,4.107142857142857

8376560,1,B002P2V7JE,"The quality of this product is the worst that I have ever purchased from Amazon. The DVD pack bears no resemblance to the photo shown on the page - it is a plain DVD case with no sleeve or cover, no photo. The caveat belatedly written at the end of the description provides no defence against the charge of deceptive advertising. In addition, the film itself is unwatchable - it appears to be a third generation home-produced copy burned onto a blank DVD available from any office supplies store. The film itself is fuzzy and blurred to the point of being out-of-focus. All in all, this is a real amateur attempt and I feel conned to the degree that I have reported this lot to Amazon and am seeking a refund under the distance selling regulations. AVOID!",1406592000,8,755,4.518248175182482
8376561,4,B002P2V7JE,This is a great vintage mystery set in Pre-WWII England. Alistar Sim plays comic relief as the bumbling assistant. The inspector is an avid stamp collector and many of his lines represent allusions to stamp collecting. I am looking forward to obtaining the other two movies in the series.,1256083200,8,288,4.8979591836734695
