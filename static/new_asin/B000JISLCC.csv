8150436,4,B000JISLCC,"Gorgeous pictures, pleasant voices, only thing is, it does not flow. It starts with an intro to what the rosary is. You can skip this. Then it does the first prayers, then stops. You have to cue it to go into your choice of joyful, sorrowful, etc mysteries and decades of 'Hail Mary's. Then you need to cue the prayers after the rosary. So, if this is for, say, a sick person, you can't just start it and go away. You have to 'baby sit' and cue the next phase. I needed one requiring minimal cueing for elderly bed ridden individuals.",1482969600,3,534,4.297029702970297
