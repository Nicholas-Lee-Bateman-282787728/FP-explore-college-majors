I enjoyed following Will's well-written character.  Don Wood does a fine job portraying a man who hesitantly comes to grips with both his newfound ""eating disorder,"" and the invasion of space that comes with re-acquainting oneself with those nightmarish once-were relationships of rural life.

A great cast all around, a story that doesn't give too much away too quickly, and a very trendy pair of...no, no I can't give away the best part.

""YOU!  It's what's for dinner.""",1123804800,2,736,4.943089430894309
7983057,5,B00008G8QS,"If you like your blood fests served up with a dash of dry wit and a side of social commentary, then this film is for you. Gory, smart, funny and sometimes surreal, Canniballistic is the story of a man struggling with his own demons in a world that just can't take a hint.

If you've seen 'Colonial House' on PBS, you may be surprised to see Freeman Don Wood here as the main protagonist, the one who dines on human flesh. Fans of the British TV series 'Doctor Who' will also get a treat in the form of that show's 'Sgt. Benton' as a television self help guru.

No, this isn't 'Cannibal Ferox' or 'Cannibal Holocaust'. So if you're looking for that sort of thing, this will not be for you. If you are a fan of the delightfully dark film 'Parents' or like your John Waters with a touch of HG Lewis, then Canniballistic may be just what you are looking for.",1122336000,2,854,4.233128834355829
7983058,4,B00008G8QS,I was surprised at how much I liked it. I haven't really gotten into independent or low budge films but this movie has definitely changed that. It wasn't an your face gore but it gives you just enough to sit there with your hand over your mouth in grossed out amazement.,1122336000,2,270,4.313725490196078
7983059,3,B00008G8QS,"If you have seen Shaun Of The Dead, you should check this movie out. While it is an entirely different film, it shares the former film's ability to blend comedy, tongue in cheek horror and a nice helping of satire into a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

The film stars Don Wood (who also co-scripted with the director)as Will, a former executive, who returns to his family home in rural Maine after the death of his parents. Once there, Will is reacquainted with the friends of his youth who all rent homes on the large expanse of woodland property that was left to him; Henna (played by the hilarious Turquoise Taylor Grant), Peggy (Laura Sweeney), and Gene (Winston Bramen).

Will is the sole voice of reason in this motley crew. Henna is a small town girl who at some point got a taste of City life and dreams of her return to New York, far away from the hicks she is surrounded by. Taylor-Grant perfectly captures the speech and gestures of a woman who thinks she belongs in an art gallery in Chelsea when she actually belongs in an asylum for the criminally annoying. Peggy is (in my mind) the former high school home-coming queen who never gave Will the slightest bit of attention but is rethinking it now that he is the only successful, attractive man within 20 miles. And there's Gene. We all have known a Gene, he will either make you laugh out loud or cringe, depending upon your perspective. Peggy and Gene would fit in well with Henna at the asylum whatever she may think of their class differences.

Will's return to his home and to this David Lynchish (or possibly John Waters) group is prompted by a traumatic accident and his method of survival of that accident. Now a pacifist and vegetarian, he is wary of contact with people (which doesn't help Peggy's already awkward attempts at seduction), finding that even the smell of them bothers him. His attempts to avoid them and to deny his increasing lust for meat is thwarted by them at every turn. In desperation, he checks out self help videos from the local library. Enter Bernie Shanks.

Bernie Shanks, played by John Anthony Blake of Dr. Who fame, is the host of Motivation Through Moderation. A video that stresses that we should not deny ourselves the things we crave; we merely need to exercise moderation. Buy a pound of that favorite snack and divide it into reasonable portions to freeze for future treats. This is the moment of Will's revelation, and one of my favorite moments of the film. With his newfound sense of purpose and peace of mind, Will proceeds to stock his freezer for the winter and does so with wit and satire, ""microwave French toast, now that's insane."" I couldn't agree more.

The film, which was cleverly directed by James Felix McKenney, with David Hale as D of P, is not without flaws. There are scenes that were shortened or cut altogether that leave slight gaps in the story and the sound is not great, despite a well written score. But, the DVD includes deleted scenes so the viewer can fill in the gaps and next year a re-mastered, re-edited DVD is slated to be released. The original DVD can be found cheaply on e-Bay and half.com, but be sure to search Cannibalistic and CanniBallistic! since it appears as both. The Monsterpants team's second film, ""The Off Season"", is currently available at Amazon.com. As of this writing, two more films, ""Death To The Automatons"" and ""Satan Hates You"" are in pre-production.
