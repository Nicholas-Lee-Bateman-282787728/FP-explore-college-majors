8013487,1,B0001K2KXE,I did not know what was meant by region 2 and it is a worthless purchase because it does not play in my region which I have learned is 1 These dvd should not be allowed to be listed with region 1,1359244800,7,195,3.6666666666666665
8013488,1,B0001K2KXE,Probably not vendor's fault but this international format will not play on either of my two DVD players.  I did not see any mention on the website but I was not looking as I assumed it was the USA format.,1302048000,5,204,4.1
