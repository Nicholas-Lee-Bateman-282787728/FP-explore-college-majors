7753857,5,B01G43HHNO,"I was so excited this series got revived on Netflix. We've been watching this show from the beginning & the writing and acting are topnotch. I was so angry when A&E cancelled it despite good ratings. Makes no sense to me. I like crime procedurals/murder mysteries etc, so I added this to out TIVO to do list & never looked back. It's really excellent. If you're looking for a show with explosions & all the cast are overly model looking 20-somethings with a convoluted plot, this show is not for you. The people are very real and they don't force a zillion overly dramatic plots in one episode. It can even be a little laid back, but fascinating and worth following all the way. It takes place in Wyoming, in a semi rural area near a reservation. There always seems to be some tension between the Native Americans & just about everyone else, as they like to keep to themselves & deal with their own issues. Those issues sometimes spill over outside the reservation & issues outside the reservation sometimes spill in. The Sheriff Longmire is a bit of a technophobe. It's a bit of an ongoing annoyance with others, esp as he doesn't carry a cellphone. He's friends with running Bear, played by Lou Diamond Phillips. Their longstanding friendship is believable and wonderful to watch. If you like crime shows, Westerns or just really good dramas, you should check this show out.",1464912000,144,1376,4.666666666666667
7753858,5,B01G43HHNO,"My sister was the one who turned me on to this series,  and I have loved and appreciated it just as much as she ever since.  The characters and the acting are so natural and superb and you really have feelings for them!  The filming is so superb!  It is slow moving so you can really see the gorgeous country where the stories take place.  The drama is always developing and there are plenty of surprises.  It is an EXTRAORDINARY Series.",1464652800,83,437,4.333333333333333

7753900,2,B01G43HHNO,"My wife and I have read all of the Craig Johnson Longmire mysteries and pre-order them when a new one is pending publication.  How this series with Mr. Johnsons involvement has turned into such a muddled mess is inexplicable as are the numerous 5-star reviews here.  We keep hoping it will get better and each season just brings more disappointment.

  Any attempts to follow the books have long been abandoned and Johnsons well developed characters are hijacked by the writers and transformed into unrecognizable people.  Also unlike the books where Walt & Co solve actual mysteries and crimes this show is basically a soap opera.  The script relies on interpersonal relationship drama to drive the story, crime stopping only when time permits.  To be fair Season 4 attempts to turn the corner and the first couple episodes wrap up the tedious tale of the Connally family and gets back to some crime busting.

  How the writers with such a deep well of source material and characters so richly drawn consistently fail to capture their personalities is a mystery worthy of the sheriffs investigation.  Some poor casting continues to drag the show down.  Lou Diamond Phillips is way too petite to play Henry Standing Bear.  Actually the actor who plays one of Malachis henchmen, Darius (Joseph Daniel Avila) would be a perfect Standing Bear.  Hes big, has long hair, and is scary, all things Mr. Phillips is not.  In this series Henry is so hapless and such a consistent victim he should be renamed Henry Crawling Chicken or something more appropriate.  He makes incredibly poor decisions and winds up shot, beaten up and in miserable situations.  The way hes written this is the sort of part that would have gone to Don Knotts or Jerry Lewis back in the day.  The notion that Henry would lose ownership of the Red Pony bar to some scumbag is laughable.

  And theres Vic Moretti.  Katee Sackhoffs portrayal is too whiny and shes not quite the knockout described in the books.  She has her moments but the sum of her character doesnt add up to the dynamo undersheriff that readers have come to know.  Cassidy Freeman as Walts daughter Cady also falls short.  Instead of the finest legal mind in the country and big city lawyer we have her moping around town waiting tables at the Red Pony and finally taking on some pro bono work on the rez.

  On the good side the show actually improves a few things; first is dropping the creepy and inappropriate Walt and Vic May/December romance; Walt doesnt commune with the spirits of dead Native Americans; and the superhero level of physical abuse that Walt endures in the books is dialed back to believable levels.  All said and done I don't think I can watch anymore, its just too aggravating.",1515715200,,2736,4.747346072186836

7753918,5,B01G43HHNO,"This was the first season that Longmier was not on AMC and was over on Net Flex so I couldn't view it in real time.  I was so delighted to see CD's made since I have the CD's for Seasons 1,2,3.  This  season was extremely good with lots of action and interchange between people.  Quwastions were answered but others were brought up.  Branch died, Walt got a little revenge for his wife's death without breaking the law to do so.  Henry lost ownership of the Red Pony through his own stupid promise which he was dumb enough to keep even though he didn't actually get the answers he wanted.  The best of friends for 30 plus years Walt Longmier and Henry Standing Bear had a falling out which made it even more interesting.  Up until now they have worked together with no problems, except for Henry's dry sense of humor which in itself makes the show, but seeing them at odds with each other was even more interesting.  At the end of this season's CD's I couldn't wait for the 5th season's to come out and the second I saw them on Amazon I orderedt.  This is a really great series one the entire family can watch with the exception of perhaps one or two episodes.",1509408000,,1160,4.328703703703703

Season 4, however, is really dark and the main characters are all acting very much out of character.  Even calling it acting is a stretch.  I'm not sure how much more I can take.

7753970,5,B01G43HHNO,"Wife and I watched all four seasons over two weeks.  Both of us are fans of westerns and I think Walt Longmire is a modern day version of sheriff Will Kane in the movie 'High Noon'.  His feminine opposite is his deputy 'Vic' - who will never be confused with the Grace Kelly role in 'High Noon"".  I really enjoy watching her exchanges with the sheriff and other deputies.  Watched the fifth season recently and enjoyed it - Lou Diamond Phillips and the Native American issues are interesting.  Not sure how far they'll go with that in the sixth and final season.  Other star in the season is the western scenery which I think they could show more often.  Of course it's New Mexico, not Wyoming.  Do people from Wyoming get upset about that I wonder?",1501459200,,749,4.455882352941177

7754035,5,B01G43HHNO,"Season four of Longmire contains 10 episodes, all a few longer (approximately one hour in length) than those from previous seasons.  In this season the balance shifts from standalone story lines to overarching plot arcs, chiefly focusing on the personal lives of the shows principal characters.  One major story line is resolved (the individual[s] responsible for the death of Martha Longmire) and a set of new story lines are developed.  For example, Hector is dead and one of the characters takes on his role in seeking justice for a woman who is a victim of rape.

In some ways season four feels transitional, particularly with a crescendo ending in episode ten that leaves us looking at multiple cliffhangers.  The overall quality remains very highthe season is strong in scripts, strong in acting and strong in production values.  The sense of drama, often resulting from dark forms of injustice, has been heightened.  This is a more-than-worthy successor to the dazzling series three.

Highly recommended.",1489881600,,1011,5.159509202453988

7754089,5,B01G43HHNO,"Longmire has been one of our favorites since it's debut and our very favorite of the crime/police genre ever since Justified ended.  We're grateful that Warner keeps supporting this series on Blu-ray, as DVD couldn't begin to deliver the crystal clear video that this series demonstrates - some of the most gorgeously resolved scenery I've witnessed shy of 4K demo loops.  Being part of their Warner Archive Line, Longmire is pricier than most Warner TV seasons and never seems to go on sale. But, despite an utter drought of extras, Warner treats the show like HBO does Game of Thrones, encoding only a few episodes per disc, rather than a half dozen or more.  The video doesn't look as filtered as most Blu-rays do these days.  We can't wait for the next season!",1487894400,,764,4.7218045112781954

7754174,5,B01G43HHNO,"Watched the show from Day 1. LOVE. It. But, watch from the beginning because there are ""true"" character arcs. The ONLY thing I don't like is there don't seem to be ANY behind-the-scenes goodies as with previous ""Longmire"" dvds. But, the storylines & character conflicts are great. If you like crime dramas but don't care for all the guts & gore of ""CSI"" & the like, this show is a welcome relief. A thinking person's entertainment. Plus, an Aussie plays a cowboy sheriff with pitch perfect precision with an AWESOME supporting cast. Enjoy!",1484179200,4,539,4.806451612903226
7754175,5,B01G43HHNO,"This is the best season of Longmire yet. It is so action packed and not typical that I would often say, ""WHAT?"" as each episode ended! I would need a few minutes for it all to compute before I could say anything else. Every character in this series is in some ""situation"" as the season starts and is fully resolved by the end of the season. Alliances are made and some are broken and made again. You will believe who does and doesn't become allies. Ferg does get a bigger part in the police station - finally! I can not say much else without giving away too much. If you like Longmire - then this is a must watch season.",1484179200,,620,4.175

7754195,1,B01G43HHNO,"What in the world has happened to this once terrific series?  Are this season's writers even cognizant of what made Longmire such a compelling character?  He is supposed to be authoritative, smart,  shrewd in his investigations, and understanding of his colleagues.  In this season, he is none of these things, spending most of his time thrashing about until the solution to the so-called mysteries of this season are dropped in his lap, usually by someone else.  The stretching of story lines into 2 and more episodes is tiresome with little pay-off.  And the dismal re-shaping of Henry into a bitter and narcissistic vigilante is inexcusable.  Unbelievably, the once self-assured and bright Vic is transformed into a simpering, love-sick hanger on!  I can't believe how these great characters have been trashed!  Aside from this, the quality of the writing is ridiculous, with some of the most idiotic dialog to be heard.  This crew of re-run writers need to be scrapped pronto.  Otherwise, Longmire has truly expired.",1483660800,4,1020,5.121212121212121
7754196,5,B01G43HHNO,Absolutely love Longmire. What an engaging cast in this series. I'm hoping there's a fifth season.,1483660800,,98,5.1875

7754209,1,B01G43HHNO,"I have watched all seasons of Longmire, and frankly I think the quality has gone down with each one.
The first season was great, there was the running story of Walt's wife and her murder, BUT, what I really loved was that each episode focused on a specific crime/mystery.  It was much more interesting than the almost total focus on Walt's ongoing personal troubles.
Don't get me wrong, I love that aspect of the show, I just wish it would expand to other areas.  Go back to the season 1 format, please!",1483315200,2,503,4.456521739130435

7754213,4,B01G43HHNO,"Great show, good cast. I miss this show when it left cable. Longmire is an underated show. It has mystery , humor and very good acting",1483228800,,134,4.1923076923076925
7754214,3,B01G43HHNO,"I am about 4 episodes into this new season.  For fans of this show, as I am, I don't think I could talk anyone out of this 4th season, nor would I necessarily want to.  The end of season 3 was quite a cliffhanger.  Most fans of the show will want to have that resolved.

A couple of observations: the first two episodes were not nearly as well-written as the previous seasons.  I was quite frankly shocked at the writing.  The directing could have been better, as some of the characters did not come off quite as true to their persona.

As you all know, there were quite a number of unfinished plot lines and threads running through the series.  Expect all of your questions to be answered in very short order.  Whereas, many of the plot points could and probably should have been worked through over a set of 2-4 episodes, the majority of them come to light very early on, somewhat suddenly.  All of a sudden, all your questions are answered.  I personally think that it should have been teased more and drawn out more, so that the viewer enjoys the ride.  My impression was, the writers had a set of new plot lines that they wanted to pursue, so completing past plot threads suddenly allowed them to move forward.

There are a few new characters, a few characters get bumped, and some old characters get more screen time.  All that is normal in a series.  For me, it was somewhat of a bumpy ride.  There are some characters who are introduced, who make quite an impression, but apparently will not play a part in future episodes.

The camera work is more clever in some episodes; but not in a way that it better tells the story, but more in the way like a cameraman thought of another cool way to focus in on a scene, and so they do that.  It is my opinion that you ought not notice the camera work.

I reserve the right to come back here and finish this review once I finish the series.  The writing seems to improve with episodes 3 and 4; but it is still not up to the standards of the first 3 seasons.

I would imagine that most people who like this series will like season 4.  So far, I like it; just not as much as before.",1483228800,,2129,4.256857855361596
7754215,5,B01G43HHNO,"Truthfully, I didn't care for the dark places that Starz took the show before cancelling it at the end of season 3. I bought season 4 as a gift for the husband and we loved it! Netflix did an amazing job! I felt that they gave some life back to the characters and gave us something good to root for. This series is a great modern day western. We love cowboy hats, Indian Country, justice, 24 County and Craig Johnson. (The opossum scene! We don't have opossoms! But, it was great anyway).  Looking forward to Season 5 and more books.",1483228800,,533,4.33
7754216,5,B01G43HHNO,"I'm generally not a fan of TV drama series, so it was with some hesitation that I began watching Longmire (beginning with season 1).  I am absolutely hooked on this series!  Season four was exceptionally good, with more surprises than some of the earlier seasons, some which I never would have expected, and quite took me aback.  I MUST have season five!

7754217,5,B01G43HHNO,"If you haven't seen Longmire before and you like modern western this is the show for you. It is set in a small town in a rural area and has great plot and story and  characters, not to mention, ongoing character development and evolving plots and subplots. In short it has a real life feel to it that you almost never find in movies and TV shows anymore. Binged watched the whole season over a weekend and wanted more. It is as good as breaking bad maybe better.",1483228800,,462,4.25

Walt Longmire is a complex man.  Surrounded by both friends and foes.  He is trying to solve an ongoing string of events related to the death of his wife...and other people in his life.  His journey takes him to unexpected places...and connects him with unusual characters.

Longmire is a man's man.  He is a cowboy for today...but he would be equally at home, in the old west.  His ruggedness and loyalty, also appeals to women!",1482278400,2,522,4.797752808988764

I haven't (yet) read the books, so can't speak on the translation, but the TV drama is superb, hitting all the right notes with tone, setting, and character. With Walt somewhat moving on from the murder of his wife, but with some questions still lingering, and another death of someone close to begin the series, Sheriff Longmire and his team move onto fresh troubles in the latest series. A Cheyenne vigilante is resurrected, past enemies grow stronger, and the are plenty of troubles brewing in Absaroka County. Gritty and addictive.",1481587200,,729,5.186440677966102

7754314,5,B01G43HHNO,"Was a bit miffed when A&E removed this great show from it's lineup. Nice to have it available on DVD since I don't subscribe to it's new streaming service. Just as good as the previous seasons - great stories, great characters, and it's nice to see the different characters continue with the same characteristics as in the original A&E series.",1480464000,,343,4.733333333333333
7754315,5,B01G43HHNO,Really like the Longmire series.  I think you need to make the sheriff show more love to his daughter.  Something is not right when Henry and Nighthawk show more concern for than her father.,1480377600,,190,4.5588235294117645
7754316,5,B01G43HHNO,We love Longmire and haven't missed one season. What I don't like is the only swear they used about a half dozen times total in this series: the GD word. I hate it!,1480291200,,164,4.0
7754317,3,B01G43HHNO,"Longmire held up pretty well through the first 3 seasons. Yeah, it was slow, sometimes stodgy, and always old-fashioned, but they did a clever job of stringing the major subplots along through multiple episodes and cliffhangers so that you got addicted. Its major flaw was the Lone Ranger and Tonto relationship of Longmire and Henry. Let's face it, Henry is a cartoon character, and an annoying one, and if Lou Diamond Phillips has an A game, he didn't bring it to this show. In Season 4 the writers, having wrapped up those subplots in the first 3 seasons, seem to have run out of new stories to tell. Henry is even more of a presence than in the past, and even more annoying. The season meanders and flounders and never grabs you the way the earlier ones did.",1480032000,,762,4.528985507246377

7754407,2,B01G43HHNO,"I'm glad I read the books before watching any of the show.  They are excellent.  I really enjoyed the show up to season 4.  I understand that as seasons go on the writers are going to have to work harder at coming up with new stories.  But, round about season 4 things started to devolve into a ridiculous number of over the top ""problems"" for virtually all of the characters.  More wackos, more violence, more over the stop storylines, just more more more of anything negative.  Season 5 is even worse with Walt's character devolving into a man who ALWAYS knows better than everyone else and into a man who has a God-complex.  Only Walt can see through all the ""lies"" and ""know"" the truth.  He is supposedly a high-minded person who follows the letter of the law, but he doesn't mind attacking his best friend (an Indian) and trying to rip off his shirt to get to ""evidence.""  All the while decrying people who take the law into their own hands because white man's law doesn't protect Indians as well as it does white people.  It's just too much over the top and too much to be asked to believe the ridiculous.  The season 5 finale cliffhangers are beyond belief.  As I started out saying at the beginning of my review, good acting and drama in the early seasons devolved into melodrama.  Ho hum.  Couldn't even get the least bit into it.  Hope there isn't a season 6.  It's all predictable...",1477699200,,1394,4.472222222222222

7754498,5,B01G43HHNO,"I originally bought the first Longmire season as a gift for my husband.  He never did get around to watching it, so finally a put in the DVD player and I was hooked.  I bought the next two seasons and loved them as well.  I had to wait a year before Netflix released Season Four in DVD format.  I was not disappointed.  The characters have evolved and the plot continues to intrigue.  If you are looking for a realistic, modern western, Longmire fits the bill.  The only bummer is I have to wait another year before Season Five is released.  By the way, I definitely recommend any new viewer to the series starts with the first season.",1477008000,,635,4.367521367521367

7754530,3,B01G43HHNO,"Longmire: The Complete Fourth Season is the 10-episode season that ran on Netflix, after premiering in June, 2012, and running three seasons on A & E. Based on the Longmire mystery novels by Craig Johnson set in Absaroka County, Wyoming, the show is a contemporary Western crime thriller with dark secrets. Now that the mysterious White Warrior who tormented Branch is dead, Sheriff Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor) and friends are ready to move on. Walts best friend, Henry Standing Bear (Lou Diamond Phillips), is a free man; deputy Victoria Vic Moretti (Katee Sackhoff) is newly divorced; and Walts wifes murder is seemingly resolved. But just when second chances seem possible for everyone, the Reservations new casino brings new trouble.

Season 4 episodes involve Walt investigating Jacob Nighthorses involvement in the death of Walts wife; a murder that coincides with the opening of the casino; an investigation into local oil workers raping a young native woman; the death of an oil rig worker shortly after being promoted; and Nighthorse offering Cody a job as legal representative for the Native Americans.

The show is notable for dealing with long-festering resentments among the local Cheyenne reservation community. Unlike many TV police and detective shows, the stories on Longmire are straightforward and avoid cumbersome subplots. Each episode focuses on the solution of a crime, though some dramatic arcs extend into two of more episodes.

There are no bonus features on the 4-disc unrated widescreen Blu-ray release.",1476835200,,1533,5.3264462809917354

7754594,5,B01G43HHNO,"Great show; a little violent. This fourth season had an ambiguous ending ... is it the last season? Does the protagonist die? Or is it a cliff hanger (and clearly Sheriff Longmire must live to have the show continue). The Native characters and integration of Native culture is one of the best aspects of this program. The scenery is also beautiful. I like the women who are cast. They are appealing, but not movie star beautiful, and they seem like real women, real people, with realistic motivations and behaviors. This show is in general respectful of everyone. However, one sour note - why is the female deputy derided for her way of relating to men? This seems like a sexist portrayal and interpretation of her behavior to me. She is struggling to find her way like all of the characters are. Why is her behavior judged on different standards than the men and the ""good"" women. Also, there is a lot of conflict. This makes for interesting story lines, but there are also a lot of moments of joy and this show could find a better balance.",1476230400,,1041,4.572192513368984

7754604,5,B01G43HHNO,"My wife and I are normally SciFi, Fantasy fans, but there is material out there that is watch worthy. What I like most is the examination of the clash between Native American culture with other cultures.  I have watched the Longmire series from the beginning, but since the series went ""off network"", the writing is better, the action more intense.

All of these characters are flawed.  They have a past, it affects their behavior, often to unintended consequences. Over time, those flaws are revealed, and gives us insight into those characters.

An interesting component is Native American mysticism, and how it influences many of their actions.  We also get an insight into what it is like to live on a reservation, keeping in mind, of course, that this is a TV show.

If you are going to watch this series, I recommend you start from the beginning.  I do not get Netflix.  It clearly appears that there will a fifth season, so I will have to wait for the FIfth Season DVDs.

I think you will enjoy it, but it may be too intense for children under 14.",1476057600,2,1054,4.5638297872340425

7754607,4,B01G43HHNO,"All in all, I enjoyed watching the episodes although not as much as I enjoyed the A&E episodes. The main characters return except for one and I'm sure that by now everyone knows who didn't come back.

The female characters, Vic and Cadie, seem much more emotional and weaker. I was expecting strong female characters since that's how Craig Johnson has written them, but for a few episodes in the middle of the season the women couldn't seem to do anything without falling apart and needing a man to tell them what to do next. And the Henry Standing Bear character has become the stereotypical American Indian character who needs a white man to help  him out of the jams he impulsively gets into. The heroic white man who helps everyone is of course Walt Longmire. Nothing wrong with Walt being the heroic cowboy sheriff except that it makes the series less enjoyable for me when the supporting characters are weak.

I'm not criticizing the actors since they get a script, learn their lines, rehearse and act. They can only work with what the storyline and script give them. Look, Vic is hot. There's no reason for her character to act so needy about having a man in her life.

 I'd rather see some bad guys get get chased down and caught. There is some of that in this season, but the format seems to require continuing lengthy sagas that may or may not be criminal. I don't want to see Longmire the series turn into a killer of the week like CSI did and many cop shows on broadcast TV still are. But isn't there a happy medium between killer of the week and soap opera? The series seems to aim for it but hasn't quite hit the bullseye yet.",1475971200,2,1640,4.4352159468438535

7754645,5,B01G43HHNO,"This one's right out of the park for me. Longmire's back and this time he's brought with him some new worthy characters and is spending some time with familiar ones. I really liked the way this season has shifted perspectives and is providing some worthy time on the reservation and giving us insights into the old hands. Without the slow development of the past three seasons, this one might not have worked so well. I just finished the last episode and it was tightly wound. All in all, this one's probably the definitive Longmire. Its got a few slower points, but then that sets us up for the roll that unwinds into episode ten. I especially liked the greater involvement of the reservation policeman, the ex-reservation policemen, and so on. The establishment of the Casino broadens the Longmire world and provides some motivation for a larger set of problem developments. Chances are good that if you liked Longmire before, you will love it now. And if you're just getting started, you will definitely be looking into getting the first three seasons!  This is high quality television drama, some of the best in decades. I don't think that ball has quite landed yet. It's right out of here! Many thanks to Netflix for taking a risk with this!",1475020800,8,1246,4.741935483870968

7754651,5,B01G43HHNO,"As a perspiring writer/storyteller, I seek nuanced, layered, yet powerful stories which strike inside the hearts & minds of it's characters.  Stories which explore a deeper pathos than the typical, dramas so common within network/cable shows.  Walt Longmire is ""everyman"" in his struggle to forge forward with life, after picking up the pieces of an untimely, mysterious death of his spouse (No spoilers.)

He copes the best he can, as all of us would in his situation.  However, the strains of his job, the powers which come with it, along with his complicated interpersonal relationship with his Deputy (Vic played by Katy Sackoff) as well as the presures exerted by Knighhorse and his minions begin to mount.  ""Longmire"" is a contemporary 21st Century Greek Tragedy set in an iconic, American West.

It's a show with all the twists/turns of a detective procedural, within a slow, simmering pot, filled with a stew of siney, suspicious characters.  All of whom are circling each other, awaiting the moment to strike it's prey.  This is one of the best shows I've seen, and hope it's audience can expand, as well as it's web of plots & subplots.

It's a joy to indulge in a show/story which one can not predict, nor guess which direction the path the story will lead.  It's a show which mimicks the unpredictability of life, within the constrains of a 1hr Drama, squeazing the characters towards their breaking point, without feeling forced or overtly executed.

Enjoy the saga ~ !",1474761600,,1482,4.888

7754660,5,B01G43HHNO,"Season Four is as good or better than the first three seasons.  The cast, script and moving story of an independent, insightful sheriff is presented with enough pause, to grasp the meaning and appreciate each development throughout.  I have now watch the entire Season Four in the past two weeks.  There is a lot of meaningful interaction by the characters.  Virtually no wasted ""filler"" script, whatever is left puzzling, is realistically brought together, as the story moves along.  I am hopeful that they will offer a Season Five.  The Sheriff finally has a lady friend who is a medical doctor, who brings new life to the story, since the Sheriff lost his wife several years earlier, by terminal cancer and possible a homicide.",1474588800,3,730,4.894308943089431
7754661,5,B01G43HHNO,"I just finished watching the whole Season 4 and am so pleased with this show once again.  Also very happy that they didn't go in a certain direction that seemingly lots of viewers were wishing for.

SPOILER ALERT: I'm only a so-so fan of the Vic character, mostly for comic relief, and almost couldn't believe that some fans at the end of previous seasons hoped to see Vic and Walt get together in a relationship. My opinion was that it'd ruin the show. To my mind, Vic's too immature, slightly masculine, and has that whole tough chick thing going to be someone Walt would actually fall for. Thankfully, they didn't go there.  Thank you, Thank you.

I won't spoil any more for you....This season was just as good as the three previous seasons, with a few new characters and surprises. And of course it ends on a major cliffhanger....Eeek. It's too long a wait til the next season comes out on DVD. As always, superb acting, wonderful characters, really good writing, filming and beautiful scenery.

This is my favorite show, no doubt. I'm also a big fan of Justified (so sorry they ended that show), Elementary, Sherlock, and a couple of British dramas. Longmire's my favorite, though.  Good contemporary Western mysteries and good family entertainment.",1474588800,,1254,4.809302325581395
7754662,5,B01G43HHNO,"great ! I have been waiting for season four to come to DVD ever since it was removed from TV at the end of season 3 .
that was nothing but a bad event for fans of Longmire it was almost like a slap in the face to older TV viewers as they said they wanted to replace it with a new show to appeal to younger audiences. I no longer watch that station. The Longmire DVD is a great DVD picking up where season 3 left off sharp picture and great settings with Robert Taylor giving a great performance of the character of Sheriff Longmire.

Thanks Amazon for providing us with this chance to view this wonderful series . I hope there will be further seasons to look forward too.

I admit that I was not too sure if Netflix would keep the same overall flavor as the first 3 seasons. But happily they did! This is somewhat different from most ""adult"" westerns as it lack the graphic and gratuitus sex,language and violence most of them have.

I better understand some things. I can't wait for Friday (Sept 23) to get here - NETFLIX will air season 5 then. To rationalize it's monthly cost, I set up my PC with decent speakers and will enjoy that season at my desk - until they print that season and Amazon sells it! Lots to watch on NETFLIX but I still like having my own copy to watch on either my home theater set-up or my small spare room unit. I will add that the photography is  as good as ever, as are the story lines and continuity. Great entertainment. I hope they continue with a season 6, 7, ...

7754699,1,B01G43HHNO,"Mostly Baloney. Very disappointed, especially by the star, Robert Taylor, who relies too more on hat and boots than solid acting. This Australian is too out of shape for his age to be playing his semi-physical role. Older, thinner guy would be a big improvement. I feel like smacking his unshaven face and whoever did the casting for this rag. Taylor's fight scenes are a joke as are most of the action scenes. As for the other actors about the only thing Katee Sackhoff has going for is a spectacular figure. She'd be well-suited to dancing in a club somewhere. Worst is this show's dialogue that sounds like it was written by teenagers. Having spent quite a bit of time in the Sheridan/Buffalo, WY area I can say that the real locals are clearly not the losers portrayed in this show. Everyone outside Longmire's snotty, clever staff seems to be a hopeless dolt, except of course, Lou Diamond Philips who plays the all-knowing, philosophical Cheyenne gin mill owner who repeatedly helps Longmire for no pay. Come to think of it Longmire never even seems to pay for his beers! This phony baloney series isn't even filmed in Wyoming which should offend WY residents as much as the way their lifestyle is been ""stylized"" to impress unsuspecting viewers who haven't spent any time in the real west. Three episodes was enough for me, that gritty guitar adds to the cartoon aura. Can't hold a candle to 'Blue Bloods' for quality and realism.",1470009600,,1437,4.729083665338646

Everyone is back, no one was dropped from the series. That's all I am going to say, as I do not want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen the show. I highly urge anyone who has not seen any of the Longmire's that you get Netflix and watch all four seasons, or better yet, buy them here on Amazon, you'll be glad you did, I know I am.
