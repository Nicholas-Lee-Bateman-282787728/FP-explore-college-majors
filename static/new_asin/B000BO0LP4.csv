2430805,2,B000BO0LP4,"30 years ago I thought the show was mildly humerous, seeing the DVD now shows just how ridulous it was with it's corn ball humor.  Would probably only appeal to our redneck population.",1303776000,,184,4.575757575757576
2430806,5,B000BO0LP4,"**SPOILER ALERT**

In this episode of the show we have Dolly Parton as the major guest star. She performs ""Love Is Like a Butterfly"" and ""I Will Always Love You"". Dolly doesn't appear in any of the skits but she does salute her hometown. The rest of the musical numbers are performed by the cast. Buck Owens performs a giggly ""Long, Tall Texan"" due to the Buckaroo's bopping up and down behind him. Roy Clark, Grandpa Jones, Roni Stoneman, Buck Trent, and Bobby Thompson all perform a banjo number.

The Hager Twins perform ""Once In a Lifetime"", Kenny Price sings ""Que Pasa"" which is a romantic ballad but Kenny's performance is comical in places. Barbi Benton performs the song ""Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep"". Roy Clark performs ""Gentle On My Mind"", the Glen Campbell hit. George Lindsey appears doing one-liners as he often did when he wasn't playing the Goober role on the show. Harmonica session player Terry McMillan appears and performs a harmonica solo.

Buck returns to perform another song, ""Games People Play"".

A few of the jokes...

Q: Do you know what a bonehead is?
A: Yes...it's someone who's ""marrow"" minded.

Q: Archie, do you plan on remaining a bachelor all your life?
A: Of course...I plan on staying foot loose and fiance free.

Archie Campbell, much like Minnie Pearl and Jerry Clower, had this ability to draw people into their stories. It didn't matter how old the jokes were or how many times a routine was performed, the timing was razor sharp.

Example...on this DVD Junior Samples visits Archie's barbershop in this episode and Archie insists that he can make a little rabbit appear on Junior's head. Junior questions this but Archie insists he can. Archie utters some ""magical"" phrases which include funny sounding towns like Pascagoula, Mississippi. Junior still questions whether or not a rabbit has appeared on his head. Archie tells him to rub his head and feel for himself. Junior rubs his head and Archie looks down at him and says a very funny joke that I don't want to spoil for anyone that hasn't bought the DVD and may not already know the punchline.

As a previous reviewer mentioned, this DVD doesn't contain ""Pffft...You Was Gone!!"". That is the song where the singer's blow raspberries in each others faces at the end of the song. Pffft is the spelling of the raspberry sound. I had commented to another reviewer about this DVD before I bought it...wondering how the skit could be left off the episode...but it's not here. This was a rarity for me...it's probably one of the few if not the ONLY episode that didn't feature the ""You Was Gone!!"" song.",1238371200,4,2590,4.725055432372505
2430807,5,B000BO0LP4,"Dolly Parton's charisma and personality shine through in this fabulous episode of HEE-HAW. Growing up watching the show and being a huge Dolly fan, this was a must have. If you enjoy country humor and music then buy right away. It is refreshing to watch really creative television from a time before reality tv and trash shows.

2430808,4,B000BO0LP4,"I loved this item, but I was a little disappointed.  The picture on the front shows Archie Campbell and Gordie Tapp ready to sing ""Pfft you were gone"", but the song is nowhere on the DVD.  I feel the picture was quite misleading, but with ""Gloom, Despair, and Agony on me"" and the gossip session, this DVD was still worth the money.",1139356800,15,332,4.338709677419355

My father is 90 years old and has Alzheimer's. We purchased 3 Hee Haw CDs for him, because it was his favorite show in the past. He thoroughly enjoys them.
