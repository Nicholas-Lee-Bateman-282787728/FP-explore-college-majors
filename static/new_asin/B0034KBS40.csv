In it he outlines 15 ideas which anyone can apply to save some time during their busy working day. It's accompanied by a workbook which summarises the 15 tips, a great idea to keep the tips fresh in your mind after watching the DVD and something I found myself coming back to on a regular basis.

Jason is an engaging speaker and held my attention throughout this presentation. He clearly explains how to apply each of the 15 tips to the work that you do and the accompanying slides and graphics ensure you understand the nuances of his ideas.

Over the years I've seen many complicated time management ideas come and go. Complicated, complex systems usually fail because of the amount of effort needed to implement them.  This DVD is nothing like that. Instead Jason gives 15 concrete, actionable ideas which are simple, effective & immediately implementable. These 15 simple tips save you little packets of time during your work day, which soon add up to hours and days over weeks you implement his advice.  As Jason says, if you only improve 1% then you would gain 3.5 days in a year, and believe me, you are going to improve your time management by well over 1% if you apply these tips.

I'd highly recommend anyone wanting to save time at work, get more organised and more effectively use the tools they have, to watch and then apply the ideas contained in this DVD.",1306454400,,1527,4.5787545787545785
