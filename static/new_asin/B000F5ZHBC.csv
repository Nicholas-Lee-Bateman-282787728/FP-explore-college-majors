8117819,3,B000F5ZHBC,"I can sum up ""Flesh for Olivia"" in three words:

Strange.
Boring.
Nudity.

If you've seen many Seduction Cinema releases, especially the early ones like this one (this is from 2002), you know pretty much what to expect: Weird themes and pacing, questionable acting, fairly low production values, Misty Mundae, A.J. Kahn and lot of really dull and unrealistic girl-on-girl sex scenes.

That describes this movie just as much as the others. What separates it a little bit is the extent of the nudity--which does go a little further in explicitness than some of the others, and is more committed to full frontal--and the fact that it actually has one boy-girl scene, a welcome surprise weak though it may be.

The plot itself is hard to follow and takes itself too seriously. But you're probably not going to view it for  that anyway.",1390521600,2,831,4.783216783216783
8117820,4,B000F5ZHBC,I received this dvd on time and in good condition.  I like this dvd except the the blood scene.  I am a fan of Misty Mundae.,1372982400,,124,3.730769230769231
8117821,5,B000F5ZHBC,"Many of Misty's roles present her as the victim rather than the villan. True, Misty fans do not like to see our beautiful Misty smacked around like a rag doll or killed off in the movie. Wm Hellfire (after many attempts) finally gets it right in this movie by having Misty play both roles: The victim, because she is  under the spell of a psychopathic maniac and as the villan because she has no qualms about providing the psychopath with the satisfaction of his desires.

The story is a simple one: Misty was a stripper turned prostitite who performs sexual acts on women to the psychopath's(Claudio)delight and he puts money into her checkbook monthly to keep her solvent monitarily. The greatest perversion of all is that Misty must strangle the women while Claudio films it.

The highlight of the film is the extreme sexuality of the women, particularly Misty, who plays the part of the wicked prostitute to a tee. I found this the most sensual movie that MM has made, and her pals Julian Wells and AJ Khan per-form their roles to perfection. This film came very close to being a porn film and they might have considered crossing the line when they made the film.

All of the Seduction Cinema's beauty's are present, adding spice to the movie. Interestingly, Misty herself ,playing a low-life charactor, wears little makeup so as to give us less than her usual facial beauty. Her body, however looks great,and is presented in a very sensual way. The dialogue matches the visual element very well,in fact,is out standing. Director Bill Hellfire, the master of the one room set,finally got it right.",1307750400,8,1601,4.768953068592058
8117822,3,B000F5ZHBC,"This movie is from Seduction Cinema / Factory 2000, is not AfterHours because is not as explicit as AfterHours titles are. This movie is a kind of sequel from Silk Stocking Strangler, this time featuring Misty Mundae as Olivia, a former striper in a search for a new place to live, of course with a dark and hidden agenda.

You have the usual Seduction Cinema girl-girl ""not too explicit"" pairing with the addition of Misty strangling Julian, AJ and filming the whole thing for his master, a freak portrayed by Dean Paul.

Beware, this movie is only 74 minutes long, not 120 as stated. The extras only include trailes from other Seduction Cinema and Shock-O-Rama production.

I think is nice for Misty's performance and the beautiful Julian Wells, but it could be better.",1247443200,18,771,4.7819548872180455
