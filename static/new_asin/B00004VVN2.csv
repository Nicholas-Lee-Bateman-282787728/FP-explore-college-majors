7924111,5,B00004VVN2,"It's really astonishing how an AMERICAN HERO has been ignored by the american movie makers. In England they have already issued Wonder Woman on DVD (I believe 3 episodes, so far).
I wish all of the episodes from the entire series would be available on DVD as soon as possible.
And perhaps a movie would be nice, possibly starring Linda Carter as Wonder Woman (she's still very pretty and young-looking); if not, she could, at least, succeed to her queen-mother's throne in the movie.
WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WONDER WOMAN ON DVD, just like we've had Spider Man, Charlie's Angels, The Hulk come-backs.",1063238400,3,596,4.740384615384615
7924112,5,B00004VVN2,"Some people have complained that Wonder Woman isn't available on DVD -- well, it is in the UK.  One volume (with 3 episodes) is available already, and a 2nd one is due to be released August 2003.  The one that's out now features the pilot for the CBS series (which takes place in 1977) as opposed to the original pilot, featuring Wonder Woman in WW2.  The 2nd episode is Anschluss '77, where an evil ex-Nazi scientist (are't all scientists evil??) brings back Adolf Hitler to life.  The 3rd episode is The Man Who Moved The World, about an ex-Japanese prisoner of war who has developed telekinetic powers, and tries to kill Wonder Woman (will he? won't he?!)  Re-live the fabulousness of the 70s, the clothes, the chest hair, and the wonderful, beautiful Lynda Carter.  It's all slightly camp, but all the better for it.  Buy it, and enjoy it (although the European PAL tv system may not work on American TVs)",1057795200,4,909,4.608695652173913
7924113,5,B00004VVN2,"I, too, grew up with Lynda, and have always loved this series.
But it's 2002, and one of the above reviewers is right - few people want to invest in VHS these days.  The ""Wonder Woman"" DVD series is long overdue.",1020729600,4,212,4.170731707317073
7924114,5,B00004VVN2,"C'mon you guys, let's get serious.  Where's the DVD release.  No one buys VHS stuff anymore.  While we're at it, what about the series on DVD.  Now there's a money making tip if I ever heard one.  After all, Wonder Woman started came before Black Scorpion, Xena, Supergirl etc.  Wonder Woman ROCKS",1015113600,6,297,4.615384615384615
7924115,4,B00004VVN2,"Let's face it, one look at Lynda Carter in the Wonder Woman suit is worth at least three stars.  Tall, statuesque, and athletic looking --- especially for the 1970's --- putting her in this role was truly inspired casting.
The 1940's portion of the series was markedly better than the ""modern"" ones, and wears a bit better.  Fighting Nazi supervillains was a better use of the character than the standard crime clichs of the later series.  The Seventies cars and architecture date the later series more than these.
Except for the business about the belt being her weakness, as opposed to being handcuffed by a man, the TV show was markedly consistent with the comic book series.  They didn't do enough with such things as the invisible plane, but it appears in these.  They also didn't seem to find that much time onscreen for Wonder Woman as opposed to Diana Prince.
Still, this was probably the best adaptation of one of the classic superheroes, at least until the first -Superman- movie appeared a few years later.  It deserves credit for that much.",1004313600,17,1052,4.752747252747253
7924116,1,B00004VVN2,"One of my dearest friends is a huge Wonder Woman fan, and last evening I was able to view most of this video... I can only describe the experience as nothing short of a root canal without  novicane.  Inane dialogue, unprofessional special effects, and simply a BAD script.
The comic book concept, wonderful... as a film, horrible!  While trying to be ""campy fun"" it fails tremendously.
Now for the HAS-BEENS that make up the cast... Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Fannie Flagg, Lyle Waggoner, Kenneth Mars, and poor Cloris Leachman.  One minute an Oscar/Emmy winner, the next well...  And beautiful Miss Carter. She really needed the contact lenses she pushes on late nite TV before she read this script!  But, it was tremendously sucessful for her career. Let's face it, it was her career. Heck, remember Tom Hanks on BOSOM BUDDIES?  The rest is history! (What drugs were those TV execs ON in the 70's ANYWAY!?!?!)
...  I would have given it ZERO stars...",982281600,,954,4.809815950920245
7924117,5,B00004VVN2,"The ABC 1&2 series of Wonder Woman was a delight to grow up with back in the 70's. Lyndia Carter, in the guise of Diana Prince & Wonder Woman, depicted the comic book character superbly with a balanced combination of serious acting in a comic book style. With tounge in cheek dialogue and colourful action sceenes, the series would still hold its own today, even though special effects technology has greatly advanced.  Both series would be a great addition to those who collect cult viewing, but more importantly, with the promise of a blockbuster movie of a 21st century Wonder Woman on the horizon, it would be prudent to re-release the originals, as they would surely be in demand by an even greater audience that I am sure already exsists today.",979344000,16,750,4.7251908396946565
7924118,5,B00004VVN2,"Hey! Before Xena, there was the Amazon Princess from Paradise Island. Lynda Carter was terrific start. Wonder Woman. Hopefully ""AMAZON""  will be able to deliver up some more, steadily, before Christmas. Battle  On! Whoops. Better hop in an invisible plane and find a red,white,blue  swimsuit. *G*",967766400,10,296,5.391304347826087
7924119,5,B00004VVN2,"As soon as Amazon gets this video in, I'm ordering. I grew up watching wonder woman, and am deeply offended that today's little girls do not have that opportunity. This should be required syndication on a national level!
Yes, Lynda Carter was a beauty queen, but she was not airheaded or  anorexic. Heck, she was an amazon who could and did save the day while  getting the hot guy. Thankfully Wonder Woman's version of ""girl  power"" would be way more Xena/Buffy than Spice Girls. Wonder Woman can  hold her own in any sittuation.
Excluding the horrid Cathy Lee Crosby  movie, the series was very well done for the time and still holds up.  Wonder Woman is one of the greatest shows of all times, and needs to be  offered as soon as possible.",964915200,18,741,4.526315789473684
7924120,5,B00004VVN2,"Back in the 70s, Warner Bros. decided to bring the DC Comics super heroine Wonder Woman to the small screen in the hopes of establishing a competative show with the Universal television series the Bionic Woman. The first  attempt failed miseribly. A Wonder Woman television movie starring Cathy  Lee Crosby aired without any of the trademark airs of the comic. Not only  was she blonde, wore a jump suit and didn't deflect bullets; but her other  super human abilites didn't exist either. Other than being an Amazon  Princess from Paradise Island, Wonder Woman was basically an athletic  Charlie's Angel. Seeing the folly of their mistakes, Warner Bros.  relaunched the series staring Miss World USA: Lynda Carter. Not only did  Lynda come through with all the missing airs of the character, but she  captured the essence of what it ment to be an icon. In this, the Pilot of  the relaunched 'New Adventures of Wonder Woman', Princess Diana discovers a  downed pilot (Steve Trevor) on the shores of her island home. When a  contest is held to see which Amazon will be worthy enough to escort the  stranger to America, Diana enters and wins the honor of becoming Wonder  Woman. Words can't express how much I enjoyed this episode. It's filled  with lots of action, humor and heart as only the eternally beautiful Lynda  Carter can capture. I strongly urge you to make this tape a part of your  collection as well.",963187200,19,1411,4.788381742738589
