4343922,4,B004EPZ070,"I went and seen this movie on mothers day... I had recently finished reading the book that the movie is based on (FYI I loved the book it was amazing)
I am always worried about reading a book then seeing how its adapted into a film how much it will be changed and if it will loose its charm... this movie has lots of change and they went in mannny different darections then the book but to my saprize it worked it was cute and charming and you heart realy akes for these caractors and you don't realy no what darection to feel or who to rout for... I loved the acting i think they casted realy well expeshaly Ginnifer Goodwin as Rachel she was vulnrable and loveable and the perfect pic... but my most fav part of the whole movie was without a doubt was John Krasinski as Ethan who in the book has a much smaller role but they gave him a larger role in the movie and that was definantly the best move they could have made he was perfect you cant help but fall in love with his caractor he just dose it so perfectly.
now the only reasons im gunna give this a 4 insetead of a 5 is because of 3 reasons... some things felt realy rushed to me I think they should have taked a little more time to give us a larger view of the whole thing (but this is said as a reader of the book so I no the story in detail so my view is different from someone who hasent) and second I think that Steve Howey was fantastic but the darection they took his caractor was a bit disapointing but Steve still did a fantastic job with it! and the 3rd reason is the ending a good ending i just wish it was exactly like the book ending but its a little diferent.... but all an all a great chick flick it reaches a topic that not manny others have done and i like that!!! i hope they make something blue!",1304899200,5,1773,4.025495750708215
4343923,5,B004EPZ070,"I loved the movie and saw it twice in the first weekend.  Ginnfer and Colin did a great job.  Colin reminds me of a young Tom Cruise  but better.  He seems soulful, manages to play the character with integrity and gives great glances!  A must see.",1304812800,59,247,4.282608695652174
4343924,2,B004EPZ070,"OK, so it was ""Girls Night Out"" and we decided to catch this flick.  I am not a Kate Hudson fan but do like some of the other actors.  I was very disappointed in the film. Some scenes were quite funny but they were starring the actors I do like (John Krasinski and Steve Howey)...the rest of the movie was just lame...I was so frustrated with the ending I wanted to SCREAM. My girls didn't care for it either..one even got up and left after about an hour of enduring lame acting.  I think somewhere I read it was rated a ""D""...I concur.  Maybe I just need to stick with reading books for entertainment.  Thanks Hollywood.",1304726400,6,621,4.318965517241379
4343925,1,B004EPZ070,"Movies like Something Borrowed are the reason romantic comedies have earned such a bad reputation. Bad writing, lame characters, clichd plot, Kate Hudson: all the ingredients are there, and the result is predictable and dull. How I miss real romantic comedies, like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" I wonder what happened to them and why they've been replaced with this tripe that's neither romantic nor funny.",1304640000,13,429,5.231884057971015
4343926,1,B004EPZ070,"Caught a sneak peak, I should have snuck out.  Oh, how awful.  Kate Hudson is worse than awful.  Why does this woman keep getting hired.  I mean, if she volunteered to star in movies they should turn her down.  Poor thing has convinced herself that she's something special yet her wretched personality comes shining through in her acting and ultimately sinks the flick.  If she were a middle class broad, she'd be deemed a needy horrific mess of a person that most people would politely try to avoid. Hollywood, however, keeps feeding the machine and she feels like she has something to offer the world.  NOT NOT NOT.  Please retire and make room for better actors.  Go schlep the make up you make mega a bucks to support that doesn't even make you look all that.  Awful flick.",1304035200,15,777,4.565217391304348

Of course Late Hudson is great too.  Now the hunk Dex , Colin Egglesfield, well let me just say I can watch him ALL DAY LONG.  John Krasinski  is a great actor.  I have liked him in every movie I've seen him perform.  I wish fervently for this movie and Luke Greenfield truly gives us another chance to see these four great actors in part 2 of Something Borrowed !!!  PLEASE",1526256000,,545,4.104761904761904

4344160,5,B004EPZ070,I love this movie. The theme of the movie sounds so messed up but this movie really is a gem. All the main actors did such a great job. The setting of the movie was fantastic. There are times during the movie where you literally want to go the Hamptons and hang out at your beach house. ( If I could ever afford one...lol) I own this movie and watch it every couple of months. All the fans are waiting for sequel and it's taking forever.  5 stars!,1525392000,,447,4.079545454545454
4344161,2,B004EPZ070,"Why do so many romcoms think it's a great gag for a straight character to pretend to be gay or to get offended because someone thought they were gay? Not only was this movie painfully white and heterosexual but the plot was really weak. I know it's a romcom, which isn't expected to be deep or complicated, but when all their problems could be solved in 10 minutes if they actually had a proper conversation, I can't focus on John Krasinski's character, who was the only one with any personality.",1524960000,,496,4.522222222222222

4344285,5,B004EPZ070,"I bought this film because of Colin Egglesfield, whom I love watching for not only his talent but his smile.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film and the music, and happy to find another talented and beautiful actress in Ginnifer Goodwin. Hopefully we will see her in more romantic films.",1522368000,,299,4.537037037037037
4344286,5,B004EPZ070,"Absolutely loved this movie!  I'd been avoiding watching it because I don't typically like rom-coms, but I like Ginnifer Goodwin.  Now I love Colin Egglesfield.  They played Rachel and Dex to perfection!  I thought all the actors were terrific!  I'm reading reviewers that believe Rachel should have gone for her friend Ethan.  I don't think so.  Although he was sweet and often the voice of reason and he obviously cared about her, a feeling of a great friendship is all I got from him.  He seemed to bully Rachel to go after what she wanted.  When Rachel accused him of not pursuing his own dreams,  the best he could come back with was he was moving to London because he had a book deal.  Okay.  The point is I really liked the story.  Didn't approve of the cheating, but if you follow the story you actually begin to understand it and accept the reasons behind it.  In law school Rachel was so shy and insecure she wouldn't stand up for herself.  Dex wasn't sure she was interested in a relationship with him so he asked her to dinner.  With her best friend Darcy crashing their ""dinner date"" and coming on so strong, Dex thought Rachel was actually trying to set him up with her.  Years passed, Dex safely engaged to Darcy, add being a little drunk ... Rachel loosens up enough to tell Dex how she really felt about him in law school.  All the pent up passion Dex had for Rachel came to the surface.  I know you can have feelings for a person and just because you may believe that person doesn't return those feelings, doesn't mean your feelings just go away.  Even with time passing and other relationships.  That's the truth I saw in this movie that I can personally relate to and I enjoyed it.  I'd like to think I'd move away before doing what Rachel did; but then again, I came away believing Rachel and Dex did what they did because they had a truly once-in-a-lifetime kind of love.  I'd like to think that. That's the good thing about movies ... you can make your own assumptions.",1521676800,,1992,4.441988950276243

4344446,1,B004EPZ070,The whole premise of the movie is a girl having an affair with her best friends fiance. Were supposed to be sympathetic because shes not hot? Um...no. Nothing about this was okay.,1515283200,,179,4.625
4344447,4,B004EPZ070,"(Minor Spoilers) At the outset, when you realize there may be some indiscretion and backstabbing going on between best friends as the premise, you may be inclined to skip this one.  Resist that inclination, as I also fought to like this film, probably for that reason (as well as it seeming just like another rom-com).  But, discrete from the book (which I admittedly have not read), this film will likely incrementally pull you in.  ""Rachel"" (Giniffer Goodwin) and """"Darcy"" (Kate Hudson) are the aforementioned best friends, and ""Dex"" (Colin Egglesfield) is the man who may break their seemingly unbreakable bond.  Even the soundtrack and supporting cast (John Krasinki of TV's ""The Office,"" as ""Ethan"" here, and Steve Howey of TV's ""Reba,"" as ""Marcus"" here) fulfill expectations, and the ending may surprise you, though the door is actually left ajar for a sequel (since the novel apparently has a sequel).  All in all, it's a well-produced and quite satisfying film, thanks to a very capable and good-looking cast and conscientious script.  (Then again, it may be a tad awkward to watch this with your best friend if your spouses are also in the room, and maybe I liked it more just because I'm single and saw it alone, LOL).",1514592000,2,1228,4.8798076923076925

are reviewing the purchase instead of the movie itself. It was beautifully filmed with amazing and talented actors with
borrowing a love that should that was hidden between two people. I couldn't get enough of Dex and Rachel's scenes.

4344597,3,B004EPZ070,Predictable plot that dragged on for twice as long as it should've been. The only two bright spots in the movie were John Krasinski and Ginnifer Goodwin.

4344598,3,B004EPZ070,I enjoyed this movie until I finished watching it and realized that the morale of this story is that a guy is more important than your best friend.

4345219,1,B004EPZ070,"Aside from a few good quips by the always lovable John Krasinski, this flick is cringe-inducing from beginning to end. The storyline is painfully predictable (even for a rom-com), and the acting is surprisingly inadequate -- especially considering such a talented lineup of actors. In any given scene, it is either too much or too little. In the case of Kate Hudson's performance, every line and gesture feels overplayed and overcooked, which is unusual because Hudson is usually a master of both serious and silly. Ginnifer Goodwin plays exactly the character you think she does -- hopelessly sweet and spineless to a fault. And the lead actor, Colin Egglesfield, is remarkable mainly for bearing such an uncanny resemblance to Tom Cruise. The romance shared by the two protagonists is so convincingly dispassionate that rooting for them becomes a forced schlep. It's one of those film concepts that, in theory, had the potential to be the type of easily consumable chick flick that indulges a certain need for predictability and simplicity, but in execution, ""Something Borrowed"" is the two hours of your life you can't get back.",1485648000,,1131,5.086021505376344

However, I think the movie would have better told the story if the sex scenes were steamier, as they were in the book.  Second, Gennifer Goodwin lacked the essence of Rachel.  I know Rachel is supposed to be the less attractive and insecure of the two (Darcy).  But in this movie, she was very flat.  You didn't see her guilt, giddiness or emotional struggle.  It almost seemed out of character when, in the end, she told Darcy that she missed her.  Kate Hudson was a good choice for Darcy, but I think another equally well-known actress would  have been a better choice for Rachel.",1476144000,,743,4.357664233576642

It  was so awful and lame that I can hardly put it into words. The three lead characters are so insipid,  boring and have no personality whatsoever.  Tack that onto being cheaters and liars and how in the world am I supposed to connect with any of them. To top it off the one character who you actually come to care for and like is left sad and alone in the end of the movie.  What an absolute waste of time.

I watched it because I love all of the actors, but the three main characters were shallow, air-headed, and annoying, and the plot was lazy and poorly written. It doesn't bother me that there wasn't much substance (that's not why I watch chick flicks lol), but it was not even entertaining or satisfying in any way. The only character I had any sympathy for was Ethan, but there wasn't even the satisfaction of a happy ending for him. But why was he interested in Rachel, anyways? And why was Rachel interested in Dex!? The good guy gets snubbed for a two-timing, stuck-up, cardboard cut-out of a man, but in the end, Rachel and Dex deserve each other, because they're both horrible, obnoxious people.",1461542400,,760,4.637037037037037

But after one drink too many at her 30th birthday party, perpetual good girl Rachel unexpectedly ends up in bed with the guy she's had a crush on since law school, Dex, who just happens to be Darcy's fianc. When Rachel and Darcy's lifelong friendship collides with true love, it leads to unexpected complications and potentially explosive romantic revelations. Meanwhile, Ethan, who has been Rachel's constant confidante and sometimes conscience, has been harboring a secret of his own, and Marcus, an irrepressible womanizer, can't keep his mind out of the gutter or his hands off any girl within reach.",1460678400,,806,5.022388059701493

The only redeeming person in the whole movie was Ethan (Jon Krasinski), and ::SPOILER:: he didn't get a happy ending...

The case was pretty banged up and it seemed like someone poked it all over with a pen/pencil through the wrapper. The DVD disc seemed new though, but if this was purchased for someone else it would be a problem. I ordered another movie in the same package and it was fine, so it wasn't a shipping issue. Seems like a quality control issue.

The actual movie was really good though. It followed pretty closely, as movies are always a little different and significantly less deep than their books. *Spoiler* The most noticeable difference is probably Ethan's(Krasinski's) role. He's more prominent in the movie and it was my favorite part of the movie. What really annoyed me is that they wrote the movie so he liked Rachel, which sucks cause we all knew who she would end up with. So we fall in love with Ethan, only to see him be hurt. I hated what they did because in the book, I'm pretty sure they were just really good friends, which was perfect. Anyway, besides that this was a really good movie.

4350193,4,B004EPZ070,"Very good movie because of Gennifer Goodwin's performance, as well as Kate Hudson, who plays a girl who has always gotten by with her looks and never had to sweat anything in life.  Hudson plays the perfect shallow personality.  It seems that she has no clue how shallow she really is!  Gennifer Goodwin's character endures watching her best friend become engaged to a guy she met in law school, as well as the guy of her dreams.  This agony escalates throughout the moving, nearly all the way to the altar!  If I were to criticize any one point, it's how long in the script that Gennifer's character has to endure her suffering.  It's just too long a time.  The man in question is absolutely gorgeous, but basically an airhead when it comes to making a sound decision of whom he wants to spend the rest of his life with.  John Krasinski plays the voice-of-reason, and the long-suffering friend; and it's too bad he is nothing more than a co-star, because Krasinski has the looks and charisma to be a main character.",1431043200,,1016,4.574585635359116

As a professional writer though, I have trouble with a story line in which I don't respect or particularly like anyone. It's a story about a group of people who are either morally bankrupt, gutless, selfish, or - in the case of Dex and Rachel, all three.  I didn't know who to slap. Two hours of the lead characters going back and forth, back and forth, where they just almost do something morally decisive and remotely intelligent, to chickening out, was too much.

The story of ironically introverted lawyer Rachel inadvertently eases back into an old friendship with her law school pal Dex that quickly escalates into a full-blown affair, unbeknownst to her best childhood friend and Dex's fiance Darcy. I had read the book prior to seeing this movie and was very impressed on the casting. Each character--particularly Rachel and Darcy, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson respectively, fit my mental character sketch to a T according to the book. I also enjoyed the movie's depiction of New York life, including Hamptons frolics, through the lense of successful young professionals. It was a glimpse of the good life. But above all, this story touches upon the importance of integrity, honesty and boldness in relationships, including how short-term consequences of brutal honesty can lead to long-term happiness.",1422662400,,896,5.361702127659575

4350854,5,B004EPZ070,"I had wanted to see this movie when I saw the coming attractions for it. It seemed like a good chick flick that would give me a couple of chuckles and maybe a teary eye. I was expecting it to be just okay, nothing more, nothing less.

I never did watch it in the theater but instead watched it at home when it came on HBO. I had my TiVo record it and watched it when I got a chance. Well let me say that I wished I had watched it earlier! I loved the movie from beginning to end, I loved and still do love, every part of the movie. I downright refuse to delete this movie from my TiVo despite having the DVD and having it on my iPad. I have probably watched the movie a dozen times since the first time I watched it and I love it every single time.

I am not a fan of watching a movie that revolves around cheating at all. I don't believe in that and think that one should break up with the significant other if they have doubts but yet in the movie I found myself just understanding what was going on. I fell in love with Rachel and Dex and their deeply buried love for one another. While some may say the ending was predictable I felt that it could have went a completely different way. We've seen it in other love stories.

Overall I recommend this all of my friends and strangers. It's a great movie with comedy, romance, wit, disappointment and more. Rent it, TiVo it, download it, pop it in the DVD player and just watch it!",1419897600,2,1430,4.0638297872340425

4351619,5,B004EPZ070,"I LOVE this movie, and have watched it at least 30 times.  I never get tired of it.  I love the music in it, too.  This movie has a lot of depth to it.  Something ""borrowed"" is what the BRIDE wears at her wedding, and is to be RETURNED.  So, Darcy shamelessly snatched Dex away from shy Rachel, too insecure to speak up for herself.  The TRUE LOVE in this movie is between Dex and Rachel, and was there all the time.  It came out when Rachel revealed to Dex her secret crush on him in law school.  Did you see the anger in Dex in the taxi when he realized what he had missed out on?  Both their passion in the taxi was 6 years' worth of pent-up love and desire.  I don't pass judgment on what they did together.  I didn't find Darcy a sympathetic character at all.  She was shallow and self-centered.  She had an affair with Marcus and got pregnant, while still engaged to Dex.  Why should Rachel want to give up the deep closeness she and Dex had in exchange for Ethan: ""Gee, I like you.  It's not love, but it kinda feels like love.  I guess I miss you.  You're like 'home' to me.""  They grew up together since childhood.  They were close friends and that's all they'd ever be.  That would not be a marriage of two souls.  The love between Dex and Rachel has survived 6 years of separation.  THAT'S what love is.

Dex was under the domineering thumb of his dad all his life, no wonder it was impossible for him to stand up to him.  He wanted to be a teacher, but his dad said ""No, you're going to be a lawyer.""  His mother suffered from chronic depression because her husband was so domineering and unloving (he skipped out on her when she needed him the most).  And Darcy telling Dex's dad she'll have as many children as he wants her to have was disgusting!  She's stealing Dex's manhood.  Dex is not even being allowed to decide how many children HE wants to have.

Finally, Rachel gets the strength (thanks to Ethan) to stand up to Dex and tell him to cancel the wedding, and that gives Dex the backbone to do the same to his father.  He doesn't want to marry Darcy, but his Dad tries to force him into it because [breaking up with Darcy]  ""that's not the kind of people we are.""  It's all about narcissistic image, he doesn't care about his son or love him or his poor mousy wife.

How appropriate that in the end, pregnant, unmarried and no future, Darcy is chasing Ethan down a street in London -- the man she thought so little of and called him a ""s---head"".  She needed a husband, and she blew it.  She gave up a 2 million dollar house for Marcus with no job, smoking pot, rescuing chipmunks, and riding a skateboard!  That's all the future Darcy had.  She got what she deserved.",1411689600,6,2690,4.234714003944773

4351675,2,B004EPZ070,"THERE WILL BE SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
Alright Rachel, let's have a chat, shall we?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ETHAN?! He was perfect! The nicest guy who was always there to show you when you were right and when you were doing something stupid! So why on earth would you go for the guy who was originally going to marry your so called 'best friend'? I don't know if you know this but she was kind of a female dog. Witch with a capital B. Lady of the night. Not a nice friend. Very self centered and if you are into that as a best friend then fine! But honestly, she took the guy you were CLEARLY into! I bet my bottom dollar that she knew too! She even tells him to ask you out! Which he didn't cause he is dumb! And she took him from you! And he let her! I say dump both of their sorry booties and drive off with Mr. Good-Lookin' into the sunset. (I mean Ethan if you cannot tell)
Alright, I'll break it down for you:
Ethan: Was always there for you! ALWAYS!! HE EVEN CONFESSED THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU! GIRL YOU HAD IT MADE!!!
Other Dude: (Dex. If you want to call him by his name) Was as blind as a bat, refused to let you know how he felt AND after you slept with him he still went all over YOUR BEST FRIEND! That is not cool.
So don't cheat with the cheater! He turned YOU into a cheater. Do you want that on your permanent record? NO! Just cause his eyes are beautifully brown and he has a charming personality--STOP RIGHT THERE! It's a trap! Eventually his eyes will droop and he will get crabby and mean once he becomes old! So stick with Ethan! He will look beautiful once he gets old and won't get crabby! I just know, okay?
Alright I'm done.
...Basically I found the movie stupid.",1411084800,4,1700,4.0625
4351676,2,B004EPZ070,"I got absorbed in this film, even though I knew it was your usual ""he's marrying the wrong girl instead of our heroine"" chick flick, probably because the acting is good from Kate Hudson and Ginnifer Godwin and others. However, I lost patience with the main characters very quickly and their inability to act on their own behalf. I know that was the movie's point, but still -- I just didn't *like* them. The movie's fatal flaw was that its so-called hero was not written nearly as sympathetically as the ""faithful friend"" (Jon Krakowski). That made the whole premise -- that this guy was worth all the strife that the main characters go through -- not work for me, and something fell flat in the end.",1411084800,,700,4.563492063492063
4351677,3,B004EPZ070,"Something Borrowed is unfortunately a movie on borrowed time. In this movie there are friendships that are tested when secrets come out when Rachel falls for Dex which is her best friends fiance.  It's directed by Luke Greenfield who before this directed movies such as The Animal and The Girl Next Door.  This is based of the book written by Emily Giffin while the screenplay for the movie was written by Jennie Snyder.

Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a lawyer and when she was in law school she fell for one of her fellow classmates, Dex (Colin Egglesfield), who comes from an affluent family, but during their time at school she was too shy to do anything about it. When Dex meets her best friend Darcy (Kate Hudson), who sometimes treats her horribly, with the permission of Rachel, Darcy makes a move on Dex and gets him. Eventually, they get engaged and Darcy asks Rachel to be her Maid of Honor.  Darcy throws her a birthday party and Dex is there, unfortunately she still has feelings towards him but can't say anything to him about it. When they finally get a moment alone after the birthday party she tells him that she had a thing for him in college which surprised him, then after drinking a little bit too much they spend the night together. Not knowing what to do after what happened they do their best to try and just forget what happend. Ethan (John Krasinski), Rachel's close friend, tells her that she needs to get off her but and make a decision because if she doesn't she will spend the rest of her life regretting the decision she never made.

There were parts of this movie that I really enjoyed but at the same time there were parts of this movie that I could really live without.  The scene above is one scene that was my favorite however, I feel that the chemistry between John and Ginnifer was just great.  There arguments were filled with so much passion it made you want them to get together but during the whole movie she just didn't seem like she wanted him.

On the other hand the chemistry between Colin and Ginnifer was lacking immensely and it made the movie drag along for me.  The whole time they were together I just keep thinking why the heck they don't work well together!  I thought that Colin and Kate had much better chemistry so when those to were paired together the movie wasn't all that bad.

As far as what I would give this movie, its not one of my favorites...  C-.  This is a movie made from a two series book and the second book never made it to film causing the whole story not being able to be told which left this incomplete for me and just not one of my favorite movies.  If you want to know how it ends then I suggest you check it out.

4351749,3,B004EPZ070,"""Spoiler Alert"" The best part of the movie by far was the performance by John Krasinski he nailed every scene. In particular one of the scences I think sums up the whole movie his character Ethan is trying to get the main character Rachel to tell her best friend what has been going on and she won't do it. He yells I am the only one here that really cares about you. And that in a nut shell is what the whole movie is about. Rachel is in a relationship with a best friend who doesnt really love her and thats the real story line. The part about falling in love with a college friend 6 years previous who becomes engaged to her best friend and they have an affair was insulting and immoral and ridiculous and the fact that it was justified just speaks to the kind of world we live in. at a the closing scene Rachel runs into the Kate Hudson character and outright says she is not sorry for sleeping with her fianc just sorry that she hurt her. That was sooo insulting and was designed for the audience to be proud of Rachel really, really sad. How many of us would appreciate our best friend sleeping with our fiance and not being sorry for it. Yes Kate Hudson should not have been with the guy in the first place but that was his fault and Rachels fault as much as it was hers. Rachel let her walk all over her all those years and yes she needed to stop doing that, have a conversation with Kate about how she made her feel try to heal the relationship if that was possible or move on. The answer certainly was not to have a relationship with her fiance behind her back. She could have told the guy how she felt let him make a decision with jumping in bed with him again just how life is and what people accept as normal. Decency is out the window. I mean yes go for what you want but that does not have to be at everyone else's expense nor throwing decency out of the window. There was a better way to tell this story and I am pretty disgusted at that part of it. The reason i said it was ok is primarily because of the friendship scenes with Ethan and Rachel - he was great and would give him 5 starts.",1410134400,,2105,4.099273607748184

4352490,2,B004EPZ070,"If you like movies where pretty people make terrible life decisions for no apparent reason, all in a totally generic and mediocre rom-com setting, then boy-howdy, will you LOVE this movie.

Me? No, I didn't love it. This flick was a waste of my time. It reminded me a little of the Meryl Streep movie IT'S COMPLICATED. It had all of the cheating of COMPLICATED, but none of that movie's wit, or sympathetic characters. Not that the filmmakers don't attempt to create some (heavy-handed) sympathy for these one-dimensional people. But alas, NO ONE is likable. By the end of the movie, when everything inevitably works out well for all (well, almost all) involved, I just didn't care. In fact, the ending was so forced, so sappy, so pat...frankly, I was angry.

We've all come to expect nothing but duds from Kate Hudson. Oh Kate...remember ALMOST FAMOUS? That was a great movie. This one? Not so much.

Jim from The Office is TOTALLY WASTED in this movie (and I'm sure he looks back on this movie and WISHES he was wasted). His character exists only to nag and yell at Ginnifer (hey lady, you spelled 'Jennifer' wrong) Goodwin.

And the guy playing 'the love interest' Dex? Yawn. I mean, he's pretty and all, but I don't see why these gals would fall for him. The filmmakers should have just called the character Dexter, and then hired Michael C. Hall for the roll. Then Dexter could have wrapped all the characters up in Saran Wrap, tied them to a table, and murdered the hell out of them. VOILA! Season 9 of Showtime's beloved DEXTER. Hey, it totally could have worked...

So why give SOMETHING BORROWED 2 stars instead of 1? Because it had a couple of semi-entertaining moments, plus I liked some of the minor characters (stalker one-night stand girl, doofus womanizing man-child skater, and...and no one else, really).  Otherwise, just watch a Hallmark movie (or better yet, a Lifetime movie). At least those movies don't try to be anything other than what they are: Entertaining Crap. SOMETHING BORROWED is simply crap that forgets to entertain.",1403740800,,2049,4.7740112994350286

4352492,1,B004EPZ070,"**This review contains spoilers**

When I watch a movie, I want someone to root for.  Since the main characters are cheaters and the sidekick a hypocrite, I couldnt.

First there's Rachel, Darcy's supposed friend.  While drunk, she cheats with Darcy's fianc Dex and instead of ending the affair, she ""sees what this is first"".  At the end, she says she doesn't regret the affair, only that Darcy got hurt...as if those were separate events, but they weren't. And by agreeing to ""see what this is first"", she was agreeing for Dex to treat Darcy like an object to be placed on a shelf...while he played with Rachel to see if she was better.  So she was actually feeling competitive towards Darcy, not caring if she got hurt.

Next is Dex.  Not only is he a coward for cheating, but he's a coward for only dating Darcy because he thought Rachel wanted him to.  He has no mind of his own - not with Rachel, Darcy, or his parents.  He's also a hypocrite for acting disgusted when Darcy flakes on Rachel when meanwhile, he's cheating on her, which is even flakier.

Lastly, there's Ethan.  Like Dex, he's a hypocrite for acting disgusted that Dex runs away from his problems when meanwhile, he hides from a woman who's attracted to him and even lies about being gay.  So he's a hypocrite and a liar.

He's contradictory, too.  When he discovers Rachel's affair, he says he's impressed but quickly adds that good people do bad things. So he admits she did a bad thing...and he's impressed by that?  He rationalizes her cheating saying no one is married yet, so like Rachel, he doesn't respect the boundaries of exclusive relationships.

So again, no one to root for. Not even Darcy, who's a loudmouthed narcissist.  There's no victims here either. Rachel and Dex act like Darcy's their oppressor keeping them caged, but it's really their own passivity doing that. Therefore, their cheating isn't heroic even though Darcy cheated, too. Two wrongs don't make a right.",1403568000,,1958,4.708823529411765

4353112,2,B004EPZ070,"Since everyone has their own opinions, I figured I would share mine. I gave this 2 stars because honestly, I didn't really like it. I was not impressed. The acting is great! The cast has awesome chemistry and John Krasinski is a scream as always. What I didn't like is the story. I will say I have not read the book this is based on so I can't comment on whether or not it follows the actual story or not but I found this movie actually kinda depressing.

The gist is this: Girl has crush on guy. Guy is engaged to girl's best friend. Guy and girl fall in love and cheat on best friend. Best friend is also cheating on guy. Guy 2 loves girl but doesn't tell her until the end. Then finally it all comes out and everyone lives happily ever after.

Really? I'm sorry, but that when I watch a romance or a romcom I want it to end up with the characters getting what or who they deserved. In reality, Dex should've ended up with Claire since he didn't deserve any of the female characters in this role. I liked the twist with Marcus and Darcy...that was kinda cute. Rachel and Ethan should've ended up together, though. Like I said, everyone has their own take on movies...that's mine.

The only other thing I thought was interesting and this is totally irrelevant to the movie here but I did find it funny that Kate Hudson's character wound up being with the same guy that she was with when she played a different character in Bride Wars. Now that was a funny movie! lol. Go see that instead.",1395619200,,1489,4.291814946619217

4354879,5,B004EPZ070,"I truly love this movie starring my girl Kate Hudson and Jenifer.  I would never do this to my bff, but hey it's 2013 almost fourteen who knows what most people are down with.  He should have told Kate's character that he didn't really love her and it would have been all good, but to cheat with a friend is cold! At any rate it's just a movie but based on fact. If you have friends like this I would suggest you get yourself some better friends seriously.  I believe this is the part one to bride wars because the same guy who played Marcus is the same guy who played Daniel and it the same script/punchline.",1387843200,,609,4.188034188034188

8427453,2,B004EPZ070,"Look, I'll admit, the movie kept me hooked till the very end because I was desperate to know what happened, but in the end, I was sorely disappointed. I enjoyed the parts about Rachel learning to stand up for herself and what she wanted a little more, and John Krasinki as Ethan was fantastic and easily the best character, but other than that, the appeal ended for me.
Cheating with your best friend's fiance is not okay, and I don't like that the movie portrays it as just another silly romcom trope that will eventually lead to a happy ever after. I also don't like that Rachel feels horrible about it up until Darcy also admits to cheating. Just because Darcy is also cheating, does not suddenly make everything okay. Cheating with your best friend's fiance is not okay, even if your best friend isn't a nice person. Even if your best friend is also cheating. I also don't like that Rachel gives up relationships with other people she cares about simply because she is ""so in love"" with Dex. After how horribly he treats her, I was expecting her to give him a solid middle finger goodbye and go find happiness somewhere else with someone better, but it never happened. She just keeps pining for him until eventually everything ""works out,"" although I'm using that phrase very loosely.",1527465600,,1288,4.62882096069869
