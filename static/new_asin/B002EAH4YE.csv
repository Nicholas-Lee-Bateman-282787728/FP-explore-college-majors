8367025,5,B002EAH4YE,"Esteban has been both criticized and acclaimed for his courses and his unfortunate dive into a guitar and DVD course set.
With mixed reviews on the guitar itself, this review is about the steel string course.
First, his voice alone is worth the price of admission, the deep timbre puts you at ease while he tirelessly explains how to hold your guitar and and hands, ""just so""
His teaching style gets you playing immediately in the first dvd, a few basic chords, a very nice melody to play both fingerstyle and ""flat pick"" as he so eloquently puts it.
In a bonus on each DVD of a music video, Esteban shows his talent, he's indeed a master of guitar.
while the style of music may not be what most people want to play nowadays, it's a great foundation for learning to play.
Later Dvd's work on expanding the basic knowledge from the previous lesson, until you find yourself playing a full song and feeling the satisfaction of actually playing instead of just ""noodling around"" with the beginnings of a dozen songs and a chord or two.
Personally, I enjoy rock and heavy metal, but I found this course to be immensely helpful and enjoyable.
The practice routines alone have taken my basic skills to another level.
A great course by a genuinely likable man. Well with the time and effort.",1457654400,2,1283,4.582608695652174
