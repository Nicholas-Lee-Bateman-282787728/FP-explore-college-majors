7295339,1,B00ZVAD1VE,Terrible. The locale and pretty much everything is flat out wrong. They have turned the Texas Gulf Coast swamp region in mountains and desert. The storyline is mostly fabrication and this story is unrecognizable as then events it claims to portray.,1507248000,,248,5.073170731707317
7295340,5,B00ZVAD1VE,"I have gotten into a bit of a habit. On the Fourth Of July, after watching the fireworks, I go home, and binge watch Sons Of Liberty.  The fireworks celebrate our country's origin, and this saga shows why it was so damned important!
  We need this. Hell, we ARE this.  Be proud of these people.  Be proud of what they accomplished.  But mostly be proud of the country they gave us.

  Sure, there are some parts which aren't exactly historically correct, but the major facts are there.  After the first time I watched this, i just had to look up Dr. Warren.  I was amazed to learn how important this man I had never heard of was to the revolution!  Not only to us, but to the British as well.  Yes, they really did mutilate his body, but that wasn't enough for them.  A few days later a bunch of redcoats went back, dug him up, and mutilated him some more!  That's how much they hated him and what he did to get this country started, but I never read anything about him in any of my history books in school!  I'm just glad for Google! You should look up some of the people you don't know much about from this show.  It'll amaze you.
  I am a patriot.  I am a disabled veteran.  I love my country.  This show meant the world to me.  Please watch it.",1499212800,2,1248,4.151260504201681

8720950,2,B00ZVAD1VE,"Not a very accurate telling of the events leading up to the Revolution and thereafter. It has more theatrical elements than historical truths. The Militia at Lexington and Concord used rifles, not muskets. The colonials were making an average of 500 yard shots against the British army, sniping the British all the way back to Boston. A musket is a smooth bore weapon usually of large caliber, which is mostly what this series showed the settlers having. What they actually had were rifles, a long barrel with riflings cut in it to make the ball spin and more accurate and go a greater distance. The musket was on average a .75 caliber weapon and was only effective up to around 50 yards. You just pointed it in the general direction because it was not at all accurate. The regular Colonial army used the smooth bore 'Bess' muskets, not the Militia. At least half or more of colonials were already armed with smaller caliber rifles they used for hunting and protection against the Indians.",1527465600,,989,4.722543352601156
8720951,1,B00ZVAD1VE,"It would be palatable if it was well done in spite of the pure fictionalization of the Revolution. However, it is not well done. A root canal is more entertaining..",1520812800,,164,4.5
8720952,1,B00ZVAD1VE,"Completely inaccurate,  from the beginning of the first episode with Sam Adams escaping the British soldiers by using his parkour skills-- wtaf. I could not get through episode 1, but scanned a few more episides before reviewing. So dissapointing. Watch HBO's JOHN ADAMS or AMC's TURN for not only good drama built on accuracy , but for excitement as well. This is utter bilge. Don't support it. Wish there were a no star rating.",1520380800,,429,4.797297297297297
8720953,3,B00ZVAD1VE,"This was an alright miniseries, but nothing great.  It's not one I would watch again, but it was fine for a one time thing.  I did expect it to be a little more exciting (along the lines of ""Turn: George Washington's Spies"", which is fantastic).  Most of the actors I wasn't too familiar with, except for Dean Norris from Breaking Bad.  I loved him as Ben Franklin :)",1517356800,,367,4.352941176470588
8720954,4,B00ZVAD1VE,"Historically, this is utter nonsense. There's a point where artistic license becomes fiction. That said, this is a really compelling story, well-directed, well-cast, well-acted. Very enjoyable to watch.

As a history channel offering, this is a disgrace. It does a disservice to our true heritage. It took real people, with real human limitations and frailties, taking on extraordinary risks and sacrifices, against a smart, well-trained, tactically and numerically superior enemy, to bring about the success of the American Revolution.

Paul Revere was not a superhero assassin with mad hand-to-hand combat skills and a magical throwing axe. Sam Adams was not a parkour ninja. The English were not a bunch of idiots. Thomas Gage was not a sadistic cartoon villain.

The show makes the Revolution seem easy with bumbling bad guys, no moral ambiguity, and heros of perfect character and grace who never make a mistake.

Watch it for the fun, but then go read a book by a real historian to de-program yourself.",1512950400,6,1008,5.1656441717791415
8720955,5,B00ZVAD1VE,"Well, I think this was excellent, the acting was superb, and I honestly believe when all the writers of these different accounts of what is our American History and Independence, wrote  them,.. they really could have cared less about the  so called "" train wreck"" you poor little fairies sadly experienced.
 This series was loaded with many of our greatest actors of this present day and time,...  And the casting director did one hell of a job picking the right person for his or her part.  And furthermore, any individual (two),...who would give this great show a one star, Is without a doubt a whining democratic donkey and probably voted for (he haw, he haw)""hillary"" !
 You two lonely voters were meant for each other.  Thanks to the Internet,  the whiners finally have a place to speak their tiny minds !
 Wooooooooooooooooooooooo !! Thank ya!",1512432000,,849,4.8

8720957,5,B00ZVAD1VE,"Enjoyed watching this...Sam Adams doing bar Olympics ?...probably not, but enjoyed it anyway...Any attempt to bring to life American History will always be welcomed by me...Many accurate references to The French and Indian War...underscores the fact that wealthy and prominent men became outcasts and traitors in the eyes of the British Empire...",1509753600,,346,5.673076923076923
8720958,5,B00ZVAD1VE,Some theatrical license taken in a couple scenes but overall pretty good. Thoroughly enjoyed watching the series.,1509148800,,113,5.705882352941177
8720959,1,B00ZVAD1VE,"Not sure why I watched this again, I must be sadistic.  I enjoy American history and historical fiction but this is absurd.  If you remember when this originally appeared on (gulp) The History Channel, it opened with Sam Adams escaping the British with his Nija-like reflexes as he jumped from roof top to roof top. Guess who was the sponsor? Sam Adams beer.  I should have turned it off then but who can turn away from a train wreck.  If you have ever watched TURN, you know that historical TV can be done well and done accurately without dumbing it down for the masses. My opinion of The History Channel and Sam Adams Beer Company have never recovered, I shall never forgive them for unleashing this drivel.",1507507200,3,709,4.559055118110236
