Richard Burton too was well cast as Mark, the king who couldn't capture the love of his young bride. I was mesmerized by the story, as well as the beautiful scenery it was shot in. It touched well on the brutality of the time period, as well as the mystical and magical elements (love potions, monsters, lepers... etc.) The only part that disappointed me was the final shot. Tristan and Isolt are desperately trying to get close enough to each other to die together and just as they touch hands the camera pans up above them to Mark standing on the beach with the low waves lapping at his legs. The lovers are basically cut out of the pictures to get closer to Richard Burton. I wonder whose idea that was? Just a wide pan with the lovers dying at his feet and Mark in the background would have been much more poignant. However, other than that... it was a great movie...and now one of my favorite Kate Mulgrew performances.",1501459200,,1012,4.505434782608695
8009844,5,B0001BVD4U,"Dieser Film ist wirklich wundervoll. Er vermittelt eine zauberhafte Stimmung und ist ist auch von der schauspielerischen Qualitt einwandfrei. ber die Verfilmung historischer oder literarischer Stoffe kann man sich streiten. Oft ist eine freie Interpretation im Film besser. Hier, bei diesem Meisterwerk, stimmt alles.",1284595200,,317,6.2272727272727275
8009845,5,B0001BVD4U,"See this movie for Nicholas Clay and Kate Mulgrew - Richard Burton does not do the part of Mark justice and seems miscast, whereas Clay and Mulgrew absolutely steal the show. Clay does an outstanding job as usual and he and Mulgrew are perfectly matched. Clay delivers each word with Shakespearean accuracy and authenticity - with each word he makes you feel as though you are watching a great theater performance - he is a joy as always to watch and outshines everyone. One of the most fascinating scenes in the film is their discussion of fear. I like how Tristan suggests how we take a fear of the unknown and break it down into ""manageable"" proportions so we can deal with it on some level, therefore reducing it to some extent. Clay's delivery of this dialogue is riveting, and his reaction when she calls him on his lecturing is quite stunning. Mulgrew and Clay together have a great chemistry as well, and this scene is about as tight as it gets between two actors.

It is also ironic that this ""lovespell"" in the story is what joins them together through life and beyond death, because actually, they were in love and bound together forever before she shared the elixir with him. It is not the potion that makes him love her through no choice of his own, but his own free will that makes that a reality. Perhaps the ""spell"" is really just the true power of natural romantic love, chemistry between two people, attraction, and the enigma of those human feelings.",1243296000,2,1469,4.585551330798479
8009846,5,B0001BVD4U,"One of my personal favorite movies. Richard Burton is ONE OF THE BEST actors I've seen in my life. He is, like this movie, an absolute pleasure to watch. I always smile when I see this film. It will make you feel good. One of the best movies ever.",1199664000,7,247,4.061224489795919

LoveSpell is a charming and subtle film. The characters are well cast. But I don't think that the movie budget did justice to what the film makers were trying to do. Tristan shows well his emotional torture at seeing the woman he loves married to another man. Isolt is earthy and sweet. Richard Burton as the possessive King Mark is well chosen for his ability to show intensity at his desperate attempts to force Isolt to love him. Burton's portrayal of Mark is similar to his porformance as King Henry VIII in Anne of the thousand days. My favorite elements of the film are the moments of brilliant and beautiful dialogue, the music performed by the Chieftains, and of beautiful Ireland.",1194739200,6,825,5.6

Kate Mulgrew in fantastic and Richard Burton is fascinating",1169078400,5,84,5.461538461538462
8009849,4,B0001BVD4U,"It really helps to know the full story of Tristran and Isult in order to enjoy this movie. For instance, there are several references to Tristan's victory over Marholt, which is both a monster and Isult's uncle. And there are a number of story elements that come up in the second half of the movie that probably don't make any sense unless you are already aware of them, like the second Isult that Tristran meets up with. I like the approach that the director takes to the material, an approach that can be quite successful when used with myth or folktale or stories set in the dark ages. It's a straightforward, almost simple-minded approach, without over-dramatization or clever narrative touches.  This works very well in the first part of the movie, when it is a story of characters meeting and falling in love.  But this approach can't handle the second half of the movie which needs a lot of exposition. And the final sequence, which unfortunately does get a laugh when it shouldn't, I think was botched in the editing room or something, because I think there is a way to make it work with all the same elements. (You know, how sometimes the difference between comedy and tragedy is slim.)  Some movies that succeed in this approach are The Virgin Spring, The Song of Bernadette, and Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors.  But Lovespell has fabulous art design and scenery. Green Ireland, old castles (exteriors and interiors), drinking cups and wooden chests. Seeing Richard Burton's red, soft-leather doublet is almost worth the movie itself!",1151884800,4,1548,4.8522727272727275

8009851,2,B0001BVD4U,"much closer than the new movie ""Tristan & Isolde"" that's out now.  Why does Hollywood believe they can improve on a story that's been told for over fourteen centuries?  If you're going to make a movie of this subject or any other well known tale then just follow it.  Why is that so difficult?  They made a mess of Homer's Iliad in ""Troy"".  What a waste of money.  It's the story, stupid.  Not the special effects.

Lovespell, unfortunately, while adhering pretty closely to the original story doesn't satisfy.  The costumes, sets and music are good.  It does convey what 6th century Cornwall probably looked like.

The best part of the movie is the beginning when Mark meets Isolde in Ireland.  Richard Burton's performance is very good.  Kate Mulgrew more than holds her own opposite him.  They are both believeable, and likeable in their scenes together.  The third side of their triangle, Tristan, played by Nicholas Clay hardly seems there.  I think the problem is with the way the part is written.  There just doesn't seem much else for him to do except stare longingly at Isolde.

The movie begins after Tristan defeats Isolde's uncle the Morholt in Cornwall.  Mark actually travels to Ireland to meet with Isolde's uncle about returning Cornish treasure stolen by the Morholt.  Mark sends Tristan to Ireland to ask for Isolde's hand.  There is no mistaken identity here.  The two, of course, fall in love.  Once in Cornwall Isolde decides to share the magic love potion with Tristan.  Her choice didn't make much sense written this way, but oh well.  From there on the tale winds down to the lovers being discovered and parted.  Tristan's relationship with Isolde of the White Hands is not explored.  She's merely his nurse in Brittany.

The ending is almost laughable the way it's staged as Isolde trips and falls off a cliff while the wounded Tristan jumps off the ship he's returning to Cornwall on.  Mark jumps in after him and swims him to shore where the lovers crawl across the rocks to touch hands before dying.

At roughly 1 hour 30 minutes the film moves pretty quickly.  I wish the makers had used the extra 30 minutes and included more of the original story.  As produced, the movie lacks the emotional power of the original tale.  Richard Burton does his best, but the script fails him.

I'll give it three stars for the production values, but the script is definitely no more than a two and a half.  I recommend it for the authenticity of the production and the performances of Richard Burton and Kate Mulgrew.",1138838400,3,2532,4.7162471395881
