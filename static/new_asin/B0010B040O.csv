8237568,5,B0010B040O,Great new ideas blending dancing and pilates.  Wonderful for dancers to try as it feels so familiar.  Easy to follow for any dancer.  Well worth the money.,1266364800,,155,4.666666666666667
8237569,5,B0010B040O,"I found the Julian Littleford workout to be a great addition to my current weight training and cardio workouts. The direction that he provides on how to perform the moves is very clear and easy to follow. I also like the fact that, now that I know the moves and no longer need so much direction, I can forward past the breakdown straight to my workout. It is very apparent that Julian Littleford is passionate about Pilates and how it compliments dance.",1210896000,,453,4.536585365853658
