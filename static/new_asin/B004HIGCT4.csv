4375772,1,B004HIGCT4,"For the most part, the reviewer who stated that this movie had major plot holes is 100% correct. This movie makes no sense. It is based on the premise that rescuing people can be dangerous. The filmmakers may have tried to create the suspense of movies like ""Triangle,"" as the film starts out on a boat (well, after a role-playing scene in the desert that makes absolutely no sense anyway), and then ends up on an island. On the island, it turns into a snooze-fest. Nothing happens until the very end, and the reason for the ending was never really explained. Looking at the cover art for the movie, you'd expect to see a ton of nudity and gore, and there is absolutely none. At least it could have been suspenseful, but the writers/directors couldn't even give us that. And it was so poorly acted that the transitions between visions and reality could not even be depicted at times by those viewing the film. This is easily one of the worst films so far in 2011.",1301788800,4,963,4.4772727272727275
4375773,1,B004HIGCT4,"I would issue a ""spoiler alert,"" but this movie has little or nothing to spoil. So if I tried to explain the movie, you wouldn't get what it was about, then after watching it, you would realize that I told you everything. There just wasn't much there. I wanted to try and give it two stars, but I couldn't do it in good conscience. If you are looking for an American remake of a Japanese movie of the same name, this isn't it. The name is, I suppose, a coincidence. Fortunately, I wasn't looking for that. If you are interested in something sexy as the cover photo implies, that basically fell extremely short too. There was a bit implied, but nothing really there either. As for it possibly being a horror movie, I just didn't find anything interesting enough to catch my attention and, as such movies go, there wasn't anything that scary or suspenseful.

There wasn't any background information to know what was going on with the ""evil"" lady they come into contact with on the island and the characters left a bit to be defined also. Basically, it was a boring movie that didn't seem to even try and redeem itself. The first 45 minutes surely could have been cut altogether and you wouldn't have missed any of it.",1300924800,6,1215,4.497737556561086
4375774,2,B004HIGCT4,"Siren is a step above the film quality of most straight-to-video movies, but a weak story plagued with plot holes makes for a confusing film.

Siren tells the story of a group of friends who make a weekend getaway by sailing the coast. They discover a secluded island with an injured man, and a mysterious woman with a dark secret. The longer they remain on the island, the more the friends experience a twisted blur between nightmares and reality.

The good news about the movie is that it was filmed entirely off the coast of Tunisia in Northern Africa, so we're treated to beautiful scenes of the beach and ocean. Director Andrew Hull has a few other low-budget movies under his belt, and the production quality of Siren is a bit better than most Redbox flicks. Despite most of the cast having only appeared in a few obscure movies, they do a decent job in this film.

The bad news is that the film is filled with plot holes. Even the first five minutes of the film, before the sailing trip begins, includes a creepy bathroom scene that is never explained nor revisited. While some mystery is good, and can create suspense, the film becomes annoying near the conclusion due to a lack of explanations. Even the dialogue stops making sense as the movie draws to a close.

Keep in mind that this movie doesn't really reflect the Sirens of Greek mythology, so even knowing their story doesn't give you the full picture. The only way I discovered what the plot was really about was by checking out the deleted scenes in the DVD extras. For reasons that I'll never understand, a clip titled ""Tale of the Siren"" was removed from the movie. It offers an explanation of who the mysterious girl is, her connection to one of the travelers, and why tragedy befalls visitors to the island. It's only after watching the deleted scene that the story and certain scenes make sense, but by then I was a bit disappointed with the movie.

There's a bit of gore in the movie, though it's nothing along the lines of being a ""slasher"" flick. There are also a few sex scenes, though there's oddly no frontal nudity in the movie. The DVD cover really has nothing to do with the film, either.

Overall, I wasn't impressed with this movie. If you plan on renting it, it's a must that you watch the deleted scenes afterwards if you want a better understanding of the story. Give this one a rent before you even consider buying it.",1300924800,16,2406,4.532258064516129
4375775,2,B004HIGCT4,"What would you do if rescuing people turned out to be a mistake.  After thier boat bottoms out trying to save a drowning victim a group of friends discover a beautiful woman on a deserted island.  After inviting her to join them the group starts to experience strange visions, along with having problems trying to leave.  It may be skewed because the movies I watched before this were pretty boring, but this one actually wasn't too bad.  It has some overused characters, the cocky boyfriend, the pretty girlfriend, the best friend in love with the girlfriend, and the strange hot girl who everyone falls in love with instantly.  If I was up on my mythology I probebly would have noticed some things that may have made this more interesting, but overall there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. I give it a C+.

Would I watch again? - Probebly not, but you never know.",1300492800,,877,4.518987341772152

4375777,2,B004HIGCT4,"The acting was atrocious, but the sex scenes were awesome. The director should have just turned it into a porno, then it could have been the best porno ever as the plot was more than enough for a porn movie but not quite enough for a theatrical release. It's never a good thing when you don't care if all the characters die.",1360281600,2,324,4.241935483870968

4375779,1,B004HIGCT4,"SIREN is one of those movies you can't believe you watched, let alone bought!  Don't fall for the deceptional cover cause it has nothing to do with the movie.
The mythical story of sirens who lured sailors to their death with their seductive singing could've made an interesting premise.  However, the script for SIREN bounces all over the place, inserting senseless allusions to what is real and what isn't.  Throw in the inevitably boring lesbian scenes to add to the confusion.  The siren herself is about as menacing as a slug and while lovely is hardly worth dying for.  So much of the movie doesn't make sense, and it's really boring.  The ending is both predictable and unimpressive.
An ambulance ride with sirens blazing is more terrifying!",1310947200,6,748,4.850393700787402
4375780,1,B004HIGCT4,This was so boring. The quality of the film and the acting weren't bad. But nothing happened really other then weird hallucinations or something. I don't even know cause its never explained. I was just utterly bored for the ENTIRE movie.,1307923200,5,237,4.804878048780488
4375781,5,B004HIGCT4,"Three friends on a boating cruise find themselves encountering a Siren - a beautiful female creature from Greek mythology who lures sailors to their deaths - on an isolated island in ""Siren"", perhaps the most under-rated movie to be released in recent memory.

  Two men and a woman - the girlfriend of one of the guys - are on a voyage on gorgeous waters, but a voyage already underlined by tension within the group - the other male member of the crew is the former flame of the boat's female occupant, and her current beau is the paranoid, rather controlling type.  When the small crew comes across an island deep in the sea with a bedraggled man on the coast desperately waving for help, they go to his aid.  But the castaway - delirious, fearstruck, and speaking a language they don't understand - goes into convulsions and dies as the boat attempts to sail away from the island.  In what could be seen as an illogical move, rather than simply report the death to local authorities, the trio - afraid of being blamed for the castaway's condition and death - decide to return to the island and bury him in an annonymous grave.  I don't think this is necessarily as big a flaw in reasoning as it may seem; the Siren of the film exerts a subtle but strong influence on the minds of those around her, and this sudden phobia and excuse to return to the island brings the trio right back to her.  Once returned, they encounter the woman 'Silka', not knowing what she really is.  The island seems to be a paradise, but it hasn't yet set in that this is a paradise they may never be able to leave.

  The nature of the Siren, though certain revelations and hints come out, is never fully explained.  Though she seems to thrive off the lifeforce of people she strands on the island, she doesn't appear to be truly evil.  More spider-like, perhaps - to the fly trapped in a spider's web, spinning that web right where flies are likely to get caught up in it would probably seem pretty mean; to the spider it's just doing what comes naturally.  The movie is atmospheric, sexy, and a visual feast.  The island/ocean setting is gorgeous, and full of striking moments.  There's one scene of Silka and Rachel walking towards the ocean under a moonlit sky that's particularly memorable.  The island itself is vibrant and utopian, although other parts of it appear much sparser, almost stunted - the question arises from this and from other moments, how much of the island is precisely the way the trio is perceiving it, and how much is the Siren's physcic influence?  There's even a vague feeling there may actually be more than one reality of the island overlapping one another.

  Siren has elements of a horror movie, a thriller, a fantasy movie and a drama, although it doesn't fit any field precisely.  Though that may be part of the reason for the movie's less-than-stellar reception, for fans who love genre-hybrid movies (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invisible/dp/B000TAN904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invisible</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-River/dp/B00466OVJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood River</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Altitude/dp/B003WJ6VDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Altitude</a>), this is a terrific treat.",1307923200,6,3590,5.570902394106814
4375782,2,B004HIGCT4,"The cover is of something that doesn't happen in the film - no bikini clad knife wielding babes.

Disconnects abound in this film. From the very start Rachel (Anna Skellern) stands alone on a desert highway in a sexy red dress. She's hitchhiking. She's picked up by Ken (Eoin Macken) and as they drive along she places a hand between her legs. He catches sight of this and they almost drive off the road.

They pull over and she goes into a bathroom stall. He follows. They go to make love only she sees a mysterious man's face. There's no man in any other stall. And there's the next disconnect. The vision of the man leads to nothing.

Further, Rachel and Ken know each other and were play-acting a role of hitchhiker and driver. They don't even continue their love-making. They just change into other clothes and move on down to a port.

This film's full of these things that lead nowhere.

Along with Marco (Anthony Jabre) they sail till they are lured to an island who's sole living occupant, Silka (Tereza Srbova) - the Siren of the title leads them into realms of unreality where they're not sure what's real and what's not.

Then the film becomes more confused!

4375783,4,B004HIGCT4,"Though the film lacks a little in the plot department, it definitely makes up with some sexy / scary moments. This is really your typical lo-budget horror flick, but as far as they go, this one is up there with the best. Follows the story of 3 friends who are taking a sailing trip and end up trapped on a desert island with some possessed woman who is killing them one by one with her siren's song.

4375784,4,B004HIGCT4,"Though I am someone that prides himself on his taste in good movies, I cannot help but have a soft spot for these B-horror movies. Though this is not what I would call terrifying, it is hilariously entertaining. Basic premise is three friends that go out for a holiday of sun and relaxation on a rented boat, suddenly find themselves facing some evil Siren-women, who is hypnotizing them with her song and killing them off one by one. Not the greatest plot, but I've seen worse (what the late night stuff on the Sci-Fi channel and you'll see what I mean). Take into account the mild sex scenes in the film and this makes for an easy night with a beer.",1302566400,,651,4.3884297520661155

8429573,1,B004HIGCT4,This is the worst movie known to man. I have seen some absolute horrible movies in my day however this movie puts them all to shame I highly advise that if you watch this movie you let it run and you take a nap during the meantime and turn off all the volume.  Best and good luck. If you watch this you'll need all the luck in the world to stay awake.,1414454400,,351,3.875
8429574,4,B004HIGCT4,"I believe that, in general, a Siren is supposed to be an allegory for inner thoughts and desires that we know that are bad for us, but we still can't avoid.  The pull, the sound of her voice, is simply too strong.  But ultimately, that ""inner voice,"" if we can't tune her out, will eventually destroy us.

Well, at least that's what I got out of ""Siren.""  And I do think that it's a pretty danged underappreciated film.

Tereza Srbova, while she should consider buying a vowel for her last name -- I'm teasing a bit, as I believe she was born in Prague, a city in which I've visited -- is surely a strong actress here.  She really reminded me of Mia Farrow in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and I surely wouldn't be surprised if that character was used here as inspiration for this Siren.  In this surely-lesser-but-not-by-much film, Ms. Srbova has a really spooky quality without overdoing it.  She is particularly haunting while singing, and from some external reading, she is talented in real life in that area so the voice you hear in the movie is most likely hers.

And the rest of the cast isn't too shabby, particularly the other female lead.  Overall, I thought that the cinematography was very good as well.  Plus, you get to check out some pretty killer GOG action as well; nothing wrong with that.

For the life of me, I can't understand why this film has gotten such low ratings.  OK; maybe I can.  Perhaps an American audience is not sophisticated enough for this type of film, what with movies such as ""Transformers"" and ""Twilight"" being so popular.  Sure, you might argue at this is a cheap shot, a below-the-belt ad hominem, and you'd have a point.  But it still is mostly true, I believe.

Well, this film seems to say that we will always hear the song of our desires, and there always will be a price to be paid for it.  But I'll say that the price of this film is not too high, and you should listen to me when I sing the praises of ""Siren.""",1412553600,2,1948,4.408963585434174
