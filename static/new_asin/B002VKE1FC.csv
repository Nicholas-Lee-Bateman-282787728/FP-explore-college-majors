8477736,1,B002VKE1FC,"First off, I don't think Weird Al Yankovic (Or ""Yankovich"" as he's listed on the back cover here) knows he's involved with an ""import"" Nirvana video collection, but there it is, the video for Smells Like Nirvana. There are digital blocks between every video like this was made with a 90s MPEG-joiner. Several of the videos are 4:3 videos awkwardly stretched to 16:9 like a widescreen TV with the stretch feature enabled. I'm trying to figure out where these videos are sourced from. The first few seconds of every song are black as if they're trying to obscure which TV source it came from. Come As You Are = VHS, Heart Shaped Box = The Anton Corbijn DVD played with the stretch feature enabled and filmed off a TV with an HD camera?. In Bloom version 1 is clearly off of the Sub Pop video compilation DVD (I'm sure they have no idea) In Bloom I can't tell. Lithium = VHS, Weird Al VHS, Smells Like Teen Spirit VHS.... You Know You're Right straight-up has the titles on-screen the entire time like it came off an in-store promotional DVD they'd play in a Blockbuster Video. The In Bloom (all dresses version) video has an MTV logo in the corner. You get the point here... All Apologies is from Unplugged but they couldn't even spring to bootleg it off the official TV, its off a tv recording, so is Man Who Sold the World. Sappy is a fan-made video for god's sake. What's incredible is if offers 5.1 DTS, Dolby Digital 5.1 as if multichannel versions of these songs even exist in the first place. This is crazy. This is a crazy item.",1391472000,2,1534,4.443262411347518
