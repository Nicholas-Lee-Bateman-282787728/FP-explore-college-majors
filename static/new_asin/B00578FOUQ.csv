8460388,5,B00578FOUQ,"I have enjoyed this dvd for about a year.  It is a fun dance dvd that resembles Nia.  In fact, I think Kendra was a Nia teacher.  The music is more global than Nia.  Also the movement has elements of latin and african dance.  It is very doable for new exercisers.

It takes place on a soundstage with Kendra and 4 dancers.  If you have ever taken a Nia class or done one of their dvds, you will be right at home. Hoping she makes another one this year.",1366416000,,452,4.01123595505618
