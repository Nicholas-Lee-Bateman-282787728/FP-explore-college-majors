6433328,4,B00KLF5RHA,"A stilted story with too much mini-issues that could have been put aside...
A storyline  that gives a small window of the conflicts an  individual struggling to understand the connection to his ancestors.
to some degree the struggle of a race facing an uncertain future as their connection to the past are being compromised for the tourist industry....
A small beginning of introducing the Hawaiians in a different light.....there are so much documentaries available that have provide a better window to the history and the indigenous people of Hawaii.
Hopefully this movie will make more people search out the social history of the islands.....",1407974400,,645,5.1923076923076925
6433329,5,B00KLF5RHA,"I loved this movie because I feel like it gave me a better understanding of hula and Hawaiian culture. Being an independent movie, there were places where you could tell the film was a little low budget... but this movie shows the hard work and devotion that goes into truly studying hula. Most people think hula is grass skirts and coconuts, but that's because they never get to hear the non-touristy side of hula: the specific knowledge you need which has been passed down for generations, the dedication that requires hours of practice, the study of the Hawaiian language to know what you are dancing, etc. As a dancer myself, this film helped me to understand where hula came from. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their understanding of hula or of Hawaiian culture.",1407801600,32,790,4.731884057971015

I was born in New Zealand.  My parents had myself and my siblings learn the songs, chants, dances, and legends of all the Polynesian islands.  I love the heritage of the South Pacific.  This film was touching in having the main character be taught by the best and returning to his roots to share his knowledge.  Beautiful scenes, gorgeous dances, wonderful storyline.

So I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I will definitely be watching it again and again. You get a good feeling of family ohana, and there are some wonderful dance scenes. I felt like I was allowed into a Halau to watch them learn and prepare for performing. Just what I had hoped for. I'd love to see more movies like this made!",1436140800,6,486,4.180851063829787

6433356,1,B00KLF5RHA,"This movie has a lot of potential, but I get the feeling it was made more for Hawaiians who know about hula. It's not descriptive at all so if you don't know a lot about hula you'll be confused throughout the movie, and find yourself asking a lot of questions. It needs more details about hula if it's going to be a movie about hula.",1433203200,,333,4.138461538461539

6433360,4,B00KLF5RHA,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie a lot and would watch any others made by the same crew.  That said, it seemed almost as though the movie was made for those who know hula and Hawai'iana well, for there were a lot of messages in the film that could have been made more clear to the uninitiated.  Johnny's learning curve could have been an excellent vehicle for a a more overt presentation of how the old traditions are being overrun by modernism and greed, and the saving power of the re-blossoming of aloha 'aina through traditions like (non-tourist) hula.  Overall, though, an excellent and worthy first effort.  Robert Cazimero was among the consultants for the film, and sings during the credits.  A beautiful video of this song, not shown in the film, is available here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfaTWkj7PE.",1430611200,7,820,4.9489051094890515

6433370,5,B00KLF5RHA,"Thoughtful melodrama about hula, family, and tradition in Hawai'i, featuring some beautiful music by the Brothers Cazimero, breathtaking scenery, and heartfelt and generously crafted performances from local cast members (and a few adoptive mainland cast members, too).  I'd like to particularly mention the young actors playing the group of hula students.  I'd like to see this type of local film-making abundantly encouraged, supported, and funded.  I'd like to see it take off.  In the meantime, I think it's a good start to buy this film. watch it, and tell your friends.  There are so many rich Hawaiian stories to share with the world through film.  This is one of them, and it's a fine start.  The wave will come.",1423353600,2,719,4.991596638655462

6433402,5,B00KLF5RHA,We learn from each other so no matter if you are the official teacher or the student when you work together on a project - in this case toward a dance competition - you must respect each other and realize each person's strengths and weaknesses.  We can draw on those strengths and shore up the weak areas by watching and listening.  Our culture sometimes forgets the importance of each person and only focuses on the most obvious strenths or weaknesses without taking in the entire picture.  This movie has a great message while still being entertaining.  Of course the music is an extra bonus with great artists.,1409616000,11,613,4.700934579439252

6433405,5,B00KLF5RHA,"As a ""haole"" who lived in the Islands, fell in love with the culture, and now dances hula to stay connected to that culture, I loved this film! Its creative source, Keo Woolford, has previously created a one-man stage show that expressed his own personal journey away from, and back to, his home culture, and he's done an admirable job of expanding on that theme with this film. Having lived in Hawaii I recognized all the different relationships to culture and hula represented by the characters in the film, and the people felt real and honest to me. Robert Cazimero's incomparable spirit, leadership and inspiration in the dance itself comes through, and the story stands as a successful parable on being true to one's self, family, and roots.",1408665600,20,746,4.8359375
