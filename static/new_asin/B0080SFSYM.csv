5116776,5,B0080SFSYM,"This workout is awesome! Been eyeing it for a while, but wasn't sure I wanted to invest. SO glad I did. You may have done all kinds of kickboxing workouts and dvd's, but actually doing it on a heavy bag, is a totally different experience. You can feel every part of your body getting worked. She integrates other full body movements into the boxing segments-mountain climbers, dips on the bag, step ups. Each DVD is different. I feel so good when I finish. Every ounce of stress is gone. I feel so strong and like I could kick some booty!! This is not an easy workout, but it goes fast because you are constantly changing the moves. I can definitely feel my energy level dropping some when you change sides on the second half of the dvd's.
I have my bag outside, so I purchased the 9 inch portable Verazano dvd player here on Amazon and it's awesome to use to watch and do this workout outside.
Tjis set is a little bit of an investment but you get a lot of dvd's for your money and it's so worth it.",1377648000,9,1000,4.2408376963350785
5116777,5,B0080SFSYM,"I hesitated purchasing this because I never heard of Addiction Fitness.  I am so glad I bought this product.  This is a fun, advanced interval boxing workout that uses a heavy bag.  The results I am getting are phenomenal.  Highly recommended!",1366502400,11,243,4.853658536585366
5116778,4,B0080SFSYM,The workout is not just a boxing workout but a combination of different exercises.  Works up a sweat and a great workout,1360886400,6,120,4.454545454545454
5116779,5,B0080SFSYM,"This video is great.  I was surprised because it includes a lot of other exercises in addition to punching/kicking the bag.  So you might punch the bag for a couple of minutes, then get down on the floor and do ""mountain climbers"" for a minute, then up and kick the bag, then do tricept dips on the base of the bag, etc.  The tutorial was also good for those of us who don't always remember the different kinds of punches.  The only negative is that the video is somewhat cheaply done - the tutorial was shot in someone's living room - but that doesn't mean the exercises and instructor aren't good.  Also note: these videos are designed for people who already have a pretty good fitness level (like P90X), but that being said, I am out of shape and just did as much as I could (e.g. I could do most of the exercises but at half the speed that they did them on the videos). All in all, I'd buy it again and recommend the set.",1350000000,29,925,4.203389830508475
5116780,1,B0080SFSYM,Its a good workout but the music is so annoying that I cant concentrate on what I am doing.  I just want the music to STOP!  Its too late to get a refund or I would send it back.,1455753600,2,178,3.5384615384615383
5116781,4,B0080SFSYM,"Exceptionally challenging series of DVDs that will kick your butt.  Seriously my glutes are still killing me five days after doing DISC IV this weekend.  If you are in need of a real full body workout to up your cardio game and build muscle, all while keeping you interested, this is a great series to pick up.  I truly admire the actors in the series- they don't even break a sweat!",1455148800,,383,4.366197183098592
5116782,4,B0080SFSYM,good punch.,1448323200,,11,5.0
5116783,3,B0080SFSYM,"Good concept, but the way they videotaped the sessions isn't quite user friendly.",1439683200,,81,5.3076923076923075
5116784,2,B0080SFSYM,"The workout just wasn't my style. I was trying something different because my sister has this workout and has certain DVDs in the collection that she loves!  It was too expensive to keep if I didn't LOVE it and I wasn't a fan of my heart rate not staying higher.  There is nothing wrong with the workout itself or the instructor, just not my taste.  I can keep my heart rate up high with Jillian kickboxing DVDs so I will stick with those and my Cathe collection for now.",1438905600,,471,4.269662921348314
5116785,5,B0080SFSYM,"It's hard to find at-home boxing workouts and this is a good one, although the price is way too high.  It's a challenge, but I'd put it in the ""high-intermediate"" category, not super-duper advanced like how I imagine Insanity to be.  You can make the workouts lots easier by just chopping them in half.  They come with an intermission, so you can stop there and save the second half for the next day if you want, especially in the beginning or if you want to use the segments as ""add-ons"" for another workout routine. The box comes with a suggested Addiction Fitness schedule that will put you at four workouts/week.  The workouts are about 45 minutes long.  I'm just doing two/week for now, in addition to other things.

The exercises are very basic and done with a timer on the bottom of the screen.  Each new move is ""announced"" in writing near the timer, so I find this is a good set to turn the volume down and use with your own music once you get the hang of it.  Merle also announces the new moves by shouting them, but she's not giving a lot of form pointers so you don't miss a lot by turning off the volume.  The ""set"" is just their outdoor gym area.  At times it's sunnier or cloudier; sometimes it cuts back and forth because of how they spliced the segment together but that probably won't bother you.

The program is led by a woman and most of the background exercisers are women, but I don't see any reason why men wouldn't like it.  In fact, my husband likes it because there aren't fancy-dancy, complicated moves.  Who doesn't like punching stuff?

I agree with the other reviewer who said she was surprised at the lack of promotions with this set.  I did expect to see more things like success stories, Facebook forums, etc.  AF has a FB page, but it's not really geared up to get you more jazzed about the set.  It's sort of too bad because there are way cheaper programs out there that have built up a big following of fans and give out occasional freebie live workout downloads, etc.  I'm not sure why this one didn't get that kind of attention.  At the least it would be fun to have a place to chat about it.

Unfortunately you need to buy a lot to try this training at home.  Hopefully you have already punched a bag somewhere and know you like doing it before you pay for all this stuff.  Check Craigslist for a second-hand Wavemaster and be sure to get grappling/training gloves.  You may also want a mat because you sometimes drop to the floor for things like push-ups.",1438819200,4,2495,4.387799564270153
5116786,4,B0080SFSYM,"Here are the goods and the bads:
Good: very intense work out, variety of exercise routines, good music to go with it, pays attention to alternating left and right side.  Sweat more than in my gym kickboxing class.  Overall, great workout.

Bad: no synopsis with the discs on what's included into all of them, no warm up or cool down, no abs exercises.  compared to my gym kickboxing classes that I took with the actual instructor, I don't seem to be toning my arm muscles quite as well.",1438128000,5,486,4.488636363636363
5116787,3,B0080SFSYM,"Definitely a advanced workout,and you definitely need to have a standing bag to preform the excercises. (A swinging bag will not allow you to keep up with the instructor).",1435363200,3,171,4.931034482758621
5116788,5,B0080SFSYM,"Awesome workout!  Even though its a low production dvd, it leads you thru a tough, sweaty workout. I like the fact there isn't dialogue thru the workout.  She sets you up & then you get to concentrate on the moves. With 5 DVD's you never get bored. This is one DVD collection that has created a major difference in weight loss & definition for me.",1433721600,3,347,4.323076923076923

5116793,5,B0080SFSYM,"Product arrived in good condition. I viewed all the cds to ensure that they were working properly- so far it seems to be ok. The workouts are progressively challenging and it looks like a good workout.  Yes, it was a low budget taping but I liked the workouts which is what matters.  I probably modify some things but overall it seems like an excellent workout.",1416441600,2,361,4.538461538461538
5116794,5,B0080SFSYM,"I love these DVD's!!! I was hesitant to buy because of the price. After reading the other reviews, I decided to try it out. The format is awesome. Expectations are set in the beginning. The transistion between intervals is smooth. The cool down is 8 minutes longs and stretches out your entire body.

5116796,5,B0080SFSYM,"Just completed day 1 workout and boy was it a killer. If your looking for a heart pumping, boxing/kickboxing working, you need these DVDs. I don't write reviews often but this workout is awesome. I could barely finish the whole thing. Be prepared for sweat and pain. You feel this workouts!",1399507200,6,290,4.705882352941177
5116797,5,B0080SFSYM,"I searched for a DVD heavy bag training program for several weeks, if not months. There are little to be found, though I did find some young guys who liked to show off with little training. When I viewed Addiction Fitness' videos, I was already impressed. Though I have to say that I was a little doubtful because of so little reviews. However, I have found these videos to be awesome. I love the 45-minute training each morning. There is an instructional video that comes with 5 training DVDs. Each one is unique and has given me a great workout. In fact, it has challenged me and left me finding muscles I didn't know I even had! I was so impressed with the videos that I searched out the trainer, Merle Silver, but she is nowhere to be found on the internet. I wish she would continue her endeavors in fitness.",1397174400,12,813,4.3907284768211925
5116798,4,B0080SFSYM,"I have used this for 5 days straight and love it. It definitely works everything and I will say I have to stop at times to take a quick break. I also have to say that I am sore so I know its working :) One last thing, I wish it offered a bit more ab work into the workouts and a separate stretching video for the price.",1381881600,10,319,3.7058823529411766

8523804,5,B0080SFSYM,"I used to have a membership at a kickboxing gym but it got way too expensive. I bought a century bag on Amazon and this was the only DVD I could find that actually used a ""heavy"" bag and incorporated other cardio exercises. It's a great work out and keeps me motivated to follow along. It beats paying $100+/month.",1502582400,2,314,4.338983050847458
8523805,5,B0080SFSYM,I really like this set. I have a hanging heavy bag. I made some adjustments to the workout when it calls for step ups on the bag base and dips using the bag base. I like that there isn't a lot of chatter during the workouts. Being cheered on is fine but gets old when you've done it so many times that you know the script word for word. Some of the punching sequences seem a bit long to me but that may be because I prefer the kicking. The moves are not complicated so you don't have to keep checking to see if your doing it correctly. I've purchased other non boxing workouts since but keep going back to these.,1493510400,,612,4.066115702479339
8523806,4,B0080SFSYM,"There are not a lot of heavy bag workouts available, so it's definitely nice to find one that includes 5 complete workouts.  That alone, makes it a worthy buy.  For the price, there are a few things that could have been done better.  For one, the cool down at the end of each video is the same.  They recorded it once and put it at the end of all 5 dvd's.  It gets tedious, so I find myself changing it up on my own.  Second, while boxing in general is great for your core, there is no concentrated core work.  I tend to do it on my own during the ""90 second"" break at the middle of the workout.  I also do it during mundane portions of the workouts. (i.e. several minutes of mock jump roping on disc 3)  Finally, the actual effort put in by the people in the videos is not very inspiring.  They are pretty much tapping the bag when they ""kick"".  I usually ignore their pace and do my own so I can really punch and kick for better strength training.  Other than that, aside from the annoying music that home workout videos are famous for, I have to say I'm really glad to have this set.  Even though I'm changing it up quite a bit on my own, it gives me a base workout to work with.  With 5 workouts, I can do something different each time.  I like it.",1492387200,2,1252,4.053061224489796
8523807,3,B0080SFSYM,"I purchased a heavybag and wanted some dvds to get a more structured workout. These workouts are OK but I wanted more punching and kicking, not all the fluff in between like mountain climbers, jumping jacks, pushups, surrenders, etc.",1489881600,,233,5.0
8523808,5,B0080SFSYM,I don't usually leave reviews but after trying this video out I had to! This was by far the best workout video I have tried. I have never sweated so much in my life! At first I was hesitant to purchase because of the cost but I am happy I did! I burnt 450 calories using the first DVD!,1485648000,,285,3.847457627118644
8523809,4,B0080SFSYM,"There are few heavy bag workout DVDs available, and this one is excellent in terms of the workout.  You will sweat and get a great cardio workout in only 45 minutes (and aside from punching and kicking, you also do mountain climbers and other plyometric exercises).  My primary complaint is that it does not demonstrate proper form in some of the striking.  They do not often make heavy contact with the bag during punches and kicks (many kicks are more like taps), possibly because their bags are free standing and not fixed. Also, some moves are not advisable on a vertical bag, such as uppercuts which should ideally make contact to a horizontal object. So when uppercuts are instructed in the video, they are really modified hooks (in addition to actual hooks). This could be dangerous if the wrist is positioned at an angle to the fist. All said, however, this is a great workout if you own a heavy bag. If you are going to make heavy contact in your workouts, I advise looking at another source for proper form.",1469059200,5,1017,4.607734806629834
8523810,4,B0080SFSYM,"Only 4stars because I did not like doing one whole side, then doing the entire routine on other side. I did one dvd 3x a week (m,w,f) completing all 5 dvd in 5weeks. I found them  challenging in that she incorporates moves other than bag work. After 5 weeks I found any other cardiovascular much easier. Another plus. I did these dvds with my fit bit and completed over 8,000 steps with just this workout.",1464480000,3,405,4.4
8523811,5,B0080SFSYM,"I used to pay for a kickboxing gym membership.  Trying to save money I bought a bag for home use, but wasn't enjoying it as much.  I guess it just helps me to have someone motivating me/ telling me what to do and when. These DVDs work great for allowing me to still get the same effectiveness from my workouts at home as I used to get at the gym.",1460505600,5,346,3.9285714285714284
