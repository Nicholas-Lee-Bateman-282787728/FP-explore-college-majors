2466344,1,B000CNESTO,This product wasn't as detailed as I thought it would be.  It doesn't include what I consider the best of Martha's wedding ideas.  I was disappointed.,1223337600,,150,4.730769230769231
2466345,5,B000CNESTO,"Each DVD has great ideas for any type of wedding.  If you have a creative mind and can find a way to make Martha's ideas work for you, then it's a great buy.",1183680000,2,157,3.757575757575758
2466346,3,B000CNESTO,"the set consists of 4 dvds exploring different topics as desribed in the product desription. if you're looking for dull endless segments showing you how to make your own bouquets, etc. then you found the dvd for you. i thought it was like a group of segments showing finished products in different categories like romantic looks, bohemian lookes, day/night looks for cakes, flowers, decor, table settings. i was wrong. it was a tutorial on how to make these things. its basicaly a collection of all her martha stewart living episodes on weddings.",1178496000,5,546,4.945652173913044
2466347,5,B000CNESTO,These DVDs have lots of information. I've already watched them few times. I enjoyed seeing new ideas.,1178496000,,101,5.0
2466348,5,B000CNESTO,"This 4 disc set is full of wonderful and interesting material for anyone planning a wedding or even a lavish party.  Basically a compendium of all the best things from years past it is endlessly watchable.  The cake section is full of inspirational ideas to get everyone out of that ""boring and stale white wedding cake zone."" Though I can not imagine someone even beginning to try these projects in the average home kitchen, better leave it to the professionals.

The only criticism is that some of the segments are too basic.  The basic silhouettes of gowns explained three times....but these dull segments are far and few between and easy enough to fast forward through.

These great dvd's can be watched by anyone interested in Martha Stewart.",1176854400,4,747,4.850393700787402
2466349,5,B000CNESTO,"I love this product. So many ideas, so many pictures, such great film quality. If you're planning an wedding, know someone who is or you just plain love weddings buy this.",1174089600,2,171,4.548387096774194
2466350,5,B000CNESTO,"I like a lot this DVD because as wedding planner, I need to be updated in different details of a wedding. You can see a lot of examples for each aspect of the reception. Useful for brides and wedding planners.",1168387200,3,209,4.25
2466351,5,B000CNESTO,"Martha Stewart has done it again and we truly appreciate what she has given to the industry with her new Collection of DVDs titled Martha's Complete Weddings.

As the founder of Lovegevity and Executive Director for The Wedding Planning Institute I am constantly looking for new books and information to refer to our instructors and students studying to be Certified Wedding Planners.  This is a wonderful reference/resource of wedding ideas that professional planners will not want to be without.

This collection includes just about every wedding episode of Martha Stewart's TV Show over the past 12 years.  It includes easy to follow demonstrations, tips, techniques and even printable templates for both brides-to-be and the professional planners that help a bride pull it all together.

Don't miss out on this must have addition to your library of wedding ideas and resources.",1141084800,11,881,5.264285714285714
2466352,5,B000CNESTO,"The producers of Martha Stewart Television are brilliant.  The content is amazing.  The direction fantastic.  And the programming content unsurpassed.

THIS wedding DVD COLLECTION is worth every penny.",1141084800,8,201,6.071428571428571
2466353,5,B000CNESTO,"Incredible.....do they have 10 stars?? As usual, I bow and pay homage to Martha. Am I a Martha-head? You bet! Will this be an objective review? You bet! Why? Because you can't deny visual proof of what this woman can offer.

This 4-disc offering of wedding planning is so complete that you would be hard-pressed to find any detail missing if this were the only reference tool you had. The discs come beautifully packaged in a fold-out jacket, contained within the outside box. The paper inserts show the subject of each disc, and as always, with the gorgeous photography that is the quality stamp of any Martha product. The DVD quality itself is perfect, in the truest sense of the word, because the images are crystal clear and sharp, with the colors as pristine as digitally possible. And with all the printable material available for you to download, you have more tools to use in planning that very special party, or any party, that you dream of. She also gives detailed instruction as she goes along, so notetaking will be a breeze.

Being a wannabe-chef/baker at heart, I went to the ""Cake Ideas"" disc first. I really enjoy making party cakes, so I was very much anticipating what she would be teaching us regarding this area of baking. Without a doubt, this disc alone was worth the price because it is THE training/reference tool for making ANY cake, let alone a wedding cake. I went through the entire disc (and these are all deliciously long discs) and I felt like the proverbial kid in the candy shop............what project will I tackle first?

To be honest, several of the ideas and things you will see in here can have a price tag that is extravagant to say the least, therefore they might be out of many a couples budgets. But they are interesting and fun to watch, and if you really want them, with a little creativeness, you can alter them to fit into your dream wedding budget.
