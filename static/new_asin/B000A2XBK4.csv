8073297,3,B000A2XBK4,"The 10 movie titles in this set: Strange Illusion, Impact, The Scar, Inner Sanctum, D.O.A., Detour, Kansas City Confidential, Quicksand, Too Late for Tears, The Hitchhiker.  The quality of a couple of discs I watched were watchable. I've recorded direct from Turner Classic Movies and achieved the same quality. I would buy a used set and not have but $11-15 in it delivered.( Which I did) 10 decent film noir flicks for the price of a 12-pack. I'll keep my set. Great for the ""duck club"".",1410307200,,489,4.686046511627907
