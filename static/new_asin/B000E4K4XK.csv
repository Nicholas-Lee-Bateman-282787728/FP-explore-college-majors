8105717,1,B000E4K4XK,"I bought this thinking that it would be the full documentary shown over 2 hours on the UK discovery channel.
Wrong. It's a poor US edit covering a little of the construction of the 2 machines, but mainly the two X prize flights, or rather the backslapping hoopla following them.
A pale shadow of the original broadcast which does scant justice to the amazing achievement by Burt and his team, and especially Mike Melville and Pete Siebold in piloting the early, hairy test flights.
A huge disappointment.",1396915200,4,504,4.804597701149425
8105718,5,B000E4K4XK,"See first hand the magic of Burt Rutan's leadership and inspiration which propels his team to 10 million dollar Ansari X-Prize for the first commercial craft to reach the 328,000 foot mark twice. See first hand the trials and tribulations of one of Mr. Rutan's most challenging projects. This is an exciting video that you will watch again and again. Hats off to Virgin Galactic for achieving this important milestone in commercial space travel; and hats off to the documentary team for their excellent rendition of history being made.

A must have for Burt Rutan Fans!",1321228800,,569,4.927083333333333
8105719,3,B000E4K4XK,I got what I ordered but I ordered the wrong dvd. I was looking for the one that showed the the entire making of the ship. My fault. The dvd I got was in new condition and arrived as promised.,1285286400,,192,3.825
8105720,5,B000E4K4XK,"This Discovery Channel program about the race for the X-Prize is inspirational and educational. If you like shows about space and the space program, you'll like this a lot.",1265500800,,172,4.9655172413793105
8105721,2,B000E4K4XK,"The content was severely lacking.  I learned nothing by watching this video.  No talk about design decisions, spacecraft features, technical challenges.  It is the result of Discovery dumbing down their content.  This DVD is very short, only 43 minutes.  Look for the 150 minute version called ""Black Sky: The Race For Space.""  I bought this short version by mistake.",1190678400,3,367,5.135593220338983
8105722,2,B000E4K4XK,"I am comparing this DVD to the original Discovery TV broadcast. This DVD has 43 minutes of material compared to the OB of what I remember 2x as much. The OB had memorable scenes that's NOT on this DVD.

1 - A scene when Rutan was shopping for a propulsion vendor and calls this guy and got voice mail and left a msg. The vendor later that day listened to VM and and go ""Burt Rutan, ""the"" Burt Rutan??!!!, that's like getting a call from Thomas Edison..."" - priceless scene.

2 - Burt when he was working on the problem of re-entry. He had to devise a way for a soft re-entry. You can see him bulding different models and threw them from a Mohave airport's tower. U can see clearly why his design (feather re-entry) works.

3 - His vision for future space tourism for civilians. Spoken like a visionary for real neat things that can happend in the near-mid future.

4 - His lead aerodynamic engineer going (paraphrasing) ""I am just a college kid, I would never be allowed to do this at Boing, and here I am, building a spaceship."" - Gives hopes for the rest of us!

And others scene I don't recall at the moment. Too bad I erased my recording! <dang>  If u can find one, get it.  This DVD, they cut too much stuff, too dry.",1187827200,7,1222,4.218884120171674
8105723,5,B000E4K4XK,An excellent DVD with good quality. It tells the story very well and is an excellent look behind the scenes of a very historic moment.,1185494400,,134,4.4
8105724,5,B000E4K4XK,"This is an excellent documentary of the recent SpaceshipOne program, taking you through the design challenges, building the vehicle, the early test flights and ending with the winning competition flights.  The amount and quality of in-cockpit and external camera flight footage shown is very impressive, way better than what is seen during shutle flights.  Also provides insight into the mind and drive of Burt Rutan, one of the great aerospace minds of all time.",1141344000,5,463,5.243243243243243
