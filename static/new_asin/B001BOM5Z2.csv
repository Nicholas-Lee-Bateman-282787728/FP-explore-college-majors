8283967,5,B001BOM5Z2,"Shari Lewis has done it again with a wonderful video ""One Minute Bedtime Stories"".  As the title suggests, she tells stories in one minute or less with her puppets Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy, and Charlie Horse.

This video is a really great video to watch with your family, or even by yourself, for great quality and wholesome stories told by Shari and her crew.  This was my first Amazon purchase, and it definitely won't be my last.  I love the stories that are on this tape, and it is a shame that it has never seen a DVD release.  There are several on here that I had never heard of before, but I love them just the same now.  Stories like ""Baba Yaga"", ""Sinbad and the Genie"", ""On Naming a Son"", and especially ""Scherazade"" are really great stories to be told to children.  As stated above, this is a five out of five.  Get it for your whole family!!",1313539200,,849,4.29559748427673
