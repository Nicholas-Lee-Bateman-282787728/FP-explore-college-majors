8523035,4,B007XXQF10,Good film by a first time filmmaker on an ultra-low budget.  I had read the book and was excited to see the characters come to life.  Enjoyed!,1496361600,,142,4.222222222222222
8523036,5,B007XXQF10,"I have read all 3 books in The Code series, and was eager to see this movie that is based upon the first book, The Code: Genesis.
It was fun to see the characters from the book brought to life in the film, as well as added scenes to the movie. For all movies that are based on books, I always like the books better (I'm a reader at heart) but this was a good movie to watch that seems topical for the time...Dec. 21 2012 is approaching quickly!",1352505600,,444,4.0
