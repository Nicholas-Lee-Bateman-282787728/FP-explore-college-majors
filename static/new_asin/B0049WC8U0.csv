4295353,5,B0049WC8U0,"This is an ambitious, retro 80's-ish indie Horror comedy, and it totally works. It gets funnier and wackier as the movie goes
on and builds in the most delightful and absurd way. Great monsters, wacky characters all combine for a truly delightful B-movie horror comedy that pokes
fun at itself in the best way. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's right up there with B movie classics like Slithis and C.H.U.D and Tintora, Tiger Shark! Thumbs up!",1333065600,,441,4.815789473684211
4295354,4,B0049WC8U0,"This flick is a C+++ quality movie.  Sure to be a cult favorite in time.  It hold up great and is a good fun time. Has a Mel Brooks meets Orson Welles feel about it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Creature-from-Lake-Michigan/dp/B0049WC8U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Creature from Lake Michigan</a>",1332288000,,343,7.142857142857143
4295355,5,B0049WC8U0,"We made popcorn, grabbed a beer, and popped in the DVD. We laughed ourselves silly. Then the person I watched this with walked off with it to show other people. I ordered a dozen more copies for those hard-to-shop-for people on my Christmas List, and will probably order more to keep as back-up (I-didn't-know-they-were-coming-over-but-here-they-are-and-what-do-I-do-now?!) gifts.",1291593600,3,380,5.927272727272728
4295356,5,B0049WC8U0,"If you love cheesy teen films from the late '80s, this recently surfaced film from Lake Michigan is the way to go!! The red rim glasses on the main heroine are worth the price of admission alone! The opening of 1936 Chicago is filmed in a b/w noirish style that is really sleek cinematography for the this low-to-no-budget film from 1989! The restoration on this is spotless--it does justice to the film stock it was shot on. Interesting commentary by the writer-producer is just as enjoyable and informative as the film itself! The film's unknown cast are witty and sexy! Their over/underacting is part of this flick's charm!! This film is great for film students to study: as what to beware of and expect when making your first feature length film! The decapatation scene is cool and also the creature dance number! It's got a great incidental score also!! Bottom line, a cute, low-budget, resurfaced from obscurity, independent, cheesy teen horror flick from 1989!!",1289260800,,968,4.908536585365853
4295357,5,B0049WC8U0,"You won't find a better film about a mob-robbing, alien-battling, surfer-loving, cuckold-beheading, tapdancing, drunken lake monster than the Creature from Lake Michigan. Your kids will imitate Lars, Warrior from Beyond the Stars, and slap their heads like Singleglam. Plus the commentary track is as interesting as the film, detailing the curse of the Creature, as everything that could go wrong, did.",1288915200,2,402,5.60655737704918
4295358,5,B0049WC8U0,"It has Lars, Warrior from Beyond the Stars. It has a hitman who changes his name from Bandicoot to Singleglam. It has a mob accountant who gets dragged to his drowning shouting, ""I'm not a goody-goody!"" It has 80s big hair, big glasses, big puffy sleeves and big (really big) cell phones. It has a creature being pummelled for failing to tapdance! It even has golfing. It has everything you could want except the budget it needed. But do we hold that against it? NOOOOO!

Bonus: great commentary from the producer on the way everything that could go wrong did go wrong in the making of this 80s homage to schlocky monster movies. If you were ever tempted to make a movie, you should listen to the commentary.

High art it's not, but if your kids don't go around afterward quoting it, ""I am LARS! Warrior (puff puff) from beyond the stars! Prepare to be annihilated!"" then your kids aren't normal. Or too normal.",1288915200,,911,4.548780487804878
8419482,5,B0049WC8U0,"I got this movie for free at a local Con and Jim Hardison (who worked on the film) told me it was one of the worst movies ever made. The first thing I did when I went home was sit down and watch it. I was extremely surprised to see a very enjoyable and hilarious movie, not a single thing in the movie was bad or unenjoyable. Definitely a 10/10.",1515888000,,345,3.942857142857143

8419484,5,B0049WC8U0,"I was in it.. the caddy who says ""just tap it.. just tap it"" and I think the director, cast and crew hit it out of the ball park.. my kids watched this with me, and they were amazed, laughed till they blew milk out of their noses, and still quote it today.  I wish more people were exposed to the campy fun of the tap dancing monster..",1487116800,,335,3.926470588235294

8419487,5,B0049WC8U0,"Cult Classics Beware; there's a new creature in town.  Allow yourself to forget your work deadlines and nagging in-laws to surrender to the madness.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll say it was better than Cats.  Last year I gave this movie as holiday gifts and EVERYONE said they appreciated this over some thoughtless gift card.  You could make a Back to the 80's movie night by throwing in Hot Tub Time Machine and serving Tab, Capri Sun, and Shake-N-Bake.  This movie is meant to be shared.",1383782400,,496,4.6976744186046515

8419491,5,B0049WC8U0,This film has it all. A singing and dancing monster. Totally rad 80's hair and clothes. And a student film that took only a mere 20 years to make (hence the super authentic 80's feel). And a commentary track that is AWESOME. Think Mystery Science Theater 3000.,1334275200,,260,4.553191489361702
