7988520,3,B000092Q4K,"Hey hey Monkees fans, this is my review of the 1996 documentary about how the Monkees became part of Amrican pop culture. Ther are some very serious issues they endured under the Late Don Kirshner. His idea of creative control was mind boggling to say the least. Some amusing stories as told by the Monkees as a special feature on the VHS and DVD are ""The salad story"" They went out to a restauant to eat Davy noticed Micky digging into his salad lik a wild man. Then there's the one where the guys were chased by thousands of screaming fans. The only thing I didn't like about the documentary was Herman's Hermits singer Peter Noone running down the guys. UNACCEPTABLE!",1350086400,2,670,4.545454545454546
7988521,1,B000092Q4K,"It looks like Rhino will never issue the complete unedited (+ bonus features) documentary on DVD.  Too bad, as this heavily edited, under 60 minute version is a *very* poor substitute.

Hope you kept your VHS machine (or taped the documentary when it was originally aired).

The VHS tape is a solid 5-stars and highly recommended.",1287446400,16,330,4.857142857142857
7988522,1,B000092Q4K,This is a very poor visual quality & chopped up bootleg.  How does Amazon get away selling so many bootleg items?,1259884800,21,113,4.380952380952381
7988523,1,B000092Q4K,"Be sure and read the customer reviews on Amazon's other listing for this DVD.  I don't know why Amazon has separated this DVD into two entries, one ""available"" and the other ""unavailable"" other than to fool people like me into buying it without the benefit of customer reviews.  This DVD is an edited version of the Rhino VHS show - which had included bonus footage as compared to the TV show aired in 1997.  It's less than 60 minutes long.",1160524800,69,440,4.475
