8345953,4,B001VC99EY,"Since its inception, one of the main targets of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been the dark, secretive world of organized crime, known variously as the Cosa Nostra, the mafia, or more simply, the mob. Efforts to penetrate and destroy the Mafia have provided some of the most challenging and violent chapters in the illustrious history of the FBI. THE FBI FILES - Mafia Cases brings you into the world of the FBI as it unravels organized crime syndicates, from the streets of New York and Chicago to the bayous of the Mississippi gulf coast. Retired Special Agent and former Director in Charge of the FBI's New York Office James Kallstrom is your host, taking you behind the scenes with re-enactments and interviews with the actual participants and victims.

I like The FBI Files, I think it's a very interesting show. This set is a good idea, putting 4 episodes about a similar subject (Organized Crime) together on 2 discs. Each episode is 50 minutes long. If you buy only DVDs about the Mafia then go ahead, buy this set, all 4 investigations are very interesting. However if, like me, you enjoy watching this show and not only shows about the Mafia, then I suggest to you to keep your money and buy the complete seasons, all 4 seasons of the FBI Files are interesting and showcase a lot of fascinating cases.

DISC 1 ( Episodes from Season 2 )
- The Dixie Mafia: On Mississippi's Gulf Coast, a Judge and his politician wife were brutally murdered in their home, leaving few clues to the identity of the killer. Local police were baffled. Once it was determined that federal laws had been violated, the FBI uncovered a corrupt local government and a group of violent criminal conspirators known as the Dixie Mafia, responsible for fraud, money laundering and murder.
- Master Plan: In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named ""Safebet,"" designed to expose the Chicago Mafia's infiltration into the city's surrounding suburbs. Undercover agents discovered that the mob had its tentacles spread into every facet of the law enforcement community. When a wealthy socialite was murdered by a greedy mob lawyer abetted by a local chief of police, the FBI had the leverage to break the mob's stranglehold on the suburbs.

DISC 2 ( Episodes from Season 1 )
- The Crazy Don: He wandered the streets of New York City wearing only pajamas and a bathrobe, but the FBI was convinced that Vincent Gigante, the reputed boss of the Genovese crime family, was anything but crazy. The FBI used undercover surveillance, secret audio tapes, six mobster turned government informant and the testimony of 12 FBI agents to help convict Gigante of murder and murder conspiracy.
- John Gotti: in 1985, the head of the Gambino crime family was gunned down on the streets of New York. The new don, John Gotti, immediately became the prime suspect but the Teflon Don was always one step ahead of the law, and an elite team of federal agents was formed to bring down the Gambino Family. The mafia code of silence, Omerta, was finally cracked by the FBI when Gotti's under-boss Salvatore (The Bull) Gravano agreed to testify against him, leading to life without parole for the Teflon Don.",1335398400,3,3191,4.7771739130434785
8345954,1,B001VC99EY,Not a very good show these FBI files.  There are lots of video and stills of mobsters and they use actors to re-enact events.  Not worth the money.,1268265600,6,147,4.214285714285714
