8002339,4,B0000JCFOU,"Jessie James meets Frankensteins daughter is in color and is good quality,
the other films are murky transfers. Try MGM release for screaming skull as
the picture quality is much better.",1512777600,,186,5.032258064516129

8002342,3,B0000JCFOU,"Cult Classics, Vol. 2 contains the kind of films that are best viewed on a rainy night. Atmospheric horror classics, Saturday matinee spook fest..Pure fun, more schlock then scares but schlock is what sold in the 60's and even the 70's.",1171411200,,236,4.780487804878049
8002343,1,B0000JCFOU,"Yes indeed, thank you for your caveat Skinnyrobbie, there is something highly suspect about the timing and content of countrygirl958's ""reviews""; even more so when you look at the musings on her ""more about me"" page...reads like a text from Home Shopping Network ... her thoughts on the movie ""Iris"" are a bit of a giveaway ... she sat through a bioflick about Iris Murdoch and still spells that august writer's name wrong? Hmmmmmm....as for the AMC dvd package, there are enough bad copies of ""public domain"" movies around as it is, with scammers ready to retail them. I suggest you track down a genuine fan/archivist (try ebay) who has copies to sell of beloved 50's cult movies, taken from the best available sources, or, yes, give Alpha Video a try (but do be careful of their product, see my notice on ""Screaming Skull"", and I just watched Alpha Video's ""Wasp Woman"", which lived down to their frequently abominable standards.) As for AMC and ""Monsterfest"", well, whatever happened to Amercian Movie Classics channel? A very reliable cable network once upon a time, from which you could tape great copies of good quality prints, especially at Hallowe'en when they ran their Monsterfest ... then the channel went commercial, the dreaded words ""edited for content"" started appearing, and the worst kind of careless commercialism seemed thereafter to dictate their presentation and programming. A great shame indeed, and I'm not a bit surprised there's a surfeit of question marks around running times and print quality on anything AMC markets. Thanks, Skinnyrobbie!!!",1084579200,12,1570,5.089147286821706
8002344,3,B0000JCFOU,"As has been pointed out in previous reviews, the claims made by countrygirl958 are suspect... but NOT when compared to the movie descriptions on the box housing these DVD's... which is almost word-for-word what was written! More unsettling is the fact that we may have been gypped! Timings on these films are not what are advertised. ""Dementia 13"" is 74 min., not 81 as the box claims. ""Frozen Alive"" according to all info I've been able to obtain, should be in the neighborhood of 80 min. A version to soon be released by ""Alpha Video"" claims the film runs 77 min. This AMC box claims 81 min... WRONG AGAIN! The film contained on this DVD runs 63 min!!!!!!!!! Something here isn't right!! The public relations department of Genius Products have been notified regarding this issue.
As the old adage warns........""Let the buyer beware"".",1078704000,13,835,4.846153846153846
8002345,4,B0000JCFOU,"OK really do not know why Skinnyrobbie Wrote such a nasty review about this DVD. I purchased Both Volumes 1 and 2 for very enexpensive.  If you love the Old black and Whites of days Past, You'll love these!!.  Many of the movies Touch on themes we see in Lame versions running on the screens today.  If you are a true classsic Horror fan, These 4 movies offered are rare and hard to find anywhere else and an awsome Deal for the Price!!!!  Definatly Recommended!!!",1078099200,,464,4.423529411764706
8002346,1,B0000JCFOU,"Hmmm...suspicious stuff. The user 'countrygirl958' reviews all four of the sets from this series one day after the release date? That's suspicious enough, but this user is in love with all four sets, choosing to focus only on the story of the films and cheap hyperbole, rather than noting the abominable presentation, murky transfers, misspellings, grammar errors, ill-conceived menu systems, destroyed prints. Surely those reviews were written by an employee of Genius Products, because no human being in their right mind would bestow such praise on these hackneyed sets of public domain films. ""Dementia 13"" is watchable, unlike ""Frozen Alive"" and ""The Screaming Skull"", which are a miserable mess. Finally, ""Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter"" actually contains color! I didn't know it was public domain (and it might not be...), but it's the best looking print in the set. The colors are bright...almost day-glo. The hues are too hot, actually, which can be blinding. But compared to other titles in this 'AMC Monsterfest Collection', it is the holy grail.
My recommendation? Avoid any DVD with AMC, Monsterfest, or Genius Products mentioned anywhere on the packaging. They are scammers and know fully well they are deceiving buyers. Hence some of the misleading rave reviews that are more entertaining than the DVD's themselves.",1067212800,22,1340,5.355450236966824
