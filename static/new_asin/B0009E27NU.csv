8059240,1,B0009E27NU,"I just received this dvd within the last 5 minutes. I was always a huge fan on the band Styx and its lead singer, Dennis De Young. The description of the dvd said the length was 2:05. When I looked the backside of the dvd I find out that it is only 67 minutes. Extremely disappointed that Amazon did not double check the information they provided the Amazon customer with what was actually printed on the backside of the dvd. I watched it once, and then donated it to charity.",1494028800,,476,4.3

8059244,5,B0009E27NU,"If you ever want to see Mr. Roboto performed live again this dvd is the only way to go.  Yes Styx is still rocking today without DDY, but this dvd showcases many Styx hits you will never hear Tommy & JY ever play on stage again.
The sound & production on this DVD is amazing. Dennis DeYoung shows he can indeed still rock, even with a full symphonic orchestra at his side.
Hear Styx hits of yesterday sound even better than they did back in the 80's.",1114560000,2,450,4.172413793103448
