A lifetime family classic. Brings back many many memories. Now please Fern Gully, Little Nemo, Once Upon a Forest, Jetsons the Movie, He-Man, She-Ra, and so much more get released on DVD. Also great great lifetime classics.",993945600,3,440,4.653846153846154
901759,5,6304570112,"Let me say flat-out that my uncle was the Musical Director for this movie.  His name is on the Credits, Dennis Leogrande, as large as a credit can me.  That being said, I have seen this video about a thousand times.  I was  force-fed the video at many family gatherings as well as when it was  released back in 1986.  After a 10 year or more hiatus from viewing this  video, it recently resurfaced while moving videos around in the cabinet.  I  picked it up, and was like, eh...i'm bored.  So i popped it into the VCR  and started to watch.  The quality of the tape was quite bad from sitting  in the cabinet for so long, but i could still see the video loud and clear.  First: the plot.  The story is a bit like fern gully, but in most ways  better.  No, the animation is not as good as ferngully, but it is defintly  more vivid.  Through the simple animation, the story gets across in a much  better way.  It's like he-man or the smurfs.  the story is what counts.  I  heard, though, that the animation was totally re-done for DVD.  But i  digress.  The plot and characters are awesome, the Punk meets Run DMC  Mushroom, the shy painter, and the excessivly hate-able Emperor Spine are  voiced AWESOMELY in the story.  Every bit of the plot fits together, and  characters are well developed.  Will your kids like it?  yea!  even though  there are some scary parts, nothing that kids can't handle (even the little  ones).  It's tense though, at parts, especially in the race against time!  And the message comes out: Good vs Evil, respect the Forest, Animals are  good, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself!  This movie is a can't  miss!  Buy it now!  An instant classic!",966556800,2,1675,4.4072847682119205
901760,5,6304570112,"i saw it as a kid and i've never forgotten it. in fact, i bought it for my 22nd birthday because i still think it is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen and i can't wait to have kids someday so i can show it to  them. i didn't even know there was a book (must look for it now)",959817600,2,289,3.515625

7874792,5,6304570112,"This beautifully animated film has a charming story. It's better suited to children aged 6 and up, only because the evil character and his minions can be a little scary. The humor and happy ending make it an endearing story.",1395014400,,224,4.625
7874793,5,6304570112,Loved this DVD movie.... bought back memories of my childhood. And allowed me to reminisce with my family. Just as good this time as all those years ago,1363132800,,152,4.464285714285714
7874794,3,6304570112,"This was one of the movies I vaguely remembered from when I was growing up and over the years I've been trying to remember this movie let alone the name of it.  When I done a search for it and found it, I went about watching it and seems like it's like that I remember from what very little I remember from when I watched this movie when I was either like 4 - 6 years old.  For those who don't know or might not remember, it's about this painter who took a break under a elm tree, and while he took a nap when he woke he had magical powers with his brush along with being able to understand the animals.  Thus getting these powers is to try to stop the 'Cactus King' from making the forest a horrible place.  The animation for the movie is dated, but at the time it was maybe decent to good at most, and the writing seemed decent enough though at the time I didn't know what all that meant.  For the most part it, I'm not sure how well it aged over time.  Overall, I give Elm Chanted Forest 3 stars out of 5.",1300924800,,1008,3.9653465346534653
7874795,3,6304570112,"I loved this movie as a child and was so excited to find it on amazon. Though it was fairly expensive for a (used) VHS, I went ahead and purchased it for about $13. The quality of the video is sub-par and I've only watched it once in about 3 years. I probably wouldn't recommend it.",1267142400,,282,4.053571428571429
