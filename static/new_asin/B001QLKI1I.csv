8336070,5,B001QLKI1I,Especially the Amy Neil story which was amazing and educational and should be required viewing in high school 'health' classes.,1322352000,,127,5.4
8336071,5,B001QLKI1I,"This collection of lesbian shorts is varied in quality but worth the purchase price because of Amy Neil's autobiographical ""Just Me.""  The 22-minute film is a skillfully woven and professionally done tale of one woman's quest to discover whether or not she was/is the only lesbian in her family. Although the Real Truth died with her great grandmother, there is a lot of evidence that is revealed through her courageous and thorough research. It's a must see!",1238803200,2,459,4.961038961038961
8336072,5,B001QLKI1I,"This is a wonderful film, it's so funny and touching. It's such a lovely story of finding belongingness (is that a word? I'll ask Stephen Colbert!). Okay, I guess the real term would be a sense of belonging.

No matter who you are, you can relate to that desire to discover a special connection to the people in your life.... what a wonderful gift. I hope that everyone has the opportunity to see this film. It's really very special. You should especially try to see it at a film festival where you can see it with a large audience. I saw it at the San Francisco Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and the audience was so responsive. It should win every film festival.",1238284800,,661,4.373983739837398
