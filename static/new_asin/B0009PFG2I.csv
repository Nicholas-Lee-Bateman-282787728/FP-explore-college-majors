A woman warns children: beware of false prophets. Children playing see a body in a barn. A man in an open top car drives down a road. [A rear projection screen.] He attends a theater, but is caught for being a car thief. Elsewhere a man brings money to his son, the police are after him! Ben Harper will be hanged for a double murder. [This is set in the Great Depression of the 1930s.] Ben never talked. A prison guard looks after his family. His children are teased at school. We see a steam locomotive. A stranger is in town, he lives in the boarding house. Harry Powell tells a story about Hate and Love. He was a friend to Ben, he says. There is a picnic, Harry pumps Mrs. Harper for information. Powell tells John about the marriage. Will Pearl spill the beans? Harry talks to his wife about personal matters.

Pearl cuts up pieces of paper, she doesnt know what it is. Willow made a mistake in a hasty marriage to a stranger. Then we learn that Willow has run away with a traveling salesman! [Who will repot this to the police?] Powell has a good story for her disappearance. Will Uncle Bertie tell what he saw? Harry questions Pearl and John about that money. John says its in the cellar under a stone. But Pearl tells where it is! They run out of the house and go to Uncle Bertie. Hes no help. The children leave in a boat and paddle down river. They seek shelter in a cow barn for the night. [No dogs to warn against strangers?] Powell is on their trail. [Those backgrounds seel like a back lot.] They find a home with Miss Cooper. The Bible provides low-cost entertainment for her children. The Preacher finds Ruby and treats her to ice cream while he asks questions.

Ruby tells Miss Cooper about this. Powell shows up to ask about John and Pearl. He aint my Dad. A good woman with a gun stops a bad guy. Harry returns after dark and sings. A shot drives him off. Then Miss Cooper calls the police. Powell is arrested for the murder of Willow. John hits Harry with the doll, money falls out. There is a crowd yelling for punishment of this Bluebeard. The police take this man out the back way to prison. Miss Cooper and the children celebrate Christmas. Johns present is a watch.

Was this meant as a horror film? A warning against strangers who put on an act to impress the people they meet? This isn't much of a story, parts seem implausible except as needed for this story. Beware of friendly strangers who try to sell you something is still good advice. Just watch the advertising on TV for examples. Trust no one. Would people, then or now, be fooled by a stranger who said he was a preacher? Their own local preacher would quickly spot a phony [IMO].",1413417600,,2704,4.348514851485149
8064944,5,B0009PFG2I,"Harry Powell (Mitchum) is a preacher with severe mental issues. The man talks to himself, has the words ""love"" and ""hate"" tattooed on his fingers, and is obsessed with ""vain women"" who lure men to sin with lust. It's Powell's ""mission"" then to destroy these women with his switchblade.

Powell is arrested in a stolen Model T while leaving the scene of his latest carnage. In jail, he meets a condemned man named Harper (Graves) and learns that his cellmate has a pilfered $10,000 stashed away, but is unable to find out where he's hidden it. Once released, the preacher locates Harper's wife and begins courting her, hoping she'll lead him to the loot. When physical attraction occurs between the two, the demented reverend returns to his primary mission: to rid the Earth of wicked females!

(8.2) The Night of the Hunter (1955) - Robert Mitchum/Shelley Winters/Lillian Gish/James Gleason/Peter Graves/Billy Chapin (uncredited: John Hamilton/Michael Chapin)

CAST TRIVIANA--

The only picture directed by Charles Laughton, who purportedly rewrote the entire James Agee script. This story was proved false in 2004, when Agee's first draft for the movie was discovered and found to be identical to the finished work.

Kids annoyed Laughton, so Robert Mitchum directed several scenes involving children.

Although widely considered a classic now, on first release, ""Hunter"" did poorly at the box office.

Billy Chapin (John Harper) is brother of Lauren (""Kitten"" on TV's ""Father Knows Best""). Their brother Michael is uncredited here as Ruby's boyfriend.

Gary Cooper refused the role of Harry Powell, thinking it might ruin his career if he played the crazed holy man. Robert Mitchum lobbied for the part and got it.

Mitchum hated working with Shelley Winters.

Lillian Gish (Rachel Cooper) was cast because Laughton admired her work.

James Gleason (Birdie Steptoe), who played Lt. Rooney in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944) and was ""Gillis"" in the film version of ""The Life of Riley"" (1949), fought in the Spanish-American War of 1898.

John Hamilton (uncredited townsman who greets Rachel) had a long screen career but is best remembered by modern audiences as Perry White on TV's ""The Adventures of Superman.""",1225152000,,2869,5.9440389294403895
