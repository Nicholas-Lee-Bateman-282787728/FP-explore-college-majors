7179815,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Excellent,Excellent movie for the whole family!! One of the best movies this year. A little violence but that seen by children everyday in animated movies etc.",1436918400,6,159,5.153846153846154
7179816,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"This movie is very emotionally powerful.  A boy named ""Pepper"" who hormonally can't grow taller is somewhat of a social outcast, in WWII-era ""O'Hare"", California, a fictional coastal town (filmed in Tijuana and Baja).  He starts getting interested in magic shows and is guided by a Catholic priest played by Tom Wilkinson to channel his interest in the supernatural into a faith journey.  His dad has to go off to war, and Pepper struggles to know what it means to have faith in God, taking Jesus' statements literally about getting whatever you want if you have faith.  (Jesus' statements were probably specifically referring to spiritual gifts for ministering to others.)  The priest gives him a list which Pepper initially thinks is a checklist of all the good deeds he has to do to win God's favor, but which is actually the priest's way of trying to get him occupied on noble pursuits and less worried about his dad.  The hardest challenge for Pepper is learning to be genuinely kind to a Japanese man in the town, who is mostly a loner and initially views Pepper as an inconvenience.  The Japanese man does not believe in a Higher Power and is concerned the priest is just setting Pepper up for more disappointment by giving him a checklist to accomplish to please God.  However, all along, it's clear to someone watching the movie that the priest knows best, and that he's trying to develop character in Pepper so that Pepper will see there are more important things than getting God to give him a specific request.  When the Japanese man's safety is put in danger because of Pepper's older brother, who is fanatically anti-Jap like the American media was teaching people to be (in which sense the Americans were as wrong in their racial profiling as the Nazis were), the movie becomes very emotionally intense.  When the Japanese man is in danger, the movie starts taking you on a deeper journey of maturity with the characters.

The movie is structured like a series of episodes which incorporate abstract themes which we all wonder about:  1) Is righteousness just a list?  2) Is it just for the purpose of getting what I want from God?  3) Can I guarantee an outcome from God?  4) Should I INTERPRET every outcome (or even ANY outcome, for the Japanese agnostic character) as from God?  Its a movie in which you feel yourself grow up in the process of watching it.  It also is heartwarming even if the journey is sometimes heart-wrenching.  There is a lot of unpredictability about how things will turn out, and it feels painfully close to real life sometimes because of this uneasy combination of normal life with unexpected crises (which may be in the news or with personal relationships).  It's really an interesting exploration of how we view God and whether there are any guarantees in life.  Yet it also has entertainment value, not so much in a feel-good way but more like dramas such as Forrest Gump and War Horse, which affirm the value of life in the context of enduring losses and facing struggles.  This is a serious drama but one which left me uplifted rather than drained by the end.",1436313600,46,3108,4.707948243992607
7179817,5,B00XQ2CC6O,Excellent! One of the best movies I have seen in sometime.,1434153600,8,58,4.363636363636363

7179819,5,B00XQ2CC6O,Easily the very BEST faith based movie of 2015.  This movie will rip your heart out of your chest and grow it 2x times size before putting it back to do with what you will.,1433462400,54,172,3.914285714285714

7179821,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"The film centers around Pepper Flynt  Busbee (Jakob Salvati) growing up in O'Hare California during the war era. Pepper is short and gets the nickname ""Little Boy"" replacing ""midget.""  When his brother London (David Henrie) was rejected for service, dad (Michael Rapaport) who is Pepper's only friend, goes instead. When loyal Japanese are released from internment, Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) shows up in town befriended by a local priest (Tom Wilkinson). Dad is believed to be either dead or a POW in Japan. Pepper displays his disdain for ""the Jap"" in front of Father Oliver who tailors him a personal penance of good deeds. One of his deeds is to make friends with Hashimoto, the ""face of the enemy.""

As far as swearing and sex etc, the film is suitable for children. It deals with the harsh realities of prejudice and has off screen violence, i.e. it shows someone kicking a person, but not the actual kicks. Kevin James has a small role of Dr. Fox an ally of the family who has designs for Mrs. Busbee (Emily Watson). The film invokes emotions. It looks at faith vs the secular world and sees co-existence.",1432598400,142,1118,4.782383419689119

7180030,1,B00XQ2CC6O,"I borrowed this wording from a site called ""Movie Guide"" because I totally agree with it.  ""Mixed pagan worldview with strong, overt Christian, redemptive elements, but diminished by magical thinking, which is refuted several times but still becomes a powerful plot motivator,""

This movie sort of disguises itself as a Christian movie, but is really about magical thinking.  Didn't appreciate the deception.  It does show a wholesome family view, and also has a convincing view of the prejudice and animosity against that Japanese during WWII (though some of this wasn't really prejudice, but fear because of the attack on Perl Harbor and the fact that we were at war with the Japanese whose leadership deceived us).  The movie becomes very strange in its coverage of the atom bombing of Hiroshima, though shows the devastation very well.  Nevertheless, the movie doesn't seem to know where to go a lot of times, at least in my mind.",1493510400,,934,4.993548387096774

7180177,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"A story about a boy doing everything that he could to keep his hopes alive that his dad was coming back home. While it did show how a little kid's mind can be shaped by anyone, be it good or evil, it did a better job at capturing the hatred of Japanese people during the war with the Japanese of Pearl harbor. It shows how fear can make even an innocent little boy very aggressive. I first assumed that this movie would be nothing more than religious propaganda but it really wasn't. Anyone of any religion or even someone without a religion can relate to the little boy at some point in their life.",1479254400,,599,4.2631578947368425

7180420,4,B00XQ2CC6O,"This was a sweet, heartwarming movie. It focuses on Pepper Busbee, a young boy growing up in O'Hare, California, during World War II. Pepper is small for his age and the bullies call him 'Little Boy.' He has no friends and relies on his father as his best friend. Unfortunately, his father goes off to war after Pepper's older brother, London, fails to qualify for service.

Pepper is desperate for his father's return. Upon advice from the local priest, he sets about performing performing a series of acts to prove his faith. He hopes God will reward him with a miracle. Among this acts is establishing a friendship with a Japanese man, Mr. Hashimoto.

There are some scenes in the movie that require the audience to suspend disbelief--such as one depicting a fortunately timed earthquake. It requires the same sort of acceptance by the audience as does Forrest Gump.

The movie is well-acted and well-produced. Jakob Salvati is adorable and lovable as little Pepper Busbee. There were some very sweet moments and some humorous ones as well. The movie gave me a sense of nostalgia for a time that came and went before I was born. There also were dark scenes, though, which showed the prejudices of the time and the cruelties that children can inflict upon one another.

Near the end of the movie came a scene I found horribly jarring and deeply unsettling. The film seemed to be making light of a tragic historical event and I found this incongruous, given the mature treatment of other subjects. Pepper's lack of compassion could be understood to be attributable to his young age, but I would have liked to have the adult Pepper address this in the narration, to provide a deeper context for what the film depicted. As it was, it seemed to betray all Pepper was supposed to have learned from befriending Hashimoto.

Aside from that one misstep, the film was very good.",1466208000,,1871,4.7446153846153845
7180461,4,B00XQ2CC6O,"Some critics call it misguided & ""offensive.""  Of all things to be offended by in the world this is not one. I say grow up!  Yes, there are negative attitudes/attributes in the film, but they are shown to be misguided, wrong-headed.  They are also a part of history and we need to face history as it was, not as how we think it should have been.

At its core, LITTLE BOY is extremely well-meaning and very sincere.  It is also pleasantly devoid of exploitation, be it language or otherwise.  Young Jakob Salvati gives a touching performance and the rest of the cast (which includes at least one Oscar winner in Tom Wilkinson) is solid as well.  Alejandro Monteverde's direction is caring and affecting.  I also found the score and most of the cinematography (save for some wartime footage that felt a little too crisp, to produced, if you will) well suited to the film.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Boy/dp/B0142KGGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Boy</a>",1466121600,7,1005,5.3164556962025316

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

7180612,1,B00XQ2CC6O,"How did anyone like this movie?!  What on Earth is supposed to make me feel good about this supposedly ""feel good"" movie?  The priest can't just come out and say, ""If you want your father back, the best thing you can do is get going praying your Rosary.  And be nice to the Japanese guy in town because that's the decent thing to do.""  Instead he gives some completely non-understandable advice that leaves the boy trying some weird kind of magic to bring his father back, and no one ever corrects the child.  Not only do they not correct him, the boy ends up thinking that the magic really did accomplish something - something, I might add, that no child should ever want to be responsible for.

What is with the side story about the mother and the town doctor?  Creepy!  Emily Watson's strength is in playing the role of a strong, intelligent woman.  As another reviewer pointed out, her character was clueless in this film.  I found her character completely unlikable.  I was amazed that this movie had glowing reviews on IMDB.  I can't believe it is showing up as a five star movie on Amazon.  I'm one of those people who wants to support efforts to produce great family movies, but this movie isn't great.

The human frailty and other earthly traits are not abandoned in the characters which makes them appear all the more authentic while inspiring the viewer all the while to a more supernatural element which is both in the background and foreground of the plot. It finally crescendos with the beatitudinal list no longer a means to an end, but an ends unto itself.  A must have for one's library of inspirational material!",1455408000,,582,4.752475247524752

With the help of his priest and an old Japanese man, he's able to turn his hate into love and change the world around him. It's touching and old fashioned. There is no sex or nudity. There is some fighting, but not a lot of blood spatter. There might be a swear word or two, but nothing to get excited about.

This film does not dictate dogma on you, it just affirms the power of such no matter what you call it. This is what makes it such a powerful, wide-reaching film.

7181152,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Little Boy is an extraordinary story of bravery, courage and the simple lesson of doing the right thing. Through many events, these key lessons are shown. The movie Little Boy takes place during World War Two on the coast of California. The main character, Pepper, is small for his age and often bullied and picked on because of it. His best and only friend is his father. But when the man he calls partner is drafted to fight for his country in the Philippines, Pepper has no one to protect him. With the war escalating, his brother, London, struggles to keep the family business afloat. With many family hardships, the last thing they need to hear is that James, Little Boys father, is missing in action. But when James does go MIA, as a POW, Pepper will do anything to bring him home.
Pepper, Jakob Salvati, is continuously bullied throughout the story, given the name Little Boy by the town for his height. His family gets worse everyday. His mother, played by Emily Watson, is always depressed. London, played by David Henrie, is an extremely unreliable brother to Pepper. London blames himself for his father going to war, he couldn't be drafted because of his flag feet, and resorts to alcohol to solve his problems. But, the story really kicks off when a Japanese - American, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, moves to the town.
 After being released from the camps, the whole town hates him, especially the families with loved ones in the war. London has extreme hatred for Hashimoto. Usually far from sober, London gets in plenty of trouble with the law for expressing his hatred. Soon enough, London winds up in jail. After the family of two loses the only man of the house, they become as troubled as ever.
Through this, Little Boy looks even father for hope. After hearing a sermon in church of moving a mountain with a mustard seed, hes determined to find these powers. The way to be more powerful is to increase your faith, the father tells him. Giving him a list of things to do to increase his faith, the very last one written is befriend Hashimoto. Believing that by doing this list he can bring his father back, Pepper accepts the challenge, willing to do anything to bring Dad back.
Through a very rocky start, Pepper apologizes to The Jap, an extremely courageous act on Peppers part. Only the priest will befriend him, but Pepper steps up to the plate because he knows it's right thing to do and it's what he has to do. Throughout spending time together, Hashimoto becomes Peppers friend, almost a father figure to him. Over the story, the older man gives many words of wisdom to Little Boy, giving him the strength to fight the bullies and overcome many problems. Through the story, Pepper achieves the respect he has longed for. Even when times become troubled, like when Hashimoto ends up in the hospital beaten half to death, or when his father is MIA, Pepper stays strong in his faith.
I really enjoyed this movie for many reasons. It's under the category of fiction/ fantasy, because of the powers, or actions of Pepper. But, the fictional act of Pepper moving a mountain and causing Little Boy are both linked through real events. Like how most things were based on real events, like the atomic bomb, the Japanese in camps, how the Americans treated the japanese, etc. These connections can help you relate to the story because they're historical events, which really backed up the story. Alejandro Gmez Monteverde, director and co- writer of Little Boy, is a fairly new and inexperienced director. There were a few flaws in the movie, or in the plot, that seemed to be lacking. For example, the story takes place in OHare, California, a fictional town that doesn't add to the plot. Also, Peppers age is never mentioned. I don't see a point to this, adding it would help the audience relate better.
What was really great about the movie was all of the lessons that were shown through Peppers many traits.  For example, befriending The Jap took a ton of courage and kindness, Pepper was hated by many for doing what he decided to do. Completing the many tasks that the priest asked of him, growing faith, gave us an image of how much love this Little Boy has for his father and how strong of a character this tiny boy is. He wasn't going to give up for anything. Watching Pepper transform from a bullied child to a boy with plenty of confidence, defeating bullies, was something I really enjoyed. It reveals many challenges that we can all connect to in real life. Pepper shows us how to get around many obstacles and how to face our problems. This movie is a 10/10 and I would recommend it to anyone.",1450742400,,4617,4.6292682926829265

7181158,1,B00XQ2CC6O,"This movie doe not have an honest bone in it's metaphorical body.  The idiocies of its plot and presentation are too numerous to detail but here are a few examples. It presents a muddled morality that tries to be both pro and anti Christian, takes a post-modern view of World War Two, clearly implies that Japanese culture (the one that was raping and pillaging its way across Asia) is superior to Western and finally has the most egrigious case of ""Disney death"" that I can rememberer.  It also wastes the talented Emily Watson in a thankless role as the clueless mom.  As another reviewer pointed out, this movie presents a town in which five or six larger boys are free to bully and harass a smaller boy on a public street in front of large numbers of adults .  Oh, and it also suggests that because US forces attacked Japan that made it OK for the Japanese to kill POWs.",1449792000,8,874,4.44375

We all need to learn how to stop judging others because of the color of their skin, the sound of their voice or what perhaps others of their culture have done.

None of these themes were thrown in your face but all of them were there.  Excellently put together; I recommend this move for all persons who are 10 years and older.

7181323,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"We watched ""Little Boy"" last night.  I didn't know what to expect.  I was bowled over by the film's sweetness and ""Little Boy's"" strength of character and his unshakable love for his father.  A lovely relationship.  I was reading some reviews which thought the film was horribly manipulative.  Personally, I don't mind being manipulated if I'm enjoying the story and performances.  Jacob Salvati as Pepper or Little Boy is an absolute marvel.  He doesn't so much carry the movie as appear in most all of it, a young boy who comes across as so believable, with such strength of character for one so young.  It's a marvel of a performance.  It's fun to see who else is in the film, some not quite recognizable, others definitely so, but all adding to a viewer's enjoyment of what they call a ""faith-based"" film.  Aside from that, the story reflects the power of believing and loving. Unless you're a cynic, I think the film will have great appeal.  It's a wonderful way to spend just short of two hours of viewing time.",1446854400,,1017,4.625698324022347

There is a religious tone to the movie, but not so overt that non-religious viewers should be bothered.  Without ruining the movie for you, the movie is set in the 1940's during WW2.  The costumes, acting and story line were phenomenal.  There are some scenes that are deeply touching and found myself fighting off a tear or two.  I wish I could say more, but don't want to ruin the movie for you!  Lastly, I am a big sci-fi/action movie fan, so it is very rare I rate a drama this high.",1446422400,,609,4.2894736842105265

Has some similarities to ""A Christmas Story"" in style, and ""Lifted"" from 2011, in theme, the latter being even better in my humble opinion, but this
was a very satisfying and emotionally powerful film on the effect of war and bullying on an 8 year old boy whose father is fighting oversees.

fighting for its  survival that todays writers have no idea what they are trying to twist and make us as Americans feel guilty. Even at the end when
the boys dad returned they left him disabled with a bleak future. Japan is now our friend and ally, they have excepted the terrible and ex-
treme terror they put on all the world during that war. Unlike so many other groups, they have moved on and become a strong and great people.

We're all about family-friendly and inspirational movies like Dreamer, Million Dollar Arm, the original Karate Kid, Remember the Titans or a couple dozen others.  This is to those what the worst B-movies are to the Matrix.  This movie suffered from insufficient character development and characters that were developed were not likable.  The kid's brother does nothing to protect him from bullies?  The kid's mom has his bully's dad (the town doc) over for dinner?  The town just goes about their business while a very small kid is getting beat up by five or six older bullies?  Then after the kid's brother participates in a late night home invasion of the Mr. Miagia guy, we're supposed to like him later after the dad returns and ""Little Boy's"" wish comes true?

7181835,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Little Boy is one of those types of movies that has such a unique feel to it, it is hard to classify.  Some will call this a faith based film and I guess to a point it is that with its message but it is not to me typical of that genre of films.  I personally am not one to like those faith message type films as they tend to be a bit overboard with their message but in this case, I really liked this movie.  In a way this movie reminded me in its film style of one of my favorite movies from several years ago called My Dog Skip.  The story is different of course but has a similar film style and feel with a great kid actor and a heartfelt story.  Salvati is excellent in the role and for his age plays his emotions very well.  The story itself starts a bit slow to me and has a bit of quirkiness to it at times but once the story moves along a bit, especially when the boys quest to complete the list begins, the story picks up and really got my interest.  This is a story that really pulls at the heartstrings and has a sweet emotional ending.  Call this type of film what you want, but this is a sweet film about a boy and his belief that he can bring his father home that is a good story and an entertaining movie.  You don't have to like this genre of movie to enjoy this one.

7181837,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Sweet production.  Jakob Salvati is such a cute little actor.  The movie has some predictability but Emily Watson, does a great job as the mother.  I read a review that Kevin James was a horrible character, but I didn't find him so.  He was just a lonely man who wanted some happiness in his life.  I especially like the corporal acts of mercy which is the catalyst for Little Boy's tasks.  Not preachy, the point still gets across that faith can move mountains.

I can relate to his knitting experience.",1442620800,,504,4.533333333333333

It took me about half way through to figure out that this movie is simply a story told from the perspective of a little boy. So there is some quirkiness in the movie, almost like the movie ""A Christmas Story"". Once I figured that out, I thought it was quite clever. I'm not sure why, but the trailers for the film really don't represent the content of the movie. The content of the story was completely different than what I was expecting.

Nothing is ""sugar-coated"" in this film.  Life was hard during this time period, as was realistic; prejudice occurred and good people made mistakes based on emotions rather than rational thinking.  Faith in a higher power are explored, and regardless of your personal beliefs, you can choose for yourself if events that occur are acts of God, consequences or just dumb luck. It is quite clear, however, which of these the ""little boy"" chooses to believe by the conclusion of the movie.

There are a few scenes that might be disturbing to very young viewers, (scenes of war, bullying, and an attack on an innocent man), so please keep that in mind. It DOES get rather suspenseful and emotional. But still, if you're okay with it, than this film is a must-see! It is not a ""Christian"" movie, per se. So if you're not of the faith, it really shouldn't offend. However, faith doesn't have to be of a certain religion. Faith CAN be religion-based, but it can also mean having faith in oneself.

7182688,2,B00XQ2CC6O,"Meh.... unmoving acting performances, overly contrived story and production, and as another reviewer said, styled like the movie War Horse - hokey and old fashioned.  It felt like a sappy Disney family film from the 60's.  If you go for that sort of thing then you might like it.  No one I saw the film with liked it either.",1439856000,2,324,4.4576271186440675

7182708,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"I loved this movie and have seen it 3x.  Beautiful film making. Little Boy parallels to the atomic bomb are fantastic and add depth to the story.
Jakob Salvati is definitely the star of this movie - his facial expressions and body language are superb and authentic. A real child star. Costuming  captures the style of the times in the best way possible. Just look at that hat!",1439596800,2,376,4.514705882352941
7182709,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"The movie is excellent, highly, highly recommend it.  There will not be a dry eye in the house.

** Only problem, the screen kept shifting, I'm not sure where the fault of that lies, with Amazon or the movie.",1439424000,3,208,4.3076923076923075
7182710,5,B00XQ2CC6O,I wish I could give it 10 stars it deserves it and wow that young boy is an amazing actor,1439424000,6,89,3.5
7182711,5,B00XQ2CC6O,Perfect in every way. The way movies should be made.,1439337600,2,52,4.3
7182712,5,B00XQ2CC6O,One of the best movies I've seen in years. Well written story with plenty of moral lessons in life.,1439337600,3,99,4.2631578947368425
7182713,4,B00XQ2CC6O,"""Do you believe you can do this?"" Pepper (Salvati) is very very close with his father. Even though he is very little and is teased by everyone in town his father is his shelter and they do everything together. When his dad gets called away to fight in WWII Pepper is devastated. After he is told that if the war was to end his father will come home. Pepper tries anything he can think of, including a list given to him by a priest. This is one of the best family movies to come out in a long time. It is the type of movie that if it doesn't move you emotionally you are dead inside. The subject matter, and some scenes are a little harsh, but it reflects the times. That said this is not a movie you should worry about your kids watching and is one you definitely should all watch together. A moving story about the human spirit that is just flat out wonderful and touching. Overall, get your family together and watch this one, you won't be disappointed. I give it a B+.",1439164800,16,971,4.197860962566845
7182714,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Movie was very touching,insightful in regards to blind prejudice,forgiveness,faith and acceptance of what Gods will may be for us . I do not think it is appropriate for children under 12 due to subject matter,may be above their ability to have needed perspective for content.",1439164800,3,275,5.133333333333334
7182715,5,B00XQ2CC6O,Reviewers hated it!! Audiences loved it!! One of my favorite movies ever. The best ending ever!!! I will be buying it!!!,1439078400,6,120,4.761904761904762
7182716,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"Well I have to admit very good Movie about a young boys faith in God to bring his Dad home from the War. But it was more than that it about respect and forgiveness, and to let go of the hate that the war brought. I have to admit this still holds true today giving forgiveness in the face of evil is not at all easy. There is a message here sometimes we judge face or look of the person to be bad but we can be mistaken and wrongly accuse, so lets not judge so we will not be judge.  I find it hard to hold true to first commandment to love the Load the God with all thy strength and all thy Might . Then if so we can do this everything else falls into place that also means to love you enemy as well.",1438819200,7,700,3.761904761904762

8716483,5,B00XQ2CC6O,"I thought this movie was very unexpected and unusual; it wasn't the usual predictable story line.  It doesn't deliver a sermon, it just show events unfold in such a way that life is unpredictable and can be painful as well as very touching and beautiful.  I think it is a great film, not for very young children as some of the scenes are a little too graphic, but a very good movie for age 10 on up and I think teen age children really should see it.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.",1533427200,,487,4.159574468085107
