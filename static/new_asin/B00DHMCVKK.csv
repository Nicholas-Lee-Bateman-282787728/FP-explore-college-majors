5813421,5,B00DHMCVKK,Such a great idea for all toddlers and young children.  I learned a lot just by watching it a few times with my 15 month old granddaughter.  It alleviates some of the frsustration when a child is not talking yet because they DO understand and can respond to both verbal and visual commands.,1425254400,,290,4.452830188679245
5813422,5,B00DHMCVKK,My baby is picking up so much from this video--he loves the songs!,1424131200,,66,4.153846153846154

5813424,5,B00DHMCVKK,Grandson seems to love it. Time will tell how much he learns.,1421366400,,61,4.166666666666667
5813425,5,B00DHMCVKK,We have used this for 3 kids now and all of them have loved it and learned a lot.  It teaches them how to communicate with you while they can't talk.,1419724800,,149,3.806451612903226
5813426,5,B00DHMCVKK,"My son had a trach until he was 6 months old, so he was unable to vocalize at all until that time. Baby signing time has worked wonders in helping him to express himself. In one day (starting at 12 months old) he had three signs down, and in the weeks to follow it's helped our whole family to communicate with him. His face lights up when we play this video and he asks for it daily by signing ""baby"". I bought four more baby signing time/signing time DVD's right away because his progress has been lightning speed with this program.",1413676800,8,534,4.297029702970297
5813427,5,B00DHMCVKK,"I've seen first hand how Baby Signing can benefit a small child, into toddler years.... for them as well as for parents and babysitters!  It's obviously wonderful for children who are slow to get all their words learned... but it's equally beneficial for baby's/toddlers who do have an extended vocab.... because it seems to calm them down when excited or upset and they'll use signing when they're too upset to get all the words out understandably....  I highly recommend it!",1393977600,9,476,4.9375
5813504,3,B00DHMCVKK,I give it a three star cause the cd has no value but the DVDs signing granddaughter love it the book not sure on that one cause haven't use,1508803200,,139,3.8275862068965516
5813505,5,B00DHMCVKK,My 19 month old granddaughter absolutely LOVES this dvd.  She comes running whenever I turn it on. She picked up the signs really fast. I bought all 4 volumes to give her for holidays or special occasions. She started watching these around 12 months...and she's now on Volume 3. I am shocked how quickly she learned the signs. Definitely recommend!,1508284800,,348,4.8
5813506,2,B00DHMCVKK,This is ideal for babies that can hear; not for deaf babies.,1507161600,,60,4.083333333333333
5813507,5,B00DHMCVKK,This started Baby Signing Time  w our 22 month old granddaughter! She ask to hear Rachel daily. She can now sign well and pronounce her words clearer,1504483200,,149,4.518518518518518
5813508,5,B00DHMCVKK,"This is so adorable, for both you and your child.  At the same time, you and your baby will learn to communicate with one another before speaking from the mouth comes in.",1503878400,,170,4.3125
5813509,3,B00DHMCVKK,Seems like a very educational DVD for kids. I just wish my kids liked it. They watch it for a few minutes then they are done with it.,1501718400,,133,3.7857142857142856
5813510,5,B00DHMCVKK,"My now three year old & one year old LOVE baby signing time! After the first time I put it on for my son (around 10 months), he started signing ""baby"" to ask to watch it. It's a wonderful program!",1500595200,,196,3.925
5813511,5,B00DHMCVKK,"My toddler knows all the signs now! He always asks to watch this. Seeing other babies signing has helped me better recognize my own child's signs. They don't do them perfectly, so it's good to see the possible variations. With practice, my son has gotten pretty good. It has helped him feel more confident with communication and he is saying a lot more words now (signing and talking at the same time). We ended up buying the next video too.",1497139200,2,441,4.525
5813512,5,B00DHMCVKK,Love this. Baby at 4 months is already enjoying this!  She coos at the tv. Warning to parents - the songs will get stuck in your head for hours!,1496275200,,144,3.9655172413793105

8593292,5,B00DHMCVKK,"The baby totally loves this, and recently (at ten months) signed ""dog"" at a dog park and ""cat"" with the family kitty.

8593294,5,B00DHMCVKK,"These dvds are so amazing! I love all 4 of the baby volumes! It has taught my son so much, and when it is on he is focused! It gives me mommy time and him time to learn! The cd that comes with this pack stays in my car for when my son is inconsolable, when that theme song hits he is silent! Its so comforting to him!",1514592000,,317,3.676470588235294
