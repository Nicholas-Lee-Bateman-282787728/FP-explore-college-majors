3437288,5,B0019HABE8,"On the first day of high school, Haruhi Suzumiya stands before her new class and introduces herself as having ""no interest in ordinary humans"". She is only interested in aliens, time travelers, sliders or espers, watching her weird behaviour is Kyon, 'ordinary human,' who sits in front of her and is the only person who talks to her. Haruhi wants nothing to do with him till Kyon comments about Haruhi's practice of joining every club in school and then quitting he unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own after school club. Thereafter Kyon and several others find themselves dragged, literally, into the 'Save our world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi's Brigade' (the S.O.S. Brigade for short).

3437292,5,B0019HABE8,"As others will say, yes for sure watch this in original broadcast order, instead of the chronological order presented on the discs. I don't exactly know how to say it but it definitely feels much more like the rising action and climax of a story when viewed this way.
DVD quality is good and of course you do get the option for the original Japanese audio. What it doesn't include is a way to watch the episodes in broadcast order or even tell you about that. (there is a more limited set which additionally has broadcast order dvd's as a bonus but only in Japanese, no dub)
The other thing I didn't like about the dvd encoding was that all the episodes on each disc are one continuous video file. This makes playing the episode you want more difficult if you're watching this on a computer. It also means the next episode will automatically play even if you didn't select the Play All option.

While many people wouldn't mind such a thing and some would probably prefer more tv shows on dvd to play them all through, this is probably the very worst show for this because of the fact that the episodes are better off in broadcast order, not their dvd order.

I liked the extras but it seemed hard to find everything and often found myself unsure which ones I watched and which I didn't. This might be because they are supplemented to the episodes on each disc so if you watch them in broadcast order, you also have to jump around to watch the special features to coincide.
The complete video of the ending song dance without credits or any other clips spliced in is included, but it's not very well marked on disc 4.",1395705600,,1616,4.419463087248322

If she wasn't it the show it might be tolerable. It's a slice of life show with minimal other-worldly elements thrown in every six or seven episodes to keep you just interested enough to see where it might lead.

Since there was no 2nd season at the time, this was the ""Complete Collection."" So the title of the box is somewhat outdated which in turn makes it unintentionaly misleading for thoes who have seen or heard of the 2nd season.

Now on the anime; for all its worth, it's a great show with pretty good humor. It's one of thoes animes that you really haver to get into if you're not familiar with it. The picture quality is actualy very good.

The codec is done very well. I remember watching this on my (then) DVD player with S-Video, and it looked pretty good. Now that I have an HDTV, it looks even better; save for when there's so much stuff happening on the screen, then the picture does suffer a little. All in all, it was a good purchase.

Season two and all of its exploits are left out of this collection, but you can buy that for about the same price. It comes with fourteen episodes, approximately 350 minutes. It is in Japanese audio with english subtitles, English 5.1 audio, and English 2.0 audio (Not sure what the difference is) It contains four discs, two clamped on each side of the case. It has the televised commercial and textless opening and endings, among other things. The box art is fantastic and really captures the cartoony and humorous feel of the whole show.

Normally these things turn out badly, but this time, it was SO worth it! I went into Haruhi totally blind, having never seen an episode before this DVD set, so I cannot judge based on the special editions or the other season 1 set. I honestly thought this was well put together and loved it. I'm definitely going to buy season 2 (even though that one got mediocre reviews) and I'm going to start on the novels. I loved the UST between Haruhi and Kyon. I really want to know how their relationship develops.

3437307,5,B0019HABE8,"I just wanted to put this out there.  The episodes are ordered more along the lines of the light novel.  But the ultimate conclusion occurs very early in the series, and the remaining episodes were televised in Japan in the middle of the series as 'filler' episodes.  Meaning they did not move ahead the central story arc, but served to develop characters and have self contained plots in stand alone episodes.

The series is great.  I have not watched the English dub because I am a huge fan of the quality of the Japanese voice acting in this series.  It is a romantic drama/comedy, but one with a lot of 'supernatural' events and powers.  Animation quality is fluid and clean.  Sound is excellent.  Often the translation for the subtitles is questionable, but it doesn't really detract overall.  They are pretty spot on for the most part.

I would say that this is one of the must own romantic comedy/drama series of the past few years (along with School Rumble) and I am happy that it is part of my collection.

Of note:  you can look online to find the original Japanese air dates if you want to watch in that order.  Or you can do what I did: watch in order on the DVD, then go back and re-watch in the Japanese air date order on your next go through.  Either way is fine.  Just make your own call... do you go with the novella order (which is this release's order) or go with the Japanese episode air date order?

Regardless it is a stunning series.",1318982400,5,1456,4.413533834586466
3437308,4,B0019HABE8,"A warm-hearted, humorous, and strange little show, The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi certainly demands one's attention.  The hyperactive title character provides the show with much of its heart and charisma, as well she should--she is the center of her own self-wrought universe, albeit unknowingly, and has surrounded herself with disparate (and yet shockingly familiar!) characters.  Her desire to have an alien, an ESPer, and a time-traveler ends up creating a cast of characters most viewers will recognize from other anime: the preternaturally good-natured and handsome bishounen, the quiet, almost asexual Rei-type, and the very busty, sweet, innocent and eager to please ""moe"" type.  But the show uses this element of the plot to poke fun at itself, with Haruhi constantly saying things like, ""We need THIS kind of person for the club!"" with the understanding being that the club requires this kind of character because that particular character niche in the show has not yet been filled.

Although most of the characters are pretty standard, Suzumiya is something more.  While her most obvious character trait is her bossiness, I feel that she becomes a true character (instead of an anime clich) through a certain implied vulnerability which balances out her otherwise dominating traits, and serves to make her loveable and human, instead of irritating.  We realize that Kyon follows along with her plans not because he's intimidated, or because he thinks she's God (one of the characters does), but because he truly cares about her.  The fact that she feels the need to create these intricate worlds, and yet remains unaware of them or her power is sort of sad, in a sweet and adorable way.  It also implies an underlying depression and deep dissatisfaction with reality that the show never fully addresses.  I unfortunately cannot help seeing this as a missed opportunity to develop both her character and Kyon's.

Which leads me to my gripes.  While the chronological structure is unconventional, it did not bother me, and I can imagine watching it both ways (chronological or broadcast order) and being equally satisfied.  I also was not concerned that the show contained ""too much filler,"" as some have mentioned.  The kids have their own club, and they do different things in the club.  A picaresque structure works for this kind of narrative.  Furthermore, I enjoy the fact that Melancholy pays tribute to high school animes by including both a beach and a baseball episode.  They are a lot of fun and fans expect them.  What irked me was the romantic plot.  I must say that I wanted more--not physically, or anything--but more advancement, maybe one more episode devoted to fleshing out  Kyon and Haruhi's relationship.  I ended up liking and caring about these characters and I wanted to know more, and wanted them to have some kind of emotional consummation.  Call me greedy.  However, the end is well done, and I WAS pleased with it.  I just felt that there could have easily been something more here.",1312848000,,3021,5.03420523138833

3437310,2,B0019HABE8,"Just to be clear: Haruhi is a 5 star anime, arguably one of the best ever made. This is a review of this particular DVD release, whose shortcomings are irredeemable.

First of all, the voice acting. It's good!... is what I thought initially. The first couple of episodes are narrated almost exclusively by the character Kyon, whose English voice actor is surprisingly competent at capturing the spirit of the anime. Everything breaks down, however, when Haruhi herself starts talking. I don't know if she was miscast, if she didn't understand her character, or if she just plain didn't care, but it's painful to hear. Every time she opens her mouth, what comes out is a barrage of misplaced emphasis and confusing emotion. The other characters fill in the range, from ok (Mikuru sounds more or less like she should) to not so great (Nagato, who fortunately doesn't have many lines). Now, none of this would really matter if it weren't for the fact that...

Second of all, the subtitles. You've got your par-for-the-course shoddy commercial translation, with plenty of questionable decisions made and liberties taken. But if that was all it was, that would be passable. Then comes the size. For some inexplicable reason, Bandai decided to render the subtitles in a massive, bold, garishly yellow font. The subtitles eat up about a quarter of the screen, and that's hardly an exaggeration. It's as if someone decided that instead of normal subtitles, they should have captions for the vision impaired. Since DVDs store subtitles as image overlays, no DVD player will have an option to shrink down the font. So, you can watch the upper 75% of Haruhi. Or at least you could, if it weren't for...

Third of all, and most egregiously, the series on disk is entirely out of order. They shuffled things around, so that the season finale now happens in the middle of disk 2 out of 4. Haruhi has an appropriate anachronological watch order, one that properly unravels the plot in a riveting fashion. The episodes have instead been resorted to a chronological order (except it isn't even that, since they left what should have been episode 11 chronologically at episode 1), so that instead of a masterful and revolutionary storytelling style, you get a disjointed and poorly flowing set of episodes. It's as if someone made you watch ""Back to the Future 3"" before the original, since the 1800s are chronologically before the 1980s. If you want to watch it in the proper order, I hope you don't mind interrupting the autoplay and swapping out the disk every other episode... if you can even figure out how, since the episodes have been helpfully renumbered, and the ""next episode"" spots accordingly messed with. Bandai isn't the only one at fault for this last point, since Haruhi's Japanese publishers also committed this sin, but they really ought to have known better.

Together, these three points manage to bring down what was once a brilliant masterpiece to below a threshold of even watchable. This collection will alienate any previous fans, and all but the most dedicated prospective viewer will be put off before they finish it. This release is a trainwreck that isn't recommendable at any price. If you are an American anime lover, the best thing you can do at this point is buy the set, place it, unwrapped, on your shelf, and then go download a fansub so you can actually enjoy your anime.",1301788800,22,3390,4.849740932642487

The Plots have been better described by the prior reviews , but they have left out SO MUCH!
Unlike many other comics & anime , this series has a very REAL feeling to it, many of the buildings & locations seen actually exist in the real world, you get the urge to visit them sometime on vacation, & the Music actually charted in Japan on a song or 2 because the star Aya Hirano, is actually a VERY talented Musician, The musical backdrop to the series also REALLY helps it convey the emotions effectively at the appropriate times.

Overall, very comedic & random with fan service as an added bonus.
The voice acting is right on target with the characters feeling more lively & personalities conveyed more effectively with reality. The dialogue is a typical high school peer to peer conversation but with randomness & unusual behaviour.

3437316,5,B0019HABE8,"The first season of ""Haruhi Suzumiya"" is guaranteed to cheer you up with cute sexual innuendos, scientific mumbo-jumbo and a symbolic religious message hidden underneath the fan service.

The show is based on an oddball story, focusing on a high school boy named Kyon, who meets an unusual high school girl named Haruhi Suzumiya. The girl is a strange firebrand, who is more interested in aliens, espers (psychics) and time travelers than in actual humans. Somehow, Kyon strikes up an unusual friendship with this girl.

However, Kyon never planned on getting involved with starting up Haruhi's own club, the S.O.S. Brigade. The club's mission is to spread happiness around the world, through all the fetishes that anime geeks would love. Aliens. Psychics. And an adorable time traveler girl with big breasts. The show pretty much covers all of Kyon's experiences with Haruhi, the bossy dominatrix who may have mysterious powers of her own.

Although it is hard to discuss this series without revealing some major spoilers, the show is a major hit with college anime clubs in America for many reasons. The first episode is a big home movie spoof, where the high school characters try to act like Haruhi's favorite anime characters in an embarassing film project loaded with weird jokes. The ending credit sequence features the funniest and most infamous anime dance, performed by Haruhi and the other members of the S.O.S. Brigade. And the philosophical members of the S.O.S. Brigade always treat Haruhi like she's a supernatural being who has the willpower to change humanity as we know it.

Religious pundits will no doubt scoff at this off-kilter combination of sexual tension and philosophical dialogue. However, they will no doubt remember this series for all the jokes that seem to come out of nowhere. This is one of the few series that packs all the goofy anime-style fetishes that fans will love. You know, like girls in bunny suits, speedy fights with alien girls and philosophical jokes about the meaning of life. Even the broadcast of the show presented the episodes in an unconventional manner, like a anime-style version of ""Pulp Fiction.""

The show was also a milestone series which featured many new story-telling styles for an animated film. The narrative is told completely from the first-person perspective of Kyon. The first episode presents the animation from the lens of a shaky, indie-style camera. The tone of the series can switch drastically from light comedy to an apocalyptic thriller sequence. Unlike most anime shows with romantic comedy, ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" features some frightening scenes in the fifth episode, with blood and gore.

The gutsy cinematography effects and genre bending stories all contribute to make this one of the most unusual anime series ever made. Although plenty of other romantic comedies delivered similar conservative themes of love and codependency, ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" was the only one that flooded the love story with the best gut-busting pop culture references. And anime has only gotten better because of it.",1282003200,27,3102,5.157057654075547
3437317,5,B0019HABE8,"This is a review by a teenager, me.

  At first glance, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya looks like your normal average ""slice of life"" anime. Well, it totally isn't!

  The series is told from the perspective of Kyon. Kyon is a (somewhat) normal teenage boy who is entering high school. Though at one point he did sort of believe in aliens, time-travelers, demons, ghosts, espers, evil organizations and superheros (though he never once believed in Santa Claus) he does not anymore. He firmly acknowledges that aliens, time-travelers and espers do not exist in the world of reality. But then, on the first day of high school, he meets HER : Haruhi Suzumiya.

  Unlike Kyon, Haruhi firmly acknowledges that aliens, time-travelers and espers DO exist. She even tells everyone that if any of them are any of these things that they are to come see her. Haruhi delights in the extraordinary and dislikes and is bored by the ordinary. She is obnoxious, quirky, eccentric, has a bit of an attitude, and is determined to get what she wants, no matter what it takes. And some of her methods are...not pretty. Haruhi excels at about everything that is put in front of her, from grades to sports to music. But, like I said before, she is bored with her school. So, with some unintentional inspiration from Kyon, she starts her own club, the S.O.S Brigade (this stands for Save our World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade) and forces Kyon to join. Soon after, she recruits other members, Yuki, Mikuru, and Itsuki. Before long, all the new members come to Kyon and each tells him that they are an alien (Yuki), a time-traveler (Mikuru), and an esper (Itsuki). They also all say the same thing: Haruhi has powers that can destroy the world, and Haruhi has also, subconsciously, ""chosen"" Kyon. Kyon's ""sci-fi free"" world begins to crumble apart as he finds out that they all speak the truth. One after another, hilarious (and some not so hilarious) adventures happen as Haruhi leads her group. The brigade members (except Kyon, because he does not like ""cheating"" and insists that Haruhi learns the hard way) try to keep her happy so she won't cause the end of the world.

  This series is truly outrageously funny. Some scenes, episodes, and content I did not like, and even some of the content was confusing, thought in general this is not a confusing series. But, when watching this anime, keep in mind that this is a spoof, particularly a spoof of science fiction. This is a great series. It is basically a mix of school life and science fiction. Some moments are really funny, goofy, crazy, and did I say FUNNY? Especially hilarious are Kyon's view and opinions about whatever subjects pop up, and some of Haruhi's antics. I really recommend this series. It is interesting, enjoyable, entertaining, and great fun!",1278547200,,2822,4.783950617283951
3437318,3,B0019HABE8,"Not really a product review, but a warning.

This is simply a cheaper packaged version of the season 1 box set.

I pre-ordered this directly from Bandai Entertainment thinking it contained both Haruhi season 1 and season 2.  I was led to believe this from Bandai's website which stated ""Episodes: All of them!"".

I also knew that season 2 was due to be released this summer, and this had a July sale date, so I assumed that THIS was going to be season 2.
You almost have to wonder if this was done on purpose to get some more sales from confused folks.

You can imagine my reaction when I opened the package!

At any rate, the actual release of season 2 is in August apparently; there is a pre-order here on Amazon somewhere.

In good faith, I can't give this a ""1 star"".  It is Haruhi after all.  I just wish that they were more clear on their marketing.",1278460800,14,855,4.29375
3437319,4,B0019HABE8,"**At Netflix this anime is listed as a 5 disc series. Disc 5 being labeled as ""Bonus Material.""  I looked for info on disc 5 but all I could find was information concerning an extra music cd that comes with the Limited Edition box set (I believe). Please let me know if the bonus cd futhers the story in any way and I will revise this review.**

There are a lot of anime with unsatisfying endings, and ones that have decent endings but still leave tons of unanswered questions.  However, I personally haven't seen many that have no ending whatsoever.  MoHS would be the second, School Rumble was (if memory serves) the first.

It starts off perfectly fine.  The idea that Haruhi creates and destroys just because she becomes unhappy, bored, depressed, etc, is interesting, but even more so because she has no idea that she is doing so.  One starts to wonder if she will ever find out she's doing these things, or if her friends will ever tell her about what she's doing, or if they can find a way to...keep her from destroying the world without actually letting her know what's going on.

Sounds like a great, intriguing mystery right?  Well, don't get too excited.  About the time things start to get really good, the filler episodes start coming and don't stop.  It's kind of like the creator got serious writer's block, and took the easy way out.  Out of nowhere Haruhi starts acting like a (fairly) typical high school girl, and all the mysterious goings-on just...vanish.

I gave this series 4 stars though because it is actually entertaining.  The animation is really nice, the characters are likable, and over all MoHS is a good series. Crispin Freeman and Wendy Lee are pro V/As. I have noticed quite a few people recommend watching in a certain order concerning episode numbers.  Apparently, that way it seems like there is some semblance of an ending, but looking back, I don't think that would make much of a difference.  It is what it is, as they say.  With that in mind, I recommend renting instead of buying.

Bandai did a heck of a marketing campaign for this series.  DVD extras include behind the scenes production shorts in Japan and America, as well as ""The Adventures of the ASOS Brigade"" featuring Patricia Lee (a.k.a the Pink Power Ranger) as Haruhi in a series of live action promo videos.  The fact they spent so much time and money doing this for a series with no ending is, in my opinion, mystifying.

This is one of those anime flicks I believe everyone ""loves"" because someone else 'loved' it before them. The notion of a goddess creating a universe of girls crazed for one average guy just doesn't interest me. The notion of the series appears 'complex' on the surface but is really the same ol' same ol': cute girls want one average guy. Save your money and RENT this before buying it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it. For me, I shouldn't have to waste my time watching MORE than one disk of the series to become *remotely* interested.
Good points:
To be fair? The character design (visually...not substance) is neat, the animation is fantastic, it does have its moments of humor, and it's a decent source for some pop culture. I was sucked into buying this when I watched the promo-- who doesn't love an opening para-para with some cute characters?",1264896000,7,876,4.694805194805195
3437323,5,B0019HABE8,"The series is great but the DVD release has one major flaw:  the studio mixed the order of the episodes in an attempt to make them chronologically correct.  Instead they actually made matters worse.  Episodes 6 and 7 actually finish up the series.  It makes sense when viewed in this order.  Also episode 00 should be seen last as it makes little sense until after the finale.

Check the wikipedia site and follow the broadcast order for best results.

Anyway, the show is great, a kind of newer version of Tenchi Muyo.  The characters are all likable and burst with personality.  The animation is top notch and the musical score is also great.  This is a series for all ages, though teenagers and older will get most of the references.  Also, for those not well versed in anime, a few jokes will be over your head (like when Haruhi says ""Launch the Gundam!!!"" but they bleep out part of Gundam and the actual Gundam is blurred).

Overall a light hearted and fun series that should be enjoyed in the proper order and not Bandai's screwy order on the DVDs... just make sure episodes 00, 5 and 6 are last (or rewatch with those as the last)!",1264204800,3,1139,4.475728155339806

There's a lot of hilarious comedy (and it should be noted, I don't always find anime humor that funny), some drama-lite, some sci-fi elements--indeed the entire series was ""created by otaku lovers for otaku lovers.""  (""Otaku"" refers to the culture of people who love anime, manga, and video games, etc.)

I can't add a whole lot that everyone else already has by now, but I will say do yourself a favor and look up the original Japanese broadcast order.  When they made the dvds (for Japan and U.S.) they released the episodes in chronological order which is NOT how they were meant to be seen, and it is in fact much more enjoyable and meaningful to watch them in their original broadcast order.

I will say, being a huge fan of the series and owning some of the limited editions--they are well worth the extras, not just for the convenience disc, but they are jampacked with really cool goodies.  That said, for the person just giving this a try, or if you think $200 is too much to spend for a boxed set--and that I'm willing, shows you how much I love the series--this is a worthy box set, though admittedly bare bones as far as anime sets go.",1260057600,,1215,4.5504587155963305

3437327,2,B0019HABE8,"I was quite interested to try this series out.  I knew it had one hell of a following, and that dance was all over the place a few years back.  I started with episode 00.  That was a mistake.  If you are going to watch, don't bother with that episode until you have a sense of the characters. Come back to it after finishing the first 4 episodes or so.

Now, on to the disappointment.  I am completely baffled as to how anyone could sing the praises of this series.  It is a genuine snoozefest.  I refused to give up on it despite my boredom.  I kept going, but in the middle of episode 9, I just pressed stop and returned the series.  They were going back to the theme of alternate reality bubbles and I'd just had enough.

There is a lot of potential in this show, but it goes unrealized and ignored for the most part.  The characters are great and there are moments of genuine humor, mostly revolving around Kyon's deadpan reactions to Haruhi's ridiculousness.  However, laughs were few and far between.  The whole premise feels overly serious and half-baked.  They delve into philosophical and existential realms that are best left to boring arm chair discussions amongst those who enjoy talking in circles.

I wanted so much to enjoy this show.  It sounded from all descriptions and the generally positive public reaction to be a wonderful and entertaining show, but it put me to sleep on three separate occasions.  I even tried to watch it in 1.5 speed to counter the unnecessary slowness of the show.  It helped a bit, but even being a fan of Jarmusch, this show was often too slow.

It's hard to give a cohesive analysis of the show because it never felt cohesive for a moment, and I have so many issues with it.  Here's the bottom line: don't bother.",1248998400,7,1759,4.468553459119497

Cons:
1. The DVDs come in a pretty cool looking box, but mine started to tear after my first day of using the DVDs
2. The english subs aren't as amazing as I'd like them to be; I mean, seriously, giant green text? I'd rather go online and watch a pretty fan sub.
3. I'm not really feeling the different order of the episodes. The volumes have the episodes in the order in which the events happened, not the original broadcast order. I found that the new order tended to get boring while starting to get into the ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part...."" episodes.

Pros:
1. The English dub is pretty awesome in my opinion, but the original japanese sounds more natural to me.
2. The actual animation is pretty well-done; I enjoyed many of the action-ish scenes in the show because of all the detail Kyoto put into the animation.
3. The disks inside the box come in the nice individual DVD boxes you'd find if you went to Borders and purchased the 4 volumes individually.
4. The special features are pretty awesome. They have Nekoman galleries, textless openings and endings, The Adventures of the ASOS Brigade, and The Making of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

To sum it all up, I'm glad that I bought the series. Even though, the collection has some flaws, it's still pretty awesome!",1244160000,5,1430,4.513513513513513

When I watched it, again, I got caught by the catchy enthusiastic opening and ending songs.  If you are ever feeling down, this music will perk you right up.

The story line is good and zany.  Even though this is all fiction, I can see correlations with current ideas seen in ""The Secret"", teachings of Abraham-Hicks, etc.  Create your own reality by consciously using your mind/imagination/emotions.  Like Haruhi, most humans are not aware of their personal power, but are still creating, but on an unconscious level.

3437333,5,B0019HABE8,"I have been following anime since the days of Bubblegum Crisis, Ranma 1/2, Akira, etc. I was in love with anime during the late 1990's, and fell out of love with it in the early 2000's.  By that time, a lot of the series were running together thematically, artistically, and narratively.  I have sampled some anime since then, including: Naruto, Maburaho, and many others released in that time period, or which became popular in that time period.  And NONE of them have GRABBED me like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya did!

The story starts off rather boring, and confusing.  They use the tried and true ""fan service"" at first, to hook you in.  At least, that is what it SEEMS like they are doing.  In reality, they are setting you up for one of the most original, and mind bending stories I have seen or heard in a LONG time.

In short, Haruhi is not an ordinary girl.  She is seeking the abnormal, the weird, the non-normal side of life.  And she has found it, she just doesn't know she has found it.  The story is told from the point of view of the guy who unwittingly befriends her, and then follows the bizarre and extremely entertaining and complexly woven tale which is Haruhi's life.

The series is entirely too short.  It clocks in at only 14 episodes, and at least 2 of them are clearly ""filler"" episodes.  But, even then, the rest of them are breath taking in their complexity, interesting story telling, and bizarre take on the world.  You HAVE TO see this, if you are an anime fan!

Is it a perfect anime?  No, of course not.  It has many of the same flaws that many anime series have.  Is it 100% original?  No, of course not.  Many of the mainstays in anime are present here (it is sort of a harem anime, sort of a high school anime, and sort of a sci-fi anime, all rolled into one).  Is it an entertaining, unique (in its own right) and fun anime?  You had better believe it.  You will be in love with Haruhi by episode 2 or 3, I guarantee it.",1239753600,,1961,4.324175824175824

The reason I am giving this a 2 star is simply because I really feel that the series just fizzles out after not really going anywhere for a while.
...I thought that it started off pretty promising, with a really beautiful opening sequence and some interesting characters. After a rather unexpected and visually stunning fight scene taking place (I think this takes place near the beginning of the second DVD episodes), with the promise of ""more"" battles to come, the series just kind of....meanders. I've long been a fan of plotless animes, I loved Azumango Diaoh, but I guess it was just frustrating to have a central storyline where you have this set of characters who have certain abilities/powers and they are all centered/summoned to be around the main character because ""something"" happened to get them all there and then..............nothing. Seriously. Nothing. Just some cute episodes and then it stops. Done. Before I started to write this I reread the Amazon review and they actually do state that the story recedes as the series progresses and that it doesn't actually ""end""....so, I guess I should have payed more attention to the Amazon review.

Fans of Azumanga Daioh, this is for you. Of corse, they are two different things. Azumanga Daioh is about 5 high school girls, while The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is narrated by a boy, (Kyon).
It has extremely funny scenes in each episode, and I highly reccomend it.
NOTE: This anime does have some content that is not suitable for children under the age of 13. In episode 1 (Or 0 for that matter), Haruhi starts squeezing Mikuru's breasts. In episode 2, there is a scene of ""sexual harrasment"". Haruhi often forces Mikuru to change when Kyon is in the room. And they take their bras of too, but Kyon quickly runs out of the rooms freaked out. There is one more thing I'd like to tell you. Kyon is not the ""perverted"" type of highschooler. But he does use a bit of sexual refferences while picking up the girls clothes of the ground.

It really is amusing watching the other main character, Kyon trying to interact with her. I'm sure it will keep you watching and wondering what the heck is going on...and that leads me to the beauty of Haruhi Suzumiya. It's just the mystery of this girl that keeps you hooked. You just have to know what Haruhi is all about. It would have been great had they taken this a bit further and see a more mature relationship with her friend Kyon.

This short lived 14 episode favorite is narrated by 14 year old Kyon and boy entering high school ready to adjust to the normal world. All he has to do is forget about his fantasies of the paranomal and fantastic. All of a sudden the girl that sits behind him in class is not ready to let that world go and before he knows it Kyon is dragged into starting the S.O.S. Brigade a club bent on uncovering the secrets of the world we just can't find or explain. All of a sudden the members begin to sign up and they each turn out to be something unexpected. Yuki Nagato is a silent genius with her nose in the books, Mikuru Asahina is a cute and extremly shy Junior with a few key 'assets' and Istuki Koizumi is an exchange student always with a smile on his face ready for the next S.O.S. Brigade adventure. Haruhi seems be enjoying herself, but Kyon knows something she doesn't Haruhi recruited an Alien Android a Time Traveler from the future and an ESPer that belongs to an entire organization whose mission is to keep the world in balance. Oh and apparently they are all keeping their eye on Haruhi because she has the ability to create new worlds and destroy old ones in the process. So why is she so bored with life...she doesn't know she can do that. So much for an ordinary life Kyon.

Can Haruhi Suzumiya become a victim of its hype or is it a brilliant show regardless? I say brilliant.

In high school, it's hard to develop an identity and stand out without being an outsider but for Haruhi Suzumiya, she enjoys her offbeat sensibilities. Declaring in school that she's not interested in anyone unless they're time travellers, aliens or espers (psychics in other words), Haruhi soon is introduced to Kyon, a sardonic high school student who enjoys just not doing anything. But their world gets changed when in comes Itzuki, Yuki and Mikuru, an esper, alien and time traveller, respectively. Turns out Haruhi is seen as a sort of god-like figure who can bend the universe and possibly even destroy it and start over lest she get bored. Luckily Haruhi is quite...eccentric.

One of the more well-known factors consider the show was that the show's episodes were not presented in chronological order. While this worked in some cases such as episode 6 having all the makings of a ""finale"" and episode 11 which consists of Kyon narrating over a supremely amateurish movie Haruhi made makes for a unique and also bizarre premiere but then on the other hand, a 2 parter on an island vista is separated by a different episode so the cliffhanger isn't resolved until the following episode. My suggestion is to just watch the chronological order but exchange episode 14 (Kyon's trip for a heater) and 6's place and all will be well.

As for the episodes themselves, they're frequently hilarious from dialogue to Kyon's narration or Yuki's quiet badassness/bookish tendencies and just scenes played straight for comedy or using the moe conventions of nurse/maid/catgirl outfits for humor. But the main plot is also interesting and while Yuki's explanation of Haruhi's existence from her perceptive is Evangelion-level confusing complete with screen-filling text, it's quite intriguing and the idea that the world can literally revolve around you makes for good storytelling. Some episodes are generally good with at least one cool scene while others such as an arts festival, a computer battle or the hilarious baseball episode are definate highlights.

Will everyone like it? Maybe. Some people prefer the romance hilarity found in Love Hina while others are into more lighthearted affairs like Fruits Basket but I loved the show and can't wait for an inevitable second season and I heartily recommend you try the show out.",1216771200,35,3038,5.033797216699801

8274038,5,B0019HABE8,"Love Haruhi and the English voice actress Wendee Lee who is the perfect match for Haruhi. She is awesome even being crazier than a $1.50 bill. Warning, although this says complete series, it does state the release date being 2008 and the second season wasn't produced until 2009 with the first season in 2006. So if you want the complete series make sure it was released after 2009. I thought the second season was a bit weak. The writers apparently couldn't come up with enough material for another season so they thought changing 5 to 10 minutes of the show and repeating the episode that started the ""Groundhog Day"" reliving would do. A lot of viewers liked that part in the series. I might have if I hadn't watched them back to back. I was so lost through pretty much the entire second season. I'm here looking for the complete 1st and 2nd season collection to watch again in another viewers suggested order to see if it makes more sense in that order.
This series will remain a favorite of millions of anime fans. Do yourself a favor and be your own judge. I've seen too many reviews that had to have been for another anime series because they were way off the mark.",1441411200,,1171,4.4766355140186915

8274044,3,B0019HABE8,"2 or 2 and 1/2 Stars, I thought this was over hyped. The idea was fine the finally product left a lot to be desired. I think I need just a bit more action or something was lacking. I thought Sgt. Frog or The Devil is a Part-Timer or Bamboo Blade were better even if they are not exactly Weird High School Adventures.",1407542400,,316,4.031746031746032
8274045,5,B0019HABE8,"While the story's progress is different from the manga, it's an awesome series. I started watching it online when I was in my first year of high school, and with the exception of blue ray and 3 books (there are 2 manga series from the same characters and whatnot), I have every media content of this franchise released to date. This is one series to not overlook.

As far as the box set you're looking at, it was titled ""Complete Collection"" before season 2 was widely known in america. It's just season 1. The price is up 20 bucks more than when I got it, so the sooner you get this, the better.

Some jokes are unbecoming, though, and that's a real pain.",1407110400,,656,4.32520325203252
