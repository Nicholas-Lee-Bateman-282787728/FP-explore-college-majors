8741584,4,B0186DPY8A,"Slasher fans celebrate.  Destroyer's on Blu-Ray at last.  This movie is cheesy wonderful fun.  A woman in prison movie is being made in an abandoned jail.  Enter an executed ghost/person who kills crew members, etc, one by one, until the savage finale.  I'll admit elements of this are super fantastic and nostalgic, but the product does have it flaws.  The climax seems to run on forever.  Could've used a bit more gore.  But overall, COME ON, this movie is so much fun, and Anthony Perkins is the icing on the horror cake.  Classic slasher.

Edge of Sanity doesn't quite blow my mind as much.  It's a period piece with a lot of sleaze, sex, and throat slashings.  Not terrible, but not stellar by any means.  But paired with Destroyer, you can't go wrong.

No extras besides trailers.  Boo.",1460851200,4,792,4.63768115942029
