8421322,1,B004B2F94U,"I was not impresed with this dvd set at all! I got this set in hopes it would be a narrarated history (similar to a history channel production). This was a bunnch of ""relivent"" short films.  Many are old instructional video, old bio films with poor acting, or news interviews. Several of he stories were more focused on white people with little or no mention of blacks. I suppose they were to set to mood. I was most annoyed with the dvds on the civial war and civil rights movment. I was expecting to see footage of protest or marching. There was none. This is a bunch of loosly strung together videos.  To me the best part was a 4 part sevment on the african burial gto",1361923200,10,671,4.275590551181103
