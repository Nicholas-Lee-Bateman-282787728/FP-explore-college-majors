2816290,5,B000PDZHK0,"He doesn't need to but he can jump as high as his airness! A fantastic collection of SHARK WEEK programs from the last 20 years, this will excite and captivate any shark enthusiast or expert. The 14 episodes cover a diverse spectrum of shark lore, from identification,distribution and preservation to shark attack survivors and ancient sharks including the awesome Megalodon. Fans of the Great White are in for a treat as the shark is featured prominantly in several outstanding episodes. The package design is first class with a holographic cover and great graphics making for an essential purchase. On a final note,the interview with the young russian woman who survived an attack while her boyfriend did not, is one of the most affecting moments this series has produced.",1187049600,4,774,5.0546875
2816291,3,B000PDZHK0,"I have been to universal studios and the shark there is on a timer to leap out of the water.  Same one they used in Jaws I think.  Speaking of Jaws, why is that shark not shown in these?  What a sham!

I liked that shark he just ate people and you know, was like ""hey So-Cal, stay off my beach"" and stuff.  Just a lonely shark trying to get along with the world.  Did you know sharks never stop moving, if they do they die?  There are so many fat people who could learn from that, I don't meant the result I just mean MOVE people does it hurt that much to take a walk once in a while?

Supersize it all you want bubba you will not outswim the sharks!!!!!!!!!!!",1186185600,,660,3.946969696969697
2816292,5,B000PDZHK0,My son is a true shark fanatic and this was as good as gold for him.  He loved and will watch it over and over guaranteed!!!!,1185926400,3,125,3.8076923076923075
2816293,4,B000PDZHK0,"I pre-ordered this dvd and the day it arrived I popped it in the player. The packaging is very nice w/ a cool 3D Jaws pic on the front. 4 discs: 1 and 3 have 3 shows, 2 and 4 have 4 shows each. With the exception of Anatomy of a Bite (90min), most avg around 45 minutes. The shows range from Shark Bite survivors to Air Jaws & Air Jaws II. $19.99 is a fair price for 14 episodes and I did learn a lot. They seem to dwell quite a bit on the Great White, so footage of the leaping sharks in So. Africa can get a bit repetitive. Also Erich Ricter, the scientist whose bite from a bull shark was highlighted in Anatomy of a Bite, makes quite a few appearances throughout the episodes. You'd think that after 20 years of Shark Week, Discovery would include 14 very different episodes in this compliation. I'm a huge Shark Week fan and never miss a year so that's why this dvd was a MUST-OWN, but I do wish it had maybe 6 more episodes and they could have focused on other sharks like the Mako or Tiger vs. focusing quite a bit on the Great White and Bull Shark.. If you like owning Nature DVDs, and perhaps aren't going to record this year's Shark Week episodes, this is a good deal. Just be prepared to watch the majority of the time about Whale, Bull, and Great White Sharks..",1184544000,31,1273,4.116465863453815
2816294,5,B000PDZHK0,"I just found out this was coming out. This is going to be a great dvd set of shark shows from the last 20 years as shown during shark week. I was hoping to see Jaws the true story and The ten deadliest sharks but these will suffice. This is a must for any fans of shark week and I hope they will release more sets.

Edit
I got this set the first day it come out. The episodes look much better then when they were shown on tv however my Toshiba 3950 dvd player has a problem with the menus. The menu pixies however the episodes play fine it's just the menu. My Panasonic has no problem with the menus go figure.",1183852800,4,610,3.959349593495935

2816432,4,B000PDZHK0,I found the actual shark video clips to be exciting. The information presented is informative and seems to be accurate. The presenters vary the information from the most well known species to the most obscure which makes the series even more interesting.,1376956800,,254,5.071428571428571

2816439,5,B000PDZHK0,"Sharkweek has surpassed all other weeks (even Christmas) in my estimation. It is my favorite time of year and all because the Discovery Channel always comes through with excellent programming featuring these fantastic animals. Even if you don't like sharks or are indifferent about sharks, these programs will suck you in and you won't be able to look away. I recommend Air Jaws, Shark City, and anything featuring and/or narrated by Mike Rowe.",1376352000,,444,5.095890410958904

2816458,3,B000PDZHK0,"Some of the episodes are better than others.  The one about the shark attacks in Florida was gripping, although horrifying (which, frankly, is the point of shark week, is it not?).  The ones targeting the Great Whites are what you'd expect; is it me, or have these run their course?  How many tortured seals can one see and not become desensitized?  And the ones about the reef sharks are boring.  However, it didn't cost us anything to download the set, and it at least offered some oceanic background while we focused on assembling a book case.  Because it wouldn't hold our attention by itself.",1374364800,,597,4.6923076923076925

2816485,3,B000PDZHK0,"Ok, that header should be a DUH! But my daughter is 9 and she has my same obsessions with sharks I had as a little girl. The first DVD is attacks on people, not underwater documentaries. Matter of fact I think 3 of the DVDs are about victims and injuries, etc. My daughter is pretty well balanced and it does not bother her to see those kinds of things ( I squirm sometimes). SO I would recommend not letting your little kids watch those DVD's. I think there was no real reason to have any non-shark documentary material involved. It was just fear mongering and scare tactics. We are still swimming with sharks as our Mom and daughter bucket list!",1361318400,,647,4.4

It has become more than a show.  We ""play"" Shark Week with the couch being the boat and we've got decoys and lifeboats, etc.  Loads of fun.",1286236800,,291,3.9655172413793105
2816503,4,B000PDZHK0,"(quote from the back of the box) ""Lurking silently beneath the ocean's surface is one of nature's most terrifying creatures...a powerful predator who can rip its prey apart in a matter of seconds!"" Shark Week always makes sharks look like man eating beasts at first, but when you get through the first few documentaries there is some really interesting information on sharks. While yet yes sharks are dangerous they rarely attack humans, but you wouldn't know this by watching the first few documentaries, Discovery Channel's Shark Week always starts with shark attacks or survivor's of shark attacks, and of course focuses on the great white shark. While yet this is interesting, these documentaries always get repetitive, but for people fascinated with shark attacks it might give you a thrill or make you avoid the ocean even more. My cup of tea lies in the documentaries about the smaller more unheard of sharks, or tracking great white sharks and studying their behavior, it's fascinating how powerful these creatures are and this collection has a nice variety of documentaries.

This DVD includes fourteen documentaries spanning over twenty years and it's a lengthy DVD collection, there are four discs as well as descriptions for each documentary. And for around twenty dollars, this collection is a bargain. And the packaging is very nice, there are many photographs spread across each slim case. If you are lucky, you may also get a bonus disc to go along with the collection. And you may be wondering, what's on it? An episode of the Discovery Channel's popular series Mythbusters, in this episode, Jamie and Adam test some ""Jaws"" inspired myths, and it's a very interesting episode that I would recommend watching.

Shark Week has some great and mediocre programs but for fourteen programs at the price of twenty dollars this is a good bye and it's recommended for people interested or curious about sharks.",1284249600,,1918,5.047318611987381

2816529,4,B000PDZHK0,"Like other reviewers, I'll say that this collection is repetitive, and it reinforces stereotypes by focusing too much on attacks and great whites.  The selection could have reflected more on diversity of species and the importance of sharks in the ocean food chain.

There are, however, some spectacular episodes.  My favorites are the two Air Jaws episodes and the profile of Frank Mundus, famous shark hunter.  His story and personality shine; this one episode alone is worth the price of the collection.  It makes a good companion to the book In The Slick of the Cricket.  I haven't yet read his biography Monster Man, which unfortunately is currently out of print and priced out of my range.",1244592000,,695,4.897435897435898

2816531,5,B000PDZHK0,"I bought this collection for my son and myself because we love the ocean and sharks. But I have to be honest; I have a whole new respect for what is lurking in the waters. The collection is very thorough and heavily filled with information regarding these amazing animals.

My son loves it and is impressed with the different kinds of sharks shown on the dvd. It isn't all about great whites; but after watching this you will be glad they are the biggest biting sharks we have in the ocean.

I would definitely recommend this collection. Some of the information does overlap but all in all a great collection to have. If you are squeamish though there are some of the episodes that you will not want to watch. But if you are like me and while it scares the crap out of you to think of ever getting bitten by a shark; curiousity wins.",1222646400,,833,4.333333333333333
2816532,3,B000PDZHK0,"This set contains some truly fantastic footage of sharks, especially great whites, but is sadly lacking in its quantity of real science on sharks. Virtually nothing is covered on shark biology, physiology, number of species, ranges, habits, etc. Including such information so that the series took the viewers to school and truly educated us about sharks---in addition to the sensational shots of attacks on humans and other prey---would have served the viewer and the sharks much better. Particularly bad was the episode with the mechanical sharks and supposed the attempt to ""study"" the dynamics of a shark bite. It was really more of a tribute to modern FX than anything else. Over all this set is entertaining with its photographic footage of sharks but otherwise disappointing in its lack of substance.",1218153600,13,806,5.1603053435114505
2816533,4,B000PDZHK0,"Yes, yes as some of the reviews have stated, this collection does focus most on the Great White, but frankly, that's the shark we are all interested in.  The Great White is one of the most mysterious and by far the most feared inhabitant of the sea..he's a rock star, get real.  Get this if for no other reason that to have footage of the Great White breaching in the waters off South Africa, it's just amazing footage..and yes, I had seen this series of episodes before, but really i could watch it a thousand times, it's one of the greatest phenomonens in nature..watching a animal that weighs a ton jet six feet out of the water with jaws agape is breathtaking, I don't care how jaded you are..yes, yes if you seen all this a million times on shark week maybe your not going to want this, but if you've only seen it a thousand times, i say..get it..you'll love it..""-).",1217289600,,872,4.3765432098765435

2816550,5,B000PDZHK0,"These videos are very good for the person that doesn't understand the ocean.
These videos can help people understand that shark bites are very rare,
but they do happen.
I do think it says you should respect sharks no matter their size,
from small to extra large.
You don't see sharks growing legs and walking on land, just like
we live on land they live in the water and are faster swimmers than us.
So don't go swimming where you think sharks could be, just remember this
they have found sharks in 3 feet of water.
I rate these DVD's a 5 of 5 stars!!",1198627200,,551,4.257142857142857

2816552,2,B000PDZHK0,"I was VERY disappointed in this collection. Any true shark fan, or in my case, freak, has had most of this collection from when it aired over the past 7 years. When this first came out, I was hoping it would be all the new stuff they were planning to show for the 20th anniversary. It was not. Anatomy of a shark bite came out 2 years after Ritter's attack in 2003 or 4, Air Jaws has been out for about 5 plus years, and so on. I wanted to get Roboshark, Amazon Abyss, and all the other stuff they aired this year and didn't get one of them. If you are looking for new shows from this year, DO NOT get this collection. If you don't have any of the previous Shark Week shows, this is a great collection for you. Happy Shark Watching!!!",1193356800,5,734,4.068965517241379
2816553,3,B000PDZHK0,"Unfortunately these shark week shows are turning to more of a jaws aspect. Instead of showing people what sharks are really like (not that there's much data on that), they are showing people too many shows about shark attacks. I know that shark attacks are what gets viewers, but I didn't find the 20th anniversary as informative and myth dispelling as I expected from Discovery Channel. I was very disappointed with the lineup. There are some good shows in here, I won't deny that, but there were also way more jumping sharks and shark attack shows than there should have been. If you want a little information and a lot of drama, this set may be okay, but don't expect it to be like planet earth or blue planet or anything of that sort of caliber.",1193356800,2,749,4.514705882352941
