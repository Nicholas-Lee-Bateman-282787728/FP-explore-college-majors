Many of the demonstrations are shown from multiple points of view.  Terry covers the safety issues very well.  You should be able to spin metal after seeing this video.",1272326400,,288,4.816326530612245

7794771,5,0976788608,I must admit i was a bit cautious purchasing this dvd - but boy is it worth it.  There is so much information - it is definetly worth the money.  I am a wood turner and am looking into broadening my horizons(aka metal spinning).  After watching the DVD i was extrelemy impressed with his skill and furthermore his explanation of the craft.  Terry does a great job of making you feel like you CAN really do it!  I have already watched it a dozen times and still find something new to learn every time.  I have even incorporated metal spinning pieces into my wood turning. A must buy! Great Job Terry!,1142640000,,599,4.351351351351352
7794772,5,0976788608,"The metal spinning workshop DVD (part one) set is easily the best educational product on the subject of spinning metal. I bought the DVD just after it was released in April 2005 and have watched it at least 15 times, each time learning something new. Nearly 90% of the video covers new and valuable subjects for beginners and experienced craftsmen, which you will not find in any book available on the subject.

 Written & produced by a life long professional metal spinner the information is not only educational it's entertaining. Terry Tynan was the first to produce a DVD on the subject and he was also the first to start a Q&A Internet forum solely dedicated to the craft. Believe me $39.99 for this DVD is nothing compared to the money you will save after watching it.  Cant wait for part two.",1142640000,2,799,4.612676056338028
