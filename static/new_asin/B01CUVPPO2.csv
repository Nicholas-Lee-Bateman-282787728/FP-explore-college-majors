7694345,5,B01CUVPPO2,"This is a way cool video, but it could have been awesome. Here's why - almost all of the jam portions of the video were shot from an audience perspective. When have you ever jammed with a band where you were not up on the stage with them? If you were side by side with them, and maybe had an occasional glance of approval from the players, this video would be a total crack up. The bassist is the only one who sorta gives you a  ""you're a bad mother"" indication.  This change in perspective could actually be edited into the video if they chose to do so.

The choice of music is awesome - covers lots of different tempos and progressions, and the players are some cool Dudes at large.  Lots of fun!!!

7694347,5,B01CUVPPO2,"I was able to go from basic memorization of the pentatonic scales to a fluent step 1 player (I am still only an advanced beginner).  I had a lot of fun in the process.  I stuck with the slow videos until I was able to play without having to think about every note and then moved to the faster ones.  As I go to the next step I can use this DVD the same way.  My goal is to use each of the 5 pentatonic patterns for minor and major and learn them thoroughly and then move on to double notes (They sound really cool!) and I expect this DVD to be my main support during this process,  It helps that the players on the DVD are personable and good at what they do.  This DVD does not teach any of this, it just gives me a backing band to put my learning to use!",1464220800,3,756,3.8451612903225807

8754266,3,B01CUVPPO2,"This DVD is made for people who already know how to play. There is no instruction whatsoever, so if that's what you're looking for you need to look elsewhere.
That being said, if you have a guitar, know how to play, but have no one to play with this video can provide the illusion of practicing with a band. The plus side of that is you can experiment and make mistakes without embarrassment because there's no one there to hear them but you.",1489622400,,442,4.337349397590361
