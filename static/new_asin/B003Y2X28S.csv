8408613,1,B003Y2X28S,"This is a repackage of the original RF Video Shoot Video DVD with the Highspots logo on the DVD cover and on the screen during the first part of the interview... with the RF Video banner hanging in the back of Billy Jack.  This is NOT a different interview.  Very disappointed as I was expected a different shoot interview.  The interview and quality is good, but if you already have the original RF Video DVD, DON'T BUY THIS AS YOU ARE JUST GETTING A DUPLICATE DVD.",1504569600,,466,4.395348837209302
