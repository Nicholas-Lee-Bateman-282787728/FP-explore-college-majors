8146501,5,B000INBFSA,Would like more DVD's about Sloths. They are my favourite animal. My wish is to go and live with the Sloths :),1377388800,,110,4.045454545454546
8146502,5,B000INBFSA,"If you are a ""sloth enthusiast"", like me, you should most definitely buy this. Even the DVD menu page features some super adorable footage of sloths doing their low-key sloth thang. The program itself highlights historical info about sloths, present day sloths and a little bit about the detrimental effects man has had on their habitat and ecosystem.  It is upbeat and focuses mostly on charming sloths and facts about them. It's great if you're looking for a some general knowledge and cute footage.  Honestly there aren't many stand alone videos about sloths, and the quality and production value is good.  You should totally buy this.

If you like sloths,  I would also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Little-Book-of-Sloth/dp/1442445572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Little Book of Sloth</a>&nbsp;for it's gorgeous pictures.",1363392000,4,882,6.080645161290323
8146503,1,B000INBFSA,"I would like to return this brief, disjointed DVD.  I saw a half hour show on sloths on Animal
Planet which was excellent.  I thought this was the same program.  While the title is great,
it is an amateur effort.",1359331200,2,212,4.25
8146504,5,B000INBFSA,"Surprisingly enough, I didn't buy Hanging with the Sloth for a child. I bought this film, half jokingly, for my girlfriend, who completely obsesses over sloths. We watched it together and afterwards felt like experts on the sloth. It is easily the most entertaining animal documentary out there, and it won't be something we put on the shelf and never watch again. Sloths are so adorable and I was very relieved that there is a rescue center for them in the southern North/South American islands.",1310428800,7,496,4.847058823529411
8146505,4,B000INBFSA,"I love sloths and decided this dvd was too funny to pass up. But, with that said, I feel like I should have gotten more for my money in terms of the film's run time. Only 30 minutes long! I can see how it would be great for kids for educational purposes, and it isn't easy to find, but it was somewhat pricey. It was very informative and cute and fun to watch. I think educators should definitely show this to children to promote awareness of the importance of these adorable creatures, as well as wildlife conservation.",1286236800,8,520,4.371134020618556
