1627909,5,B00005MM7B,"It's true, it doesn't have quite the action and hand-to-hand of 'other classics' like, i.e., The Kid with The Golden Arm, but you have to own this title anyways, or you're just posing.
The movie is different from those 'other classics' in that it's hero is more of a 'real' person than the hero in those 'other classics'.  He can't kick your head off, and he can't whip his ponytail through your torso (which _is_ a weak point of this movie, I'll grant you), but he loves his wife and son, he's a good, moral man who is deeply disturbed by the situation in which he finds himself.
This movie has extremely rapid plot development, and the viewer can feel how the young protagonist is swept up by the pace of developments - fueled by the impatience of the godlike Emperor.  The Emperor summons you to his palace.  Of course you go, dropping everything instantly, because this man can have your whole city burned if he had a bad bowel movement that morning.
Your new life is to live at the palace and study to master a new weapon.  Should you manage to complete the ultra-demanding training, you will be the Emperor's Special Ops forces, used to kill traitors.  It's a huge honor, involves major prestige to your whole family, and mondo cash.
During the blur of the intense training, you are awakened after even less sleep than usual, with a veritable parade of courtiers who convey the will of the Emperor: it's time to put that training to the test.
You hustle off in the middle of the night, and one of you kills the appointed target.
Later, at an interlude in the training, it becomes clear that the victim was a 'good guy'.  It must have been a mistake, right?  No way the Emperor could be wrong, right?  It becomes clear that even such discussion amongst the troops reaches the ear of the Emperor, and paranoia mounts.  Disobedience is instant death, the walls have ears, and there are jealousies and tensions as strong undercurrents threatening to destabilize an already tenuous position stressed by a power-mad Emperor.
Another mid-night mission, and the target is another 'good guy'.  The fine, upstanding men recruited are morally at odds with the will of the Emperor, and cracks appear in their committment.  The troops are divided along moral lines.
Now, one of the evil troopers receives a clandestine mission, and his target is one of the more vocal troops in opposition to the murder.
The pressure is intolerable, the situation explodes, and the hero breaks loose from the now hopelessly corrupt group.
He is hunted, but survives each encounter because he was the best of the group, and because he is helped by a woman who falls in love with him.
They mangage to avoid capture, but eventually are found, and the climactic battle ensues.
I loved this movie, although the score occasionally makes you long for deafness.
Watch it for the history behind the sequel (which is not really a sequel): The Master of the Flying Guillotine, which has none of the plot development, intrigue, or drama, but has the lethal ponytails and blitzkreig action.

1627910,4,B00005MM7B,"Chen Kwan Tai stars as an up and coming soldier trained in the skill of deploying the newly created ""flying guillotine.""  The actual device is thrown in the air attached to a rope.  The device lands on your head like a iron hat, a series of blades fall from the brim to the victim's neck.  By pulling back on the device skillfully, the device decapitates its victim.  The story of the origination and development of the device is extremely well executed and the story takes itself all so seriously.  What sounds like a campy B-movie is actually a compelling drama.  When Kwan Tai develops reservations about using the device against rebel factions, he is labeled a traitor, and he retreats to the farmland...until the baddies track him down in the final showdown (a la Harrison Ford's ""Witness"").  Now while the movie is captivating in the sheer concept of the guillotine and it is startlingly gruesome to see the first several beheadings,  AFTER the first several beheadings, the story seems to have very little else place to go.  Therefore in the middle reels, the story bogs down with Kwan Tai leading the simple life, etc.  There is very little if any hand-to-hand fighting in this movie--- the weapon of choice here being the flying guillotine.  Having said that, there really is no climactic inventive extended guillotine vs. guillotine final showdown.

Unfortunately this movie falls flat on this. I had high hopes when they first invented the flying guillotine, but I thought the rest of the movie was pretty boring. I don't even recall many fight scenes at all. The build up to the end was very undramatic and even the grand finale fight scene left you asking where the REAL grand finale was.

I'm usually always pleased with the product coming from Dragon Dynasty, but I was a little disappointed that this DVD didn't contain any special features.  The story plot was pretty interesting though which involved the Emperor's commissioning of a special assassination squad to eliminate any political opposition towards his rule.  Pretty soon it begins to all go south when one of the assassins' question the Emperor's motives and he then later decides to call it quits.  Well that's a ""no no"", and soon the rebel is fleeing from his former comrades who've been ordered to hunt him down and kill him.

The dubbing sucks, & any other viewer who feels this is a Shaw-Brothers Classic are sadly mistaken!! First let me state for the record, THIS IS NOT! THE ORIGINAL!! The original Flying Guillotine was an Assassin!! There wasn't a group of men running around with Guillotines!!! In fact there were two Gulliotine movies, The Flying Guillotine & The Return Of The Flying Guillotine! This one here, even though it has the same title, This Is Not The Original!!

This Is Not The One!! I'm sorry I can not afford you the original actors of the Original, but do your own research & you will agree!! Can't say the previous reviewers know what there saying, but this is PURE GUILLOTINE FLYING GARBAGE!!

1627968,4,B00005MM7B,"This is another Shaw Brother historical fiction flick about Manchurian Emperor Yong Zheng's personal army of trained assassins known as the Flying Guillotin Troupe.

Yong Zheng was one of the Ching Dynasty's more capable rulers who restored peace stability and even prosperity to China but who achieved this by ruthlessly executing anyone suspected of spreading sedition or who were responsible for causing political unrest in the country.

To get rid of dissent in the ranks and any dissenting members of his family or ministers, he ordered one of his senior captains to set up a specially trained team of secret royal enforcers or assassins. This team came up with an unusual weapon called the flying guillotin which enabled them to mete out beheadings from 100 paces away.

There are no records of what the flying guillotin looked like but it is surmissed to have been a kind of razor sharp lasso type weapon which a trained assassin could  throw from a 100 paces and once the lasso was secured round the victim's neck one pull of the chain would tighten the razor sharp 'noose' and the victim's head severed.

Here we see how the weapon is invented and the training of the first team of assassins. Focus is then on one team member called Ma Teng played by real kungfu action star Chen Kwan Tai(star of ""Boxer from ShangTung"", ""Heroes Two"",""Challenge of the Masters"", ""The Blood Brothers"",""The Teahouse"",""Executioners from Shaolin"",""The Master"", ""Crippled Avengers"", ""Killer Constable"" and the original ""Iron Monkey"").

Ma Teng is the most adept at using the flying guillotine but is soon disenchanted when he discovers the team is being used for political murders rather than to protect the Emperor against terrorists as he was formerly led to believe.

Things come to a head when Ma Teng's colleague and friend (played by Johnny Wang Yu from ""Spiritual Boxer"", ""Executioners from Shaolin"", ""Dirty Ho"" and ""The Lady is Boss"")is assassinated on the Emperor's orders after the latter had suffered a nervous breakdown and was heard shouting his objections to helping the Emperor commit murder against innocent people.

Ma Teng secretly leaves his team, marries and settles down as a farmer faraway from the Capital. Meanwhile the Emperor puts a price on his head and sends the Guillotin troupe after him.

As one expects from a Shaw Bro action movie, Ma Teng is forced into a show down with his own team mates to protect his wife and new born son.

Full of flying guillotin decapitations and duels between Ma Teng and his ex-colleagues, there is less hand to hand kungfu combat or not enuff for me anyway hence I've only awarded this classic 4 stars outta 5.

The chop-sockey is old school, the evil emperor is so busy being evil that one has to wonder how he finds the time to run his empire, and the engineering... ah, she is the key to the beauty of this film.

Could the Flying Guillotine work? Well, not the one in this movie (presumably inspired by the actual Chinese weapon which translates most closely to ""blood dripper""), but the scenes in which the inventors devise their weapons are simply fantastic: you can sorta kinda see the wheels turn in their minds as they wander about, observing phenomena which inspire them to invent new things to detach people's heads.

It started a series with Master of the Flying Guillotine coming soon after. It's true that this Hong Kong franchise was just another shameless money-making enterprise, but it's influence on mainstream American filmmaking cannot be denied. Culturally, these films carried an impressive blend of folktale and proletarian values that are very near to the Chinese way of thinking. The bloody revenge seeking working-class heroes personified a kind of wish-fulfilment on the part of the Hong Kong movie-goer. With the British controlling the Chinese Port it became a characteristic of the populace to want to see Justice doled out aginst the odds. What better weapon to fight the Industrialisation of the European infestation but the ancient Martial Arts. A weapon from distant, traditional, near mythic times fed nostalgia and fueled the desires of a movie-going public that wanted to excorcise the bloodied changes brought about by the Hybrid British Colonisers by reflecting it in their forms of entertainment.
