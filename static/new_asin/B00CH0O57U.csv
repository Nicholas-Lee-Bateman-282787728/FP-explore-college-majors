8581666,5,B00CH0O57U,"In this video, Mike Dooley talks about how he got his ""second start"" after his t-shirt business failed. He talks about the ""baby steps"" someone has to take to make their manifestations come true. I highly recommend it. I got more out of his story then most other law of attraction videos.",1418688000,2,288,4.5576923076923075
