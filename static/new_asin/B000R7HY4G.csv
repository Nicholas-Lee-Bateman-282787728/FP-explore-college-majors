8199082,5,B000R7HY4G,The movie is great on the life of Billy Martin with the Yankee years. He had the greatest mind for baseball.  I've watched it many times. Well worth the money.,1298246400,,159,4.3
8199083,5,B000R7HY4G,Watching this DVD gives one a deep appreciation for how good of a manager Billy Martin was.  Suffering in Milwaukee with the Brewers reveals how much a talented manager can in fact bring to a ball club.  You were and will always be #1 Billy.,1246406400,,241,4.333333333333333
8199084,5,B000R7HY4G,"This was filmed shortly before Martin died and it was intended to be lessons about baseball, of which he shares many, and not necessarily an encompassing video of his career, manager or player. I highly doubt that he could have obtained the rights to the footage of his classic dirt kicking and fights with umpires and Reggie.

This film is introduced by Micky Mantle in an elegiac fashion due to its completion right after Billy's death.

Most of the film is Martin talking the nuts and bolts and stories of his time in baseball as a manager and player. If you are a true baseball fan you will love this as I do. He discusses his tenure as a player and how he swiftly moved up the ranks in coaching due to his baseball acumen. This IS THE REAL Billy Martin! That's worth the price of admission alone.

The last section of the video is dedicated to former players and managers talking about playing for and against him. It is very touching. It's worth the buy just to see Ricky Henderson cry from his love of Martin.

Star players and managers, Billy Martin talking baseball, and a tribute. This is about the man, not ""The Bronx Is Burning.""

If only Billyball were still being played today.

8199085,2,B000R7HY4G,As a Yankee fan as well as a fan of Billy Martin I found this video very disappointng. There were no videos of Martin kicking dirt or screaming at Reggie Jackson nor were there any of his early playing days with Mantle or Ford. It was basically just him talking about teamwork and how he admired Casey Stengal. All well and good but as far as this being a 'must' have for Martin fans this is a 'I can miss it'. Very disappointing for any Martin fan looking for footage of Martin going nuts yelling at umpires which should have been included.,1200009600,4,541,4.313725490196078
8199086,4,B000R7HY4G,"I was only a kid in New York when all this magic happened.
My beloved wife gave me the perfect gift from one of the greatest managers of all time.

Billy judged players by heart...we can all learn something from this.",1199750400,,217,4.2926829268292686
8199087,3,B000R7HY4G,"I got it for my husband. He is a big NY fan. He really liked The Bronx is Burning so I got him this too. He seemed to enjoy it. I thought it was OK, not as entertaining as the Bronx is Burning, but had lots of good info.",1199750400,,220,3.510204081632653
