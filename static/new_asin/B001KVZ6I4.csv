8316221,5,B001KVZ6I4,This was my favorite show on CW and I really would like to be able to purchase it on DVD.  I was terribly heart broken when they canceled it and it needs to be made available to own.  I can't even find anywhere to buy it digitally.  At least make it available on-demand like some of the other series out there.,1379980800,,310,4.049180327868853
8316222,5,B001KVZ6I4,"This show had a great cast and it was very entertaining. Why was it cancelled? At least if it was on DVD i could watch it again.  I looked for it on youtube but i could only find parts of the episodes,,,",1318204800,2,203,3.8333333333333335
8316223,5,B001KVZ6I4,"This was one of my all time favorite shows. I looked forward to it every week, it was a treat! Joanna Garcia's performance was Perfect. The story lines were compelling, the characters beautiful, but still interesting. The writing was great, very realistic and clever. I loved so many of the characters and really wanted to see what was going to happen next. Soooo, so sad it got cancelled. I will definitely buy the DVDs when they become available. Please let it be soon!!",1301097600,9,472,4.698795180722891
8316224,5,B001KVZ6I4,How long do we have to wait for this to become available? I loved this series and want to buy DVDs of the season to give as gifts. C'mon!,1289606400,12,137,3.7586206896551726
8316225,5,B001KVZ6I4,"This show may be the most, AWESOME show out there on the CW! Well, it's better than most of the shows out there. JoAnna Garcia, Ashley Newbrough, Lucy Hale, and Kristina Apgar, really got me laughing, and interested in the show. I miss it a lot, and I really wish ratings were higher, and that DVD's would come out. I like how Garcia plays a character who tutors 2 sisters. Never thought she would play that kind of character, but it's pretty cool. LET'S HELP A SECOND SEASON AIR!",1242345600,18,480,4.404494382022472
