8280909,5,B001B157CI,"This is a great instructional dvd. The extremities are so important, our legs hold us up and our arms are always moving. However, I find that in my earlier years as a therapist and all the therapists I've known, the legs and arms just kinda get brushed by. There usually is no detail work, we're always just focusing on the back.

The techniques I've learned from this let me do more, and in turn my clients notice. I look more educated and professional, because I am.
It's also important to understand that pain can come from a place where is isn't. I've found pain coming from the legs and arms that my client didn't feel, but was directly effecting their back.

I purchased all 3 of Meade Steadman's Deep Tissue Massage videos and like all of them, I'd recommend getting them as a set.

I'd recommend this strongly.",1444521600,,818,4.513513513513513
8280910,5,B001B157CI,"The owner of the spa that I work at had all of the staff take some time to review this and some other videos by this company, and this one was especially helpful. I never formally learned much on how to do massage for the extremeties, and as a massage therapist, it is extremely important for me to seek out educational materials and massage techniques to better my craft and increase my knowledge base.

This training video is not only well made and professionally filmed, but the instructor does a great job of walking you through the techniques. I'm not the fastest learner, but I had an easy time picking up the techniques used for applying deep tissue massage to the extremities, and it has been a pleasant addition to the treatments of my deep tissue massage clients. I have gotten great feedback on my new skills, and I'm thrilled to say that this massage DVD had a huge part in helping me cultivate my skills. This series is really helpful for anyone who wants to dive into massage therapy and develop their techniques.",1430265600,2,1027,4.581521739130435
