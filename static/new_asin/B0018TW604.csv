8271143,5,B0018TW604,"Bob Wilbanks' narration of ""The Brittany Today"" gives Bob Burchett's Iowa kennel of Brittany's well deserved praise. Burchett raises both field trial and close hunting Brittany's and if you don't know the difference then this DVR is a great investment. The DVR shows the evolution of the Brittany in America from the 1920s till today.

I have to admit my bias toward Britt's, as I first owned one in 1987 after wanting one as a teenager of the 60s watching the legendary Curt Gowdy hunt behind Brittany's on the television show, American Sportsman. I find the Brittany to be a great hunting dog and an excellent companion dog. In fact this DVR points out that Brittany's are people dogs that aim to please, are easily trained and when raised as a member of the family adapt well.  Brittany's work close to a hunter and are full of energy which in today's hunting habitat is a ""twofer."" Grouse and woodcock habitat demands getting into rough country but close enough to know the whereabouts of the dog. My wife and I both have Britt's that check back in frequently and in the heavy grouse cover of West Virginia that is a bonus.

Every would be dog owner should research the breeds they are interested in and videos such as this easily provide such a tool. I give this video to friends who talk about getting a Brittany so that they know exactly what they are getting themselves into and what to honestly expect from the dog.

Stamina, desire, a need to hunt and to be a part of the family. That is all any Brittany today wants out of life. Five Stars for ""The Brittany Today.""",1387238400,,1576,4.538732394366197
