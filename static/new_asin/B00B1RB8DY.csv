Warner Archive has once again done a magnificent job of remastering - the sound quality is crystal clear and the film quality is sharp and beautiful. The single-sided DVD is of good quality as well as the sturdy case.
First rate reproduction and well worth the price.
The movie itself is highly enjoyable - William Boyd shines as usual with an excellent supporting cast to interact with him. The plot is very good, never fast paced yet it progresses nicely. Highly recommended.",1443225600,2,560,4.783505154639175
8561044,5,B00B1RB8DY,"I bought this Double Feature because it was my only option to purchase ""Men of America"" at this time.  William ""Bill"" Boyd is a star in Men of America and my favorite actor of all time.  Absolutely loved the story.  Dorothy Wilson and William Boyd have great chemistry between them as love interests and both are fine actors. This movie provides my first introduction to Charles ""Chic"" Sales and he's fantastic as well. So is Director Ralph Ince who also acts in this movie. The story is multi faceted, well paced and every single actor performs his/her part perfectly.  I've watched Men of America more times than I can recall and every time there seems to be another detail to discover and thoroughly enjoy.  Rest assured I'll be viewing this movie again and again in the future!

I cannot make any comment good, bad or otherwise on Roar of the Dragon simply because it is not the type of movie I enjoy.",1424649600,4,905,4.555555555555555
