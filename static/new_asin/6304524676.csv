7873532,5,6304524676,"I first saw this one in 1997 on The Discovery Channel.  It presents a chronological compilation of the European colonization and genocide against Native Americans from Columbus to the present day.  This is the only documentary about the conflict between Europeans and Native Americans that presents a clear, balanced, and fair analysis of the events that began in 1492 and continue even today.  ""War Against The Indians"" presents a disturbing look at North America's past and present history, but laces the story with messages of hope for the future.  Despite being a lengthy documentary, it is highly entertaining as well as very informative, and features such famous Native American entertainment figures as Graham Greene and Russel Means (to name a couple).  You should plan on watching it from start to finish, because you WILL want to.  This one is a must for those with ties to or interest in Native American culture, society, and history.  I strongly encourage college and university students taking Native American history classes to get this one and learn the REAL history.",1102982400,8,1082,5.113636363636363
