8249523,4,B00139XUT0,"OK Blue Demon Spanish-language, Mexican-made (no-subtitles) action adventure.  This time he goes against a group of women and men and their mysterious leader who are intent on controlling the world.  Has some of the same actors from Blue Demon contra Los Cerebros Infernales.  I ordered the Zima Entertainment DVD release and it is very good quality.  Recommended for Blue Demon fans.",1420675200,,384,5.245901639344262
