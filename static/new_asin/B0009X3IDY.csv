8068824,1,B0009X3IDY,"Deplorable lame waste of time. Tacky, outdated actors/participants were alienating to watch. For the duration of the entire film, I repeatedly said to the screen, ""Who on earth does not already realize these concepts?""
I truly cannot fathom what the out-of-touch, oddball, clueless person looks like, who would gain any insight whatsoever from this dreadful waste of time and effort.",1375056000,,383,5.4
8068825,4,B0009X3IDY,"This is shocking & mundane at once, so normal seeking more pleasure, security & image, that normal Americans can watch & not realize how popular life is addictive & aging fast for ever more style & rescue by medicine.  I was hooked on the ever tasty treadmill getting fatter until loosing job teaching PS PE in '69.  Affluenza looks cute like satire, but deadly serious consumerism
diseases.  LIke many exposes it dares to describe/show details of over abundance of goodies on credit & fast clean living.  Then wondering why kids are rebelling &or depressed after school & complains, but who sees & listens to the kids wanting & consuming styles, taste & techy toys like parents they copy, or rebel to escape &or prove its all wrong?  Like most brainwashed citizens born in hospitals imprinted with big science medicine, victim consumers wonder why getting sick or depressed.  Like divorced unaware of their natural needs for healthy living food, Mother Nature equality & organic instincts banned from schools, malls & hospitals.  Affluenza is hot & boring expose of sickening habits, from normal brainwashing.  I suffered 27 years of normal toys, games & compulsive tasting & toxic medicine to relieve the pain, till Nature called me.  Seeing popular 'Affluenza' fills cities of diseased slow dying in style, wondering what's the real causes of problems, ills, conflicts & failing to buy happy?  After forgetting Mother Nature is still calling us to inner child spirit now realizing how dumb & numb Affluenza rewards good consumers of taste.",1346889600,3,1542,5.059288537549407
8068826,1,B0009X3IDY,"I thought I would love this award-winner, but the film itself (made in the mid 90s) was REALLY outdated. People were using computers from what appeared to be 1980, the clothing/acting during scripted moments was cheesy, and a good deal of the 'documentary' dealt with conservative religious groups and their views on shopping/family. While this is okay, I found the more recent and funny (and actually much less religious) film _What Would Jesus Buy?_ a better and more entertaining view on the same subject. I rarely give bad reviews on here, but this film is a turkey. It is not even worth showing to a classroom of students (h.s. or college), since it is outmoded and corny. I think the subject is really important and I applaud this films' initial creation, but it has become...""obsolete"" in the face of newer, fresher, and more...detailed...documentaries.",1320969600,4,860,5.020979020979021
