7796738,5,1566916488,"Although an older set from 2000 to 2003, Rick Steves always has great travel videos.  And this 5 DVD set even had one DVD with countries like Bulgaria & Croatia that might not originally been of interest; yet he shares so many exciting places & points of interest, that he'll lead you to become interested.  Plus there are extras like travel tips & an insightful interview with Rick.  He chronicles his story & how he began his love for travel, resulting in his career as a travel writer/tour guide.  There are a total of 15 hrs. in these 5 DVDs.  But its nice because you can stop them at any time, & later watch them without missing a ""beat"".  It just picks up with his next country visit or travel site. For the arm-chair traveler; it's a wonderful (& cheap) trip.  Hope to watch one from the Asian countries or from all the Islands someday.  Thanks for my world tour, Steve!!",1271894400,3,879,4.416149068322981
7796739,1,1566916488,"First, I bought Rick Steves ""France and Benelux"" for $30. Later I bought Rick Steves ""All 30 Shows"" for $79 (Guess what: The $30 ""France and Benelux"" DVD was a part of the ""All 30 Shows"".)  Keep reading: It gets more expensive.  Then I noticed that Rick Steves ""All 70 Shows"" was available for the same price as the ""All 30 Shows""--$79. (Guess what: The ""All 30 Shows"" was included in the ""All 70 Shows."")  Keep reading: It gets more expensive.  So I now have $190 invested in 3 sets.  I ""ate"" the $30 for the first set and sent back the $79 second set of ""All 30 Shows"".  I was charges $45.00 for shipping and restocking.  So, lets do the math:  I invested $188 to get a $79.00 set (minus the refund of $35.00).  My two E-mails to Amazon have been met with the same answer: This is not the proper site to deal with this matter.",1196899200,,828,4.189873417721519
