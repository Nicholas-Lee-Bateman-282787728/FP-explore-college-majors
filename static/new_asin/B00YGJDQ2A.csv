8718254,5,B00YGJDQ2A,"This is probably one of the most insanely expensive DVD purchases I've ever made (original cost: 7,960 JPY) but this concert was by far my favorite out of all the concerts that SHINee has done in their career so far and it's easy to understand why when you see the stadium of 50,000 fans. This edition includes a beautiful photobook and almost the entire concert (some talk segments are shortened but all the songs I think are there including solos - doesn't include the song fans sing during the break before the encore T__T). The camera work for this concert was really well done too. As a fan, I really couldn't find any faults with this concert dvd. I highly recommend it if you're a Shawol.",1449792000,4,695,4.523809523809524
