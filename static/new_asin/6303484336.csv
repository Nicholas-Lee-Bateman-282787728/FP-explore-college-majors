This movie cries for widescreen due to the aspect ratio.  Come on studios, let's get it together!  Mark Hamil is going to get in his car and follow you until you do.",1436227200,,291,4.254545454545455

 It is old but the picture is good although it is not on dvd.
 Was intrested in seeing it since I am Security Guard at the hospital and intresting to see where they filmed in the hospital as well as other places.
 Good movie.

The movie kept my attention the whole way through, without any boring lapses in the plot.  Lots of action and a bit creepy without a lot of gore.  The movie ended a little abruptly, but I still loved it.  And Mark Hamill makes the sexiest psychotic killer I've ever seen!",1145923200,,375,4.455882352941177
7848568,1,6303484336,"Okay, I didn't see the whole movie, but I saw enough.

The only reason I even want to comment about it is: I love incredibly bad lapses in time and space in incredibly bad movies.  You know, like when Sylvester Stallone pulls a monstrous gun out at a firing range and obliterates a paper target with a single shot.  The bullet would have to be the size of his torso to do that kind of damage TO A SHEET OF PAPER!

Well, I think I saw that in MIDNIGHT RIDE at the very end.  Look closely as the hero dispatches the villian with a single gunshot to the forehead.  There's a giant bloody hole in his back between the shoulder blades when he hits the floor.

That basically means that a .38 bullet entered the forehead and exploded out of the back like a Howitzer shell.  Talk about a magic bullet!

Yeah, baby!",1105056000,,807,4.222222222222222
7848569,5,6303484336,"I can't imagine anyone driving around nowhere at midnight and then pick up a hitchhiker! Dementia! A police officer (Michael Dudikoff) wants to make amends with his bitter wife (some woman), but she doesn't want to reconcile. She goes on a happy time ride at midnight trying to get away from Lawson. She's so happy, she picks up a hitchhiker who ends up being Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)! He must've went crazy because of the direction his career went. Just like the wife with no future. This movie will make you think about riding at night. I never will after seeing this genius shocker! Please put this on DVD right now! It redefines dismay with Dudikoff! Pure genius.",1044144000,,671,4.694915254237288
