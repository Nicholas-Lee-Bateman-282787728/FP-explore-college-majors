8413902,5,B0042SKGJ6,"This box set includes the complete series plus some fun extras like a DVD puzzle made from the sleeves.  You will need a multi-region DVD player.

If you order from www.amazon.de the box-set includes the original English soundtrack.  However, the titles and menu are in German--but you won't have much trouble navigating it.  The sub-titles are, of course, optional.

However, it is just not right for this to be sold at $500.  You can order this directly at http://www.amazon.de/Komplettbox-Episodenguide-Autogrammkarte-Puzzle-Poster-Karton-Sleeves/dp/B009EOYTXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360690112&sr=8-1  They ship to the United States.  You just use your same log-in as you do in the U.S.---it works across all platforms.

The cost?  27 Euros or about $36.  But they take off 15% Value-added-tax for shipments to the U.S.: price $31.  Shipping: approximately $6.

Be sure to call your credit card company beforehand and tell them that a charge will show up in Germany and that that is okay.",1360627200,5,992,5.577181208053691
8413903,5,B0042SKGJ6,"I think the Cybill series and Reba's TV series are two of my very favorite TV comedies.  Buying all of the Reba seasons here in the U.S. was never an issue; for some unknown reason, only a limited number of Cybill episodes have been released that are compatible with U.S. DVD players. I haven't seen Cybill on TV reruns in a few years and I missed it, so I decided to buy The Complete Collection, which has all four seasons.  For the complete series, which I bought on Amazon's UK site, rather than here, you do need a Region 2 compatible DVD player.  Players that we typically have in our homes here in the U.S. will not work with a Region 2 disc.

I love the humor that Cybill and Marianne (Christine Baranski) share on this show.  It's very witty and clever, it gets me laughing out loud.  The crazy things that they come up with to do to Dr. Dick, ex-husband of Marianne are hysterical and very creative.  Cybill's ex-husbands still hang around and in the first season, husband #2 is still trying to get back togeher with Cybill.

Now for the equipment needed to watch The Complete Collection - a multi-region DVD player that plays Region 2 is what you need.  DVD players typically sold in the U.S. only play Region 1 DVDs.  After reading all the reviews on  supposed multi-region DVD players - a lot of them tend to be in the $50 range - it seemed a lot of reviews saying configuring them to play region 2 was difficult or didn't work.

Based on positive reviews for a more expensive player, I bought the ""Pioneer DV-610AVE PAL Multiformat DVD, SACD Player with HDMI and USB Host"" for $102 here on Amazon. I didn't even have to tinker with any setup for playing DVDs from other regions. I couldn't even find a place in their setup menu to make region settings - it wasn't necessary. I put in a Region 2 DVD (I lives in the States) and it fired up and played it beautifully. Very nice player, very vivid colors. I can finally watch my complete box set of the Cybill series!",1334361600,12,1977,4.371584699453552
