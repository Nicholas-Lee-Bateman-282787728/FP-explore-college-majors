1658713,5,B00005T30G,I haven't actually seen the DVD of this yet but I did just see episode two on Cartoon netwoks Adult Swim. This looks to be an excellant series. The animation is beautifully done and the story line includes humor and drama. I will warn you though this is a long series. I have looked into buying the subtitled DVDs and found to my astonshiment/horror/pleasure that this series is currently 112 episodes long. Just so you don't have to do the math that means that if this series is released with 4 episodes per disk this series will cover 28 DVDs!! The import subtitled stuff has 9 or 10 episodes per disk with a total of 12 DVDs. That also means that it will take at least a year or two for the entire release of this series.,1015200000,4,724,4.291970802919708
1658715,4,B00005T30G,"I think it`s at least the funniest anime show I`ve seen yet, if not one of the best. At first it comes off as being kind of cheesy, and maybe it is, but what makes up for that are the constant moments of clashing humor. But as well as having comedy, the series can be surprisingly clever, thoroughly entertaining, and even moving. I was surprised by a couple episodes that almost made me cry. The story really does give you a feeling of hope and good-triumphing-over-evil and all that stuff.",1042675200,,491,4.466666666666667
1658716,5,B00005T30G,"One of the best (and older) animes that has been dubbed.  Sometimes Yusuke can be a *bit* dangerous, and I would suggest kids under 10 shouldn't watch this 'cause of Minor violence and langague. But It's too funny to pass up.",1040774400,,225,4.487804878048781
1658717,5,B00005T30G,"ok. i'm never a big fan of anime, what with pokemon and all. but this anime is the best i have ever seen. like everyone else is saying, Yu Yu Hakusho has something for everybody. Action, comedy, and just enough romance so that guys won't throw up over all of the mushy stuff! so if you are a fan of action flicks, or like a little bit of comedy with your little bit of action, then you won't be dissapointed with Yu Yu Hakusho!",1039305600,,427,4.095238095238095
1658718,5,B00005T30G,It really is one of the best anime series ever made. I really diddn't think it looked that good and I thought it was like DBZ but I was very wrong and I was so suprized at how good it really was. If u want a great anime then start with this fun first volume. This anime is a classic and one of my favorites.,1039046400,,307,3.7384615384615385
1658719,5,B00005T30G,"Ok this was very weird at first but it got more interesting in the next episodes. This is a cartoon you should take a look and collect. Yu Yu Hakusho is straight out Hilirious and romantic. These 4 episodes have alot of romance and some heart warming scenes, but to understand this series you have to watch the first 4 episodes to know why and how. If you like to watch anime that has everything like romance, comedy, fighting, betrail, curlity, or true friendship, and trust in one another. You will love this series it just has it all. And this doesn't have anything that looks the same like DragonBall Z. Cause you know in DragonBall Z everyone looks the same. They did a great job on the art work and found some great acters for the voices. So Take a look at this anime, cause it's worth taking a look.
See you Later anime fans.",1035504000,,832,4.339743589743589
1658720,5,B00005T30G,"I love Funimation! I know a lot of people automatically hate any and all dubs, but I believe Funimation's done a great job.  Nothing is really lost in the edited version, either, but for this first video, both versions are great. A must have.",1032393600,,242,4.5
1658721,5,B00005T30G,"Yu Yu Hakusho... a demented series... however, it's very entertaining.  The biggest troublemaker in his town, Yusuke Urameshi, is killed in a car accident, presented with an ordeal by guide Botan, to win his life back and having to depend on his rival, Kuwabara to keep his body in one piece.  Not good for a 14 year old to experience.  Plenty of comedy... Koenma, 700 years old, looks like a kid with `Jr.' on his hat and pacifier.
A great series... characters conveniently balanced.",1029715200,,484,4.738095238095238
1658722,3,B00005T30G,"After watching a few episodes on Cartoon Network's run of Yu Yu Hakusho, I decided to pick up the first DVD volume and give it a shot.  And for the most part, I'm very pleased with this purchase! And if you are wondering, this disc is uncut, and contains both an English and Japanese audio track. Yu Yu Hakusho (YYH) hasn't really presented itself as being a ground breaking so far, but what it does offer is some good characters in a variety of fun situations.  As with most series, the first few episodes introduce us to the characters and let us get to know the world they inhabit.
Of course, when the lead character dies in the first episode, you know something's up!  I won't go into the details of the story, but a synopsis is due.  Yusuke is somewhat of an outcast who doesn't really display a care for anything.  The only thing he seems good at is beating up on other middle school gangs.  But one day, he saves a kid from being hit by a car, only to have himself hit instead!  Now, our anti-hero lead is stuck between Heaven and Hell as a ghost since the higher beings don't know what to make of him.  He is then offered a chance to return back to life, which is all well and good, except that Yusuke doesn't really care to go back.  That is until he realizes how many people truly cared for him.  And so the tale unfolds.
YYH showcases a good mixing of several different genres; everything from fighting, supernatural and even some good old-fashion romance.  YYH also borrows some aspects heavily from Dragonball Z.  I personally do not care much for DBZ (though I do thoroughly enjoy the earlier part of Dragonball), but I found myself warming up a bit more to this series.
I found myself liking the character designs as they remind me of older series from the 80s.  A good break from the styles being pushed out these days.  The animation is fair, but since this is such a long running series, that can only be expected.  The palette of colors used is also pretty minimal and kind of drab.  But ultimately I'm in for the show, and not the eye candy.
As for the localization, I'd say it's pretty good.  I enjoy English dub tracks, so I didn't have a lot trouble adapting to this one.  Some of the characters, such as Yusuke, are well portrayed while others come off as too cartoony sounding (Kuwabara).  I should note that the actual recording job of the dub could of been handled a little more professionally.  Some of the dialog gets clipped slightly when things get loud, and there were also a few instances of microphone *puff* sounds.  FUNimation went the extra mile and dubbed the opening and closing songs, which is always a plus in my book.  And fear not, the original songs are present on the Japanese audio side.
The adapted dub script follows the original Japanese dialog fairly well, with only minimal changes here and there.  Thankfully, FUNimation included subtitles for both the English and the Japanese tracks (Most studios skimp out on subtitling the English track). But unfortunately, they aren't the best subs out there as they are white instead of the normal yellow. Alas, they are functional and well timed. Missing is a subtitle track devoted to translations of the onscreen Japanese writing, which is a real shame.
This disc features decent audio and video; it's not terrible, but nothing to write home about.  Depending on your equipment, you may or may not notice some of the macroblocking ""squishy"".  The disc also features some good extras.  For starters you get a clean (textless) opening and ending sequence in both English and Japanese.  The profiles do a good job of fleshing out a few characters without being riddled with spoilers. Although, they are annoyingly tilted at a 30 degree angle, making them difficult to read. Yama's Notebook is a welcome section that explains some of the Japanese meanings for names as well as translations for some of the kanji used in the show.  There are a few trailers for Dragonball related material, and one for Blue Gender.
So would I recommend this disc? Probably, but make sure you know what your getting into first.  While the DVDs are cheaper than most anime DVDs, you're also getting less content. The discs will be released with 4 episodes for the first few discs, then most likely drop down to 3.  With a series this long (over 100 episodes in total) that's going to require quite a commitment on your part.  Another problem with the length of the series is that there will no doubt be long drawn out stretches of lulls in the later episodes; something that turned me off with Dragonball Z. These first few episodes were good, but there's no telling where it'll  be by episode 50.
But hey, try out the first few volumes and form your own opinion.  What you think is far more important than any jaded reviewer :)",1019433600,12,4799,4.575438596491228
1658723,4,B00005T30G,"I'm really praying this American release lives up to it's greatness. YYH is a great anime. I have seen about 30eps fansubbed, and refuse to watch the Cartoon Network dubbed version. Though some might not quite get how the main character is dead from the start, it all works out. ^.^()
For the boys there's plenty of fighting, cursing, and some cute girl characters. For the girls, there's Kurama. He's a nice, polite, foxy (literally ^.^) bishonen. Oh yeah, and he still kicks butt - he just does it with roses.
Oh, and there's the one known as the ""Vegeta-wannabe"", Hiei. He's a fire demon with a big attitude problem.
And behind all the fights and tournaments each character's heart breaking past is shown. It's a little like DBZ - but the fights aren't as long and are certainly much cooler. And the style is more pleasing to the girls fans use to, say, Sailor Moon or Card Captors.",1017964800,5,885,4.572327044025157
7953256,5,B00005T30G,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1226,4.168776371308017
7953257,3,B00005T30G,"Life is hard, and then you die. If you're unlucky, like Yusuke Urameshi, then life gets harder AFTER you die.

In fact, death is only the beginning of his troubles in ""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found,"" which collects the first four episodes of this classic anime. The first few episodes are a bit difficult to get into, since the whole concept is being built up here (seriously, a whole episode about Kuwabara's schoolwork?), but it promises to get more entertaining later on.

Despite a reputation as a hardened rebel, Yusuke was killed knocking a toddler from the path of a moving car. Turns out the afterlife, aka Spirit World, didn't expect such a selfless act -- so Spirit World's toddler ruler Koenma offers him a second chance at life, with the help of the sprightly Grim Reaper Botan, an oar-riding girl who tries to keep Yusuke on the straight and narrow.

Initially, Yusuke refuses. But after seeing how the people around him are responding to his death -- including his rival Kuwabara and semi-girlfriend Keiko -- he agrees. But that's a lot easier said than done, since Koenma says he will have to hatch a Spirit Beast, which will be nurtured by his good intentions. But those good intentions involve plenty of danger -- including helping out Kuwabara, and trying to save his own body from a raging fire that might just kill him. As in, all the way-dead, to quote Miracle Max.

""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost, Yusuke Found"" is basically about setting up the premise of the entire TV show, and introducing about half of the main characters. Not to mention the funny concept of the afterlife, which is basically a giant office ruled by a toddler, with hordes of overworked cubicle ogres running around trying to deal with the phone calls and paperwork. It's the sort of thing that makes you want to live forever, especially if you've lived ""Office Space.""

And the plot starts off rather slowly, since the first half is essentially all about Yusuke floating around yelling at people, occasionally possessing Kuwabara (resulting in much trouble for them both) and helping the big friendly lug with his homework. For an action series, the non-comedic action is sparse. But things tighten up in the fourth episode, where Yusuke is forced to make a terrible decision -- his life, or the girl he adores. Guess what choice he makes.

It takes a little while to warm up to Yusuke, since he seems like a rebel without a cause despite his alcoholic single mum. But he becomes more likable as it's shown that he has a good heart underneath his tough-guy attitude. His thuggish-looking classmate Kuwabara makes an unexpected ally, since he turns out to have some very convenient psychic powers (or ""the tickle"" as he calls it), and Keiko is a suitably feisty love interest for Yusuke.

""Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke Lost Yusuke Found"" is a rather bland opening for his classic anime series, but the good news is that it picks up considerably after this. And it's a necessary glimpse of the world it takes place in.",1234569600,,3012,4.736641221374046
7953258,5,B00005T30G,"Yu-Yu Hakusho... In early 2002, or so, I believe it was, maybe 2001, this show was aired on Adult Swim and Toonami, and though, they only showed 20 something episodes back then, they started showing up to the Dark Tournament sometime in 2004, I believe, maybe started mid 2003, but... Lol, my memory is fading, it seems. Anyway... I saw that they were releasing the Import boxset in English on a website, and so I bought 2 sets of it, containing episodes: 1-50 on 6 discs (uncut), which was great, but... It didn't end the Dark Tournament, then, back in 2004, they released a 3rd boxset, containing episodes: 51-78, which ended the Dark Tournament, and started the Chapter Black Saga. After witnessing all of the Dark Tournament, which is my favorite Saga in the Series, I REALLY began to love this show A LOT. I liked it before, but far from how much I love it now. At any rate, the Series' Storyline is superb, and the action is grand. So, the bottom line is: if you like action Anime, but not brainless, no reason violence, with an excellent Storyline, then, I suggest you give this Anime a try. T-O-G-U-R-O; Toguro, yes, Toguro. Man... Team Toguro -- Ultimate. As for my age rating for this Anime: 16+/R (Graphic Violence, Gore, Profanity, Sexual Situations, and Adult Complex Themes). One of the Animes tied in 2nd place for me.",1129507200,,1333,4.628691983122363
7953259,3,B00005T30G,"I was skeptical to how Funimation was gonna handle another anime series and not do another ""hatchet"" job.  Listening to the English track with the Japanese script , you can tell the show has been very ""kiddie-fied"" and cleaned up. Basically death, alcohol, and sex talk.  So I ended up going back to the Japanese track and was pleasently surprised. Great opening and closing tunes , as well as a solid storyline make this one a sure fire hit. Just stay away from the dub and edited versions.

Extras are lousy however. Whoopey, more DBZ saga previews with ludicrously overdone voiceovers compliments of Funimation.",1103155200,,614,4.884615384615385
7953260,5,B00005T30G,"I am pissed. For not knowing about Yu Yu Hakusho until March 27, 2004. I have been missing out for years not knowing about this great anime series. This is my only and first Yu Yu Hakusho DVD that I saw and it was the MOST entertaining anime that I had ever seen! This is one of the best or possibly THE BEST anime out there. You might not agree but if you take the time a look at this anime series, you will know what I exactly mean. This anime has a great story line. It's about a 14 year boy (forgot the name because I only had it for two days) who dies trying to save a kid from a car. Later, he realizes that he had became a ghost and has to do good in order to come back to life. I'm not going to go too much into the story. I thought the idea was great and the execution was even better. I only saw it four times but I really enjoyed it. At first, it was kind of hard to understand the story but after the second time, I started to get the story. You know, it's funny how those Japanese people come up with those crazy ideas for catoons and games (Prince of Mononoke, Spirited Away, Dragonball Z, Inu Yasha, Arc the Lad, Ranma, Street Fighters, Silent Hill, and Clock Tower just to name a few)  but this one is just totally amazing. I didn't enjoy an anime this mush since the first Pokemon days (after the Pokemon Journey, it got wierd). Well, at least now I know about Yu Yu Hakusho and I'm going to try to get all the DVD. I definitly recommend it and even though my review wasn't helpful, you should try renting it from a library, Hollywood Videos, or Blockbuster and then say something about my review.",1080432000,3,1614,4.0754716981132075
