8515060,1,B000WP0SEQ,"I will try to be as constructive as possible in my review so that i give everyone the true facts behind this pack:
1. No proper explination to technical indicators used in this pack, the instructor was advicing to use certain selective indicators over many available in the market, just because he believes these are the best.

2. Configuring MACD with certain given parameters was not supported by any evidences, ""i don't know why, don't ask me, but i tried it and it did work"" instructor explained. from an audiance side, this is not enough at all.

3. I have watched the 1st DVD and i can say that 90% of the illustrations used during the class was out of synch with his disucssion and explination. for example, Martin was explaining the RSI when he turns to chart you DONT see any pointer or marker or any mouse as to where he is pointing. This was the case of the 1st DVD, i really felt so disappointed to an extent that i did not want to continue the remaining pack.

4. The quality of the movies was not that so good, Jitter and out-of-synch between speech and sometime cutts was very notecible.

5. No discussion on chart trends, cndlesticks, no proper explination to most of the indicators used, why we have to use these over many others? i could not find any relevant information.

6. I hoped to see better explination on VXI, RSI, ROC in more depth as to why they should be configure with these parameters, but no luck.

7. The impact and calculation of interest rate and its reflection on overall stock market was not mentioned.

8. The relationship between Nasdaq Index 100 and NYSE and how to track and calculate their moving averages to see if the market is bullish or bearish was not there.

9. last but not least, if you really want to see the whole work of this pack in a cheaper price, buy the book ""12 Simple Indicators"" for the same author and am sure you will get exatly what is in this pack but rather than paying 799 US$ you would pay 36$ and you will get his DVD.

in my openion, there are MUCH more other material better than this one in the market worth fraction the price of this pack. for eg. ""Steve Nison and his 4 DVDs pack for Candlesticks"" excellent choice, also ""Gerrald Appel in his book ""Technical Analysis power tools for active investors"" this book work 1000 times the price of it, for those who red the book they've been alerted by now about the recent crisis in the world market.

Last but not least, this pack does not really worth the price of it, in my openion it should be priced way less than that.

have a nice reading and learning.
thanks",1201132800,20,2585,4.39832285115304
