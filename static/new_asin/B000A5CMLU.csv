8643487,2,B000A5CMLU,"A subtitle for this review should be ""Worthless VHS Tape and Misleading Title"".  Had a problem with the window in the convertible top of my 2005 VW New Beetle.  The rear glass window separated from the fabric top along the top and left and right sides of the rear glass, but was still securely intact at the bottom of the window.  Talked with VW technician and was told only solution was to replace top for about $3,500-4,000.  When I complained that vehicle was garage-kept and had only 34,000 miles on it, VW referred me to a reupholstery shop for their advice.  Received the same response from that shop--only solution was to replace top, with his price $1,800 to do the job.  Went on-line to get clues on possible repair of 2005 VW Beetle window in a convertible top.  Got several hits -- one was from a guy who said he repaired his window separation problem by using fast-set epoxy.  Another hit offered a VHS tape for $45 with the title:  ""New Beetle Convertible Top and Window Repair"".  Figured someone had come up with a solution that was effective and had made a video tape to demonstrate how to make the repair, since it is a common problem with VW New Beetle convertible tops.  Ordered the VHS tape on 28 September 2011; received an ""order has shipped"" alert from Amazon on October 3rd, with a delivery estimate of OCT 5 to OCT 21!, and it didn't arrive until over THREE WEEKS later on the last day of the estimated delivery range--OCT 21.  Nonetheless, I was delighted to receive it and anxious to make the repair, since car couldn't be driven with the rear glass separated from the fabric top.  The VHS tape was a highly technical presentation, done by VW technicians, and had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH REPAIRING THE WINDOW IN A NEW BEETLE CONVERTIBLE TOP.  Rather, it showed how to remove the top (never once referencing anything to do with the window supposedly heat-sealed into the top.  It also gave a technical series of steps to take in adjusting, repairing or removing the electrically operated SIDE WINDOWS of the vehicle.  I was disappointed and disgusted.  I purchased two types of fast-set epoxy and attempted the repair.  The first type did not hold.  The second -- LOCTITE EPOXY HEAVY DUTY High Strength Builders Formula -- worked great and it is holding just fine.  It's an awkward repair to make -- need to release the top a bit; place something behind back seat to provide solid support for rear glass window; a couple of helpers would be useful to help put pressure on fabric while epoxy sets and adheres to glass window (about 20 minutes); recommend using disposable latex gloves; removed excess epoxy with razor blade after it began to set up, but before it was completely cured.  Purchased the Loctite Epoxy from either Home Depot or Lowe's -- can't recall which stocked it.  An inexpensive repair.  After it was totally cured and the repair was as clean and neat as I could make it, I applied a bead of silicon windshield sealer just to ensure all was water tight.  It worked for me.  Good luck.",1320019200,60,3033,4.624299065420561
