8282553,2,B001BBH68Q,"What we have here is a collection of very seldom seem in the United States of action and war films from Italy and the Philippines. The problem is this collection of film prints, on two double-sided DVDs and one single-sided DVD, are taken directly from Greek, Japanese and VHS tapes from other countries, so while the language is English, you will have to put up with large Greek and Japanese subtitles while watching some of the titles. I liked most of the films, but VideoAsia is known as a bootleg company and very rarely takes their prints from actual film, rather using VHS prints instead (without the licencor's permission). Some of the films are barely watchable because of this, while other look pretty good, if you can put up with random video roll-outs and other VHS related problems. But if you want to see some bloody 1980's action films, 30% of them never released in the U.S., this is the only way to see them. It's up to you whether it is worth it or not. The films are:

1) TIGER JOE
2) WARBUS (My favorite in this collection)
3) MANNIGAN'S FORCE
4) STRIKE COMMANDO
5) OPERATION NAM
6) FIREBACK
7) SOLDIER OF FORTUNE
8) DEATH RAIDERS (from Indonesia)
9) RAIDERS OF THE LOST IVORY
10) LAST MERCENARY",1496620800,,1214,4.568807339449541

8282556,4,B001BBH68Q,"If you're looking for the finest action films the 1980s produced, you should probably look elsewhere. But if you want hours and hours of cheesy action entertainment, you need to buy this collection of off-brand pics that time (and the IMDB) forgot. Yes, the quality on some is certainly not crystal-clear, 1080p, hi-rez whatever, but, like the bad-asses contained in these movies, they get the job done. Highlights: Tiger Joe (an actual good movie) and the immortal Reb Brown's star turn in Strike Commando.",1373241600,,507,5.0476190476190474
8282557,5,B001BBH68Q,Has some really good movies in there I bought it mostly for Strike Commando but overall I am highly satisfied,1372636800,,109,4.5
8282558,5,B001BBH68Q,I've also finnished watching this. Been a busy weekend watching films. But not a moment was wasted with this. I really love all of the martial arts stuff that they have going on here. I'm totally amped up right now on this stuff. They had some really cool stuff in here. Definitely worth the time spent watching.,1226188800,8,312,4.491228070175438
8282559,3,B001BBH68Q,"It's frustrating when companies sell multi-title box sets and don't tell you what movies are included.  I haven't actually watched any of the movies in this set yet, but I have spot-checked them for quality, so this review is mainly to list the titles so you'll know what's in the set, and give you a basic idea of how they looked and what the run-times were.  If you've picked up any of Video Asia's other Grindhouse Presents sets, you'll already know that the quality's going to be shoddy, but it could be worth it if you want some obscure, mostly-Italian films at a budget price, and are old-school enough to not be too hung up on quality.  Or, if you just want to re-create the bad ol' days of grey-market VHS bootlegs, here ya go.  As long as you know what you're getting into beforehand, you should be okay with this. Titles in this set are mostly Italian films, and you can look them up on IMDB for plots and directors, etc.

1. Strike Commando (1 hr. 28 min.) Picture is about VHS quality, not terrible.

2. Mannigan's Force (1 hr. 23 min.) VHS picture quality, with burned-in Japanese subtitles.

3. Death Raiders (1 hr. 20 min.) VHS dub picture quality, with some very heavy videotape damage and tracking problems early on.

4. Operation Nam (1 hr. 21 min.) VHS picture quality.

5. Fireback (1 hr. 29 min.) VHS quality, some tracking problems.

6. Raiders of the Magic Ivory (1 hr. 24 min.) Sharp VHS quality but has burned-in Japanese subtitles

7. The Last Mercenary (1 hr. 29 min.) Looks like about 2nd generation VHS

8. Soldiers of Fortune (1 hr. 34 min.) This is the one with Daniel Greene in it.  Looks like a VHS, burned-in Japanese subs.

9. WarBus (1 hr. 20 min.) Quality is about 2nd or 3rd generation VHS.

10.  Tiger Joe (1 hr. 36 min.)  VHS quality, extremely letterboxed with a wide black base (possibly matted?), has burned-in Japanese subtitles.

That's it!  Hope this was helpful.",1225152000,40,1909,4.545454545454546
