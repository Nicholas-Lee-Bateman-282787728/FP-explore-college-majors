8324010,4,B000A7FTKE,"Savage Instinct is from AIP Studios, and features ridiculous action sequences & fight scenes, and plenty of laughs.  Susan Morris (Debra Sweaney) becomes the target of a gang of drug dealers while looking at real estate; the gang appears fearsome enough, but their attractive prey somehow becomes a killing machine, slinging axes & killing lotsa bad guys.....totally ridiculous & a fun watch if you're in the right frame of mind.  The vhs box is pretty hot & this will look swell on your video shelf.",1378598400,,500,4.870588235294117
