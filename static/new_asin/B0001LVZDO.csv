I wouldn't say it's a family movie due to some situations & some language going on,but almost there. She sings, act, play it hard in the game of life in order to survive & achieved her major goal...becoming a star!!!
It's a shame that this piece of good work haven't been release on dvd cause I bet it will sale!! & it will be the greatest investment to Yasmine's fans!!!",1199145600,4,460,4.238636363636363
8014187,5,B0001LVZDO,"Yasmine plays a street wise little girl who wants to be a star and is willing to do almost anything to make it. But she is also a very troublesome (is that a word?) [...] who often gets into trouble with authorities both on the street and at the orphanage where she lives. Soon she meets a man living in an old theatre (buddy hackett) who transforms the star want-to-be's attitude and outlook on life. But will she become a star? Of course I'm not going to tell you, but what I will say is that if you enjoy movies with a good plot and excellent cinematography(spelled right?)you'll want to own this insightful and entertaining movie.
Rise and Shine I gather is the Canadian version of the movie. Because in the USA it goes under the title BABE. Still there are no differences in them, no scenes cut out.
The movie is rated G in Canada, but it in no way is a G rated film, at least from my stand point. In one scene she does a very provocative strip tease for some boys at the orphanage for money, plus there is some saucy language and other tid bits that would, I'd guess put the movie in at least an PG rating here in the USA.
Still, all things considered, it is a very entertaining movie and one which can inspire anyone who feels they are at the bottom of the barrel to go for their goals.",1178496000,4,1293,4.217741935483871
