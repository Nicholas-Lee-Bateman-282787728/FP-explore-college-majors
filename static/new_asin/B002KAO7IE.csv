8590695,5,B002KAO7IE,"Seeing Doug Ferony in ""Doug Ferony: In Concert"" you can see the degree of fun Ferony and his tight big band are having presenting these songs to a lucky audience. Great tunes all the way through. Ferony glides along the stage, like a maestro of sorts. I recommend both this disc and his live performance itself.
