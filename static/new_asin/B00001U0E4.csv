1246493,1,B00001U0E4,"There's a wonderful little Scottish movie called Shallow Grave floating around (on DVD even, and it's quite fascinating); this movie is Shallow Grave gone bad.  The plot's very much the same, but the acting here -- if  you can call it acting -- is infinitely worse, and too many of the  characters are not very interesting and simply unlikable.  There's also  nothing memorable about the filmmaking itself -- it's very inconsistent, a  hodgepodge of styles that never come together in a true directorial vision.  In fact, sometimes it seems all director/screenwriter Witkins is  interested in are his actors pretty bodies.",959731200,6,622,5.15
1246494,4,B00001U0E4,"It's not easy to find movies with bisexual main characters.  ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" comes to mind.  And so does ""No Ordinary Love"".  I saw it first in Mexico on Pay TV under the title  ""Deseos Ocultos"" (Hidden Desires).  What I like most about this  movie is the fluid way characters go from liking a member of one sex to  liking a member of the other.  It is a very realistic portrayal, I think,  of a large segment of the population.  I also like the fact that the cast  is ethnically mixed (White, Asian, Latin, Black).  The filmmaker was trying  to show diversity in both race and sexual preference, and I think this adds  a lot to the movie's appeal.  Well, not everyone is blond and blue-eyed,  you know?  Also, I really identified with Vince wanting to try out several  personalities and ""looks"" before settling upon his  ""true"" self.",952992000,15,844,4.543624161073826
1246495,5,B00001U0E4,"I really loved Nicholas Roeg's film THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH starring Daviod Bowie because you had to watch it several times to ""get it"".  It's the same deal with NO ORDINARY LOVE.  Yeah, there are a lot  of subplots, but that makes it all the more interesting to watch the 2nd,  3rd and 4th time around.  And the unique thing about this very sexy soap  is: you can watch it once normally, and then again with Spanish subtitles  (practice your Spanish!) and again with French subtitles (ditto French),  and then again with a very interesting commentary by the filmmakers.  Then  you can isolate all kinds of wonderful moments from the film with the many  menus.  Somebody put a lot of thought into this DVD --much more than other  gay titles I've seen on DVD. It sure won't be something you watch once and  then put on the shelf to collect dust.",952560000,18,846,4.444444444444445
1246496,5,B00001U0E4,"For an independent, ""omnisexual"" picture, No Ordinary Love has a lot of really cool features on the DVD.  Everyone I know really likes the Vince and Ramon story, and the DVD makers took that subplot right out of  the movie and made it a stand-alone featurette!  You can also jump directly  to each of the hot love scenes between the beautiful young actors.  The DVD  version of the movie, an entertaining, Almodovar-esque comedic melodrama,  also has an informative and funny commentary track.  The music is great,  especially the bathtub scene with ""Tempted"".  The young actors  may not have acted much before, but they have so much screen charisma, I  didn't mind their inexperience.  I wish there were more movies like this  one.",951955200,20,732,4.89344262295082
1246497,4,B00001U0E4,"Actually, the many loves, and types of love, contained in this little film are quite 'ordinary' and happen every day. They just don't usually make it to the big, or little, screen. We have a guy who owns a house. He can't  come out because his mother fantasizes that he will get married one day. He  rents rooms to a female in a rock band (with whom he, and just about  everyone else, has an affair; a dead guy; a narcissistic (and justifiably  so) actor who likes it both ways; a cute little Asian boy; and an  over-weight bank teller. The movie must be viewed as a self-contained soap  opera, considering the myriad twists of plot and sub-plot, which involves  the usual betrayal, bank robbery, adultery, and murder. The nicest facet of  the story is the developing romance between Vince (the Asian boy) and his  'straight' hispanic neighbor, Ramon -- who is also the son of an abusive  father (upon whom his mother is cheating with Andy, the narcissistic  actor!). The only two who have any integrity in the film are Ramon and  Vince, and they are amply rewarded at the end. Probably only deserves three  stars, but the people are cute enough to bump it up to four. And it's just  nice to see a film where there is a natural variety of sexual preference.  It's not SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but it is fun.",947462400,36,1303,4.485106382978723
1246498,1,B00001U0E4,"this movie sounded like a cool idea.  apparently the idea was cool, but what came out of it wasn't.  the acting is bad, the characters are stiff.  you don't get enough to know the characters.  andy is cute and has a nice  body, but the plot sucked!",947462400,3,248,4.191489361702128
1246499,2,B00001U0E4,"This is one of the lousiest acted gay films I've seen in a long time. It's so bad, the DVD comes with an optional ""humorous commentary"" track that plays with the movie. The acting seems stiff. It's deffinately a  movie to laugh at, not with... It's only saving grace is the love story  between Vince and Ramone. Although the acting is no different than the rest  of the story, there are some moments that are pretty cool...",946425600,9,423,4.467532467532467
7914836,4,B00001U0E4,"THE TITLE  IS CORRECT.  THIS MUST BE A USC STUDENT FILM.  BUT, THE JUXTAPOSITION OF ACTIONS HERE, THEN  THERE  , WITH AT LEAST THREE STORY LINES, PLUS THE CHARACTERS, MADE THIS FILM  FUN  TO WATCH.",1438041600,,197,4.457142857142857
7914837,5,B00001U0E4,Thanks Azamon for offering great movies.  This was a very good movie.,1410134400,,69,4.75
7914838,2,B00001U0E4,"This was certainly not the greatest movie, but despite my feelings on it, I did want to just point out that I found the fact that these three guys on the cover do NOT appear in the film at all to be a bit strange....anyone else think this was weird?",1279411200,,249,4.0
7914839,4,B00001U0E4,"""No Ordinary Love"" is a delightful experience. It toys with our imaginations and fantasies as the story progresses almost willing it to a conclusion but often just put in for subtle teases..Its funny in parts and perhaps a bit unbelievable in others. The cast is eclectic with the main characters very cute. Overall not a bad watch and you find yourself staying to the end to make sure their is a happy ending...A good movie for the DVD collection. One to enjoy over and over with friends...",1121817600,3,491,4.655172413793103
7914840,2,B00001U0E4,"Closeted landlord Kevin lives with his weirdo tenants, an orphaned teenager, a male stripper and a girl playing in an all-girl rock band. Another tenant has recently fallen to his death in a drunken stupor. None of these people pay the rent.

Kevin's mum, who owns the house, threatens Kevin with eviction if he doesn't get some paying tenants who can help her meet the mortgages. Full-figured bank clerk Ben is recruited as the missing tenant, and all seems, well, - well!
Then Vince, the teenager, develops a crush on his latino friend Ramon, while Andy, the male stripper, comforts Ramon's slutty mother. Ben, meanwhile, is not what he appears to be, and Kevin marries the female rock singer to please mommy, even though he is still in love with the dead tenant. Kevin is one stupid guy.
Then things turn nasty...in a very strange way..
Trying to outguess this script is patently impossible. No ordinary love plays like something written by John Waters, directed by Andy Warhol/ Gregg Araki and produced by Aaron Spelling. The totally unsuitable music score leans heavily on Dallas, Melrose place and those icky Chris Columbus comedies. Swirling violins, moody pianos and ""funny"" pizzicato music whenever fat Ben enters the picture.
The plot is so scrappy it falls apart early on. A lot of interplay between the characters, sure, but nothing is even vaguely related to anything else. The ""acting"" is brutally bad. The schizofrenic mood never settles. From crime-caper to tender love story via melodrama and mystery back to social critique and satire on family life.
No ordinary love has one thing going for it: It's never dull. Terrible, yes, but never dull. I would choose this over any Chris Columbus movie, anytime. And - it's a gay movie, as well. Sort of. I could never figure it out.
The reviewer from Houston got it absolutely right. This is crazy, plain and simple. Crazy, crazy, crazy.",1038960000,4,1897,4.891304347826087
7914841,1,B00001U0E4,"I can't remember being so disappointed in a gay/lesbian movie.  The DVD package was really good, and that's what attracted me to the film even though I knew nothing about it.  But when I watched it, I found that I was laughing out loud - not at the film itself (which tries to be a quirky dramedy), but because it was so earthshatteringly awful.  The acting was bad, the script was worse, and the direction was terrible, as was the music.  The only reason I kept watching it was to see just how much worse it could get, and in that respect it didn't disappoint me.  What a gross, gross movie.",1030492800,7,592,4.297297297297297
7914842,1,B00001U0E4,This film is bizarre. The plot....err wait there is no plot from my point of view. I'm not sure if the director just wanted to throw people off by creating twists that you'd never guess in a million years. But that is the problem. The twists just does not make any sense. There are sexy scenes sure but you can always get another movie with a good story and very nice scenes to boot. Rent this video to see what I mean but don't waste your money on this one.,1028246400,3,458,4.1
7914843,4,B00001U0E4,"This movie is definitely crazy, but it is also quite funny.  Watching this story is like going on some kind of wild ride-like a roller coaster-the plot takes off and never looks back as it goes forward through all of its crazy twists and turns.  The relationship between Vince and Ramon is definitely the most compelling story of all the many subplots, and it is nice to have their story all by itself in the special features section.
Most of the characters are really funny: especially the very fat guy-who causes a lot of problems for Kevin-who owns the house that the fat guy is renting a room in.  Another character is Wendy, who is pregnant by her bisexual boyfriend-Tom-who marries Tom's male lover-Kevin.  Wendy and Kevin do this because she does not want to be a single mother and Kevin's mother is putting pressure on him to get married and have children, which he obviously is not all that keen on doing given the fact that he is gay.  (Does anyone want to guess as to how this marriage does?)  The last main character is Andy who is a bisexual stripper-or something like that.  Kevin, Vince, Wendy, Andy, and the Fat Guy all live together in Kevin's house.  Kevin has to have all these roommates so that he can pay the mortgage on the house his mom helped him buy.
If you can't tell by now, this is a pretty complicated movie with many subplots, but it is very funny and I enjoyed watching it.  Vince is by far the best character in this movie because he is the only one with any real depth--although with so many characters and subplots it is hard to give much depth to any one character.",986860800,12,1600,4.433447098976109
7914844,2,B00001U0E4,"The poeple in the movie - sorry, can't really call them actors - are cute. And the love story between Ramon and Vince is ok (Ramon is ok, to be honest). But apart from that this movie has no saving grace. A bad script... is served by nightmare directing and editing. As for the music, well er... makes you think that the acting wasn't so bad after all... music is worse.",980035200,6,370,4.225352112676056
7914845,2,B00001U0E4,"After watching this movie, I needed to ask myself, ""What the heck was that?""  ""No Ordinary Love"" has a fairly well written script, a number of plot twists & turns, as well as both internal & external conflicts among its characters.  I can honestly say I enjoyed the story.  Now you're problly asking, ""So, Brian... why only give it 2 stars?""  Well, to be frank, ""No Ordinary Love"" is the best example of ruining a film through poor direction that I can think of.  Some scenes seemed rushed, others were waaaay to long.  If there was a sight gag or amusing punch line, it was killed within the next 45 seconds because the scene was just too long.  Additionally, the acting provided by a number of characters was so poor... I just couldn't suspend my disbelief.  Honestly, I've heard more convincing drama on ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You"".  Some of these actors were pulled directly from the bottom of a Cracker-Jack box; anyone who's played with Cracker Jack toys knows they're amusing for 5 minutes... then you through them out or entertain the dog with them.  Overall, if your looking for a good story, try this movie.  It's well written & with the proper imagination can be quite entertaining.  If you're looking for convining acting or an example of a great indie-film.... you may have better luck with one of Ed Wood's films.",979689600,3,1327,4.672413793103448
