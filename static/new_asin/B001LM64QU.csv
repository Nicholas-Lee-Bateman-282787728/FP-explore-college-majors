8318605,5,B001LM64QU,"There are actually two ballets on this dvd: Purim, which presents the story of Esther from the Bible, and Carmen, presented as the original story from the novel. Both ballets are performed by the Gyor National Ballet of Hungary but are choreographed by two different choreographers. The style of both are a mixture of modern dance and classical ballet technique, as is often the case with ballets performed by dancers classically trained. There is no dancing on pointe anywhere in either ballet, but plenty of pas de deux, solos, and group dances. The quality of the dancing is first rate, as are the image and sound. Purim uses the Budapest Klezmer Band, giving the music a very authentic ethnic sound. Carmen uses a small orchestra, often sounding synthesized(I am not saying it actually is synthesized, only that it often has a thin, artificial sound). In addition to these two ballets, there are also two features: The Making Of Purim, and The Making Of Carmen. These are also first rate in their presentation. If you enjoy unusual, esoteric ballet miniatures, you should find these worthwhile.",1230854400,2,1098,4.9728260869565215
