1256326,2,B00002ZMNF,"Ok.  ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was great.  ""The Funhouse"" was just okay.  But to say ""Eaten Alive"" is even worth 90 minutes of your time is stretching it.  The story is...well let's  just say there is no story.  And the killer, well, wouldn't even frighten a  five year old.  The sets look fake, the costumes are cheesy, and the music  stinks.  Needless to say, ""Eaten Alive"" is probably one of the  worst films I have ever seen.  The only reason I gave it two stars is  because there are a few pretty decent chase scenes that can keep your  attention for a while and get your mind off how horrible the film really  is.",959385600,7,623,4.342105263157895
1256327,4,B00002ZMNF,"This has never been one of my favorite horror flicks, but it does have a very weird feel to it and is definitely worth a second look.  Ya, the set looks fake, the characters are one-dimensional, the gator is made out of  rubber, etc....but how can you hate a movie with such histrionics!  Neville Brand looks like he's on speed and really chews up his role to the  max and Marilyn Burns (Sally in ""Texas Chainsaw"") once again  proves how great an actress she was (or at least knows how to scream and  look terrified!).  Robert Englund plays a womanizing gigolo, Carolyn  Jones (Morticia! ) plays a disfigured Madam,  and Mel Ferrer is in it too,  but my favorite character is that obnoxious little girl who keeps  SCREEEEEEAAMING throughout the whole movie as the gator chases her under  the house.  EAT HER ALREADY!  It's absolutely hysterical!  This is  truly one bizarre puppy --- nowhere near as intense as TCM, but it still  has a lot going for it.  The DVD from ELITE is kind of a basic package -  the print used surprisingly has some scratches and other blemishes/wear  (mostly around reel changes), but overall it looks VERY NICE and is nothing  to complain about.  The only extra is the trailer.  Also, no paper insert  in the DVD case.  All in all, a worthy addition to a horror DVD  collection.",958176000,4,1305,4.565217391304348
1256328,2,B00002ZMNF,"First off, let me warn you: this is nowhere near The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I do have to give the film credit though, as it holds up considerably well, being in the shadow of that master film.  It's about a  crazed redneck feeding irate motel customers to his pet crocodile (or was  it alligator?), and Hooper tries for the ambience of Texas Chainsaw, and  it's emotional intensity.  As for how well he did, let's just say that you  should put Texas Chainsaw completely out of your mind while seeing this, or  you'll be very disappointed.  But if you like a little backwoods horror,  this one's not too bad.",953683200,5,610,4.564814814814815
1256329,5,B00002ZMNF,"First off:  Elite's widescreen DVD is terrific - this is the best this film is ever going to look. This semi-disappointing follow-up to Texas Chainsaw Massacre involves a lunatic who kills guests and feeds their  bodies to a crocodile that lives in the next door swamp.  Things are off to  a slow start at the beginning (you get a lot of sleazy decor) but once  Hooper cranks up the action to ram speed there are enough ladies screaming,  prostitutes running, lords-a-leaping, maids-a-milking - you get the idea.  The only problem is the hotel set.  It looks like a cheap set. In the chase  scenes, there is no camera movement - everyone just runs around in circles  in one wide shot.  The crocodile is not the most realistic thing ever (the  victims can be seen forcing themselves into its mouth).  Yet, the  performances are good and the whole affair is actually very disturbing.  On  that note, I recommend you check into this ""Horror Hotel"" for a  little ""Starlight Slaughter"" if you know what I mean.",950572800,22,1005,4.683908045977011

1256347,5,B00002ZMNF,"Just released from Arrow Films is Eaten Alive, an obscure horror classic that is sadly overshadowed by director Tobe Hooper's masterpiece The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I first saw this film several years ago and didn't really know what to make of it. A few viewings later (including a beat up print on the big screen) and I finally realized how great this weird, off-beat treat really is.

Eaten Alive stars veteran character actor Neville Brand as Judd, a psychotic war veteran with a hate for prostitutes and a love for crocodiles. In fact, he keeps one right outside his dumpy motel. An odd mix of folks pass by, providing victims for Judd's scythe and food for the croc.

What makes Eaten Alive so great are the claustrophobic sets, the trippy red lighting and most importantly the cast. Rarely have I seen such an amazing cast of B movie greats: Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund, William Finley (Phantom of the Paradise), Marilyn Burns (Texas Chain Saw Massacre), Mel Ferrer, Roberta Collins (Death Race 2000), Janus Blythe (The Hills Have Eyes), Stuart Whitman (Big Bad Mama) and more round out this stellar cast. Now what Arrow did with this film is nothing short of a miracle. The transfer is beautiful (much better than the beat up print I saw) and the bonus features, which include some archival as well as brand new interviews with Hooper and cast round out this amazing DVD/Blu Ray combo. Another nice thing about this release, like most Arrow releases, is that it comes with a very informative booklet and newly designed cover artwork. Though maybe not as well known as some of Tobe Hooper's other films, Eaten Alive is a sick little goody sure to please horror and exploitation fans alike.

Special Features include:

-Brand new 2K transfer from the original camera negative

-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations

-Optional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing

-Audio commentary with co-writer and producer Mardi Rustam, make-up artist Craig Reardon and stars Roberta Collins, William Finley and Kyle Richards

-New introduction to the film by director Tobe Hooper

-Brand new interview with Hooper

-My Name is Buck: Star Robert Englund discusses his acting career

-The Butcher of Elmendorf: The Legend of Joe Ball - The story of the South Texas bar owner on whom Eaten Alive is loosely based

-5ive Minutes with Marilyn Burns - The star of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre talks about working on Eaten Alive

-The Gator Creator: archival interview with Hooper

-Original theatrical trailers for the film under its various titles Eaten Alive, Death Trap, Starlight Slaughter and Horror Hotel

-US TV and Radio Spots

-Alternate credits sequence

-Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Gary Pullin

THE FILM - [3.5 / 5]:

Meet the maniac and his friend. Nearly a decade before he donned Freddy Kruger's famous red and green sweater, horror icon Robert Englund delivered a supremely sleazy performance as Buck in ""Eaten Alive,"" another essay in taut Southern terror from Tobe Hooper, director of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.""

Deep in the Louisiana bayou sits the ramshackle Starlight Hotel, destination of choice for those who like to check in but not check out! Presided over by the bumbling, mumbling Judd (and his pet crocodile which he keeps in a large pond out front), the patron of this particular establishment may seem like a good-natured ol' Southern gent, but he has a mean temper on him, and a mighty large scythe to boot. Oozing atmosphere from every pore (the entire film was shot on a sound-stage at the famous Raleigh Studious, which lends it a queasy, claustrophobic feel) ""Eaten Alive"" matches ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" for sheer insanity and even drafts in Chain Saw star Marilyn Burns as the terrorized woman-in-peril, alongside William Finley (Phantom of the Paradise) and Mel Ferrer (The Longest Day).

""Eaten Alive"" is a horror film I have enjoyed for a long time. It is similar in tone to Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" in that it has a dirty and gritty feel to it. The Starlight Hotel looks like the type of place you just drive right by when you are looking for a place to stay while on a road trip. It has that roach motel look to it that can almost make your skin crawl without even seeing the inside. This works wonderfully as it helps to further engulf the viewer in the sleazy atmosphere. The movie features a fair amount of blood and gore with the practical effects looking good.

Shortly after the film opens we meet Clara and also Buck, who utters a memorable phrase that has been repeated often over the years by those that have seen the film. After Clara scoffs at Buck's idea and intentions, she leaves for the Starlight Hotel where she encounters Judd (Neville Brand, ""Without Warning""). More visitors soon arrive including Harvey Wood (Mel Ferrer) who is looking for his daughter, and a family consisting of Roy (William Finley), Faye (Marilyn Burns) and their own daughter Angie (Kyle Richards, ""Halloween""). I don't want to spoil what happens along the way. Let's just say that not everyone survives until the end of the movie.

The film also features a number of other actors in small roles, that have worked in horror films including Stuart Whitman (Ruby), Crystin Sinclaire (Ruby) and Janus Blythe (Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes""). Fans of the sitcom, ""The Addams Family"" will find none other than Morticia herself, Carolyn Jones in the movie. But you probably won't recognize her due to her characters appearance.

AUDIO - [4.5 / 5]:

There is one audio option on this Blu-ray and it is an English LPCM Mono track. The sound quality is terrific. The dialogue and sound effects are crisp and crystal clear. The track maintains a well balanced volume level throughout the movie. Whether it is the ear piercing screams from a soon-to-be victim, the splashing of water outside the Starlight Hotel or sounds from the lively bar where Buck hangs out, it all sounds great. I did not notice any issues with the audio at all such as hissing, dropouts or pops. The Blu-ray also includes optional English SDH subtitles.

VIDEO - [4.5 / 5]:

""Eaten Alive"" arrives on Blu-ray courtesy of Arrow Video. The film is presented in 1080p with a 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio. For this Blu-ray release, Arrow Video had a brand new 2K transfer of the film created from the original camera negative. The results are fantastic. The movie has never looked better. The colors look great and really pop. The greens in Clara's outfit look gorgeous and robust. The contrast level in the film looks spot on. Black levels look fine as well. There is a nice looking layer of grain that looks to have been handled rather well. Even in darker scenes, it never seems overly heavy as is the case with other films. Throughout the movie, there is a good amount of detail present. In brighter scenes, the fine detail really shines whether it's the characters hair, clothing or miscellaneous objects. The film elements appear to have been well kept over the years with how great this transfer looks. Skin tones also have a pleasant and natural appearance. There are some instances of white specks here and there, but I did not find it to occur frequent enough to be distracting. Fans should be extremely pleased with the amazing job Arrow has done.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [4.5 / 5]:

Intro by Tobe Hooper - When playing the film, you have the option to view it with a 20 second Intro by director Tobe Hooper.

Audio Commentary - This track features co-writer and producer Mardi Rustam, make-up artist Craig Reardon and stars Roberta Collins (Clara), William Finley (Roy) and Kyle Richards (Angie). The participants are not all present together for this commentary. Their individual segments are proceeded by an introduction with their name, which is a nice touch so listeners can easily tell who is speaking. First up is Mardi Rustam who as well as talking about Tobe Hooper and other members of the cast and crew, tells an interesting story about Robert Caramico, the director of photography. He said that during the second week of shooting, a couple union officials came to visit Mr. Caramico to tell him he was not allowed to work on the non-union film. After they discussed the matter, Robert Caramico quit the union and tore up his card, so he could continue working on the movie. Next to speak is Roberta Collins who tells a story of how a seemingly innocent dinner with Neville Brand turned into a scary situation. William Finley follows and he talks about his role in the film and also speaks about what is happening on the screen through several scenes. Kyle Richards also chimes in on her role of Angie and how she was scared to death when Neville Brand was chasing her because she felt like she was going to actually be killed. Craig Reardon discusses some members of the cast, including Neville Brand and also his career. This commentary track was fairly informative and a pleasure to listen to all participants. Fans of the film should enjoy this.

IN CONCLUSION:

A good horror film and an outstanding release by Arrow Video. As mentioned before, this is a Blu-ray and DVD Combo Pack. If you are a fan of this film, you most definitely want to purchase this. There is a trailer below for those who are unfamiliar with ""Eaten Alive."" I suggest horror fans buy this release because it not only has great audio and video quality, it also includes a large amount of special features. For those checking my math for the overall score, yes I know it technically should be 4.25 but since I go by half-points, I rounded up since this release is more than deserving.

1256349,4,B00002ZMNF,"This is another example of a classic horror film that somehow I had never seen.  Director Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is probably my favorite horror film of all time.  Actually, it might be my favorite film of all time, period!  It would naturally make sense that I would check up Hooper's follow up to TCM asap!  Why I never have I really couldn't tell you, but better late than never I guess.  I am so thankful to have finally seen this film.  It's not in the same league as TCM, but it is very close and actually has a lot of the feel of the original TCM.

 You can definitely tell this is by the same director that did THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, as it has the same gritty, dirty feeling that TCM did.  In fact, the owner of the motel (played by Neville Brand) could easily be a member of the Sawyer family from TCM, as he has the same crazy feel to him.  Worth noting also is Robert Englund's early performance as Buck.  It was neat seeing ""Freddy"" in this early role.

  While this is technically a ""creature feature"" since it contains a killer crocodile, the real stars of this film are the creepy characters and especially Judd, the hotel owner, who actually feeds the people to the hungry croc.  Judd is the true killer, here....his pet croc being his ""weapon"" of choice.

  If you are fan of director Tobe Hooper and especially of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE,  you will definitely want to add this one to your movie collection.",1447200000,,1448,4.437262357414449
1256350,5,B00002ZMNF,"Tobe Hooper always seems to get the short end of the stick when compared to his horror contemporaries like Carpenter, Romero, Craven and Cronenberg. I think it's his ability to shift his sensibilities in somewhat of a workmanlike way that is the root cause. With Chain Saw he is doing a documentarian style, here, an artificial, studio bound film. 'Salem's Lot has a tv film feel (perhaps because it was), Poltergeist feels Spielbergian because no matter what Spielberg's level of involvement was, it's supposed to feel Spielbergian. Lifeforce is sci-fi horror on a grand scale while The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2 brings out more of the comedy that Hooper has always claimed was in the first film (cloaked in absolute terror.) Even his film The Funhouse from 1981 is a slasher of it's time albeit mixed with a classic monster film. My point to all this is to say that Hooper has been constrained critically I think by his willingness to bend and adapt to each project. It's true that he fell off in the late 80's and hasn't really recovered but from my perspective Eaten Alive has always been a bit overlooked and I believe this Arrow bluray/dvd set goes a long way to change that.

1256351,4,B00002ZMNF,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Director Tobe Hooper has long been one of my favorite horror directors.  In addition to directing possibly THE greatest horror film of all time (of course, Im referring to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), Hooper has helped launch the careers of some of the genres biggest stars, including Robert Englund, Marily Burns, and Steve Railsback.  EATEN ALIVE is one of his earlier titles, released a couple of years after CHAINSAW, and it packs just as much of a punch.  Granted, this film is more of a surrealistic nightmare rather than an in-your-face terrorfest, but Hoopers signature brand of demented horror is alive and well within it.

I learned in one of the featurettes that this movie is actually based on a true story.  It is very loosely based on a man known as The Butcher of Elmendorf a.k.a. Joe Ball, who killed a couple of women he was seeing back in the 30s.  This fascinating aspect made the film even more engrossing for me.

EATEN ALIVE looks very much like CHAINSAW in the way it is shot; the cinematography captures well the dark atmosphere that hangs in the air throughout the film.  I would label this as Hoopers signature style, however his later films do not have this foreboding sense of dread.

The acting is superb, with Neville Brand in the lead role as the demented hotel owner, Judd.  Brand gives an amazing performance, and I never once had any problem believing he was crazy.  The film also boasts a very talented supporting cast that includes Mel Ferrer, Carolyn Jones, Marily Burns, Robert Englund (yes, Freddy himself!), and Stuart Whitman.

The story is dark and bizarre.  Although Judd does feed several victims to his croc, the main gist of the plot is Judd terrorizing several sets of people, including a couple with a little girl, both in and outside the hotel.  If hes not choking a woman with a shower curtain liner, hes trying to chop up the little girl as she crawls around underneath the building.  I found myself watching all of this unfold in awe, and I kept wondering what in the world he would do next.

EATEN ALIVE is a huge win for me, and I highly recommend it.  The fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD have restored this horror classic in HD, and the result is amazing.  The picture is near-perfect HD, while the sound is phenomenal.  Do yourself a favor, and grab this on Blu-ray today.",1445212800,,2404,4.6117647058823525
1256352,5,B00002ZMNF,"EATEN ALIVE Not my favourite Tobe Hooper film but still enjoyable to watch lots of suspense & Horror
brilliantly written script by Kim Henkel who co-wrote the Texas chainsaw massacre
and of course Great Directing by Tobe Hooper himself
an interesting little Horror film which was filmed on a soundstage actually in Hollywood California, not on Location
the main story is about a mental propertier who owns a Hotel & feeds his Guests to his pet Crocodile/Aligator
not before knocking them out first
i prefer TCM than this story, as i said still enjoyable to watch
first released on DVD by Dark sky films about 10 years ago now.
U.K.'s  Arrow films have taken over and released the film on blu-ray with a new 2k HD restoration approved by Tobe Hooper
Arrow films made the effort big time giving this film a new HD transfer making the region A & B for U.S. fans
the picture quality does look excellent very nice restoration in the colour of the film approved by Tobe
much better quality than the very old dvd version i think
the sound quality for this new blu-ray is only a Mono sound which i think is a poor effort
the sound mix could've been boosted big time with a new master audio stereo mix at least, not mono sound how stupid
Arrow films have also added new special features aswell as carrying over all the extras fro the old 2 disc dvd set
you get new interviews with Tobe Hooper, Actress Janus Blythe, and special effects make up man Craig reardon
this new interview with Tobe only goes for 14mins
its an alright interview Tobe has memory problems about his recollection of the film
which doesn't surprise me he's close to 80 years old now
the Archive Tobe Hooper interview from the 2 disc dvd set i think is more informative detailed interview about the film
which is on this blu-ray aswell
the new interview with Janus Blythe goes for 11mins, i didn't think was very interesting to watch
she only briefly talks about her role in Eaten alive which is about 3mins maybe
the rest of the interview is about her Acting career
the Craig reardon interview was interesting aswell
plus all the old extras from the 2 disc dvd set are carried over
the old dvd commentary with producer Mardi rustam & Actress Roberta collins who sadly Died back in 2008 from Drug overdose
as said the old archives interviews from the dvd version are on this blu-ray
Tobe Hooper interview, Robert Englund, Roberta collins

1256353,4,B00002ZMNF,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

In 1974 a young director by the name of Tobe Hooper unleashed upon the world one of the most disturbing, frightening films of all time, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Having only directed one feature prior to this, an experimental sci-fi flick, Hooper set out to scare us with things we had never seen before. In fact he actually didn't show as much as viewers think they saw, the film was that good. A year later he dipped into the horror/exploitation pool again. It might not have been quite as good but then again it did stand up well on its own.

EATEN ALIVE offers a few shock moments but those lie more in the dialogue than in the bloodletting we witnessed in TCM. The story involves a slightly insane hotel owner named Judd (Neville Brand) whose ramshackle building lies in East Texas and features a swamp just outside the front door that holds a huge crocodile hes installed there. A great tagline might have been those who check in never check out but then Judd doesnt always do the worst to his guests.

When a young woman leaves the local brothel with the intent to return to her home, she stops to spend the night there. But the religious zealot in Judd surfaces and after a struggle she ends up in the water with the croc. Judd seems unfazed by this and goes about his business.

A family stops to spend the night after having driven all day long. This family, Roy (William Finley), Faye (Marilyn Burns) and young Angie (Kyle Richards) leaves a lot to be desired, a perfect picture of dysfunctional. There visit begins with the pet poodle finding its way under the fence and becoming an appetizer for the croc. Angie goes into hysterics and the family takes a room where Roy seems to become totally unhinged.

The next set of guests are an older man named Harvey (Mel Ferrer) and his daughter Libby (Cristyn Sinclaire), looking to find the other daughter who left a while back. Surprise! She turns out to be the first meal we saw eaten earlier. They leave to contact the local sheriff (Stuart Whitman) for help in finding their daughter. He goes along with them to Miss Hatties (Carolyn Jones) place to be told she was never there.

The last set of guests to check into Judds hotel are Buck (Robert Englund) and Lynette (Janus Blythe). As we saw at the start of the film Buck was the reason the missing daughter left Hatties to begin with. Hes now moved on to the local bar floozy in hopes of a little action. With everyone in place you know the guests are going to drop off one at a time as the movie progresses.

EATEN ALIVE could have been just another drive-in movie to toss on the scrap heap of odd films that were just movies that shuffled from town to town on the outdoor screen. But Hooper tosses in some artistic merit into the film with various styles put to use. His choice of lighting in garish colors works for most scenes. The entire film was shot on a soundstage and while thats obvious it works here. The scares aren't like what we saw in TCM but they do exists on a much lower key here. What makes it work is the sense of total insanity caught on screen.

Brand who was nearing the end of his career does a fine job here. Both Jones and Whitman seem wasted but at the same time their personas were enough to carry them thought the roles they were given here. And when it comes to screaming children Richards seems to be at the top of the list.

This movie has had numerous releases over the years with so many people claiming to have owned the rights but this time around we get a serious presentation. Arrow Films who I have praised in the past has done an exceptional job here. Not only do fans finally get a decent looking print of the movie, the extras are as fun to watch as the movie itself. Included in the extras are:

-A 2K restoration of the film approved by Hooper
-Both blu-ray and standard DVD copies
-An isolated music and effects soundtrack
-Audio commentary tracks with co-writer and producer Martin Rustam, starts Roberta Collins, William Finley and Kyle Richards, and make-up artists Craig Reardon
-A new introduction to the film by Tobe Hooper
-Blood on the Bayou, a brand new interview with Hooper
-Gator Bait, a new interview with Janus Blythe
-Monsters and Metaphors, a new interview with Craig Reardon
-The Gator Creator, an archive interview with Hooper
-My Name is Buck, an archive interview with Robert Englund
-5ive Minutes with Marilyn Burns talking about working on the film
-The Butcher of Elmendorf: The Legend of Joe Ball, a featurette looking at the true life story the movie is based on
-Trailers for the film under the various names it was released as like Eaten Alive, Death Trap, Starlight Slaughter and Horror Hotel
-TV and radio spot
-Alternate credits
-Behind the scenes slideshow
-Still and promo material
-Audience comment cards
-A reversible sleeve featuring the original and newly commissioned artwork by Gary Pullin
-A collectors booklet with new writing on the film by critic Brad Stevens, illustrated with original archive stills and posters

For Hooper fans this will be a must have for your collection, the same for horror fans who have long waited for a decent copy of the movie. As you can see the extras alone make it worth the price.

He's got a strange, quirky side to him that is reflected is this movie's weird score, which Hooper helped design. This movie takes place in the Texas Bayou, which I didn't even know was a thing. The acting fails to hit that miraculous sweet spot between abysmal and excellent that you get in Texas Chainsaw Massacre; everything is done in a stiff, caricatured style that's a carryover from the sleazier horror films of the 1950s and early 60sbut the world they inhabit, the situations they inhabit, all are imbued with shades of real fear that would have been hard to achieve in that era.

1256367,5,B00002ZMNF,"Fueled by an undeniably eccentric and psychotic performance by the great Neville Brand, ""Eaten Alive"" is one of those forgotten, greasy, drive-in horror classics that belongs in every true film collector's stash of titles, and DarkSky Films has done an absolutely fantastic job on this set. While the print quality of the film is not necessarily re-mastered (it's an oldie, recall) in terms of cleaning and sharpening, this is a collector's item of a release if anything is. You probably won't be finding this one at Wal-Mart around Halloween.
Tobe Hooper (whose ""Poltergeist"" was simply too stylish to have been concocted entirely by his own hands, but we needn't get into that here) has perfected his gritty, underground, exploitation filmmaking style with this one. Now, read me here, ""Eaten Alive"" is not for every taste...if you enjoy today's hyper fast editing and silly filmmaking techniques which go FLASH! and AH! at you as if you are a short-attention-spanned geek on ""medication,"" then you won't be in this audience for long, but if you appreciate slower building tension, films that focus upon acting rather than special effects presentations, and movies that have truly lower-brow but nonetheless honest drive-in theatrical intentions, then you may end up endearing to this one as I have. Brand's performance elevates what could have been seedy material into the 'must-see' category--has there ever been a more reliable character actor than him in Western cinema? Viewers should know that there are a couple of nude scenes in the film, that come rather late into the movie...nothing too graphic (for this kind of story) but I'm giving you a heads up--still, Hooper does not eroticize these sexual situations, and that right there tells you something about his more serious intentions as a horror filmmaker. Of course, there is also some blood and gore flying about, but nothing as drastic or hair-raising as in the ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (another classic which used sound to great effect rather than expensive blood buckets). There is some screaming going on (of course), but it's not as annoying here as it is in other horror films--a cheap effect which I feel depletes the tolerability of some horror films which house pretty intense and serious narratives otherwise. And let's not forget that alligator! ""The Alligator People"" was not nearly as much fun as this.
The DarkSky extras on this release are equally collectible and intense. Quality interviews with star Robert Englund and Marilyn Burns are very nice to listen to, while the documentary upon the real-life crazy who inspired this story is fascinating and well-done indeed (kudos to producer Michael R. Felsher, who has done a lot of great work in preserving interest in these old movies via his Red Shirt ""making of"" productions--titles of which also turn up on recent Blu-Ray and DVD release by the unbeatable Shout/Scream factory). This is the way that an extras disc should be done! Also, a rare (but not terribly revealing) interview with director Hooper is included...he is apparently a rather reclusive and hard to track down figure upon the movie scene (nothing wrong with that in my estimation, but odd for a horror film director with so many unusual pictures on his hands). If you consider yourself a horror collector or a horror fan, you must have ""Eaten Alive"" in your collection. Otherwise, forget about it being complete. Brand was one hell of an actor, and that's all that can be said about this time capsule of horror cinema. A+",1416441600,3,3526,5.039383561643835

This was Tobe Hoopers next film after Texas Chainsaw Massacre and its amazing the difference in quailty, atmosphere, acting and story from the director and writer of Texas. It's really like two totally different directors did this. The studio sets have such a cheap feel to them that you know your watching a hotel built inside a studio. Like watching a play at times. The acting is also horrible. Robert Englund is in this and how he got another role after this is a mystery. This is his 1st line he delivers with the worse country hick accent in movie history. ""Name is Buck....and I'm raring to f&!c.""

1256371,5,B00002ZMNF,"For fans of seventies slasher horror, this is the movie for you.  For fans of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this is also the movie for you; though, it does not quite hold up to TCSM.  The transfer quality of video and audio is pretty good.  It feels like an old midnight horror flick, which is kind of the point.

For those not familiar with this movie (or this type of movie), Eaten Alive is about a hotel owner in the bayou who attacks people with a long scythe and feeds them to an alligator.  That's pretty much it.  What I like about this movie is the array of bizarre characters.  Nobody seems quite right in the head, and some of them seem like they could be serial killer themselves.  I also like the creepy, low-lit atmosphere.  It was filmed on a sound stage, rather than outdoors like TCSM, and that gives the movie a claustrophobic ambiance which adds to the creepy mood.  For a low budget, last minute follow-up to TCSM, this is a really fun midnight horror movie.  Keep in mind, it is not a sequel to TCSM, which I have heard some people speculate.

The special features are also really interesting.  There is a great behind the scenes feature that provides a lot of information about how the film was shot, what the actors were like (that's a pretty interesting segment all its own), and how the movie was received after the frenzy of TCSM.

This particular 2 dist special edition is well worth the price, which is usually very low, and is a necessary addition to any horror or Tobe Hooper movie collection.  Watch it really late at night with all the lights off.",1412121600,,1578,4.430555555555555

I avoided this movie for years because of the terrible reviews on Amazon. After finally watching it, I can safely say this rocks.  Neville Brand who plays 'Ol Judd' is one of the most convincing psychopaths I have ever seen in a movie. Brand was a war vet and you can see the crazy look in his eyes, the guy deserves much more credit for his superb acting skills here. Marilyn Burns and Will Finley play a dysfunctional couple who stay at the wackjob Judds motel, and they also bring a lot of psychodrama and wackiness to the movie, especially Finley as the husband, the bits where he flips out in the motel room are superb. Also notable is Robert Englunds performance as 'ol BUCK' the perverted man whore who gets under Judds Skin.

1256379,5,B00002ZMNF,"Tobe Hooper had an amazing ability to capture on film what might be the closest thing to real life traumatic scenarios. Eaten alive isn't as insane as ""Chainsaw"", but it definitely gains ground and nips the heels of Mr. Hoopers first film. Eaten Alive drops a bunch of human beings inside another maniacs psychotic world, and shocks and baffles them abruptly. Like TCM, i cant help but feel the  victims confusion and fear as they run and fight for their survival while experiencing a living nightmare.

Tobe hoopers atmosphere in this film creates such an eerie and hopeless feeling that its utterly nerve wracking. The beauty about many horror films from the 70's is that they relied on suspense, atmosphere and psychological jabbing, so graphic gore and violence was never essential in putting that terrifying imprint on our love to be scared brains. Although Eaten Alive might be more graphic than Chainsaw, it's quite tame for todays standard and as i get older I am appreciative of that. So i express that its more fun to have my nerves jolted than to witness acts of graphic violence on screen. Can i say atmosphere again? The red light which soaks the screen and the swampy mists that linger are superb. Ive heard critiques of the acting, and i disagree; great depictions of shock and terror appear expertly on these actors and actresses faces, and that goes back to my original point.. The first two Hooper films, TCM and this one, play out more like live dock-dramas.. it seems as if were watching recorded terror. The colors and speckles and scratches on the print adds such flavor to the mood as well, and a total remastering of this might really ruin it.

Have a glass of wine, smoke a joint, well, actually you might want a clear head while watching this one.. but regardless whether your buzzed or not, you won't be able make reason or understand ""why"", and not in a confusing way but more so a way that just kind of leaves you rattled.. yeah, i guess like Chainsaw did.

This must have been an experience to see at a drive-in.

1256383,4,B00002ZMNF,"With Hooper's follow up to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he seemed to be trying for the whole ""if it ain't broke...."" approach.  Eaten Alive is probably what Psycho would have been if Hooper had beaten Hitchcock to the punch.  This movie is so similar to TCM(that's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, not Turner Classic Movies) in terms of look, feel, soundtrack, and even some of the actors, that it's almost an unofficial sequel.  But though the style is the same, that doesn't mean we're dealing with a film as good as TCM, but in Hooper's defense, that's a hard act to top.  This film also has an Argento touch, with many of the scenes bathed in red and blue light.  It's also got the TCM grainy look, but a little more slick.
The story is rather simple.  A lunatic named Judd runs a grimy hotel, and he has a thing for killing his tenants with a scythe and throwing them to his pet gator.  That's about it.
I'm surprised anyone would stop at this place considering how yucky it looks, and Judd makes no attempt to even act normal to anyone.  The scariest thing here is a brief appearance by William Finley, who as any normal American would know, played The Phantom Of The Paradise.  He shows up with his wife and kid, and acts so friggin' nuts that he comes across as more dangerous than Judd.  Finley's wife is played by none other than TCM's Marilyn Burns.  Basically she's reprising her role from that film as she is beaten, bound, and terrorized.  And yes, she screams a lot too.
Hooper gives us a bit of sex and nudity here, most of these scenes involving a young Robert Englund as a scumbag named Buck, a guy who likes to.......play pool.
Neville Brand is a decent psycho.  He looks like a bespectacled neanderthal man who's constantly mumbling and ranting nonsense.  I still think Finley was creepier.
The gator is nothing to brag about, but I have a thing for fake looking gators.
Needless to say, this film is not for everyone.  The grimy, trippy 70s style will put off modern filmgoers, but it creates a unique atmosphere that films just don't have anymore.  Plus it's full of trademark oddball Hooper characters and not the best acting in the world.  Nor is it action packed.  So yeah, I'd steer clear unless you have a thing for out-there 70s sleaze.",1329523200,,2256,4.5283950617283955
1256384,2,B00002ZMNF,"Tobe Hooper notwithstanding, this is an oddity (in every sense of the word).  There's no plot to speak of, most of the action takes place in, under, and around the Starlight Hotel.  It's an ugly set poorly lit.  All in all, a pointless exercise in excess.
Think about it, people check in, few leave, how is it that no one noticed all those cars with not enough drivers to account for them?  As for the local characters, all first cousins?  Or just bad acting?  I did feel sorry for poor Carolyn Jones and Mel Ferrer; they were stars once.  As for Neville Brand, he gave new meaning to raving lunatic!  Even when he was more or less docile, who would check into a hotel he was running?  Well, even desperate, who would check into a motel with a croc out front!?
Weird.  But not in a good way.  More than a bit heavy handed, this was just a loud obnoxious piece of schlock.  I can't think of a single sequence that stood out, that couldn't have been done better, if one were tempted to redo it.

Definitely not as groundbreaking as TCM but an alright 70's horror flick. I guess Toby Hooper even did the music for the film which sounds like weird ghosty sounding music you would hear in a cheesy 70's Italian zombie flick... which I guess is kinda cool. Also one of the semi main characters ""Buck"" is played by Robert England delivering the famous line ""my name is Buck and I'm here to f**k,"" which I'm guessing Quentin Tarentino took from and put his own film ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" purty cool movie trivia there for yeh. There's plenty of topless women and a sweet fake crocodile that eats like 4 people and a little dog throughout the course of the film so that's also a plus.

There's not a serious horror feel to Eaten Alive. That's where it loses all comparisons to TCM. It's more of a 60s Batman kind of campy horror at times. Really fun but not TCM scary.

It's worth watching and fun to watch and you can see why it must have been great at the Drive-In in the 70s. Maybe it was scary in that setting and time period but it just doesn't hold up as something that frightens you today.",1291507200,,752,4.0675675675675675
1256387,5,B00002ZMNF,"Folks  also said that Homicidal was a rip-off of Psycho, Terror Train, a rip-off of Halloween, & The Fury, a Carrie rip-off. All of which aren't true.

Granted, Tobe Hooper is recognized for his success with TCM, but for all these negative reviews from those who felt the film fell short of the sucess of Tobe's earlier work just simply isn't fair.  The premise of this film was different, though there seemed to be some similarities between the two.  I first saw this as a child at the drive-in with my mom & enjoyed it then & having finally gotten to see it 33 years later, I still enjoy it.  The film has a haunting & creepy atmosphere.  The dark lighting & swamp setting fit the story.

I also thought the scythe killings were pretty graphic.  Especially Libby's Dad. So I don't see why horror fans are speaking of low gore content.  I *did* find the little girl running from Judd underneath the hotel & Marilyn Burns' trying to break loose to be a bit draggy, but the film continued to hold my interest. Neville Brand shined in this part.  He made Judd so compelling & engrossing to watch, you wanted to see what would happen next.

This film was never meant to be a sequel to TCM & the way some of you are giving it a thumbs down because you felt it didn't live up to TCM is very unfair.  Eaten Alive was an ample, low budget horror film.  Very stark & atmosperic & I for one am pleased a 2 disc edition of the movie was released.

1256389,1,B00002ZMNF,"As a bit of a horror film buff, I'm always looking to check out some of the older b-movie horrors of the past, both to learn more about what makes for a good scare, as well as to get interesting insights into exactly how and why those things have changed over the decades. And I can safely say that ""Eaten Alive"" provided none of that for me.

This is the third film from Director Tobe Hooper (known mainly for his cult classic ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre""). Once again, the film revolves around a mentally disturbed person, living within the southern part of the United States. This time around, the story is about a deranged inn keeper who, for reasons never explained, keeps killing the guests who come to his motel and feeding them to the large crocodile in the swamp next to it.

Those who are familiar with Hooper's style, will see a lot of similarities between this film and his most famous work, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", which was the film he made directly preceding this one. It is filled with the kind of strange and oddball cinematography, with weird neon lighting and close-up focusing shots on weird images throughout. But unlike the previous work, it doesn't really gel here. What once might have been directorial excess, is simply pointless and unintelligible nonsense. It is obvious he's trying to set an eerie and creepy atmosphere, but it is just so poorly crafted and lacking in any sense of commonality, that what is meant to feel bizarre and surreal, feels completely unbelievable instead. The script for this must have been about one page long, as that is how bad the plot and storytelling here is.

The acting is, also, very much below par, even by low budget horror film standards. It is shown that the inn keeper (played by Neville Brand) is out-of-his-mind, but we never come to understand why or what it is the guests do that sets him off. This lack of context makes it almost impossible to be scared by his crazy (re)actions and leaves you more inclined to scratch your head in puzzlement, than to feel any sense of dread or menace. None of the other characters really gets enough development for you to care about them, save that of Buck (played by a then unknown Robert Englund). His performance is the only one to have any real resonance at all and even that isn't very much.

Perhaps Hooper thought he could capture lightning in a bottle for a second time, like he did with ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" a couple years earlier (even going so far as to bring back Marilyn Burns to play the part of a victim once more). But as this film shows, it isn't something you can force or easily recreate. As a result, ""Eaten Alive"" never really comes to life or finds it's own voice (a point only belabored, by the fact this film has been renamed many different times). It just stagnates and meanders, providing no real thrills, scares, or even the macabre tone of TCM. If you are a Hooper completist, you might derive some kind of enjoyment or interest from this outing. Otherwise, you are best just to skip on this uninteresting and plot less bomb. The reason this film is highly overlooked, isn't because it was ahead of it's time. It is because efforts this poor are better off being forgotten.",1272585600,2,3230,4.583044982698962

1256391,1,B00002ZMNF,"Where do you begin with this flick?

Let me give the uninitiated a quick rundown, crazy hotel owner on the bayou feeds various guests to the crocodile living on his property. Hmmmm did I leave anything out? Nope, that just about covers it. Oh, I should mention that each of his guests is more annoying than the next, and each seems to get progressively more stupid as the film plays out. Let me present a few lowlights:

1. Who knew you could light an entire film scrictly with those red heating lamps they use at McDonalds to keep the McNuggets warm? Seriously, the cartoonish lighting in this flick is headache inducing! This lighting worked okay in ""Creepshow"", but it's so overpowering in this film, it's distracting. Its like that ""Seinfeld"" episode where Kenny Roger's Roasters opened across the street from Kramer's apartment, and bathed everything in a soul searing red light.

2. ""Splatter-fest"" - Really? Who describes the film that way? If so, they haven't seen a genuine ""splatter"" movie. This flick can't even be considered a splatter flick for it's time...not with ""2000 Maniacs"", ""Blood Feast"" and Hooper's own ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" preceeding it. If there is blood shown, the lighting is so funky it will look black or cartoonish red.

3. Neville Brand, Carolyn Jones & Stuart Whitman all deserved much better than this. At least Brand gets to act all kinds of psycho, the others are simply wasted. Robert Englund I will give a pass, as a young actor just starting out, he probably grabbed this role with both hands.

4. Fans of 1970's Country Music should be pleased with soundtrack. Others...not so much.

5. If you thought the ""lagoon set"" from Gilligan's Island looked fake...wait til you get a look at this ""hotel in the swamp"" set!?!? It was really nice of the community theater to let them borrow it for the film.

6. What the hell is up with all the actresses wearing curly haired wigs? Was that some kind of early 70's fad I missed out on?

Honestly, there is nothing to recommend about this film. Gore hounds will be disappointed, the suspense found in Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is absent, if they are going for dark humor in the flick...they failed. It's just a bad film, badly shot, badly written and badly acted. Not in a so-bad-its-good way either....just boring-bad.",1258675200,3,2310,4.801007556675063

It's much better than THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, which is a comedy.  What's wrong is the timing.  The prelude-episode, from the beginning until the death of one of the main characters--has so much adrenaline that the rest of the movie, which drags anyway, fails to sustain it.  The protagonists in TEXAS CM were ordinary; the protagonists in EATEN ALIVE are activly dislikable, including Marilyn Burns' character, whose screams and thrashings give me no pity nor terror this time.  The prelude also has the best acting, including Robert Englund hilariously imitating, or at least borrowing from, George C. Scott's performance as another ""Buck"" in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, and, better simulated death by penetrating trauma even than the meathook episode in THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.

Based on what I read about the plot of this movie and the fact that a young Robert Englund acted in this film, I thought Eaten Alive would be worth the purchase, especially seeing how I'm such a fan of the horror genre.

Well, once I finished watching it, I was set straight. So allow me to do the same for you: Don't waste your time or your money. It's really that simple.

Dark Sky must have had to work extra hard to restore this film and it's still a grainy mess! Grain ran for over 95 percent of the movie, which seem to enhance the atmosphere, but it was way too much. I imagine the original negative was not properly cared for.

The movie is supposedly based on the true story of a hotel owner who had an alligator as an attraction and where several women were murdered, though it was never proven he fed them to the alligator.

I watched it because it was directed by Tobe Hooper (this was his follow-up to Chainsaw).  The other notable horror connections are Robert Englund in his first significant role (listen for his first line at the beginning) and Marilyn Burns (from Chainsaw).

What can you expect from this movie?  A hotel owner that mumbles incoherently to no one for most of the movie, bad dialogue, bad special effects (though Steve Martin would be proud of the scythe killing), and the worst music ever contained in a horror movie.  Are you getting the picture yet?  It's bad!

I only watched the movie itself on cable, so the DVD special features may be worth watching, but there is no way in hell this movie rates 4 or 5 stars.  Do not waste money buying or renting this movie!  You have been warned.",1214006400,2,1212,4.463636363636364
1256396,1,B00002ZMNF,"The amazing thing that jumped out at me while watching EATEN ALIVE was that Tobe Hooper made this AFTER he made THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  This movie definitely looks like a debut: it's horrible.

Everything that worked in TEXAS CHAINSAW doesn't work here.  It looks and sounds horrible.  The sets are cheap and the story--what story there is--drags along.  Marilyn Burns appears to spend her entire part of the movie tied to a bed.  In one long scene--a very long scene--a mother squirms and bounces and tries to scream through her gag in one room of a house.  A couple tries to get busy (a young Robert Englund!) in another room.  And under the house is a crying little girl trying to elude the psycho and then his fake-looking alligator.  All of this noise is drowned out by a radio blasting terrible Country music.  I've never been a big fan of Country music...but I really hated it after enduring this movie.  (That it switched to Mariachi music for the finale didn't help).

I've never really known what to think about Tobe Hooper.  I thought THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was a classic in horror films.  EATEN ALIVE is pure drive-in dreck, amateurish and lame.  FUNHOUSE was fifth-rate slasher crap.  I'd also read that Hooper, although his name is still on POLTERGEIST, had very little to do with it (stylistically, that movie has Steven Spielberg all over and I'd read that he actually finished the picture).

I caught this on the Independent Film Channel or the Sundance Channel as part of a ""grindhouse"" retrospective.  I remember watching awful movies like this at the extinct drive-in movies theatres of the 70s or cut-to-ribbons on local Monster Chiller Horror Theatre shows.  It's laughable how Sundance and IFC elevate such rotten movies to snobbish ""grindhouse classic"" status.

But I'm curious how a lousy flick like this gets 2-Disc Special Edition treatment.  What on earth could be on it to justify that?

Judd (Neville Brand) is a self-righteous, homicidal maniac who sees himself as judge, jury, and executioner of those he convicts of being unclean / sinful. The guilty are slain, either by scythe or Judd's handy pet alligator (or both)! Judd also has a serious problem w/ his temper. He just cannot control it!

Carolyn Jones (House Of Wax, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, ""The Addams Family"") is the crusty old madame, Hattie. Stuart Whitman plays the sheriff.

1256398,3,B00002ZMNF,"Judd is insane; he owns the Startlight Hotel in a swamp.  He feeds his guests to his pet crocodile.  After the success of ""Jaws,"" Tobe Hooper tried his hand at directing a creature feature, ""Eaten Alive.""  This movie is very similar to ""Psycho.""  Early in the film, Judd repeatedly strikes a young prostitute with a rake, stabbing her numerous times.  While she is still breathing, he throws her off the front porch railing.  The crocodile rises up from the water and gobbles her up.  Just as in ""Psycho,"" her sister, and also her father, come by the hotel looking for her.

This movie is very intense, from its bloody beginning to its bloody ending.  Though not as provocative as Tobe`s ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" it manages to serve its purpose at being a terrifying and gruesome movie.

""Eaten Alive"" would've fared better if it had been filmed on location rather than the obvious sound stage.  The crocodile was extremely unrealistic.  In fact, there were several scenes where it looked like a miniature version was used in lieu of a life-size one.  Look closely at the scene where Snoopy the dog is about to be devoured.

There are big name stars in this movie such as Mel Ferrer and Carolyn Jones, but they are underused.  Marilyn Burns from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" spends much of her time tied to a bed.  A young Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" plays Buck, an oversexed, troublemaking redneck.

If you like movies about alligators and crocodiles on the rampage, rent or buy Tobe Hooper's ""Crocodile.""  It is definitely more entertaining than ""Eaten Alive.  In ""Crocodile,"" a group of teens are relentlessly pursued by a crocodile because one of them is unknowingly carrying her eggs.  The body count is high.  There are numerous mutilations as the teens are killed one by one.  Who will live and who will die?",1203897600,2,1868,4.771875
1256399,3,B00002ZMNF,"Eaten Alive (Tobe Hooper, 1977)

Hooper and Henkel, the team who brought you The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in 1974, returned three years later with their second feature, Eaten Alive. This one, too, is loosely based on a true story (that of Joe Ball, the Texas Bluebeard), but unlike TCM, which quite deservedly has gained classic status over the years, this one has faded into obscurity. And, sure, it's not a great movie, but then neither was TCM. In its way, Eaten Alive is just as riveting.

Much of that has to do with Neville Brand, who plays Judd, the psychotic hotel owner who enjoys cutting up his guests and feeding them to his pet gator. Brand's performance is one you just can't look away from. He's unnerving in his portrayal of a psychopath whose social veneer is so thin it's almost nonexistent. He's helped out by a surprisingly stellar cast for such a low-budget effort. While Hooper and Henkel fell back on some old standbys from their Texas Chainsaw days (most notably Marilyn Burns), the rest of the main cast is all sorts of star-studded. Brand is joined by Mel Ferrer (as a concerned father seeking his missing daughter, the first victim), Sisters's William Finley (perhaps the best role in the film other than Brand's, as the father of a family who checks into the hotel-- he's almost as nuts as Judd), Stuart Whitman (the county sheriff), Robert Englund, The Hills Have Eyes' Janus Blythe, The Addams Family's Carolyn Jones, and a host of others. There's a good bit of decent-to-fine acting in this flick, which has the same appealingly low-budget look and feel as Texas Chainsaw, not surprisingly, and a godawful sappy-country soundtrack which is credited to Hooper and Texas Chainsaw sound guy Wayne Bell. How fun can you get?

This one's a lot of fun, and deserve to be a great deal less obscure than it is. Rent with abandon, my minions! ***",1201564800,,1867,4.720858895705521
1256400,3,B00002ZMNF,"Tobe Hooper has had his moments.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece, the sequel is a pretty good time, Poltergeist is a really solid ghost picture... but on the flip side of things you also get the complete mess known as Lifeforce, the disastrous Spontaneous Combustion, and certainly last but not least, 2000's Crocodile (which made Lake Placid seem really good in comparison).  Eaten Alive is the first film he made after TCM and while it's not on that level, it is an entertaining and enjoyable watch (even if it's just once).  The movie chronicles the exploits of Judd (played completely over the top by Neville Brand) as he runs a dilapidated hotel out the the middle of Louisianna swampland (or is it Texas?).  From there on we watch a bizarre and eclectic group of people (including horror vet Robert Englund as white trash Buck ""who likes to fu..."" and the lovely Marilyn Burns as a wig sporting wife) to check in so that Judd has something to feed his ""pet"" crocodile.  Completely all over the place while still being slow paced and amusingly overacted, Eaten Alive's best asset is it's setting and atmosphere.  Just like how Tobe turned a desolate farm house into a living nightmare in TCM, here he is able to do nearly the same with the grimey hotel where everything takes place.  The movie is able to provide some good tension at times also, most notably the scene involving a young girl hiding from Judd underneath the hotel while simutaneously being hunted by his pet croc.  While far from a ""long lost classic"", Eaten Alive should provide enough to keep most horror fans happy (or mildly entertained) and wondering... what happened to Tobe Hooper?!  This special edition by Dark Sky (so nice it almost feels wasted on this film but...) is the one to get if you do plan on buying the DVD as it has a plethora of interesting extras including ""The Butcher of Elmendorf: The Legend of Joe Ball"" which details the true story on which this movie was based.",1193616000,,1972,4.676300578034682

1256402,3,B00002ZMNF,"I'm a fan of Tobe Hooper, but for some reason or another, I had never heard of this film until recently, so I bought it without watching it first. But to be honest with you, I wasn't expected much from this film. Usually, if a film is good, you have AT LEAST heard of it, and for myself being a big horror fan and not even hearing about this film before, I didn't think this movie wouldn't have that much to offer. And in many ways, I suppose I was right, but in some strange way, I ending up enjoying this film. The basic story isn't all bad. A crazy owner of the run-down Starlight Hotel terrorizes guests and feeds them to his pet Crocodile. Yeah, this story is very loosely based on the legend of a man who allegedly killed women and fed them to his pet Crocodiles in his backyard. (He did in fact kill at least 2 women, and did own crocodiles, but in all probability, this story of feeding humans to crocs is not true.) As far as acting, I feel its the highlight of the film. Veteran actor Neville Brand does a superb job as the crazy hotel owner, Judd. With his signature raspy, (and in this case, creepy) voice, his off-kilter mannerisms, and his incoherent ramblings to himself, this makes for one great character!! This film also includes the excellent Marilyn Burns, the sole survivor from Hooper's previous masterpiece, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a then very young, pre-Freddy, Robert Englund as the sex-crazed Buck, Kyle Richards (remembered as little Lindsey from the first Halloween film), Carolyn Jones, better known as the Addams family's Morticia. The only acting complaint I have is with the husband, played by William Finley. I have no idea what the writers were trying to get across with him. At first, he seems normal, then the character has some kind of mental episode in the hotel room, while Marilyn Burns' characters seems pretty much unaffected by it. The plot didn't bother to explain the reasoning behind this crazed outburst, and his performance just didn't seem to make any sense whatsoever. Anyway, another thing that I enjoyed was the music. In most cases, music being played throughout scenes bug me to no end. But for some reason or another, I actually thought it helped the film. I also got a kick out of some the lyrics to the songs being played...funny stuff! So I'm willing to bet with this film, either you'll enjoy the music or you'll hate it! Moving on, I feel what hurt this movie the most of that it was filmed on a soundstage, and not at actual locations. You can spot this from the first time you see the Hotel. The sets and the lighting throughout the film just seemed too fake to me. The way the film was shot does have the Texas Chainsaw feel to it, but by filming on a soundstage, it failed to capture much atmosphere or mood needed in films like these. I didn't particularly like the special effects done in the film either. The crocodile was used very sparingly, and you don't get to really see it a lot, which is just as well, because it looks pretty fake when you do get a glimpse of it. This 2-disc DVD special edition includes commentary by select cast members, oddly enough not Hooper nor Burns, a look back at the film with Tobe Hooper, interviews with Robert Englund and Marilyn Burns, a featurette about the legend of Joe Ball (where the idea of the film came from), and even stills of comment cards filled out by audience members after watching the movie in theaters. In the end, what you're left with is a decent B-horror flick with some weak plot points. There is definitely room for improvement, however, I don't know why I like this movie as much as I do. Maybe I'm just nostalgic, or maybe I'm a bit biased cause I'm a fan of Hooper, Burns, and Englund. If you're just a causal fan of the genre, you may want to pass on this one, but if you're a die hard horror fan, you should add this one to your collection as I did.",1191628800,2,3886,4.451612903225806

1256405,2,B00002ZMNF,"Initially the movie seemed to have some of Chainsaw Massacre's nonlinear slant and manic energy, but the lack of focus ultimately destroyed everything. The movie's random maniacal edge seemed overly contrived---perpetrated in the absence of any recognizable storyline. And hell, the crocodile just didn't get enough screen-time. Let's face it. The best actor in the entire movie was reprehensibly underplayed.

This whole swamp-laden mess roughly revolves around the picturesque Starlight Hotel, conspicuously built to overlook a croc-supporting deluge. At one point, an estranged family shows up and pays for a room. What follows next is a pointless psychotic diatribe between husband and wife. The wife, by the way, is Sally from Chainsaw Massacre. The husband ends up dead, the little girl ends up running and hiding, and Sally ends up tied to a bed in her underwear---which may have been provocative in some tawdry way were it not for the eyeliner and snot running down her flushed heaving face the entire time.

There's just no central drive or consistent storyline, and too many non-essential characters. At one point you do see a belligerent pre-Freddy-Freddy as he is gobbled wholesale by the expeditious crocodile. Pre-Freddy-Freddy's girlfriend looked to me like the same girl who played the recalcitrant member of the cannibal tribe from The Hills Have Eyes, but don't quote me on that, because I was quite drunk at the time.

Ultimately, the hotel's owner, Judd, deviant/killer/crockmaster/entrepreneur, ends up doing the headlong dash into the croc's gullet, and the mourners in Judd's tumultuous wake are very few and far between. As a villain, Judd translates to a queasy and unsatisfying hybrid between and estranged member of the Leatherface clan and one of the Blacks Widows from Every Which Way But Loose.

I don't know. This movie isn't like trying to sit through Hatred of a Minute or Las Vegas Blood Bath or Michael Bolton concert footage, but it's definitely not one of Tobe Hooper's crowning achievements. Still, you know, give the guy a break.",1149552000,8,2068,5.201201201201201

As the movie begins we're in a seedy bedroom of a `bawdy' house with a half-nekkid blonde woman and a man named Buck (Englund), who likes to...well, it rhymes with his name and begins with the letter `F'...seriously, this was how he introduced himself...anyway, turns out the girl is a `working girl', if you get my drift, and Buck is trying to put it to her in a very uncomfortable place (a little zoom zoom in the boom boom), but the girlie ain't going for it, and subsequently gets fired by her boss Miss Hattie (Jones).  She wanders the swampy countryside, coming upon the Starlight Hotel and meets the wild-eyed proprietor named Judd (Brand).  Now the Starlight is what some people might call `rustic', with it soiled, water damaged walls and furniture that looks like it was picked from other people's garbage...a real armpit loaded with hillbilly charm.  Oh yeah, Judd also happens to have a rather large gator penned up in the swamp out back (two guesses what he feeds it).  Anyway, after the girlie has an unfortunate meeting with the business end of a pitchfork and gets dumped in the swamp, various groups start showing up...a wayward family of three (with a little, annoying, yapping mutt), a man (Ferrer) and his daughter (Sinclaire), who happen to be searching for the girlie we met at the beginning of the film (she was his estranged daughter), and so on...I'm figuring Judd doesn't get a lot of return business given his tendency to hack the customers up with a scythe and feed them to his pet croc, which he does quite a bit throughout the night, that is when he's not rambling on crazy to himself, which he also does a lot.  Seems the more people show up, the crazier Judd gets, but hey, at the very least, one can always count on there being a vacancy at the Starlight Hotel...

I think the intent by the producer Rustam here was to try and follow up on the success of Hooper's previous film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, but the result feels rather derivative, lacking the complete sense of unease so thoroughly ingrained in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, possibly because Hooper had little, if anything, to do with the writing of this film.  They did manage to carry over the depraved seediness, misogynistic psychopathic behavior, and wanton. bloody violence, but not the heart, or spirit, of Hooper's previous movie, and without that, this feels exactly like what it is, a fuzzy copy of highly original and very frightening film.  I did like Brand in his role, but the movie tended to focus too much on his crazy ranting...yeah, we got it, he's insane...do we really need to spend some twenty odd minutes throughout having this aspect shown to us?  No...this is something made clear after spending five minutes with the character.  Due to this the pacing of the film feels choppy.  Normally the lulls would be used to drive the tension, as the viewer knows something is coming, but here, I felt little of that, so these periods just dragged on the story. And what was up with the various characters, who often seemed more off their rocker than Brand's character?  Check out William Finley's character, who brought his family to the hotel...what was his deal?  I don't mind the wacky characters, but they can be hard to identify with resulting in little investment from the viewer within the characters, and an overall lack of caring what happens to them.  This was not the case in Hooper's earlier film...you actually cared, and that made it that much more frightening when the characters were in danger.  Mel Ferrer really didn't have much of a part, but he did have one hell of an exit scene.  And what was up with Whitman's character, as the good ole boy, do nothing sheriff?  He seemed pretty pointless...Englund's character of Buck was pretty memorable, albeit derivative, in a red neckian way...yeah, lean over that railing to the croc pit a bit further, moron...perhaps I'm being overly critical of the film, but given some of Hooper's other works, I guess I was expecting a bit more than I would have if this were directed by a lesser known artist.  The attempt, overall, was solid (the atmosphere, the music, the violence), but the execution lacking, comparatively speaking...at the very least the film did have some good, all natural nekkidness in it, and that counts for something.

The picture on the Elite Entertainment DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), looks reasonably decent, but there are noticeable flaws throughout.  This didn't detract from the movie for me so much, but if you're looking for a pristine copy, you won't find it here.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo comes through well enough, and I had no complaints.  The only extra feature available is a theatrical trailer.

It has all the dark brooding atmosphere of that old video tape of a dated 70's horror movie you find hidden on the bottom shelf of a video rental store that is about to go bust.  With few moments to save it, this is a case of going through the motions and any serious comparison between this movie and Hooper's much more accomplished Texas Chainsaw Massacre is laughable.  The plot revolves around a hotel owner and his pet crocodile.  Predictably hotel guests have their stay shortened by the croc and of course the owner with his scythe.  There are bits and pieces that are worth watching such as the scythe through the neck scene.  The strong point of the movie is that it keeps delivering trashy action from start to finish.

1256411,3,B00002ZMNF,"I remember believing, once upon a time, that director Tobe Hooper parlayed the success of his cult horror film ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" into the chance to direct ""Poltergeist."" Now we know that Steven Spielberg had his handprints all over the latter film and that this 1976 bomb was Hooper's real follow-up to his cult classic. The plot is, pardon the expression, rather bare boned: Judd (Neville Brand) owns a dilapidated hotel out in the bayou called the Starlight Hotel. Not only is Judd psychotic, he has a hungry alligator as a pet who gets to feed on the unruly guests. Hmmm. So this is a film where innocent passersby are slaughtered by a crazy person; no new ground for Hooper here unless you think a pitchfork is significantly different from a chainsaw. Besides, the guests at this hotel might be innocent, but they are also stupid. If you daughter's dog was eaten by a giant alligator would you console her by booking a room at the nearby hotel? Judd has been back there in the bayou killing people for years apparently, but now he makes the mistake of killing the wrong person and her family comes looking for her. Hmmm. Somebody looking for their dead sister at a horror hotel; gee, that sure sounds familiar.

Somehow Carolyn Jones, Mortitia on ""The Addams Family,"" managed to be conned into this film to play the madam at the local brothel. Marilyn Burns from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is back to teach the new people how to scream in the film's one decent performance and you will no doubt recognize Robert Englund in the minor role of Buckthe redneck at the start of the film. The script never even addresses the question of why Judd is totally insane, which only proves that no excuse at all is worse than a really lame excuse. Even a DVD version presenting the film in the letterboxed format and including the theatrical trailer does not raise this bomb to worthy status. The fact that Hooper directed this film actually hurts it in my mind because we sure would have expected better from him. Instead he ends up being a one hit wonder. ""Eaten Alive"" was also passed off as ""Horror Hotel,"" ""Horror Hotel Massacre,"" ""Murder on the Bayou,"" ""Legend of the Bayou,"" ""Starlight Slaughter,"" and, in the United Kingdom, as ""Death Trap"" (But, a bomb by any other name...). If you are looking for Tobe Hooper's second best film, then check out ""The Funhouse"" instead of this one.",1095120000,,2392,4.681710213776722
1256412,2,B00002ZMNF,"This is considered to be director Tobe Hooper's ""Lost"" film. This could be because ""Eaten Alive"" was released under so many alternate titles...or it could be as simple as this film just isn't that great. Tobe Hooper seems to be with this film trying to create the same tension he did with his stunning Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but fails. Eaten Alive is actually very similar to TCM in many ways. Stray vistors vistit a remote hotel (not a farm house)only to be slayed by a psycho (not Leatherface) with a scyth (not a chainsaw) and then fed to his pet croc (not served up for supper). Neville Brand does a good job portraying the psychotic hotel owner, but his character does not seem to come off near as scary or relentless as the legendary Leatherface. I can see way Tobe Hooper decided to make this film. TCM was such a hit that he probably felt it to be safer to try to copy his success rather than try something different. Sadly this film disappeared from the box office never to be heard from again until the Elite DVD release. The DVD presention is very good, considering how rare this film is. It does have some scratches and color disortions, but its acceptable since the original negative probably hasn't been stored in the best of conditions over the years (it was probably stored in Tobe's basment until one day he decided to blow the dust off of it). This film is still a good buy for the curious horror fans out there.
On the up side about the film, I like how Tobe Hooper tried to ""liven"" up the film by using some unique lighting effects. These lighting effects are very similar to Dario Argento's Suspiria with the bright red and blues. Many consider Dario Argento to have started that whole ""unique"" lighting effect stuff, but Tobe Hooper actually beat him to the punch by two years! Maybe Eaten Alive was released before ""artsy"" horror films became popular.",1080345600,2,1876,4.56973293768546
1256413,2,B00002ZMNF,"Tobe Hooper's next film after the ubersuccess ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a mess of half realized ideas and a director who must have felt the pressure to top himself.
Neville Brand is Judd, who runs the Starlight Hotel on the outskirts of a small Texas town. Libby (Crystin Sinclaire), a novice hooker, runs away from Miss Hattie's (Carolyn Jones, in some awful pancake makeup) and takes refuge at the creepy hotel. She arrives at night, Judd figures out she was one of Miss Hattie's girls, and throws her in the swamp. The swamp out back of the hotel contains a giant crocodile, which eats almost everything that comes its way.
The film then falls into a pattern that constantly repeats itself. More patrons come to the hotel, Judd picks this night to go nuts, and the crocodile out back gets to eat more than his share. Roy (William Finley) and his family arrive, Libby's dad (Mel Ferrer) and her sister arrive, Buck (Robert Englund) arrives, the sheriff arrives, my impatience arrives, etc.
While the crocodile attacks are very good (Hooper wisely keeps the shots dark), and the gore effects are okay, the script is a mess. Why did Judd pick this night to go bonkers? Has he been killing people all these years, or just now? The constant predictability kills the suspense.
Neville Brand, one of Hollywood's greatest underrated character actors, does a good job here until his performance eventually becomes stale. I am still trying to figure out why Carolyn Jones is covered in the horrible makeup, even her character is a little unnecessary. Poor Mel Ferrer does his best, but he has appeared in so many of these B horror movies, he looks totally bored. Robert Englund is good, his opening line is memorable, but his character is also just a small minded caricature.
""Eaten Alive"" is by no means a great horror film, but if anything, it is a hundred times better than Hooper's later ""Crocodile,"" one of the worst films ever made.",1074643200,3,1938,4.753709198813056
1256414,1,B00002ZMNF,"When Tobe Hooper released ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in 1974, people went wild over this up and coming horror film director. That movie, replete with a chainsaw wielding lunatic clad in human pelts and oppressive atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a...well, a chainsaw, proved to be effective on so many levels that it takes multiple viewings just to absorb the whole thing. I still see reviews about this movie raving about the heavy gore content, which is hilarious because Hooper's psychological thriller is bloodless. People THINK they saw buckets of gore because the disturbing and ultra seedy feel of the picture encourages a false memory that surely a film this twisted must contain gallons of sauce. When the time came to follow up this winner with another stellar contribution to the horror genre, Tobe bequeathed ""Eaten Alive"" to the cinematic world. The result was a resounding thud. ""Eaten Alive"" is an abomination; it is a flaccid, wretched attempt to recreate the magic Hooper reaped from that family of lively cannibals in Texas. This movie is so bad that it literally hurts the brain to watch it in its entirety.
Out in the bayou there is the Starlight Motel, run by a mumbling, stumbling psychotic named Judd (Neville Brand). Good old Judd doesn't get out all that much, seeing as how he has to tend to his decrepit property and feed the alligator he keeps in a pond in front of the inn. Heck, once in awhile he even sees a guest or two show up and rent a room for the night. This is fine for Judd and his pet alligator because this innkeeper knows there is a whole lotta sin out there in the world that needs fixing, and he is just the sort of man to do it. Judd's keen eye can even tell when one of the women of the night from the brothel in town turns up for the evening, as we see at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately for the owner of the Starlight, that lady has a family who actually cares about her whereabouts, and it isn't too long before her Dad (Mel Ferrar) and sister turn up in town asking a bunch of pesky questions. The sheriff of the town isn't too worried about this disappearance, nor is Miss Hattie, the madam at the local house of ill repute (Carolyn Jones). Throw in a local yokel with a penchant for pool halls, women, and booze (played by Robert Englund in one of his first roles) and a family who turns up at the Starlight during this whole mess (with the Mom played by Hooper alum Marilyn Burns), and you have all the trimmings of ""Eaten Alive.""
I will admit some of the murders are a wee bit entertaining. I will even admit that the idea of a pet alligator tearing some poor schlep to pieces has some allure. I will further admit that ""Eaten Alive"" is a terrible, boring piece of trash that entertaining murders and hungry gators cannot redeem. A large part of the problem with this film falls squarely on the shoulders of the cast. Englund provides precious few reasons to watch this film, and it is more than a bit surprising that he managed to get work after appearing in this dreck. Carolyn Jones, who played the erotic Morticia Addams (admit it; she was something to look at!) in the seminal television series, appears in the part of Miss Hattie. What an embarrassing appearance! Her entire shtick relies on her roaming around wearing a huge ball cap while blurting out nonsensical statements. Mel Ferrar, quite simply, should have known better. Marilyn Burns rehashes her ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" role here without any of the amazing verve she showed in that movie. The real death knell of ""Eaten Alive"" is Neville Brand as the mentally dyspeptic Judd. Large sections of the film reveal nothing except Brand ambling around his lodgings mumbling his lines in Esperanto or some equally obscure language. It sure as heck wasn't English because I didn't understand a word this guy said. Attention casting director, screenwriter, and actors of ""Eaten Alive"": Have you no sense of decency, sirs, at long last? Have you no sense of decency?
If you need any additional proof that ""Eaten Alive"" flatlines, look no further than the incredibly inept pacing. What was Tobe Hooper thinking when he let scenes run on this long without a satisfying resolution? How long does that little girl crawl around under the porch? Marilyn Burns screams and screams while bound on a bed for what seems like an eternity. Judd listens to country and western records while rambling in Sanskrit FOREVER. While we're at it, lets mention the awful lighting effects and the red tinted sky. In what part of this world is there a place where the sky is red all of the time? I'm not even going to go into as much depth as I should in describing the horribly cheesy looking alligator in Judd's pond except to say that is horrible and not in a good way cheesy. Watching this film was the equivalent of a surgeon performing your liver transplant with a pair of tweezers.
In the final analysis, ""Eaten Alive"" definitely ranks as one of the worst films I have ever seen. Nothing works here in any way, shape, or form. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of the film is that Tobe Hooper managed to get more work afterwards. He went on to assist in the making of ""Poltergeist"" and helmed the intriguing ""Lifeforce"" in the 1980s. He still works today, although one hopes that he occasionally wakes up in a cold sweat for having produced this car wreck.",1070582400,4,5372,4.602711157455683

I'll say this, you can tell that Tobe Hooper had his hand in this because it defintely has its disturbing parts. As you might expect, they don't involve the rubber alligator; the creepiest scene in my opinion is the initial dialogue between the family staying in the Starlight Hotel. What a sick, all-too-plausible character the husband is! The wife asks him, ""Do you just want to feed us to the alligator? (in a lower voice) Is that what you want?"" The husband replies by making a ""chomping"" motion with his hands over and over, and all you want is for the alligator to eventually get him.

The first time I heard of ""Eaten Alive"" was during the home movie spurt of the eighties. My dad and I were watching the trailers to a movie we rented. During the trailer for this I remember my dad exclaiming, ""Wait! These are great actors! What are they doing in THIS?"" It's funny, my dad doesn't analyze film. He's a very intelligent man, but when it comes to movies he would prefer to be entertained and move on with his day. Despite this my dad seemed to understand what the point of this movie was: pointless, random violence. Hooper could have used my dad's help as Hooper didn't seem to understand the point as well as my dad. I know now, thanks to IMDB, that actors can't only be in great movies. They will take jobs where they can unless they are superstars. The second time I saw the trailer I was in my early teens a number of years later. I was fascinated by it! It looked like brutal, pointless violence. I wanted to see it so bad! Perhaps it was my age. Well I can say now that it was DEFINITELY pointless and the brutal violence was mainly against the audience!
Everywhere the characters went looked like a studio both indoors and out. A far cry from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Now I'll say that this was a contributing factor to the lack of tension but it wasn't the only reason. In truth Hooper just couldn't deliver tension. He clearly had the skill to, he just couldn't muster it for this one.
Occasionally the antagonist would mumble these monologs to himself. Were these supposed to be insane ravings, insightful musing, or exposition? What I know for certain is that they were boring and uninspired.
Hooper stated clearly that ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was his interpretation of the ethos of Texas. What's his excuse for ""Eaten Alive?"" I think his movies tell us more about him than the environments and judgments he casts down on others. I don't believe Hooper liked what he saw in himself so he blamed outward sources. Of course this is speculation so I won't draw conclusions from it but I don't accept his narrative and tacit conclusions that he doesn't have free will when it comes to objectionable material. The responsibility resided solely with himself.
A credit to Hooper is his willingness to operate out of emotion and feelings. I actually think it was quite courageous. If I was given a budget I would want everything planned out perfectly and that can lead to a sterile, wooden experience for the audience. Unfortunately Hooper's intuitive efforts was a bane for ""Eaten Alive."" Any sense of story de-evolves rather quickly. Scenes are basically pointless and disconnected and not in an intelligent or artistic way that one might expect from dream logic or abstraction. No, the film just wallows in a pointless stupor.
Robert Englund was great as usual. I have never seen him in something where I didn't like him.
What I was hoping for was the brilliance of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" at best or so-bad-it's-good at worst. My expectations were defied and was left with a pointless, boring experience. I did try to be as objective as I could and not compare it to my previous encounter with a Hooper film but I'm not sure how successful I was to be honest.

-seeing old actors in a crappy movie can be fun
-Robert Englund

7916327,3,B00002ZMNF,Oh the review for the movie is 2 to 3 stars I vaguely remember it nostalgic factor its humorous it has the 70s thing happening for it in her in a really good really bad way but this is by no means it to this special edition of this movie which took me two weeks to realize it so I really don't care the price was right just to be informative if it had the other disk I don't know that I would watch it not for this particular title creature double feature heavily edited It was good to see it on cut with some blood for the first time but other than that they know nothing particularly great about this one a lot of the same people a big crocodile dinner entertainment if you're looking at these kind of movies you know what it is,1521504000,,730,4.006849315068493

7916330,2,B00002ZMNF,"I doubt it would have ever got a bit of attention. It is not a good movie, quite frankly. However, it has that Texas ""charm"" that only many nights of smoking that south Texas weed in a group of screenwriters can bring. The acting is not good, particularly from the main actor. The atmosphere is Hooper, but it is SO underlit and ""red"" as to make many scenes ineffective, and I'm sure intentionally so so as to hide the fake reptile in scenes where it appeared.

The story is hard to understand, and the hotel owner cannot speak. It just falls flat other than just being a piece of the Tobe Hooper claim to fame. And a poor one at that.",1514937600,,635,4.24793388429752
