7723686,5,B01DSXGCF2,"I have 3 little ones that I watch, and they absolutely love this video!

Lately everyday we've been watching a lot of Mickey Mouse and Little Einstein's. These shows do a little bit of teaching, but not much and I feel like for Pre K they need a little more then what they're getting. That's why this video is great. They love that they are learning and they are still having fun. It is worth it to get these DVD's for young children that don't know their alphabet or their numbers yet. I feel like it really helps to prepare them for when they start Pre K, and they are a little ahead of schedule.",1470614400,8,598,4.2
7723697,5,B01DSXGCF2,This is the only show that our child will pay attention to and that is awesome because he is also learning. Great material.,1506556800,,123,4.391304347826087
7723698,5,B01DSXGCF2,Very educational movies. My 5 year old and 2 year old have learned so much from watching these leapfrog movies. Within a week or so they could tell me all the letter sounds. Leapfrog makes it very easy to remember what sounds the letter makes by making them into charters. We bought more movies.,1506297600,,295,4.481481481481482

7723704,3,B01DSXGCF2,"Didn't capture my two year old son attention. He doesn't want to watch it, like he does the School of Rock ABC Video.  My there so wasn't thrilled about it either. He was four when I purchased this video for him.",1489536000,2,212,4.170731707317073

8756816,1,B01DSXGCF2,"I purchased the 3 dvd set, abc, 123, and learning to read.  This product turned up when I searched for ""interactive"" learning tools. Basic R's require repeated drills and child's engagement to the process.  I was expecting the composition to be a structured progressive process of mental building and natural reinforcement of associative success learning, like simple but effective matching game.  These products are NOT interactive.  They are not even programmed staged, self point and shoot learning.  Each video is a long play cartoon.  The only response is to watch.  There is no question and answer prompts to stimulate child to reach and grasp.  The videos are just one long play.  They are not serialized, to dwell on lesson points.  They are no toss up of lesson quizzes.  No game challenge.  The kid has no interest to sit through the video because the abc's and 123's are flashed with out associating any meaning.  It is a kind of product that can not be even given away.  No utility.",1530489600,,994,4.839285714285714
