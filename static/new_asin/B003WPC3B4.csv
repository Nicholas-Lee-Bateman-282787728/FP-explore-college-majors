8600960,4,B003WPC3B4,"love the nero wolfe DVDs great show  -  but I already own series one and this was advertised as three 3.  but is in fact one 1.
I am totally dissatisfied with the seller firstly for misleading me and secondly for failing to respond to my communication to exchange it.
they do not respond, and do not state clearly that their refund policy differs from the Amazon site; it should be the same as Amazon if selling under this site.
it also cost $47.00 in mail so I am super out of pocket with no product.
BAD form seller. do not be hoodwinked here.",1291334400,12,545,4.221153846153846
