You can learn the same skills illustrated in this dvd by searching google and watching videos on youtube.  The 50 minute dvd could have been cut down to 30 minutes or less if they cut out long segments showing Terry swimming with little or no instruction.  If you decide you want to learn and apply the methods in this dvd, save your money and borrow it from your local library instead.",1347580800,5,484,4.228260869565218

3071379,1,B00120WGUO,"This DVD should be cut into guitar picks. It is just worthless. Like so many swimmers, I have a problem breathing while doing freestyle. My form is great, I should win a freakin' medal, but I get terribly winded after 2 laps and need to switch to breastroke or to stop altogether. I've tried every trick in the book but can't lick this problem. I thought this DVD would address this problem. It doesn't. It assumes you have never seen water before and laboriously instructs you how to stroke in the water. There is NO advice on exhaling in the water, proper breathing techniques, drills, NOTHING. It's just dreadful and prosaic. Besides that it was great.",1298332800,9,655,4.655172413793103

3071381,2,B00120WGUO,"First of all, I love Total Immersion and have been using Terry Laughlin's methods for years, even before everyone else started copying him!  As the hardest part of swimming, no matter what the method, is the breathing part, I looked forward to this new DVD.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  There was not much new here, just a reworking of the same material in Terry Laughlin's other (very good) DVD's.  Not enough depth into each topic, lots of views of Terry in an Endless Pool with some occasional poor form to boot.

8243454,4,B00120WGUO,"This dvd helps understanding the breathing process while swimming.  It is integral in the ""Total Immersion"" swimming philosophy.
I have recently found the ""Smooth Swimming"" approach which agrees with some and contradicts other skills in Total Immersion.  I am finding the Smooth Swimming approach more helpful.  For example, the advice to constantly exhale under water to eliminate as much CO2 as possible has worked better for me.  So, Terry Laughlin's approach may work for some and not others.  It is helpful to watch this dvd, but continue searching other sources.",1422489600,4,568,5.266666666666667
