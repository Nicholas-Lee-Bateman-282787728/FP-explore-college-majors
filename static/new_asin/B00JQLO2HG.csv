8653335,5,B00JQLO2HG,"Ingenious - heart-warming - ballbreakingly funny  entertaining to the end  Felix Herngren's ""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared"" on BLU RAY is all of these things and more. Based on the best-selling book by Jonas Jonasson - think ""Amelie"" meets ""Forest Gump"" meets The Coen Brothers (firing on all sixes) but filmed in Swedish. What a breath of fresh air this wonderful film is...

It goes like this. While a butch matron heads towards Allan Karlsson's bedroom holding a marzipan cake loaded down with a sea of lighted candles - the aged but still sane Allan (played to perfection by Robert Gustafsson) climbs out the window of his enforced retirement home and does a Birthday bunk. A few minutes later  he's in his night robe and cork slippers entering a quiet bus station. There he meets a young but extraordinarily dim tattooed thug called Hinken (Sven Lonn) with a large garish suitcase who tells him crudely to 'mind' his luggage while he takes a leak in the tiny stationhouse loo that won't accommodate both him and his heavy load. But the slightly befuddled Allan is 100-years old and no longer has patience for such crap  he only wants to catch a bus leaving in three minutes to some tiny Swedish town (a one-way ticket he purchased only moments earlier with his pocket change). The problem is that Allan doesn't understand what's 'in' the pink suitcase and how valuable it is until he teams up with another old-timer Julius at the bus-stop end (played by the famous Swedish actor Iwar Wiklander). Whacked over the head with a crocket mallet  Julius puts the aforementioned thug Hinken (comes looking for his suitcase) in a home refrigeration unit on full and thereafter all Hell breaks loose once Hinken's minders don't hear from their twit.

Along the way we flashback to a younger Allan Karlsson who somehow manages to affect the lives of countless hapless eejets from history (loads of cleverly woven-in famous names) - while engaging in his true lifelong passion  blowing things up with dynamite (a fox who killed his cat, toilets in the back yard and bridges in a Spanish war). There are dancing Communist dictators, a talkative ironmonger whose the first to get shot, Ronald Reagans gardener reasoning with the 1980s howdy-doody President about 'his wall needing to come down' (thereby planting in his addled actors brain the famous phrase he said to Mikhail Gorbachev about the Berlin Wall), Allan advising Oppenheimer and his Manhattan Project team in a non-nonsense way how to detonate the biggest bomb of them all, acquiring American President Trumans cigarette lighter after a drunken dinner and then giving it to the son of a double-agent in the Cold War, Franco's near-death experience on a Spanish bridge, Herbert Einstein (Albert's extraordinarily dimmer brother) ending up with Allan in a Russian Gulag (displeased Stalin during a vodka/dancing session) and a British drug dealer living by his pool in tropical Bali (Alan Ford playing Pim) who wants his 50 million back or someones gonna be dinner  and not in a gourmet kind of way.

Meanwhile back in the now - Allan also has to deal with Benny (David Wiberg) - the weedy non-committal driver he and Julius enlist to escape the bad guys. Benny can't seem to finish any University Degree he starts let alone a cohesive sentence (he's done 30 degrees or more in his need for knowledge he can't use) - not to mention Benny's unspoken lust for the feisty but pretty Gunilla (Mia Skaringer) - a Swedish chalet owner who keeps an elephant in her barn that her psychotic ex-boyfriend stole from a circus when they weren't looking. Meanwhile hot on all their trails is the aging Swedish Chief Inspector Aronsson  who can't tell his arse from his elbow and just wants an easy life (a stunning understated panic-stricken performance by Ralph Carlsson). The effect of all this lunatic goings-on is to keep the story moving along nicely while at the same time remaining endlessly entertaining...and very, very funny...

While they're speaking Swedish there's English subtitles on the bottom of the screen  except while Alan Ford speaks  his dialogue is all in English (plays Pim the British gangster  he was Bricktop in Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch""). The BLU RAY picture is gorgeous throughout (bars top and bottom though) and even when the story is flashing back to so many world locations  the clarity never lets up. The facial close ups of various nutjobs have great presence and somehow add immensely to the whole madcap feel of the film.

""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared"" should have been Oscar-nominated for script and won  but you can glean just how good it is by the fact that almost all five of its worldwide nominations have been 'Audience Awards' - which speaks the volumes about this gem the so-called critics arent. And who would have thought the Sweeds could be this funny.

Put it high on your rental/to buy list and thoroughly enjoy...",1443052800,,4977,4.882562277580071
8653336,5,B00JQLO2HG,"""...Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared,"" or ""Hundraringen som klev ut genom fnstret och frsvann,"" whichever suits you best. This entry from Sweden (English captions when necessary) is my first rave review from the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. This black, black comedy played to a packed house; it generated howls of laughter throughout, then thunderous applause when it ended. Some of us laughed all the way home on the bus, too.

Director Felix Herngren crafted a brilliant script along with Hans Ingemansson, which was based on Jonas Jonasson's novel about a Zelig-type fellow who loves blowie uppie stuff. Over the course of this hilarious film, we see him with General Franco of Spain, Josef Stalin, Harry Truman, Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer of the Manhattan Project, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and others I failed to note at the time.

The movie starts when his beloved cat is killed by a fox...which he promptly blows up, and it goes on from there. The marvelous script unfolds in a logical way, it just sounds so unlikely!

We follow:
  * Robert Gustafsson as Allan Karlsson (brilliant award-winning makeup!), as he ages from a young man who suffers an unfortunate surgery to a very elderly man who loves aquavit or vodka. He has a very simplistic world view and tends to let the big issues roll right off his back.
  * Iwar Wiklander as Julius, the cordial fellow who helps our hero with his unwieldy suitcase (you should see how he came by THAT!) and dispose of that pesky corpse.
  * David Wiberg is Benny, a perpetual student who never finishes anything he starts. He needs a firm hand.
  * Mia Skringer is Gunilla, who has a very firm hand (and an elephant)!
  We also have a terrific supporting cast: a law enforcement officer trying to make sense of the case; an infuriated mob boss demanding that suitcase (if only his thugs could find it!); that other corpse in Djibouti; the elephant who sits on a gunman; plus numerous other lowlifes, thugs and molls.

Little touches, like the music's exact match to Allan's footsteps, the cars and clothes that perfectly suit each time period, the senior discount for the bus ticket. It goes on and on....

SEE THIS FILM OR BUY THE DVD. I'M WAITING FOR REGION 1 SO I CAN LOAN MINE OUT!",1413504000,,2279,4.763358778625954
