4573379,1,B0055CP9LS,"I think it should be clearly stated when an ""animated feature"" is actually a motion comic. I didn't make it through the first 10 minutes of this, because it felt like I was watching something crafted out of construction paper, on PBS, in the 60s.",1418860800,,246,4.488888888888889

4573382,1,B0055CP9LS,Why let a company buy a comic/story and do half the work animating it while selling it at full price? This could have been an excellent animated movie but end up coming off very cheaply. A good story doesn't make up for subpar animation. This is all out laziness and a quick cash grab. This might have been fine if it were a toss-in special feature to a larger product like a movie or USF4 unlock but it's not worth buying on its own.,1411689600,,434,4.178571428571429
4573383,3,B0055CP9LS,I liked the story line but I didn't like the fact of it being computer generated. Other than that it was ok.,1384300800,,108,3.9545454545454546

4573386,1,B0055CP9LS,"Word or warning, this is a motion comic, not an animated movie. It collects issues 7-12 of some Street FIghter comic series (in tiny print on the back cover bottom). This should be marked better or in books, not as an anime film.

On the plus, the comics have great artwork. Just was excited for a new SF anime and got this instead at an overpriced $15 no less.",1316044800,23,361,4.231884057971015

4573431,3,B0055CP9LS,"It's a motion comic, so I don't expect the best animation quality, but this often just seemed lazily animated and could have been better-looking as just still comic panels.  The story is a prequel to SF4, and as fighting games go, this is yet another retelling of the classic Street Fighter tale.",1473552000,,296,4.6923076923076925

4573482,1,B0055CP9LS,Don't be fooled by the nice anime looking cover. This is not a professional cartoon. Nor is it anime. It looks like it was drawn by a child.

Almost each scene is played like those annoying recorded videos on the internet where the person never turned their phone sideways so you get terrible views.  Yeah... Like that.  On top of that, the animation looks like an amateur production company.

If you like that, this is ok.  Personally, I feel UDON's art doesn't lend itself to be cut up and moved around.  The comic style is very dynamic but in a static form.

4573705,4,B0055CP9LS,Much improved animation and sound quality from the first (They actually pronounce names right). I don't think the story was as interesting as the first. Also Akuma is on the front cover but not in the movie.,1419292800,,207,4.621621621621622
4573706,1,B0055CP9LS,Not at all fun to watch. Just illustrations with moving lips and sound effects.,1419120000,,79,4.714285714285714
8457919,2,B0055CP9LS,"This is a motion comic, not a fully animated feature. Basically, an artist or two, drew up the characters and backdrops, while another set of artists, took those static comic drawings and did their best to animate them.  The results are.... well... not so good. First off, the artwork itself is very inexperienced and I don't mean to bash the artist's work.
They have poor anatomical structure, warped perspective and all of it sits within a bad composition. The only redeemable quality in the art, is the color palette used, to make the images pop.

The static animation, is sometimes hysterical but at other times, it does a good job at setting a mood.  The action sequences is where this motion comic suffers the most. It would benefit more, if the artists at least took some time to animate the character's mouths, when delivering their dialogue, but I supposed these were put together in a pinch.

I think motion comics have potential, but it will greatly depend on the content's style a story.  Maybe if they could mix motion comics with minimal cell animation, this one in particular, may not have been so bad.",1522800000,,1117,4.737113402061856

8457921,5,B0055CP9LS,Yes it did good just wish if there gonna do the whole series then just do it as a one take collection or vol but other wise good no problems,1517875200,,140,3.7
8457922,1,B0055CP9LS,OMG Why would you go thru all the trouble of making a full length animated film in the style of an animated comic book. The inconsistency of the movement speeds with the characters and the first 30 MINUTES of EXPOSITION! Don't waste your time ... unless you just like doing that sort of thing.,1515974400,,293,4.444444444444445

8457927,1,B0055CP9LS,All Motion Comics need to be taken out and BURNED AND BURIED.  It's worse than the Marionettes of the Thunderbirds. I can't and won't watch this type of production regardless of story or theme.,1475193600,,193,4.676470588235294
