4229846,3,B003YJJT1U,"Deanna Durbin was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during her years there (1937-1948) and is reported to have saved Universal Pictures from bankruptcy. The five films in this TCM box set offer a cross-section of nearly the full span of her career, from her third and fourth starring vehicles, made when she was 15 and 16, to her very last film, made when she was 26. The youthful charm and buoyancy that made her so popular, combined with her beautiful lyric soprano voice, are clearly on full display in the first three films in the set. The fourth shows the difficulty she had in finding suitable adult roles, while the fifth, her last film, actually finds her in such a role.

Durbin has not been as successful at attracting new audiences over the years as her onetime rival, Judy Garland. Durbin's constant upbeat demeanor was fun for a while but often seemed completely out of touch with reality, a fact that became more glaring the older she got. Garland's performances, on the other hand, revealed a sense of yearning and incompleteness, an undercurrent of pain that has spoken to audiences, particularly creative, wounded souls, in every generation. Deanna never seemed to really need anything or anyone, so we find ourselves at more of a distance from her nowadays. Still, she was a remarkable and unusual screen personality who could be quite enchanting in her early films. I've always been fascinated by her and was grateful for the chance to discover these five films.

MAD ABOUT MUSIC (1938) Deanna plays an American in a Swiss girls' school who's been virtually abandoned by her Hollywood movie star mother and who makes up stories about a nonexistent father who's supposedly a famous explorer. When she's caught in a lie about her father arriving in town to see her, she has to recruit a visiting composer (Herbert Marshall) to play the role for her. Deanna's stock in trade was persuading older men to do all kinds of things, so he agrees to go along with it. The film opens with a remarkable bicycling scene as Deanna and her schoolmates ride together on a country road (with the Alps seen in the background thanks to movie magic) singing ""I Love to Whistle.""

THAT CERTAIN AGE (1938) Deanna and her friends, including Jackie Cooper, decide to ""put on a show,"" setting up the template for the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland musicals that MGM put into production a year later, starting with BABES IN ARMS. Here, the kids' production is derailed when Deanna throws over Jackie to become infatuated with a swashbuckling foreign correspondent (Melvyn Douglas) who happens to be her parents' summer houseguest. Deanna is a force of nature in her early films and she seems to get everything she wants simply by willing it...although the visiting journalist here ultimately has his own ideas. Jackie's lovelorn disposition throughout will break your heart.

THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP (1939) This is a follow-up to Deanna's first film (THREE SMART GIRLS, 1937) and it finds Deanna getting involved in her two older sisters' mismatched love lives. She's got the right idea about who should be with whom, but she goes about it the wrong way. She doesn't seem to have any sense of boundaries. Her extreme mood swings would be diagnosed today as bipolar, yet this was considered endearing at the time. There's a sort of deus ex machina ending which sets everything right, but defies all logic in the process. Absurd from start to finish, but fast-paced and beautifully shot. Helen Parrish, the resident mean girl at the Swiss school in THAT CERTAIN AGE, plays Kay, one of the sisters, and she gives Deanna a very public well-deserved slap in the face in one scene.

BECAUSE OF HIM (1946) There's a seven-year gap in this box set and when we next see Deanna, she's an aspiring actress with a much older love interest. Employed as a waitress, she uses lies, deceit and a forged letter to wangle a meeting with a Broadway star and a top playwright and somehow gets cast in the lead of their new play. Charles Laughton, who'd co-starred with Deanna in IT STARTED WITH EVE (1941), plays the actor, John Sheridan, in high style, but we're never quite convinced that he sees anything of note in this presumptuous young lady. She sings ""Danny Boy"" for him and he casts her on that basis. (A more logical response would have been: Why don't you try to be a singer and not an actress?) Granted, the fact of the playwright's (Franchot Tone) romantic interest in her plays a role in all this and leads to a rather bizarre piece of improvisation at the play's end on opening night in the film's final minutes. It's an odd film and I found the moral implications of the waitress-turned-actress's unprincipled behavior quite disturbing.

FOR THE LOVE OF MARY (1948) Deanna plays a switchboard operator at the White House and has to juggle three suitors, with the help and frequent intervention of the President and four Supreme Court justices. So basically, the entire executive and judicial branches shut down to help negotiate Deanna's love life. The suitors are played by Don Taylor (scientist), Jeffrey Lynn (lawyer), and Edmond O'Brien (Navy officer). Various other older men get involved, including the President's Secretary (Ray Collins), a newspaper publisher (Frank Conroy), and an immigrant restaurant owner (Hugo Haas) who's trying to become a citizen. It's silly, but amusing and well-played, and Deanna seems to have found the right pitch for playing a single adult woman. However, this was her last film. She settled her contract with Universal Pictures, married her third husband, French director Charles David, and moved with him to an early retirement in France in 1950. She never looked back.

If you're already a Deanna fan, you'll want this set. If you're just curious about her, you might want to start with the six-film Deanna Durbin Sweetheart Pack, which has some of her better films--FIRST LOVE, IT STARTED WITH EVE, CAN'T HELP SINGING and LADY ON A TRAIN.

Her voice is golden, but one can hear it getting stronger and stronger toward the end of her movie career. Despite the fact that clearly she didn't relish making movies all that much, quitting Hollywood completely so young, one would never know it from watching her glittering smiles and her bright humor.

I have always thought she was an incredibly talented singer and actress and these movies just solidify my opinion. Her golden voice is always a pleasure to listen to, but the story lines are fabulous even if they weren't in a musical setting. My two favorites are ""That Certain Age"" and ""For the Love of Mary"". Watching Deanna love struck over Melvin Douglas and her adolescent schemes to make him fall in love with her are absolutely adorable. My husband and I also laugh hysterically at the mess Deanna gets in while trying to balance the White House switchboard in ""For the Love of Mary"". The other three movies, ""Mad About Music"", ""3 Smart Girls Grow Up"", and ""Because of Him"" are hilarious and touching as well with great actors like Charles Laughton, Arthur Treacher, Helen Parrish, Robert Cummings, and Don Taylor.

8409492,4,B003YJJT1U,"What's this? A quote from TCM host Robert Osborne about Deanna Durbin? He states: ""She was a teenager playing a teenager, dressed as teenagers dressed in those days, but few teens ever had been able to hit those high singing notes that she could."" Back in the 1930s and early '40s, it was Deanna Durbin - and not Judy Garland - who was Hollywood's darling and America's sweetheart, never mind that she was Canadian. And in her heyday she was a bigger box office attraction than even Shirley Temple. Deanna projected a radiant wholesomeness; she had this unaffected quality. And gifted? Say, haven't you heard her sing? Her fabulous soprano voice soars so winsomely angels would weep, maybe tear off their wings in jealous fits... or to put it in a more down-to-earth fashion, Deanna Durbin could sing the hell out of a song.

DEANNA DURBIN - THE MUSIC AND ROMANCE COLLECTION offers up five mostly terrific, hard-to-find movies starring Deanna Durbin, the teenaged girl what pulled reeling Universal Studios out of bankruptcy. And as you'll see, what makes her movies so watchable is that they aren't primarily just vehicles for her to sing. These movies deliver plot and humor and fine acting and that incomparable feel of Americana, and, yes, they occasionally showcase Ms. Durbin's phenomenal singing talents. Presenting each movie on its own disc, Turner Classic Movies does a proper solid for all Deanna Durbin fans. TCM even loans out Robert Osborne for intro honors for each film.

- MAD ABOUT MUSIC (1938)

It's Deanna Durbin's third feature film. At this stage, Deanna was only sixteen years old but she already counted as Universal's most bankable star. And you can see why in MAD ABOUT MUSIC, one of her best (and most uproarious) musicals. The film plot goes like this: To maintain her glamour girl image, world-renowned movie actress Gwen Taylor (Gail Patrick) is persuaded by her agent to conceal her 14-year-old daughter, Gloria Harkinson, in a Swiss boarding school. To keep her true identity a secret, Gloria invents a fictitious father, claiming him to be a globe-trotting explorer and big game hunter. But you and I know this deception won't hold water for long, especially when a rival student begins to snoop around.

Pressured to produce her fictional dad, Gloria coaxes a visiting composer (Herbert Marshall) to play the role. And I have to mention that this is the least stuffy I've seen Herbert Marshall. His chemistry with Durbin is amazing. I never laughed harder or longer than during those early scenes in which Marshall is first going along with the charade. He does the most exquisite double takes. And you can't discount Deanna's performance, which is absolutely delightful. Her character thinks fast on her feet, and I snicker at how, as per Gloria Harkinson, each complication so very earnestly falls within the category of life and death."" Hey, quick, what are the odds that Gloria's mom and the fake dad will get together?

Songs include ""A Serenade to the Stars,"" ""Chapel Bells,"" three versions of ""I Love to Whistle"" (including a really fun one with Cappy Barra's Harmonica Ensemble), and Durbin's rendition of ""Ave Maria."" MAD ABOUT MUSIC co-stars character actors William Frawley as the shady agent and the splendid Arthur Treacher who - surprise! - plays a butler.

Bonus features: an intro by TCM host Robert Osborne; an interview with John Pasternak who talks about Deanna Durbin and his brother, movie producer Joe Pasternak, who more or less discovered Deanna (00:07:29 minutes long); Behind the Scenes photos; lobby cards; publicity stills; movie posters; and an article & bio from the TCM Database.

- THAT CERTAIN AGE (1938)

This one predates the Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland musicals, and in fact may have even inspired MGM to put together its own teen-oriented ""Let's put on a show"" picture. When dapper foreign correspondent Vincent Bullitt (Melvyn Douglas), recuperating from his recent outing in the Spanish Civil War, is invited to stay at newspaper tycoon Gilbert Fullerton's home for a stint of peace and quiet, peace and quiet elude him like a mother. It's all to do with Fullerton's teenaged daughter Alice (Durbin). Alice and her friends are putting on a show and rehearsing in her family's guest house, but then they're told to halt production to accomodate the recovering reporter. Alice and the gang play pranks on the poor gent to try to get him to leave. But this is Melvyn Douglas they're bracing, and he brings with him an indomitable pencil mustache and that worldly flair. Alice is soon smitten, never mind that her almost boyfriend (Jackie Cooper) is glaring daggers. Vincent, for an observant reporter, spends most of the film clueless about Alice's crush, and when it does finally dawn on him, he may find it hard going to dissuade a girl of ""that certain age.""

I think this may be the film in which Deanna belts out the most tunes. She performs ""Be A Good Scout,"" ""You're As Pretty As A Picture,"" ""My Own,"" ""Daisy"" (a brief duet she sings acapella with Melvyn Douglas) and the classical pieces ""Les Filles de Cadiz"" and ""Je veux vivre dans ce reve,"" an aria from the opera Romeo et Juliette. THAT CERTAIN AGE, enlivened by a lively cast, chugs along at a good pace and hits those predictable beats. But it's not my favorite Durbin movie, and I think it's largely to do with the unconvincing fashion in which Alice's infatuation is resolved, a side effect of which is that it puts Melvyn Douglas's character in a bad light in the eyes of Durbin's character. All in all, in spite of Durbin's vibrant presence and Douglas's wry wit, I'm more inclined to steer you towards THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER, a superior similarly-themed picture. Despite being co-scripted by Billy Wilder, THAT CERTAIN AGE lacks that sparkling touch so prominent in other Durbin films.

- THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP (1939)

I guess Ray Milland and John 'Dusty' King's characters - the two romantic leads in THREE SMART GIRLS - must've gotten their walking papers. THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP is the heartwarming middle child in a trilogy, after THREE SMART GIRLS (which was Durbin's star-making film debut) and followed in 1943 by HERS TO HOLD. The plot catches us up to the three Craig sisters a few years later, with the youngest sister Penny (Durbin) not having gotten shy and passive in the interim. This time she tries to sort out her sisters' romantic entanglements, what with Joan and Kay having fallen for the same guy. Most of the cast is back, with Helen Parrish subbing for Barbara Read as Kay. Robert Cummings, in his first of three co-starring roles with Durbin, steps in as a piano-playing charmer who just may be the solution that Penny's been looking for. I really like the ending to this one, as we get to see the final and well-done payoff to the hat and coat running gag, as well as Charles Winninger's absent-minded father taking charge and masterminding a happy ending for everyone at the wedding. Durbin sings ""Invitation to the Dance,"" ""La Capinera,"" ""The Last Rose of Summer, and the lovely ""Because"" (a song Deanna sang at her sister's wedding in 1936).

Bonus features: Robert Osborne's intro; Behind the Scenes photos; publicity & scene stills; movie posters; and a TCMDb article.

- BECAUSE OF HIM (1946)

Charles Laughton, who was so very good in IT STARTED WITH EVE, reunites with Durbin five years later and submits a much hammier (but still very fun) performance. He plays a distinguished stage actor who requires a promising young actress to play opposite him for his next play, titled Strange Laughter. Here comes Kim Walker (Durbin), waitress and aspiring actress, who somehow passes herself off as an experienced thespian and lands the coveted part, with Laughton in on the deception. Playwright Paul Taylor (Franchot Tone) - who authored Strange Laughter - is the film's fly in the ointment. He'd rather that a more seasoned actress assume the leading lady role. He doesn't hesitate to label Kim Walker a manipulative sort. With all this friction and bluster in the air, you just know someone's bound to fall in love.

Laughton's wickedly grandiose acting steals the film from Durbin, that is, until Durbin starts to sing. Disappointingly, she only sings three songs, but they're memorable: ""Danny Boy,"" Tosti's ""Goodbye,"" and ""Lover."" ""Lover"" happens to be one of my favorite Durbin renditions as she sings counterpoint to her own recording of the Rodgers and Hart classic. BECAUSE OF HIM is a less venomous precursor to ALL ABOUT EVE, except that Deanna Durbin never does lose her girl-next-door appeal. Putting aside the engaging dialogue and Laughton's ham and Durbin's opportunistic hijinks, I remember this movie most for Durbin's singing of ""Lover"" and ""Goodbye"" (this last song while she amusingly pursues Franchot Tone) and also for the bit concerning Durbin's clever use of the eminent stage actor's autograph. Note that this film also features Franchot Tone's third outing with Durbin (after NICE GIRL? and HIS BUTLER'S SISTER), and, honestly, how better to end this segment than with a Franchot Tone comment?

DVD's bonus stuff: Robert Osborne's intro; publicity & scene stills; movie posters; and a TCMDb article.

- FOR THE LOVE OF MARY (1948)

This is Durbin's 21st and final starring vehicle, after which, at the ripe old age of 27, she walked away from the movie industry and into quiet, married life in a French village. Efforts to pull her back into cinema would fail abjectly, and you have to respect her standing her ground. FOR THE LOVE OF MARY, a madcap romantic comedy, isn't a bad way to go out on. Durbin plays Mary Peppertree, a White House switchboard operator plagued by three suitors: an attorney (Jeffrey Lynn), a naval officer (Edmond O'Brien), and a fish peddler - okay, he's more of an ichthyologist (Don Taylor). One of the elements which makes this movie fun to watch is that you're never actually certain until the third act just with whom Mary will end up. Mary develops a case of the hiccups whenever she's emotionally stressed, and I suppose that's a clue. But everyone is all up in her business, what with four Supreme Court justices giving her unsolicited romantic advice. Even the President of the United States, disembodied voice that he is, gets into the act. There's some irony in a telephone operator so popular that she fields more personal calls than lines from outside parties. You'll groan but I'll say it anyway: There's something about Mary.

Deanna Durbin sings two songs (""Moonlight Bay"" and ""I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen"") with a barbershop quartet comprised of the four Supreme Court justices. On the classic side, she sings Johann Strauss' ""On the Wings of a Song"" and, for what would be her final musical performance on cinema, a comic rendition of ""Largo al Factotum"" from the opera Il Barbiere di Siviglia, after which she promptly trips and falls into a pond, exhibiting that refreshing lack of pretentiousness up to the very end.

My personal favorites of this set are Mad About Music, and For the Love of Mary.
