7926809,4,B00004Y6BP,"This was one of my favorite, obscure, movies from the 80s. The story is fantastic, based on Astrid Lindgren's (of Pipi Longstocking and Ronja, Robber's Daughter fame) book Mio, My Son.  For those complaining about the special effects, yeah, they are pretty cheesy, but given what they had to work with (20,000,000 Swedish Krone was worth $3 million in 1987-a pittance for a fantasy flick) and it was filmed mostly in Soviet Russia, Sweden, and a bit of Scotland, it isn't too bad. Unsure about the casting. The boy who played Mio has 1 film to his credit and this is it. He rather overacted it a bit. His trusty sidekick, Jum Jum (Yoom Yoom) was played by a very young Christian Bale, who at the time was an unknown-reports say that this movie is what caught Spielburg's eye when Bale was cast as Jim in Empire of the Sun. Timothy Bottoms as the King, and the indomitable Christopher Lee as the evil sorcerer Kato, round out the cast leads. The music is good. Performed by the Soviet Army Band, who was, perforce, an excellent group. And the haunting title song Mio, My Mio (Mio, Min Mio in Swedish and Mio, Moj Mio in Russian) was Written by Benny and Bjork of ABBA and performed by the Swedish group, Gemini.

Overall, there is more to like than not, if you can look past the campy effects, which most children can.",1506988800,,1317,4.483333333333333

7926811,2,B00004Y6BP,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was a kid, and immediately fell in love with the magic horse. I watched it over and over until my vhs tape wore out, and then grew up and forgot about it.

Recently though, I stumbled across a refernce that reminded me of the movie, and I decided to watch it again as an adult. It was then I had one of those moments where you re-visit a childhood memory and wonder, ""What the heck was I thinking back then?"".

The skeleton of the film is decent, though some of the special effects are pretty dated, the visuals are still beautiful in of themselves, believeable or not. The musical score is great, the plot engaging, and the cast is impressive.

So what the heck were they thinking when they cast the lead actor? Was he some producers kid? Was the director related to him in some way? He was beyond words, I've seen better acting in a school play! His preformance was terrible, possibly ruining the movie for me unless you count the moments where I had to laugh at his fake crying scenes, terrible lines, etc. And they cast Christian Bale as a co-star? WTF?

So to sum it up, the movie is fine if you don't need special effects or a likeable main character. I think it was great for my generation, but kids who grow up on movies like Finding Nemo and Toy Story might not be impressed.",1319241600,,1327,4.274900398406374
7926812,5,B00004Y6BP,I watched this movie as a young girl in Russia - when it first came out.  I was enthralled by it.  I had completely forgotten about it until I was searching Amazon for Astrid Lindgren books for my children (Karlson on the Roof was my favorite as a child).  I discovered that Ms. Lindgren had also written Mio my Mio (Mio in the Land of Far Away).  This is a truly wonderful film - I wish that it was more widely available for an affordable price.,1286323200,,446,4.151162790697675
7926813,5,B00004Y6BP,"I remember back in 2000 or 2001, I saw this air on Sci-Fi Channel, and loved it.  I'm very surprised that this is a hard and obscured movie on DVD, knowing it's got a great cast including young Christian Bale, Christopher Lee, Timothy Bottoms, and Susannah York.  I think that Mio and the Land of Faraway should be re-released onto DVD for those who have seen this and loved it, since at the time it was released onto DVD, it was when VHS was still the most used and affordable type of video for all video technology.

To all parents: Need another great sci-fi/fantasy movie to show to children of all ages?  This one is a recommendation.",1252368000,2,638,4.427350427350428
7926814,5,B00004Y6BP,"This movie (on VHS) was given to me many years ago as a gift. Although I had never even heard of this film at the time, it only took one viewing for it to become a favorite of mine. These days, it seems you can score a DVD of ""The Land of Faraway"" for a cool hundred bones. And I assure you, it is worth every penny.

First off, there's the drab opening scenes where poor orphan Bosse gets picked on by everyone. You'll feel sorry for him, but that's because you don't realize he has a wondrous destiny in store. All of a sudden, a giant floating head materializes out of nowhere and, ordering Bosse to hang onto his beard, spirits him away to the Land of Faraway! Needless to say, this is a bizarre montage that will astound you.

The floating head delivers him to the palace, where he meets his father (the King, natch) and his best friend Jum-Jum. (How you can have a best friend you've never met is a bit bewildering to me, but hey, it's Christian Bale, and he could sell a blind man a ""pap"", let alone a friendless loser on the prospect of a new homie.) Bosse gets a new name, ""Mio"", and a flying horse, ""Miramis"", and the audience begins to wonder what the heck is going on here.

Enter the evil villain, KATO! Every time his name is spoken, a fierce and scary wind blows from somewhere offscreen. The effect is so comical, I guarantee you will find yourself repeatedly faux-intoning ""KA-TO!!"" after watching the film. (By the way, it rhymes with ""gato"", not NATO.) Christopher Lee is awesome in this role, particularly when he gets to deliver lines like ""This is the most dangerous sword I've had in my castle...it cannot kill the young and innocent!"" Obviously, the new Prince of Faraway needs to take this mug down. So Mio and Jum-Jum set out on an adventure to take down KATO and restore peace to the Land of Faraway.

Cue the ABBA-penned theme!

If you're looking for a wondrous fantasy film that will thrill child and grownup alike, you might fare better with Harry Potter, etc. But if you're in the mood for a freaky Swedish flick that looks like it was made under the heavy influence of mushrooms, with a really scary wind that blows every time someone says ""KATO"", this movie is for you!",1146441600,22,2202,4.400491400491401
7926815,5,B00004Y6BP,"This is a magical and very loved english talking-movie played out in sweden but with many english actors and some swedish.

Astrid Lindgren - author of the book

Christopher Lee - actor who plays Saruman in (lord of the rings)

Christian Bale - Actor who played Jim in (Empire of the sun)

people who doesn't speak swedish don't know how many great child movies we have (written by Astrid Lindgren) that are extremly wonderful and magical.

other favorits are:

Ronja (Ronia, the Robber's Daughter)

Broderna lejonhjarta (The Brothers Lionheart)

And many others... for people who enjoys foreign cool movies.",1123286400,5,608,5.070707070707071
7926816,3,B00004Y6BP,"...with sometimes sadly poor effects, but besides that it still manages to be convinsing as an epic adventure, and the heartfelt and inspiring story of the great Astrid Lindgren never fails. It's the kind of movie that makes children dream, and an adventure they will never quite forget when they grow up. I was a child the first time I saw it, and I saw it the first time since I was about ten years old today (now I'm 27). It was a lot of fun to see the scenes that I only vaguely  remembered from the theatre those many years ago, and though (as mentioned) the effects are now a bit ""outdated"" it could have been a lot worse -just keep in mind that this was made long before ""Harry Potter"". And it's a classic tale of a battle beteen good and evil, nothing complex, and not surprisingly it reminds a lot of ""Lionheart"" of the same author. Enjoy!",1120003200,6,848,4.3
