Don't imagine this is high art.  It isn't.  This is trash.  It's a very bad movie.  But funny!

I especially liked the unconscious montage of anal raping.  Those were just the kinds of dreams that I imagine every coma victim has while being anally raped.

I recommend it.  Just don't expect anything good.",1399334400,,437,4.35

I watched this in the back seat of the family van, while going to a 4th of July party, and I thought it was incredibly hilarious! I should have watched Norwegian comedy a long time ago. The film spoofs Kill Bill. A man named Jompa Torman is reluctantly about to be married until Tampa Buljo, Crazy Beibifeit, Dr. Kjell Driver, and Bud Light kill all of his family and try to kill him. After he wakes up from his coma, he is a man with nothing to lose and takes the law into his own hands. Hot on his trail is a dumb and mean-spirited cop named Sid Wislff and his partner, Unni Formen. Sid wants Jompa behind bars, but Unni begins to realize that he is innocent. I literally laughed until I cried! I highly recommend KILL BULJO!!!

p.s. HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!",1246665600,6,821,4.229299363057325
8307867,1,B001H5X6SA,"I am not up on my Norwegian humor but I am hoping this is not the mainstream over there.

Dimension seems to be going this way of late, not sure why though. This one follows the plot of Kill Bill, except all guy on guy humor, guy on animal humor and gross out unfunny humor. I am sure I missed all of the ""Laplander"" inside jokes, but the constant gay sex, animal sex, urination humor, even a Deliverance homage, all fell flat.

The picture quality looks great, especially with all the beautiful countryside they filmed in, but the sound was a mess. No special features but you do have the option of the native language or English dub (was a bad dub). I think the joke might be on Amazon as the clip they have here was translated much differently in the film - that last clip he says something much different.
