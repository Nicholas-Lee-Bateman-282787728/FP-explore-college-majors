8335151,5,B001Q8DMCI,"A Stellar performance by yet another beautiful brazilian woman. Wow, I think Brazil has the most beauiful women in the world!!! Paula's voice is outstanding, the music is top-notch, what's there not to like?  This is a DVD I will watch many many times, it's THAT good. The production values of this DVD are high, one of the best I've seen. I can not imagine ANYONE not liking this DVD!!!! If you like music from Brazil then you MUST give it a try. It is Hot Hot Hot and so is the beauty of Paula Lima.",1276041600,,501,4.21875

I originally obtained the CD direct from Brazil, and was so blown away that I had to have this DVD as well.  Thanks ""AllMediaFun"" for making the effort to stock this, it really should be more available!

Paula Lima is one of the new generation of Brazilian performers who manage to combine US soul and funk influences with samba & MPB, without compromising either style. It's a mystery to me why she isn't a major international star - with music like this the language barrier is irrelevant.  Check out her awesome version of Jorge Ben's ""Jorge de Capadocia"", and her definitive performance of Seu Jorge's ""Quero Ver Voce no Baile"".  Forget your production-line US and British soul divas - Paula Lima is the real thing!",1239753600,3,802,4.626760563380282
