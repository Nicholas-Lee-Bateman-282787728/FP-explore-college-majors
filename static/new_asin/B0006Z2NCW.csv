2197227,2,B0006Z2NCW,"I bought this movie to catch up on Gregoire Colin's antics - to see how he'd graduated from Olivier Olivier and Beau Travail for example. Although there was nothing wrong with his performance, I felt that the script was so lamentable and so laboured that there was no way I would recommend this jejeune movie to anyone without jeopardising the friendship. It is just wet!  Praise the Lord it is available at a Loss Leader price, otherwise I would be liable to self flagellate with a plastic appendage. Catherine, what were you thinking?",1284249600,,536,4.763440860215054
2197228,5,B0006Z2NCW,"At some level, every film by Catherine Breillat is about dominant/submissive dynamics in the relations between men and women. In Sex Is Comedy, we get to see these power plays in theme-and-variations, the dominant role reversing and reversing again, sometimes line-by-line. All but a few scenes are between one man and one woman. It is also a brilliant behind-the-scenes look at filming an act of lovemaking, and the absurd amount of effort it takes to film a spontaneous-looking scene. Think of Truffaut's Day for Night plus a prosthetic penis.

Consider these moments: the male star refuses to take off his socks for the love scene; Jeanne, the female director, gets drunk and mischievously confesses her methods of manipulating actors to the A.D.; the co-star ""lovers"" can't stand each other--their initial attempts at kissing are described by the director as looking ""like a corpse""; waiting for the lighting crew, the male lead paces nervously, his prosthetic erection bobbing up and down, exposed through the slit in his bathrobe. Sound like situation comedy? Well, it is and it isn't. It sets up the situations for comedy, then plays them for drama. This is what makes this often frustrating director one of the greatest living artists of the motion picture.

If you laugh, it is the laughter to relieve dramatic tension. The only scenes truly played for laughs are the attempts to film lovemaking in the movie-within-the-movie. And they are utterly hilarious. Along the way, serious questions are posed, if not answered. Does getting an actor to show an intimate part of himself take away part of his soul? Is the director of such scenes any better than a sort of voyeuristic Caligula, orchestrating something indecent for his or her pleasure?

And what about those few scenes where members of the same sex play off each other? In Sex Is Comedy, all the scenes of women with women are conspiratorial, and all the scenes of men with men show them as purveyors of vulgarity. If Brief Crossing didn't already show us that Breillat does not even pretend to be impartial, look at the final shot of Sex Is Comedy: a two-shot of director and actress locked in tearful embrace. I, personally, don't mind the bias, because it is in the foreground. No matter how I may disagree with Breillat's characterizations, there is never any attempt to cloak them as anything other than what they are. I completely respect that.",1280102400,4,2416,4.945812807881773
2197229,5,B0006Z2NCW,Catherine Breillat logra una excelente pelicula en la que todo transcurre alrededor de la grabacion de una sola escena y explora las emociones y sentimientos del grupo con un final brillante,1277337600,,190,5.161290322580645
2197230,5,B0006Z2NCW,"The movie shows a fair amount of skin, but that isn't really the point - it is the movie within a movie, and the director being driven nuts by her male lead who is ambivalent about doing the nude scene about which the whole film revolves  Anne Parillaud was My Femme Nikita; Catherine Breillat has directed several such films (I think this might have been somewhat more than a little autobiographical - the film within the film resembles ""Fat Girl""",1220572800,,448,4.6
2197231,5,B0006Z2NCW,"Catherine Breillat is one of the greatest filmmakers working today.  Her films are extraordinarily accurate in their depiction of the war between the sexes.  Too often people are terrified of her work (both the public and the critics), because it's so truthful.  This film is a companion piece to her masterpiece Fat Girl, in that it is a depiction of the making of the scene where the older sister ends up having sex with a local suitor.  It is not a comedy, it is a Catherine Brelliat film.  Many people rent this film thinking it's going to be fun.  It's a great film, and it's not frivilous.  If you admire Breillat (which you should), you should rent this.  If you hate her, stay away, and it's your loss...",1177718400,6,712,4.5078125
2197232,1,B0006Z2NCW,"Well, I don't know if sex is comedy, I admit it does seem a grand cosmic absurd idea at times, but making a film about filming sex is stupid. It was pretty boring most of the time. The only interesting character was the male lead actor. He was such a pompous, vain, childish pain to work with. I wonder how many male acting stars are like him? I'm guessing too many. And I doubt if women are any better. If it wasn't for him, the film would have been a complete disaster. I refuse to recommend this to anyone except to people that are into self-torture. It's that bad.",1154995200,3,568,4.220183486238532
2197233,1,B0006Z2NCW,"Viewing this tenuous, torpid, tedious and talky film was like living one of those nightmares where one runs and runs and gets nowhere. Perhaps the dullest movie ever made supposedly involving sex.

Or maybe involving anything. Certainly the very least-engaging, unenjoyable movie I've ever seen. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",1154390400,2,312,5.782608695652174
2197234,2,B0006Z2NCW,"Intellectualization of a pornography in the name of love and sex and then wrap it up as a comedy. To me, this film is neither funny nor imaginative.",1143244800,5,148,4.321428571428571
2197235,3,B0006Z2NCW,"As one who loves films that appeal to intellectual sorties as well as those that simply tell stories, this film should have been appealing.  But as written and directed by Catherine Breillat who seems to be playing out her own conundrums in filmmaking experiences, this tedious and talky film fails to arouse interest.

The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is the screen form of Breillat, a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr&eacute;goire Colin is The Actor and Roxane Mesquida is The Actress).  The one 'comic' bit is Jeanne's imposing the use of a dildo strapped onto the Actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to fruition, but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a 'Deleted Scenes' featurette on a DVD than a solid French comedy with class.

2197236,4,B0006Z2NCW,"I actually enjoyed this movie. I did not find it boring or dull. I think viewers who approach this expecting another typical Breillat film (provocative, shocking) will indeed find it tedious. It is different from her other films. It doesn't have their sexual/moral agenda. Neither is it a comedy. It is almost documentary-like. I had the impression that I was watching a ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette that could have been appended to any one of her other films. The whole movie revolves around a director (obviously Breillat herself) who has trouble trying to set up a crucial sex scene in her movie because her two stars detest each other. For much of the movie, we watch her plead, cajole and threaten, her actors into giving her the performance she wants.

This is more a movie about the mechanics of making a film, specifically of shooting a sex scene and the difficult relationship between director and actor.

There isn't much nudity or actual sex in this film (well, at least compared to her other movies), although we do get to see Roxane Mesquida (the pretty sister in Fat Girl) full frontal and Gregoire Colin complete with rampant prosthetic. I can understand why it is derided, especially by fans of Breillat, but you can't expect a director to always provoke or shock. How boring would that be. Here we see her reflecting on the craft of film-making. If you have some interest in film-making or at least how Breillat herself shoots her films, this would be enlightening.

MGM's transfer is in the original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (anamorphic). The source print is clean. Colors are natural. Contrast and sharpness are fine. There is fine film grain throughout although this isn't distracting. Thankfully the English subtitles are optional.",1113091200,27,1763,4.949324324324325

8043866,4,B0006Z2NCW,"""SiC"" is an Art House Comedy; mildly flamboyant, artsy, sophisticated and latently humorous film. Lots of European Cinema has a 1960ish grittiness to it, unlike the more sharply focused and HiDef films of Hollywood. Many of the stories radiate with an aura of 'Real Life', even when depicting Fiction.

Whether or not the portrayals bare any resemblence to the actual atmosphere(s), and overall shenanigans of a professional Film Set, or Movie Studio is questionable at best, though not taken too seriously, ""SEX is COMEDY"" does allow the curiosity of imagination to escape which, really provides the fuel to follow it to the last frame. No grotesque nudity, just enough to tell the story without being memorable. Probably a good 90 minutes for anyone interested in studying the Art of Cinematography...  ---GBJ",1313107200,,811,5.183206106870229
