8654969,3,B00K0S34PK,"The James Storm-Mr. Anderson match was perfectly fine, but nothing special. The Samoa Joe-Jeff Hardy match was not great but pretty good. The Austin Aries-Kurt Angle match while good, they were holding due to the format. The James Storm-Bully Ray match was fine at best. The Bobby Roode-Sting match was not good but at least it was short. The Samoa Joe-Austin Aries match was good but could have gone longer. The Bobby-Roode-James Storm match while not as good as their past bouts, it was still solid in it's own right. The Bobby Roode-Samoa Joe match was also not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1422835200,,618,4.576576576576577
8654970,1,B00K0S34PK,"I'm enjoying the ""One Night Only"" series and finding them very enjoyable . . . however this show is not.

I looked at the card and was so excited to see some of these match-ups. Samoa Joe vs. Austin Aries, Kurt Angle vs. Austin Aries, Samoa Joe vs. Jeff Hardy, Bobby Roode vs. Sting. All these matches seem like great match-ups and some of these matches have been great ppv main events in the past. Unfortunately none of these matches are very good. Nearly all of the matches feel very phoned in and cheap and meandered over what could've be great matches. I watched it through twice and both times I was disappointed. But just forget this one.",1404432000,,644,4.4576271186440675
8654971,3,B00K0S34PK,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme.  This edition is based around a tournament featuring former TNA World Heavyweight Champions. It should also be noted that history packages & highlights of championship victories shown on every competitor was shown throughout the show.

James Storm vs. Mr. Anderson - This was a wild card match where the winner would get the last open spot in the tournament as both men started off with exchanges including trading fist as they traded momentum with Anderson attempting to take shortcuts before eventually getting caught.  This was a solid encounter.

Jeff Hardy vs. Samoa Joe - Jeff Hardy started out fast paced with his offense of a flying clothesline & head scissors takeover but Joe slowed down the pace with his dominate attack of strikes & using his weight to his advantage such as a running back splash in the corner along with keeping grounded but clearly showing signs of frustration because Hardy kept kicking out of his pin attempts as they did trade momentum throughout the match coming down to where one had to catch the other.  A good match with two men having completely different wrestling styles.

Kurt Angle vs. Austin Aries - This was their first ever meeting against each other with Angle coming in with his knee taped up as Aries attempted to get the mental edge by outwrestling Angle including going in the down amateur wrestling position only for Angle to be heavily amused & even laughing at one point causing Aries to use other tactics to get the advantage working over Angle but continued to mock Angle only for both men to trade submissions to the point where both men were favoring their legs.  This was a solid good first meeting between both men as far as wrestling & including some entertaining comedy as well.

James Storm vs. Bully Ray - Bully attacked Storm from behind using both his power advantage with a bearhug along with dirty tactics such as pulling Storm's hair while being able to stop Storm dead in his tracks whenever he was starting to build momentum before Storm was able to start a come back causing Bully to resort to another tactic.  The match itself wasn't much but was more about the story of Storm being beaten & weakened even more than he already was with Bully feeling like he had nothing to lose or prove.

Sting vs. Bobby Roode - Roode started out with his offense having no effect on Sting before they traded momentum with both men taking advantage of mistiming by the other man as Roode was able to keep avoiding the scorpion deathlock & attempted to mock Sting only for Sting to keep taking advantage of mistakes by Roode only for Roode to catch a break & heavily working over the arm of Sting.  This match wasn't much past Sting's usual work but did tell a good story in regards to Roode's attitude constantly coming back to haunt him & working over the arm.

Samoa Joe vs. Austin Aries - It should be noted that this is the second time in these ""One Night Only"" series that these two faced off against each other with Aries attempting many times to move Joe to no avail that Joe was amused & Aries got so frustrated that he almost got counted out walking away before Joe worked over Aries with a set of drop toeholds & strikes only for Aries to repeat the same series of offense & mock Joe in the process resulting in Joe responding with aggression such as bouncing his head off the steps as both men traded momentum throughout the contest.  This was a good contest telling the story of Aries attempting to use the same strategy he had with Angle against Joe.

James Storm vs. Bobby Roode - Storm came into the match favoring his arm after being attacked by Bully Ray with Roode taunting & targeting it right away with Storm responding with brawling in & out of the ring including using the guardrail & a bottle over Roode's head only for Roode to throw Storm into the steps shoulder first & beating on that bad arm only for Storm to still bring the fight with one arm causing Roode to resort to other tactics.  These two have natural chemistry & this was no exception playing off the injury very well throughout the match.

Samoa Joe vs. Bobby Roode - Joe was very dominate in the beginning with his own series of offense with Roode's attempts to break it by either going to the outside or counter with his own offense such as a headbutt that knocked himself down having no effect resorting in Roode using dirty tactics to get an advantage with both men going back & forth trading series of counters & submission attempts.  This was a competitive match between both men.

This was probably the most star studded edition of the ""One Night Only"" series so far but the quality of this event itself came off more like a star studded edition of Impact as the action on here was solid & not a bad match on here but nothing was outstanding or very memorable & they wasted too much time on the video packages with some showing the same highlights more than once.  In the end, it's still an event I would check out.",1398902400,3,5180,4.544575725026853
