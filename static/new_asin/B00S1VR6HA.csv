8696951,5,B00S1VR6HA,"Since we have received this my 5 year old has not stopped watching it! He watches it for hours and loves all the different cartoons. The best part is when he finds something really funny and tries to tell you what is happening. He gets so dramatic. Plus if you sit down to watch it with him, he wants to tell you what the next cartoon is about and what happens.
My husband and son have watched this so much they even know the title to the cartoons. (Yes we need a life.)
Their favorite cartoon in this set is Betty Boop.
My son went to school telling everyone about Betty Boop and the only one who knew what he was talking about was the teacher. Yes we are providing great culture to our child.
So for us this is a great purchase. Something we watch as a family and something a 5 year old will love!",1487289600,2,799,4.095541401273885
