8132518,4,B000GI3KTO,"Stunning footage of seminal events in the history of the Third Reich in the 1930s.

Set the disc to German language with English subtitles. If you have had a year or two of German, you will benefit from hearing the original sound track.

All my life I have heard about Goebbel's propaganda. Now we see it in the original. Berlin Olympics, the first one, 1936: Women swimmers, Americans first place, second place, third place, and there is the flag, and the anthem, all USA: Not seeing the Nazi angle here ... what am I missing ... Jesse Owens, Black USA entrant, wins the long jump ... Lutz Long is second ... great footage of Owens ... where did I miss the propaganda ??? Ballroom dancing. British win top spots, reported with respect and enthusiasm for the British winners. How is this Nazi propaganda?  Judge it for yourself.",1368576000,,828,4.619047619047619
8132519,5,B000GI3KTO,"Yes, it is Nazi propaganda, but it is real.  Very interesting film from an historic viewpoint.  One can readily see how the German people were fooled by the Nazis.  If you were not a Jew, and you kept your thoughts to yourself, and you did what you were told, things were great, until the war started.",1334534400,,301,4.339285714285714
8132520,4,B000GI3KTO,"Like most documentaries covering the 12 years of the Third Reich, this series has one significant shortcoming -- the English subtitles. The translations rendered are often inaccurate, amusing or downright stupid. The English-language versions feature a narrator obviously at pains to imitate the misunderstood style of the German original, but he would better qualify for parts in some comedies intended to ridicule (""The Producers""). When are these ""experts"" going to learn the difference between National Socialists and Nazis? No one in the Reich would have identified himself or the system as Nazi. This entire program should be available in one single or two DVD's.",1315526400,,669,5.4423076923076925
8132521,4,B000GI3KTO,"To begin with, a caveat emptor for this and every other title in this series (save the first episode, which you should avoid if possible)---if you dislike having to read subtitles while you listen to a German-language soundtrack, don't bother buying this. The English-language soundtrack consists of a British narrator reading the subtitles and trying to sound like he thinks an English-speaking Propaganda Ministry announcer would sound; it's really bad and gets old after a minute. Sir Laurence Olivier this guy is not! You're much better off reading the subtitles and listening to it auf Deutsch, even if you don't understand German.  As has been pointed out elsewhere though, the subtitles are sometimes wildly off-base (you would think the makers of this series would've spent the money to get a professional translation done), so care needs to be taken with what you read as well.  Furthermore, the Germans made good use of sound in their newsreel footage---if they didn't have weapons firing, machines humming or boots marching there's a lot of music filling the sound between the German narration. If you listen to the English soundtrack to this episode, all of the sound is mixed down and the English narration laid atop it and the effect is completely lost.

Also, Part One of every episode except the first is a five-minute history of Hitler and the rise of the Nazis using a lot of still shots; there's nothing in it you don't already know if you're not a novice on twentieth-century Germany.

This episode features varied topics depicting the prewar Third Reich. It even includes color footage (the only in this series) that was made of life in Berlin as an enticement to prospective foreign visitors for the 1936 Olympics. There's a lot of coverage of the Olympics, including the opening ceremonies, high-diving and track and field. The Party Rally in Nuremberg in '36 is shown, as is coverage of Mussolini's visit to Germany the following year.  The Anschluss of Austria in '38 is covered, and there's some footage of the mammoth military parade for Hitler's 50th birthday in April 1939. The episode takes a darker turn when it depicts the Polish Army, and then the war begins, with Hitler announcing the opening of the war to the Reichstag and combat footage of the Polish campaign is included, culminating in the fall of Warsaw.

The film footage varies in quality, with that of the Rhineland reoccupation in 1936 looking decidedly second-generation and the color footage from the next year of very good quality. None of it is of HD quality, however.  If you've seen the first two episodes of the BBC's World At War you'll recognize much of the latter part of this episode---unfortunately, the footage on this disc doesn't have the clarity and quality the BBC included in their program. Still, it's a worthwhile episode to have and recommended to anyone interested.",1304208000,,2882,4.954451345755694

8132524,5,B000GI3KTO,"As a amateur World War II history buff, I found this view of Hitler and the Nazi Parties approach to is public to be interesting and informative.  Although there is material seen previously, I find that I learn more each time I see these types of films.",1186185600,4,253,4.382978723404255
