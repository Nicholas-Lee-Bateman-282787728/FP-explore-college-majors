8399237,4,B003L16F5Y,"This is a solid introduction to the extraordinary and complex art created by Edouard Manet.  The narrative is flat but informative. Excellent use is made of archival material as well as film created at locations where Manet painted.  A 3 disc set on ""Impressionism"" contains (disc 2) a far more lively and interesting treatment of Manet but the disc reviewed here offers additional materials.",1454025600,,392,5.109375
8399238,5,B003L16F5Y,"Manet, what more need to be said.  An excellent documentary detailing the life of the GrandFather of Impressionism.",1426723200,3,115,5.388888888888889
8399239,5,B003L16F5Y,"If you love the work of Manet as much as I do (or, really, even if you've never heard of him), this is a fabuous documentary. You also get to see the France that he saw.  If you liked ""Midnight in Paris,"" you'll love this.",1371600000,4,222,3.933333333333333
8399240,5,B003L16F5Y,"This fine documentary evokes 19th century Paris as a backdrop to its exploration of Manet and his rebellion against the preceding neo-classical style.  It shows how Manet, while not an Impressionist himself, paved the way for that movement.  Excellent narration.  (The same film was previously issued under the name ""Les Silences de Manet"".)",1371254400,5,341,5.39622641509434
