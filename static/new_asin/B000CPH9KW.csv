So if you think you get to watch the British romantic thriller, think again, at least until the DVD arrives.",1326844800,2,271,5.022222222222222
2468217,5,B000CPH9KW,"As a 20 year or more fan of Michael Kitchen, I was surprised and delighted to see him acting in such an uncharacteristic role. His quiet portrayal of a charming fellow a bit down on his luck, turns out to be that of an evil man without a conscience. Without stepping too far out of his acting style, Kitchen's character was very real and chilling. As usual, he takes his time developing the character with small expressions and mannerisms, but for all the charm his character displays, you know something is not quite right and the twist, though somewhat expected, ends on a note that I didn't expect, which made this movie all the more creepy, but enjoyable.",1278028800,9,659,4.593220338983051
2468218,5,B000CPH9KW,"No, it's not the old pop ballad.  Here, we're falling into the abyss.  The Andrew Davies script and Michael Kitchen performance are worth the price of admission.  Kitchen plays the innocuously named Henry Kent, a local Yorkshireman living on a canal boat.  When a London novelist (the wonderful Penelope Wilton) arrives at her recently-purchased cottage, fresh from a failed marriage and ready to go to work, Henry appears.  He offers his gardening services, then volunteers to take care of the cottage in her absence, then volunteers to help warm her bed.  He tells her stories of lost loves and his victimization at the hands of the class system.  Slowly it dawns on her that he is not quite what he appears to be.  Her agent and a gay male friend both scope him out as bad news from the get-go.  It takes the novelist longer, since he has expressed his love for her and exhibited his sexual prowess on cold, damp Yorkshire nights.  After they argue and he strikes her she sets off on an investigation of his past and learns what has really happened.  He is an opportunist who exploits wealthy women . . . or worse.

This is a small film, but not a claustrophobic one.  Many of us think of Michael Kitchen as the benevolent Christopher Foyle, but he has long played villain roles.  He plays them expertly.  Falling is creepy and laced with tension but it is not full-tilt gothic with blood splattering across the walls.  It is plausible, domestic gothic, with good direction, an excellent script and superb performances.  Also some brief nudity and adult language.  Watch this before you hire any volunteers to fix up your garden.",1276214400,20,1632,4.706713780918728
2468219,3,B000CPH9KW,"Different sort of role for Kitchen, unexpected.  Has moments of high drama but somewhat contrived.",1275177600,,98,5.533333333333333
2468220,4,B000CPH9KW,"Older women like me, pursued by acquisitive poor men, will really enjoy this film.  First of all, it's sadly amusing to the inth degree.  Here we have a sensitive, pretty but fading, highly intelligent, well educated and well read older woman who's lost two husbands and and is lonely.  Along comes an attractive, viable man about her own age.  Who wouldn't perk up for that?  But what she gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for.  You've got to see it.",1232323200,15,461,4.493975903614458
2468221,5,B000CPH9KW,"The story is based on fact and because the storyteller allows the viewer to know each of the main characters motivations and feelings as or before events happen, it's all the more menacing.  Michael Kitchen is such a good actor but in this movie he is not kindly old Mr. Foyle. He really is a dispicable and menacing character.  In parts I was really frightened for Penelope Wilton's charactor.  Of course, in the end she pulls it together in a way that makes any women's libber proud.  Its a good story, well told, well photographed.  Well worth the money and time.",1208908800,32,566,4.564356435643564
2468222,5,B000CPH9KW,"""Falling."" What a wonderful title! After seeing this film, ""falling"" brings to mind stepping up to the brink, closing your eyes, and taking a plunge--without ever looking.

 For fans of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, (played by Michael Kitchen in ""Foyle's War""), this movie is a superb opportunity to see a lot more of the actor (without so many other characters murdering each other and taking precious screen time away from Kitchen, as they do in ""Foyle's War""). In ""Falling"", Kitchen plays Henry Kent in a role that allows him to portray a much wider range of emotions than the character Christopher Foyle calls for--and to use a much broader vocabulary: I have a difficult time imaging the reticent Foyle voluntarily using the word ""ravish."" Henry Kent, on the other hand, proffers the word easily, guilefully.

 As the film begins, Henry, seated on a train, gives us an unusual soliloquy on love and loss. The oddity of this scene is alleviated somewhat as we then watch the glib, wonderfully friendly Henry meet his prospective love, Daisy (played by Penelope Wilton with just the right touch of bewilderment). Henry charms his way into her house and soon manages to light a fire for her, as it were. But, don't expect a simple romantic story here. Time spent with Henry could never be simple or straightforward. This tale moves forward to include a full range of emotions, including some heart-pounding suspense.

 Michael Kitchen gives a versatile and clever performance in which Henry Kent exudes a singular jaded charm--which seems conjured quite naturally by the actor. Kitchen's mature, handsome face and his boyish smile are a wonderful foil to the character's personality and intentions. This film is a little diamond, a gem which keeps turning, and in each turn, you see all the varying faces that Kitchen can reveal. Henry is tender, creepy, mercurial, tempting: he is a tribute to the wizardry of Michael Kitchen. Truly a tour-de-force performance.",1191888000,109,1984,5.070552147239264
2468233,3,B000CPH9KW,"this movie was okay, but only because it had Michael Kitchen in it.  I'm always disappointed whenever he plays someone other than Foyle because he made Foyle his and his alone.  Not so great for an acting career probably, but he is definitely an outstanding actor who imerges himself in his roles.  I really do enjoy watching Kitchen in whatever he is in.",1401753600,,355,4.603174603174603

2468237,5,B000CPH9KW,"I love anything with Michael Kitchen, but I was very reluctant to purchase and watch this DVD as his character was not a nice person. But I had to see it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was one of Michael's ""bad guy"" portrayals, (that he does so well) but his characterization of Henry Kent was so absolutely charming for most of the movie, that I have watched it several times since. It is absolutely a must see movie!",1380931200,4,433,4.425
2468238,5,B000CPH9KW,"This is a very different Michael Kitchen from his Foyle's War character.  This time he is the villain and plays the part with chilling authenticity proving his value as one of England's top actors.  The story is so interesting and his co-star, Penelope Wilton of Downton Abby fame, is also wonderful in the part of the duped lady.  Great movie.",1378425600,,344,4.7
2468239,5,B000CPH9KW,"... bit of a thriller ... odd love story (well, at least from one side of the couple) ... acting is 'understated' ... let's your imagination run ... at times seems predictable ... watch out.

Michael Kitchen is superb - quite the gentleman, with a seething cauldron underneath.  Edgy, a little Hitchcock-ish, but more sinister! Closing scene gave me shivers!",1369526400,3,358,4.95
