174569,5,0983789274,"I own a boarding & day care center for dogs and work in rescue with fox terriers. We do a lot of rehab work with our rescues and Dr. Yin's training methods are very helpful. When I heard about the workshop for reactive dogs I was thrilled - terriers are a reactive group :-)
A large portion of this video is taken up in training technique to the owners without dogs present. This is an important part that is often overlooked in other training videos - Dr Yin teaches you EXACTLY how to do it.
Another great aspect of the DVD is that it shows ""real"" dogs rather than those that have been rehearsed to death - these dogs make mistakes and we see how to address it.
I can't wait for Part 2!",1391040000,3,688,4.141791044776119
174570,4,0983789274,"I particularly liked what I 1st thought was a strange thing to find in a dog-training video - exercises.  I then realized that this is a good idea, and I did the exercises along with the video, like a work-out video.  My form definitely improved, and I felt more confident.  I found dogs focusing on me more.  Keeping correct body position while dog-training is really tough for me; a constant battle.  Sophia's techniques and method of getting them across is great!",1390953600,12,466,4.703703703703703
174571,5,0983789274,"From the moment I stumbled across Dr. Yin's website I loved her methods as well as her ability to demonstrate and teach the handler the skills to train their dog. This DVD goes beyond what you can watch for free on her website, showing various dogs and their handlers working through some basic (but EXTREMELY useful and foundational) focusing exercises. I wish it wasn't late at night right now because I want to head right out and start practicing!

I can't wait for part 2 to come out and I'll be buying it for sure!",1390435200,3,519,4.463157894736842
174572,5,0983789274,"I loved this DVD demonstrating Sophia Yin's techniques for handling a reactive dog.

We learned the techniques a couple of years before the DVD came out, through one-on-one consults and Sophia's classes, and have used them constantly since then. Every day, every moment away from home at first as we helped our dog learn that the world did not have to be a scary place for him and less often as his confidence grew. But five years later, we still use them whenever we encounter stressful situations such as a lunging aggressive leashed dog encountered on a walk. Thanks to Sophia's training, our dog rarely reacts to things these days, but it is still nice to have ways to manage his behavior and sense of security when something does worry him.

The DVD would have been great to have when we were learning. It not only explains and teaches the techniques but fills in around the edges of the techniques - why the technique is used, how it works to calm and focus a reactive dog. And the fine points of the technique that can seem trivial to someone new to training but, as the DVD demonstrates, are actually critical. With really practical and easy to understand demonstrations of why the fine points of the techniques - speed of movement, how ""big"" a gesture is, how our body language is or isn't understood by a dog, the information a dog gets from subtle points of body language - make so much difference.

It's also great to watch workshop members and their dogs, not only for what we and our dog had in common with them but for the challenges and dogs' behaviors that were different from ours and how Sophia approached individual behavior.

That was a concern I had in the beginning when exploring potential trainers. I had some trainers respond to three sentences of information with ""Oh, that dog just needs...."" It was important to me that whoever worked with our dog approached him as an individual with a  unique set of fears, triggers, and responses and Sophia came to his training with that approach. This DVD workshop does the same. The training isn't a rote exercise to be memorized. It is a skill to learn that is then adaptable to your dog's particular issues.

Learning Sophia's techniques for managing your reactive dog opens up the world to your dog. Where once we could hardly walk our dog through the neighborhood, we now take him on walks to many far more challenging places, including the home improvement store on weekdays when there is room for us to use Sophia's techniques if something worries him (like scary talking Halloween decorations!).

Even if you take classes or do consults with a behaviorist (and with a really challenging dog I think both are incredibly valuable), this DVD is valuable to help give you a really solid understanding of both how and why and lets you review the challenging parts of the skill of training and handling a reactive dog. I know from experience that it can be difficult in a consult or class setting to take everything in and I would have loved to have had this DVD to review as we worked through the training. It was good for me to view it now as a refresher to keep my skills as sharp as possible.

I also like that it very gently and compassionately reminds us that we need training as much as our fearful dogs, that much of what humans do in interacting with dogs is kind of bizarre - we would never do it to a person - and actually is communicating something very different from what we intend. It's really eye-opening to see the change in dogs when you communicate clearly to them and reward what you want.

Before working with our dog, I hadn't ever given much thought to how a dog would view human behavior and I didn't really know what a fearful dog looked like unless it was extreme. After Sophia's training, I realized there are a lot of scared dogs out there... There are useful little nuggets throughout the DVD on interpreting a dog's body language and behavior also.

So the DVD provides a wonderful opportunity to learn the techniques without attending a class or to reinforce and support what you learn in a class or consult. And it's fun to watch! I think I would have learned a lot faster if I'd had this DVD.",1390435200,17,4194,4.565159574468085
174573,3,0983789274,"I enjoyed the presentation and learnt a lot. I'm glad I bought the DVD. This Part 1 teaches how to get your dog to focus on you. In short, it deals very well with all the aspects mentioned in the write-up under ""editorial review"" - except ""addressing your dog's reactivity."" Perhaps this is covered in Part 2 of the presentation, but not in part 1.

What Dr Yin demonstrates (and very well) are the first steps of dog ownership, whether or not your dog is reactive.

Keeping your dog's focus on you is an important first step in dog handling in general, so the claim in the title of the DVD about reactive dogs in particular, is a bit misleading. That a dog won't react to another dog if it can't see another dog is so self-evident that ending the DVD on that note is really irritating.

If only Dr Yin would at least mention at the end of the DVD what the next steps are - to be covered in Part 2. Then I would buy part 2.

Two years ago I got an extremely hyperactive and reactive adult terrier from a neighbour who no longer wanted her. I walked her on the mountain and, although dogs supposedly cannot experience emotions, I felt she expressed overwhelming gratitude - in her over-exuberant way (her previous owners never walked her, not even around the block). I spend evenings teaching her tricks (as demonstrated on Youtube) and this interaction earned me even more gratitude. She loves showing off how clever she is; she loves the one-on-one interaction with me.

In the streets, these days, she may, more often than not, look at me instead of reacting to a bike or skateboard if I can capture her attention in time, which is evidently not always possible. A few days ago, she has already started to run after a noisy motorbike, when I said ""ah-ah"" and she sat down and looked at me foolishly. I was really surprised, but it's progress - after two years.

Her reaction to other dogs is unpredictable, though. She can ignore them totally, or want to play with them or snap at them. On a leash she usually lunges aggressively.

That is why I bought this DVD. So, although Dr Yin's presentation is excellent and valuable, I was disappointed. If, at the end of the DVD, she would state that Part 2 will deal with addressing reactivity more specifically, just a few broad strokes in outline, one wouldn't feel so let down.",1388966400,35,2325,4.4822695035460995

174575,3,0983789274,"This is a painfully slow video of a seminar on reactive dogs.  The good:  the repetition definitely helps you to remember everything Dr. Yin talks about, and she has a very good protocol for dealing with reactive dogs.  The bad:  the repetition!  It is somewhat painful to have to sit through the video where different dog owners make the same mistakes, over and over!",1404345600,2,368,4.6875
174576,5,0983789274,Sophia Yin is a good writer who conveys learning in a simple way with gentle methods. You see results quickly which means that you will continue with the training.,1402617600,,163,4.655172413793103
174577,4,0983789274,"I like the information, but much of it was a repeat of what was included in the Pet Dogs, Problem Dogs and High Performance dogs. They are sold as a set on Amazon and are complimentary. I didn't think the info was applicable to highly reactive dogs, but was a good foundation for all dog / dog issues.",1398470400,3,301,4.206896551724138
174578,2,0983789274,"In this video, Dr. Yin is running a one-day training conference. At a podium, she goes through a series of ""proof of concept"" slides and videos that translate to to ""treat really really fast to gain your dog's focus.""

She spends about 15 minutes of a 2-hour DVD discussing arm speed. Like, talking about measuring treat delivery in milliseconds.

And yes. It makes sense. She extensively covers this basic concept.

And then spends 60-90 minutes walking a handful of dogs and owners through the exact same exercise, which is: walk backward three steps, call for a sit, treat at light speed. Repeat ad nauseum. It is viewable at Dr. Yin's Blog. Google for ""Dr. Yin Reactive Dog"" and the article should be up top. The only exercise covered in the video is Exercise #1 from the article.

But the video only offers one exercise. All exercises are done in a concrete conference centre. I feel that this video is a huge rip-off for a dog owner that wants to help their dog deal with reactivity.

I paid $36 for this 2 hour DVD. As a comparison, I just paid $36 for the entire Planet Earth series on BluRay. Production quality and content just aren't there to justify the price. Go to the blog article I posted above if you want to learn the exercise (and more!)",1396915200,29,1256,4.539823008849558

174581,2,0983789274,"I was expecting much more than watching a group of participants learn to give treats at the appropriate speed. I know that is important, but an entire hour was devoted to it.",1391817600,14,174,4.46875
174582,5,0983789274,"I have owned dogs all my life and began showing 31 years ago. 13 years ago I got my first small dog, a Parson or Jack Russell Terrier from a good show and hunt line in the UK. Well she quickly taught me that my history with working breeds was useless with my Terror Terrier! I began searching for new ways to train and found positive reinforcement. We years to work I muddled through, showing in conformation, agility, obedience, and earth dog, she also did therapy work and was my medical alert service dog. Although she won many championships and we had a very successful career, i realize after watching this DVD that my signals were a mess. The clear well presented lessons give every person who wants to do a good job building a relationship with their dog and training them no matter what their reactivity problem might be a chance to do so. The best way to watch this is on your television with some room to do the human without dog exercises, it is amazing how much you learn about clear communication with your dog just by doing the exercises. I have competed horses and dogs all my life and been fortunate to take lessons from the top competitors in each field, and never have I seen clear systematic lessons that are measurable so that we at home can really apply what Sophia does to our dogs. I have rescued dogs, cats, horses and parrots for many years and now focus on dogs, these techniques work wonderfully well on the animals I bring in for a short time and have worked very well on my own rescue failure (yes I kept him) a 120 Boer Boel who was dog and human aggressive and most trainers suggested he be put down. He has passed his Canine Good Citizen test and continues to learn and loves his lessons. This DVD is exciting and I cannot wait to see part 2. The opportunity to learn how to train our dogs and fix problems is a huge plus, some of the things seem so simple, like the repeat sits back and rapid treats yet until I watched Sophia and really did it the way she taught I did not get the results she gets. I also love that the dogs in this DVD are real! they mess up! and so do the people, it is so nice to realize that they are people just like me and dogs just like the ones I work and hey I can do this and so can my clients!",1391212800,10,2255,4.1981566820276495
174583,5,0983789274,"Anyone who has ever struggled with a seriously aggressive dog knows how difficult, embarrassing, and sad life can be with said animal. I have one such creature, and I'm not lying when I say this dog sent me to tears every time we walked past another human being or another dog. She's crazy impulsive and reactive. And I went through EVERYTHING trying to figure out how to work with her. I followed all the suggestions. I did what I thought were the ""right"" methods, but none of them ever stuck. None of them ever produced any long-lasting effects in myself or my dog... until we saw Dr. Yin's methods for training reactive dogs. Suddenly, I realized that what we were missing was a strong foundation. In this video, Dr. Yin goes through meticulous detail to drive home the message that it is all about a strong foundation and handler skill. She pinpoints exact areas that you need to focus on by yourself before trying with a dog. Like: how are you standing? How fast are you able to reward the dog? Did you inadvertently reward the wrong thing? Is the dog staying focused and happy? Basically, she breaks every technique down into small bite-sized exercises that you can focus on to make sure that you're really teaching what you want the dog to learn. The best part is that, even though aggression is a really complicated behavior and we probably don't understand it all very well, Dr. Yin's methods ensure that - no matter what - your dog just learns to stay focused on you and to be happy doing it. The rest falls by the wayside. It takes a lot of work and practice, but it gets you strong, consistent, fast results. Plus, this video is approved for CE credits, so that's excellent for veterinary professionals like myself! This is really great work! I'd recommend it wholeheartedly as someone's first line of defense when they are confronted with a reactive or aggressive or hyper dog!",1391212800,3,1890,4.627976190476191

7795218,5,0983789274,"I bought several of Dr Yin's items, in hopes I can help my VERY leash reactive/aggressive 10 month old, 80 pound, male doberman. With the situation quickly moving from just dogs as the antagonist to everything; children, bikes, skateboards, etc., I needed help. I read everything I could find, and then stumbled onto Dr. Yin, so I read everything I could on her website, and reviews, and decided to try her DVDs in hopes she had something more concrete to learn. She DID!!  This DVD was extremely helpful and just what i was looking for in that it teaches you step by step, and while it can repetitive in parts as you watch her work with individual dogs and owners, it's great to see a training technique enough times with different dogs that it sinks in. This DVD is of her teaching a class with dog owners, where you see EXACTLY how to learn the techniques and then teach your dog. She starts with teaching the people how to do the exercise and practice it before working with their dogs. As with dancers, if the lead person doesn't know the steps inside and out, how can they possibly lead the other. You can't expect your dog to know what you want if you don't immediately lead them into the next step and movement. I found this to be the most helpful... to teach me the exercise that I can practice, then show me how to work with my dog doing the exercise.

it's well worth the money. and if you have a dog like mine, who couldn't care less about you when it sees something it wants to go after, then I highly recommend this as it teaches the dog to pay attention to you. It also teaches you what to do when something happens that would normally distract the dog, or in my case, when he sees a dog 2 blocks away and goes ballistic.  there is also a Part 2 DVD that is a continuation on this one, which I have not had a chance to watch yet, but will post a review when I do.",1426032000,4,1878,4.240223463687151
