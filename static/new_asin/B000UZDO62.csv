2927373,5,B000UZDO62,"I had NO idea that this was even being created! I just happened to be browsing for future purchases, visited Futurama which I plan to buy the series eventually and to my surprise I found this! I must say that I am very excited to see Futurama coming back at least in a sense!",1189987200,5,275,4.111111111111111
2927374,5,B000UZDO62,"Yes! The Year 3000 is back!! This is all-new material, NOT RECYCLED or from 4 seasons offered in volumes 1-4 or Monster Fun. All new from the Simpson's creator Matt Groening and the Futurama team.

It's here the first of the 4 ""NEW"" FUTURAMA direct-to-DVD videos, 3 of which will be released throughout 2008. Following ""BENDER'S BIG SCORE"" will be, ""INTO THE WILD GREEN YONDER"" then, ""BENDER'S GAME"" and THE BEAST WITH A BILLION BACKS."" The features will be cut into an episode format to air eventually on Comedy Central, not Cartoon Network.

Each of these feature the brilliant original voice talent, from the short-lived fox series: John Di Maggio (as Bender and others), Dave Herman (as the Honorable Mayor C. Randall Poopenmayer and more ) Katey Sagal (Leela), Phil LaMarr (Hermes), Lauren Tom (Amy Wong), Billy West (Fry, Zoidberg, Farnsworth, an other Futurama, but known as Stimpy and from the Howard Stern Show, West does the best LARRY FINE in the business), old school veterans like Frank Welker (here for Nibbler but he's the original Fred Jones, if you saw Saturday morning, you can bet he was in it) and Maurice LaMarche (as Morbo, but LaMarche was on the original Transformers, amoung other projects)  and Tress a.k.a. ""Skinner's Mom"" MacNeille (most recently played the ""Spider-Pig"" in Simpson's Movie). This time around Sarah Silverman is a guest along with others, like Star War's Mark Hamill.

The Story:
The Planet Express crew are back, only to be accidently sold to evil nudist aliens in an internet racket (remember kids don't give out personal info. on-line). The aliens desire information and upon learning the secret of paradox-free time travel is tatooed onto Fry's butt, the turn Bender into an evil (well more-evil) time-traveling killing/stealing machine. Incidently, Leela nearly wed, a major character is beheaded and the Universe is torn asunder.

This paradox-free nature creates an op for lots of return appearances and cool cameos. The opening credits goof nicely on the epic-DVD movie release, filled with glam-shots of the characters and their full names. Any questions explained are quickly replaced by more confusing questions.
The spirit of the original series is easily matched and able to sustain the 89 min. movie format.

As always the Futurama DVD extras are insanely funny and worthly of the name ""special features."" For example, a full-episode of ""EVERYBODY LOVES HYPNOTOAD"" (a 20+ min. gag that you need to let run in its course to fully appreciate the joke), an animated promo for Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, a MATH LECTURE, I said a ""MATH LECTURE"" really! Many of the Producers & writers involved with Futurama are Math Majors even PHDs. So the Math Lecture is a full segment in which a Math Prof. discusses and explains the use of math in the original series as well as the new material. The lecture also explains the ALIEN SYMBOLS and even reveals a hidden character to help truly OCD fans to decode the latest symbols.
Other extras include Comic-Con full-cast Futurama comicbook reading!

I can't wait for the next installment of the DVD series.",1188518400,198,3101,5.009708737864078

2927376,5,B000UZDO62,"If I am not mistaken this movie came out between the original cancellation and the show being picked back up. Like with other animated shows that have a cult following, it's a great thing to have. It's like having a longer bonus episode in my opinion, for what it's worth!  I admit it has been a while since I watched this movie.  The only gripe I really have about it is the packaging.  Cheap cardboard sleeve so potential buyers should be aware of this. Just be careful when removing your disc from the sleeve when you wish to view the movie, because otherwise you're going to scratch it.  I fixed this by using a plastic jewel case for a CD and putting the disc in that then sliding the CD case down in the cardboard sleeve.",1439596800,2,727,4.323529411764706
2927377,5,B000UZDO62,"Very funny and jam packed with features, my only complaint is the damn carbon neutral cases that all futurama stuff comes in now. It is cardboard and it can scratch the disks.",1437523200,,175,4.5
2927378,5,B000UZDO62,"Great mini-movie from the Futurama crew! This was actually my first introduction to Futurama, and it's been a lot of fun - some sources even vote it the best Futurama of them all (although I actually don't agree...)! A great plot, some melodrama, plenty of laughs, adult humour, and the Hypno-toad! But not everything is great - for example, although they're a brilliant creation, I wonder if they couldn't have actually found a better name for the annoying-voiced aliens than simply ""the scammer aliens"" (cuz that's what they do - they scam). Maybe something math derived? The Robot Santa is silly, as is the Chanukah zombie (voiced by Mark Hamill!!) and so is the Kwanzaa-bot, and the grand finale leaves a bit to be desired; the episode with the narwhal is very slow, and I'm not sure I buy the whole Lars thing. But the story has so much going for it in terms of goofy lines and loveable antics that it's a total win. Love it.

So many interesting moments! We learn Bender's email address is bender@ilovebender.com (of course, if you actually try to go to www.ilovebender.com, you only get Fox Movies' website - boooo!!! I wonder if there was ever anything cool there when they launched this material for Comedy Central in 2008). ""So what does this mean for us and our many fans?"" Decapitations. ""In Jamaica, we've got 10-storey office buildings lower than that."" Dr Goodandsexy. ""I'll show her who's immature!""... ""He needs a daddy."" ""He HAS a daddy!"" ""No, he got two half-daddys!! Come, White, let's find you a handsome new father.""... Nude Beach Planet... ""You know, it's funny..."" ""What?"" ""Your wiener!!""... ""Hey Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass."" ""I support and oppose many things, but not strong enough to pick up a pen."" Gummi-Fungus. ""I call keep-offseys."" ""No callseys!!"" ""I'm sciencing as fast as I can."" ""I can do more than talk - I can pontificate!"" Midichlorians attack!! Barbados Slim, aka BS. ""Preposterous twoddlecock."" ...""Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people."" ""In self defense?"" ""That too.""... ""I think I""ll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter."" ""You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg."" Harlem Globetrotter physicists. ""Funky cold medina. Awww, snap!!"" ""Ha ha, you missed... oh great master."" ""I blew him to mush like a midget in a microwave."" ...""I saved 40% of your rectum."" ""That's all you need!""... ""I love the Head Museum at night. It's where I come to be alone."" ""Come Leela, let me show you the hall of screaming skulls. It's so romantic!"" ""Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow honkies."" ""The Force is with us, but that's about it..."" Al Gore in the Achilles Vent of the solid gold death stars - awesome!! ""You haven't seen the last of Barbados Slim. Now goodbye forever!"" ""Earth's highest award for swindling - the dirty double cross!"" Great use of Scott Walker's ""30 Century Man"" song. Wow!!

Nibbler: So what'll it be: unconditional surrender...
Leela: NEVER!
Nibbler: ...or total destruction?
Leela: ALSO NEVER!!""
Nibbler: You have 30 seconds - make up your minds.
Leela: NEVERRRRRR!!!

Great bonus features! ""Futurama Returns"" (8:51), a live comic book reading from the Futurama cast from Comic Con. Deleted scenes: ""Monte Carlo scene"" (1:23), storyboards, ""Robot Mafia scene"" (0:32), ""Limbo contest"" (1:41). ""A Terrifying Message From Al Gore"" (1:20), Bender vs Gore. Also a hilarious interview with Al Gore about Gore's sound taping for the show, where they talk about recording it in Gore's hotel suite, jackhammers and power drills going off nearby. ""Bite my shiny metal X - a mind-shattering Futurama math lecture"" (26:05) is a recital and investigation of all of the code and math references in Futurama, such as 2nd Avenue, 3rd Avenue, th Avenue, for example ( = pi = 3.14...). The Futurama producers and writers/geeks are in the ""studio audience"" providing answers to the professor's lecture, and we hear one of them recite  to the 100th place.

There are some connections between the series and the other movies, but you can watch it individually and enjoy it.  It might take a little while to get to know the characters, but even if you are not familiar with the characters, the jokes are still really good.

2927420,4,B000UZDO62,"After four solid seasons of sci-fi sitcom gold, ""We're back, Baby!"". Futurama returned with the first of four made-for-video movies(or OVAs)which on its own made for the beginning of the unofficial Season 5 of the series. This was also a major payoff for hardcore fans of the series.

Set about two years where Season 4 ended, Hermes gets his head cut off, and then put in a jar like most of the other long-dead celebrities. At the hospital, Leela meets the heads' attendee, Lars, who starts dating her. After the Planet Express crew accidently give all their personal info to some alien Scammers, they take over the company. Its later shown that Fry has a tattoo of Bender on his butt that contains a code which opens a time travel portal that can take anyone to anytime in the past. The Scammers get control over Bender from a virus, and use him to go back in time to steal treasures from Earth's history, and then waiting out in an underground cave until the future/present. Fry gets sad with being rejected by Leela, so he uses the code to go back in time to 2000 just after he was frozen. The Scammers send Bender back to kill him to make sure the code can't be used against them, and several other time-duplicates are made of Bender and Fry in the process. Bender eventually believes he kills Fry, and then becomes free of the Scammers control in the future.  The Scammers then swindle everyone on Earth, and they all have to move to Pluto. The outcast Earthlings team up with Robot Santa and his holiday army to launch an assault on the Scammers gold-plated Death Stars to take back Earth. Bender's old switcheroo of one of the Professor's doomsday devices defeats the Scammers, although their leader Nudar survived. He is later killed by Lars, who sacrifices himself with an exploding Bender duplicate. It's revealed that Lars was really Fry from the past who spent several years in the 2000s before finding out that he Lars from when Bender attacked him, and froze himself to wake up two years before fry was first let out. Bender then lets out all the other duplicate Benders from the cave, which causes a tear in time and space. This leads directly into the sequal, The Beast Of A Billion Backs.

This was a really good movie. It played on alot of small things from the original series, and blended it together wonderfully in a single story. Granted, the first musical number is kinda bad, although the ""Holy Trinity"" one with Mark Hamill as Chanukah Zombie was great. I really enjoyed this release, and the full episode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad included with the DVD/Blu-Ray is hysterical. Granted, if you're not a fan of Futurama and haven't seen anything of the series prior to this, then you'll really be lost. Although, that alone should be an incentive to go out there and get the last four seasons.",1278892800,,2820,4.636
2927421,4,B000UZDO62,"Good news everyone! The movie is the first of four made-for-DVD Futurama movies due to hit shelves sometime during the next year, and according to the most assuredly never inaccurate source Wikipedia, the eventual plan is to then split them up into episodes comprising a fifth ""season"" of the show to air on Comedy Central.

  While eventual episodic viewing may be planned, BBS is an actual movie in scope and narrative, and is not, as in the case of Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, simply three episodes spliced together and sold on a disc.  It is a full arc, telling a tale of betrayal, time travel, and epic love.  Ok, maybe that is exaggerating, but it's Futurama.

  The brains behind the show couldn't resist taking the opportunity to throw a few VERY thinly veiled attacks on the Fox Network for canceling the series to begin with, plenty of in-jokes to please the faithful fans.  What works so well for Futurama has always been its ability to combine low-brow slapstick and silly humor with extremely sophisticated satire and even a little bit of science, and the movie is no exception.

  There is a level of absurdity displayed in the show and the corresponding movie that borders on genius, and yet the writers are capable of bringing what could be just a series of random jokes together into a well-constructed plot, with sight-gags aimed to reward those who really pay attention. It quite frankly works better as a whole than the theatrical Simpsons Movie, and is certainly light years ahead of the always far inferior, over-rated, emperor has no clothes Family Guy (that's right, I said it!)

  To put it bluntly and to avoid spoiling any of the good jokes or plot points, Bender's Big Score is exactly what fans of the series have been waiting years for, and hopefully is just the first of many such reunions.",1263427200,,1827,4.737341772151899
2927422,3,B000UZDO62,"MAN, I am really surprised how disappointing Bender's Big Score turned out to be.

I am a huge fan of the television series, but something seriously went wrong with the movie. There's almost no humor whatsoever. It's like the writers are desperately holding on to the episodes that are now considered some of the best of the series, and recycled the same plotlines for a film, and not bothering to take the time to include any actual *jokes*. That's honestly the impression I got after watching Bender's Big Score.

It's not completely mediocre- I mean, there's still several segments of the movie that feature solid writing and some great animation (sometimes AMAZING animation even) and there's several moments that definitely bring a smile to my face at least (mostly because they bring back memories of the glory days of the show).

But the storyline and the pacing feel VERY predictable and significantly less funny compared to the style that was presented to us with the series.

I thought the Simpsons Movie was a bit of a letdown compared to the show (older AND newer episodes) and I'm afraid if Bender's Big Score is any indication, Futurama may be following in the same footsteps.

The characters we've come to love from the show are all featured in the movie, but it's like they constantly blurt one a bunch of one-liners throughout the film *just* for the purpose of making an appearance in the movie. It's awkward.

You don't get anything new with this movie I'm afraid- just stick with the 70-plus episodes of Futurama instead.",1258675200,2,1541,4.818181818181818

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!
Following the cancellation of the show (I wonder what ""genius"" came up with that idea???) life was pretty hard without these amazing characters. The comic books are good, but nothing beats the actual show, so it's so good to have everybody back.

2927428,5,B000UZDO62,"This is the first of the four feature-length films comprising Futurama's revival, and it's the most complete effort of the four.  Because of the feature-length format, the writers employ a multithreaded plot that gets tangled at times, but the characterization and multifaceted humor is vintage Futurama, and the movie always feels fun and enjoyable as the plot develops.

Back at Planet Express after a two-year hiatus, the crew head off to make a delivery to a nude beach planet, where they encounter a trio of nudist scammers who dupe them into handing over control of the company.  The scammers soon discover a code for paradox-free time travel into the past on Fry's buttocks; with the code, they hatch a plot to steal all of Earth's treasures and take over the world.  Meanwhile, Hermes is decapitated in a limbo accident, and Leela falls in love with a mysterious stranger named Lars, making Fry jealous.  As expected, things get tangled and confusing after repeated uses of time code (sometimes the time travel reconciles current events, while at other times it overwrites them).  The patient viewer is advised to use the rewind button liberally; things work out in the end, sort of.

The plot is liberally sprinkled with callbacks to the original series that fill things out, but are safely ignored by novices (who can always return to the movie after watching the original series, giving it significant replay value).  The humor is versatile and consistent throughout the movie.  Character foibles, nerd jokes, cultural jokes, running gags, bathroom humor -- Bender's Big Score has it all.

The feature-length format isn't ideal for Futurama (the other three movies demonstrate this more clearly), but Bender's Big Score proves that the show still has plenty to offer.",1234828800,,1778,5.079037800687285

2927430,3,B000UZDO62,"When Futurama first came out, I was convinced it would never last.  Unlike the Simpsons, Futurama makes you feel a bit like a moron when you watch it, with perpetual in-jokes to science fiction and fact that you may only catch years later.  To my delight, Futurama had a very successful run.

One of the last episodes involved the Robot Devil, a favorite character of mine, and the burgeoning romantic subplot between Fry and Leela.  Fry, having traded his hands in for the Robot Devil's hands so that he could play the hypnoflute ultimately has to give the hands back and the episode ends with a sweet but sad little tune imagining Fry and Leela together.  Filled with clever banter, excellent music and choreography, plot twists, and a bittersweet ending, this was Futurama at its finest.

Bender's Big Score is not Futurama at its finest. All of those plots have been discarded.

Mind you, it's not bad.  It's just not fantastic.  Bender's Big Score is a series of muddled plot points, pointless cameos, and a lot of ""hey, look, we gave you what you wanted!"" fan service. It's great to have a DVD comeback of a great show, but I expected better from a feature-length movie.  I mean, Internet scams?  That's so ten years ago!

That said, I'm a huge fan of Hypnotoad.  Twenty minutes of Hypnotoad.  TWENTY.  MINUTES. That's right, twenty glorious minutes of HYPNOTOAD.  ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!

Of the three, I loved BBS the best. There were a lot of funny jokes and I love how they complexly interwove time travel into the movie. When you watch the commentary on, you learn of all the thought that went behind this movie (e.g. numbers in the background) which they didn't do in the subsequent two movies. Couldn't watch the whole Hypnotoad episode. Zzzzzz. 5 stars.

The Beast of a Billion Backs was an interesting story but I personally didn't think it was that funny. 3 and half stars.

Bender's Game was funnier than BBB but I'm not crazy about parodies because if you've missed the parodied movie.... In this case, it was the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy. 4 stars.

I love that they could come back and put together more Futurama. However, they needed less of a bunch of things:
1. Less Hermes.
2. Less decaptiations - yuck, not funny, don't like seeing likeable character maimed like Wile E. Coyote.
4. Less telegraphing the computer spam jokes.
5. Agreed with other posters that roll call at the beginning added nothing to the show.

I did enjoy the way they handled the classic time travellers' problem and found the romantic stuff to be poignant and interesting. And like I said, the CGI rocked very hard. The ""kitten class"" battleships made me laugh, as did the parachutes with kitty ears.

I'd like to have seem more of:
1. Professor Farnsworth
2. Zoidberg
3. References to Slurm
4. The newscasters

2927441,5,B000UZDO62,"Futurama returns to DVD in movie form after two years since being canceled
by Fox TV. Let me say that after being away for two years and returning, they haven't changed a bit. The characters are still as funny and unique as last time and at the start of this movie we're given a very thrilling team roll call.
Futurama has always been known as being extremely funny but mixing comedy with drama. It has the ability to have us in tears of laughter and in tears of emotion and sadness. We are given both feelings in this movie as the story is clever, funny and emotional. Also at the ending we're given one hell of a twist that I genuinely wouldn't have expected.

The story goes that since the team have returned they embark on their first delivery to the nudist planet. While there they're approached by three aliens who we come to know as the scammers who are asked to sign a petition and supply their e-mail address. Also on the nudist planet Leela notices that Fry has a tattoo of bender on his rear which he can't explain but turns out to be more important than we'd first anticipated as it contains the time code.
A few days later the gang start receiving spam e-mails which, one by one scam the team out of money and even bender is scammed when an obedience virus is downloaded to his brain. The scammers come to Earth and Planet Express to reveal that they are now the owners of the company. Upon them also discovering the time code this leads to a whole heap of trouble involving time travel, paradoxes and love.
Oh and Hermes body gets crushed and he ends up as a head in a jar.

Great return of Futurama and I hope this leads to the series being recommissioned by Comedy Central.",1215907200,,1689,4.358730158730158
2927442,3,B000UZDO62,"The story was wild and crazy, I enjoyed it.  Although it did feel slightly like the movie was written to be cut up into different episodes, which in the end didn't serve it very well.

Some of the references in the movie didn't seem very well thought-through and just felt plain contrived.  I enjoyed the story, as it was a very Futurama-esque story, especially how they tie it all together.  Some of the elements they put into it did seem to detract from the overall story though.  Sorry, but having a guest cameo from almost all the characters who ever were in the show didn't seem to move the story along as much as the writers might have thought it would.

Overall, it's worth watching if you are a die-hard Futurama fan, but it doesn't seem to be a strong ""starting-off"" point for the Futurama newbie.",1215820800,,806,4.486301369863014
2927443,4,B000UZDO62,"The film starts with a reintroducing of each character and making fun of the FOX network for cancelling the series back in 2003. After the introduction of the characters, it shows the Planet Express crew playing limbo in one of the rooms at Planet Express and Hermes (Phil LaMarr) being beheaded by one of the swords on the wall which turns into a revamped Futurama show intro. Once the Planet Express crew arrives at the hospital, Leela (Katey Sagal) first meets Lars (Billy West) and appears to have a love interest, which enrages Fry (Billy West). After going to the Hospital, the Planet Express crew decide it is time to taking a relaxing break on a nude beach. Whilst they are lying out, they are approached by three pink soft skinned aliens that ask the Planet Express crew to sign a petition as well as provide an e-mail. The aliens say whatever needs to be said in order to get a signature and e-mail.

Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom), Leela, Zoigberg (Billy West) and The Professor (Billy West) receive spam e-mails and are all suckered into giving personal information to fake causes/prizes. However, Bender downloaded a virus from an e-mail where he thought he could get rich watching porn. Once The Professor signs over the deed for Planet Express, he thinks he will become rich beyond his wildest dreams and this when the film actually starts. The pink soft skinned aliens appear at the front door with the signed deed and Bender (with the iObey virus installed) introduces them as their new masters. The aliens use their sprongers (neck smell/sense glands) to find that Fry's tattoo of Bender is not just a tattoo, but contains a vital binary code that opens a time sphere.

The Leela and Lars relationship seems to grow even stronger the more they see one another throughout the film. Lars seems to truly understand who Leela is and care for her. The aliens decide it is a good idea to vaporize Fry in the fear that using the time sphere will destroy the universe, but before they can, Fry travels back to the year 2000. They instruct Bender to go and assassinate Fry (obvious Terminator Phone Book murderer reference here). Bender succeeds in murdering Fry in 2012, however, in 3007 Fry appears again. A montage explains how Fry lived, moved on from Leela and found his purpose from 2000-2012. Fast forward to the future, Robot Santa Claus tries to kill the Planet Express crew (because they have been very naughty), yet Lars is able to deactivate the bomb and asks Leela for her hand in marriage to which she accepts. Fry fears even more that he is going to lose Leela.

The Planet Express crew as well as hundreds of humans have to relocate to Neptune because Earth was signed over to ""The New Owners"". Whilst on Neptune, they find Santa who is also powerless to the aliens. Everyone on Neptune teams up including: Zapp Brannigan and Kip, Robot Santa, Kwanzaa-bot and Chanukah Zombie to take the Earth back and a space fight with the aliens ensues.  From here I will not tell you anymore as it would not want to spoil the film for you, however, I can say: Fry's life in 2000 is explained, Lars' true identity is revealed, Hermes altercations with his body, wife, and Barbados Slim are hilariously done throughout the course of the film, more action ensues with the aliens, and Bender becomes a hero... Well sort of. I found the ending interesting because it was much like the show's sudden endings, but still funny in Futurama comedic way.
4/5

Picture:
The film is presented in the 1.78:1 (16:9) format. The picture was crystal clear throughout the film. There were only a few instances where the picture became slightly fuzzy for a few seconds, but nothing that is noticeable or that would deter you from watching this film.
4.5/5

Sound:
Even though the film was presented in Dolby Digital 5.1, it sounded more like a Dolby Pro-Logic II Mix. The film sounded no better than the series, due to the fact that the rear left and right speakers were barely used. However, the film made good use of sounds and music, but I just wish they made it a true Dolby Digital 5.1 mix because there were moments when it could have made a big difference.
3/5

Special Features:
The DVD is packed with extra features including: Futurama Returns! (A live comic book reading by the cast), Everybody Loves Hypnotoad, Deleted Storyboard scenes, A Terrifying Message from Al Gore and several others. The only thing I felt was missing was a making of documentary.

Final Thoughts:
I really enjoyed this film and I know it will be a treat for many Futurama fans. The film has several jokes and references to the show which Futurama fans will appreciate and notice right away. I felt that Futurama: Bender's Big Score was worthy of a cinema release. Whilst it was not as good as The Simpsons Movie nor did it have as big a budget, I felt they did a great job. At no time did I feel it was a drawn out episode like I did with Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Colon Movie Film for Theaters.

*Excellent animation quality.
*Loads of great hilarious dialogue and funny scenes (without relying too heavily on catch phrases or old gags).  Also plenty of action and a cute love story (although some of you might hate the romance).
*A few funny bits of self-parody, especially in the opening scene.
*A few of nostalgic homages to older Futurama episodes (expect to see some familiar characters and some references).  Everything was accurate to what the show was.
*I think the story is good.  Even though it technically doesn't make much sense (what with time paradoxes and all), the whole point of Futurama is to make fun of the absurdity of sci-fi.  Therefore, this movie really hits the mark well, and is quite funny when you think about it.
*A few good musical numbers (albiet they are also a little strange).
*Good music score as well.

The Bad Things
*Some parts are weird or gross (like when Hermes gets decapitated).  Most likely, they're trying to make it edgier than the show.
*The romance could be seen as sappy.

Ah, my love for Futurama has never diminished! This movie is every bit as funny, exciting, and thoughtful as the show was.  For anybody who likes the show (or good comedies in general), watch this by all means!

I'm surprised the future wasn't changed....

Other than the ending feeling a little rushed, I don't have any reasons for why this can't get 4.5 or 5 stars. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!!",1209600000,,1042,4.783333333333333

This was bizzare and dreadful, the story is dry and confusing, the characters never do anything funny, exactly unlike the TV show.  It has a couple of laugh out loud moments with Zoidberg, but you will really wish you didn't watch this.  It's too bad the producers decided to sell out their great legacy for a cheap buck.

2927464,4,B000UZDO62,"That would describe what has happened to the Futurama series. It was cancelled after its fourth season by FOX in 2003,but its succesfull reruns on Teletoon and other channels brought the show back after stopping production years ago. It was decided that a direct-to-DVD movie would be made and here comes ""Futurama : Bender's Big Score"".Also announced are three other movies following this one. All the movies are going to be cut in regular 22 minutes episodes and will air on Cartoon network and eventually on other networks(at the time of writting Cartoon Network has already started airing those episodes)later on. This is Futurama's triumphant return and with this settled we can only hope the series won't be cancelled once again! Fans are just glad to be able to watch something new of Futurama and this movie will surely entertain them during its 1 and a half hour span(i have to say it seemed much longer to me,like 3 hours).

This is the first new thing from the show since it has been cancelled and the good thing about the movie is that nearly everyone who had previously worked on the show contributed to the movie and its the same team. The movie as one could expect has plenty of funny sequence,and its exactly what you get here. Bender's Big Score,however is an odd title really as the story isn't really focused on him and after seeing the movie a few times i still wondered why it was called that way. The title of the movie can be misleading. Another great thing,this is all NEW material nothing from the four seasons,entirely new stuff. They putted a lot in the film,in fact maybe a little too much but overral it lives up to the series and i didn't expect it to be this good honestly i expected some kind of flop. The great thing is that while the movie stays true to the serie its not affraid of doing its own thing,tell a different story and being creative but its no perfect be advised.

The story is interresting. After learning they have been cancelled,and then brought back again,the Planet Express company is accidently being solf by causes of tempting spam mails to evil nudist aliens. The aliens can ""smell"" information and they discover a tatoo of Bender on Fry's butt! Now that sounds odd but remember this is Futurama,where everything can happen. That tatoo as silly as it souds holds the secret of time travel with a combinaison of zeros and ones,anyone who reads the entire number sequence can go back in time. Meanwhile Leela meets a nice man unfortunatly for Fry and it turns into a great and quite intriguing story may i add. There is a lot of time travelling and it(the movie)turns out to be quite a surprise and makes you think a lot. The creators even joke about what really happened in the 200 presidential elections and i don't want to tell you too much but expect to see Al Gore a few times in the movie! The extras included are good,nothing supurb but its alright. There is a full episode. 22 minutes of ""Everybody Loves Hypnothad"" wich may or may not be funny depending of you,some trailers a Math lecture(that's right!),the cast reading comic books and some other things. If you are a fan of the show you should enjoy this stuff,if not only most of it. I tought the commmentaries however could have been a little better but still this is worth it if you are a fan.

The story is great and you really get caught in it,and it proves to be another worthy chapter in the Fry-Leela relationship. If this is a preview of the nest three Futurama movies then count me in,i will see them all. It will surprise everyone and you will get a good laugh out of it. I think some characters should have gotten more screen time like Amy who wasn't much at all in it.""Bender's Big Score"" is a great adventure on its own and has proven to be better than fans tought it would probably be,i know i did!4 stars,not a five but still very good and pleasently surprised.",1208304000,3,3891,4.5398860398860394

It isn't horrible, just too damned long and tedious.

Would have been superior if they had spent the money on creating three or four separate 30 minute episodes built around a central plot.

If you felt that the Simpson's failed to translate to a full length movie successfully (I did -- but it was still entertaining), this movie will be a disaster of an experience for you.

The 20 minute hypnotoad is a definite win, though.",1207526400,,489,4.6395348837209305
2927467,3,B000UZDO62,"I started off watching the series on day 1, and wasn't really too in to it. I rediscovered it late in season 3 and was so disappointed when it was cancelled in season 4. I bought all the seasons and would say that it really hit it's mark midway to late in season 1 and was a solid performer, except during Zoidberg-heavy episodes; he's a character best served as a background character. The show has a huge heart and a left-wing agenda, which both suit my interests. Now that I've laid the ground work, here's my review:

This is the first of four direct-to-dvd movies, cleverly written and edited so as to be broken up into 4 1/2 hour episodes to air on tv later on. The story is a bit complicated and difficult to follow, even for the most interested viewers and probably due to the length, has long periods of uninteresting storyline and few jokes. The opening sequence was outstanding, and had it continued along the path of inside Futurama-Fox humor might have been better, but instead involves tying up loose ends and correcting time-travel-continuity errors. It relies on the fact that most viewers were avid and vorracious fans who know all the ins-and-outs of all the storylines and Fry's past and future life (lives). While attempting to continue Fry's pining for Leela and the sexual chemistry/tension between two cartoon characters, it falls short of the emotion and heart found in season 4, specifically the final episode of Futurama's run, the Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings.

Still, it's new Futurama after almost 5 years off-the-air and it does revive the franchise. I figure this is a tune-up for the other three movies, and maybe a stepping stone to a cable/satellite network purchasing more new episodes to air exclusively on their channel. For that, I say it was neither good nor bad - just an establishing new turn for this once creative, intelligent, vibrant and intuitive show. Let's hope it gets it's old magic back in the next dvd.",1207526400,2,1959,4.758823529411765
2927468,5,B000UZDO62,"If you are a fan, Bender's Big Score delivers what you seek. Most of the writers, animators, and actors are back and the final product is very faithful to the style of the series. I was a little let down when I first viewed it, but I realized that this is the same reaction I had to the original Futurama series. The high production quality of this show drew me back to reruns more than any other on TV, and I'm experiencing the same slow embrace of this DVD.

 However, just like the Simpsons movie, it quickly loses steam. The first song featured, ""I might as well jump"", was so childish and poorly written, I couldn't bear to see it! There were too many characters crammed into an overly complex plot, and the new villains were so dull and boring , it was a wonder anyone had thought them up.
Don't get me wrong, I ADORE  the series, and I loved the ""in jokes"", but I really think they were a mistake. Instead of appealing to those who used to watch the show, they should be appealing to those who have never watched it.

I'd like to chalk this up to rust, but given that this is supposed to be Futurama's big comeback, I just can't. It has none of the classic Futurama brand humor of ""A Big Piece of Garbage"", none of the well crafted feeling of ""Jurassic Bark"", and none of the originality of ""The Sting"".

I hardly laughed at all and basically forced myself to watch it hoping it would redeem itself because I hated to see a series I loved so much go down in flames like this.

The premise is okay; certainly enough for a normal episode, but flimsy when stretched out to movie length.  The biggest problem is their insistence on cramming every last cameo character and inside joke from all four seasons of the show into the movie.  It's tedious and unfunny.  The writing in general seems dumbed down and generic as if they're trying to appeal to a larger (dumber) audience.  The two music numbers are embarrassingly bad and by the time Kwanzaa Bot started rapping, I had already decided to eBay my copy.

I notice a lot of reviews here that basically say they didn't like it or it was disappointing, yet give it 4 stars.

All your favorites characters are back and the opening segment introduces them all in such a way that it feels like a happy reunion with old friends you haven't seen in awhile. What I like about Futurama, and what I think sets it apart from other more frenetic and disjointed prime time animated programs such as Family Guy, is the stronger narratives that make their way into numerous episodes (and of course, the geek appeal).

This time around, the jokes more often than not amuse, but taken as a whole, this outing doesn't come near Futurama's best TV episodes. Despite being an animated comedy with a foul-mouthed robot and humanoid lobster, many Futurama episodes had way of tugging at your emotions thanks to good ol' fashioned story telling. Bender's Big Score almost takes this too far and at the expense of laughs. Still, it is definitely worth a look especially for Futurama fans. I would say it is a cut above the Family Guy  Star Wars homage which seemed hastily constructed and not as funny as it could have been (hopefully family Guy fan boys can admit this).",1203033600,,1183,4.628571428571429

A few months ago, reviewer Doug said, ""Here, they're trying too hard to tell a story, at the expense of the jokes."" I agree with his conclusion, but the silly premise -- people in the year 3000 falling for spam? -- was not worth the effort. And I must agree with Doug's inference that the early ""Best Movie Ever!"" claimants must have been paid reviewers. I can't imagine how anybody who's seen a few episodes of Futurama could honestly rave about this movie. The jokes are hardly ""fast and furious,"" as one person posted. They're practically nonexistent.

By coincidence, after I suffered through the movie (and I do mean suffered), we switched back to TV mode just as the Mars University episode was beginning on Comedy Central.

2927512,4,B000UZDO62,"Futurama tries to pick up where it left off a few years ago before this TV series was unfortunately cancelled.  It does a marvellous job, with the usual combination of both nerdy jokes and Bender jokes, but a few things one should know before selecting this DVD -

I speak from someone that owns the DVDs of all of the previous episodes, watched and enjoyed almost all of them.  My enjoyment of this movie was significantly enhanced by my prior knowledge of the show.  Though this is not totally ""for the fans"", I would definitely recommend NOT starting with this one before at least renting the TV episodes and watching several.  There are a lot of references that are not central to the plot, but are more interesting if you know what they are referring to.

They do a very good job with a very, very twisted plot (minor spoiler - there is time travel involved, and whenever you have time travel, you have a twisted plot) and the jokes are great, but you get a nagging feeling that the show runners are not used to turning futurama into a 90 minute movie.  Just a minor quibble on the spacing of jokes and overall pacing.

The general ""blueness"" rating of futurama increased in the transition from TV to DVD movie - probably not appropriate for young children.  Parents, be warned, but it probably makes it more funny for adults!

I think this is an excellent effort, the animation is first rate, and I look forward to the next ones - there will be three more on DVD.",1200787200,,1469,4.468164794007491

2927514,5,B000UZDO62,"After Futurama was canceled, I figured it was better than having it run too long and start to go downhill (like the Simpsons, which only gets about one or two laughs from me per episode nowadays). When I heard they were bringing it back, I worried, naturally, that it would suck.

I purchased Bender's Big Score for my father (who had expressed to me his same fears of suck-age, should Futurama ever be resurrected) for Christmas. Despite our fears, we were all excited at the prospect of seeing the Planet Express crew again after so many years, and in our cautious optimism, we popped the DVD in.

""Good news, everyone!""...It was great! The plot gets a little twisty, as tends to happen when there is time travel involved, but it's manageable. Overall, a hilarious movie. :)

If you are a Futurama fan, you can't NOT buy it.",1200787200,,826,4.605442176870748
2927515,4,B000UZDO62,"Fans of animated TV series are die hard fanatics. Scores have talked up the values of everything from ANIMANIACS to THE SIMPSONS to FAMILY GUY. One thing is certain among them all. They enjoy their shows more than most would think possible. This is true of fans of the show FUTURAMA. Now these fans have reason to rejoice with the release of FUTURAMA: BENDER'S BIG SCORE!

Having never been a fan of the show and having only seen a few scattered episodes, I was pleased to see this DVD offered the same thing found in Matt Groening's other hit animated show, THE SIMPSONS. It takes a look at the world around us and makes fun of nearly everything. But rather than be limited to the here and now, FUTURAMA takes place in...well...the future...and offers a glimpse as to what happens to things some hold dear today.

The show starts off with the Planet Express crew (consisting of time displaced hero Phil Fry, cyclopean heroine Leela, smart alek robot Bender, crab like doctor Zoidberg, professor and all around whiz Farnsworth, youngster Amy Wong and owner Jamaican Hermes Conrad) discovering their service has been canceled by the Box Network executives (a thinly veiled ribbing of the network where the show was canceled 2 years ago). A turn of events leads to a last minute recall and they crew head out to deliver a package on a nudist planet.

While there they begin surfing the net, only to find themselves lured in by spammers who wind up taking over the company and eventually the plant Earth. To help them, they've reprogrammed Bender to do their bidding as well as decipher and put to use a time travel device to steal anything of worth throughout history. In doing so the future is changed and for the crew and friends this means going from bad to worse.

The convoluted plotline around this time travel and the effects it has on all things since the events changed by the backward travel in time is more confusing than this sentence. Thank goodness the Harlem Globetrotters show up to help. I guess.

Can our heroes save the day? Can they find happiness in a topsy turvy world? Will spammers own the planet Earth and turn it into a universal marketing machine? Well at least more of a marketing machine than it seems to be today. Watch and see!

Swipes at politicians, celebrities, fads and more (especially net junkies and spammers) are found throughout this movie. The digs range from subtle to blatant and all are done for laughs. A combination of 2 and simulated 3 dimensional animation are state of the art and render the story in clean, eye appealing drawings.

For all of its pluses, one thing remains for anyone considering this movie. Is it enough for those who aren't fans to enjoy? The answer is yes. Perhaps not enough to add this to your collection, but it does offer a solid evening's entertainment.  And don't think of this as a cartoon for kids. There are definitely adult themes and situations here. But if they can watch THE SIMPSONS, then this one will pass as well.",1200700800,,2997,4.6521739130434785
2927516,5,B000UZDO62,"I saw this film three times and still look forward to more episodes.  Bendernator or Bender as the Terminator time traveling robot made this worth watching.  If the network doesn't turn Bender into a politically correct robot, he'll be worth watching.  I liked the whole Leela/Fry romance and the direction it took.  At least they are still together.  Why if Futurama not as popular as the Simpson's?

A lot of work went into this one.  We get all the main characters back with the exception of the accountant guy who lost his head in the limbo accident.  In future movies I'd like to see more of Zap Branigan or perhaps a series of his own?  I was kind of hoping Shatner could be the voice of Zap's father.  I would like to see a Futurama version of the ""Wrath of Khan.""  While Shatner is still with us, he is 76 this year, he could add something to the Futurama mythology.",1200614400,,874,4.4

That's why I thought it was pretty strange when my wife and I sat there watching Bender's Big Score in pretty much total silence--wanting to laugh, wanting to love it, but not being able to. A chuckle would erupt every once in a while, but that was about it. I see that a lot of reviewers here and elsewhere agree, but many don't. I think that Matt Groening and Co. have misfired here--depending on old gags instead of new gags, depending on a murky, messy plotline. I'm wondering if Groening & Co. simply couldn't handle a long form show. (Consider how the Simpsons movie was just OK, nothing special compared to the better episodes.) Or they were doing a reunion show--which is never as good as the original, which relies on trotting out the old performers who never recapture what they had. And  it looked visually bad, with jaggies galore, but we have an old DVD player and CRT TV; maybe it looks better on an LCD.

2927529,4,B000UZDO62,"They're back!

Futurama, dropped by the Fox Network after failing to reach the popularity of The Simpsons, has finally returned due to fan pressure and great DVD sales.

""Bender's big Score"" is the first in a series of four straight-to-dvd movies that pick up where the series left off.

It seems that the Planet Express Crew have been out of work for two years after the idiotic executives at the ""Box Network"" shut them down. But now those executives have been fired, (and beaten up too) Planet Express is back on the air!

It starts off with the PE crew taking a delivery to the ""Nude beach"" planet. (Don't expect to see any nudity kids, it's all hidden by strategicaly placed stuff.)

Professor Farnsworth accidentaly sells Planet Express to some nudist aliens, who discover the secret to paradox free time travel tatooed on Fry's butt, the rest they say is history.

The first say 15 minutes is a little slow, but after that it really picks up. The story is really well written, while you can watch ""Bender's Big Score"" without having seen the rest of the series, it really helps if you have.

There's a lot of in-jokes and refereneces to earlier episodes.
Remember when Fry was frozen and you saw the space ships destroying the city outside? Ever wondered what that was about? Or how Fry's dog Seymour came to be mumified?

There's some great cameo appearances from characters throughout the Futurama series, Zapp Brannigan, Kiff Kroker, the murderous Santa Robot, Barbados Slim, Cubert Fansworth, plus a few more.

This is a great DVD and a worthy addition to any fan's collection, I really enjoyed watching it and I can't wait for more!",1200096000,,1644,4.7403508771929825

Unfortunately, Bender's Big Score is not like the old Futurama.  They have basically taken several new episodes and mashed and interleaved them into a single movie.  While this must have sounded like a good idea to someone at some time, it definitely doesn't flow well and it really starts to drag around the half-way mark.  It's sad, especially because you can see the threads of the underlying episodes as they weave through the movie and they seem like they would be great on their own.  It wouldn't have been all bad if they had an option to just let you watch the separate episodes on their own, but they inexplicably didn't include that option.

Overall, it was probably worth watching, but perhaps not worth buying.",1200009600,,838,4.621621621621622
2927533,4,B000UZDO62,"Yes, ""Futurama"" is more bent than ""The Simpsons"" and is certainly more hyper in the way it tells its jokes and story.  Still, it is a whole lot of fun.  They send up the series being cancelled, Internet Scammers, how we foolishly fall for Internet Scams, tattoos, the transitory nature of modern ""love"" relationships, every Time Travel convention and twist, and wound a goodly number of our society's sacred cows and social conventions.

I really enjoy the way ""Futurama"" manages to keep things with a sharp edge no matter how frenetic or silly the story seems to be.  This story also manages to bring back all our favorites from the show including the very bad Robot Santa (or is he really bad all the way through?).  We also get a generous helping of celebrity voices showing up in bit parts with Al Gore playing his head.  You decide if the movie is sending him up or letting him tell jokes that support his agenda or both.

But for me, besides Bender, the real reason to enjoy ""Futurama"" is the cyclop eyed Leela and her search for who she really is and finding a true love.  And she is given one of the central plot points.  So, of course I recommend it.  Little kids won't get the jokes, but teens and up will enjoy it a lot.

The movie seems to suffer from the same problem as The Simpsons.  There were still some funny jokes, but they weren't topical.  Too many of the jokes were just paying lip-service to funny episodes from earlier in the series and didn't add anything to the story.  Also, far too many plot twists.  I understand that the movie was intended to be split into episodes, but it felt like different people worked on different parts and just tried to stitch them together.

And the humor wasn't quite the level I would expect out of Futurama. Even though Futurama and the Simpsons is created by the same guy, Futurama always had their own distinct humor that was different from the Simpsons. But to me this movie seemed more like the humor was written for the simpsons. And when i saw the end for the movie i just sat there for like a minute without moving, in disbelief that it ended, there didn't seem to be a a good beginning, funny middle or solid ending.

I personally do not find the character terribly interesting, but there is lots of Hermes in the movie if you really missed the two joke cliche reggae/bureaucrat. The alien antagonists are very underwhelming, and not very funny either... not a good way to start out Futurama again. I guess people are just happy to have it back after it was ended prematurely.",1199664000,,795,4.802919708029197

I rated this recent effort 3/5 stars because the typical humor I have grown to enjoy from the televised series was absent (or atleast reduced).  I can't really put my finger on it. Maybe the longer duration caused the humor to be diluted somewhat. I think the storyline was okay but the writers attempted to ""Geek-it-up"" too much by referencing today's internet society and norms. The spam/internet/identity theft references were humorous but not enough to carry the whole program.  The time travel plot was intenersting and how it tied together wild diverging storylines to make sense - in the end.

It's hard not to love these characters, of course, and the way that the time-travel paradoxes are dealt with in this movie?  Well, it's pitch-perfect.  My only complaint--and what keeps this movie from really excelling--is pacing.  It's been rumored that Fox is going to create a ""Season Five"" out of recut versions of the direct-to-video movies after all of them have been released.  If that's the case, then I suppose some of the more redundant moments and slow movements may be necessary to build in commercial breaks, ""To Be Continued"" spots, etc.  In this iteration of the film, though, they just seem clumsy.  In that area, ""Futurama"" could take a note from ""Family Guy,"" whose DTV feature was a movie first and a (bizarrely recut) TV special second.",1199577600,,1062,4.708108108108108

The future is as zany as ever and in this flick the properties of time travel are pushed to the absolute limits. The trouble all starts when the gang has a delivery to the Nude Beach planet. I must say it was wonderful to see Leela in the nude. She has a BEAUTIFUL backside. Anyway, they all get scammed into giving out personnel information to alien crooks who go on and eventually scam the entire planet earth of it's treasure and resources. The final step was when President of Earth Nixon got scammed in a fake lottery. Bender is controlled by the aliens, Planet Express is Scam Headquarters, and the gang is homeless and singing in the street.

The reason why this movie deserves four stars and not five in my book is because they tried to do what Family Guy did and that was make a long episode that seemed like a movie. It also had some movie elements and lasted longer but it still didn't quite work. It seemed like an episode that was to long and the absolute worst part was the introduction. It seemed more like a cheesy home-made intro to someones fan-based story.
But bad things aside...

This movie was great! Many funny punchlines and twists. But the best part were the nerd aliens. The Matt Groening team seems to be able to pull out hits left and right with theme songs such as ""Spiderpig"" and ""We took your stuff"". Tho some moments were a little under-developed others were what made this ""movie"" worth seeing.

Simply put: I can watch this movie again and laugh. Not many movies can do that. Now how many times it takes before I stop laughing I still don't know, lets hope that never happens :P",1199491200,,1094,4.357843137254902

As a big fan of the series it would have been difficult for anything to fully live up to my expectations for this film but it was very enjoyable and the more I watch it  the more I enjoy it.

The film features cameos from many past characters though they occasionally seem thrown in as a fan service rather than to serve a purpose in the plot.  It also features two original musical numbers though neither is as catchy as songs from the shows original run.

My main concern with this item is the packaging. When I read that this would be a carbon neutral release I didn't consider what that meant to the consumer. The packaging is cardboard rather than plastic and holds the DVD in a thin slot which it must be slid in and out of. I am somewhat concerned that this leaves the DVD open to damage when being inserted and removed from the packaging.

This should be used as a textbook example of things you should not do when writing comedy for a series. Almost every line is a forced joke, and most of them are reused jokes from past episodes. Just about every character is brought back, unnaturally forced into the plot for reasons I can't understand. The plot is all over the place and has no flow. They dropped the ball, bigtime. I hate to say it, but this was actually worse than a Simpson's clipshow episode. Probably not even worth renting.

2927564,3,B000UZDO62,"I'm a big fan of Futurama (the series) and have each of the 4 seasons on DVD.  The series had some great moments - the Slurm factory, making sweet sweet snu snu with gigantic Amazon women, the post-writer's strike version of ""Single Female Lawyer"", poppler problems, and Gender Bender chief among them.  The series on TV could be just hi-larious, and eminently re-watchable.  So, I had great expectations for this ""full length"" movie.  It's cute, sure, and has its funny moments.  But after seeing it once, I don't think I'll be needing to watch it again.  ""Bender's Big Score"" isn't really about Bender, one of the great characters on the show.  Instead, Bender is used by cyber-spammers to steal things.  And while Bender certainly loves to steal things, doing so at someone else's bidding takes away his humanity (so to speak).  Then the movie gets into the paradox of time travel and then just gets bound up in the twists of the plot.  Not sure how someone could give it 5 stars - is this really the best the show's writers and producers could do such that it could not be improved??  Hardly.  Since I found it somewhat disappointing, and probably won't be watching it again, I'm giving it just 3 stars.  I'd recommend purchasing one of the seasons on DVD instead of this ""movie"" if you don't already have them - you'll laugh more.

Like the problem with the last Seinfeld episode, this one tries to serve too many masters.  The writers struggled with trying to relive all the highlights of the series, introduce new characters, tie up loose ends, and move the series forward while being held together by a precarious plot thread complete with an oddly non compelling, even predictable, cliff hanger.  Also, a number of series long conceits were kind of run over, including uncover Nibbler being exposed and dispersal of the hysterical fear caused by the ultimate ""bad Santa"". The metaphorical air was let out of the tires.
What the Major League Baseball All-Star game is to the real playoffs this piece was to the original series. All the familiar characters were there but the demands of the story did not really call for all of them and many were included just for appearance sake.

2927568,2,B000UZDO62,"As I watched this movie I tried very hard to find something to laugh at, but it just was not there.  The luster and joy that was the original Futurama series was completely absent in Bender's Big Score.  It seemed as though the writers cast aside the characters' usual personalities and antics and attempted to float the boat by doing nothing more than reintroducing old characters and referencing old situations.  Very doubtful Futurama will find new fans with this kind of weak writing, and they just might lose the old fans in the process.  There was just nothing new and inventive and it dragged horribly; by the last 20 minutes I kept looking at the clock eager for the movie to be over so I could go do something more interesting.  I have to say that I was disappointed to the point of embarrassment for the writers, producers, and voice actors.  This is definitely not the fast paced, gut-busting Futurama that I still watch daily in 22 minute DVD episodes. I'm hopeful that the next movie they release will be better (now that all the characters have more than adequately been reintroduced), but I may not be so willing to part with my hard earned money next time to find out.",1199232000,4,1184,4.587677725118484

There were some very funny parts, but they were few and far between.  I really don't think I was expecting much in the way of comedy either, as my favorite episodes are the character driven, newer ones (""Jurassic Bark"", ""The Sting"", ""Roswell That Ends Well"", and ""The Devils Hands are Idle Playthings"").

The movie will be fun for fans to watch, tons of callbacks and other references that aficionados will appreciate. Other then that the movie is a poorly put together series of events that only hint at the greatness that was Futurama. One of my biggest complaints about the movie is the almost disconnected flow from scene to scene. It felt like individual teams of people with only a basic outline of the plot wrote and created each segment, then everything was stitched together in a semi-coherent format.  It contained none of the polished feel of the series and definitely no where near the caliber of the The Simpson's movie.

The plot is pretty weak especially for an 88 minute movie. The premise that most of earth falls prey to email scams provides a perfect vehicle for tired, worn out jokes that would have been more amusing about 10 years ago. But that seems to be the foundation of the movie, pull out all of the staple story lines from the series: Bender steals, Fry-Leela relationship, incompetent Dr. Zoidberg, slightly mad Professor , and  try to turn it into a story. Not that there is anything wrong with any of these story lines (I would enjoy less Fry-Leela relationship) but in this movie they are not delivered with the same creative wit and timing that made the series great.",1199145600,,1446,4.596899224806202

Not to the point that they sound like different people, but without the energy they need to pull this off.  Worst of all was the writing, though.  No wonder this went straight to video!

Hell, even The Simpsons Movie showed Bart's surprisingly small yellow hoo-hah, had Marge spewing ""G0dd@mn it!"" and Homer flipping the bird.  We didn't even get close to any envelope in this movie, let alone push upon it, over which I have to scratch my head, given what I see as Futurama's place of TV programming honor on Adult Swim.  If any TV animation series would step up to the freedom of creativity for the big screen, I would think Futurama would be the one.  No, I wasn't expecting a mind-shattering torrent of nonstop F-bombs a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jay-and-Silent-Bob-Strike-Back-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B00003CY67/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (Dimension Collector's Series)</a>, nor was I expecting the, ahem, free flowing sexual content of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caligula-The-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000TEUSJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caligula (The Unrated Edition)</a>.  But, yeah, I was expecting some measure of extremely irreverent yet intelligently comedic rule-bending, but alas, the closest we got was an opening from Groening and crew poking Fox in the corporate eye for canceling them way back a-when.

In short, there was a lot they could have done, and it was yet another missed opportunity.  So, what you've got here is a 98-minute episode, involved, deep, at times confusing, self-referential, and typically rambling.

But did I like it?  Well of course I did.  Who could not like another installment of Futurama, be it a regular episode, or a big, movie-like episode?  I thought it was very funny, entertaining, and I was sad that it was over.  I even watched the feature again, right away.

As others have pointed out, despite what the trailers seem to construct, the story isn't really about Bender scoring big.  Well, maybe.  The title could've been ""Universal Scammers,"" ""Kicked in the Frauds,"" ""Zen and the Art of Time-Sphere Maintenance,"" or just about anything else you could think up.  The story is absolutely all over the place, zapping from place to place, and time to time, so quickly that this just as easily could've been called ""Zorzax's Meta-Narrative."" In the end, the movie's title is completely irrelevant.

The saving graces were the special features.  The Simpsons Movie DVD was an absolutely mind-bendingly, shatteringly, screamingly massive disappointment when it came to extras, and I expected more of the Futurama DVD production.  It, too, was a letdown, but not quite as big.  The extras are pretty good, but could've been better.  I thought the commentary was flat-out dull, both flat and monotonous, despite their trivia-rich insights and stories.  It was tone of voice, coming through to me as not bored, but mostly tired, just not excited and animated.  The trailers are pretty stock and uninspiring, and the Gore eco-bit did not inspire me.  Nor did the live comic book reading with the convention audience, which I though suffered from low production value.

There's a vignette with the crew receiving a lecture on the relationship between Futurama and math, which is pure gold-pressed latinum for the hardest-core trivia nerds, and what I thought was a good nod to the crew, to actually see them and give them something more than a name line in the titles (but also suffered from low production value).  I learned that there are not one but two no-shazbot alien codes in the series, which have long been cracked by viewer-nerds, who have been laughing for years at some of the most esoteric of in-jokes.  This bit was very good, but left me feeling like a failure as a fan.

The best part of the extras was ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad!""  This is an inspired bit of satire--a bit to which they truly committed--really the kind of thing I was expecting from the film.  It's great stuff, an almost full-length sitcom featuring your favorite mind-controlling amphibian.  Stick with it, and it pays off.

In conclusion, more than anything I was disappointed in that I wanted this production team to really unleash what I know to be some wicked comedic intellect potential.  It's there, obviously, as it is in every episode, but for whatever reason, this movie wasn't the vehicle for that.

Man, that extra feature of the hypnotoad episode was so f-ing funny.  It was the perfect TV show, you knew when you did not have to pay attention and when you did.

The staff of this amazing thingy is practically all PhDs, oh the maths, children!  The show itself is great, any time when a large variety of characters are put together you really can play off of each of them.  The jokes bounce from one genre to another, and the entire thing is just one big twist!  Welcome back guys, don't leave again.

2927584,4,B000UZDO62,"It is hard for an author to satisfy fans after years of absence and months of great anticipation. Ones expectations will always exceed the reality, and thus, people are always disappointed.

Such is the case with Futurama: Bender's Big Score. Have fans legitimate gripes with the latest installment in the Futurama universe? Yes. But the pros at least negate the cons.

I am satisfied with this straight-to-DVD movie for the following reasons: 1) The animation is well done. Though Fry, in particular, looks slightly different than the Fry we all remember (mostly around the eyes), it is very subtle, and all other characters look exactly as I remember them. 2) The writing is still very witty. With a plot that is incredibly convoluted, the writers were not afraid to take jabs at themselves and their plot, while at the same time coming up with new jokes and clever jabs (Bender is still in great form). 3) For Futurama fans, so many references are made to the original four seasons that this alone will keep a fan pleased. The writers did not forget their original four seasons and made many references to them, and even used this movie to explain certain things (how Fry's dog got fossilized, for instance). I appreciated the writer's attention to maintaining story continuity.

For these reasons, Futurama: Bender's Big Score is certainly no miss, and indeed, it satisfies where it needs to. That said, there are a number of legitimate complaints a fan can have:

1) In order to bring in so many characters from the original four seasons, the writers took away the power from certain characters--Nibbler and Robot Santa, for instance. In the few original episodes where Nibbler talked and we got to see his home planet, Nibbler, while cute, certainly had a powerful role--saving the world from evil brains, twice. In this movie, he suddenly begins to talk again but then becomes impotent. For the rest of the movie all he does is nag and is promptly ignored. Likewise, Robot Santa degenerates from an evil creature with a sarcastic wit to a sniveling cretin who whines because his naughty list was stolen by scammers. Even in the final battle, he does very little--Quanzabot fires a missile and Robot Santa just... cheers.

2) The plot is far too convoluted, which is actually something recognized by David X Cohen in the special features. It was too confusing and a little weak, which is natural with time-travel plots, as again Cohen admits. They set out to try to do a time-travel plot right but failed, only redeeming themselves with their tongue-in-cheek demeanor and self abasement. There are far too many holes in the story that just don't make sense yet (for instance, Bender is the one that put that tattoo on Fry's arse to begin with, right? And he got the tattoo to put on Fry's arse from... Fry's arse. So how did it get there to begin with?) Let's not forget that the reason the Roswell episode did so well (and won an Emmy), even though it was a time travel plot, was because they worked out all possible bits of circular story telling (except for the silly ""Fry is his own grandpa"" bit--which was the entire joke to begin with). The story could have been better actualized, but even for what it is, it is still a vehicle that carries many great gags.

3) The songs seemed forced, unnatural and... awkward. Even the song on Neptune, which others excused, seemed a little forced and unnatural. None of the songs in this movie can stand alongside any of the songs from the series. Additionally, the background score is often conspicuous and out of place (the strange repetitious howling music during the montage romance between Leela and Lars, for instance.)

These nit-picky complaints aside, the movie is, overall, quite satisfactory, with plenty of replay value and some good jokes in very Futurama-ish fashion. It is not as good as the series, but it is hard to be when fans have placed the series on a sort of untouchable pedestal and maintain an opinion of it that might be a little unfair. Even though I was slightly disappointed, I am looking forward to the next straight-to-DVD movies.",1198800000,4,4111,4.78169014084507

The plot felt a little like it was there simply as a vehicle for jokes and series references, but it serves that purpose amazingly well and even has some heartfelt happy/sad moments.

Not having time to watch the whole thing at first, we sat down on X-Mas afternoon and watched ""Everyone Loves Hypno-Toad"" in its entirety. Great, we thought, can't wait for later... What a disappontment. The only smiles came in the recognition of old faces.. it was more a roll-call than a movie. The plot was weak, the aliens' nudity unnecessary to the story and uninteresting, the anticipated romance sadly missing, the jokes thin on the ground. Al Gore had the funniest line, of course, but there wasn't enough of him - or of the series' funniest characters, such as Zoidberg or Zapp Brannigan. And there was way too much Hermes, the least amusing character from day one. Having him repeatedly decapitated just was not funny, sorry. And his wife, previously a dedicated spouse, was totally out of character in her race to replace her torso-less hubby with her old beau, Barbados Slim, who had way too many lines. The reading of the comic in the extras section was sadly a mirror of this movie - like Bender's Big Score, the comic series looks great.. until you start reading it. Just. Not. Funny. Ever!

First off; this is likely the only chance to see this footage in this format.  If and when the movies are cut up to make new episodes, large bits will undoubtedly be lost. Secondly, its a visit with old friends.  All the voice talent is back, the animation returns with the same quality and the writing is sharp. The first half starts off with a reintroduction of nearly every in-joke and character you saw in 5 season's worth of episodes.  If this were all the DVD was, it wouldn't rate nearly as highly.  However, after the plot starts rolling, it keeps winding back and forth over itself into a delightful knot, with the same qualities and plot twists that made the original show great (to say any more would ruin the fun).

They also tried too hard to reintroduce the show to new viewers.  I am normally a huge Futurama fan.  I haven't said ""robot"" in years, instead I've adopted Zoidberg's ""robit"".

Not the Seinfeld kind of nothing, but a kind of empty pit where the comedy should have been.  The first forty-five minutes of this 89-minute feature had, perhaps, three laughs and those were more like chuckles, not the kind of wiping the tear from your eye laughs that I'm used to from Futurama.  The GF and I looked at each other at that point and decided to take a break from the movie and go do other stuff, like housework, because it was more entertaining.  While it was great to see the characters again, they did relatively little, acted like fools (which was not necessarily atypical, but seemed somehow amiss - Fry is the primary fool) and generally bungled the schtick.  To be fair, when I was able to force myself to resume watching the next night, the fourth segment sort of pulled things together and wound up relatively strong, but it wasn't worth the sheer volume of boring junk which went before.  Seriously, this could have been a funny 30-minute episode, but it just isn't feature-length material.  As the caption says, one star for bringing the series back, another to keep the last disks in production, but I won't be pre-ordering those - they'll be strictly rentals.",1197244800,32,1306,4.643478260869565
2927630,3,B000UZDO62,"I was disappointed.  'Bender's Big Score' tries too hard to reference every previous episode and include every character from the original show, and ends up being one of those cast reunion specials no one can stand.  It is also a little a little like one of those ""Remember that time when..."" type shows they used to put in sitcoms when they didn't want to write anything new.  Maybe it wasn't quite as bad as that, but pretty bad; a lot of recycling going on.  ""Reduce, re-use, and recycle"" should not apply to comedy.  The plot was all over the place and included flimsy pretexts to include characters that didn't belong.  It included none of the normal plot continuity you'd expect and none of the typical one-liners, the exception I remember being Bender saying, ""Hey!  I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me!""

There is one thing you may want to consider when reading these reviews, though: I, like most people who bought the movie as soon as it was available, am a big fan of Futurama. I have found in the past that the kind of anticipation felt by fans while waiting for a new release of a favorite to come out generally leads to disappointment.  Still, being as objective as I can, the writing on 'Bender's Big Score' was sub-par.

On the other hand, the episode of 'Everybody Loves Hypnotoad' included in the DVD extras kept me in stitches for the entire time it was playing.  At least in it they focused on one plot line and the jokes that made sense for that plot.  Well, two plot lines if you include speed-dating.",1197244800,6,1575,4.430555555555555

As a fanboy, I love it, but if you don't know every episode inside and out, you might not be down.

After seeing for the first time, I was slightly let down - the long format does not work for Futurama (just like it did not work for the Simpsons Movie). However, after watching it again - and again - I must say that it still has everything that made me a Futurama fan. Great story with clever references and hidden humour. I usually hate timetravel in films, but the writers managed to make it as much fun and as little annoying as possible (paradox correcting time travel). Great music. Touching story about Fry & Leela. Bender. The professor saying ""I am the professor!""

It is to animated prime-time series on Fox what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy-Vol-1-Seasons-1-2/dp/B000083C6V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy, Vol. 1 (Seasons 1 & 2)</a>&nbsp;is to... er... well, you get the idea.

One would think the executives at Fox would have done everything they could to keep this show on the air. After all, Matt Groening's other show seems somewhat popular, and you'd think they'd want to keep him happy. But, no. They gave it an awful time-slot (should have followed ""The Simpsons""), and kept delaying it for football. This is much the same way they've been treating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-of-the-Hill-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JM3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King of the Hill - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;for quite some time now.

""Bender's Big Score"" is the first of a series of new episdes destined for Comedy Central, where it's unlikely they will be delayed by football. It's a collection of four episodes that will later be aired on the network but for now can be bought on DVD.

This little four-part movie highlights much of what was very, very good about ""Futurama"". There's lots of clever jokes and sci-fi references for the geek among us, plenty of swipes at Fox (well-earned ones), and a few amusing scenes with Al ""Finally I get to save the Earth with lasers instead of slide-shows!"" Gore.

The animation was also very good, as it always was on the program. The voice-acting is superb, and the story is... well, forgetable in parts. The Scammers were really annoying, which I'm sure they were meant to be, but something that repulsive shouldn't take up that much screen time. And why not have the bad-guys be Mom or Lrrr, as another reviewer suggested?

Despite that minor issue, this is a great return for the series and a great DVD (though, frankly, the cardboard case is crap. Mine already has a couple crush-marks on it. Why not put into a standard plastic keep-case?). The math seminar was interesting, and the dramatic reading of the comic was really great. Plus there's a terrifying message from Al Gore (called ""A Terrifying Message from Al Gore!""), and an entire episode of ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad!""

Overall I'm pleased with this DVD and if the next four are like it, I'll think my money well spent... even if it does mean spending $80 for 16 episodes...

2927658,2,B000UZDO62,"I have been a big fan of Futurama. The first three seasons were outstanding and the fourth was very good. It bothers me to watch the last season sometimes, though, because you can see the quality slipping. I'd hoped that, with the time off, the writers would have come up with some really great stories.

But wow, this was weak. So little genuinely funny stuff. Too much of the achingly over-done Fry-Leela angst. A villain that's simply an absurdist incarnation of contemporary internet scams--and wow, was that the weakest social commentary you've every seen in your life?? And the shock of realizing that a thousand years in the future, there's still a lot of childish bad blood about 20th century politics! (I know they've got Gore's daughter as a writer, but seriously. Get over it!)

I'm not going to say, like another reviewer, that I'll never buy anything Futurama does again because of this. Frankly, I'm gonna buy the next movie, too. But I'll sure be crossing my fingers that they return to the hilarity of the past. All they did with this episode is show us why Futurama got canned in the first place. And I assure you, I take no pleasure at all in that observation.",1196899200,11,1178,4.658653846153846
2927659,3,B000UZDO62,"I've watched all four seasons of Futurama from beginning to end something in the neighborhood of six times over the course of my life (though to be fair, at least one of those times was to watch the commentaries,) and there's a good reason I watched it.  Futurama was rich with both high and low humor.  Bender's world-famous catchphrase can be seen as low humor and nothing else, and yet they're not above jokes about quantum mechanics if they think they can get away with it.  Futurama's richness and diversity of jokes entitled it to a consistently enjoyable run on television.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for this movie.  From the unneccesary and un-funny role call at the start of the movie, to the endless nudity-semi-jokes and limited 3-and-a-half wall jokes, I'm afraid I just didn't find this movie to be funny.  The ""jokes"" are either holdovers from the series, or slight permutations of those jokes, or else are just not delivered with the right timing to make them funny.  In comedy, timing is everything.  I realize they have more time on their hands than usual, but dragging a joke out doesn't make it funnier.
To be fair, I laughed about a dozen times through the course of this movie, but it was hard to watch in the interrim.
To be fair, this movie has its strengths.  A few intense or surprising twists in the plot and some tragic inevitabilities and other things that turn the heads of sci-fi fans have turned up in this movie from time to time, which makes it feel like it was cut out to be an episode of the Twilight Zone with a slightly less serious flavor.  In fact, it's kind of a tear-jerker at points, and dramatically impressive for a short period of time, but I remembered Futurama (the show) for its humor, and humor and tragedy just don't mix.
I think what caused most of the pain for me with this movie was the villains.  Instead of using classic, proven villains like Lrrr or Mom for this movie, Futurama chose to invent a new alien race apparently called ""Scammers,"" (because, you see, they take over planets with internet scams.  God help us all if this style of naming alien races ever becomes more popular,) who act like a cross between packrats, computer nerds, and that bully who beat you up after school and bragged about it to the other students, his parents and teachers, and yet for some reason was never pushished for it.  Pretty much everything about these guys is unenjoyable to watch, from their persistent, hideous nudity, to their irritating tendency to get what they want throughout the main body of the movie, to their ""throbbing scrungers,"" (don't ask.)  But mostly what makes them horrible plot-wise is two things.  First, that their death scenes are so quick and unsatisfying, and secondly, that they never act even the slightest bit menacing, which would have given them at least a bit of credibility, as it does with Lrrr and Mom.  Then there's the fact that Bender spends over half the movie not really acting like Bender, and Bender is a large part of why people watched Futurama to begin with.  Throughout the course of this movie, he never once tells anyone to bite his shiny metal... you know...  Even though many character sorely ask for it.
In the end, my primary reason for not rating this DVD lower is the many wonderful extras.  The commentary on the movie is funnier than the movie itself, and the inclusion of ""Everybody loves Hypnotoad,"" ""A Futurama Math Lecture"" and ""A Terrifying Message from Al Gore,"" really helped me recover from just how lacking a movie this was.  Maybe the next time the futurama team tries to make a movie, they'll focus more on the jokes.  I hope, I hope, I hope.",1196899200,9,3668,4.639876352395673

2927663,4,B000UZDO62,"After several seasons of 'The Simpsons,' Matt Groening (with David X. Cohen) decided on creating a warped version of 'The Jetsons,' called 'Futurama.'

Basically it tells the story of a hapless delivery boy who inadvertently gets frozen for a thousand years, only to end up being a futuristic delivery boy in a world gone mad with Suicide Booths, Killer Santabots, Robots, One-eyed alien/mutant, and other oddities.

Regrettably, thanks to Fox pre-empting the series with Football and other strange programming, the show really never got the chance to shine like it's other counterpart did.  But as with 'Family Guy,' 'Futurama' survived in reruns thanks to CN's Adult Swim.

And now after so many months of reruns, the show returns in a Direct-to-DVD feature called, ""Bender's Big Score.""  Of course, the title is a bit misleading since as with most Futurama episodes, the real focus happens to be on Fry and Leela.

Primarily as an inside joke, the story begins with Prof. Farnsworth informing the Planet Express crew they have been fired for about two years by the Box Network. Ironically, just before the dejected employees go to clean out their desks, Farnsworth receives word the Box Network execs were fired and subtly transformed into Torgo's Executive Powder (a running gag since apparently the product has many uses throughout the film).

Due to this, Planet Express is back in business, but the celebration is short-lived when Hermes Conrad gets beheaded in a freak accident.  Thus the film really begins.

Amidst the classic jokes and such, the plot goes something like this, while making a delivery to the Nudist Beach Colony Planet, three aliens trick the crew members into giving out their private information.

This results in Prof. Farnsworth losing ownership of Planet Express to them as well as Bender becoming an unwilling slave to them.  Yet, apparently these aliens thrive off of information, as they get Bender to plunder the Planet Express secrets and later discover Fry's Bender Tattoo subtly contains the Universal Time Code.

Though it's a Paradox-Correcting Time Code, there are unforeseen complications, as the scammers discover, because you can go back to the Past using the code, but not return to the Present (and apparently you can't go into the Future, but I'm digressing).  Thus, Bender volunteers in helping the scammers plunder the riches of Earth History.  Meanwhile, the scammers keep up swindling people out of their valuables.

Mainly the rest of the film deals with Fry and Leela, where Leela meets a handsome new medical assistant, Lars, while Fry ends up escaping back to the 21st Century, where we see another version of him live between 2000-2012.

The one thing I liked about the film was how they allude to a lot of the classic moments from Past Episodes.  As well as keeping with some inside gags, if you can spot them (like Cartman inside the Head Museum).

Many purists may not like how the film runs because technically it's really a long episode with some of the classic Futurama characters and shticks we've seen before.  Consequently, being a Futurama fan, I liked 'Bender's Big Score,' mainly because at least Groening and Cohen are keeping the original formula of the series, and not attempting some modernized flavour unfamiliar to us.  As what CN has done to 'George of the Jungle.'

Primarily I feel this is Futurama at it's best, the wry humour is there, and a lot of characters from past episodes, like the Harlem Globetrotters, make appearances.  We also get to see some mysteries solved as well, like how Fry's dog got fossilized in the first place, as well as what really caused 'aliens' to decimate New York as well.

I won't spoil the ending for you, but I will say it does leave you wanting more, which is good ""Beast With a Million Backs,"" will be coming out soon, hopefully to give us more of the Planet Express crew and the hijinks of Futurama as well.",1196812800,,3923,4.91060606060606

2927665,5,B000UZDO62,"One should not be surprised by some of the negative reviews for this new Futurama full-length movie, because that's how hardcore fans behave. I'm one myself. The negative reviews are over-reacting to minor weaknesses that are certainly worthy of concern but aren't the end of the world. Some of the concerns are definitely legitimate, to be sure. The comedic timing is a bit off as compared to the original series, the dramatic scenes are overwrought at times, and the musical numbers are awkward (except for Coolio's rapping as Kwanzaa Bot). But hardcore fans who decide that they hate this new release due to those factors are sorely missing the forest for the trees. Everything else about this movie is still loveable, especially in comparison to all the other creations that have somehow survived on TV for much longer than the stupendously creative and intricately hysterical Futurama. Here we have the usual awesome space age animation, put to even greater effect in widescreen format, and the story is very cleverly written and hilariously fascinating (if a bit convoluted at times). While I would have liked to see more of Dr. Zoidberg, all the best primary and secondary characters of the Futurama universe make appearances here, there are great developments in the saga of Fry and Leela, and as usual Bender runs the show no matter which personality he's operating under.

Despite a few writing and production flaws (possibly just the result of being out of the game for a few years), I'm ecstatic that the Futurama team has gotten the chance to bring their unique universe and lovable characters back to life. Serious fans should not ignore the great opportunities offered by this film and its three upcoming counterparts. As for this DVD package, the extras are generally okay, but watch out in particular for the preposterously ridiculous full episode of ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad.""

The movie served as the long-awaited return for a show that was cancelled in its prime, but they made the plot too complex with not enough old-fashioned humor.  The reason everyone loved the show was because you sympathized with the characters, but in the movie they're all far too one-sided and only in scenes for split seconds before they move to another plot line.

It just seemed like the writers attempted to recreate the success and humor of the episodes ""Farnsworth Parabox"" and ""Roswell that Ends Well"" with the plot, but couldn't quite recapture the enjoyment.  I'm glad the shows back, but I'm hoping they can get the show back on track before those execs at the Box Network cancel them again.",1196812800,4,790,4.702898550724638

Unfortunately it's slapped together in a way that doesn't allow the humor to build in the same way that made many of the original episodes brilliant. As it is, this ""movie"" never becomes truly funny.  It's amusing at best.

I still think there will be good to come out of this though.  It's pretty clear that the writers had four ~20min episodes in mind and I have a feeling that this will partition up into pretty good ones at that.  It seems like it would be difficult to come up with a successful movie while going in with a ""we will break it up later"" mindset, and apparently it was.  I just hope that the episodes don't suffer because of it as well.

A few specific criticisms I have are (WARNING:  semi-spoilers below),
1) Too much time spent on ""We're back, take a look at this!"" material.  We know you're back.  All the character cameos that have nothing to do with advancing the plot are distracting.
2) Too many recycled sequences.  We've already seen an alien space battle above Earth and a Santa's workshop song and dance number.
3) Enough with the smooching of Al Gore's shiny rear end already.  Ok, it isn't that bad but I needed another criticism because 3 is my favorite number.

Overall, this is definitely worth buying for Futurama fans.  I have no idea how people who aren't familiar with the series would react.  Probably with utter confusion.",1196726400,,1438,4.498069498069498

The more I have watched it though the more I have caught nuances about the movie that changed my initial idea of the movie. There are a lot of references in the movie to other episodes that you wouldn't get unless you're very familiar with them, which may ruin it for some people, but overall it was a great flick.

It was wonderful seeing all of the old characters, and they left no cameo appearance untouched.  (I even found myself checking to make sure that no character from the series was left out of the movie.)  It was a great bit of nostalgia for old fans of the show and yet still offered a fresh introduction to new viewers.  And the way they so cleverly threw in scenes/explanations from the old series (Fry in the cryogenics lab while the world was being destroyed by spaceships; Fry's fossilized dog) without disrupting the continuity of the movie was brilliant and nothing less than I expected from these writers.

On a side note, without hopefully giving too much away -- there were two sentimental episodes of the series that always left me in tears: Fry's dog being left alone to wait for a master who would never return, and Fry's brother Yancy mourning his missing brother and naming his son after him.  This movie addressed both of those situations, and I couldn't have been more thrilled.

Every aspect of the television show you loved was artfully blended into this movie -- from the singing Christmas carols to the bittersweet romance/non-romance of Fry and Leela.

Classic words, uttered numerous times by Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth throughout the series.

If you were a fan or enjoyed the series during its run, then these words ring true to you.

This was yet another victim of the clowns at Fox. Nah, I guess I'm being too unkind. To clowns that is...

Like The Family Guy, Futurama is back from the dead. Unlike the family guy, Futurama isn't returning to prime time TV as a regular series. Instead we're treated to a series of movies, with its first of a probable four set of direct to DVD feature length movies.

I say four movies because that's the rumour I've seen in numerous spots online.

After more than two years of not being able to enjoy this quirky but funny series, it was a great pleasure for me to pick up the first movie: Bender's big Score.

All the regular characters are back - Fry, Zoidberg, Leela, Amy, Hermes, Bender, Farnsworth, plus many of the regulars that you've seen throughout the show's run on TV.

Many `classic' supporting characters are in it as well. Such as Zapp Brannigan, Nibbler, the Robot Mafia, Robot Santa, and everyone's favourite Hypnotoad!- just to name a few.

With the internet the way it is, scammers and Phishers are in their glory today. They prey on the ill-informed and the greedy, and have been able to bilk many unsuspecting victims out of a fortune in cash.

To be brief, and without giving away too many spoilers, that's the entire premise of the movie. Scammers end up first taking over Planet Express and eventually end up owning every single valuable item on Earth.

Thanks to Bender's love of internet Robot porn, a mysterious tattoo that somehow managed to end up on Fry's derriere, and time travel.

I really enjoyed watching the movie, and seeing all the characters back, true in form. There was no deviation from the way they acted in the series, and, if I'm not mistaken, all the original voice actors were back to reprise their roles.

As I stated before, it was good to see the return of what became iconic figures in the series, such as the Robot Mafia and Robot Santa. Even Fry's faithful dog made several  appearances.

The animation was a little better than the series, simply because the producers had a bigger budget to work with (again, that's pure speculation, but it's an educated speculation), and a lot more use of computer animation, especially for the battle.

You're enjoyment will not end with the rolling of the credits though. Be sure to watch the various Bonus features, including 3 never filmed story boards, a live comic book reading by the cast, a full length episode of the Hypnotoad show (yes, it's an actual 22 minute episode, I'm not kidding!) and several other bonus features.

I watched them all, but I won't give away anything, as it would spoil it for you.

For fans, it's a must. There are a lot of subtle references to past shows throughout the movie.

For those who want something new, it's worth watching as a stand alone feature film, but it's a shame that a lot of the visual humour will be lost on the un-initiated.

To the geek fans like me out there: watch the movie, watch it again, and then watch the movie with commentary.  It is fantastic.  Thank your God that someone allowed Futurama to return.  The movie is a continuation of the series, in every sense.  The comedy, the intelligence, and the many odes to sci-fi of the past.  I love this show, and I love this movie.

For balance, I will offer criticism: I could do without the musical pieces.  Mom did not make an appearance.  And there could have been more Zapp. And who was the original source of the tattoo?  But... those critiques are inconsequential.  What matters is that we get more Futurama.

I was really looking forward to Futurama comeback and preordered the movie 2 months before the release (along with the Futurama 2008 calendar, which, btw. is nice).

The movie was rather disappointing, most jokes were of the type, where you realize it is a joke, but that's about it. Unstoppable bursts of laughter I experienced watching the series just weren't there. My wife, who started watching with me and likes Futurama too, left in the middle because she got bored.

I suspect that creators had a lot of fun, for example getting back at FOX for canceling the series, but as it is often with such things, when creators of the comedy have too much fun, viewers often don't. In the series, the jokes were often surprising and wonderfully cruel, here, most of them were painfully obvious, old or, in some cases, carried 'a message'.

The plot is pretty complex, even for a Futurama episode.  Some may feel that for a comedy the plot is too confusing with the use of time travel throughout, but that's what Futurama has always done best in my opinion.  Incorporating those sci-fi elements into it is what makes it so great, and I'm always happy to see time travel elements being utilized for a show like this, giving it an epic feel.

The fact that they were able to make this happen, getting the creators and actors all back together shows just how dedicated they are to this show and the fans.  What's even better is that this is just the 1st of 4 straight-to-DVD Futurama movies, the rest of which are getting released next year.  If there's anything negative I can say about it, its that there are not one, but 2 songs in it that I could have done without.  Musical numbers might work OK on Simpsons, but felt really out of place here and were not enjoyable.

One last thing.  Matt Groening had this to say at the Con in San Diego last summer.  Comedy Central has acquired the rights to air Futurama reruns and when it returns, these movies will be split up into 3 episodes each giving us 12 new episodes.  He teased the audience saying that depending on how good the ratings are for the new eps, and how well the DVDs sell, that Futurama might be in line for a Family Guy style revival.  Now, who knows, he could have just been saying this to get fans' hopes up and sell a few more copies of the movies, but that would be great if it were to happen.

The songs are in my opinion horribly, cringe-worthy lame... I tolerated the singing in the episode where they went to Robot Hell pretty well, but this time, I winced. Some of the alien machinations seem kind of just there to push the plot forward, but this is nothing new for Futurama or it's cousin The Simpsons, whose movie I was a little less enchanted with on the whole earlier this year. To be frank, I don't think the movie format fits either the Simpsons or Futurama.

It is not simply 4 sub-par episodes loosely tied together like ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story."" The writers have pulled off a brilliant plot filled with original jokes, humor and emotion; characteristics that made the show stand out in the first place.

I can only imagine the people giving this movie less than 4 stars are not die-hard fans and don't care for some of the original episodes, but wanted this to be miraculously better. If you're one of these people I wouldn't waste your money.

2927695,3,B000UZDO62,"In my humble opionion, the original four seasons of Futurama were consistently some of the funniest TV shows ever made, animated or otherwise. All the irreverent wit of The Simpsons, but with more adult themes and a whole universe to make fun of. Fantastic!

It was a tragedy that the show was canceled before its time, so I was delighted to hear about this comeback movie, and immediately pre-ordered it.

Unfortunately though, the movie does not live up to the standard of excellence set by the original episodes. Where the original episodes were neatly packaged gems, each exploring or parodying some new idea or character, this movie simply comes across as a manic mish-mash of ideas and characters from the earlier episodes. Hardly a single character from the original four seasons fails to make a 30 second appearance here. This has several effects. Firstly, each character's brief appearance means that none of the characters are introduced properly - if you haven't seen the corresponding original episode you'll have no idea why the Harlem Globe Trotters suddenly turn up, for example. Second, it means that most of the character jokes are things we've seen before, and they're just less funny the second time round. Finally, the constant parade of character cameos destroys the flow of the movie and makes it rather chaotic. How they're going to break this into smaller episodes and expect non-fans to make sense of it is a mystery to me.

In addition, the new story just isn't one of the better ones - it's kinda slow, and the dialog lacks sparkle. Perhaps if the writers hadn't been trying to cram in every possible conceivable reference to the original episodes they might have had time to come up with some better material for the new stuff.

I've given this 3 stars because I love Futurama and I want it to succeed. But I'm hoping that the next movie will be a significant improvement.",1196294400,9,1900,4.836923076923077

After the show's hiatus, I doubt that the writers have merely used up all their good material or fallen into the Simpson's trap of self-referentialism (as one reviewer put it). Bender's Big Score is essentially a reintroduction of all the character's that fans--die hard or not--are sure to remember from the previous four seasons. Intertwined throughout is a fairly complex time travel story that entertains from beginning to end. I'll be the first to admit that I have rarely just exploded with laugh-out-loud outbursts from ever watching Futurama, and it is my all time favorite show nonetheless. It's not necessarily about busting a gut, but in my opinion about keeping up with the characters and trying to understand all their obscure references. I practically feel smarter after watching Futurama. And in Bender's Big Score, it's almost a game to remember past episodes and whether or not the new time travel theme meshes with old stories (pay close attention to the Jurassic Bark reference). So before you go writing off the new Futurama, remember there are still three more movies yet to come, and I'm sure the writers have jokes and material that they would've loved to use in the first movie, but would obviously not have pertained to the plot.",1196294400,,1348,4.942731277533039

Nevermind.

Futurama as a series was one of a kind.  A step beyond 'The Simpsons' in many ways.  Created by Matt Groening and David X. Cohen, they developed the humor of the former and pumped it up a notch.  Not only was the humour a bit more risque, but a tad more dignified in many ways.

With an opening briefly summerizing, in thinly veiled jabs at the Fox Network, the audience is treated to the return of the Futurama gang.  From the get-go, the crew is on top of their game.  It's as if they never left.

The gang decides to visit an all nude planet for a little get away.  While there, a group of pinkish, disgusting aliens scam each and everyone of them out of their personal information.

Shortly after arriving back to their beloved Planet Express, the Futurama family realizes the aliens have taken their lives over.  By sheer organic instinct, the aliens discover a secret code on Fry's butt that opens a time portal.  Bender, under the aliens command due to a virus, volunteers to steal all of the worlds greatest treasures thereby making the aliens rich beyond imagination.

Afterwards, chaos and confusion ensue.  Fry's fear and depression sends him through the time warp to when he first was frozen chryogenically.

From there, the plot grows confusing.  As does most 'time travel' based stories when the amount of twists and turns pile up.

Overall, as one of the few Futurama fans I know (nobody else in my immediate family cared for the show,) I must say I found the movie to be a hilarious addition to the long, tragically underappreciated show.  Every character the cult audience has loved through the history is present in one way or another.

It may be true, some characters such as Kif or Brannigan, or any alien from Persei Omicron 8 doesn't have a large role in the film.  However, keep in mind, this is the first of four movies coming to DVD featuring the Futurama cast.

Guest stars as varied as both Sarah Silverman and Al Gore make funny cameos here and there.

As the movie buff I am, I watched the movie once.  After that, I watched the film with the wonderfully hilarious commentary featuring not only the writer and director along with the creators.  Also most of the cast.  The brilliant chemistry between John DiMagio and Billy West is obvious and addictive.

My theory on the reason for the confusing time travel plot is simply this: So you watch it more than once for things you may have missed.

The picture is brilliant, the animation is beautiful.  The special featurs are second to none.  There's even a lecture featuring a Mathematician who explains the many mathematical jokes sprinkled in the movie.  Another special feature is a reading of a comicbook story based upon the return of 'Futurama.'

My wish for the next films: More of the same!  The only change I would make is this: One commentary with the entire main cast.  Katey Segal hasn't been on one!  I'd love to hear her chemistry with the rest.

Needless to say, I recommend this movie to any fan of great humor and of course, Futurama.",1196294400,,3098,4.640883977900552
2927701,5,B000UZDO62,I really was excited when they were going to be making more of this series. Its a great show and this feature length show was also very good. The only draw back of buying this is that the case it comes in really sucks. I'm affrad of scratching the dvd. Its just in a card board sleave. Other than that its a great buy.,1196294400,3,318,3.984375
2927702,4,B000UZDO62,"Pros:

+ More Futurama!

+ A great twist ending.

Cons:

- Too much self referencing

- Not as funny as some of the better episodes.

Futurama: Bender's Big Score certainly isn't a disappointment.  All the old gang is back, discovering the secret to time travel, and there are some great jokes as always.  The twist ending is truly great and is reminiscent of some of the better plotted episodes in the series such as ""The Sting"".

I do think, however, that there was a little too much self-referencing, especially with the jokes, and the creators were a little too eager to stick in all the minor characters that they could.  This certainly wouldn't be what you would want to show someone to introduce them to the series.  You would also expect that they would want to come in with a bang after being cancelled and all, but there are probably about a dozen episodes of the show that are better than this.

Still, even average Futurama fare, packed into a full length film spells goodness.",1196294400,,989,4.588571428571429

2927704,4,B000UZDO62,"While still among one of the greatest Futurama's made, it's hade to compete with some of the classic old episodes, such as the globetrotter episode and Roswell. However as a standalone 'movie' it's hilarious, well worth the money and I'll still probably watch it religiously. The beginning is by far the funniest part of the movie, and references to past episodes praise long-time viewers. Although, some of the jokes are a bit out of Futurama's style, and the antagonists aren't very entertaining, but besides that this is a great buy and I can't wait for the next DVD to come out.",1196294400,,582,4.772277227722772
2927705,5,B000UZDO62,"Being a diehard Futurama fan, even a subpar movie would win me over. Luckily I got to experience what is 'Bender's Big Score'. It takes about twenty minutes for the movie to kick into hard drive, but once it does, it's like enjoying the original tv show episodes of this series, or 'Star Trek' for the first time (or the second, third or so-on if your a dialogue and freeze frame geek like myself). It has a lot of characters from old episodes giving brief appearences such as the computeresque god from 'godfellas' down to (in height anyways) Philip J Fry (Fry's nephew) from 'the luck of the fryrish'. If you like intelligent comedy you will like this. If you like sci-fi and you are into intelligent comedy you will simply love this. So sit down, get a 40 of some 'Olde Fortran Malt Liquor' and watch this movie, you will most definitely enjoy it.",1196208000,,850,4.490322580645161
2927706,5,B000UZDO62,"I instantly became giddy when I saw the UPS man pull up to the house with the package today.  I knew that small envelope contained the first new Futurama I would get to watch in two long Bender-less years.

The packaging is great.  The hologram of Bender belching as Fry, Leela, Hermes' Head and Dr Zoidberg cower in fear is still making me giggle as I write this.

We actually started with a special feature.  They produced an actual full length episode of ""Everybody Love Hypnotoad.""  I have to say, Master Hypnotoad is the greatest thing ever put on a DVD.  In fact, they should release another DVD with nothing but the glorious and wise Hypnotoad.

After we broke free from our benevolent amphibious lord's gaze, we started the feature.

Bender's Big Score begins with the crew being fired because they had been canceled by the Box Corporation two years ago and no one had bothered to tell them.  The numerous insults and jabs thrown at Fox were welcomed and well placed, as was Hermes Conrad's unfortunate decapitation.

The story is simple, and classic Futurama.  People are essentially stupid, and all of earth falls victim to numerous cheesy fishing scams run by three evil space nudists.  It is soon discovered that Fry has the secret code to unlock time travel tattooed  on his buttock.  Bender, who is under the control of the evil space nudists is then sent back in time to steal for them, even though each trip threatens to rip the fabric of space-time asunder.

Every character from Futurama makes an appearance in this flick with the exception of the back water asteroid space chicken.  There is even a musical number performed by Santa, Hanukah Zombie, and Kwanzaa-bot.

A great movie filled with humor and even the moving emotional scenes that we have come to expect from this great series.  Along the way, many of the mysteries of the original four seasons are answered, and new mysteries are brought to the fore.

I am a huge Futurama fan, and this was more than I could have expected out of a Futurama movie.  Al Gore was hilarious as always.  For those of you that are not fans of the series, I think the humor is wild enough to tickle even your funny bone, so give it a try.  This is a five star buyer for me.  I will be rewatching it often.  By the way, the Terrifying Message from Al Gore special feature is hilarious, but I would expect nothing less from the Emperor of the Moon.",1196208000,,2404,4.5607476635514015
2927707,1,B000UZDO62,"Futurama is quite possibly my favorite cartoon, maybe even my favorite 30 minute comedy show of any sort, of all time. It's clever, sweet, and smart in ways that few other shows ever manage. It's a disappointment, then, that this rebirth of the show is such a dud. I've had some trepidation since these projects were announced because Futurama ended on such a good note. As such, my expectations weren't exceedingly high. Sadly, even that couldn't make this look good. ""Bender's Big Score"" is essentially a quagmire of self referentialism disguised as humor. 80% of the ""jokes"" are basically ""hey, remember this character from the show?"" Virtually every side character that's ever been in a Futurama makes its way in here, most of them to absolutely no purpose and no laughs. It's essentially a magnified version of the trap the Simpsons has fallen into in its later seasons, which I suppose makes sense considering the creators.

Regardless, the most surprising thing about this is that after years of cancellation, the makers of Futurama really don't seem to have anything else funny to say or do with these characters. Ah well, at least we have the originals on DVD to enjoy. Do yourself a favor and take the time you'd have spent watching this to rewatch your favorite episodes, you'll have a much better time.",1196208000,32,1314,4.866071428571429
2927708,5,B000UZDO62,"I am a huge fan of Futurama. I'm one of those people that have been watching the same episodes over and over on DVD for the past few years. So I immediately purchased this DVD the moment it was released. I've watched it three times since then, and I've come to the conclusion that I liked it!  I have to emphasize that the plot is very complex and I worry that people new to the series would miss out on a lot and maybe have a bit of trouble following the plot. I personally love time travel though so I think this plot is fantastic.

I agree with a lot of other reviews that the comedy from the TV shows is somewhat lacking in this movie, but I think the magnificent plot more than makes up for it. It seems that the writers wanted to focus more on a plot then the traditional comedy. A movie needs to have a more complex plot then a TV episodes, so I don't see the problem. I may not have laughed out loud, but I was fascinated and intrigued throughout the movie.

Any die hard fan of the series will want to pickup this movie to add the their DVD collection. I suggest those new to Futurama to watch the TV episodes first before watching the movie. The movie will mean a lot more and make more sense if you've seen the TV episodes first.

I'm certainly looking forward to the other movies. The commentary with the DVD says that the other movies have a much less complex plot, so perhaps that will have comedy similar to the TV episodes and make these other reviewers happy. I'm just happy Futurama is back and I hope you are too!",1196208000,2,1532,4.183050847457627
2927709,4,B000UZDO62,"I'm a big fan of Futurama, so when Bender's Big Score came out this Tuesday I didn't waste a second and ran to the nearest Blockbuster to get it. Bender's Big Score is a great movie, but in my opinion the movie is a disappointment when compared to the old Futurama TV episodes. Understandable: a movie has limited time, and believe me there is *a lot* going on in Bender's Big Score! Some of the major and funniest characters (Zapp and Kif for instance) were barely shown. Most importantly, I feel that the funny scenes in the movie were ""rushed up"" in an attempt to fit the story in a DVD movie. I really wish they had made another series of episodes instead of a single movie.",1196208000,,678,4.346456692913386
2927710,2,B000UZDO62,"To start off with, I'm a huge Futurama fan.  I've seen every episode at least 5 times.  I've been looking forward to its return for years.  I didn't just want to like this movie, I wanted to love it.
But through the whole thing, all I kept thinking was ""When's the funny part?""

It reminded me a lot of the last episode of Seinfeld, where they tried to bring in every minor character and rehash every joke the series ever did for no reason.  I understand the writers trying to throw in a few nods to past episodes, but the cameos just felt forced.

In fact, pretty much everything about this DVD felt forced.  The jokes, which were mostly crude and completely lacked the wit of the original series.  Even the title doesn't really feel appropriate to the movie; you can just picture some marketing team deciding to use Bender's name in the title, since ""the kids all love Bender so much"" even though he probably had the least amount of face time and story of the main characters.  The stories were just variations on or expansions of jokes from previous episodes, too.  And the ""twist ending"" was painfully obvious way before it was revealed.

From the opening, I couldn't believe they started off by introducing the characters, as if the people who'd be snatching this DVD up would all be new to the series, and it just went downhill from there.  Every single Futurama episode, from the decent to the best, all had at least one or two absolutely classic lines you'd be repeating to your friends for days.  I can't even think of a single memorable quote or joke from this movie.

I do have to say, though, it was good to see the gang all back and in widescreen format now.  All I can hope is that the writers have now gotten this out of their system and we can look forward to a return to the good old Futurama for the next DVD.",1196208000,18,1827,4.379821958456973

All of the original characters have returned as well as some favorite guests/characters from the show.  There are LOTS of flashbacks, so having the DVD will be fun re-watching all the things I missed during the screening.

The movie doesn't have the same creative spark that most episodes of the TV series did.  The plot is great and leads to some funny situations, but the little inserts of humor were often unimaginative and dropped too often into stale toilet humor.  Even the songs were mediocre.  Between the 5 of us watching, there were very few laugh-out-loud moments, and the chuckles were not nearly as frequent as in the TV series.  I think we got more laughs out of the Everybody Loves Hypnotoad special feature than the movie itself.

Aliens are out to scam and steal everything they can, and with a time traveling bender helping them (semi-unwittingly), they may just succeed in walking away with all the world's treasure.  The crew at Planet Express are the only ones who can stop the aliens.

The art work and voice acting are the same as they were for the show, so if you liked it before, you will probably enjoy it this time around.  The plot is intelligent and clever, and the writers make great use of time travel paradox gimic in the writing.  You will want to watch it twice just so you can pick up the little jokes you may have missed the first time, and you will probably enjoy the second viewing as much as the first (if not more).

There are no advances to the movie from the series.  No boundries are broken.  Nothing is being done with this movie that hasn't been done before with the show.  But seeing as how the show was canceled prematurely anyway, most people will be okay with the fact that no new ground was broken.

bottom line... if you love futurama, you must buy this.  you will love it and watch it over and over (like you still watch the episodes).  don't think twice and let these guys fill your head with nonsense.  you know it's great and you want it, so go get it and enjoy it and tell them to bite your shiny metal... well, you know.",1196121600,4,792,4.19205298013245

2927719,4,B000UZDO62,"I am not insulting Robert Zemeckis when I call him the absolute master of eye candy. He knows how to direct so that the audience doesn't have to think at all. This is paricularly true in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. You always know exactly what's going on, and where & when you are in the story.

""Bender's Big Score"" is a horribly complex time-travel story. It is _so_ complex that the characters and jokes almost vanish under the complexity. I found myself more often exasperated than entertained. Zemeckis could likely have done a better job.

There _are_ some fine scenes, though, particularly one in which we learn the real reason Al Gore lost in Florida. And Al Gore appears as himself; it's nice to see a politician who's willing to poke fun at his image. And there's a surprise revelation about one of the characters that should make most viewers happy.

By the way, ""Torgo's Powder"" appears to be a reference to Torgo, a weird character in one of the worst films ever made, ""Manos -- the Hands of Fate"". Perhaps we'll learn more in the future (ouch).

Though ""Bender's Big Score"" has a few funny moments, there aren't enough of them. ""BBS"" appears to be more of a set-up for the following films, ending as it does with Something Terrible About To Happen. If you're not familiar with ""Futurama"", this film is _not_ a good place to start. You'd be better off watching the series from the start.

ADDENDUM: I just finished watching BBS a second time. Not being distracted by the time-travel plot, I found the film much more amusing. And the plotting _does_ make sense, though it has the same logical inconsistency as ST2 and ST4: [Plot Spoiler] Once Bender removes the tattoo from Lars's buttocks and puts it on Fry's, the tattoo enters a temporal loop in which it always exists but was never created, just like the frames for Kirk's glasses.",1196121600,4,1853,4.637195121951219

Interestingly enough, I got my wish but only for the last quarter of the movie.  It suddenly 'ramped up' and the writing got tighter and much funnier.

The jokes tend to be more vulgar than they were before but that doesn't get in the way of the geeky humor that really defines Futurama. The only thing really wrong with it is the twist-filled time-travelling plot. It got really ridiculous. And the final twist at the end involving a new character was not the slightest bit surprising. I think everyone will see it coming no more than twenty minutes into the movie. But that's my only issue. Everything else is top-notch.

2927734,5,B000UZDO62,"It's impossible to make a time travel story without confusion. Since it can't be avoided, Futurama: Bender's Big Score celebrates it.

While the title is a bit misleading (Bender commits some fine thefts, but it's a bit of a footnote), this deliciously convoluted new feature-length works to catch you up on everything you missed during Futurama's long absence.

The 10-second recap:
Fry has the secret to time travel tattooed on his buttock. Bender's mind is taken over by thieves. Time-traveling-thieving chaos ensues.

The feature stands well against the four seasons that preceded it. Cut into episodes (which I believe it was destined to be), the humor and storytelling will fit in nicely with the rest of the series. It's not a mind-blowing epic that you'd expect from a theatrical release. Instead, it's a wonderful homecoming for a series that's been missed for far too long. Look for, more or less, a GREAT episode times four.

For those of you who've been passing the time memorizing what's available, you'll be richly rewarded. More fan service per minute than anything I've seen in a while. DOZENS of references to previous episodes, and better still, explanations and expansions of older gags (thanks to the time travel bits).

1. Humor was strong, very strong, but not enough to carry a ""movie.""  It was a ""to be continued"" finish which felt rushed and unsatisfactory.
2. Loose ends from the series - tied up. . . kinda.  Won't ruin it, but... but... it made me look at multiple events in the Futurama universe in a different light.  Most importantly was the dog, Seymour.  I... just can't ruin it.  There were more tears shed for Seymour, which would be the most I have ever shed for an animated character.
3. Cameos actually made sense to me, unlike prior review.  Except the kids.  Time travel may explain their resurrection (oops, spoiler?) but still... they could have been a stronger presence.

All in all, I love that Futurama is back, and 90 minutes per episode is better than ... cancellation.  But they can do better.

No, nevermind.  I saw ""The Simpsons Movie.""  That SHOULD have been direct-to-video.  I would give this a 4 1/2 stars simply for the fact that they realized it was NOT theater worthy.  But still a worth-while DVD purchase.  Get to it people, I can't wait for the continuation!",1195689600,9,1158,4.598039215686274
2927736,5,B000UZDO62,"This marks the first of several Futurama ""movies"" to be released, and the return of the series after years of (unjust) cancellation. Like most ""movies"" from the animated comedy genre it is essentially just a long episode(to be split into the appropriate time segments upon future broadcast). Having said that however, it is one damn good episode. They pulled out all the stops for this release, bringing back virtually every supporting character from throughout the series in a huge display of fan service that was handled nicely. The only disappointment is the lack of John Goodman reprising his original voicing of Robot Santa, using instead the John DiMaggio rendition from later episodes with him. Mark Hamill doing the never before seen(only referenced) Chanukah Zombie does make up for it a bit though.

Rest assured, anyone who enjoyed the series in the slightest will love Bender's Big Score, and won't be let down. It might not win over people who weren't fans to begin with, but then people who don't like Futurama are terrible, terrible people anyway.",1195603200,,1062,5.034090909090909
2927737,5,B000UZDO62,"Its great to see this wonderful show back in some form. All new and hilarious. If you are a fan of simpson's, family guy, american dad or especially futurama, this is a must buy. I won't spill story details, but its just as zaney as the tv show. Can't wait for the follow-up dvds.",1195516800,,280,4.203703703703703
2927738,4,B000UZDO62,"Just got a chance to see this thanks to a friend in the dying newspaper industry who had the joyous task of reviewing it. It's nice to have friends.

The movie is hilarious. The jokes are fast and furious. Expect the classic Futurama experience -- visual gags, great one-liners, and a ludicrous plot.

Not all of the characters get a chance to shine (Zapp only appears briefly; Zoidberg is background and unfortunately Hermes gets more screentime than even the Professor). But any screentime is good for a show that has been off the air for so long (and the reruns don't count in my world!)

There are 2 great songs, one that is introduced in the most forced way possible. The other is sprung without warning.

The plot is crazy and I won't ruin it here. Suffice it to say it involves time travel and a number of familiar cameos from season's past (Globetrotters, Santa, and, yes, Al Gore).

The title is really just trying to exploint Bender's popularity. The ""score"" is not really ""his"" -- [the following is known early in the film, but you might call it a small spoiler]: he's just a tool of the scamming aliens that end up controlling earth.

But the real story is Fry and Leela -- and while it works, the movie doesn't handle it that well. Plus, it's not any better than the final episode of the series itself (which was more heartfelt.) The storyline ends up jumping back and forth between 3007 and a span of 12 years from 2000-2012 where a version of Fry is living. the jumps are a bit much and the stuff in the past is not nearly as funny as the stuff in the present. Finally, there is a plot twist that is blatantly obvious, even though the revelation of the twist is pretty funny.

I'm not complaining -- there are enough laughs to keep the thing moving right along. And if this is the first of 3 more great offerings, then I will be pleased.",1195171200,59,1852,4.413489736070381

2927740,5,B000UZDO62,"According to the August 6, 2007 V.B. Magazine, Fox is resurrecting canceled TV Series Futurama on DVD. The studio is scheduled to release four made-for-dvd full length films extending the animated series. The first, Futurama: Bender's Big Score, will debut on Nov 27. The new movies will represent the first new Futurama content since 2003. Bender's Big Score features the Futurama characters fighting nudist alien Internet scammers in order to save the planet Earth. Notable guest stars include Al Gore, Coolie and Sarah Silverman. Fox has slated the remaining three Futurama films for 2008.

Addendum January 6th, 2008: I bought the movie. I am sad to say that I was disappointed. You would think by now that they would have sufficient time to come up with a good script instead of rehashing the Simpson's formula of obscenities and nudity. I would have to downgrade my rating to 3 stars. I did enjoy the extras and the film was mildly entertaining. Think twice before purchasing and then forget that and just go rent it. We can only hope the other releases will be an improvement.",1193184000,16,1083,4.885869565217392

This is a playable disc, so that's all good, but the packaging is terrible and begins to ruin the disc as soon as you slide it out the first time. Scratches appear quickly. You will need to buy another case to hold this or ANY Futurama discs in this packaging if you want to keep it in playable condition. All the Futurama ""Volumes"" , NOT Seasons, and all these movies seem to be packaged in this shoddy cardboard. I love this show and got all of them for Christmas this year. Very disappointed overall in the throw away packaging and Asian origin. They have a feel of Black Market rip off to me, but for $5 worth it I guess. That's what I thought when I bought that Rolex on the street anyhow.",1451433600,,764,4.275862068965517
