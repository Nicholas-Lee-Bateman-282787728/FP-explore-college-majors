7826823,5,6302479290,"I love this movie for several reasons:  I enjoyed the setting and the mood, the old cars and their attire. It was great when Cybil began to care about the kidnapped little boy and began to regret that she was a part of the kidnapping.  I also enjoyed it because two people played in the movie from Memphis Tenn., Cybil herself and my father, Oliver Harris.  He was the old Black man sitting on the grocery store porch, smoking a cigarette, when Cybil and her male friends drove up to purchase a newspaper, at the very beginning of the picture.  That was the highlight of my father's life, making the movie and meeting Cybil and the other cast members.  So of course this is the greatest movie I will ever watch, no matter what.",990662400,3,727,4.395522388059701
