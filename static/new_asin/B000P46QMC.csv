8188844,5,B000P46QMC,This CD was well put together. I use it every time I host a use of force class.,1247529600,,79,3.4444444444444446
8188845,2,B000P46QMC,"The film is overhyped. The actual relieving of the siege was one of the most extraordinary special forces actions ever, yet the film fails to put this across in an effective way. Too many talking heads talking about the wrong things (feelings rather than operational detail) and a noteable lack of the promised unique footage.
I practically fell asleep while watching it although I did see it right through in the hope of something special that never actually came.
Not worth buying - if interested, there's probably a book on the subject.",1197504000,3,539,4.869565217391305
