As it turns out, this is an Indigo Entertainment release, from 2001--not one from the later-arriving MRG library, nearly all of which are no better than average (some downright bad). If you've seen Indigo Entertainment releases previously, you know what to expect: hot girls, copious explicit nudity, great production values, plots and acting that aren't too distracting. So already you know that you have something worth watching.

Roughly two minutes into it, when you see one actress spread her legs wide in full view of the camera, and her screenmate begin licking the area that you wish that you were licking, you know that this is beyond just good.

In short, ""Hollywood's Hidden Lives"" is either the most explicit soft-core movie that I've ever seen, or  the least-explicit hard-core one...either way, it's wall-rattling fantastic.

The plot, which takes a little while to find its footing, involves a movie-producing couple (Angela Davies and Brad Bartram--he who seems to have been born for roles like this one) who get their kicks by renting out their guest house and spying on their renters' sexual antics. Enter small-town Madelyne (fever-inducing Kimber Lynn) and writer David (Evan Kennsington), who meet on the street when each of them needs housing. They pretend to be married in order to move into the rental, and off we go.

I can't adequately describe how hot that Lynn is, even though she clearly is no stranger to the surgeon's knife and I typically like all-natural women. She shows everything, multiple times, and is very enthusiastic in her multiple sex scenes which run the gamut (solo, boy-girl, girl-girl). I love it that this movie has several gratuitous shower/bath scenes, which is something that is sorely missing in more recent erotica. The pneumatic Lynn is perfectly-suited for these.

The nudity is bountiful, the sex scenes great and on par with the best that Indigo ever produced--very very explicit, skirting closer to the edge of hard-core than I ever really thought possible. Many attractive women, many scenes, and the audio will knock your socks off. I've never seen another soft-core movie with such filthy, filthy language.

If you like this genre, you like me should find this to be one of the best examples ever made.",1380844800,,2420,4.9727722772277225
