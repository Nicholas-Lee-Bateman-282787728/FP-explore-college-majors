8518077,5,B007IX2M9O,"I work at a treatment facility and show this video regularly.  It is a powerful and easy to follow explanation of the 12 steps for anyone no matter what your addiction!!!!  We use it mostly for drug addicts and alcoholics, but we have people from Alanon and Overeaters anonymous find it equally as healpful.  This video points to a time when 12 step programs had a 50-75% recovery rate. We need to go back to the way the founders of AA worked the steps to catch more people from falling through the cracks of meetings.  The program of recovery is working the steps and this video shows you how.  Wally P is an AA archivist and historian who has interviewed old timers and has brought us back to the basics that work.  Addiction is a killer and this is an antedote!!  I hope you buy this life saving tool and spread the word that recovery works.  I thank Wally each day for this process.",1334966400,,886,4.359756097560975
8518078,5,B007IX2M9O,"When I first learned about doing the steps I felt terrified and stuck. It simply did not seem possible for me to do them as they are often taught these days... too complicated, too painful.

Fortunately, then I found Back to Basics. I started using the Back to Basics way of doing the steps several years ago and still use it on a daily basis. It helps me to cut through my self centeredness and addictive behaviors. It helps me to find peace. It helps me to live sanely and honestly. This DVD is not a short cut but it is doable. It is powerful. It teaches all of the essentials. It's based on the way the early pioneers of the 12 step movement actually took the steps.",1332288000,,670,4.234375
8518079,5,B007IX2M9O,"What a wonderful explanation of the 12 Steps of Recovery!  I love audio tapes and DVDs about recovery and the stories of hope and healing but I have never run across such a clear presentation of the 12 Steps.  What the presenter Wally P. does is just outstanding!  He took me through the Steps using passages from the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.  I even did an inventory!

This has really shown me the simplicity of the 12 Steps and is going to be a significant aid as I take others through the process too.  I work at a treatment center and we ordered multiple copies to show our clients.  I am so grateful for the reminder of the simplicity of the 12 Steps as the original program of recovery.  Thank you Wally!",1331683200,,719,4.353383458646617
8518080,5,B007IX2M9O,"When I came into recovery, my program did not have many options for doing the Steps. I was told to find a sponsor and work the Steps. Frankly, that wasn't much help. Members I talked with spoke of how they had been in program for years and still had not finished the steps. One well-meaning soul gave me a pamphlet with instructions to write the Steps one by one--however, it had over 12 pages of single-spaced questions to be answered just for Step 4, in addition to writing a full and complete life history! I knew that was not going to happen; I'd die before I finished! I continued to attend meetings and started feeling a little better but knew that I needed to do the Step work to truly recover. Then a friend called and said he had just been through a program where he did the Steps all in one day. I scoffed. Not possible! I didn't believe it. He just said I had to try it to see what it's like. And that's when I took my first live Back to Basics workshop. I did the Steps all in one day and had the spiritual experience recovery promises. Moreover, I watched over one hundred others do so as well that very day. My life transformed, finally. After years of trying and failing every kind of spiritual program to get recovery, the simple beauty of taking the Steps in the same way the original members of AA did produced the same results for me as it did for them. I've taken Back to Basics many times now and have worked the Steps in other ways as well. In the DVD set here, Wally P lays out the program of recovery so that anyone who has the capacity to be honest with themselves can have that same experience that millions of others have, around the world. I know; I am one of them!",1331424000,,1693,4.228395061728395
8518081,5,B007IX2M9O,"I went to 12 step meetings for years and was never able to stay sober until I was taken through Back to Basics. This is the way Dr. Bob and the founders intended the steps to be taken. I probably never would have recovered, just not drinking and going to meetings. I am now enjoying my 8th year clean and sober. All the steps are outlined clearly, directly from the Big Book. Finally all of what worked so well in the original, simple 12 step program is restored. Thank you.",1331337600,,474,4.277777777777778
