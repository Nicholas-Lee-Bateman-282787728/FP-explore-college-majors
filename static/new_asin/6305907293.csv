7897259,4,6305907293,"Almost a horror story to watch, knowing this will not end well. It's on YouTube - Rorschach test comments below are eye opening and frankly, very sad. My ""piece of the elephant"" impression of the woman is clearly she is not healthy (run Clay, run!!); I kept hoping he would notice all those blaring alarms and red flags (or take offense at her calling him the N-word the first time, or embarrassment at her behavior towards and in front of the other passengers) and walk away from her to a seat in another car. Learning about the author of the piece, Leroi Jones, sheds some light and had me shaking my head - dude had major issues, a lot of hatred. Lula is a predator, probably of the Cluster B Personality Disorder type. How she escapes being arrested for murder or manslaughter to get another man in her crosshairs is beyond comprehension, but this is Leroi Jones' ""piece of the elephant"" and sadly, from the comments, many other black men too. The film is visually arresting, well made, Music score perfectly sets the mood. Recommended.",1504656000,2,1040,4.627027027027027

7897261,4,6305907293,"As a theatrical play the entire Black & White film lives within the claustrophobic confines car of a subway train racing through the black tunnels beneath New York City. As in most impersonal places such as subways (elevator's and restroom's), Lula and Clay are the only two who speak and the other people don't look at them for most of the film.

A mild-mannered, conservative black man, Clay [EMMY-Award Winner Al Freeman Jr. (Malcolm X)], minding his own business, rides on an almost empty subway car. Another passenger, a tempestuous, uninhibited white woman, Lula [Academy Award-nominee Shirley Knight (The Dark at the Top of the Stairs)], starts troubling him to get into trouble.

Repressed sexual tension, racial bigotry and violent fury collide in a catastrophic confrontation. It's heart-wrenching to watch Clay be verbally seduced, teased, emasculated and lynched for allowing Lula to drag him down to the depths of her primal existence.

Writer (before he became Amiri Baraka) LeRoi Jones' controversial play is adapted in this dramatically explosive and emotionally raw film made at the height of civil unrest in the '60s, with a timelessly message that's very much relevant to today's audiences. This is highly acclaimed award-winner from Oscar-nominated director Anthony Harvey (The Lion in Winter), with a score by Academy Award winner John Barry (Dances with Wolves).",1401062400,3,1384,5.310502283105023
7897262,5,6305907293,In light of the recent death of Al Freeman Jr. it would be a great tribute to re-release this film at a more accessible price so that everyone can sample his greatness. My one star is for the prohibitive price. I have recently acquired a watchable version of the film and it is a classic. Would still live to have a quality version.,1344643200,4,332,4.285714285714286
7897263,5,6305907293,"Well, few enough people will drop by this site, and yet I'll leave a comment.  The play is raw and memorable, and
the acting is through the roof.  I'm not surprised that Shirley Knight won the Venice Film Festival award for Best
Actress.  She is fearless here, going places that I'm not sure I've ever seen another actress go.  And stop and think:
this was released in 1966.  Six years before 1966 it was the fifties, and it was a ""Leave It To Beaver"" world.
I'm amazed that this was made--even in England--and released in America in those times.  To those of you who
have never seen it, do it.  Take the plunge.  You will remember this one for the rest of your days.",1335916800,5,667,4.32258064516129

7897265,5,6305907293,"Think about how many films really affect you...deep in your gut.  This is one of those.  It's hard to believe this film came out in 1966, let alone 2006. It has been said there is nothing like it in film...before or since.  The sex is hungry and the racial exchange bitter.  This is not a film for a tame Sidney Poitier.

The film opens with a subway train streaming through the black tunnels beneath New York City. A pretty white girl - a sexual tease - attempts to seduce a nicely dressed black man on a subway. Initially, they are alone in this hot box of a subway car. She suggests sex, then pulls away, then suggest sex again. The fellow gets aroused and later the emotions get hot when she demeans him and he reveals his disdain for white civilization.  Then there is an explosive climax.

The music and the photography work together to give this movie a lean, hard, and at times, expressionistic feel.  If you are up to the challenge...ready to be ripped apart...then this film will not disappoint.

This is on my list of the top 10 films made...ever. The director had an uncanny ability to show the inner lives of personalities in conflict with each other.  No surprise, then, he directed ""The Lion in Winter"" and forced Katherine Hepburn's to give one of her most daring performances.",1235174400,8,1293,4.5344827586206895
7897266,3,6305907293,Fascinating watching Shirley Knight act out this role.  She did a superb job.,1231459200,,77,4.923076923076923
7897267,5,6305907293,"With a running time of just under one hour, DUTCHMAN has enough dramatic explosiveness to rock a movie theatre to pieces. Based on the play by LeRoi Jones (before he changed his name to Amiri Baraka), DUTCHMAN tells the story of Clay (Daytime Emmy Award-winner Al Freeman, Jr.), a seemingly mild-mannered black man that encounters an uninhibited white woman named Lula (two time Academy Award nominee Shirley Knight).
While sitting in a subway car, Clay glances out the window and catches the eye of Lula. Before long, Lula is in the subway car and the fireworks begin.
Like many plays of the 1960s, DUTCHMAN is not afraid of being provocative. It deals with not only issues of race, but sexuality in a very frank manner. Despite being made before the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) started their ratings system, the film has a frankness that would still make it provocative to even today's jaded audiences.
Shirley Knight gives a livewire performance that is absolutely fearless. Al Freeman, Jr. plays his character honestly and with complete conviction. Both actors are unafraid to explore the inner depths of this material. The result is absolutely riveting.
Today, when even an actor of Denzel Washington's stature will not be seen kissing a white woman on screen, Freeman and Knight pull few stops here. The result is a film that dares to make the viewer uncomfortable. Recent independent efforts like MONSTER'S BALL, L.I.E., STORYTELLING and IRREVERSIBLE might go there, but don't expect to see this in a mainstream film of today.
Adding to the film's intensity is the fact that Clay and Lula are the only characters that speak in the film. Also, all of the action takes place inside a hot subway car giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Without revealing too much of the dramatic details, things get pretty intense inside there.
Despite being filmmed in Britain with a more polished look, the DUTCHMAN is clearly within the tradition of the maverick independent films of the early 1960s like SHADOWS and THE CONNECTION.
For her work in the film, Shirley Knight won the prestigious Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 1967 Venice Film Festival. Anthony Harvey, future Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for THE LION IN WINTER directed the film. Multiple Academy Award winner John Barry did the haunting score.
If you're looking for light, Disney fare, you're best to stay away. However, if you're looking for a film that will stir your intellect as well as your emotions, DUTCHMAN should definitely be high on your viewing list. Just be prepared for the ride.",1047686400,21,2583,4.953917050691245
7897268,5,6305907293,"Dutchman is a play by LeRoi Jones (aka Amiri Baraka) set to this 1966 film starring Shirley Knight.  First thing that strikes you is Knight's Sexyness with a capital S.  She's all over the screen and Al Freeman Jr. as well.  The whole hourlong Kerouacesque meditation on life, sex, and race plays out  in black and white (pun intended) in a subway car.  Bears some similarity  to its contemporary, The Incident (Martin Sheen), but Dutchman goes far  deeper in its artistic eloquence.
The underlying beatnik  stream-of-consciousness dialectic between Lula and Clay, like much work of  the '60s era, says much more than it's consciously aware of.  What would  happen if someone suddenly becomes ""Authentic"" within the usually  forced inauthentistic realm of a subway car, and prompts her cohort to do  the same?  I.e. Lula and Clay say and do Exactly as their true selves  dictate.  And the concept succeeds in its spontaneity, intensity, and  message.  Essentially a New York underground (pun intended) work of  high-art.  Needless to say it's only ""contrived"" in Leonard  Maltin's nerdish mind.",962755200,20,1094,5.1022727272727275
