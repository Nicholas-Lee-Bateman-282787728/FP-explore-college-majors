8056229,5,B0008G2I6A,"My personal favorite Lupin movie. It's no Cagliostro(VERY far from that film), but on it's own it's extrememly fun and entertaining! Great animation, English voice cast, and soundtrack, make this an excellent movie! And while the plot isn't very strong, you find yourself attached and following it. Maybe less the story and more the characters in the story, but hey, isn't that the case with all the Lupin movies?",1439769600,,413,5.0
8056230,5,B0008G2I6A,"Really, people, how about replacing the erroneously displayed book with the actual DVD cover so customers can see what they're buying?

Anyway, I found this to be a delightfully entertaining romp of a film.  It's not deep, it's fun, and that's much of the reason for watching Lupin III in the first place.  Plus, since this was not a TV special, it was a theatrical release, the animation quality is a cut above, and that's nice to see.  It's also good to see that the film is aging better than one might have thought it would when it came out (1995), since the millennial fuss over the prophecies of Nostradamus are long done with.

I'm afraid I can't speak to the quality of the dub by Funimation because English dubs make me squirm.  They are universally so inferior to the original Japanese that I always watch things sub-titled.  I will say that the subs are good overall and I can say that with some degree of assurance because I do speak enough Japanese to get by.  My one major problem with the translation here would be the title.  Why does Funimation find it necessary to change the titles of movies for no apparent reason other than pretentiousness?  The real title, which is often rendered as ""Die, Nostradamus"" but is really much closer to the harsher ""Drop Dead, Nostradamus"", is far more appropriate.  People will take one look and know before they even make the purchase that they won't be getting ""Castle of Cagliostro.""  If they had to change the title (but why? Why?!), at least go for something daring like ""Fujiko's Adventures in Babysitting"" instead of wimping out and choosing to censor a non-curse.",1400544000,,1622,4.672535211267606
8056231,3,B0008G2I6A,"I am a huge fan of Lupin the 3rd, so I always try to take the opportunity to pick up movies in the series. This movies is pretty entertaining, and focuses around Lupin and the gang, going up against the ""Nostradamus Sect"", a cult that claims to be able to predict the future, but in actuality is trying to seek world domination. I do not want to give too much away, but the plot is enaging and the action is entertaining. In contrast to ""The Castle of Cagliostro"", this movie is very much a ""Monkey Punch"" Lupin movie. What I mean, when I say that, his Lupin's sexual appetite, and Fujiko's overt sexuality, is not subdued, as it was in Miyasaki's version of the Lupin series, in the ""Castle of Cogliostro"". Lupin drools and leers over any ""T&A"" he crosses paths with, and Fujiko finds her way into  exposing outfits wherever she goes, and even appears naked. For the adult viewer, this is no issue, but this movie is not as kid friendly as the ""Castle of Cagliostro"". This movie was distributed, and the english dubb produced by, Funimation. In my opinion, Funimation did a better job with the dubbing and voice acting, that ""Manga"", who's english dub of ""Castle of Cagliostro"" was almost unbearable. Overall this movie is pretty good and entertaining.

My only complaint with this movie , is not the movie itself, but the quality of the DVD disc I received. When I opened the case the disc already had some huge scratches on it. I am not sure if this happened during shipment, or what, but I had to fickle with it just to get it to play. On top of that, the beggening and the end of the movie, freeze or crash, so I was not able to see the movie straight through without, skipping past the sketchy parts. This was very frustrating, and if I wasn't in a foreign country, with a very poor postal sytstem, I would probably return it for another copy.",1344124800,,1849,4.435294117647059
8056232,4,B0008G2I6A,This one has a great plot and plenty of action and humor and you get to meet some of Lupin's family. But unfortunately it contains some nudity and other rated R stuff. PG in Japan is not the same as PG in the US,1169078400,,211,3.8181818181818183
8056233,5,B0008G2I6A,"This is one of my third favorite Lupin movies. While Castle of Cagliostro is #1 and Dead or Alive is #2.

There's is so much happening. It has a lot to do with religious cult called the ""Nostradamus Sect"". Which is an actual religion founded by a man named Micheal Nostradamus who lived in the 16th century.

There's a giant skyscrapper called the ""Douglas Media Skyscrapper"" who is own by the billionaire Douglas who is trying to win Presidental election.",1140998400,3,456,4.6875
