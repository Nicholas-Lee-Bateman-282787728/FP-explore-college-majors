777938,5,6304089627,"Jim Henson began a wonderful work back in the 70s with his creative Muppet characters; I grew up with the Muppet Show and was greatly saddened by his death.
How could anyone, even his son, do justice to the work he'd started? It's never as good as the original, right?
Wrong. Brian Henson has, with his full-length Muppet features, not only continued the fine family entertainment tradition his father began, but has surpassed all expectations. Muppet Treasure Island, while perhaps a bit scary for some toddlers (the singing skulls in the beginning provide a particular thrill/chill), is creative, innovative, hilarious, and contains some of the cleverest dialogue I've heard in a family film. Family filmakers generally realize that adults must watch the movie with their youngsters, but can't seem to produce a product that truly appeals to both generations. There is dialogue in Muppet Treasure Island that will have adults smothering their laughter while their children ask what was so funny. There is entertainment for all in this one! The music is especially wonderful, just about every number is a memorable hit - ""Cabin Fever"" is definately the standout, though.
I bought this movie when I was 29 years old, and had no children. I actually went to see it in the theater with no ""excuse"" of a child to bring. Now that I have a toddler, we enjoy it together. This one, along with Muppet Christmas Carol, receives high marks from adults and children alike.",974073600,3,1462,4.9471544715447155
777939,5,6304089627,"I have watched this about 8 times now. The opening song ""Shiver My  Timbers"" is so catchy, I got the soundtrack. Tim Curry's laugh alone  in this movie makes it worth buying. The movie really works magic with  subtle and blatant humor. Rent it, or just save time and buy it.",968457600,2,274,4.333333333333333
777940,5,6304089627,"This modern Muppet take on the classic story will have you laughing and  cheering,not to mention singing along to the film's catchy tunes. Newcomer  Kevin Bishop stars as Jim Hawkins,an orphan boy who wants nothing more than  to have a good adventure. Along with his sidekicks,the Great Gonzo and Rizzo  the Rat,Jim heads off in search of treasure with a map given to him by sea  captain Billy Bones,played by Billy Connolly. Aboard the ship,Jim finds a  friend in the charming,but unsuspectingly evil Long John Silver,played to  perfection by Tim Curry,who has a history of handling evil characters. When  Jim is captured by the pirates,it's up to Gonzo,Rizzo,Captain  Smollett(played by Kermit the Frog),and Squire Trelawney and Mr  .Bimble(Fozzie the Bear and the man who lives in his finger)to rescue  him. The movie includes a subplot of Captain Smollett's reunion with his  long lost love,Benjamina Gunn,played,of course,by none other than Miss  Piggy. A wonderful,hilarious movie for the whole family.",965779200,9,1008,5.30379746835443
777941,4,6304089627,"MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND is another great number from the Henson production house. The Muppets present their take on the classic tale: with Miss Piggy as an island castaway, Tim Curry on fine ham acting as Long John Silver and  Kermit returning as Captain Smollet the movie is fun and often incredibly  funny.
There are the obligatory musical numbers which seem to be a  precedent for Muppet movies - but each and every song in MUPPET TREASURE  ISLAND does not disappoint. They're all catchy, funny and well-written and  presented.
The plot takes a supporting role only to the zany antics of  Gonzo, Fozzie et al. and the human cameos (another Muppet precedent) will  bring a smile to your face: particularly Jennifer Saunders in fine  grotesque comedic form.",963705600,,757,4.9523809523809526
777942,5,6304089627,"I personally loved this movie, and rented it because I am going to play the lead role (Jim Hawkins) in our school presentation of it.

777943,5,6304089627,"My children and I laugh til it hurts every time we play this movie. And the characters are so funny.  The bear with the little man living in his finger,and the goat (Clueless Morgan) have some of the funniest lines in  the movie.  And the part where the whole cast does ""Cabin Fever""  is hysterical!  Both this and Muppet Christmas Carol are two of my family's  favorite films.  We go around our house singing the songs and saying the  quotes.  Brian Henson has both captured his father's creative spirit and  vision.  But, in my opinion, he has surpassed his father's filmmaking skill  as shown by the sheer quality of the last two Muppet movies.  I truly look  forward to his next project.",913161600,3,691,4.557377049180328

This  film  could  have  been  done  so  much  better.  But  it  is  surprisingly  annoying.
Kermit  is  stupid  in  this  movie,  at  least  when  he  fights  long  John Silver  (Not  bad  for  an  amphibian).  If  you  want  the  right  kind  of  Muppet  movie  check  out  the  original  movie,  where  Kermit  &  the  gang  go  to  Hollywood.
This  is  the  only  Treasure  island  movie  where  Long John Silver  is  more  of  a  bad  guy  then  he  is  in  other  Treasure Island  movies.

778017,5,6304089627,"It was great to see all your old Muppet friends in a classic. The singing adds a new dimension to the story. Not that ""Sixteen Men on a Deadman's Chest"" is not good in its self. In addition, the beautiful Benjamina Gunn added a more romantic touch. By the way, if you enjoy the singing skulls you may also want to view the movie ""8 Heads in a Dufflbag"" with George Hamilton. The song ""Cabin Fever"" will have you singing along.

Talk about sophisticated dialog.
Benjamina Gunn says, ""You left me standing at the altar!""
Captain Smollet replies, ""I was on a ship headed for Zanzibar. I got cold feet.""
Benjamina Gunn, ""You're a frog! You're supposed to have cold feet!""

Tim Curry (being himself) was an excellent Long John silver. The only other film where he exceeded this is in the film ""Oscar"" with Sylvester Stallone.

This movie was nominated for both Golden Satellite Award and Young Artist Award.
No matter how you CUT it this is a worthwhile movie to own.

778202,1,6304089627,"This movie really wasn't what I had expected. I heard glowing reviews of this movie and with a G rating I thought it would be safe to have the whole family watch for the first time. But it was a complete failure in my opinion.

I had three complaints with this movie. First, all the references to drinking and drunkenness. I mean, I shouldn't have to explain to my kids was rum is, getting drunk, and all that. I wish all this were reduced to a single scene but it seemed prevalent throughout. Second, and worse, all the references to death and violence. In the opening scene, where the captain and his seamates are burying their treasure, after the crew has dug the hole, the captain pulls out his guns and shoots every one dead. Later in the movie, you see their dead bodies strung up on a poles. Every five minutes during the movie, there was ""I'm going to kill you"", ""we're gonna die"", or ""don't worry; he's already dead."" There was this unnecessary amount of beat-em-up fighting, wicked betrayal, torturing, and literal back-stabbing--which would be fine for a movie geared towards an older audience. But cmon, it's a G rated movie. I don't think it deserves higher than a PG, but this movie is obviously geared towards a more mature audience. Third, bad story and ranting dialogue. This is relatively minor but the story was really really bad. I don't suppose many people watched for the story-line. Half the time, you couldn't understand what the characters were saying, even if it was loud. Which given how much they talked about drinking and death, that's probably a good thing anyway.

I'm sure many will disagree with my analysis, calling the movie nostalgic and quirky-fun. But I couldn't wait until the move was over. Even my young son gave the movie 3/10. I think he was being generous.",1478476800,,1800,4.6572327044025155

I love seeing which of the muppets play my favorite characters from the original text by Robert Louis Stevenson. And the hilarious songs! You'll be singing along without even knowing it just as you do with Disney productions. As for the live actors, Billy Connolly, Jennifer Saunders and Tim Curry really hit the nail on the head with a goofy twist--but would you ask anything less of a Muppet movie?",1472601600,,555,4.673469387755102

My eight year old loved it how ever they are pirates and ruff and tumble so if your family in particularly conservative maybe having the adults preview it first before having the children watch it. The songs are amazing and so much fun I didn't realize I was smiling and having a great time with the kids. Definitely will watch again!,1442361600,,526,4.489583333333333

I also think Tim Curry as Long John Silver and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins were great casts; they play their roles so well, and they're both likeable as villain and hero. Gonzo and Rizzo are awesome as always, of course. I can't recommend this film enough, if you're a fan of the Muppets or treasure-hunting pirates!",1420761600,,480,4.528735632183908

778867,5,6304089627,"Although liked at its release this was not a ""beloved Muppet film"" when it first came out.  That's a shame because it actually is a fairly accurate following of the original Robert Louis Stevenson story sans the violence. It Muppetizes Louis' world in a way that lets the human actors all shine brighter than the muppets and perhaps that's what the early reviewers didn't care for.  Anyone who reviews the Muppets movie to critically needs to have them sells reviewed by a competent psychiatric team. This is fun family fluff and I think stands the test of time very well.  After all what do you want to do, go on an adventure or ""stand around to see what half burned vicious Pirates look like?""",1419897600,,695,4.588709677419355

For me it was about the muppets and my favorite movie villain actor of all time. I have watched almost everything with Tim Curry in it. Love the sound of his voice and his laughter. I'm also a fan of the dry wit and humor the muppets tend to bring to the silver screen.
There is only one portion of this movie I can't stand. The Cabin Fever singing number. But that's not enough to dissuaded me from watching this movie.
It is the typical Treasure Island movie that has been done every few years. And each time the only thing you can hope is that they bring a small spin to the movie. Be it comedy or tragedy. In this case songs and puppets, and some humor.
I would recommend this movie to just about anyone who is a fan of the muppets. It's great to watch, just a little painful on HDtvs.",1387065600,2,969,4.159574468085107

Despite this picture's darker nature in comparison to some of it's predissessors, it is by no means less entertaining...come on, it's the Muppets...they're synonimus with entertainment.  Kermit and the gang live up to their timeless reputation and are joined by human actors Kevin Bishop, Tim Curry, and others to bring us this adaptation of the classic novel by Robert Louis Stevenson.  True, the film takes a few liberties with it's source material, but it is after all an adaptation, and the changes work in this context.  It's an enjoyable watching experience that manages to hang onto the core themes of the book without scaring off it's younger audience.  Kevin Bishop, whom I've never heard of before this film, plays the main character, Jim Hawkins, perfectly.  Tim Curry is, as always, the perfect villain and never overdoes the evil nature of Long John Silver.  And, while the Muppets keep their roles comedic, none of them ever overdo it either, which is what ultimately makes this film great.  It's a must-have for any Muppet fan.",1381449600,3,1167,5.036458333333333

779352,5,6304089627,"Without question this is my favourite Muppet film - a purely delicious treat, perfectly adapted for a nice and happy familial evening, when adults, children and pets sit around the screen to watch a good movie, have a healthy laugh and enjoy the life!

This being a Muppet production and also a surprisingly faithful adaptation of ""Treasure Island"" there is hardly any need to tell anything about the plot, except that this film was masterfully done and it is clear from the begininng that all those who worked on it had GREAT fun doing it! I believe that all Muppet's gang is present here and the characters were very skillfully distributed amongst the ""Treasure Island"" plot - and that really asked for some careful reflection, because honestly, it was not easy to fit in the Swedish Chef, not even talking about a place for Miss Piggy in a book notoriously devoided of female characters...))) But it was done, and it was done VERY WELL INDEED.

As you can expect from Muppets, this film is filled with jokes, puns and slapstick moments, but also with excellent songs. And Tim Curry portrays here an AMAZING Long John Silver as a redoubtable albeit NOT ENTIRELY evil pirate, a killer cook (pun very much intentional) and a Holy-Molly-Guacamole-Is-He-Good-Or-What singer of sea shanties - gosh, the VOICE this guy has!!

I LOVED this film, all our family spend a wonderful evening (even our chipmunks rolled on the floor laughing) and we are going to certainly see it again. Enjoy!",1373587200,2,1482,4.826771653543307

Well, upon re-watching this film, I was vastly over-estimating the obnoxious bits and vastly under-estimating the incredible songs and humor in this movie.  This is probably one of the better Muppet musicals, with the original songs being creative and very funny.  Tim Curry is excellent as Long John Silver and Kermit is, of course, a great Captain Smollet.

To be honest, this movie was so funny and clever that it ruined the actual original Treasure Island novel for me, I read it and though it was fun and nice I thought it wasn't nearly as good as the Muppet spoof!!

I give this DVD package three stars for the utter lack of features. It does have wide screen and full screen options.....and that's all. Nothing else. No commentary. No funny vignettes (like they do on some of their other DVDs). Not even trailers to promote other movies.

Pros:
- Restored Well
- Full Screen and Wide Screen options

Cons:

The disk also contains a ""cropped"" full-screen version--which I really don't understand why anyone would ever want to watch a movie that way, given a choice.

Oh yeah, the movie is the best! Adults will be entertained by the copius amount of double entendres, puns, and *inside* jokes. The kids just love the characters, plot, music, and fast-paced flow.

I will say that some of the scenes, like Blind Pew's entrance at the beginning and some of the scenes with skeletons are a little too scary for small kids. Tim Curry gives a brilliantly twisted performance as Long John with a memorable over-the-top imitation of a fire and brimstone preacher. Miss Piggy comes in late in the movie, but she has some hilarious one-liners.

779771,5,6304089627,"What happens when you mix one of ""the"" classic pirate stories with the wonderfully wacky world of the muppets and the delightfully villanous Tim Curry?  Muppet Treasure Island, of course!

I first saw this movie years ago and instantly fell in love with it.  Having already been a fan of the Muppets - and having loved ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"", another wonderful Muppet adapation of classic literature - I was not disappointed at all!

Kevin Bishop does a wonderful job as the delightfully innocent Jim Hawkins, a simple boy who wants to go off to sea like his father did, but to whom ""pirates"" are an abstract concept.  He's easily beguiled by appearances until he's literally faced with the proof and must make a decision about those who he calls friends.

As in ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" Gonzo and Rizzo are probably my two favorite Muppets.  The interaction and the humor between the two of them has me roaring with laughter every single time they speak.  (Gonzo: ""That's right, we'd be out searching for that treasure, sailing the seven seas on a five-year mission, boldly going where no man has gone before!  Say that's catchy!"" and later... Rizzo: ""Yeah, I'll watch for him, if he's delivering a pizza!"")  Of course, there is also wonderful comedic timing from the other muppets, particularly the two heckling Muppets, and some great one-liners from Kermit (I'm a frog...slippery hands?!), Miss Piggy (I'm a pig, I need committment!)

Of course, the real coup de grace for me in this film is Tim Curry as the deliciously evil Long John Silver.  I absolutely love movies where Tim Curry gets to play the bad guy, and he doesn't fail to disappoint here either.  Mr. Curry has said in interviews that this was one of his favorite and most memorable roles to play, and you can see how much he's enjoying it throughout the entire movie!

In addition, the music is amazing, the action (especially the fight scenes) is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, and the fact that this is an adaptaion of an amazing piece of classic literature is enough to thrill and delight me, since I am an English teacher who sometimes has difficulty getting my students interested in ""the classics"".

Definitely a five-star product all around...you will not be disappointed by this movie unless you hate the Muppets!",1271030400,,2309,4.766331658291457

There was far more action and the plot was changed drastically for the movie. By reading the original, I could see the creative changes that the director and producers had to make in order to fit it in the narrowly crazy world of the Muppets. Great movie for the family.

779817,4,6304089627,"Like many other muppet movies, this movie is so well done in that we don't even think about the fact that many of the characters are puppets, but some of them are human as well.

The movie starts with Billy Bones telling telling the story of one of his adventures with a group of pirates. Really soon, a pirate from his past appears with a death threat. (Giving someone a death threat and allowing him to live a little longer can actually be worse than killing him right away. In some cases, fear of death can be worse than death itself.) Supposedly, Billy Bones double crossed the pirates he had worked with. (There are some rules that even a bad guy obeys. And one of them is not double crossing your comrades.)

Moving on, Gonzo, Rizzo, and the young Jim go on an adventure to find the lost buried treasure. The trip is lead by our favorite frog. We also meet Tim Curry who seems nice enough, but we get the impression that he is hiding his true intentions.

Very quickly, we later discover that Tim Curry is not a simple cook, but rather he is an effective pirate who has been 'playing the cook' to get the information he needs. In some ways, he is very bad, but he carries a charm that makes him likable. And to be fully honest, he does have some redeeming traits. (When his own life is threatened, he allows the young Jim to escape to safety. And in a rather touching moment, he returns the 'borrowed under a threat' compass to Jim. The compass had once belonged to Jim's dead father.)

One point worth some attention here is that at one point Tim Curry faces death threats from his own group of pirates. Someone apparently did their 'pirate research.' A pirate captain only remained in control as long as he kept his crew happy. (There is no law for a pirate to turn to.) So the point that his crew was ready to kill him at one point is realistic. To Tim Curry's credit, the way he avoids it, and wins back the loyalty of his crew shows just how sharp and shrewd his character is.

Rather predictably, our favorite frog, (who is now a captain) runs into a former girlfriend he left at the altar. (Not surprisingly she is a pig.) There reunion of course has some tension, but we also see that reconciliation is possible. With some well placed comic moments, we see that she has been with some other men since, including Tim Curry.

Without going on too long, we have the 'often wanted in pirate movies' final conflict. And sensing what we 'as the audience' probably wanted, Tim Curry escapes justice.

The songs are especially well placed, and Gonzo and Rizzo offer their usual narration with charm.

Overall, it's a great movie that can delight a lover of pirates. If you liked Scooby Doo's ""Pirates Ahoy,"" you will probably like this.",1241481600,,2742,4.448207171314741

779822,4,6304089627,"Muppet Treasure Island is not the strongest Muppet movie but it provides good entertainment nonetheless. There is a little bit of violence so I would suggest that very young children not see this film. Older kids and the child in all of us will enjoy it, however. The plot moves along rather quickly and the musical numbers overall are rather well done. The quality of the image is better than it was for the original Muppet movie; and that's certainly another positive.

When the action begins, we meet young Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop) who slaves in a 1700's English tavern owned by Mrs. Bluberidge (Jennifer Saunders) along with his friends Gonzo and Rizzo the rat. Soon a patron, Billy Bones (Billy Connolly) tells yet again the story of how a buried treasure is located in the Caribbean. Billy has a heart attack and dies--but just before his death he gives the treasure map to young Jim to avoid it going into the hands of the pirates who are raiding the bar. Yes, that's a lot of action for the first seven or eight minutes of a movie; but that's what you see.

It isn't long before Jim, Rizzo and Gonzo commission a ship through a supposedly prestigious shipping company--which, it turns out, is being temporarily operated by the son of the owner, Fozzie Bear. Fozzie is clearly running with ""a few loose screws;"" he thinks that there is a man living inside his finger named Mr. Bimbo and Fozzie ""lets"" Mr. Bimbo pick the crew for the voyage--and the crew turns out to be largely a gang of pirates disguised as crew members so that Long John Silver, posing as the ship's cook, can mutiny with them, take Captain Smollett (Kermit The Frog) and the rest hostage and steal the treasure just for themselves.

Once they get to the island where the buried treasure is, all mayhem breaks loose. Yes, there is a rebellion--but how will Captain Smollett, his First Mate Sam The Eagle, Jim Hawkins, Gonzo and Rizzo keep them at bay and fight for the treasure? Will Long John Silver get away with his mutiny and steal the treasure for himself? What about the elusive Queen of the island--could she have a complicated past with Captain Smollett? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch the movie and find out!

The DVD comes with really only one extra--a short featurette that mimics an expose' on Fozzie Bear as a comic. You also get to choose whether you want to watch the film in widescreen or fullscreen. I wish there had been more! Perhaps there is more on the 50th anniversary edition DVD of this movie.

Overall, Muppet Treasure Island isn't as good as The Muppet Movie or The Muppets Take Manhattan; but don't write this one off just yet. It's not a bad movie and I do recommend it for solid family entertainment except for very young children; parents should wait a bit to show this movie to them.",1233619200,,2797,4.608433734939759

My 2 year old daughter can testify to this: she has her favourite moments, which she insists Daddy plays on DVD! This I have done incessantly (about 3-4 times a week) since I got this in August '05!

All the Muppet elements are there: the big-scale ensemble performances from familiar and beloved Muppet characters; Catchy musical numbers (Hans Zimmer did a superb job scoring for this); delightfully crafted set pieces and costumes, etc.

The story is one we're all familiar with, yet Kirk Thatcher and longtime Muppet writer Jerry Juhl have come up with a erm...watertight screenplay powered by a funny and witty script.

It is no wonder Tim Curry wanted to be a part of this project. Not only is he a fascinating performer to watch, but he looks like he's having so much fun hamming it up with deliciously evil glee!

Kudos also to stalwart Muppeteers like Frank Oz , Eric Goelz and Jerry Nelson for performances that still retain that ol' Muppet magic.",1125792000,2,1086,4.664921465968586

780060,5,6304089627,"I absolutely love this movie; this movie got me interested in the Muppets, period.  I am a fan of adventure stories, and Treasure Island is one of my favorites.

The movie does not follow the book religiously of course; Jim is an orphan, and has two interesting ""brothers"" (Gonzo and Rizzo) that work with him in the inn under a tyrannical innkeeper.  (Mrs. Bluveridge.)

With Tim Curry as Long John Silver, Kermit the Frog as Capt. Smollett, and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (with a whole tribe of wild pigs for backup) this movie could not get any better.

The comedy is througout the film, but doesn't overpower it so that there's no plot or emotion involved.  There are daring swordfights, and mysterious places.  Even a song about going insane.  (Gotta love that.)

780061,5,6304089627,"I was thrilled to see the news on [...] that Disney would be releasing 4 of the Muppets fillms on DVD this November for a special Anniversary release.  The 4 movies will be The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Christmas Carol, and Muppet Treasure Island.  I have purchased all these films in the past on DVD but the two later films were somewhat incomplete.  As any die-hard muppet fan knows, when Disney released MTI, and MCC on DVD in 2002 they only put out full-screen versions.  Not only that, but the films showed a considerable amount of grain and dust.  Disney's poor treatment of the muppets caused a considerable outcry from fans like myself and many of us even went so far as to boycott buying the DVDs.  Last year however Disney bought the Muppets and has seemed to be paying much more attention to satisfying the fans.  Disney has just released the first season of the Muppet Show on DVD with one of the original pilots, ""The Muppet's Sex and Violence"" as one of several bonus features.  Although it has not yet been offically stated at this time, it is hoped and assumed that Disney will be putting all of the Muppet films onto DVD in their original widescreen aspect ratio.  I was pleased with the bonus features on MTI, and MCC but would love to see some more.  The Muppet Movie, and GMC were released once before by Columbia Tristar in widescreen but with no bonus material.  The thing that matters most to me is that the films are remasted and preserved.  Disney's offical anouncment did state that the films are to have digitally remastered video and audio.  Check back soon for more info about the apect ratio, I am almost certain that Disney is now smart enough not to make the same mistakes twice.",1124064000,10,1734,4.554838709677419

The film stars Tim Curry as the Long John Silvers, although many other humans had strong parts as well, including Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins (the boy), and Billy Connolly (proprietor of map.)  All the fun is here though, and basically the whole storyline of the novel, as the Muppets sing and dance their way through the film.

This film is very entertaining for the whole family.  A few dark parts might mar it for really young children, but I find that most kids would enjoy it, as I did when I was younger.",1104537600,6,785,4.611510791366906

If you want a pan-and-scan Foolscreen DVD, go ahead and buy it, but I suggest that people who want to see the film unedited should wait for when Disney decides to release it in Widescreen.

780131,5,6304089627,"I've seen all the muppet movies, but this one is my favorite. Granted, the first Muppet Movie had awesome songs by the great Paul Willaims, and the Great Muppet Caper was a terrific spoof on classic Hollywood films. But this movie is different.
I believe it was Brian Henson who said that the difference in this movie is the world that we see. In the previous muppet movies, the muppets were strange creatures living in the human world. But in Muppet Treasure Island, it's the humans who are the odd ones. This is a ""Muppet World"" through and through. The first clue as to the validity of this statement is the opening credits. The main characters are played by Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog, the Great Gonzo, and the other muppets. Not by puppeteers. By muppets.
Despite the fact that the movie stays pretty true to the book Treasure Island in terms of plot, the execution of it is completely wild muppet madness. Anything and everything is made fun of in this movie (including the fact that it's a movie!) For instance, in several of the excellent songs sung by the muppets (and a wonderful Tim Curry playing Long John Silver), the characters make reference to the fact that it IS a musical number.
And speaking of musical numbers, the songs in this movie are absolutely great. My family bought the soundtrack, and they listen to the songs all the time (especially ""When You're a Professional Pirate""). And let's not forget the excellent background music by Hans Zimmer, who still knows how to crank out a good old-fashioned film score.
This movie is filled with all sorts of wackiness, right down to the names of some of the charcters (old Tom, real old Tom, Dead Tom), and jokes made in the movie come back later to make them ever funnier (""Dead Tom's Dead! Long John shot him!""). But this movie is more than just great fun. It's a well scripted, well acted, and in general well made film. It's got everything. Action, adventure, romance. And of course, singing. It's great family entertainment, with a lot of heart and a wonderful message about friendship. If you love the muppets, definitely see this movie. Especially if you like the story of Treasure Island...",1052956800,95,2166,4.687664041994751
780132,5,6304089627,"Except, perhaps, for the new movie Treasure Planet, I'd have to say that, despite the fact that this movie stars our favorite Frog and Pig, it's one of the best retellings of the classic swashbuckling adventure by Robert Louis Stevenson.
Jim Hawkins lives at an inn, where he also works for his keep as the bus boy, along with his compatriots Rizzo and Gonzo. Billy Bones is a frequent patron of the inn, and constantly tells the story of Captain Flynt's buried treasure. Most dismiss the tale as a result of too much rum...until Blind Pew, a doddering bat, delivers the Black Spot; the pirate's death sentence. Billy frantically bequeaths a treasure map to Jim. Jim flees the attacking pirates with his friends, and enlists Squire Trelawney (Fozzie), an interested son of the shipbuilder, to charter a ship. The rest is classic history: Jim meets cook Long John Silver - - the man with the one leg that Billy warned Jim of - - and the ship sails to the lost island in search of treasure.
The characters are excellently-cast; even those that aren't Muppets. Tim Curry makes an excellent Long John. It's always interesting to see how Jim and Long John befriend each other on the ship, and Curry and Bishop pull it off convincingly.
All the while the movie plot is going, the Muppets perform just as usual for their audience, while not ruining the premise of the film, which probably wasn't easy to do. (""He died?"" asks Rizzo over Billy Bones. ""And this is supposed to be a KIDS' movie!"")
They sing lots of catchy songs on board the ship and the island, and Kermit the Frog engages Long John Silver in an amphibian/pirate sword duel before the movie is through. It's sure to entertain all audiences, young and old.
Here's my one beef with the film: Towards the end, a person (Okay, it was Long John Silver) uses the H-word. Perhaps a permissible word for some, but not for others. This was a stupid move, putting even one not-so-nice word in a kids movie, and one which, fortunately, we were able to bleep out of our video copy. Just to give parents a heads-up about the movie. Other things that would frighten young kids would include a band of singing skulls in the very beginning, and hanging skeletons guarding the treasure site.",1050969600,5,2231,4.636363636363637
780133,3,6304089627,"I really liked both ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" and ""Muppet Treasure Island"".  I think the Muppets to a fantastic job adapting literature to the screen in an enjoyable manner and I sincerely wish that they would return to this type of work (especially after the abysmal ""Muppets From Space"").
HOWEVER -- unlike the first three Muppet movies, the DVDs for ""Muppet Treasure Island"" and ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" contain the ""fullscreen"" version only.  ""Fullscreen"" is a euphemism for the cropped image, instead of the ""widescreen"" image (also called ""letterbox"").  In other words you've lost bits of the image to the left and right of the parts you can see ... and with the Muppets there are always little interesting bits going on _everywhere_ in the image.

The story is fun (though it doesn't worry about adhering to Stevenson's book too closely).  The performances and songs are mostly entertaining.  However, the main reason that this DVD is worthwhile is that it offers the most quality extras of any Muppet disc currently available (Muppet Christmas Carol, coming soon, should be comparable).  Muppet Treasure Island features a making of featurette humorously hosted by Gonzo and Rizzo. The same two muppets also contribute to an audio commentary track with Brian Henson.  But--there's more!

I'm hoping that Disney will wise up and re-release this DVD wide screen. Hopefully either refund or give current owners a rebate towards the wide screen version.

Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop), Gonzo, and Rizzo are working in an inn when Captain Billy Bones (Billy Connolly) dies. Before he does however, he gives them a map to a great treasure. They escape from the inn before they're killed by Blind Pew and his pirates. With the financial aid of 'rich, half-witted son' Squire Trelawney (Fozzie the Bear) and the 'man who lives in his finger, Mr. Bimbo', they set off to get the treasure with Captain Abraham Smollet (Kermit the frog). But they watch out for 'the one-legged man' but that doesn't mean it's Long John Silver (Tim Curry)? And while watching the whole movie you'll enjoy seeing all the fun Muppets Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy), Mr. Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), Polly Lobster (Spa'am), and an assortment of other Muppets.
""Muppet Treasure Island"" is so very, very funny! I love the humor in it. One of my favorite lines is when Squire Trelawney doesn't seem to understand what and 'ocean' is. Rizzo says to him, ""You know, the big, blue, wet thing?"" to which Trelawney answers, ""Oh, the big, blue, wet thing!"" I also love all of the songs, especially ""Cabin Fever"", ""Love Let Us Here"", and ""Boom, Shalakala"". They're hilarious!
Don't also miss the other Muppet movies. 1) ""The Muppet Movie"", the very first Muppet movie in which the Muppets go to Hollywood. 2) ""The Great Muppet Caper"" is where the Muppets stop thieves from stealing the great baseball diamond. 3) ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" do just what the title suggests. The Muppets take Manhattan! 4) ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is I think one of the best adaption of Charles Dickens's book. 5) ""The Muppets from Space"" finally explains what Gonzo is.

I've just ordered it on DVD for her as a reward for getting good grades. She'll be so excited when it arrives!

Anyway, my review- this movie is an adaptation of a classic book, with a Muppets twist. They ate very self aware, and add humor to some of the darker parts. A favorite line from the beginning comes from Rizzo the Rat- ""He DIED?!? This is supposed to be a kids' movie!""

Tim Curry is amazing as Long John Silver; his performance in the only song where he's the lead reminds you that he knows his way around a musical, and he adds charm to the character.
There are also some cute cameos, with Billy Bones being played by Billy Connolly, and Jennifer Saunders as Mrs. Bluveridge.
