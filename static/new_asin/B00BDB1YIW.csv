8566657,4,B00BDB1YIW,"Very well made DVD. Recommended to the novice pilot. The author presents in a concise and clear way how to prepare and what to expect during basic aerobatic flight training. This includes how to choose a flight school, aircraft types, safety inspection, parachutes, FAA regulations, what to eat and how to deal with motion sickness among other topics. One detail that I believe is very import, is that the author shows some footage of basic aerobatic maneuvers and, as he describes it, he tells the viewer how much G force to expect on each portion of the maneuver.
NOTE: this DVD does not describes how to perform the aerobatic maneuvers with exception of stall/spin entry and recovery.",1475020800,,687,4.880341880341881
