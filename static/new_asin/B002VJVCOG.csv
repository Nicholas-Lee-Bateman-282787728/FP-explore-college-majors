I suggest watching this one to all people who find it difficult to tolerate gays/les/...Maybe it will open your eyes and minds.

3996219,5,B002VJVCOG,"To approach this DVD you really have to dispense with all the sterotypes of gay men you have ever heard or seen.
This DVD shows another side of gay men which is very really explored.
These men do not fit the usual mold, and for this they shoud be very proud of themselves, but at the same time there seems to be a restrained acceptance of 'self'.
It was somtimes liked watched gay men acting straight, whatever that means these days.
Society has come along so far to quickly sometimes, and pushed homosexuality back into another closet.
The extra inverview with David Kopay is well worth the price alone.",1289952000,,604,4.5504587155963305
3996220,5,B002VJVCOG,"What does it mean to be a man and queer? What is masculinity? For many males in the queer community, these are questions that often left unanswered or at best, left undefined, abstract. They persist because they are important. They create identity.

'The Butch Factor' attempts to explore these questions through interviews of gay men of various persuasions including athletes, drag queens, bears, and others as well as well as psychologists, historians, and authors. They share with us their struggles and insights into the what it masculinity means as a gay man. Some may say these are mere surveys of gay male stereotypes, but truly, it allows for a wide spectrum of identity. All are welcomed into the table of exploration.

Films like this are important because the chronicles the changing images of gender. Our culture's concepts of masculinity are in constant flux, and this is especially important to note within the queer community where, despite being outside of cultural norms, can settle into an unhealthy complacency  in regards to acceptable forms of masculinity. Furthermore, it is an important reminder that there are myriad ways to hold the identities of queer and man simultaneously.

'The Butch Factor' is a beautiful film and highly relevant in this time of deep change. The minor flaw this film has is fails to show any sort of community for effeminate gay men while showing bear and gay athlete communities. Still, the film is important as it puts to rest many of the assumptions society has about the gay male identity and illuminates both their hardships and their triumphs in their struggle for identity and acceptance. Highly recommended.",1279584000,5,1664,5.084249084249084
3996221,5,B002VJVCOG,"I enjoyed seeing a film that addressed a cross section of our community. We neither look the same nor play the same...the media by and large, doesn't cover this side of the gay male life.",1274227200,8,187,4.371428571428571
3996222,5,B002VJVCOG,"Gay and bisexual men long have used ""butch"" and ""straight-acting"" to judge the perceived masculinity, or lack thereof, of other men and their own masculinity. Such terms have provoked debate within the LGBT community; however, not everyone uses those terms...at least, not to mean the same things.
  The Butch Factor  delves into this ongoing struggle to identify what makes one more or less of ""a man."" Filmmaker Christopher Hines scoured the United States for examples of men who represent the masculine end of the gay spectrum. He found police officers, rodeo cowboys, actors and athletes who define themselves as more straight-acting and less effeminate than other gay men. They aren't all anti-femme, and their masculinity seems natural rather than an act.
Hines also interviewed a handful of less-masculine gay men for perspective and balance. For them, their effeminate characteristics are innate and not something they consciously adopted. They are some of the strongest characters in the film because they overcame the abuse they suffered as children for being gay while their more straight-acting counterparts could hide it. The Butch Factor ultimately reveals that long-standing social mores and gender stereotypes are more to blame for the prevailing desire for more masculine traits in a partner, even among gay men. While the movie doesn't settle many arguments, it is an interesting exploration of this enduring debate.",1268092800,16,1434,5.392857142857143
3996223,1,B002VJVCOG,"What a depressing movie! In the gay world it depicts, you're either an indistinguishable half-naked, posturing body in a horde of others who look and act just like you, or you're completely alone with at most one other freak who can stand to look at you, but--in EVERY case--all that matters is what you look like. The great revelation in this movie apparently is that it's finally OKAY to be a jock and gay, or middle-aged and hairy with a beer belly and gay, or grossly musclebound and gay, as long as you can find hundreds of others just like you who like to hang out with their shirts off and either dance or play contact sports. OR you can be a drag queen, or a real-live gay rodeo cowboy, as long as you keep with your own kind. The skinny girly boys still have to be lonely, and evidently the only sane gay man on earth stays that way by avoiding gay society altogether. It's a disgusting confirmation of all the sick old gay stereotypes. The only breath of fresh air is the lone guy who refuses to play the game, and he gets shown repeatedly ALONE, staring off forlornly into space, just like the nelly boys. As a reasonably sane gay man who fits into none of the ""butch"" groups--or ANY group I am aware of--I absolutely hated this movie.",1263945600,32,1246,4.375

8382125,1,B002VJVCOG,"At first I was excited to see an examination of gay masculinity and the lives and perspectives of masculine behaving same gender loving guys.  This was sadly yet another San Francisco centred parade of the exhaustively covered lives of politically correct white gay dudes. Everybody thought the same and lived the same and in the same gay saturated city, mostly.  The lives of masculine performing gay men  are so much more varied than they even attempted to touch.  Where were the rural men, religious gay men, fathers,masculine trans-gay men, gay men in role differentiated relationships, masculine identified men who aren't muscle-bound....and the list goes on.  At least it could've gone on had they done more than peak at variety in masculine gay dudes.  Good cinematography but mostly, as Yogi said ""deja vu all over again""",1517961600,3,829,5.103703703703704
8382126,5,B002VJVCOG,"Im surprised no documentary before (that I knew of) had specifically tackled the topic that director Christopher Hines covers so thoroughly in The Butch Factor. The 87-minute feature explores gay men's complicated relationship with masculinity. The core segments of the film, and the freshest material here, are profiles of several gay men who play traditionally masculine roles: rugby player, construction worker, rodeo bull rider, and so on. Candid interviews about real people's lives often make for the best documentary material, and that's certainly true in The Butch Factor. We learn about the confusion these men felt while growing up and their sometimes painful experiences with living in the closet, as well as the camaraderie they feel just from hanging out with the guys. Hines is a pro, and to paint a complete picture, he includes a few gay men with different approaches to masculinity. Along the way, the movie makes the point that sometimes the effeminate gay men are the toughest because they had to become that way.",1512345600,,1032,5.148809523809524
8382127,1,B002VJVCOG,"Contrivance at its best...should have been called ""The Flock Factor"" with the exception of the two more at-easy with themselves guys. The ""butch"" (if you will) guys flocked to guys who looked like them. Not one of these guys acknowledged the well adjusted gay activist who actually make a difference and are the true masculine role models for the LGBT community in my personal opinion. Bored me to tears!",1428796800,,404,4.869565217391305

If you've started your path in understanding what masculinity means to you, it might not be worth the time.  If you're just starting the process of questioning, though, it's probably worth it.",1394409600,,268,4.5625

8382131,5,B002VJVCOG,"This movie was full of insightful veiwpoints and facts about the way gay culture is and how some gays have been able to navigate around those odds and ends to find their own place in that world. It was helpful for me because it helped me to further realize that I don't have to meet any stereotype or ideal someone else has about being gay. To be gay there is only one requirement: you need to be attracted sexually to the same sex and THAT'S ALL. That has nothing to do with your mannerisms, the way you talk, or your particular interests. Those are all outside things that we ""choose""- how we choose to express our personality to the world. You can still be the sports loving jock, the artistically inclined geek, or the sensitive and affectionate guy that you already are. None of that will change your sexuallity, and vise versa. I think every gay and straight individual needs to see this movie.",1347148800,2,900,4.4939024390243905
8382132,3,B002VJVCOG,"Gays who depend on their looks to get them by when they are 35 and over are in for a surprise. We all age. Our sexual audience diminishes. Look inside yourself and start figuring out what you have to offer the world besides your big penis and pecs.
