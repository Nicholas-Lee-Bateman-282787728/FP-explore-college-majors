8354279,5,B00279JW10,I've been looking everywhere for this DVD and my luck was given when found on Amazon.  This is a great work of art!,1402444800,,115,4.0
8354280,4,B00279JW10,"One of the best recent surf movies I have seen.  Unbelievable barrel footage, great surfing, cool soundtracks, and some good foreign locations, especially in east africa. That first shot there is so so sick. The womens surfing was also insane, and some of Dan Malloys barrels are ridiculous. 5 stars.

The -1 star was the dialogue - its probably a bit unfair to single out this movie when so many of them recently are guilty of it, but come on. What is with the californian style dribbling on how deep they are, pretending to be spontaneous and off the beaten track(with film crew) being soulful and ""individual"" , riding ridiculous retro boards no non-pro could have any fun on, pontificating about the environment (with twenty board quivers, jetskis, plane flights and massive boats) and other wannabe fantasy land crap the surf industry loves to punt these days in selling their merchandise. They are surfers, not actors or rock stars..enough already - stick to the surfing. Its good enough.",1339545600,,994,4.910714285714286
8354281,3,B00279JW10,"Maybe I need to rewatch again, but this surf flick went beyond me. The surfing was ok, the artsyness of it all was a little over the top. Call me old, but this one wasn't one of my favorites, not even top 20. not top 30.. ehhh. its ok.",1330041600,,235,3.816326530612245
8354282,2,B00279JW10,"It seems like there are so many ""surf films"" being produced lately that are throw togethers for magazine promotions. there is nothing really special about this dvd ... grat surfing footage but nothing you can't find accompanying magazines for free (price of the mag.
Sorry... not a hater, just didn't think it was that great.",1287360000,,325,4.927272727272728
8354283,5,B00279JW10,This whole series of films is great. More mellow than a lot of other surf films with a great soundtrack and lots of good surfing. Easy to watch over and over and over.,1265760000,2,167,4.090909090909091
8354284,5,B00279JW10,"Prob. one of my favorites right now, smooth clean well put together, tons of imagery from around the globe, not too cheesy but some fun sections with crazy trickery goin on, watched it handful of times already, love the flic!",1259539200,2,225,4.65
8354285,4,B00279JW10,Like to plan the Next Surf Trip with some idea of what in going on. This video in great. Also includes some good point in Peru.,1257552000,3,127,3.923076923076923
