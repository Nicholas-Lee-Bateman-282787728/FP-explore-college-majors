6333421,2,B00IXQV0BG,"I was going to give it a 3, but Mumtaz is a sick little writer to cause the innocent woman(Anna) to be chopped up. Fortunately, the hitman knocks him off after he has killed all his friends. First ,he does nothing for his fellow criminal friend and then tells him he's on his own and then hacks his girlfriend to death because he cleaned up the accidental killing of the woman he had accidentally killed.

8648184,2,B00IXQV0BG,"I've seen far worse movies.  But while this was a stinker, and it was, at least the acting wasn't half bad.

British pals Craig and Mike are together when Craig's doing a sale of cocaine.  He gets pinched and does five years.  Mike picks him up on his day of release only to be stopped three thugs Mike is somehow into.  Great forward a few hours and Mike and Craig are at Mike's with Mike's girlfriend and he friend --who magically falls for Craig during the party.

Spoilers Follow:
Things take a turn for the worse when the guys start hitting the lines.  One thing leads to another and bingo, not only is Mike taking the big sleep so is his girl.  Craig and his squeeze bail out so fast the bodies don't even have a chance to cool off.

The rest of the story is Craig and his girl trying to keep from being caught while vacationing in the Eastern Mediterranean.",1471824000,,864,4.283950617283951

Minutes, and minutes and minutes wasted watching 4 low-life individuals drink themselves into oblivion.  Pitiful.  A waste of time, clicked off.",1471824000,,263,5.166666666666667
