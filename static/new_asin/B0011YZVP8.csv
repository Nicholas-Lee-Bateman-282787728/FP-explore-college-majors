8434581,2,B0011YZVP8,"I AM A TRUE, FULL-BLOODED STAND UP COMEDY FANATIC!!! ALTHOUGH I AM NOT A DIE HARD FAN OF ALEX THOMAS I DO RESPECT HIS EFFORTS. I EXPECTED MORE FROM HIM BEING THAT HE HAS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR MORE THAN 10+ YEARS. THIS DVD WAS NOT MUCH BETTER THAN HIS PCS DVD ""STRAIGHT CLOWNIN'"" WHICH WAS NOT FUNNY AT ALL (-0). I DID GET A COUPLE (AND ONLY A COUPLE)OF CHUCKLES IN THIS ONE. ALEX FOCUSED MORE ON TRYING TO TALK/SOUND LIKE TUPAC WHEREAS HIS FOCUS SHOULD'VE BEEN ON DELIVERING FUNNIER JOKES. I HAVE TRIED TO LIKE THIS CAT AND SUPPORT HIM BUT IT'S JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE.....HE IS NOT FUNNY!!!!! LEGALIZE BOOTLEGGIN'!!!!",1310169600,,615,4.4035087719298245
