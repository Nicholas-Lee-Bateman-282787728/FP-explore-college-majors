8152856,5,B000JSI7X0,"This is a phenomenal DVD for helping someone learn the Isshinryu karate system.  You should be going to a Karate school with a good sensei, but working on the katas is only about 10-15 minutes of each 1 hour class (at least at my dojo) and learning a series of 60+ complicated movements with constantly shifting stances (like a kata) in 10-15 minute weekly increments is a slow process.  It should be understood that every Isshinryu karate school will make some changes to the basic katas, so this video will not teach you how to do the katas exactly like your school is likely to do, but you'll find that for most Katas it'll be 90+% the same (at my school Chinto was the most different and it was still about 80-85% the same).  Also, the uses of each move is something your sensei will need to teach you, including using various bunkai to help you learn to use each move effectively, including getting your timing down (in my dojo various bunkais generally take up more than half of each class).

Using this DVD (and some other youtube sources that aren't nearly as good) I was able to progress from white belt to advanced brown belt (just short of black belt) in approximately a year.  To go from white belt to black belt generally takes 3 to 5 years and can take some people significantly longer.  I would learn each Kata as shown on the DVD and then I would learn how my school's kata was different and incorporate those changes.  Once I knew the basic kata, incorporating the minor changes was generally pretty easy.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.",1404000000,3,1565,4.524822695035461
8152857,5,B000JSI7X0,My daughter is a student of Mr. Reeves and we got this to supplement her karate classes.  The video is great with 8 different Kata's and shown from all different views.,1362873600,,168,4.419354838709677
8152858,3,B000JSI7X0,Dont use a video to learn karate.  it is a nice experience to watch an individual with such powerful and graceful movements.,1356480000,,124,4.636363636363637
8152859,5,B000JSI7X0,"I am currently a Green belt in Isshinryu Karate and spend many hours watching this DVD as I practice Katas at home. The quality of the video is excellent and I greatly appreciate the multiple angles for each Kata. Each Master might tweak the Kata somewhat but if you are looking for a great tool for practicing Katas at home, you would be wise to purchase this DVD for your library.

8152860,1,B000JSI7X0,I regret buying this DVD. the kata are not executed as they supposed to be.. this dvd sucks,1229558400,,91,4.111111111111111
8152861,5,B000JSI7X0,"I purchased this video to assist me with learning the isshinryu katas while practicing at home, and I'm very glad that I did.

It is helping me tremendously and I'm already seeing the improvements in my kata, and it's only the first day!

I'm impressed with the quality of the video. It is precise and to the point.

It shows each Isshinryu kata from the different views: front, back, side, and birdseye view. It also has an instructional section for each kata.",1188518400,19,461,4.597560975609756
