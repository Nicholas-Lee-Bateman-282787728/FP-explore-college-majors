5049494,3,B007232FTM,"It wasn't that bad of a B-Movie.  You have to remember in the 70's era - most martial art movies were too far fetched; jumping over buildings or jumping more than 2 stories high, of course including the sound effects which were out of sync.  The best part of this movie were the clips showing breasts which was typical of B-Movies at the time.",1417651200,,343,4.34375

5049498,1,B007232FTM,"This movie had plots which never developed, characters which had no substance; typically B movie. So if you are bored and want to watch a movie that has women as the action heroes, Savage Sisters might be for you.",1397865600,,213,4.487179487179487
5049499,2,B007232FTM,"i own most of the movies with sid haag, and this one is pretty mediocre. a great saturday afternoon i got nothing better to do movie. it has a few laughs and corny acting but not close to being the best of the genre. only for the die hard fans. you`ll do better with the big bird cage and the other flicks starring pam grier. buy this only if you get it cheap. otherwise watch it on amazon prime!",1390867200,,396,4.025316455696203
5049500,5,B007232FTM,"If you are Cheri fan you would like this movie. I thought it was pretty good, lots of action when trying to rebell against the gov. I seen this when frist out in movies. I think you would enjoy it.",1357516800,2,197,3.95
5049501,3,B007232FTM,"Savage Sisters is from '74 about a corrupt politican smuggling million dollars out of the banana republic.  it's an average exploitation film of it's time.  a young Sid Haig is in the film and Cheri Caffaro (known for her Ginger series).  Ms. Caffaro is looking her attractive best in this movie compared to some of her earlier works already mentioned.  The acting is cheezy, as it's more tongue-in-cheek drama than serious drama.  everyone seems to be having fun.  exploitation flicks of the 70s usually have a fair amount of nudity, and this one has none, though there are scene set-ups for them.  overall this isn't all that interesting or good.  it's mildly entertaining and paced good for an action movie.  if you're really into 70s exploitation, you might want to add this in your collection though you'll probably only view it once or twice.  not much for extra's and the packaging is pretty dreadful.  i believe this is a print on demand dvd from mgm.",1351814400,3,959,4.751515151515152

8508733,2,B007232FTM,"Almost exactly the silly little exploitation film you're expecting, except that the nudity is inexplicably implicit rather than right out on the screen. Sid Haig is brilliant, and John Ashley surprised me in a role that, for whatever reason, reminded me of a sleazy version of Glenn Campbell's character in True Girt. The three women at the center of the story don't have a single acting bone in their collective bodies, but then, that wasn't what they were hired for anyway. If you're in the mood for this kind of film, well, you could do a lot worse.",1465171200,2,552,4.642857142857143

8508735,1,B007232FTM,"I rented this because I remember watching quite a few women's prisoner pictures in the early 70's usually starting Pam Grier. Even though these pictures were admittedly cheesy , they were somewhat fun. Now this picture got a whole lot of actors who appeared in these Pam Grier films with the same background in the Phillipines but this picture was not nearly as much fun as those Pam Grier pictures. This one was very confusing and did not have the same tone as those other pictures. Also Gloria Henry who stars in this picture is no Pam Grier.",1464739200,,544,4.561224489795919

8508737,2,B007232FTM,"SAVAGE SISTERS is the brainchild of schlock / exploitation director, Eddie Romero (BEAST OF BLOOD, MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND, BRIDES OF BLOOD, BEAST OF THE YELLOW NIGHT), and stars Cheri Caffaro (THE ABDUCTORS) as tough-talking, Jo Turner, and Gloria Hendry (LIVE AND LET DIE) as the sadistic prison guard, Lynn Jackson. The story has something to do w/ a stolen case containing a million dollars. Of course, the plot is of minor importance, as Romero attempts to present us w/ a women-in-prison movie, combined w/ a crime caper film, full of blood, torture, and sexual perversion. This is done without any true nudity. Even during the shower and bathtub scenes! Several double-crosses, shootouts, explosions, and a jailbreak occur on cue, and we're off! Exploitation mega-god, Sid Haig (THE BIG DOLL HOUSE, THE BIG BIRD CAGE, COFFY, FOXY BROWN, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS) plays criminal mastermind, Malavasi. Toss in John Ashley (FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER, ATTACK OF THE EYE CREATURES, BRIDES OF BLOOD, MAD DOCTOR OF BLOOD ISLAND, etc.) as the slimy, W.P. Billingsly, and we've got ourselves a heavy duty cheeeze-log of the first magnitude! Unfortunately, it's also sort of dull. Roger Corman could have made this into a crackerjack fiesta! Romero seems unable to handle the subject matter. Worth watching only if you've seen all other such films...",1431388800,2,1366,5.1855203619909505

8508741,1,B007232FTM,"This movie is a steaming pile of puerile soft porn.  But that's OK, I didn't purchase it.  I ordered the movie next to it on the menu. Immediately after I hit the button, an emergency occurred and I was pulled away and did not get back for two days.  Too late, it seems, to be able to correct the issue.  Realizing this, I did watch the first 30 minutes.  What a misery of very large breasts, bad acting, terrible directing, racist attempts at ""hip"" blackness, and a script that could freeze time.  It WILL cause brain cancer.",1423353600,,526,4.371134020618556
