If I need an intense workout, dance workout or are short on time, Sara covers it all.  I loved the variations of movements offered by the assistants she had working out with her.  You can follow the person who is doing what you need that day!  I think a great workout dvd for all levels!  Can't wait for her next one!",1361577600,4,461,4.241379310344827
5381548,5,B00A46LBXA,I've been backpacking Mexico and Central America and have really been missing the gym.  I was so happy to receive Sara Haley's Sweat Unlimited.  All I need to sweat through her workouts is space for a yoga mat and a spot for my laptop.  The video has a number of different workouts ranging from 5-45 minutes that can be done on their own or in combination with each other.  My favorite is the 45 minute 'Sweat Box'.  It's nice to have a video with variety and workouts that can be completed with limited time.  Perfect for traveling or working out in the comfort of your own home.,1359849600,3,580,4.373831775700935
5381549,5,B00A46LBXA,"I was so excited to get ""Sweat Unlimited.""  I put it to use right away.  I love all the different options.  I work full time, and am I mom and being able to get in a 15 or 30 minute workout and still feel like I got something accomplished is great.  There is a workout for everyone and I think any age an ability can do this.  Sara makes the workouts fun and explains them well, so you know exactly what to do.  Great video!",1359590400,3,424,3.929411764705882
8546673,5,B00A46LBXA,"I didn't buy this here but was given it as a promo from a clothing company. I put off trying it out for a long time and am sorry I did. She is engaging, positive, and makes her workouts fast and interesting. I have only tried the Sweat Cardio, Sweat Box 45, and Sweat Extreme. I am closer to 60 than 50 and can keep up with most of this even taking on a lot of the advanced moves. I only break down to modification when doing moves that twist on my knees or those darned push ups way into a workout when I am getting depleted. I can do them like no one's business but only at the beginning before I'm getting tired  I am not sure if I will try any of the other workouts as they seem pretty short but the two long ones will be in my after gym routine from here on out.  I would like to see her make more DVD's as I can really get a good sweat going without feeling like I am going to die like a few others out there that just push too far for me.",1498780800,,945,3.7918781725888326

8546675,5,B00A46LBXA,"Thanks, Sara Haley, for a workout series that I can actually use!  I love the fact that I can choose which level to work out just by following a particular person and that I can change it up during the routine just by following a different person on screen.

I feel better and have more energy thanks to your video!",1399334400,,315,4.233333333333333
8546676,2,B00A46LBXA,"After viewing the dvd I was disappointed. Too much jumping and burpees, even some of the modifications were of no help.  Not a good workout for me, but it might be right for someone else.",1388880000,2,187,4.3428571428571425
8546677,5,B00A46LBXA,"This dvd is everything and more. Sara Haley is one of the most motivating trainers up to date. Nothing about this dvd is negative. One of the best things about Sara is she gives you options in every workout. Basically, you make your workout as easy as you want it or as hard as you want it. You make each workout fit for you and how you're feeling that day. You can choose to take it slow, or you can choose to sweat your butt off. Every part of your body is worked in the DVD and you will definitely feel it the next day! Take advantage of it and have fun! Highly recommend it.",1364428800,,578,4.034782608695652
8546678,5,B00A46LBXA,"i SAW HER ON TV DOING PART OF THE WORKOUT, AND IT LOOKED INTERESTING. I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU GET A VARIETY OF TIMES AND TYPES OF WORKOUTS - YOU ARE NOT LIMITED TO JUST ONE THING.",1363046400,,180,3.763157894736842
8546679,5,B00A46LBXA,"Sara's Sweat Unlimited DVD is fantastic. Each of the four workouts challenges the whole body, and she gives lots of great options to accomodate different levels. I am a working Mom with little time to go to the gym, and I wanted something that was both challenging and fun to do. Sara's time-based format is just perfect. I can choose a 5, 15, 30 or 45 minute workout depending on my schedule, and know that I will be getting a well-balanced, highly efficient workout each time. Her ""no excuses"" promise is spot-on. No equipment is needed, and these exercises can be done anywhere.  I especially love the mix of dance-inspired moves and strong core workouts. Sara is a brilliant instructor and you can tell she truly cares about providing safe and challenging workouts for her audience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone!",1362960000,2,824,4.7622377622377625
8546680,5,B00A46LBXA,"Sweat Unlimited is the solution to anyone's fitness plan.  I was very excited to be a part of the creation of this project because its unlike any other fitness video.  The options for the workout durations make it easy to fit into anyone's lifestyle.  Sara is an amazing motivator and always gives variations in intensity so viewers of all levels are ensured to have a fun, safe and effective workout program that they are able to stick with in order to achieve desired results.  Check it out...just pick your workout, press play, and let Sara be your coach to challenge you to take your workouts to the next level through these dynamic routines!",1361750400,,646,4.6902654867256635
8546681,5,B00A46LBXA,"This workout program works for me on so many levels.  A gym membership does not work for me right now for several reasons (cost, my little ones scream when left in the gym babysitting service, etc...).  Sara gives you so many options that you can go all week and do something different every day.  I can get my workout during nap time or even in the morning as the kids love to do the cardio dance workout with me so I can keep an eye on them at the same time!  I honestly don't focus much thought at all on fitness anymore but feel so much better after doing these workouts.  Not just because I get some exercise but because Sara's attitude is so uplifting and happy!",1361750400,4,668,4.228346456692913
8546682,5,B00A46LBXA,"Things I LOVE about this DVD

Each workout is a adapted to getting you to really target certain zones and work them OUT
The different options make you feel like there's always a workout that can fit into your schedule
The fun dance cardio is AMAZING - you don't even feel like you are working out yet you ARE
