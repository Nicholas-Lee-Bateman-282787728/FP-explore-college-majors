6365382,2,B00JK19VA0,"It takes you for a wonderful ride, as you are trying to figure out who and why, as we do with any other movie. The movie ends without given you a how or who or why. Big let down after what was such a promising movie, great action and suspense but no finish...so all of my ""I know who is doing it"" and all of the plots you may think are possible...is an empty end leaving the viewer with a simple...what? Mixed filling, great acting, great action, great suspense, they just forgot to write an ending...",1411776000,3,501,4.229166666666667

6365385,5,B00JK19VA0,"I loved ""The Last Passenger."" Note to marketing department--that stupid cover almost made me not rent it, and that would have been a shame, because while that cover makes it look like a typical noisy, busy, CGI-impregnated grade-B action movie, it's actually charming, low-key, tense, and entertaining as hell. I don't want to claim too much for it (what's that? too late, already have?), but I came to ""Passenger"" with very low expectations, and iwthin moments of seeing how the lead characters interacted, was totally won over. I actually cared that everyone was going to be all right. I liked the way characters changed in response to different circumstances. This was a lot of things that Hollywood-style movies are not, and key among them was well-written. There is a scene in which a middle-aged passenger assures the 7-year-old boy that it's OK to sit on purple because, far from being a ""girl's color,"" it is the hue of royalty, sat upon by kings, made from a dye extracted from a rare shell worth more than its weight in gold. It was just a moment, a flourish, but by such things, for me, hang a great movie-watching experience. I can't help thinking how many ""Last Passengers"" coud be made for the price of one gawd-awful Transformers movie.

In terms of storyline, there's not much novel here--you could stitch the plot together with bits and pieces from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unstoppable/dp/B004JOCU2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unstoppable</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taking-of-Pelham-One-Two-Three/dp/B000IZXXGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taking of Pelham One Two Three</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed/dp/B0012NO4WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport/dp/B002H7NFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport</a>. But that just provides the framework for the interactions and unlike less confident, bigger-budgeted movies, the context itself never tries to become the main draw. This is where the nostalgia comes in for me. ""Passenger,"" right down to the score, is a bit of throwback to earlier movies. But I found that fun.",1410480000,5,2274,6.407166123778501
6365386,2,B00JK19VA0,"Dougray Scott plays a recently widowed doctor Lewis Shaler, who hops on the last train out of London with his son Max (Joshua Kaynama). On the train he starts chatting with an attractive woman named Sarah Barwell (Kara Tointon). Obviously they are having a good time, despite noisy teenagers and a call from the hospital.

But the doctor notices something is wrong with this train. It fails to stop the right station. It continues to run. The passengers attempt to stop, using emergency brakes, but they just don't work. What happened to the train, or the driver?

That this UK film is low budget is not really a big problem. Directed by Omid Nooshin (his first feature), Last Passenger fails to thrill or entertain simply because it is too implausible. The train itself looks too outdated. Characters keep making silly decisions. The film itself, underwritten and half-baked, does not know what it wants to be. Speed? The Taking of Pelham One Two Three?

There are a few thrilling scenes in Last Passenger, I admit, but thats all. All in all repetitious and boring.",1403481600,2,1066,4.814207650273224
6365387,3,B00JK19VA0,"Dr. Lewis Shaler (Dougray Scott) is riding a late night London train with his seven year old son Max (Joshua Kaynama) Max is a bit rambunctious and through him he meets another passenger, the flirty Sarah (Kara Tointon). We get to know these characters as we watch others, especially a disagreeable young man (Iddo Goldberg) who catches everyone's attention. Soon the train has a problem which demands the remaining passengers take action. We then get to meet two elderly passengers (David Schofield, Elaine Middleton).

The passengers work together to confront the problem. We get to see character testing, character building, and some heroics. The acting was good. The plot and action was enough to hold my attention, but not enough to get excited over. Most films of this type have a subplot consisting of events that are taking place outside the train. This one does not. This is more of a concept film that keeps the viewer on the train.

A film you will forget shortly after you watch it.

6365389,4,B00JK19VA0,"Stylishly low budget, a great (albeit by the numbers) minimalist indie thriller. A fun ride to the end of line with an able cast (and what may be one of the most beautiful women ever in Kara Tointon)",1420416000,,199,4.2631578947368425
6365390,3,B00JK19VA0,"The mysterious trip gone wrong seems to have an attraction all its own , considering how many stories and movies use the premise. This story about a train ride gone awry is pretty typical but does a fair job of keeping the tension up. The older gentleman puzzled me with his attitude during the movie and the motive behind the runaway train wasn't explained but it was still entertaining.",1419465600,,388,4.63768115942029
6365391,5,B00JK19VA0,"This film is an amazing indie filmmaking attempt and first time director/writer job. I am a film director myself and having watch this film, know what kind of a limited budget they had, was amazed at how well the filmmakers created the whole experience of being in a speeding train. Aside from the technical aspects, this film isn't that great. What I mean is that if you're not a filmmaker but just a regular person looking to watch an entertaining film then this might not be for you. It's got the thrills and some mystery, but really it's not a great story. I would say everything about this film, weather it's the VFX or editing or cinematography, acting, sets etc are great! Some of them even better than some big budget Hollywood productions. What isn't great is the most fundamental thing of all the script and directing. It's not bad, just not good. Main problem I find with the way the film was directed is that it's as if the director treated each scene as a separate short film.",1419379200,2,989,4.5307262569832405

6365393,3,B00JK19VA0,Not my favorite -- although I love Dougray Scott. Slow and not always logical to my way of thinking.,1417737600,,100,4.315789473684211
6365394,5,B00JK19VA0,"Although it will not play in the US, I saw it on Netflix and it can't be beat for suspense..  Starts easy and builds up until you want to grab the person next to you and force them to fix it..  Sitting alone makes that rather hard..  Please consider it, as always American films leave NOTHING to the mystery, adding bit and pieces though out the movie to make you suspect the usual culprit..

Since there are no monsters to jump out at you...  This does the same thing with action!",1417651200,,481,4.241758241758242
6365395,4,B00JK19VA0,"This old-fashioned, straightforward British suspense film proves very satisfying.  It joins a rather proud tradition of action and/or mystery pictures set with the enclosed space of a train, ranging from The Lady Vanishes to Runaway Train.  This particular story unfolds one winter night on a late-night commuter rail from London.  Lewis (Dougray Scott), an emergency-room doctor and a widower, is traveling with his son (Joshua Kaynama).  His sleepy evening turns anxious when his stop rushes by, and the train does not stop.  He and four other travelers on the train realize a madman may be driving the speeding diesel-engine behemoth, and their journey may end in a fiery crush of steel if they cannot find a way to stop or escape from the train.

It is a simple popcorn-movie scenario, but one executed well, a few minor plot holes and instances of dodgy computer-generated imagery excepted.  A quiet first act with a generous amount of character development helps a great deal.  Scott, a one-time A-list hopeful whose career never entirely ignited (scheduling conflicts forced him to vacate role of Wolverine in the first X-Men film), is an understated, but charismatic lead, and he has genuine and sexy chemistry with Kara Tointon, nicely playing a friendly female passenger with whom Lewis flirts before the night turns into a fight for survival.  Despite a presumably modest budget, the set pieces, including a perilous bid to uncouple a section of cars, are exciting and realized with visual panache.  The film is simply fun.  A crisp, playful, unpretentious ride which never overplays its hand.  I would not be surprised one bit if U.S. studios recruited promising first-time director Omid Nooshin for a larger genre film in the future.",1417478400,,1746,5.109154929577465

8651608,2,B00JK19VA0,"All right - forget all the other bad movies out there; this dog IS terrible! Great editing, petty good acting - - other than those, it's jut awful. No plot, lots of cliches and predictability, loud noises that make no sense, idiotic dialogue, ridiculous, gratuitous, pointless drama leading nowhere.
I cannot ruin it for you: a Brit commuter train gets hijacked (but we never learn why). Very pretty woman chats up a weary doctor riding with his young boy. The boy has a toy dinosaur. Hmmmm, the train isn't stopping. Why was a man seen crawling alongside the tracks? What happened to the porter/guard person?? Hey, this door is locked!! The editing is superb - great cuts to frightened, startled faces, dashing, unstoppable train(s), screeching, sparking brakes, air pressure gauges that read '0'! Oh - - and we blow up a fire extinguisher in a deliberate fire. You know, the usual carbon dioxide ka-boom bomb! CO2!!
No sex, no bullets, no helicopters (though they appear in the art for the box), one magic trick (well, the same trick twice) - - and the hijacker, the bad guy? wears a helmet and won't look at you. Enjoy!",1492128000,,1122,4.729591836734694
