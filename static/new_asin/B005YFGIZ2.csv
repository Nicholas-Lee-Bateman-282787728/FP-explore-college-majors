4905763,5,B005YFGIZ2,"""Bag It!' is not doom and gloom, but rather encouraging and uplifting. The film is not preachy. It is not fatalistic. It is thoughtful and funny, while being informative and eye-opening. The film gives us all some easy things to do in order to help reduce our use of ""single use"" plastic containers. The soundtrack is really good too.",1327017600,,334,4.677966101694915
4905764,5,B005YFGIZ2,"Bag It has to be one of the better documentaries regarding the human footprint on the planet.  The focus is, of course, plastic, but plastic use is so ubiquitous that it deals with issues of sustainability, toxicity, energy consumption, recycling, the consumer culture, wildlife conservation, ocean health, landfills, and more.

In Bag It, you follow Jeb Berrier as he explores his role as a plastic consumer, and then the obstacles he faces as he attempts to decrease his plastic consumption.  It's a well designed, folksy film.  And it ends with suggestions on how the viewers (that's us) can reduce their consumption and disposal of plastics.  Oh, and that's both internal and external consumption - yuck!

It's hard to watch this film without wanting to do... something!  So go do it.",1322697600,6,788,5.015384615384615
4905765,5,B005YFGIZ2,"My 14 year old son had us watch this.  When I saw that it was over an hour long, I thought, ""Oh boy, what have I gotten myself into!""  But it was actually very well done and interesting as well as informative.  We watched it with our friends, and they liked it as well.  Since watching this documentary, our families have been working on reducing our use of plastic, especially plastic bags.  It's really sad to see what plastics are doing to the oceans and wildlife. Highly recommend watching!",1482796800,2,494,4.50561797752809
4905766,3,B005YFGIZ2,"""Bag It"" is informative and overall I enjoyed it. I deducted stars because 1) Jeb (the filmmaker) had some corny and some borderline inappropriate jokes that took away from the message and 2) I could have done without the childbirth scene at the end. The documentarist needs to stick with the information that is relevant to the subject matter.",1480636800,3,344,4.8474576271186445

4905770,5,B005YFGIZ2,This Movie changed my life! I recommend this movie to everyone. I was unaware of the dangers that chemicals posed and the effect of waste that I was contributing to the planet.

Contains a good amount of information on different types of plastic, the truth on recycling it and a bit on how we can limit our reliance on it. The Pacific Gyre (Garbage Patch) is alarming.

4905779,4,B005YFGIZ2,"A fair amount of decent research seems to have gone into this movie and the presentation of the information was clear and engaging. The only problem is that they weren't able to do a very good job of incorporating contradicting viewpoints for them to be able to make the case more fully because many of the people they wanted to interview for those viewpoints were unwilling to be video interviewed.
Overall though, this documentary moved me to consider more carefully my use and disposal of plastics, which was the main goal of the movie. Well done, ""Bag It"", you accomplished your goal.",1465516800,,588,4.7745098039215685

4905786,3,B005YFGIZ2,"The presentation of this documentary feels manufactured. I'm honestly not sure if Jeb Berrier is acting or not.

4905791,4,B005YFGIZ2,"The filmmaker worked hard to make the film entertaining, but his behavior sometimes annoyed the audience. The science in the movie reinforced my views on plastics, which I try to minimize in my life and utilize only when they are the best option. With a few edits, it would have been a five star review.",1437177600,,303,4.527272727272727

4905803,5,B005YFGIZ2,"I love this documentary, I can watch it over and over again. You always learn something new that you might not have caught the first time around. It is thought provoking and I find myself Goggling different topics from the movie. This in turn creates more questions, however good documentaries have a tendency to do that. The tone is light with some humor which makes it easier to take in the sometimes disturbing information. I highly recommend and look forward to more from Ray.",1425254400,,480,4.726190476190476

4905808,5,B005YFGIZ2,"A nice introduction to the problems of plastic. I watched it after reading several books on the topic, so there was nothing new, but it was entertaining and informative, and my partner (who hadn't read any books about it) was appropriately shocked, appalled, and inspired.",1419120000,,272,5.066666666666666
4905809,5,B005YFGIZ2,"Very well-done film about the effects of plastic on the environment and on our bodies. I show this in a university-level natural resource course each semester, and my students love it.",1419120000,,184,4.967741935483871

4905823,5,B005YFGIZ2,"Anderson starts out the film by saying how wonderful a substance plastic is.

4905824,4,B005YFGIZ2,This documentary was very informative. It definitely gives you a new perspective of your lifestyle. I have realized that the amount of things I buy is not necessary and this documentary has helped me to curb that.,1413849600,,213,4.783783783783784
4905825,4,B005YFGIZ2,Interesting for a documentary. Makes you think,1412726400,,46,5.714285714285714
4905826,5,B005YFGIZ2,"I liked his somewhat light-hearted attitude at the same time he was serious about this huge issue.  Wasn't the least bit boring or judgmental, just informative.  Covers more than just plastic bags.",1412640000,,197,5.125
4905827,5,B005YFGIZ2,"My son told me about this and asked me to watch it, I did, and the last few days since watching this documentary can only be described as conscious. When I put something away in the fridge, I try to choose a container I will use again. When I use a Ziplock I wash it out and put it away to be used again. I haven't forgotten my cloth and reusable plastic bags to use at the store. IKEA has some for .75 that fold up small enough to fit a couple or three in your purse or one in your pocket.  I did forget my car cup when I went for coffee and I felt bad about it, not just slightly remiss. I've been watching the recycle symbols on things I buy to make sure they have a 1 or 2. I will be writing to companies to ask them to make sure they are using those recyclables. I will also request they make large refill sizes for soap and the like. I'd use bar soap but it kills my skin.
This documentary is that eye opening. It will change how you think about everything you consume. Watch it and encourage others to as well, try not to be too obnoxious about it :).
All in all it was an easy film to watch, entertaining as well as informative. Dragged a bit towards the end but not so much I was wondering when it would be over.

I just wanted to update that we haven't purchased but one new box of plastic storage bags since we watched this, and they are for long term storage, and will used again. We still use plastic trash bags, as we don't see any way to do away with them and keep sanitary.
On a side note, since we have been using reusable containers our crisper and our meat keeper are much cleaner, and our produce keeps longer, our stuff in the freezer keeps better.  So not only does using single use bags hurt the environment, they cost you more money, as your food doesn't last as long.
Thanks for the documentary. Good stuff.",1410393600,6,1842,4.085635359116022

4905853,3,B005YFGIZ2,The filmmaker's tasteless jokes and limited scope detract from what is an important and interesting subject. I use it in high school as a small portion of the Human Impact Studies unit and try to inoculate my students to the aforementioned tasteless jokes (with limited success). Some of the more interesting aspects include what 'Big Plastic' (which is really 'Big Oil') is doing politically/economically to try and prevent any modulation or mitigation in the use of their products even at the local level. The fact that they gave the filmmaker the run around and ultimately refused to be interviewed for the documentary says a lot about where the industry's priorities are at.,1401494400,,678,5.0625

There was only one thing I didn't like in the documentary, and that was an unscientific experiment he ran that honestly could have had the potential to be extremely powerful if done differently/correctly.  This experiment was attempting to show the negative impact of all the body care products people use that are made out of chemicals and how they are absorbed into our body creating negative consequences to our physical health.

4905896,5,B005YFGIZ2,"The combination of a light touch and humor, real emotion (halfway into
filming the on-screen narrator finds he is going to have a baby, so
suddenly the issue involved gets much more personal), intelligent
presentation of facts without screaming in your ear or overstatement,
and the (sadly comic) attempts to be balanced and get the chemical
industry to go on the record add up to a much more enjoyable and
effective environmental documentary than most.

This is the kind of film that makes you want to change your own habits,
and believe you can make a difference, while never feeling like you're
sitting through a 'this is good for you' lecture. It reminded me of
Michael Moore's documentaries, in its playful tone about a serious
issue, but this has a lighter, less sarcastic, more lovable hand.

This would also be a terrific educational tool for 'tweens and teens
(there's probably a bit too much slightly, good naturedly ribald humor
for little kids, and some of the sad images of wildlife killed or
injured by plastics might be a bit upsetting for tots).

Kudos to all involved for this timely and important work that will
certainly effect my relationship to plastics in my world.",1363046400,11,1187,4.83743842364532

If it's convenient, she's for it -- unless of course it's destroying innocent living creatures and pushing endangered species like sea turtles and marine birds over the edge into extinction.

This movie gives the facts -- the eye-glazing numbers of bags, the tons of pollutants, the size and constituents of the plastic gyres whirling in the sea -- but it's the images that get you:  Nests full of the remains of dead seabirds -- feathers, bones and ... dozens of plastic bottlecaps.  The contents of the stomachs of dead whales -- enough plastic bags to take care of an afternoon's work in the checkout lane.  The miserable sight of sea turtles killing themselves by munching plastic bags that look enticingly like a delicious jellyfish -- the sea turtle's natural diet.

4905908,4,B005YFGIZ2,"I see that there are already 18 other reviews of this 78-minute film from 2010 posted so I'll try not to rehash the info already provided. This documentary starts out discussing the ""plastic bag"" and its impact on the environment but also covers plastics in general (packaging, baby bottles and toys, plastic lined cans, etc) and the need to recycle. The ""host"" is Jeb Berrier, a guy who looks and acts like Michael Moore. At first it looks like HE is the person who created the film as Director and writer, but you will see in the credits that the Director is Suzan Beraza and the writer is Michelle Curry Wright. (Neither is shown). So, honestly, I don't know if Berrier is telling his own story or if this is a ""plot device"" to present this important issue. But it works. And, later in the film Berrier turns from his Michael Moore mode to his Morgan Spurlock (""Super Size Me"") mode to try to eat as many foods containing Phalytes (sp?) as he can.

The interviews are with both environmentalists and authors of books on recycling. And the Director cleverly inserts scenes from TV shows and old movies. The soundtrack is great too. (I wonder if there is a soundtrack album, but I don't think so.)

The bonuses don't add a lot (and the six ""bonuses"" don't amount to much more than 10 minutes total). And, as you'd expect, the DVD is packaged in a recyclable foam cardboard package. This is good idea but, oddly, that package is enclosed in an additional slipcase (totally unnecessary), which will add to more trash. Go figure!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The most important aspect of watching a documentary such as this one, is to apply the information.
