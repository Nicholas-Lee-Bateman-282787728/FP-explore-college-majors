The only cons I can mention is that there's no way to lock up the first and second DVD, so they'll fall if you don't open it with caution.",1421625600,,413,3.9166666666666665
8581450,4,B00CFYASWY,"Overall I'm happy with my purchase as I was able to spend a few hours getting caught up on the ""Collective"" history while I worked from home a few days ago. Lots of interesting stuff that I never knew, since I've only very recently starting listening to The Ocean. The content and packaging is of very high quality (as expected from these guys).

My only complaint is that I would have loved to hear full samples from each of the albums they discussed throughout the history. There's a very long section discussion the various vocalists, vocal styles, musical styles, and such, but then they didn't play clips for each. A lot of the music clips were actually instrumental only, so it was difficult to understand why or how one vocalist was better or different than another.

I also would have loved if they waited to put this out until after the release of Pelagial since that's my favorite album by far. I would have been great to get some live clips of them playing the new material.",1389657600,2,985,4.559322033898305
8581451,5,B00CFYASWY,"If you are a fan of the ocean, then you absolutely must own this DVD set. I never expected this level of quantity OR quality, and am simply blown away. The documentary content on their history is fascinating, with lots of cool cameos from the likes of Mikael Akerfeldt and Brent Hinds. The story of Robin Staps and the collective is amazing to me. I haven't been the biggest fan of the most recent (and most stable) incarnation, but they've done a good job of selling me on Loic in particular.

The live footage is mind-blowing. Hours upon hours of top-notch performances with stellar audio to boot. This set is more than I ever could've anticipated. In classic Staps fashion, the packaging is incredible, and the content is even better.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS BAND, DON'T PASS ON THIS.",1388016000,2,822,4.662068965517242
