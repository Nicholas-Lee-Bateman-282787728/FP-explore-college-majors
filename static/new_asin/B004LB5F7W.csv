4401109,3,B004LB5F7W,I turned up the volume high and still had difficulty hearing all the songs. I thought also the costuming was lacking. I am comparing this performance of HMS Pinafore with the Dolly Cart performance in London. The performance of the Admiral was the best in this performance. He was quite short which added humor to his portrayal of higher rank in social order.,1358812800,,359,4.714285714285714
4401110,5,B004LB5F7W,"Although the audio was not up to par on occation, during the show, this is a great choice and the cast is endearing and talented! They knew their stuff on stage and this performance has become my favorite, absolutely! I applauded them with the audience, and the whole show is a back to the basics at its best, for anyone longing to see a well done community performance, but like me, can't just jump in the car and go to the nearest theater, because it is only rare occations, when such opportunities arise, IF EVER! Don't be put off by the unfortunate level of audio that does resolve enough to hear the songs and spoken lines, or the simple sets, which are still a level five star, in my opinion! See this and get the feel of the original Gilbert and Sulivan that has been and always will be the best show in town! Five stars because they really pull it off here! Thankful for the blessings of stage plays at unBollywooded and real! Yeah and hats off to the entire production and their performers and orcastra! Glad I dared watch and I have to have a dvd of this one! Don't miss out! You need this! Call it vitimin JOY! For that is what this show is! Pure and simple, with a smile of satisfaction to last a while. Blessings! Thanks for readin'!",1344729600,,1246,4.329059829059829
4401111,1,B004LB5F7W,"If I could have given this a minus 2 stars, I would have. Watched less than 15 minutes for a rental fee of 2.99. Terrible sound quality unless all you want to hear is the orchestra. The high note, if there was one, was an acknowledgement of all members of the orchestra.",1339718400,3,270,4.211538461538462
4401112,4,B004LB5F7W,"I had never even heard of this before catching it on PBS last month. As a previous reviewer mentioned, some of the songs are a little hard to understand, but to be fair, you have to understand it is a play, not a movie. I had no problems understanding the story, even if I missed one out of every ten words, just as I would have if I'd been in the audience. The plot was hilarious and the actors so much fun to watch. I am definitely looking for a dvd to own.",1320364800,3,459,3.946236559139785
4401113,1,B004LB5F7W,"This DVD should have never been released.  Buy it only if:

1.  You have memorized the lyrics to Pinafore
2.  You are adept at lip reading
3.  You like to listen to songs sung in the distance

Apparently the actors are not miked, and the sound engineer was asleep at the switch.  The chorus comes through loud and clear, but individual actors are quite muffled and indistinct.  Patter is impossible, and what is G&S without patter?",1315958400,10,431,4.578947368421052
4401114,1,B004LB5F7W,"Hard to express how disappointing this was.  I wanted to introduce this great piece to my children and they just hated it.  Only because I love the show and know it well was I able to understand any of the lyrics.  It's really a home video of what was probably a very good amateur production, but it's not worthy of sale or rental but to the members of the cast.",1454630400,,362,4.142857142857143
4401115,2,B004LB5F7W,Would be OK but lousy production quality,1444953600,,40,4.857142857142857
4401116,2,B004LB5F7W,"I have seen this opera live, and this production isn't very well produced.  I think that seeing it live is the best option.",1438387200,,123,4.3478260869565215
4401117,3,B004LB5F7W,Although a delightful production in many ways they could have benefited greatly by miking the soloists.,1436140800,,103,5.5
4401118,5,B004LB5F7W,Great show - really unique,1432339200,,26,4.4
4401119,2,B004LB5F7W,"Audio is poor. Production is good, but the distent microphone kills it.",1426723200,,71,5.0
4401120,1,B004LB5F7W,Absolutely awful for a performsnce for which you charge money!,1418428800,,62,5.3
4401121,2,B004LB5F7W,"This is a fantastic piece and had a fantastic cast.  However, it was a one-camera version of a student play, so the sound was uneven and it was difficult to hear a lot of the dialog.  Just know that it's not a professional production.  The lights wash out the face and some of it's hard to hear, but it is the old favorite songs anyway, and much of it well-sung.",1379116800,,362,4.142857142857143
4401122,1,B004LB5F7W,Like watching a high school production videotaped by somebody's mom sitting in the back of the auditorium. This is a real dog... too bad I can't give it zero stars,1370044800,,163,4.466666666666667
4401123,1,B004LB5F7W,I really love Pinafore and wanted my own copy.  Wish I had saved my money and bought a better quality copy.,1359244800,,107,4.095238095238095
8434188,2,B004LB5F7W,"It's like someone snuck into the balcony and secretly recorded it. Sound is bad, and the picture is not great either.",1494806400,,117,4.619047619047619
8434189,1,B004LB5F7W,This has poor production values for watching on screen and we found the sound muddy. For us we stopped watching after 10 min.,1481328000,,125,4.478260869565218
8434190,2,B004LB5F7W,"Hmm. My complaint with this movie is with the description in the catalog. I rented it expecting a professionally produced theater production after  reading the description. I won't say that it was misleading or false, but the show is definitely amateur. If you rent or purchase expecting a community theater production, you won't be disappointed.",1478736000,,346,5.290909090909091
8434191,4,B004LB5F7W,"I used excerpts of this production for a theatre class I teach.  I understood what it was after reading the comments.  I was delighted to see such a vibrant cast and such a nice set.  There were a few times the audio quality was less than desirable.  However, they nicely captured asides, cheeky humour, British sensibilities of the victorian era and great satirical moments!  It gave us a lot to talk about. Possible other stagings, could this be performed in a modern way? What problems in the story relate to now?  It was great for my students to see people that are more accessible (look more like them) enjoying acting.  They did note some of the problems and we were able to discuss the differences in directing style and why possibly they might have made the audio choices that they did.  It was a very good teaching tool!",1475020800,,829,4.554054054054054
8434192,2,B004LB5F7W,It looks like a recording of a college stage production.  The dancing and costuming are uninspired.  The sound is muddy.  I could not make out what anyone was saying or singing.  After about 20 minutes a gave up and found a superior production of HMS Pinafore on YouTube.,1473984000,,271,4.583333333333333
8434193,1,B004LB5F7W,"This is community theater from Madison, Wisconsin, a pleasant attempt but by no means professional.  The orchestra is quite good, the singers fair, but the recording and video range from poor to amateurish.  Most of the video is from afar and it sounds like there was one mic at a distance; very indistinct. It should not be on Amazon.",1472256000,,335,4.661016949152542
8434194,1,B004LB5F7W,The sound is terrible. You just can't understand the dialog or lyrics.  If it had subtitles it would get three stars.,1467849600,,117,4.571428571428571
8434195,1,B004LB5F7W,"Very poor audio and video quality, photography and lighting like an amateur. Costumes, props and singing seemed good, but there was so much distortion in the ""tape sound"" that many words were lost on my high-end hifi system.",1467072000,,224,4.921052631578948
8434196,2,B004LB5F7W,Ordered it without reading the other reviews. It's in standard def and it's a recording of a stage production. If I had someone in it I'd watch but otherwise not what I was looking for.,1463184000,,185,4.314285714285714
8434197,5,B004LB5F7W,ok,1461196800,,2,2.0
