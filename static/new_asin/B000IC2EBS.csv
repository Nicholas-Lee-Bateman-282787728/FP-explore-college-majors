8144731,3,B000IC2EBS,"I got this for my daughter, a serious sushi fan, and while there is nothing wrong with the instructions, per say, it is rather bland watching even for an instructional video. Although we did learn a couple of new tricks, so I won't complain too too much.",1451692800,,254,4.425531914893617
8144732,2,B000IC2EBS,This video moves at such a slow pace I barely made it through the first 15 minutes.  After finishing the video I felt like I had wasted my time.  The video does help a bit but you should spend your money elsewhere.  I recommend a video called Ken Sushi.  This video will be of much more help.,1184544000,2,292,4.0701754385964914
