Perfect for young children
Would love additional dvd's if
They exist",1457395200,,84,5.071428571428571

8167205,2,B000FIHN7A,I was disappointed. The picture was the same picture as the record and book we had in the 1940's. But the DVD and the story weren't at all the same.  I was hoping to send the wonderful song and story to my great grandson but it is just not to be.  Awful storyline and terrible music.  I will try again to get the original.,1213315200,4,322,4.0
8167206,5,B000FIHN7A,"Little Toot.  What can I say?  My brother and I used to watch this all the time as kids and I can't believe we turned out relatively normal.  There's this really psychadelic scene with a song that will rob you of your sanity (percy's perfect purple pickled pelican pellets).  I swear the people who made that part of the movie were on so many drugs it's unbelieveable.  BUY THIS DVD BUY THIS DVD BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY IT'S HILLARIOUS!!!!  It's also got a great message.  If you are a father to two puppies and stranded in a typhoon in the middle of the ocean, the best thing to do is stay in your boat likely to drown as you cast your pups off into a getaway row boat.  Odds are, they're likely to end up at the nearest port and find a magical bubblegum loving tugboat who will come and find you and reunite you with your children.  Just be sure you don't wash up on the shore of a volcanic island.

If you are a parent, buy this movie for your kids to watch.  They will ove it and want to watch it again and again, and hopefully they'll not be freaked out by the pelican song.

If you are a drug addict, yet are willing to spend your money on other things, then buy this dvd.  Watch the pelican song in the third chapter, and prepare for the trip of your life.

Enjoy",1174176000,3,1267,4.139344262295082
