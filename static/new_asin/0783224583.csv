52771,5,0783224583,"Phantom Lady is a solid detective/true crime movie. This reviewer hesitates to label it noir due to some rather strange structural attributes. The film opens as a lonely and unhappy Alan Curtis meets a lonely and unhappy woman (Ann Terry), in a bar and impulsively asks her to a play. Soon afterward, she dumps him and goes to her apartment. Curtis arrives at his own home to find the cops waiting! His wife has been strangled and he is the suspect. (Husbands always are). When Curtis cannot establish an alibi, he is quickly convicted and sent to prison. The elusive Terry becomes the Phantom Lady. Curtis has 2 factors working for him: One is the lead detective, Thomas Gomez, who believes Curtis' story. The other is his devoted secretary Ella Raines. Here is the most loyal employee ever seen on screen! She is determined to track down witnesses, especially Terry, who can spring her boss. Viewers are perfectly aware that Raines loyalty is well placed! They know the alibis are valid! As noted above, there are 2 main defects: One is that that the actual murderer tips his/her hand to the observant. The other is that PL was OBVIOUSLY filmed in a studio and not on a big city location. This greatly lessens the noir effect of night shots, dark streets, high heels on lonely sidewalks, shadows, gloomy bars and all the standard tricks of the trade. Furthermore that scene on the elevated subway platform is almost comical! Who was the director kidding? That was an insult to all the subways of the world, especially New York's. This is why this reviewer urges viewers to forget the noir aspects of PL and concentrate on the searches for the real killer and Terry. Despite the aforementioned tipped hand, this is still a great mystery. Whodunit? Does Raines find the phantom? This reviewer does not give away endings. The curious will have to watch for themselves. Suffice to say, Raines carries PL virtually single-handed. This is her flick! PL is highly recommended to police/detective aficionados. As a treat, and a test, try to spot the cameo by the veteran actor Milburn Stone. He later played Doc in the long running Gunsmoke TV series. If you catch him, give yourself a gold star. And pay attention to what the ladies are wearing! Fashion matters!",1088985600,8,2257,4.774936061381074

52773,4,0783224583,"Rainy streets, late nights, and a shadowy, moody aura prevails in the film noir from the 1940s.  If you enjoy this genre, this film will deliver for you.  Ella Raines plays a secretary from Kansas in love with her boss, a New York civil engineer, played by Alan Curtis. When he is falsely accused of murdering his wife, she sets out with determination to clear his name.
  Throughout the film we are given hints as to who is the real murderer.  We follow Raines as she reconstructs the activities of the fateful night and encounters characters who deny seeing a woman with Curtis.  This witness could provide an alibi.
  The twists and turns of the plot will keep you interested, as Raines unravels the mystery to find a happy ending.  Recommended as a fine example of film noir.",1074643200,5,779,4.586956521739131
52774,4,0783224583,"Cornell Woolrich is the unsung hero of this and many other films. His little stories bashed out at a tremendous speed simply make great films. Hitchcock used Rear Window to create one of his best films. Other directors have used his stories to great effect. The recent Original Sin is the latest in a very long and distinguished list.
With a great story line of a man sitting on death row while his friends race to find evidence of his innocence, Siodmak really produces the goods in this film. One sequence, in particular, the jazz jam session, is as close to a sex scene as film makers could go in those days. The scene alone puts this film in the master class. Great cinematography, some good acting and briliant direction add up to one of the best film noirs in circulation.",1057276800,14,778,4.524822695035461
52775,5,0783224583,"""Phantom Lady"" falls into the tradition of great forties' noir films beginning with ""The Maltese Falcon.""  German emigre director Robert Siodmak, who gave us two Burt Lancaster noir gems with ""The Killers"" and ""Crisscross,"" executed a deft hand and used the camera to compelling advantage in displaying confinement on the one hand and closeups of characters immersed in states of great tension on the other.
Cornell Woolrich was a master storyteller of New York tales about people trapped within the clutches of the big city, battling tenaciously for survival.  Woolrich gave us perhaps the number one voyeuristic film in cinema annals with Hitchcock's ""Rear Window.""  His story thrust of ""Phantom Lady"" is one of a crafty and elegantly beautiful woman's determined efforts to prove that the man she loves is innocent of the charge of murder, for which he has been tried and convicted.  Ella Raines operates with burning conviction and speedy determination as she battles the clock, which is ticking down toward the murder execution of the man she loves, played by Alan Curtis.
The ""phantom lady"" of the title is Fay Helm, who meets Curtis at a Manhattan bar.  He is distraught over a wrong turn in his marriage and quickly learns that she is even more forlorn than himself.  Curtis has an extra ticket to a hit Broadway musical and he is able to finally entice her to attend it with him.  After that they part.  When he returns to his apartment the police are there, revealing that Curtis's wife has been murdered by strangulation.
For a while the film shapes up as a grand mystery as Raines continues searching frantically for Helm, who can account for Curtis's time while his wife was being murdered, but eventually it shapes up as a microscopic look at a brilliant, megalomaniacal killer when Franchot Tone turns up.  A famous sculptor who has worked with Curtis, who is an architectural engineer, Tone masquerades as a friend of Curtis's who is actually planning to stand by and let him be executed for a crime Tone committed.  One of the most interesting scenes of the film is the psychological banter between Tone and the investigating police officer who explains that psychologically disturbed people commit the kinds of murders as that visited upon Curtis's wife.  An edgy Tone insists that normal people commit such crimes, people who are pushed to the brink of frustration.
Tone was never better.  The camera closes in for brilliantly revealing shots of a man immersed in desperation.  Revealing closeups also demonstrate the frustration and frequent despair of Curtis as a man falsely convicted and close to execution for a crime he never committed and the determination of Raines, who never looked more beautiful, as she fights to save the life of the man she loves.",1027900800,15,2779,4.937768240343348
52776,4,0783224583,"Not the best known of grim film noirs of the Forties, but one of the best.  Ella Raines is very impressive as a woman who risks all to prove her employer is innocent of the murder for which he has been convicted.  Her assuming of false personas (which may even briefly fool the audience) make it surprising that her performance in this film is not better known.  The purely visual sexual suggestiveness in the jazz joint scene with Elisha Cook is hot stuff, and you will be amazed that Hollywood could have gotten away with it in the Forties.  The excellent photography (black & white, of course) captures that grim urban atmosphere perfectly.  Anyone who tries to colorize this film should be punished!  The climactic revelation is highly suspenseful, and the happy ending is quite atypical of such films.  Don't miss this one.",979430400,25,828,4.748251748251748
52777,4,0783224583,"Phantom Lady may have been overshadowed in 1944 by the release of the two classic noir films; Double Indemnity and Laura, yet Robert Siodmak's psychological thriller still maintains an acknowledged position among the  genre. Siodmak lures viewers through rain slicked streets, back alley jazz  clubs, and post midnight rendezvous.  Adapted from a Cornell Woolrich  novel, Phantom Lady is similar to Wollrich's later work Black Angel, in  that a man (Alan Curtis) is wrongfully accused of murder, sentenced to  death and can only depend on his secretary ( Ella Raines) who desperately  searches for the only alibi (the phantom lady) that can exonerate him.  Franchot Tone recieves top billing as a psychopathic socialite with  twitching hands, but it is twenty-three year old Ella Raines who deservedly  steals the spotlight .  As Carol ""Kansas"" Richman, she seduces  simple minded Elisha Cook Jr., an orchestra drummer, during one of his  performances.  In a classic cat & mouse sequence, she trails an  uncooperative bartender through Siodmak's darkened urban landscape. The  sequence is highlighted with images and sounds of elevated subway cars,  city taxi cabs, and amplified footsteps against wet black-tops. Siodmak  created a five minute symphonic masterpiece that captured the essence of  urban trepidation.  The other eighty-two minutes should also please most  noir aficionados.",961200000,52,1388,5.514285714285714

52811,2,0783224583,"I've always had a love affair with Ella Raines since first seeing her in Hail the Conquering Hero, and this movie may have been her best vehicle for showing off both her talent and beauty. But despite having many successful aspects of the film noir style, the movie never caught on and was pretty much panned by critics. The principle problem was that the script had a plot hole in it you could have driven an ocean liner through! The hero's problem was that he had to provide an alibi to prove that he didn't kill his wife after earlier having a quarrel with her. He goes to a bar, meets a woman who agrees to accompany him to a musical show without revealing her name, then disappears. When he persuades the police to accompany him while retracing his steps of that night, a bartender, a taxi driver, and a drummer and a singer at the show all state that they indeed saw him but not the woman. Because of this he is brought to trial, convicted and sentenced to death. The hole in the plot here is both simple and obvious. The various witnesses all prove that he was elsewhere when his wife was killed, whether he was with a woman or not! He hardly needs any 'phantom lady' to prove this, and no self-respecting policeman or DA would would have charged him given his solid alibi, let alone taken him to trial. This unfortunately serves to invalidate the entire rest of the movie.

The shame is that it didn't have to be that way, and one wonders if the original story from which the movie script was taken had avoided the absurdity of the plot's logic. It turned out that the real killer had bribed the various witnesses to say that the hero was not accompanied by a woman, when all that had to happen was for him to bribe them to say that they had never seen the husband instead and thus could not corroborate his alibi. The movie could then have proceeded from there as it did, since that way the phantom lady indeed became crucial to the hero's alibi. Yet for some reason this obvious solution was ignored, with the total loss of logic betraying the entire concept of the movie. Coupled with other lapses - Raines pursues the bartender, the drummer and the singer, and even the phantom lady, but never confronts the readily identified taxi driver; the killer after murdering the wife is somehow able to find the husband miles away from the scene of the crime and then after following him successfully bribes all 4 witnesses to remain silent even in the face of a police investigation of a murder - the script's illogic simply let Ella and her subsequent wildly entertaining performance as amateur sleuth down. One star for the absurdity of this major plot hole, but a second added for the lovely Ella!",1460764800,,2705,4.486815415821501
52812,4,0783224583,"A classic movie given a good treatment on DVD, Phantom Lady stretches reality to odd proportions in grand film noir style. Star Ella Raines' eyes seem to sparkle, an effect I still remember from the first time I saw this at a revival showing over three decades ago. She appears beyond human at times, with an amazing look, perfectly styled hair and stunning period clothes. This movie instantly became one of my favorites. I do wish more restoration would be done. The image has minor flaws. There's so much good here. Check out Ms. Raines wardrobe and character changes. See the always good Elisha Cook's amazing drumming scene, when he takes Ms. Raines, in disguise, to an after hours jazz spot. If this movie had kept its brilliance and unique qualities going through its whole, we'd have one of the great classics of the era. Even so, this movie shows its power and influence, which stand up even to this day. The styles in Ridley Scott's Bladerunner remind me of Phantom Lady. I suggest watching Phantom Lady and then re-watching Bladerunner for an interesting perspective on some of the history of film noir. This DVD could look better, but it requires viewing, if only to see one of the most unique films of the noir period and looking very good.",1458432000,2,1253,4.7
52813,4,0783224583,"The Film Noir Foundation and the American Film Institute Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland sponsor an annual festival of film noir called Noir City DC which I look forward to attending every year. The Film Noir Foundation is a non-profit corporation  "" created as an educational resource regarding the cultural, historical, and artistic significance of film noir as an original American cinematic movement.""  The AFI describes its mission as  fulfilling "" America's promise to preserve the heritage of the motion picture, to honor the artists and their work and to educate the next generation of storytellers.""  This year's Noir City DC program included several film adaptations of writings by Cornell Woolrich (1903 -- 1968). Woolrich was a prolific writer who had more of his works made into noir films than any other author.  This year's festival included the Woolrich-based films, "" Night has a Thousand Eyes""  ""The Guilty"", ""Don't Open that Door"" and ""If I Should Die Before I Wake"", ""Street of Chance"", ""Black Angel"",  ""No Man of her Own"", and, the film I am reviewing here, ""Phantom Lady"", released in 1944 and based upon Woolrich's 1942 novel of the same name written under the pseudonym William Irish.

Directed by the important director of film noir Robert Siodmak, ""Phantom Lady"" tells the story of Scott Henderson, (Alan Curtis) who is wrongly accused and convicted of the murder of his estranged wife. He is saved from execution through the loyalty and efforts of his secretary, Carol Richman, known as ""Kansas"" (Ella Raines).  Scott has an alibi in that on the night of the murder he met a mysterious woman at a bar, the ""phantom lady"" and took her to the theater. But the phantom lady cannot be found and witnesses deny that they saw Scott in her presence.

The plot of the film raises many questions. The importance of the phantom lady is unclear because Scott's presence in the bar, the theater, and in a taxi were substantiated irrespective of the phantom lady.  Be that as it may, Scott was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. The strength of the movie lies in its atmosphere and characterizations more than in its story line. The black-and-white cinematography features shady, rainy streets, lonely subway stops, and bars frequented by the lost and the brokenhearted.  The movie gives a noir feeling of loneliness. In the strongest scene in the film, a wild jazz musician beats furiously and orgiastically upon his drum in a scene emblematic of sexuality and of the underside of city life. Ella Raines offers a convincing portrayal of Kansas as she becomes a ""hep chick"" to save her man, and Franchot Tome offers a threatening, smoldering performance of the mad killer (his identity is revealed early in the film).

I was grateful for the opportunity to see ""Phantom Lady"" on a large screen in a beautiful theater as part of Noir City DC and to get to learn more about Cornell Woolrich and some of the other film adaptations of his work. Foster Hirsch, a scholar of film noir and a director of the Film Noir Foundation, offered an insightful introduction to the film which discussed its history and reception, the actors, and the sources of the outstanding cinematography in German expressivism.

52818,4,0783224583,"""Phantom Lady"" (1944) was directed by Robert Siodmak, renowned for his considerable oeuvre of thrillers, based on the novel of the same name by Cornell Woolrich, known for his pulpy ""noir"" crime novels. Upon realizing that his marriage has crumbled, Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) spends his anniversary drowning his sorrows in a bar. He meets a woman (Fay Helm) there who seems similarly adrift. He invites her to the show he intended to take his wife to. After the show, the lady departs, saying that it's better if she doesn't give him her name. Upon returning to his apartment, Henderson is met by police officers who inform him his wife has been murdered, strangled with his tie. When Henderson tries to provide an alibi, everyone remembers him but no one remembers the mystery woman, who was wearing a distinctive feathered hat. When he's convicted of murder, Henderson's faithful secretary Carol Richman (Ella Raines) and the investigating police Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez), convinced of his innocence, try to find the phantom lady.

With such great crime film talent at the helm, one might expect a great film. ""Phantom Lady"" has moments of brilliance, but it is stymied by a particularly daft plot that can't support much substance. The point of the all the action is to find the woman in the funny hat. But it is never clear why she would matter to Henderson's alibi. The prosecution claims that he had time to murder his wife before turning up at the bar. It sounds like the DA got the time of the murder wrong. How does the ""phantom lady""s presence refute that? But, there is a surprise for the audience in regards to the villain. And the underground jazz club scenes, where Richman tries to ply information from a drummer named Cliff (Elisha Cook, Jr.) are fantastic. Carol Richman's role is in the mold of noir ""helper heroines"". She's level-headed, not prone to angst or panic, tireless, and tries to pull Henderson out of his understandable gloom. But, rather than helping, she drives the investigation and the narrative, as Henderson is stuck behind bars. It's an unusual twist on 1940s crime films.

52843,5,0783224583,"The movie is all about modernism, right up until its very last seconds when Ella Raines is at the other end of a dictaphone with a cord so long and shiny it looks like an octopus' tentacle, and the dictaphone keeps repeating the phrase, ""Every night....  Every night...""  Any viewer will spot the numerous references filmmaker Siodmak makes to the modernist movement, from the huge number of technological inventions, to the attitude of the characters, even to the assertion of the primacy of the artist.  It seems there are two sorts of artist, one is the decent kind embodied by Alan Curtis' character ""Scott,"" an engineer interested in helping the poor.  Then there is the sculptor Jack Marlowe, Scott's best friend, played by Franchot Tone, once the husband of Joan Crawford.  Marlowe builds huge abstracted heads for public spaces, and we get to see several maquettes of them lying around his apartment, each one more crazy than the last.  The set designers must have loved the Jack Marlowe character, his whole apartment is a modernist dream, there's even the famous self-portrait of Van Gogh with the bandage wrapping where his right ear once lived, hanging on the wall as if to say, ""Artists are crazy mofos.""  It's New York and nearly everyone's an artist--the modiste, ""Kettisha,"" who makes you an original hat (out of forty dead birds)--the matronly doctor who treats you when your fiance dies and you crack up on the floor with his clothes around you like the children you never had.  Then there's a whole Broadway show, from the start of its run to the closing party.

The famous jazz sequence with Elisha Cook Jr plays this out in another way, but oh my, what a roller coaster ride that scene is!  It's designed to make you think that Ella Raines is so desperate that she'll actually have sex with Cook just to get him to spill what he knows, and the actress makes herself look totally trashy and sexy, jiving to the beat, enthralled to the music, with what looks like herky-jerky cuts of a handheld camera eying her long body up and down.  The truth is, she's too much woman for little Elisha Cook Jr, and he knows it.  He takes her home and, well, it's all over before he begins.  An incredibly tight sequence that will have your eyes bugging out.  Meanwhile America's greatest actor, Thomas Gomez, does what he can with a somewhat underwritten part, as Inspector Burgess, a man as in love with his victim as is Ella Raines herself.  Cops are, in general, worse than the crooks in noir movies, and this one's no exception, except for Burgess who stands out from his squad by virtue of his big sad puppy dog eyes hoping to bring one last smile from Scott.

Meanwhile Franchot Tone's monologue about how hands can do wonderful things, but hand scan also do horrible things (his own hands acting out each new example like two floating puppets disconnected from his own body) shows that someone was reading Sherwood Anderson's WINESBURG, OHIO at Universal in the Siodmak Unit....

The picture moves briskly--maybe too briskly, I would have loved to see more of implacable ""Kansas"" stalking that bartender, make him really squirm with her cold, appraising eyes.  It's funny, Lauren Bacall gets all the acclaim, but she never did anything in her life that was anywhere near what Ella Raines does in this movie.",1326412800,3,3320,4.7443478260869565

52845,3,0783224583,"I found this film noir to be odd in that the beginning and the end were both lousy but the longer middle part was excellent. The ""lousy"" parts are such because they drag on and are simply boring when they don't have to be.

The immediate opening scenes are fine, showing an innocent man, ""Scott Henderson"" (Alan Curtis) being charged and found guilty of a murder he didn't commit....but then almost nothing happens for the next 20 minutes.

Then comes the good part when Henderson's secretary ""Carol 'Kansas' Richmond"" (Ella Raines) gets involved, taking it upon herself to find the missing woman who could prove that her boss was innocent. During her pursuit we meet a couple of very interesting characters and we see some outstanding film-noir photography.

The most interesting character, ""Cliff,"" was played by film noir regular Elisha Cook Jr. He has one scene in which he takes Raines to a local warehouse-type room where his jazz band is practicing. Cook then shows off with this drum playing and it is so frenetic, so bizarre that it is almost shocking to watch. You have to see it, to appreciate it. It's a small, insignificant scene but very memorable. A few other minor characters are a bit strange, too.

Thomas Gomez plays a cop (""Inspector Burgess"") who winds up helping Raines a bit, and he's good to watch, too. In the end, Raines discovers what's up and is in peril herself. That scene has suspense but is too drawn out. It's like, ""okay, already.....let's get on with it!""",1239062400,,1490,4.741312741312742

He offers to share his theatre tickets with a woman wearing a very distinctive hat played by Fay Helm, he met at the bar.  She, also obviously upset, agrees provided that they remain nameless to each other.  They depart after enjoying the show.

When Curtis arrives home he's met by a group of detectives owing to the fact that Curtis' wife Marcella has been found strangled.  Chief inspector Burgess played by talented supporting actor Thomas Gomez cannot corroborate Curtis' alibi as all witnesses remember Curtis but have no recollection of the woman accompanying him.

Curtis soon stands trial and the preponderence of circumstantial evidence against him leads to a speedy murder conviction. Curtis' assistant Carol Richman played by Ella Raines, who is deeply in love with him, cannot stand idly by and commences her own investigation.  She is soon joined by the sympathetic Gomez who is convinced that Curtis is innocent.

Curtis' best friend sculptor Jack Marlowe played by Francot Tone shows up after returning from South America.  Displaying erratic psychotic tendencies we learn that he's been bribing witnesses to be silent.  One by one however he's been murdering them to protect himself.

Raines is persistent and finally tracks down the girl with the unusual hat but Tone is wise to her intentions and intends to silence her as well.",1138492800,2,1818,5.101351351351352

7790250,5,0783224583,"This is a very riveting film noir and a splendid mystery. A film noir is a crime drama with a cynical attitude where the protagonist is not the detective, but a victim, suspect, or, as in this case, the perpetrator of the crime. The perpetrator is often self-destructive or, as in this film, crazy. The genre was used in the early 1940s to the late 1950s.
This engrossing example of the genre was one of the first. It is a black and white film of 1944. A man is framed for the murder of his wife. He was with a woman who he met at a bar where he went when he and his wife had an argument. The woman he met was clearly depressed. She was wearing a strange large unforgettable hat. She could have given him an alibi but no one who clearly saw the husband and this woman together claims they saw him, and insisted that he was not with a woman. He cannot tell the police her name or address because when he was with her, she refused to give him this information.
It is unclear why the barman, drummer, and performer, all of whom stared at the woman when the man was with her, say they never saw her. The mans employee, a woman who is in love with him, refuses to give up. She does all she can to save his life. He is to be executed in 18 days.",1497225600,2,1239,4.040650406504065
7790251,4,0783224583,"""The Phantom Lady"" is a better than average noir effort from the 1940's, largely due to memorable performances from Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Elisha Cook, jr.  The movie was the first American thriller directed by Robert Siodmak, who brought a touch of German expressionism, resulting in a few remarkable camera shots.  The producer was Joan Harrison, best known as a scriptwriter for Hitchcock.

Ella Raines is Carol ---affectionately known as ""Kansas"", the spunky secretary to engineer Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis).  Raines, though she carries the film as an actress, doesn't appear until it has already been established that her boss has been framed for the murder of his wife, on their anniversary, when he is consoling himself by attending a musical revue with a strange woman (the ""phantom lady"") he met at a bar.  The woman's hat, which also matches that of the revue's leading performer, becomes an integral ""McGuffin""  in the plot.

Raines, who slightly resembles Gene Tierney, shows wit and determination as she sets out to find the real murderer, shifting from secretary to detective.  Acting on advice from a police inspector, she also attends a performance of the revue.  Here, the movie enters some risqu territory.  Raines ""tarts it up"", dressing provocatively, and attracts the attention of the orchestra drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.), who regularly flirts with women in the audience from his drum stool.  On Cook's invitation, the two visit a jazz club.  ""You sure can beat one out"", Raines leers,  leaving little doubt to the nature of his frenzied drum solo, while she writhes in encouragement.

The trail of the murderer, which begins with her stare-down and stalking of an ill-fated bartender, ends when she meets Jack Marlow (Franchot Tone), a sculptor fixated on his own (guilty) hands.

""Phantom Lady"" suffers at times from the  stiffness of the acting, but Ella Raines' ""Carol"" is a landmark feminist role.  There is never any doubt that her moxie and determination is what will rescue her hapless boss (who physically resembles the falsely accused protagonist of Hitchcock's ""Frenzy"", which came three decades later).  The barely concealed and obviously relished salaciousness is remarkable for a 1940's movie.... even as the movie ends with Raines receiving a marriage proposal through a Dictaphone.  That scene is just about as good as Hitchcock's winking sign-off in ""North By Northwest"".  The difference is that Hitchcock never had an actress who could deliver the Freudian jokes with the kind of panache that Raines did.  Watching this movie will make you wish that Raines' success had carried her to greater heights than it did.  She retired from acting in 1957, at age 36.",1497225600,,2709,5.123006833712984

7790253,4,0783224583,"Wonderful atmosphere, unbelievable plot.

This movie set the standard for the tone of noir movies, as Crowther wrote: ""full of the play of light and shadow, of macabre atmosphere, of sharply realistic faces and dramatic injections of sound. People sit around in gloomy places looking blankly and silently into space, music blares forth from empty darkness, and odd characters turn up and disappear. It is all very studiously constructed for weird and disturbing effects.""

I greatly enjoyed those features, and have spent many happy hours enjoying them in other noir movies. Sadly, in this example, as Crowther also wrote -- they forgot the plot.

Those not deep into noir or Woolrich might not know that Rear Window was based on a Woolrich story.  Anyhow, I loved the film. It has special pleasures for fans of Peter Lorre and Dan Duryea, such as myself.
