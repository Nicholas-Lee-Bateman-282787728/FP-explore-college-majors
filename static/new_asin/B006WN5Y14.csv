5024088,4,B006WN5Y14,"Kristine Opalais brings great intensity to the oddly-composed leading role (Rusalka is mute for half of the opera) and redeems the dismayingly cnynical production; in place of the fairy tale, this Munich production turns the Water Goblin into a Castro-like pedophile and abuser and Jezibaba the witch into a nasty enabler of her predatory husband. Without Opalais' dramatic urgency, this production would be unrelievedly nasty--more Hobbes than Rousseau on human nature. Such a produciton simply diminishes Dvorak's luminous score.",1375660800,11,531,5.734177215189874
5024089,4,B006WN5Y14,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN THIS OPERA. I HAVE A CD RECORDING WITH FLEMING AND HEPPNER. I MUST ADMIT THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. I HAVE NO COMPLAINT ABOUT THE STAGING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD STAGE IT TO EVERYONE'S LIKING. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE VOICES  I WAS CAPTIVATED BY KRISTINE OPOLAIS. HER SINGING AND ACTING WAS SUPERB, ESPECIALLY THE LAST SCENE. ALSO I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH KLAUS FLORIAN VOGT, HOWEVER,THERE WERE PARTS OF SOME SCENES THAT I FEEL WERE A LITTLE TOO GRAPHIC. BUT THIS IS THE MODERN ERA,AND I BELONG TO A MUCH OLDER GENERATION. ALSO I GREW UP IN THE TIME OF THE ""GOLDEN AGE OF OPERA."" OVERALL,TO ME THIS WAS A VERY GOOD PRODUCTION WHICH I WILL ENJOY WATCHING MANY TIMES-I HOPE.",1374969600,7,728,4.313868613138686
5024090,2,B006WN5Y14,"This is one of my very favorite operas... I returned this production. It is arrogant and insulting. I think the audience has enough intelligence to understand the story at many levels, not just one.",1369353600,11,198,4.852941176470588
5024091,5,B006WN5Y14,"I have the Fleming DVD as well.  This is far superior, despite the sensationalism of the production. Kristine Opalais is the big diference as Rusalka. She is an incredible actress as well as singer.  This is a truly gorgeous, exciting opera certainly equivalent to the great operas like Jenufa, Onegin, etc. that are done more often.  It will be performed in Feb. by undergraduate students at Stetson University School of Music, Deland Florida in English.",1354320000,7,455,5.04
5024092,5,B006WN5Y14,"The director interprets the Freudian, often ugly element beneath the fairytale rather than the rather shallow and almost silly surface of the fairytale, itself. There are some shocking elements such as child abuse, overt sexuality,and the skinning of a deer.  Somehow, this makes sense if one delves beneath the surface.  The singing and acting carry the concept successfully.  The Rusalka is a great singing actress and makes the other Rusalka, Fleming, in her DVD seem bland.  Despite my strong preference for old fashioned production, I am bowled over by this one.  The opera, itself, contains great music. Don't miss. Make sure you see the making of section on the disc to understand what the director is trying to do.",1346544000,24,722,5.033613445378151
5024093,5,B006WN5Y14,"From the man who envisaged the Flying Dutchman as an asylum seeker in a 2010 production of Wagner's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-fliegende-Hollnder/dp/B004Q2TWKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der fliegende Hollnder</a>&nbsp;for De Nederlandse Opera, cutting-edge opera director Martin Kusej reworks Dvork's dark fairy-tale Rusalka into a case of child abuse, where an innocent wood nymph and her sisters are victims of a Josef Fritzl-like Water Goblin. Evidently then, this production for the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich in 2010 is not one for the traditionalists. For anyone a bit more open minded to the greater potential of opera, this is an incredibly imaginative interpretation that gets right to the dark heart of the work, and it's sung magnificently by all the principal performers.

In the context in which it is presented, lines like ""I'd like to leave her to escape from the depths/I want to become a human being/And live in the golden sunshine"" take on an entirely new meaning when they are uttered by a young woman being held captive with her sisters in the basement and routinely abused by their father. Escaping from this dungeon, and faced with the reality of life outside the abusive circle that is the only kind of relationship she has even known, Rusalka is evidently profoundly traumatised and damaged by the experience, her ""womanhood defiled"", and she remains mute and unable to communicate or function as any other human being. The words, the tone and the true depths of what this means takes on an incredibly sinister and infinitely more tragic edge when it is applied to real-life in this way and taken out of the realm of mere fairy-tale.

Is this a distortion of the original intentions of the opera, or does it get to the heart of what is already suggested in the fairy-tale story (and we all know the dark origins of such tales), and to the heart of what is there in the often sinister tone of Dvork's score itself? It's hard to argue that such interpretations have no place in opera when the power of the piece speaks for itself, when it shows an audience something of the world we live in today, tackling in a genuinely artistic and insightful way a subject that we would find hard to relate to or even come close to comprehending. One could question why not create a new opera to deal with such subjects rather than use Rusalka, but it's hard to dispute that this production doesn't give as much to Rusalka as it takes from it, using the power and an edge that is already there in the music, but taking it to a new level.

A lot of credit for this has to go also to Toms Hanus, the Bayerische orchestra and the performers who work together to help bring this off. Kristne Opolais, not only has the voice to carry this, but she has excellent acting ability also in a highly challenging role, and it makes all the difference here. Klaus Florian Vogt's lyrical tenor should already be well-enough known and he not unexpectedly demonstrates a fine sensitivity as the Prince here, but the darker tones of Nadia Krasteva as the foreign princess and Gnther Groissbck as the Water Goblin also make a lasting and unforgettable impression. This quality of interpretation ensures total fidelity to the intent of the opera as it was originally written.

There's little to fault either with the presentation on Blu-ray. The image is clear and sharp with no significant issues, though some minor flutter can be detected in one scene. Audio tracks are PCM Stereo and DTS HD Master Audio 5.1.  The surround track is listed on the cover as DTS HD-MA 5.0, but this is incorrect, and there is definitely activity on the LFE channel (which isn't even usually the case on most 5.1 mixes). The BD comes with a fine half-hour featurette on the production, featuring interviews with all the main contributors.",1327708800,17,3868,4.92638036809816

8505679,3,B006WN5Y14,"The only reason to purchase this DVD is for the performance of Kristine Opalais as Rusalka. She rises above the confused staging and direction to create a sympathetic character of substance and consequence. Her vocal performance is outstanding, especially in the scene in the final act when she reluctantly embraces the Prince, bestowing on him the kiss of death. She clearly and convincingly conveys the humanity she has (unknowingly) achieved, when he dies in her arms.",1483920000,,471,5.2105263157894735

8505681,5,B006WN5Y14,"As many viewers, I was expecting a modern take on the fairy tale.  However, knowing Martin Kusej was directing, one can expect a very ""out there"" production.  And that is the case with this Rusalka.  If you are expecting the typical old-fashioned tale you will be disappointed, as this is not a literal interpretation of the story.  But if you really pay attention to the context of the story and the underlying contexts of the story, then you'll notice Kusej's vision works perfectly.  The production is bold, at times crude and over the top, but it pushes the viewer to the edge. And Kusej makes great use of analogies and symbolism to support the story (e.g. Rusalka does not sing to a moon, but the idea is well carried out).
Musically speaking, Kristine Opolais is magnificent.  Vocally she displays beautiful colors throughout, and is able to showcase acting skills as few others opera singers. Her Rusalka is simply superb.  Gunther Groissbock is strong vocally and artistically in an off-putting depiction of the Goblin. Both, Nadia Krasteva and Janina Baechle, as the Foreign Princess and Jezibaba respectively, are amazing.  Unfortunately, it was the Prince of Klaus Florian Vogt the one that I felt fell short in matching the vocal excellence of the rest of the cast.  The Nymphs, Chor der Bayerischen Staatsoper and Bayersischen Staatsorchester under Tomas Hanus are in great form and are able to highlight the subtle details of this beautiful score.
If you buy this, make sure to watch the bonus feature to fully understand the director's vision. I even would suggest to watch that before the opera, then you'll see how much it make sense.",1457740800,,1652,4.913669064748201
8505682,1,B006WN5Y14,"If this production is ""highly acclaimed"" we're in an age of mediocrity. Unfortunately this is the sort of production you might watch once--if you can sit through it-- but never again. The director has had a field day coming up with all sorts of vulgar and obscene bits of acting. There are multiple crotch & breast grabs and other revolting scenes, all designed to titillate or disgust, but in my opinion going far beyond what Dvorak might have had in mind when he wrote this work. It's true there is some very good singing, especially from soprano Kristine Opolais as Rusalka, baritone Gunther Grossbock as the water goblin, and mezzo Nadia Krasteva as the foreign princess.",1434844800,8,675,4.827586206896552
8505683,1,B006WN5Y14,Why would they take this beautiful opera and turn into something modern? I am sorry I purchased this version and it's a shame because the music and story are so great. Ruined by stage production. Why don't they stick to traditional production. I feel bad for the great singers and musicians who played so well.,1428883200,4,310,4.654545454545454

8505686,1,B006WN5Y14,"It is true that Kristine Opolais is a marvelous singer.

The mise-en-scene is for me a total betrayal of Dvorak's ""symbolic"" opera.  My first reaction was to send the DVD back, but I am keeping it for possible comparison with a more honest effort to state Dvorak, not to rewrite his work in sado-masochistic terms.",1403913600,3,314,4.6909090909090905
8505687,4,B006WN5Y14,"Musically, very strong performances pretty much all around. Kristine Opolais is marvelous in a very demanding role - her singing is beautiful and her acting (important in a role so often silent) is quite good. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of this production is excellent acting without compromising on the quality of musical performances. The recording is adequate, irritating moments here and there where an on-stage actors sounds off-stage, but generally OK. The production is very challenging, which isn't necessarily bad, but in this case I think is a bit over the top. Does the performance engage the audience or distract the audience? I think, by in large, the concept might have worked but for the tendency to go overboard - I'm looking at you, ballet with eviscerated deer corpses - but I found the music and the libretto a jarring juxtaposition with the events on stage more than once. I highly recommend watching the ""Making of"" documentary before viewing the performance. This will help you understand the action and the choices in the production as opposed to just gawking in open-mouthed horror. And conceptually, it's an interesting interpretation. A lighter touch might have yielded something quite remarkable, but as it is, this ""jumped the shark"" for me. 4 stars on the basis of excellent music and vocal performance, which is, after all, what it is all about.",1379116800,13,1377,5.043859649122807
