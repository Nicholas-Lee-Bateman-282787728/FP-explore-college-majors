1845141,1,B00008G8W6,"The song at the beginning of the video is awful, in my opinion.  This is quite a long video and isn't really for babies or toddlers.  It shows different kinds of music, such as jazz (which they say is ""improvisation""...I'm not sure if that's entirely true), classical, country, rock 'n' roll.  They show different kinds of instruments like wind, stringed, percussion.  They discuss pitch, tone, melody, harmony, tempo, rhythm.  They sing a couple of songs (Mary Had A Little Lamb, Do Your Ears Hang Low), they show how to make some homemade instruments.  They have kids making sounds like a dog, cat, car horn, whistle, snapping, etc.  They also show some dancing like ballet and the hula.  Like all Brainy Baby videos, they have a review.  They ask a question and then say, ""Yes, you got it!!"" or ""You're right.  Good Job!""  I wonder how that will go over if your kid answers it wrong?  Anyway, it's not one that I would even want to keep.  I'm glad I checked it out from the library before buying.  Please read more of my reviews for many other childrens videos.",1116374400,2,1064,4.590425531914893
1845142,4,B00008G8W6,"They've never danced before but this video seemed to get them charged up. I have noticed that they are really happy after we have seen this video. I don't play it before bedtime - I do it at the start of the day and it really cheers them.
There are parts that can be slow for a younger child (my twins are (14 months) the talking about instruments etc could make a younger baby bored. There's sort of a tempo skipping sequence and my daughter who prefers to loll around was actually attempting to skip.",1076630400,,502,4.294736842105263
1845213,4,B00008G8W6,"I gave it a 4 star rating because its ok we liked it. Its not great but its ok. For a child or baby learning the language, it offers the basics, colors, fruit, hello, goodbye... My daughter liked the spanish version of mary had a little lamb the best as well as watching the children play. Just another video to help your baby develop. I used to reinforce it by showing her different stuff that was the same color as what they showed like green leaves or purple toy so she heard the word not only on the video but used in the house.",1402531200,,532,4.125
1845214,5,B00008G8W6,I love this educational DVD and I especially like that the words are provided in English on the bottom right corner. My 2-year old has been repeating a lot of what she sees in the DVD. I highly recommend this great DVD.,1398729600,2,219,4.238095238095238
1845215,5,B00008G8W6,"Both my kids were absolutely captivated by the music on this DVD.  I got the Baby IQ (Brainy Baby) - Colors.  My 3 year old loved it and now my 16 month old continues to love it!  In fact, he stopped eating well when he hit the one year mark, and this is one of very few videos that continues to be a favorite at dinner time, even after several months of use multiple times a week.  I can feed him a full meal, no problem to this one.  I ordered this DVD in Russian thinking it would be good language exposure, but the videos have no words, so don't worry about the language selection (at least not for the colors/tzveta edition.",1390262400,,629,4.122950819672131
1845216,5,B00008G8W6,"I bought this DVD as an introductory lesson in Spanish for my 18 month old daughter. I was worried about whether or not this would hold her attention long enough for her to actually learn something. All I can say is, ""Thank You so much"" to the makers of this DVD!! Not only does this DVD hold her attention but she begs me everyday, by pointing to her nose and then the t.v for me to put it on for her. Nariz (which is nose in spanish) was the first word I tested her on a week into this and realized she was remembering what she was seeing and learning. My daughter is not talking a whole lot yet but, whatever I ask her to point at in Spanish she knows exactly what I'm referring to. I wish brainy baby would make this in higher levels for as the child grows. Great DVD, I would recommend buying this.",1386374400,8,803,4.0886075949367084
1845217,5,B00008G8W6,"My three kids (ages 1, 3, 5) love to watch this video and enjoy using it to learn Spanish!  It's definitely worth it.",1376956800,,117,4.086956521739131
1845218,5,B00008G8W6,"My toddler absolutely loves all of the Brainy Baby IQ DVD series. Although there are not any words being spoken, the classical music and high quality images are great. The Baby IQ series encourages my toddler son to talk more. He says a lot of words when he's watching like colors, numbers, shapes, or just plain words. I also talk about on screen images when watching the DVD too. The DVDs encourages curiosity from my son and he's constantly asking ""What is that?"" while watching. Often times he's giggling and pointing to the TV while entranced with this DVD. This is such a great educational buy and I wish that I'd found it during his infancy. Excellent buy and I highly recommend this to those who have babies and toddlers!",1358121600,,729,4.615384615384615
1845219,5,B00008G8W6,"I bought this product for my granddaughter to introduce her to Spanish as a second language.  I don't speak Spanish but want to expose her to more than counting to ten and the names of the colors.  This product teaches basic vocabulary from native speakers.  I bought Bilingual Baby at the same time and had I known that Brainy Baby includes all of Bilingual Baby and is produced by the same people, I would have bought just this one.  I'm starting before she is talking so she is learning the vocabulary meaning and language equivalent.  As a 30 year veteran retired educator, I highly recommend this product.

1845220,5,B00008G8W6,"My great grandson can barely tear his eyes away from the screen. When he hears the music now, he immediately looks at the TV. It's amazing how much babies crave mental stimulation. He's a very smart guy, and adding this DVD to the tools we use to keep his wheels turning has been a joy to experience!",1349222400,,300,4.280701754385965
1845221,5,B00008G8W6,"My 4 and 1/2 month old daughter, has become completely captivated by these DVDs. She has been listening to classical music for some time now. We even purchased the belly audio system, when she was in the womb. Over the past weeks, she does not wake up crying. It took about 2 or 3 weeks of rotation, now she is hooked, while rocking in her Zen swing or jumperoo. We rotate between calling out the colors, but it seems she much calmer now and is just taking it all in.",1311724800,,467,4.2
