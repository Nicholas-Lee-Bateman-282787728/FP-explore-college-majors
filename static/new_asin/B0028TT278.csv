8357007,3,B0028TT278,"This man is an artist with wood, no doubt.  He shows step-by-step procedures on how to turn some lovely Christmas ornaments.  The only thing that distracted me and detracted from the dvd was the ten minutes he spends, right in the middle of the videos, first talking about how great a wood turner he is (no argument, so pretty useless taking up 5 min of video), and then another five minutes listing all of the politicians to whom he has been kind enough to send his work for free, and every single one of them is a right-wing nutcase.  I don't see why he has to take up video time with (very dubious) politics.  Therefore, three stars, not the five this could easily have rated.",1394841600,,679,4.408
8357008,5,B0028TT278,this video is well worth the price.  The authors explainations are very good and I feel that I learned a lot from this video.  My only complaint is that the background music is too loud and becomes distracting at times.,1335052800,2,219,4.45
