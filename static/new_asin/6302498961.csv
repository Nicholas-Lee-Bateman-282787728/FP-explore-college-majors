I picked up Spanish while in the Navy for four years in the 1950s, and watched some of the same movies at movie theaters in San Diego, California. This movie was a delight.",1390176000,,364,4.2898550724637685
7826719,5,6302498961,"The old Mexican customs like those here in the movie shows me that for sons and
daughters it was nearly impossible to adhere to very regirous rules imposed by
the father, especially. The wife had to live under the same rules.
Father was like a God - he could do whatever he wanted but havens forbid that
the family members do the same thing?  He is a very hipocrate person.
He was a womenizer but yet he thought of himself as a good husband because
inside the house he respected his wife but outside the house - he did not.
This movie is full of misunderstandings that gets everyone in trouble.
The old goat thinks he can still attract a young lady to marry him.
And when that didn't happened, he went into a rage that no one could calm.
This movie shows how impossible it was to live with this man. No one
could put sense into him, he would not listen to anyone, he was the king!!
And he liked it like that. However there came a time when even the King had
to fall.",1343001600,,966,4.165775401069519
7826720,4,6302498961,"There is alot of things we can learn from our Mexican culture and one of them is not to talk back to your father. Respect the mother like the most sacred person in the house, but dad had the upper hand. In the movie, the father abused that privilege and though his son did love and respect his father, especially defended his morals and abusiveness, the father still degraded him in the home and in public. I watched this movie with my husband. We both grew up watching Pedro Infante movies and all others. His 2 cent was, if there were still fathers who almost carried on like the father in the movie, there might not be so much violence in our country. He also said, it should not be misinterpred either. Use the discipline with respectable caution. The father figure portrayed in the movie was a reflection of my own father. In time we, as siblings lost respect for him in our own way. The movie was sad and then very dramatic, but back in the day, morals were very important. There is too much verbal and emotional abuse and sadness, even without saying one bad word, not even in spanish. I hope this helps, but sometimes I wish I did not purchase the movie, because it brought back so many bad memories from my own abusive father.",1291680000,5,1235,4.397379912663755
7826721,5,6302498961,"Domingo and Andrs Soler with Pedro Infante, they are really great. It's a must, for all of Pedro Infante's fans. But if you can, try buying first ""La Oveja Negra"", 'cause that's the first part of this movie. Or buy them both at the same time. The problem is if you buy ""La Oveja Negra"" first then you'll surely want to watch the sequel: ""No desears la mujer de tu hijo"" and the same if you buy the sequel first (i'm telling you, I did that and I just wanted to keep watching).
Cruz Trevio (Domingo Soler) father of Pedro Infante in this film, likes women, and Pedro must do everything the father desires. These both films are funny but they also have drama on them. Just watch it and enjoy them.",1056412800,8,695,4.2727272727272725
