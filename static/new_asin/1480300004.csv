I recommended it because is easy to get this info",1393632000,,112,4.65
8602251,4,1480300004,"This DVD is certainly what it aspires to be: a good hour and a half of discussion about the tiniest to largest of drumset setup details, including such specific (and interesting) topics as carpet thickness and throne base orientation. The performances are a bit unnecessary (a little boring, actually) and the the whole DVD is sort of cheaply produced but there's a lot of good info in here, especially for younger drummers. You'll probably learn something. I recommend it.",1364688000,,473,5.0
