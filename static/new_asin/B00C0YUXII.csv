8576091,4,B00C0YUXII,Documentary with Swimme was wonderful but the conversations with Tucker left much to be desired.,1442361600,,96,5.466666666666667

8576093,5,B00C0YUXII,This is a landmark presentation of the evolution of the universe and of our understanding - and misunderstanding -  of it. Should be required viewing for all secondary students and enjoyable and educational viewing for their parents.,1400198400,5,233,5.297297297297297
8576094,3,B00C0YUXII,"I love programs like this. I love when documentaries pull you into their power of storytelling.

Although this documentary is powerful and poetic, it seems to wander about aimlessly at times. For instance, it suggests that somehow the Earth itself could be somehow directing its own destiny, suggesting that the Earth has kept a temperature conducive to life, not by coincidence, but by purpose, regulating that temperature against the backdrop of the changes in the sun and the solar system in order to harbor life. They suggest that the Earth itself might be a system that is aware and cognizant of it's destiny, but then quickly leave that premise without elaborating in any way or backing that notion up with empirical evidence.

That is an interesting suggestion. And you would think that there would be some reason that it was presented, but no. It just quickly moves to the next somewhat loosely related topic. There was no common thread here for me, nor anything new. It was like listening to someone who rambles on while forgetting the point of their original story.

This information is nothing new, but the format is interesting, if you can get used to the narrator's idiosyncrasies. And the cinematic photography is breathtaking.",1375574400,5,1241,4.9855072463768115

Since 1977, I have sought to image, describe and conceptualize in easily understandable ways the evolutionary story of how the world came to be. I tried to do this first for myself, a non-scientist, and for other seekers who also longed to understand. The scientific discoveries of the evolution of the Universe are all encompassing, leaving no dimension of human experience unaffected. The writings of Thomas Berry became totally engaging, but there were so few resources for communicating their power. For decades at Genesis Farm, we literally ""cut and pasted"" drawings, charts, timelines, rituals, snippets of films, lectures and images in a constant attempt to grasp, understand and share the enormity of what this ""new cosmology"" was revealing.

At long last, this masterful resource provides the mind and heart with an understandable history of how everything came into being.  Through profound and accessible imagery and narration, it also illuminates the exceptional capacities of Brian Swimme, Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim and all their associates to grasp such enormous concepts of time and space as well as the intimacy of our very human selves, bound together in the marvel of existence.  Never do they lose sight of the mystery and meaning so necessary for our human community to take our part in the ongoing journey of life.  The Journey of the Universe film, book, and series of conversations are the vital tools we have needed for laying the foundations of a future worthy of our children.
