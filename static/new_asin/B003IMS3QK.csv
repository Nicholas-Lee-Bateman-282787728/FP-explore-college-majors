WELL sad to say but when I purchase DVD's I do not open them up until I am ready to watch them. I received my package on June 8, 2017.  Rainy Saturday on November 4, 2017 I decided it would be a great day to watch Sweet Home Alabama.  I unsealed the DVD Set (3 DVDs) and put in the DVD to discover it did not work Invalid so I put the other 2 DVD's and same message INVALID and would not work.  I contacted Seller and they will not replace or do any resolution since 30 days had passed.  Well if they did not sell me trash I would not have had to worry about the 30 days expiring!!!!
