7983073,1,B00008G8PB,"Volume 1 of Crying Freeman had the absolute best begining of any Anime I've ever seen. I swore the employed a master mind to write the first half of thier first volume. Sadly the second half turns to crap quick with pointless turn of events.
  I bought this second volume hoping it would return to the beauty in the begining of the first... Sadly I was very disappointed, its worse. Its like they hired the best story teller of all time to start the story, and after the first hour of script they gave it to a 13 year old boy in an institute to finish. There is pointless sex scenes, like a girl has to have sex with him so that the enemy can learn about him, then he has to have sex to get information, he gets a lot done in his pointless sex. I like how one moment he gets off a plane and for no reason with no explination he is running after the bad guys with this big chick with him, except... she is naked for some reason... I always jog naked through the dessert.... WTF?... This movie blew my mind... seriously it was degrated into a testosterone driven pornoish second rate action anime. They switch artist midway through this volume, and the new artist sucks (going broke maybe, needed someone cheeper?) the shading is horrible... really sad outcome... too bad I bought volume 3 at the same time, I may cry when that comes in the mail.",1215648000,,1344,4.308300395256917
7983074,4,B00008G8PB,"Crying Freeman, Vol. 2: A Taste of Revenge contains Crying Freeman episodes 3 and 4.  Episode 3, ""Shades of Darkness,"" is absolutely sublime.  It will have your mouth hanging open in awe.  This is what anime is supposed to be.  Episode 4, ""Oshu Tohgoku,"" however, is a big disappointment -  but I will talk about that later.  It is absolutely worth buying this DVD just for ""Shades of Darkness.""

A Taste of Revenge is the second of three DVDs in the Crying Freeman anime series.  Each DVD contains two hour-long episodes.  In ""Revenge,"" Yoh Hinomura is the newly-instilled leader of the powerful 108 Dragons Hong Kong Triad.  He and his wife, Emu Hino, have new names given to them by the elderly former leaders.  Yoh is ""Lon Tayan,"" Emu ""Fu Chinran.""  But Yoh is known mostly as Crying Freeman, or simply Freeman.

""Shades of Darkness"" is partly about an African organization called the ""Horn of Africa"" that is after Freeman.  The leader is a powerul young woman, Bagu Nagu.  She is such an awesome character.  She calls to mind the Shaft films of the ""70's.  The other part of the episode involves a legendary blade that Fu wants to make her own.  The climactic scene on the rooftop as Fu dances with it by the light of the full moon had me practically standing up and applauding, it is so beautiful.

The second episode is titled after the typical BIG BAD GUY.  In it Bagu Nagu, now ""Dark Eye,"" is reduced to a female rape victim.  Unforgivable!  The rest of the episode is hackneyed and not even plausible.",1114560000,,1512,4.563432835820896
7983075,5,B00008G8PB,I'm a huge Crying Freeman fan! I'm so happy it's out on DVD!,1065916800,,60,3.6923076923076925
7983076,4,B00008G8PB,I have the 5 video series of Crying freeman and have been waiting a long time for the series to make its way to DVD.  I must say I am a bit dissappointed that they did not release the series on fewer dvds but it is about money.  As for the person who commented on the animation on this dvd.  It looks like it does on vhs which is what most fans that are buying the series expect.  There is a change in the animation style but things do return to the original style.  I mean considering when this series was created it is very good but it's no Ninja Scroll or Cowboy Bebop.,1063065600,,572,3.982456140350877
7983077,2,B00008G8PB,"ive been into the series since its inception, and was quite happy with the first episode. Episode two fell off a bit....
Now we have these two. Episode three is not all that bad, but lacks a cohesive story line. A major portion is given to 'the story thus far"", and the ending just falls into an unbelievable mish mosh of events. Granted, I don't expect 'reality', but something a little more believable than this would be nice. I'll spare the details for those that wish to take a look themselves.
As for episode 4 (2nd story of dvd), what the hell happened???? I can't remark on the story, as I was so dissapointed I turned it off after 5 minutes......The problem is the art work. It looks like the cheapest work I've ever seen in a anime release. Simple colors, the drawings are extremely simplistic and done poorly. Most of the characters rarely even look like themselves. Anyone know what happened here? I don't know if this was a slap-dash production to release the dvd, but it's not even worth the tax I paid.....
Now I'm curious to see how the 3rd cd comes across.....",1056585600,,1076,4.494897959183674
