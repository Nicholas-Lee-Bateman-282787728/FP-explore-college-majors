2654884,1,B000ICM2I8,"The standard of this DVD is so bad it almost belies belief. If you are a Kenton fan give this a miss. The picture is the worst I have ever seen on any DVD and will disappoint anyone who should buy it.

Robert Widener has got a lot to answer for. This is not even worth one star.",1165881600,11,278,3.793103448275862
8144943,4,B000ICM2I8,"The picture quality is awful and Stan is not his usual energetic self, but the band is up to the usual standards we expect of a Kenton band and the audience makes up for Stans lack of energy! While not as outstanding as some of his other live recordings, this is piece of Kenton history",1518652800,,286,4.218181818181818
8144944,2,B000ICM2I8,"I have been a Kenton fan for almost 50 years.  I had seen him perform live at least a dozen times.  It was good to see a concert again.  But, this was the worst collection of soloists ever.  These guys sound like a high school band.  They destroyed some great arrangements.",1242432000,,273,4.2745098039215685
8144945,1,B000ICM2I8,"Frankly, this DVD was disappointing. The sound is reasonable but the picture was bad. It was only possible to recognise individual musicians at times, Stan was just a blur, and there was no clarity at all throughout the concert. That was a shame as I have been waiting for a filmed recording of Stan and his Orchestra for a long time. It is obvious that the filming was done by an amateur and maybe the camera operator was unaware of the fuzziness that his/her filming produced. Unfortunately such an event cannot be repeated. The music was good and enjoyable but I sincerely hope that, with modern technology, someone can improve the clarity of picture for an what was possibly a memorable concert for those attending.",1183161600,4,719,4.76
8144946,1,B000ICM2I8,"Despite hyperbolic publicity claims by the producer, who features himself and his name all over the place, this must be the most truly awful visual record of a performance ever offered for public sale. It looks as if it had been shot using a static home video camera producing images so weak that I defy anyone to identify a single member of the band - and no personnel, composers or arrangers are provided: truly unforgiveable for a release that is aimed at a specialised viewer. And it's no use buy their companion CDs of the concert as they don't give the complete personnel either. An outrageous rip-off at such a price. - David Meeker.",1181520000,2,640,4.62280701754386
8144947,4,B000ICM2I8,"The Lost Concert by Stan Kenton is about as good as it gets.  This particular DVD emphasises many of the wonderful musicians that made up the Kenton band. Brass sounds could not be better.  Just sit back and really appreciate the God given talent of this group of musicians and of course, Stan himself. A chance to relive this era of GREAT music.",1171497600,2,346,4.476190476190476
8144948,1,B000ICM2I8,"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this tape, sound was awful, picture quality amateurish at best, no color correction was made and the MC was far less than professional.

I was hoping to have a gathering with some friends who are Kenton fans, but wouldn't subject them to such a poor presentation. I don't know why the other artists names were on the bill, Rugolo, Goodman etc....they didn't appear, nor was any mention made of them.",1170720000,2,446,4.717948717948718
8144949,3,B000ICM2I8,"In May of 1977 Stan Kenton fell and experienced a serious concussion.  He was never the same afterwards.  Whether it was restlessness or financial need that drove hin back on the road, he was anxious to return.  Having seen a number of appearances from 1975 through 1978 I can attest to the fact that  this is an authentic version of the post-injury Stan.  A world of difference from some of the more lively shows before his accident.

Stan is a shell of his former self, without animation and seemingly without enthusiasm.  And yet, that said, the band was determined to see the ""old man"" off to a good finish, and they play well here.  Although it's been almost thirty years, I still have great memories of seeing the Stan Kenton Orchestra.  Even on a bad night they were the best ticket in town.",1168992000,7,798,4.524475524475524
8144950,4,B000ICM2I8,Although the sund quality and some of the video re not the best I would recommend this DVD to all Kenton fan and ll progressive jaz fans.  It is a slice of jazz and musical history.  Stan died 27 years ago but his music lives on.,1168300800,,229,3.9565217391304346
8144951,3,B000ICM2I8,"Despite the two guys who critized this DVD I got it anyway and am glad I did.  I got better results in 1978 with my Beta cam-corder.  It is grainy and the sound isn't up to par.  I played it through my Bose unit and it improved the sound.  Just seeing Kenton, a year and a half before he died in August 1979, playing the piano in his unique style and trying to recreate the sound that made him famous, is well worth the ten bucks.

I saw Kenton at the Capitol and Paramount theaters in New York City.  Shorty Rogers, Chico Alvarez, Howard Rumsey, Art Pepper, Boots Mussulli, Kai Winding and the great singers Anita O'Day and June Christy were just part of the band in those days.  Vido Musso, Pete Rugolo and Bob Cooper were his arrangers and some arrangeements are a part of this DVD.  Sit back,listen and remember the days when the stage rose from the belly of the Paramount theatre and you heard Artistry In Rhythm.  Those were the days!",1168214400,6,940,4.325714285714286
8144952,1,B000ICM2I8,"I saw the Kenton band over half-a-dozen times from the mid-seventies till the mid-eighties, and never heard them sound half this bad.  If it were just the abysmal sound quality, I would persist; however, the ensemble work is out-of-tune and sloppy, the solos uninspired, the rhythm section like someone building a garage.

My guess is that someone hired a few 'ringers' for this show who simply didn't know the book.  That, or half the band was soused, which I doubt Kenton would've allowed.

I profoundly agree with the above reviewer: save your money.  If you want something approximating what Kenton actually sounded like, buy the ""Stan Kenton Today"" live CD, which is a reissue of the double-album vinyl ""Live in London"" first released in 1972: it coos and screams.",1166832000,10,769,4.930232558139535
