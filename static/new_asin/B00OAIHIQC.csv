6731310,5,B00OAIHIQC,One of the best police series ever produced.,1416873600,,44,4.625
6731311,5,B00OAIHIQC,"Great TV show.... And a Must have...
Also on Shouts web site... It has that this has CC Closed Caption....
So check Shouts web site. If you need  CC Closed Caption...
And remember. CC will not come in on with the HDMI cable...
You need the Y/R/W set up got the CC to come in..My Blu-Ray player has both the R/W/Y and HDMI. And my new TV has the hook up's for them also..
((I'm hearing that the CC will come in through the HDMI cables on the New DVD players)). But I have yet to find one that does it.
SDH will come in over the HDMI cable.
One thing I do see.  CC closed Caption will come in with the HDMI cable from the Cable Box. And that shows it can be done..
But as I have said. I have yet to see CC Closed Caption come in through the HDMI cable on DVD's.",1415491200,,759,3.858974358974359
6731312,5,B00OAIHIQC,"Yes!!  The next season of NYPD Blue is here, and they now only have four left to complete the series!  Like all fans of this show, I've been overjoyed to see new DVD sets finally coming out.  I got my Season 7 set the day it was released on September 30, and now Season 8 has arrived.  This makes me very confident that they'll make it to Season 12 and we'll finally have the entire series on DVD. **(see below)**

Season 8 has twenty epsiodes of excellent writing and acting, keeping up the standard established by the previous seasons. However, another set of tough losses come about, these some of the most difficult to swallow in the show's history. Fans had already endured losing John Kelly, Bobby Simone, Sylvia Sipowicz and Andy, Jr., and of course James Martinez left after a promotion. In much the same fashion as Martinez, Lt. Fancy gets promoted to captain and leaves the squad around mid-season. I hated seeing the loss of James McDaniel, one of the finest actors on TV at the time. His character played such an important role in many, many plots, and his history and relationship with Andy Sipowicz was so complex, it really changes some of the main dynamics of the show when he leaves. With that said, his exit does provide one of my favorite moments on the show ever, when he faces down his very temporary replacement, Lt. Dalto in front of the squad, making it clear that he called in a favor to get her out the door and save his detectives from her overbearing leadership style. Great TV!

Another devastating loss to the show in this season is Diane Russell (played by Kim Delaney), who takes a leave of absence after some trying personal times. Mainly, the failed relationship she has with Rick Schroeder's Danny Sorenson leads her to finally deal with her emotions over losing Bobby and eventually leave the squad. Finally, Sorenson becomes the next character in Andy's life to die a tragic death, falling into despair over losing his relationship with Diane and seeing her leave. Although his death wasn't revealed until the first episode of Season 9, most people knew that's where things were headed, as Schroeder wasn't slated to return after Season 8. After having gone through multiple approaches throughout the time Sorenson was his partner to try to help him deal with his personal problems, Andy is now left to question himself over yet another situation that he may have been able to change had he made different decisions. I personally hated to see Danny go, as I thought Schroeder did a fantastic job during his time on the show. I even came to like his character almost as much as Jimy Smits's Bobby Simone, which I didn't expect when I heard he would be the actor stepping into the role of Andy's partner. It's a shame he had to leave, and that his character had to come to such a pitiful end.

On the plus side, Connie McDowell becomes a key character, and as fans know, she sticks around until the end and actually goes on to marry Andy and have a baby with him. She's a great actress who looks amazing, but pulls off being a tough-nosed detective believably. NYPD Blue was always a hard-hitting show, and Season 8 is one that hit the hardest. It was one of TV's best series during its run.

**Update, 4/1/15 TERRIBLE NEWS  I just found out that the company responsible for reviving NYPD Blue on DVD, Shout Factory, does NOT own the rights to the show past Season 8! In the comments below their page for Season 8, they respond to commenters asking when Season 9 will be available by saying 8 is the last season they have rights to, but they don't respond to people asking if they're trying to get the rights. Shout Factory, in my opinion, is the only chance of ever getting this series completed. Here's the address for their page with the comments about Season 9. Maybe if enough people contact them, they'll try to buy rights to the rest of the series.

**Update 2, 1/2/16 The responses from Shout Factory continued to offer no hope....until one month ago! Someone from Shout Factory responded to another question about Season 9 saying, ""Possibly. Stay tuned and check back in a couple months :)"" Something has changed! This looks promising.....fingers crossed!

**Update 3 1/7/16 HOLY CRAP!! Season 9 is now available for pre-order!!! To be released April 5 from Shout Factory!

This is a 'Plain Jane' version: it lacks the Special Features and fancy packaging, of the early Seasons, released by 20th Century Fox, in 2002, but it does have the original episodes, and that's what really counts. And, if I want to look t the Special Features, I can see them on my 2002 versions of Seasons 1 through 4.",1485302400,,391,4.444444444444445

6731336,4,B00OAIHIQC,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I can't say how happy I am that the ""NYPD Blue"" is finally back on DVD. I've waited for many years since Season 4.

Rick Schroder is great as Danny Sorensen, and the last episode of Season 8 -- i.e., Danny, in the wind, with a dead stripper in his apartment -- sets up Season 9 perfectly.

I never got to see the episode where Diane whacked Denby, so I'm very happy 14 years after that episode aired.

6731412,5,B00OAIHIQC,"This was another great season.  It was weird seeing three major characters gone over that span.  But it rolled along without missing a beat.  Probably one of Franz's best years and definitely the best season for Rick Schroeder.  The only bad thing about that season was the ill-fated relationship between Danny and Diane.  Sadly, this was the final season where NYPD Blue was getting better. Season 9 began the slow decline.  But this season was one of the best!",1423353600,6,462,4.784810126582278
6731413,5,B00OAIHIQC,"No, I'm not saying this is a show for 'all the family', I'm saying that part of what makes this show the best drama ever is the genius of the producers to keep creating a 'family of cops' feel despite stars dropping out right and left.  Here we lose Danny and Diane (though not for good in the latter case) but does that count for more than a few anxious moments of tension?  Nope.  Enter Connie and John Jr. and we're right back to the same kind of support/in-fighting/back-stabbing/loving mix that makes this drama great.  Now if only we could get that great team to help us fire the boiler under the suits to produce the last four years, 9-12.  Sure would be nice to have the entire series on hand, wouldn't it?",1423267200,7,714,4.338345864661654

6731419,5,B00OAIHIQC,NYPD Blue never disappoints.  After seven full seasons the show didn't seem to lose anything.  At least that how it seems to be.  There are a reason the series last 12 seasons.  Season 8 does not disappoint.,1421798400,,207,4.513513513513513
6731420,5,B00OAIHIQC,"Just ordered seasons 7&8. Purchased seasons 1-6. Husband and I are on season 4. Hope all the other seasons 9-12 come out real soon. Would hate to be stuck at season 8. Never saw the show when it ran initially. But we are sure enjoying the commercial free in and of itself b/c the pace of this show keeps us quite entertained and commercials can get in the way of that. We are a little disappointed in the navigation. What happened to the PLAY ALL option??? Makes no sense to not have that option. Bill Clark former NYPD Blue Officer who collaborated with the producers did a great job bringing us behind the walls of what goes down behind those walls of a police precinct. The acting was superb by the regulars, and the guests. These producers were great bringing the best out of each and everyone of them. Caruso, Smits, Delaney, Lawrence, McDaniels, Franz, Martinez, Clapp ... love them all. I am almost depressed knowing what lies ahead for Smits, Delaney, and Lawrence. But thank goodness this is only TV at it's best. And not real life we are watching on TV. Yet being fully cognizant that stuff like this really happens in the real world. Great show!!!",1421625600,4,1158,4.545454545454546
6731421,5,B00OAIHIQC,"Brilliant series from the writers of Hill Street Blues! I don't own the DVD's yet, because I am waiting for the full series to be released as a box set AND I want this in Blu-Ray! So, since this is not technically a real review, I am going to at least be responsible and give it the 5 stars the series deserves while throwing my thoughts out there: If you are such a huge fan that you have to have the series the second each season gets stingily doled out, I get it, I really do! I personally would wait, not only for the blu-ray and entire series set, but because eight seasons (or 2/3 of the series!) costs just under $200.00, which I think is a tad exorbitant. Again, if you have to have it then you have to have it, but I think that waiting would both save you money and net you the full set for a cost I am guessing will be under what the currently available 8 seasons would cost you now.",1421366400,,893,4.0508474576271185

6731426,5,B00OAIHIQC,"Took a few bucks off the price since I ordered it in October, same as they did when I ordered Season 7. But Shout Factory seems to be easing these things out with an eye on how many sell each time. I'd hoped that Season 9 was coming out in April or May, but I went over to the Shout Factory site and found a discussion board where several users expressed that hope. Only to find out that someone on their staff--he was using an official-looking Shout Factory avatar anyway--said (and this is important); ""WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHTS TO ANY SEASONS BEYOND SEASON 8"". At least one other user replied with the question; ""Then why don't you buy the rights?"" The silence was deafening on that.

Be that as it may, Shout Factory's menu format beats the original 20th Century Fox format found on Seasons 1-4. Those early seasons have a weird format in which each episode on a given disc is on its own sub-page visible on the menu, each even with its own music. To move between them takes forever! Unlike the way Shout Factory has done it the old-fashioned way with these latter seasons, so if for example you want to watch the third episode on some disc, you just arrow down to it the way normal multi-feature discs have it.

So here's what I did on those last four seasons. There have been Region 2 editions of at least the missing seasons, including the four that Shout Factory did up. So I went over to the UK page and ordered them in a bunch and tacked on an entry-level Sony player. One of those doesn't even cost what two of these series sets costs, as long as you don't insist on HDMI. And with most of my components having HDMI I've got plenty of RCA imputs on my TV. You have to chase down a UK to US power plug converter for that weird wall plug the unit has, though. There's even a currency conversion function on this site, plus nowadays you can even find links to those missing seasons, marked as ""imports"". And as you can see on the US page, nowadays there are links to all of the missing seasons (9-12) in the region 2 format that the UK page carries. Now if only somebody like Shout Factory would pick up the rights to those final 4 seasons so that fans don't have to pick up that spare region 2 player like I did to see them. Come on already--this is an award-winning series, not some also-ran that they bring in during the summer months.",1421107200,4,2345,4.3031674208144794

6731430,5,B00OAIHIQC,"NYPD is one of my favorite shows. The subplots are right on, the acting is phenomenal - I can identify with the emotions the actors portray. I look forward to it. We have elected not to have any television so we purchase DVD's usually a season at a time. I hate having to wait for the newest season to be out on DVD, and have thought about buying them as they appear on TV but prefer to watch episodes at a time with my husband. Great show-pretty explicit on some scenes.",1419811200,3,471,4.186813186813187
