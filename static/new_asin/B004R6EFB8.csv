Rarely do I go for the extras on a DVD, but on a collection like this, that is the first place I go Also strongly reccomended is ""Showtime USA"" A 4 disc boxed set with a double feature on each disc with commentary.",1350691200,,289,4.8
8438716,4,B004R6EFB8,"Bob Blair and his VCI company often go out on a limb spending funds to reissue movies that others have overlooked. Their catalog is quite varied and they just acquired the large British Rank Organisation catalog so there should be more cool stuff coming. It's been a while since I covered their DVDs so I'm trying to catch up.

This DVD is a two-parter, and I'm sure you'll see other reviews of it here on Amazon. The first part is a full feature film - the 1920 - $3 million recreation of the Bible titled ""After Six Days"". (No, the film is not about God's ""day of rest""..... It's what happened after the SEVENTH day.) Think of Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" were it to have been filmed 40 years earlier. And remember it's silent. Per the notes provided on the package this is the only known print of this film. That makes it historically important and, as a believer in film preservation I applaud VCI for restoring it (the best they could). BUT, it's not that interesting to watch and some of the cropping leaves something to be desired. But, I'll admit it's important to film historians.

The second film on this DVD - ""Yesterday and Today"" is completely different. It is a compilation of rare film footage from Edison's films of the 1890s to the comedies of the 1920s, mostly French, produced in 1953 and hosted by ""entertainer"" George Jessel at the end of his long career. Many of the film clips have not appeared on video before because they come from Europe and, again, we are told that they may be the only surviving prints.

Unlike the serious natures of the Biblical first part, VCI goes for a lighthearted view here. The 1953 feature has Jessel making jokes while - allegedly - providing info on film history. But the producers of the compilation got nearly every fact wrong. And Jessel reads these incorrect facts from cue cards placed way too far to his right. So, VCI brought in film historian Richard M. Roberts for a full-length commentary track. Roberts knew the right info for most of the errors and researched the others. He not only gives ""props"" to reissue companies like Flicker Alley (Thank you for allowing this Mr. Blair!) but also has a great sarcastic sense of humor. The commentary reminded me a lot of why I liked VCI's box set ""Showtime U.S.A. a few years ago. The corny films - with well-known talent - were supplemented by great commentary tracks. Well some were - I wish all had them). This is what makes releases like this on DVD so much fun (as well as educational.)

Unlike another reviewer I read, I'll suggest you watch Y&T with commentary track first! After all, Jessel is not saying anything important and the films included are - after all - silent. Then go back and watch the original - knowing the real facts this time.

Other bonuses include the original 1953 trailer for Y&T and the trailer for the 1946 reissue of ASD.

The two films run about an hour each so it wasn't practical to issue on separate DVDs. And the umbrella title ""Silent Discoveries"", fits it well.

Another fine release from VCI - an independent reissue imprint that often comes up with really important releases.

I hope you found this review both entertaining and helpful.

8438717,3,B004R6EFB8,"SILENT DISCOVERIES is a textbook example of how silent films were treated before preservation was taken seriously and how far preservation has come since the 1950s. Everything considered wrong with or bad about silent movies is on display here. First up let's take a look at YESTERDAY AND TODAY one of the very first silent film compilations predating Robert Youngson's more celebrated collections (WHEN COMEDY WAS KING, DAYS OF THRILLS AND LAUGHTER) by around 5 years. This 1953 offering has narration from George Jessel which is condescending and not terribly funny. He also gets virtually every film title wrong although that's not his fault but shows how little film preservationists knew back then. We know this thanks to the invaluable commentary by Richard M. Roberts who was able to track down most of the correct titles as well as identify many of the performers. First watch YESTERDAY & TODAY without his commentary and then again with it for an eye opening experience. The musical accompaniment is not bad for its vintage but there are those annoying sound effects which presenters back then felt silent movies had to have. The film clips used are in surprisingly good shape and many are very rare and are a real treat to see.

The other title in this set is an actual Italian feature from 1920 called AFTER SIX DAYS which is its 1929 sound reissue title. All the intertitles have been removed and there is some very ponderous and rather curious narration to accompany excerpts of well known classical music which has nothing to do with what's happpening on screen. Even though this is a 16mm reduction of the 35mm original which has not been restored, the movie itself is not very good with classic silent film overacting and shoddy special effects. Not being speed corrected doesn't help the film either. It's good to have AFTER SIX DAYS for historical purposes but it's tough going even for silent film enthusiasts and shows how spoiled we've become by quality releases from Flicker Alley and Kino. VCI Entertainment has released a number of silent film packages in the past few years which range from great (BECOMING CHARLEY CHASE) to good (WEISS-O-RAMA) to not-so-good (THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY: 100th ANNIVERSARY EDITION). SILENT DISCOVERIES falls into the good category but mainly for showing us how silent films used to be treated and never will be again. For that reason it will appeal to silent film lovers but others be wary. Thanks to VCI for releasing it on DVD.",1310774400,8,2485,4.902612826603326
8438718,4,B004R6EFB8,"VCI Entertainment presents ""SILENT DISCOVERIES DOUBLE FEATURE"" (After Six Days/Yesterday and Today) (1945) (119 min/B&W) -- This release from VCI should be sent to any and everyone who is interested in film history and preserving film archives. What's the big fuss about?  Many of the films shown here do not exist anywhere other than in this documentary.

AFTER SIX DAYS (1920) (62 Min/B&W) - Directed by Pier Antonio Gariazzo - The 1946 re release trailer for AFTER SIX DAYS is here and is in very good condition.  Since this is the only surviving print of the film nothing can really be done to fix its problem. There is some wear but overall the picture quality is excellent. Unfortunately, most of the top portion of the frame is missing, which means heads are cut off. And not just cropped off, heads are entirely missing.

SPECIAL EXTRA FEATURES:
1. 1946 Reissue Trailer

YESTERDAY AND TODAY (1953) (57 min/B&W) -  An extremely valuable little film in that the clips they show are unusually long - often over a minute in length. Our host Mr. George Jessel is annoying, sometimes downright rude and reads his cue cards that are obviously next to the camera.  This is a valuable little gem of a documentary guaranteed to please the silent era fans, simply electrifying.  Even though almost all the films are misidentified,  Note further in my review the clarification of *""Misidentified Films"".

* MISIDENTIFIED FILMS: -- YESTERDAY AND TODAY features the absolutely essential commentary track with film historian Richard M. Roberts as he points out the correct titles to all the films that was identifiable.  Gives the background on much of what the viewer is seeing.  Great job by Mr. Roberts as he delivers an informative and entertaining track.

SPECIAL EXTRA FEATURES:
1. Commentary by Richard M. Roberts (Film Historian)
2. Original Theatrical Trailer

Special footnote: -- The film industries and historians should see this release as a warning that no matter how big or small a film is, it can be completely lost in a matter of time. As noted from some of the past early days of Cinema that are all lost forever.

A spectacular and interesting DVD release that any fan of early cinema must have in their collection.
