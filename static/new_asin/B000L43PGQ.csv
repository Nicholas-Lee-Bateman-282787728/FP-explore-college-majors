2700205,3,B000L43PGQ,"I just finished watching Sleeper Cell - American terror and it was OK it had the potential to be a great show, but the story with one of the characters changed everything. I will admit the ending was great, it left you to wonder whats going to happen next. I would have gave this show 5 stars and suggest to everyone to buy the dvd, but I would suggest not buying this dvd because they decided to have a gay character on the show and having that character on the show was pointless, and for everyone who saw the first season and enjoyed every moment when you watch the second season, beware your gonna see some scenes that your not gonna like.",1182124800,,643,4.278688524590164
2700206,5,B000L43PGQ,"At first i wasn't sure about this show in the first season of the show. My brother had recommended it because he said it was really good. As the episodes went on i realized that to. This show in many ways is even better then 24 just because of the reality of the issues... It shows the struggle inside islam between the true islam of peace and love (the fbi agent muslim trying to stop them), and the extremists who claim they are muslims ( the terrorists), and the struggle with the image of islam in the west, as well as what our country is going through at the moment. In the end the plot, actors, and everything else are great and keep you interested until the very end. I cant wait for the next season.",1178928000,11,707,4.205882352941177
2700207,5,B000L43PGQ,"Don't get me wrong, sleeper cell is no 24.  However, if you like 24, Alias and Prison Break type shows, this is a good one to buy.  My husband and I really prefer to purchase the DVD, as opposesd to watching the show each week.  It makes for a fun rainy weekend marathon.  Plus, who wants to wait an entire week, when there is a cliff hanger.  Speaking of cliff hangers, you might also like The Shield.  Sleeper Cell is good terrorist fun.",1178496000,2,439,4.228915662650603

If anyone can identify the songs in season 2, episode 3 (""Torture"") at 21:11 (something like ""Breathe out so I can breathe you in"") and 30:30 I will paypal you $20.

2700209,4,B000L43PGQ,"A much better series than the first one, the pace is faster and the acting sharper. I liked the ambiguity of the interrogation of the terrorist leader, not gung ho captain america stuff but pointing out the absurdities of a strictly medieval faith in a modern world. No anti progress anti science stuff here!! The ending though was too loose, either there will be a series 3 or internet anoraks will be interpreting it for years",1176336000,,428,4.644736842105263
2700210,5,B000L43PGQ,"This was really good, really makes you think about terrorism and the people who fight them, it could've certianly given 24 a run for it's money. Unfortunately Showtime in its infinite wisdom cancelled this series after this season.

This is edge of your seat action following an undercover FBI agent as he infiltrates a terrorist cell and even though the series cancelled they don't leave you hanging for an ending. I loved this DVD and the first season was even better",1176163200,3,469,4.790123456790123
2700211,5,B000L43PGQ,"This is one of the most powerful and realistic depictions of the crisis we are embroiled in today with regards to radical Islam. This series helps you to understand true Islam a little better, which is something most of us need to learn about. It also gives some insight into what it is like for people undercover trying to protect us every day while we are blissfully unaware and living our lives.  I wrongfully assumed that since the ending was left up in the air that I would soon be watching Season 3 but now after reading this website, I find that this oustanding, unique series is cancelled. There are plenty of mediocre television shows being made today but Sleeper Cell is in a class by itself and its message should continue to be proliferated making us aware of the realities of the war against terrorism.",1175990400,15,815,4.582191780821918
2700212,4,B000L43PGQ,"The producers made some interesting choices for the second season of ""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"" in that when Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed (Michael Ealy) is sent on his next deep undercover mission the show is still following the other members of the first season's cell who also survived.  Farik (Oded Fehr) has been captured and is being interrogated by the American government, while Ilija Korjenic (Henri Lubatti) makes his way back to his Europe to visit his homeland of Bosnia.  Darwyn is trying to start a new life with Gayle Bishop (Melissa Sagemiller), but ends up back in another L.A. sleeper cell.  Adding insult to injury, Darwyn ends up with a new FBI handler, Agent Warren Russell (Jay R. Ferguson), who would have to work really hard just to be an idiot.  There is no doubt that this clown is going to get people killed.

A turn of events makes Darwyn the leader of the new sleeper cell, which consists of Salim (Omid Abtahi), an Iraqi ex-patriot raised in the U.K., Beeny Velazquez (Kevin Alejandro), a member of a Latino gang who became an extremist in prison, and Mina (Thekla Reuten), a Dutch woman converted to Islam by her late husband.  Initially Darwin is supposed to get his hands on a missile, but then the cell is ordered to get their hands on nuclear material.  Meanwhile, Farik is standing up to his interrogation, forcing the Americans to send him back to Saudi Arabia where the laws on torture are quite different.  For the most part during season two it is Farik who is the most interesting character and I think you have to root for him not to break as he is interrogated and tortured despite the fact he is the villain of the piece.  This is not just because the torturing escalates to a point beyond what most people would approve, but because of the insults and attacks directed towards his religious beliefs.  After all, although their interpretations are radically different, Farik and Darwyn share the same faith and one of the strengths of ""Sleeper Cell"" is that Darwyn remains true to both his beliefs and his country as his does his job.  Couple this plot line with the posturing and actions of Agent Russell and it is like the world has been turned upside down in these eight episodes.

The obvious point of comparison for ""Sleeper Cell"" in terms of contemporary American television programming is ""24.""  The key thing that they have in common is that sometimes the bad guys win; it might not be anything major, but hundreds if not thousands of people get killed.  The biggest difference between the two series is that ""Sleeper Cell"" is more grounded in the real world while ""24"" revels in hyperbole and pouring it on from start to finish.  For me the final episode ended up being problematic because it throws away a lot of the strengths of the series.  I was pretty sure I knew what Darwyn was setting up and the problem was not just that I was right (because I like to be right), but that it becomes one of those moments where the hero gives off the great one liner.  True, the one liner is from the Qur'an, but Darwyn is such the strong silent type that pretty much anything he says is not as effect as when he levels his stare on people (or pops them one on the jaw).  If that were not enough the show suddenly regresses to something like ""Gunsmoke,"" and I just do not like ""Sleeper Cell"" appealing to my baser instincts.  This series is at its best when Darwyn is walking the tightrope and at the end of this season he jumps off it to get down and dirty.",1175299200,10,3511,4.544444444444444
2700213,1,B000L43PGQ,"this is an excellent series and i was ready to buy it however, it comes with NO closed captioning, or subtitles.  So anyone that is deaf I guess you should go watch something on HBO instead....",1174694400,6,193,4.361111111111111
2700214,4,B000L43PGQ,"- REVIEW

Darwyn Al-Kareem (Michael Ealy) was having a crazy year when he infiltrated a terrorist cell who attempted to blow up a stadium in L.A.; the individuals of the cell was either killed or missing, and the leader of the group, Farik (Odeh Fehr), was imprisoned and is under serious interrogation.  Although Darwyn is taking his sweet vacation, while being with his lover Gayle and sporting a new haircut that doesn't make him look like the guy from ""C.S.I."", soon he will be playing his role once again, and he'll soon figure out that there's a lot at stake on his new mission.

In ""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"", Darwyn will once again go undercover as a member of a new terrorist cell and, once again, comprises of a variety of Islamic individuals: Salim, an British-speaking Iraqi with a dark secret (who strangely reminds me DJ Qualls); Mina, a Dutch-prostitute-turned-babysitter; and Hispanic gangster Benito.  Under circumstances, Darwyn not only goes undercover, he becomes the leader of the cell members.  Through the second Youmud Din, he faces challenges that go against him.  Not only must he control the members of the cell from their personal agendas, he must deal with a new case agent named Russell, who's a by-the-book agent that interferes with Darwyn's plan and his personal love life.  And this was all before Farik escapes from prison with his own agendas in mind.

Once again, the cast are just as great as in the first mini-series, if only with a bother or two.  Ealy continues to perceive a struggling character playing both sides, and he does a great job showing it, especially in his worst scenarios.  Fehr is equally impressive as a charming but corruptive terrorist.  Neither of these characters, despite their opposite sides, have anything to cheer or jeer about; they're characters acting out of principles.  That is what makes the cast work so well, just as much with the members of the new cell.  The actors playing Salim and Mina give an accurate performance of how their unique perspectives of Islam face against the commercialization and modern views of the American world.  Although I didn't care for them as much as the previous cell, the cell members remain to be shocked as to how normal their lives are when they aren't on a mission.

The cast should be applauded for their acting, but I personally have a soft spot for Henri Lubatti as Ilija, but only because I respect him as a ""Tribe Called Quest"" fan.  It was funny to see the runaway right-hand man of Farik with his hair bleached, but I was moved for that one scene where he thought he had to make a tough, emotional choice in order to survive, and to see him eventually pay for his choice was heartbreaking.  Believe me, there are PLENTY of heart-breaking moments in ""American Terror.""

I was disappointed with one of the cell members, Benito (or Benny as he calls himself).  It's not that he's a bad character, and the actor playing him was solid, but there weren't many screen-times with this guy.  There are plenty of scenes where I get to know more on Salim and Mina's personal lives, but not so much with Benito and how he's doing in his spare time.  By the time the big break-out comes in, he just comes and goes.  Jay R. Ferguson's role as Case Agent Russell is just plain unlikable, and though he's suppose to be an unlikable character, I think he overcompensate himself with his role.

Although the episodes are shockingly good, only episode five comes off as the weak of the bunch.  The episode covers the issue with how black people are treated by the government, as discussed within scenes between Darwyn and his father.  I don't mind discussions like that, but in a show about terrorism, it doesn't completely work and it feels out of place.  What's more unnecessary is the ridiculous scene where Mina is being threatened by the father of whose kids she's babysitting, so he can seduce her or else she's going to lose her job.  She should've walked away from that situation, she knows she's not going to last long when the terrorist act begins anyway, but she has to give a big speech about her position and such, all because she loves the kids.  Of course it all worked out for her, but come on.

""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"" avoids the trappings of ""more of the same"" sequels by having the consequences from the result of the first mini-series.  The second mini-series might have the same purpose with the same inevitable breakthrough, but the results are different and even more devastation on Darwyn's part.  In fact, his involvement will take away those he protects the most, and face the ultimate path that goes against his code.

The eight-episode season might be short, but it definitely hasn't softened or rushed the impact from the previous mini-series.  In fact, it only gets worse, and that's a great thing about the show that delves into the realistic perspectives of Islam and the war on terror.  Showtime made the right call at giving another ""Sleeper Cell"" mini-series, and a remarkable one at that.  It bugs me to know that ""American Terror"" ended in a cliff-hanger of sorts, but at least I can look forward to its third mini-series...as long as Showtime doesn't pull a ""Carnivale"" and cancel it outright.

This is Del Keyes, saying ""The enemy is here to stay.""",1166745600,6,5298,4.739367502726282

2700305,4,B000L43PGQ,The storyline tracks concerns many Americans including me have about the potential radical Islamic threat to our homeland.  What makes this series worth watching is the balance that the writers and actors to a complex and terrifying possibility.  The actors provide strong performances and the storylines show how radical Islam attracts muslims to the cause.

2700307,3,B000L43PGQ,"In the plot summary given by Amazon, the series is about a Los Angeles-based Islamic terrorist cell, headed by a charismatic and fanatical extremist, which is penetrated by a Muslim undercover FBI agent. I watched, mostly with interest, the first two series. The program as a whole is not easy to review, partly because I found it dealing in an unsatisfactory way with the whole question of terrorism in general and home-grown terrorism in particular; and partly because the script was pedestrian and for the most part implausible, although there is a distinct improvement in Season 2 over Season 1. While I would not expect a sophisticated debate about the meaning of terrorism and the basic tenets of Islam in a program of this sort, I certainly think that the debate could have been pushed a little bit further without spoiling the main aim of the program, which is to provide excitement and escapism. I would also think that less annoying ways could have been found to convince me that people who had shown themselves to be very good shots and who at times were carrying heavy-duty weapons could miss one another so stupidly and make an escape when it was simply convenient for the plot. So you end up with a program which is quite exciting and intriguing for the most part but terribly nave and disappointing at many critical points.",1463443200,2,1338,4.771551724137931

2700407,4,B000L43PGQ,"Great seies, very addictive. Shows how evil can also come in a nice package of passionate people who love their families, Farik et, al. What gets me though is Darwyn even working for an idiot like Russell who screwed up everything he touched and was bound to get Gayle and others killed. He should have refused to work for such an idiot. The difference between evil and good is very thin at this level, but the insanity of fundamentalism paired with paranoia and violence is always dangerous on too many levels to mention.",1451606400,,522,4.623655913978495

The cast was good. I did not like the acting of some of the main characters.

Michael Ealy really plays a convincing role and I like that he is not stealing the spot light but also letting other characters shine.

Content is good. I felt was educated and show succeeded in convincing the audience that being a Muslim is not a bad thing it actually helps people, its just, some times it can get seriously misunderstood.",1447027200,4,687,4.236641221374046

2700436,3,B000L43PGQ,"The first season was pretty good but into the second season the writers introduce lots of tangential subplots, as they fail to pursue the sleeper cell/under cover main plot, basically running out of pertinent aspects of the main story, a common failing of many series, but usually in the 4th or 5th season, not this early. Not interested in the personal soap opera type subplots that seriously compromise the drama. The terrorists are supposed to be importing a nuke and yet the plot is bogged down in his girlfriend's custody issue, a terrorists homosexual affair, Darwyn's issues with his father,  and the nanny being sexually abused by the man of the house. This is an admission that the writer's can't propel the original dramatic premise and need to come with extraneous conflicts. Like daytime tv soap operas of days gone by. Don't want to wade through all that to find out how they thwart the nuclear threat.",1441756800,3,915,4.828025477707007

I only gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I disliked how the series ended.  I felt that I was left hanging with no real closure on Darwyn Al-Sayeed (Michael Ealy) or Farik (Oded Fehr).
I wish Showtime or the creators of the series would add to this series by making new episodes that pick up at some point in the future from where the show ended.",1400112000,,454,4.078651685393258

2700469,5,B000L43PGQ,"This was such an extraordinary drama--love the cast, but the premise of the series is troubling because it could happen and probably will.  As I watched the intensity of this series, I wondered how the actors could come in and out of character and maintain their sanity.  I did read up on the characters and see that Farik is actually a Jew--how he was able to enter into such a persona is just amazing.  Michael Ealy was also a perfect Darwyn al sayeed.  Darwyn's FBI handlers were also well chosen--I don't know how much of this drama was based on fact and how much is fiction.  Had to remind myself it was a TV drama.  The ending was also a surprise--based more on reality then expected.  We won't see another televised version of Sleeper Cell--but we might see the real thing if we are not vigilant.",1397606400,,803,4.458904109589041

2700478,4,B000L43PGQ,"The plot line was straight forward and intense. It took some dramatic license and stereotyped aspects of particular characters, but most of the characters were believable. One big drawback was the beginning of season 2 when two central characters were killed off through questionable circumstances. This did open the way for the introduction of an incompetent handler with whom Darwin has nothing but trouble for the remainder of the season. That was too predictable. The introduction of moral issues with some of the characters was an interesting and often untried plot line in shows like this. The final episode of season 2 was tightly written with many surprises that were plausible. Unfortunately the end of the last episode did not reach resolution. It left the door open for another season, which unfortunately will never be made.",1393113600,,836,5.154411764705882

2700483,5,B000L43PGQ,"I have to admit that they only reason I started watching the show was that the main character is portrayed by Michael Ealy, who plays Dorian on Almost Human, and I am glad that I did.

The writing and acting are excellent. The story is not predictable. The characters are so well fleshed out that you can empathize with  the motivations of the antagonists, who all see themselves as heroes, and the American people as the bad guys. It's more interesting than villains motivated by greed or a quest for power. The main character struggles to maintain his cover, protect the American people, maintain his faith, deal with discrimination, not getting killed, and a host of other adversities, that all make the show a pleasure to watch.

At only two seasons long, it's binge watching worthy.",1389225600,,787,4.772058823529412

Still, the sleeper cell wasn't as riveting without the actual cell, and Darwyn's continued credibility with the Muslim terrorists was a stretch,as was the rescue of the head terrorist. Still, the last episode was a nice, unexpected touch, although you can see where they set up for season 3, which never came.

The show doesn't hesitate to be provocative, and this included the addition of a gay Muslim, which was somewhat of a clever touch, I thought. As it turned out, the plot device was badly handled by the use of pointless and repetitious sex scenes.

2700523,4,B000L43PGQ,"My first thought was that since the series was a ShowTime production, it would be cheesy.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it's actually pretty well done for an American T V production.  Here's what I liked & what I didn't:  The acting is quite good and believable from just about every player. The plots are gripping & intriguing with plenty of surprising twists you don't see coming. Keeping in mind it's fantasy so that stuff always works out & falls into place, the script manages to be not ENTIRELY out of the realm of actual possibility ( unfortunately ).  It does a good job of showing all the nefarious & evil links to the terror network one does not always think about, such as illegal drugs, child prostitution, illegal weapons markets, & other evil-doers making temporary & strange bedfellows.  What I found distracting:  Way too loud a soundtrack with such a volume I could barely make out what the actors were saying & sometimes I couldn't. Besides that, it was just unnecessarily ubiquitous and didn't add that much to setting the mood of the scene.  Also, way too much sexual activity.  It seemed that was all the terrorists were into when they weren't engaged in plotting or carrying out acts of terror.  It was just one scene after another of whores, whores, whores!  Only the two primary characters, FBI undercover agent Darwyn who infiltrates the terror cell, and the religious fanatic leader of the cell, seem immune from the constant seeking out of prostitutes.  What this series does a great job with is character portrayal.  Instead of the usual all-bad-guy vs all-good-guy kinds of personalities, these characters are carefully created to show the subtle human ambiguities and inconsistencies that make up the typical human being.  So, overall I liked the series quite well from an entertainment standpoint, but could only award 4 stars because of the distractingly loud soundtrack.",1298419200,,1915,4.928348909657321

The extras such as ""Director's Commentary"" are fascinating. I personally enjoy the film's detail towards editing and music throughout the entire series. It is not a sleeper.

2700527,3,B000L43PGQ,"Sleeper Cell's 2nd season is not quite as good as the 1st one, but certainly has its moments.  If you enjoyed the first season you will like this one too.

Sleeper Cell is solid and occasionally thought-provoking entertainment, but not exactly great art.  Michael Ealy is capable but no James Gandolfini.  Since the dialougue is mediocre, Sleeper Cell cannot be compared to The Wire.  That said, Sleeper Cell easily surpasses 95% of what's out there.  And if you're interested in terrorism and/or Islam you will enjoy it.

The best performance and the reason to watch remains Oded Fehr as the charismatic terrorist leader Farik.  His presence so dominated the first season that the show simply could not go on without him, so he continues as a character imprisoned at Guantanomo Bay.

Henri Lubatti also delivers noteworthy performances as Korjeni'---but his part is not especially well written and is detached from the main story-line, which has to do with Al-Sadr and a new cell of sexy young terrorists.",1232668800,,1006,4.976047904191617
2700528,5,B000L43PGQ,"If you liked Season 1, you'll like Season 2.  This is a real thriller.

All the characters that survived Season 1 are back, still as fanatic as ever.  The not-too-bright girlfiend is back, along with in-laws that make things complicated.  Darwyn's parents make short appearances, either approving or disapproving.  The Feds are still powerful but rather inept, and in the end it is up to Darwyn, again, to save the day.

As in Season 1, there is plenty of explicit sex and violence.  The bad guys are really bad, although they display an occasional hint of humanity.  The good guys do a lot of things that are pretty awful, but they're trying to save the U.S.A., so I guess that justifies everything.  The ""girls just wanna have fun"" and never think about how dangerous it might be.  Darwyn looks unhappy and broods most of the time, and finally cracks under the strain.  The body count is at least one per hour.  A little unrealistic, maybe, but totally gripping.

At the end of every episode, I had an overwhelming urge to immediately watch the next one, because I couldn't wait to see what happens next.  Just like Season 1, only more so.",1221696000,10,1141,4.611940298507463

This must have bothered some people, because the second season devolves into moral equivalence, futility, evil Americans and incompetence, where the idea of combating terrorism is equated with the terrorism itself.

If you hated the first season because it supported the War on Terror and viewed the US as the good guys, this may be for you.  If you liked it and expect more of the same, pass this one by.",1211068800,5,672,4.575

2700535,5,B000L43PGQ,"Warning: Spoilers for the 1st and 2nd Season follow.

I recently TiVOed the second and final season of ""Sleeper Cell: American Terror"" (8 episodes) off of Showtime. This show received very little fanfare when it premiered in 2005, but I found it to be the best thing I've ever seen on that channel, with the possible exception of ""Stargate SG-1."" In fact, I think it compares very favorably with the brilliant ""The Wire"" on HBO. Which is my way is saying its one of the best shows ever.

The first episode of season 2 had me off balance at first as I was trying to piece together the ""Previously On"" segments from first season to what was happening now. I obviously missed alot of details about how FBI undercover agent AND pious Muslim Darwyn Al-Said infiltrated an LA based terrorist cell led by charismatic Farik (Ardeth Bay from ""The Mummy"" movies) and ultimately foiled their attack on Dodger Stadium. But some basic facts emerged: Darwyn was emotionally recovering with his girlfriend in San Diego and Farik was in US custody and undergoing interrogation and former cell member Ilija Korjenic had escaped capture and dyed his hair ""Spike"" blonde and was hiding out in the apartment of his hooker girlfriend (who in the first season worked in a music store).

These three characters would not meet again until the final episode but the events and people surrounding them were so interesting you never cared. Darwyn gets asked to make contact with a latino gangbanger who converted to radical Islam in prison (where Darwyn apparently served six months in order to build a creditable cover identity). From there he gets recruited to a new terrorist cell and eventually takes over leadership. He faces new challenges in procuring the materials needed for a new attack (like a surface to air missile launcher) while also occasionally clashing with his new and slightly incompetent FBI handler Russell. After he gets the weapons and explosives, he and his handler have to figure out ways to neutralize them without the rest of the cell noticing. At a couple of points, the FBI is ready to take down the cell, but they wait because some new piece of the puzzle points to a bigger attack and they want the details.

Darwyn also has to deal with some personal problems. One of his cell members turns out to be a closet gay and because of shame about this AND also being a devout Muslim, almost kills a moderate Iman (which would probably bring down the cell prematurely) until Darwyn figures out what is going on. And he also has to deal the employer of the female member of his cell who is exploiting her fragile immigration status for sexual favors. Finally he has to deal with his own girlfriend, who is tired of his undercover work, especially after she gets involved in it after the female member of the cell spots her at a zoo and takes an interest in converting her to Islam.

These aren't the kind of challenges Jack Bauer usually faces. Despite the subject matter, ""Sleeper Cell"" owes more to the groundbreaking series ""Wiseguy"" than ""24."" Darwyn doesn't just take out the bad guys. Like Vinnie Terranova, he becomes one of the bad guys before he brings them down. Darwyn comes by his Muslim faith naturally from his father, so he isn't just staying in cover when he quotes the Quoran. He believes in the teachings of Islam, but makes it very clear in several scenes that he doesn't agree with the radical beliefs of the terrorists. But because you see these terrorists as people, you start to get a sense for why they may believe what they do.

Another difference from ""24"" is that this series takes place over a period of months. Many of the twists and turns of the story surprised me, but on retrospect you can see why things happened that way. You can tell that the writers and producers took great care with the storyline because it unfolds much like a Shakespearean tragedy. No one is safe from the collateral damage caused by the terrorists and the efforts to bring them down. The final confrontation between Darwyn and Farik is breathtaking. Showtime was too cheap to pony up money for more seasons. But ""Sleeper Cell"" went out with a bang. If only the ending of ""The Sopranos"" had been half this satisfying.

I ordered and watched the first season dvds (10 episodes) a few weeks ago. I knew how the story ended, but seeing how it begun was also quite a ride.  The 1st season dvds had 3 commentary tracks that were interesting and a behind the scenes video about the filming of the season finale that was illuminating, if a bit long.  Hopefully the 2nd season dvd extras are as good since I will probably order them and then re-watch them in a year or so.",1193097600,3,4669,4.642857142857143
2700536,5,B000L43PGQ,"I watched season one of Sleeper Cell, and while I liked it I never really clicked with the show. The pace never grabbed me, the character's situations were interesting but not enough to be exciting.

Then came season two. While it is shorter, only eight episodes this time, it makes up for it with thrilling events and an amazing pace.

I'm not sure how early in the season the producers knew they weren't coming back for a third year, but I do think it helped in making season two brilliant. In combination with the fact that they had season one to set up the characters, season two acts as if it has nothing to lose, and just delivers blow after blow after blow. From the first episode to the last minute of the final episode, it keeps on surprising and shocking viewers in ways that it didn't even attempt in season one.

It reminded me of 24 in its first season, when that show had the ability to surprise. But it has more substance, integrity and finesse than 24 has ever had. If you like thrilling TV with 3D characters, then you have to buy this box set.",1187481600,,1061,4.348484848484849
