8447929,4,B004Y5ARJG,"I just read the other reviews of this 2011 film from China that was released on DVD by Film Movement and I have to agree that I liked it but cant quite give it five stars.  I liked the story line of the father (Guilin  named for the most beautiful spot in China) who doesnt want to lose his young daughter when his wife finds a rich lover and wants a divorce. His daughter wants to be a pianist and Guilin says that he will build her one. (This is all before he realizes how many parts a piano has!

He gathers his new girlfriend and group of other friends who have just been laid off from a steel plant and together that actually do build the piano.  (No its not a spoiler  really  yiou know it will happen. The film is a bit long at 1 hour, 40 minutes and sometimes the english subtitles (the dialogue is in Mandarin) go by too quickly (though they have good contrast against the background). Theres quite a bit of dialogue too so you cant always watch the action.
Other reviewers saw a parallel to China coming out of Communism but the film never confirms when it is supposedly taking place.

Im glad I saw it but it doesnt rank high on my must see list.

The DVD also includes a 12 minute award winning animated film from the National Film Board of Canada titled The Necktie. Its colorful but I did have a hard time deciphering the story line.

The whimsical and in a way quite entertaining movie is praised as of the best Chinese movies in recent years. I can see why people say so. A seemingly fragmented family drama on the surface, the movie is more of a eulogy of the bygone era for me.  Set in probably the 1980s when China was going through a massive social transformation from a communist to a state-capitalist society, the film is keen in representing the paradoxes of the era. The contrast of the most well recognized Western musical instrument with the Communist Russian melody, the gray and dilapidated Maoist factory with the colorful trendy clothes women wear, as well as the melancholic overtone of the movie with the sporadic jolly and celebration altogether give an indepth anatomy of the time. Not many Chinese films Ive seen are able to capture the paradoxes and (even) the absurdity of the time like The Piano in a Factory does without any bitterness. It is nostalgic and critical at the same time.",1410825600,3,996,4.724137931034483
8447931,5,B004Y5ARJG,"This film is great for two reasons.

First, the whole film is a fascinating parallel between the story of a man (Guilin) whose family is falling apart and a country whose communist system and ideology is falling apart. Guilin struggles to deal with both problems simultaneously. It's a touching and sympathetic picture of a man fighting for his traditional values in a world that has left them behind. Non-Chinese will have to pay special attention to the historical background of the film to understand the parallels in the plot, but the themes of the film transcend the particulars of the setting. Social values are changing all over the world, perhaps at a faster rate than ever before, and older generations frequently find themselves striving to live their values in a society that considers them outmoded. This film is a masterful exploration of that problem.

Second, this film is funny for both Chinese and American audiences, which is great because comedies often don't translate well.",1353110400,6,994,5.054878048780488
8447932,4,B004Y5ARJG,"From time to time, an independent Chinese director creates a really sweet story - not a martial arts film nor a Chinese epic of the first or last emperor... but a lovely little story of actual Chinese life in a small town.

The film begins with a divorce of a couple. The wife splits with her husband because she can live ""the easy life"" with another man who makes a lot of money selling fake Chinese drugs.  The husband makes a (very) modest income as the leader of a small music band.  His instrument is the accordian.

His young daughter is asked to choose which of her parents she will select.  Because she likes music, she exclaims that she will go with the parent who can provide her with a ""piano.' And so begins the father's madcap race to provide a piano, even if it means creating one from scratch out of scrap metal.  [I won't provide the ending, but there are some surprises]

My favorite scene was one where the musician asks the (quite attractive) female singer of his band to marry him.  She responds why does he ask...and he responds he needs someone to help him take care of his father who is old. When she replies - ""do you want me for myself or want me to be a caretaker"", he answers quite candidly that he really wants her to help him out with his dad because it is the obligation of the young to take care of the old. In a marriage proposal, you will never see ""that"" remark in an American romantic comedy.

I also liked the way the movie was filmed in a realistic setting of a very ordinary industrial town. This added to the authenticity of the film.  Nice entertainment, so four stars.",1324598400,5,1609,4.333333333333333
8447933,5,B004Y5ARJG,I was privileged to have experienced this film. Such a fresh plot and incredible cinematography! Even with the movie being in Mandarin instead of English with subtitles the intention and action was clear. So many different levels that it captivated me from start to finish.,1311292800,6,273,5.088888888888889
