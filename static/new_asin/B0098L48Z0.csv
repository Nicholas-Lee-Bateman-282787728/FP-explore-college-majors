8537593,1,B0098L48Z0,"More of a disjointed travel log thru Sicily looking for a place to shoot a movie re Sicilian puppets.  Also a nod to  Turturro's Sicilian family history.

Vendor took weeks to get the move to me , did not arrive by Christmas  or New Years.  Ordered on the 14th of Dec.",1421539200,,268,4.176470588235294
8537594,3,B0098L48Z0,"Beautifully shot, evocative, elegiac and eloquent in a subdued way, REHEARSAL FOR A SICILIAN TRAGEDY is John Turturros love letter to the land of his roots. Part travelogue, part artistic impression, part documentary and part history lesson, the sum of these parts is a little less interesting than the parts themselves.

Watching the film one might say whats the point? but this is a meaningless question. Whats the point of any art? Turturros vision is simply to discover, celebrate and explore his familial and artistic heritage and you either follow him on this journey or you dont. It is clear he wanted to make this film and you have to admire his laid-back let-things-unfold attitude rather than a desperate gotta-create-some-drama-and-look-good-while-Im-doing-it approach that is the obvious trap when a star makes a film like this one.

REHEARSAL FOR A SICILIAN TRAGEDY is perhaps a slightly misleading title as it vaguely suggests a Mafioso vengeance killing. Instead it offers a gentle, poetic and deeply personal series of vignettes comprising a loosely-structured, dream-like labour of love for Turturro and director Roman Paska. Too often labour of love is an expression used in a condescending manner, suggesting that the labour will have limited commercial appeal and is being done solely for self-gratification. While that description may indeed apply here, labour of love is nonetheless used by this reviewer respectfully. The film may not be completely successful nor will it appeal to everyone, but when an artist as rightfully revered as John Turturro offers up something so personally relevant, it behooves a thinking audience to watch and listen.",1397433600,2,1669,5.342205323193916
8537595,5,B0098L48Z0,"John Tuturro's performance is intimate and masterful. He shows the joy and passion of an authentic Sicilan experience.  . The art of Sicilian Puppetry is magnificent, although it is underappreciated. Few know that it is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list. A most memorable film and deeply satisfying. Congratulations to First Run Films.",1388793600,,349,5.462962962962963
8537596,5,B0098L48Z0,This was a great documentary to give me insight into the Sicilian culutre.  I can't wait to see if his project idea becomes a reality!,1366156800,2,134,4.36
8537597,3,B0098L48Z0,I enjoyed John Turturro's delving into and sharing his learning of the artform of Sicilian puppetry. Most people don't know how it came about and why.  John helped us to really learn more about it. I am a daughter of a Sicilian immigrant and have been studying the history of all aspects of the island as well as researching my family ancestry. It helped me add more to what I've already researched. I recommend this DVD.,1362355200,,421,4.5394736842105265
