Iraq: Cradle of Civilization The host stands in the Iraqi desert amid crumbling ruins describing a thriving city and a network of lush canals. All that remains of Uruk is a sea of golden sand, the complex city abandoned except for the caretaker and his family. But it was here that men and women built the first civilization.

India: The Empire of the Spirit The traditions that are honored by millions of Indians (including more than 100,000 Indian Muslims) were born in the Indus valley 5,000 years ago. Sumptuously beautiful footage in this comprehensive look at Indian civilization.

Egypt: The Habit of Civilization Ancient Egypt was the first great nation on earth, and it has endured for thousands of years. Ancient traditions come together in the Muslim culture that is the Middle East today.

Barbarian West This episode traces the origins of western culture, noting that its triumph was the result of its borrowing from the legacies of these ancient civilizations, and borrowings from the Muslim civilization of the Middle Ages.

China: Mandate of Heaven and Central America: Burden of Time
