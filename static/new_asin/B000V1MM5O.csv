8216169,3,B000V1MM5O,"""The Return..."" is a sequel - and like most sequels is a failed attempt to ""repeat"" a masterpiece - ""the Tall Blond Man"" (in this case).  But that's why they are marsterpieces, that each one is unique and even the same team of stars will never be able to reproduce it. The same is true with remakes.",1279929600,2,299,4.245614035087719
8216170,5,B000V1MM5O,Very funny movie on par with the first one. Just the beginning of the movie is worth the price of the DVD. The product came on time and in excellent condition even though it is in Russian there was no problem in setting it up.,1278633600,3,226,4.044444444444444
8216171,5,B000V1MM5O,"""The Return Of The Tall Blond Man"" (1974) directed by Yves Robert is one of the most incredible things that could happen in the world of movies - it is a sequel that works, that is as funny (and sometimes funnier) as the original and is almost as clever and bright as the first movie. The soundtrack is simply unbelievable. Pierre Richard, who once again is expected to be a naive pawn, fights back with his own plan which involves so many hilarious acts of physical comedy that they may fill the movie twice as long as this brilliant Return of one of the best comedies ever made. This is the movie to rewatch and enjoy over and over again.",1199232000,5,640,4.341666666666667
