2470124,4,B000CQQIZ8,This DVD is both informative and interesting. The only query I have is that there is too little information on the origins of the Celts.,1215907200,2,136,4.48
2470125,5,B000CQQIZ8,"I have watched this show on History International, so when I saw it in dvd format I knew I wanted it.  Don't look for an in-depth study of the Celts on this dvd.  At only fifty minutes long that would not be possible.  However, this dvd gives a good overview of ancient Celtic culture.  The computer animations are entertaining and the information is presented well.  This is the best dvd on ancient Celtic culture I have found to date.",1168300800,27,436,4.468354430379747
8100680,2,B000CQQIZ8,"Considering this disc's 'release date' is listed as 2006; I'm curious to know why it does not comply with the American's with Disabilities Law of 1993, in that it does NOT have closed captioning? I am hearing impaired, can't assess whether the information is useful or informative, becase it isn't captioned. This disc is worthless to me. Frustrated.",1486944000,,350,5.051724137931035
