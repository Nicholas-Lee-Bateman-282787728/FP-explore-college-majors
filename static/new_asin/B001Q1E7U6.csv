8334923,4,B001Q1E7U6,"Surprisingly decent movie about martial arts from the early 90's that I would've passed on due to the lame title...but after reading the two earlier reviews on Amazon, I decided to check it out thinking I'd just skim through it for 5 minutes and be done with it. Not the case, I ended up watching the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed it for its entertainment value and 90's nostalgia cheesy one-liners and 'villain'. If you enjoy the fight flicks from the 80-90's....i.e. Stallone, Van Damme, and Karate Kid and its knockoffs, then you can't go wrong with it one. Awesome montages, master/student players, silly 'evil' villain, and so forth...90's hidden gem!!",1525132800,,662,4.972972972972973
8334924,4,B001Q1E7U6,"""College Kickboxers"" is a low-budget martial arts flick released during the golden age of home video that has since all but slipped out of awareness among even devoted B-movie fans. Like its main star Ken McLeod, it's an unrefined but thoroughly competent little actioneer which, with more publicity, could've become the cult favorite Black Belt Magazine predicted it would be, in a 1993 issue wherein it was mentioned favorably alongside the likes of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;trilogy and a couple of Bruce Lee's classics. It's definitely got its faults (not to mention a long line of quirks), but kick for kick, it's still a great example of the effort and ingenuity you rarely see in modern karate fare.

The story: martial arts-practicing college freshman James Caulfield (McLeod,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown/dp/B000BNUFQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown</a>) finds himself the target of the racist White Tiger gang because of his friendship with a black dojo leader (Mark Williams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Fight/dp/6304534418/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Fight</a>). Attacked one night, he's rescued by a Chinese sifu moonlighting as a cook (Tang Tak Wing, action director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Supercop/dp/B001F0TM3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Supercop</a>). Desperate to beat his attackers in an upcoming tournament, he begs the master for tutelage, and in receiving it will learn more about himself than he imagined.

The remainder of Ken McLeod's film career would be limited to supporting roles and bit parts wherein he played second fiddle to Don 'the Dragon' Wilson, Kenn Scott, Billy Blanks, Gary Daniels, and Cynthia Rothrock; he helped make their movies interesting, but it's a shame that he never got another starring vehicle considering his awesome physical performance in this one. Looking younger and much more powerful than Jean-Claude Van Damme ever did, his swift and sturdy forms are very fun to watch. He's matched, however, by Tang Tak Wing, who's clearly channeling Sammo Hung by moving with unbelievable speed and grace for a stout fellow. Together, they form a pretty cool short-term team of which the only fault is that they don't fight nearly enough for my liking. Of the half-dozen brawls shared between them (plus an extended montage of tournament fights), only two last longer than ten seconds. Considering how above-average the choreography is, this comes across as a thoroughly unappreciated tease.

Not unlike the aforementioned ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" flicks, ""College Kickboxers"" is sufficiently weird enough to alienate people who aren't up to venturing into the strange world the film takes place in. The movie is populated by disturbingly obsessive people: James goes against all common sense in his ambition to be trained by Sifu Wing, the girl he tries to woo (Kendra Tucker) is an environmentalist knight who only goes for him when he happens to learn acupuncture, and the leader of the White Tiger gang (Matthew Ray Cohen) - aside from breaching some kind of overacting law - is an outspoken racist who nevertheless features Asian actor Harry Mok (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TC-2000/dp/6302814316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TC 2000</a>) in his band, a group whose sole purpose seems to be walking around looking for fights. To train, James is instructed to strike forms while barefoot in an ice skating rink, play the hand-slap game with his teacher, and jump out of a hole in the sand while his knees are held stiff. Oh, and Sifu Wing makes a miniature crop circle of a yin-yang symbol in the grass while practicing forms. It's all in a day's work in the lives of these weird, weird characters.

To my surprise, the film conveys its lesson of humility with a level of subtlety practically unseen in action flicks - a pretty sophisticated touch as far as these kinds of movies go. To counter this, however, the acting is roundly questionable and, again, I wish the fight scenes had been longer. What's there is definitely cult-worthy material, though, and anybody daring enough to see the breakout of one of kung fu cinema's finest could-have-beens should try to hunt this one down.

8334925,5,B001Q1E7U6,I liked this movie very much and the way teacher or the chef from restaurant teaches student from college and they both work at the same restaurant bonus. In so doing so he can defeat the enemy and gang or goons which there always is in a martial arts movie. Hope there more of this kind which there usually is the other i can think of is the one with Billy blanks in showdown with Patrick kilpatrick and the teaches the student from high school who beaten by the school bully but he beat him at the end so you fans anyone of these are classics and still are so watch them if you can.
