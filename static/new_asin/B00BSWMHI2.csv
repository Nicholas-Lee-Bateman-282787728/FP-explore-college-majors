8573420,2,B00BSWMHI2,"Ive purchased this dvd twice now, with the hope that the audio sync issue would be remedied. While the second copy is much better, the audio is still slightly out of sync. Its definitely watchable, though. The story, in the beginning, is interesting, so Id recommend giving it a try, even if only to see the lovely Rungano Nyoni. But don't expect to come away with any wam feelings about this film. It quickly goes from interesting to tedious, and the ending is a real letdown.",1509580800,,477,4.558139534883721
8573421,3,B00BSWMHI2,"A man (Axel Wedekind) wakes up imprisoned in a cell with a big iron door. There is a set of locked lockers, a light, and a dead rat. He struggles to get out, forced to drink his own urine and eat maggots to survive. He meets a African woman (Rungano Hyoni) who does not speak English.

The film reminded me of a low budget ""Cube"" without the booby traps. The question of why they are there is semi-answered at the end, i.e. you get a visual explanation you need to interpret. The acting was fine, but I would of liked to have seen less lamenting and more action, i.e. solving clues, breaking through walls etc.

A film for those who would visually want to combine ""Buried"" with ""Cube."" Once you get to the end, you realize that the film can be watched on a different level. Those who are capable of grasping the ""smartness"" of the film would rate it higher than those that don't get it.
