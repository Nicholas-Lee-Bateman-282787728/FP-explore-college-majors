7831765,1,6302761336,"It is absolutely unbelievable how truly awful this film is--'Frozen Assets' is easily one of the WORST films ever made. This movie is so bad that it's beyond comprehension.
(Almost worth seeing for the broad strokes of undiluted incompetence this film was brushed with.)",1040515200,2,270,5.159090909090909
7831766,3,6302761336,This is a typical Shelly Long movie in which she plays a small town doctor assisting those with fertility problems.  In comes Corben Bernsen and Larry Miller and the antics begin.  This movie is a feel good movie that is  incredibly funny in its simplicity.,946944000,5,257,4.666666666666667
