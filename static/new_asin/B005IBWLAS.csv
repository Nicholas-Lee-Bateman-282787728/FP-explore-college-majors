8474500,3,B005IBWLAS,"Of this collection, I have only seen ""Selling Murder: The Killing Films of the Third Reich,"" which is a painfully disturbing look at depraved disregard for the sanctity of human life.  As is well known, leaders - and followers - deluded themselves into believing the atrocious lie that they had the right to decide who was to live and who was to die.  First focusing on people who were ill or disabled, they tried to convince others - and themselves - that what they were doing was virtuous!  As explained by the History Place,

* ""In October of 1939 amid the turmoil of the outbreak of war Hitler ordered widespread `mercy killing' of the sick and disabled....On August 3, 1941, a Catholic Bishop, Clemens von Galen, delivered a sermon in Mnster Cathedral attacking the Nazi euthanasia program calling it `plain murder.'  The sermon sent a shockwave through the Nazi leadership by publicly condemning the program and urged German Catholics to `withdraw ourselves and our faithful from their (Nazi) influence so that we may not be contaminated by their thinking and their ungodly behavior'....The Nazis retaliated against the Bishop by beheading three parish priests who had distributed his sermon....The use of gas chambers at the euthanasia killing centers ultimately served as [heinous] training centers for the SS. They used the technical knowledge and experience gained during the euthanasia program to construct huge killing centers at Auschwitz, Treblinka and other concentration camps in an attempt to exterminate the entire Jewish population of Europe"" (Nazi Euthanasia, The History Place, 1996).

While alerting us to the horrors of Nazi Euthanasia, ""Selling Murder: The Killing Films of the Third Reich,"" then takes an unfortunate editorial shift and seems to imply that better advance planning with families might have legitimized the killings of people who were ill or disabled!  Absolutely not so!",1431993600,,1911,5.2254901960784315
