3665691,4,B000J3Q9NU,"No matter where you live, or how far away you are from home, you must always follow your passions, for they will guide you on your path through life. This is the lesson I learned from the film ""A Touch of Spice"", which I recently discovered in my search for Greek films released in America, and is one of the highest grossing Greek films of all time.  For the main character, Fanis Iakovides, this passion is food.  It's a passion taught to him by his grandfather, who owns a spice shop in Istanbul that Fanis frequents as a young boy.  Grandfather teaches Fanis the power and passion found in spices, a lesson which sticks with him as he is deported back to Greece with his family, away from his grandfather.

Fanis' natural skills as a cook are discouraged by those around him as he grows into adolescence, as is his recent immigration from Turkey. Despite being Greek citizens, his family is frequently viewed as outsiders, and this sense of alienation and longing to return to a home that no longer exists is one of the main themes of this film. Fanis soon grows up and becomes a professor of astronomy, but that longing remains. He returns to Istanbul as an adult, seeking to reconnect with the passions of his youth, including his first love, Saime. Thankfully, this film does not turn into some saccharine fairy tale, but remains grounded in the truths of real life, that we don't always get the things we think we want, but usually end up getting just what we need.

Skillfully directed by Tassos Boulmetis, A Touch of Spice convincingly chronicles Fanis' life from childhood to adulthood and all the geographical and political changes he experiences. Beautifully shot, the filmmakers' passion for the region and its people shines through. (And all the delicious food on display doesn't hurt either, though it may make you hungry!) The alluring George Corraface leads a skilled trio of actors who portray Fanis through the years, and the family and friends who surround him are all uniquely drawn and immediately interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed A Touch of Spice, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a film both heartfelt and mouth-watering!",1265241600,13,2155,4.782258064516129
3665692,5,B000J3Q9NU,"Touching, beautiful, emotional and deep while at the same time funny.
The story of two cities, Athens and Istanbul, is revolving around the habits and behavior of the Greeks living in Istanbul and moving to Greece to live there after some political turmoil in the 50s.
The story starts with young Fanis in Istanbul, his introduction to many aspects of life by his family either in the kitchen or in the spice stores of his grandfather and ends there many years later when the grandfather is dieing.
Through these years, Fanis became a professor of astronomy but never forgot his first love in Istanbul, a beautiful young Turkish neighbor and all the teaching by his grandfather.
The photography is exceptional captivating and makes you just ready to visit both cities.
This very same photography is full of symbolism with the camera moving freely into the space and the essence of the locations, capturing the binding elements of the two cities and the people.
The music is magnificent and again is able to identify common themes, sounds and tunes that link the two countries.
The kitchen is of course the centerpiece of the action.
Cooking is not just a necessity; it is the very essence of family gathering, decision-making, fun, challenge, and family life.
This film identified some strong similarities of both peoples and presented them in a wonderful emotional and realistic way.
Hospitality, the importance of the family, cooking and eating as a means of social and family strengthening, love and respect are all aspects that link the two people.
In fact, once we saw this film we started cooking a lot more dishes from the ""Istanbul Cuisine"" or as the title of the film in Greek is ""Politiki Kouzina "" which means just that.",1167523200,4,1731,4.871186440677966

3665694,4,B000J3Q9NU,This movie is really a great one.  I am glad that it was available by China for release to the rest of the world.  The only thing I wish it had was subtitles in English.,1144972800,2,169,3.8
3665695,4,B000J3Q9NU,"The unsetting in a place question may become a true dislocation of our emotional and affective coordinates. Nostalgia and eagerness are our inseparable journey `s partners.

This is what it occurs when a little boy suffers in live flesh, the abominable and for him absolutely inexplicable consequences of the conflict Turkey Greece. And his love for spices is a clear refugee and evasion respect the adults world. But when he grew up, his passion will endure still. Old affects and hidden memories will blossom when they meet one each other years later. But the life as the show, must go on.

The admirable emotive traces left behind by Cinema Paradise or Like water for chocolate would seem to reborn in this sympathetic movie with some additive elements of the best Fellini and the sensitive influence of the Italian Neo Realism.

A good opportunity to enjoy a lyric picture with the enrapturing Istanbul as curtain of frame.",1141084800,,927,4.92948717948718
3665696,3,B000J3Q9NU,"If your list of favorites movies includes Life is beautiful, Cinema Paradiso and Il Postino; Touch of spice is the perfect movie for you: a  over sentimental  tale of a boy unable to find himself welcome in the two cities of his life: Istambul and Athens. A turk in Greece and a greek in Turkey, young Fanis can only find himself at home in the kitchen  making the recipes that he learned from the women of his family, and from his dear grandfather, who teached him about spices  while teaching him about the wonders of the universe.

A  love story about a city, Istambul, the movie is a delight while young Fanis is a young boy: the family is loving and funny, and you can almost smell the cooking; but as he grows and turns into a middle age science wiz who can't forget not  his childhood city, neither the beautiful girl he left behind; the movie becomes too mellow, too sweet, too predictable.

It  just missed the right spice.",1140825600,12,932,4.435294117647059
3665697,5,B000J3Q9NU,"Fanis is a young Greek boy growing up in Istanbul, whose grandfather, who owns a grocery shop, teaches him that both food and life require a little salt to give them flavour. The scene were his grandfather makes a representation of the universe with different spices is inspirational cinematography.

You may say that Fanis' character is the alter ego of Tassos Boulmetis, the film's director, because much of the film is a reflection of his own life. His alter ego in the film is Fanis Iakovidis played by George Chorafas. He's a professor of astronomy at a Greek University. He lives in Palaio Faliro (a neighbourhood of Athens, by the sea, that has many people from Constantinople up to this day). An incident, namely another postponed arrival of his grandfather, provokes memories of growing up in Constantinople with his grandfather who had a spice shop.

When Fanis and his family are deported from Turkey because they are Greek citizens his grandfather and his young friend Saime are left behind. In Greece he and his family are seen as foreigners, not Greek at all. As a result Fanis builds his own world isolating himself, and on the meantime he expresses himself by cooking delicious meals.

I would also like to make a special reference to Fanis uncle Emilios, who is a sailor and he has traveled all over the world and he seems to be the most opened-minded person in the movie. A very well depicted character indeed.

The film becomes extremely interesting when Fanis returns to Constantinople and goes to the places he spent part of his childhood and also meets his first love. A great movie to watch, full of nostalgie giving an objective look in two countries (Greece and Turkey) that have so many historical differences yet they resemble so much.",1134172800,11,1762,4.805280528052806

3665703,4,B000J3Q9NU,"Interesting story - good show of what it might be like being from one place while ""being"" from another, and not being enough from either place, no matter where one goes.

A bit jarring going from Greek in the beginning to English later in the flick - further proof you can't really go back?

Great food imagery.

Worthwhile add to my food flick collection.",1364774400,,356,4.53125
3665704,5,B000J3Q9NU,"While shows and explains many aspects of the Greek culture , links it with a true love story that time and unexpected events try to erase . From childhood to maturity , the impact of family values and culture prevail in daily life and choices of all the characters . A soft political background is given , and enhances the whole story . Passion is fully explored ... no matter which , be it either family , abilities , work , or somone you love . And above all , teaches that passions , may and shall have a good reason beneath , if are based upon the values and good examples we acquire in childhood . A wonderfull and true love story . Of course the fact of being from Greek origin influenced my view , nevetheless shared by others I've recommended .",1317081600,2,752,4.229166666666667
3665705,2,B000J3Q9NU,"A family movie at it's core , Touch Of Spice tells the story of Fanis , who has to leave Istanbul at an early age for Athens , due to the difficult relationships between Greece and Turkey . The memories that have stayed in his mind more than anything , are the stories , recipies and knowledge about cooking his grandfather used to tell him , the time the two were spending together . At 45 , our hero has to go back in order to visit his grandpa who has suddently fallen ill .

The film had been one of the biggest hits of greek cinema in the past decade yet it's a strangely harmless , spineless proposition , totally apolitikal and rather mellow . Director Tasos Boulmentis has chosen to take as few risks as possible . Considering the huge iamount of money the production costed ( for greek standards always ) , maybe that's not so unexpected .

A Touch Of Spice avoids to examine the sensitive issues of that period in Greece's history . The script fails to convicingly present the simple love themes it choses to tell as well . When Fanis fo back to Istanbul , he meets a childhood friend played by the gorgeous turkish actress Basak Kklkaya . She used to dance for him in his grandfather's attic when they where little . She has never stopped loving him , she says and sheds a tear...ah come on! Weren't they , like , seven year olds when they last met ? Both Chorafas and Kklkaya are talented and beautiful yet they are given little to work with . As for the rest of the characters , they all remain strictly one dimensional as well through out the whole movie .

Overall ,the movie is sweet , nostalgic , feel good and withought any edge ( salt ? pepper ? ) whatsoever . More of a lost opportunity than a hit and miss then .",1313539200,3,1733,4.213855421686747
3665706,5,B000J3Q9NU,Fantastic movie with a soft touch. I have recommended this movie to several friends and colleagues and the response has been excellent.,1277424000,8,135,5.181818181818182
3665707,5,B000J3Q9NU,"This film was really inspiring and encouraging. It is about following your passion, no matter what. This Greek film touches not only on the importance of cooking and following your dreams, but also on the importance of family. The main character in this film has a strong passion for cooking which was passed on to him from his grandfather. His grandfather owns a spice ship and teaches him how to use spices in making tasty and flavorful foods. When he is deported and forced to move away from his grandfather, his passion becomes even stronger. Even though he is discouraged from being a cook a lot of the time, he endures and continues to work towards his goals.
While the story has its ups and downs, it remains real and raw throughout the duration. It is about real life and the struggles that individuals must go through in order to maintain their happiness and the happiness of their families as well. Not only was the story beautiful, but the cinematography was too. Overall this was a great movie to watch from start to finish. I didn't want it to end!",1271980800,6,1061,4.589473684210526
