1707651,5,B000065U2F,I first saw The Beiderbecke Affair and the other 2 in the series on PBS Mystery and loved it right away.  The story and characters are wonderful. The Chemsity between Jill (Barbara Flynn) and Trevor (James Bolam) is very wity. Anyone who can spend a little time watching this series will be adding it to their collection. The Beidebecke Series is one of my top 10 films.,1151712000,2,370,4.522388059701493
1707652,4,B000065U2F,"Alan Plater's stories are always just on the verge of being a little too cute. The dialogue is sometimes too clever by half, but more often than not, it actually works. So I can understand if the Beiderbecke series is not to everyone's liking. After happening on the series on tv, I had to find the books. I've read the trilogy at least five times since I found a paperback copy in London in 1994 (at Books, Etc., which was replaced by Borders and is still on Charing Cross Road near Tottenham Court Rd.).

The Beiderbecke Affair is my favorite of the three Beiderbecke stories (The Beiderbecke Tapes and The Beiderbecke Connection are the second and third of the series). We are introduced to Trevor and Jill, Big Al and Little Norm, the gang at school, and the mostly incompetent bunch at the police station. Why has a beautiful platinum blonde offered to sell jazz records to Trevor? What do Big Al and Little Norm have to hide? How are Jill's English students getting extra copies of Tess of the D'Urbervilles? And how does Bix Beiderbecke fit in?

As you may guess, the mystery is secondary in these stories. The appeal is the interplay among the characters and the running gags. The music is a big plus in the video versions, with an excellent band playing the songs of Leon ""Bix"" Beiderbecke, jazz musician of The Twenties, who died tragically young, and whose cornet playing inspires Trevor and occasionally other characters, but alas, never Jill.

Start with the The Beiderbecke Affair, not just because it is the first of the series, but because it is the best story.",1121126400,7,1577,4.66546762589928
1707653,5,B000065U2F,"Properly-done British humor, as I frequently explain to acquaintances who are puzzled by it, is probably an acquired taste. It's certainly more subtle and intellectual than your average sitcom -- Yank or Brit -- and even when it's topical, its popularity is likely to last. This is Series One of a terrific comedy-mystery featuring a clutch of character actors who are not in the Hollywood mold. In fact, I had never before come across James Bolam, who plays Trevor Chaplin, public school woodworking teacher in West Yorkshire, and I only knew Barbara Flynn (Jill Swinburne, English teacher at the same school and Environmentalist Party candidate for the town council) from her supporting role as Mrs. Maigret, and from _Lorna Doone_ and _The Forsyte Saga_. Dudley Sutton was an old favorite from the _Lovejoy_ series, and Colin Blakely has been marvelous in nearly all his many roles. The dialogue is frequently off-the-wall, especially when Jill and Trevor are dealing with the officious Headmaster or the semi-clueless Det. Sgt. Hobson, B.A. (a ""graduate copper,"" beautifully played by Dominic Jephcott), and their cautious personal relationship is believable and endearing. Trevor isn't actually as limp as he might at first seem, and Jill isn't nearly so independently fearless and self-sufficient as she would like to believe. The plot is also just this side of terminally bizarre, involving the ""gray economy"" (which Big Al refers to as the ""white economy,"" in an attempt to improve its image) and the lengths to which the Powers That Be will go to subvert its influence, the reappearance in Trevor's life of his old flame, Helen of Tadcaster, and a retired bookie's runner (with his dog, Jason) who tries, not very successfully, to make a buck as a police informant. But another major character in the series is the blighted landscape of urban Yorkshire, staring out at you as Trevor and Jill tootle around town in his delapidated minivan. Finally, the very last scene, ""running downhill in slow motion,"" is almost worth the price of admission all by itself!",1057017600,29,2066,5.079411764705882
1707654,3,B000065U2F,"Given the dire quality of the recent VHS-only releases by Granada Media in the UK, I was pleased to find this American DVD issue.
However it's not all good news: the prints used are noticeably grainy & scratchy - particularly in the first couple of episodes. Clearly no attempt has been made to polish them up, let alone remaster the series. The dialogue track, however, has been ""cleaned up"" on the first episode - presumably in an attempt to remove background hiss. Sadly this has been done rather amateurishly and results in unnatural silences during pauses in dialogue.
Although the episodes are complete, a minor but puzzling point is that the end titles for segments 1 and 3 have been removed.
Overall, then, while I applaud Goldhil for issuing the series on silver disk, the set isn't worth its normal retail price. The prints used might have been acceptable for VHS but their flaws are quite apparent on DVD. Lack of proper extras don't help, either.
Hopefully this wonderful series will receive the quality of release it deserves one day. In the meantime, however, Goldhil's attempt is certainly better than nothing!",1043712000,16,1125,4.895287958115183

1707708,5,B000065U2F,"On the trilogy UK edition: There are no extras and the film quality is good, but not crystal clear (remember this was made before the digital age really took off). Typical of its time, this is a slow-paced, sedate, gentle, wry comedy. Today's MTV generation may find it a little toooo slow.

The three stories that make up the trilogy are executed with varying degrees of success. The first, about the ""grey"" economy (buying and selling ""legitimate"" merchandise, without all the hassle of taxes and shops rents and the kind of secret handshaking that goes on between big businesses to control the market) is the best. Trevor Chaplin's purchase of some jazz records does not go as expected. Worse, the people he's bought them from are being investigated by the police. In order to extricate himself from the mess, he and his partner, Jill Swinburn, together with Big Al and Little Norm, must deal with corruption and collusion between big business, the local council and the boys in blue (the police).

The second, the Beiderbecke Tapes, is the least satisfactory, partly due to a compromise in Location (Edinburgh substituted for Venice) and partly because the chase sequence, being very laboured, outstays its welcome very quickly. Mostly, however, it's because the McGuffin at the center of the story is totally senseless.

The final story, the Beiderbecke Connection, returns the duo to Leeds and Wakefield and their association with Big Al and Little Norm. The story is more satisfying, because it's on a much more realistic level. Jill and Trevor take in a refugee for Al and Norm, ignorant of the fact that he's wanted by the police. The plot leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth these days, where cybercrime and financial irregularities are taken much more seriously, but even back then, this was the most cynical and scathing outlook on British culture, the tone coming dangerously close to its contemporary, A Very Peculiar Practice.

The stories are deliberately slight and understated. This is light comedy, producing wry, knowing smiles, gently parodying hard crime dramas and, more prosaically, the teaching profession. At its best, the warmth of the relationship between Jill and Trevor, their astute, sardonic commentary and the portrayal of the British way of life as one of adversity in the face of overwhelming stupidity, are what carry the audience forward.

Recommended, but don't expect belly laughs or high drama.",1291507200,,2439,5.072319201995012
1707709,4,B000065U2F,"Yes, I suppose there is sufficient ""unknown"" to qualify this mini-series as a mystery; however, that is purely a technical definition. To most of us, it relies so little on that component in its content, that ""comedy"" is definitely how a potential viewer should view what he or she is getting. As a comedy, it makes the grade as a low keyed, somewhat off-beat vehicle, likely to capture the average viewer (who does not approach it with the notion of getting a Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple or Inspector Morse). Ignore the blurbs, this is by no means, The Thin Man or even MacMillan and Wife. It is a mildly wry, modestly dry, comedy which earns some chuckles, a few chortles, but mostly bare smiles and a moderately good feeling. The players are properly British, quite competent and mostly on target with something less than satire, more than straight. The creative staff has seen to the quality of writing, directing and scenic design. At least on an ordinary, not hyper-charged, TV and disc player, the picture and sound show no defects of the generation it has aged since its first production. All-in-all, a decent show, with a happy feel to it, which promises to be entertaining to most who do not come primed for suspense, shoot-em-up or excitement.",1284336000,,1254,4.783410138248848
1707710,1,B000065U2F,"An earlier Amazon reviewer described the writing of this British series as brilliant.  Another reviewer noted the resemblance of the two main protagonists to Nick and Nora Charles.  A third reviewer professed to find a family resemblance to the Monty Python series.

Such comments clearly demonstrate that Amazon reviewers are as likely to espouse preposterous notions as anyone else.

How do I despise this series?  Let me count the ways:

The writing is universally dull, repetitive, pompous, illogical and profoundly, appallingly, grimly unfunny.

The actors, some of whom have shown competence elsewhere, display themselves as frighteningly inept here.  This might be the fault of the writing, the direction or even the actors themselves.  Having suffered through this dismal swamp of a series, I have become convinced that all three are equally to blame.

The plot--I'm virtually sure there was one--ranged somewhere between ethereal and twee.  And, of course, I mean this in the very worst sense.

To anyone who truly enjoys dull, illogical, unfunny, twee scripts, especially those which are poorly directed and ineptly acted, this is definitely your thing.  Five stars for you, and welcome to them!

For myself, though, I'll content myself by awarding one star and regretting that I cannot cut that in half.

1707711,5,B000065U2F,"The Beiderbecke Affair (and the sequels) are kind of puzzling at first.  You just don't know what is going on; why did someone actually make such an odd film?  But then the strange occurrences start getting to you.  The off-beat characters, the strange events, the odd relationship between Jill and Trevor (and the blonde woman selling stuff) start bringing you in.

Highly recommended.  Once the police get involved (do they?), this is just so funny.  I was hooked.  How come I had to stumble across this?  I've never heard of Beiderbecke, but these discs are just fantastic.  'Death at a funeral' (the original) and 'Joking Apart' are two other great Brit humorous films that just don't get their just due.

1707712,5,B000065U2F,"You can't beat great writing--and you don't find it often in television. When you do, you want to give a shout to the world which is why I heartily recommend The Beiderbecke Affair.

I fell in love with Alan's work with Oliver's Travels. Those who enjoyed that series will no doubt want to try this one as the same elements of mystery, comedy, romance, and farce (not to mention philosophy of life) are found in this series. Two teachers who are romantically inclined who find themselves involved with the mysterious doings of a platinum blonde, promised jazz albums, and council elections have to deal with the police, a past romantic encounter, and scores of memorable characters in order to discover their true feelings for each other.

This is British writing at its finest but be forewarned--the writer isn't going to spoon-feed you 'action'. Instead, he leads you up and down so many paths that you can't possibly see how they will all tie in until the final episode. The accents are a bit cumbersome, so I suggest tuning the volume a bit higher. A second viewing allows you pick up something you may have missed due to mumbling or dialect.

If you are looking for pure mystery, you may find this tedious for it's so much more. I'd buy it just to hear 'Big Al' give his view on politics and life!

We finished the series last night and immediately ordered the second series. As the third one is due out shortly, I am sure we'll be purchasing that as well. If you like British series, appreciate great writing, and are willing to 'ponder' a bit while watching a show, this series may just be for you.",1264809600,,1605,4.581881533101045
1707713,5,B000065U2F,"Trevor is a woodwork teacher in a North of England state school. He has no ambition and is interested in only three things, football (soccer), his lover Jill, who teaches English at the same school, and Jazz. One night he buys a set of Bix Beiderbeche records from a blond door to door salewomen who is raising money for the local boy scount group. When the records do not turn out to Bix Beiderbecke, Trevor and Jill who is also a Green candidate for the town council, get to meet the brothers Big Al and Little Norm. Big Al is an unemployed buiding worker who runs the black economy in the town from a garden shed and a local church. Big Al however calls it the White Economy in order to improve its image.

Believing that Trevor, Jill. Big Al and Little Norm are criminals all four are targeted by a local police officer.
This leads in the end to the true criminals being unmasked, but not before we have come across such people as Helen of Tadcaster (Trevor's Ex), Mr Carter a cynical history teacher, the local Police Chief and a dog walking old age pensioner who would like to be a police informer, except he has nothing to inform.

If all this sounds a little daft, it is. It is also very funny, very gentle and very British or to more true, very north of England.

James Bolam (New Tricks, When the Boat Comes In and The Likely Lads) and Barbara Flynn (Family at War, Cracker and Maigret) are well know actors on British TV, they are great as Trevor and Jill, as are Dudley Sutton as Mr Carter, Colin Blakney as the Police Chief and Terence Rigby as Big Al.

The Beiderbecke Affair was followed by the Beiderbecke Tapes and the Beiderbeche Connection all of which follow with the same off beat, laid back humour.",1252540800,3,1720,4.39937106918239
1707714,4,B000065U2F,"""The Beiderbecke Affair,"" a box set of a light-hearted British television mystery series, was made by Yorkshire Television for Britain's Independent Television stations (ITV).  The six-episode series was broadcast on PBS in this country in the 1990's, along with its sequels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beiderbecke-Tapes/dp/0413603407/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beiderbecke Tapes</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Connection/dp/B000083C5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Connection</a>.  It was created by the award-winning Alan Plater, one of Britain's more prolific, entertaining writers, and centers on a pair of wisecracking schoolteachers caught up in some amateur sleuthing.

The series is set, and filmed in the city of Leeds, in Yorkshire, a place we don't hardly ever see over here.  (Though, warning to the wise, we don't hardly ever hear Yorkshire accents over here, either, and that's what the cast is using.  And there are no subtitles).  Anyway, Trevor Chaplin, our protagonist, is also actually a transplanted Geordie, from further North, up Newcastle, Hadrian's Wall way, (upon which friends and acquaintances comment), with his own accent.  As played by James Bolam (""New Tricks,"" ""The End of the Affair""), he's a jazz-loving, kind of befuddled, but witty everyman woodworking teacher.  And apparently he hasn't reflected upon the fact that beautiful, well-dressed platinum blonds seldom go selling door to door, until he buys a bunch of Beiderbecke records - that's vinyl records, and there are also no cell phones, only phone boxes - from one.  The Beiderbecke records fail to turn up (Beiderbecke was an early American jazz great of the 1920's), and Trevor goes looking into things with his girlfriend and fellow teacher, who's running on the green line for town council, Jill Swinburne (Barbara Flynn, Mrs. Cracker, from the long-running mystery series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cracker-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001JXPC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cracker: The Complete Collection</a>).

The mystery's kind of light-weight, not exactly watertight, and moves along in a leisurely British fashion, but it will get round to gray-market goods hidden in a church basement, secret meetings on level 4 of a multi-story car park, and corruption at the highest local levels. The banter's consistently witty, and so is the sound track, inspired by Beiderbecke's work, by the award-winning musician Frank Ricotti.  Co-stars include Dominic Jephcott (""The Scarlet Pimpernel."")  There's also a substantial number of those sturdy British supporting players: Colin Blakely, Dudley Sutton, Terence Rigby, and James Grout, among others.

The episodes in this series are:

2.  ""Can anybody join in?"" A newly-minted, university graduate cop (Jephcott), has his suspicions.
3.  ""We call it the white economy."" The plot thickens.
4.  ""Um...I know what you're thinking.""  And gets thicker still, as Helen McAllister, a wealthy, well-connected former girlfriend of Trevor's, suddenly shows up.
5.  ""That was a very funny evening."" Helen and Jill go out to dinner together and put away a lot of champagne.  They toss a coin for Trevor, and Helen wins...
6. ""We are on the brink of a new era.  If only....""City council elections, and dirty tricks.

7961289,3,B000065U2F,"Charming characters, extremely likeable cast, very welcome dashes of dry wit, and cozy settings can't make up for the fact that this first series moves at a snails pace.  There is a peppy jazz score throughout that would be very fun if it weren't so overused/overbearing and obviously used to (failingly) disguise the fact that not much is going on.  Started out with promise in episode one but the elevator got stuck on this one.  If you're looking for something along the lines of The Thin Man, you'll be delighted in the two main characters but sorely disappointed in the mystery department.  I love leisurely paced British mysteries and sci-fi shows from the 60s-80s, but this one really sat still.  Definitely not a show to binge watch (maybe it worked better as a weekly mini-series as it originally aired), this one had me not only waiting for the whole season to pick up but for each episode to to turn the gears to no avail.  I was clenching my teeth and fists during the last 5 minutes of some episodes as they dragged on and on with nothing exciting or dynamic happening.  Dynamics, that's what was missing.  Flat line pacing.  There's no way I can even think of sharing this one with my family or friends as I can already hear the snores and queries of, ""Is it over yet?""  Shame since the cast, characters, banter, and settings are utterly charming.  Unfortunately, the parts are much more interesting than the whole (one 3 minute football/soccer match that came out of the blue was the highlight of the entire series!).  Since the characters were so watchable, even if the execution of non-plot was not, I'll go it alone and give the second series a shot.  If they had an actual mystery (this first one was more small town soap opera light comedy with VERY LIGHT mystery/whodunit) and picked up the pacing with some up/down movement (which would be more in line with the jazz score) this series could turn itself around with ease.  As is, series/season one, The Beiderbecke Affair, is an affair nobody needs to rush out to buy.  All you need to know is that a male teacher and a female teacher are dating and are easily intrigued by things that happen around them.  That's enough to let you start with the second season and hope it's got better mystery and storyline elements.  Then if you like that one, move on to season three.  Then and only then, would I recommend going back in time and seeing where it all began here in season one.  Unless you go in expecting a VERY leisurely paced ""days in the life of school teachers"" and VERY light ""almost a soap/almost a romantic comedy/almost slapstick/almost mystery"" quirky but cricket chirpy series that's like owning a vinyl record without owning a record player.  If you understand beforehand that the characters and occasional clever dialog are where the merit lies, and if it's enough for you to have that without an engaging move forward plot, then maybe you will enjoy this better than I, and many others who reviewed it, did.  It really is a solid example of a parsley only plate peppered with characters/actors that deserve much more story to work with.  A generous 3/5 stars since I can't give it a 2.5 here which is what it really deserves IMHO.",1475712000,,3217,4.63668430335097

Jill Swinburne, who teaches at the same school in Yorkshire, is an assertive activist out to change the world; or at least some of it.
They are friends as well as lovers who, almost by accident, get involved in investigating some shady dealings by local government.
""The Beiderbecke Affair"" takes its name from the fact that Trevor (played by the brilliant James Bolam) is a jazz fan, and especially a fan of the late, great Bix Beiderbecke. He orders a set of Beiderbecke LPs from a door-to-door saleswoman and is distressed when the wrong records arrive on his doorstep. In trying to get the right records, he and Jill (played by the delectable Barbara Flynn) get drawn into the slightly seedy world of gray market goods. Harassed by an over-zealous local cop, rubbing shoulders with a variety of interesting - if not completely honest - folks, and dealing with the reappearance of Trevor's former fiancee, who dumped him because he was ""boring"" just before they were to be married, Trevor and Jill try to figure out just what is going on.
Some reviewers have compared ""The Beiderbecke Affair"" to the screwball mystery/comedies of the Thirties and Forties but I can't agree. Instead, this is a gentle story that does not gallop so much as stroll. Trevor and Jill are not Nick and Nora Charles, the high-living protagonists of ""The Thin Man"" movies. They don't party all night and their banter, while witty, is not sharp-edged. They are appealing characters in their own right.
The music that is a constant throughout this six-episode series, is almost a character in itself. Scored by Frank Ricotti, it sets the mood of each scene and is wonderful.
The pace of the series is, as I've mentioned, slow. This gives the actors time to develop their characters and for the viewer to appreciate a lot of little nuances that might be missed if this series was more madcap. It also gives the actors time to voice some sharp observations about the often-too-cozy relationship between government and big business and the lack of support for schools.
The pace didn't trouble me but I recognize that it might be difficult for some viewers, who are more used to the fast scene cutting that is characteristic of more modern films and television programs, to enjoy. There are no high-speed chases, no shootouts, and the only real violence is a shoving match between two soccer coaches. Again, I recognize that the lack of blood, guts, and gore might not be a plus for viewers used to watching current mystery programs.
However, if you enjoy a nicely written, albeit gentle, story with appealing protagonists then I think you'll enjoy this tidy little mystery.

Trevor and Jill then set off to find the missing Beiderbecke records, leading to a series of strange encounters. The real strength of Alan Plater's writing is his creation of memorable characters, and the show's mystery really plays second fiddle to the interplay among the characters. The leads, Trevor and Barbara, have a low-keyed but charming chemistry. Throw in such goofy folks as Big Al, Little Norm, and a dozen more, and you have a multi-course meal of oddball Yorkshire characters to keep you watching for hours. Be warned, however, these programs were made in the 1980s, so may come across as dated to some. I think they wear quite well.",1422489600,,1013,5.035714285714286

7961297,2,B000065U2F,"Yes, I am a fan of James Bollum but largely who he has become, for example his role in the New Tricks series. This is early stuff and he plays a kind of dorky character second fiddle to a liberal brit woman politician. Her role is overdone and the product is a very average series.",1377302400,,281,4.127272727272727
7961298,5,B000065U2F,"This may be a very old series, but it is very funny. The script is particularly clever, the relationships really interesting and the storyline keeps you wanting more.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  I've just ordered the other two series.",1377129600,,230,5.1891891891891895
