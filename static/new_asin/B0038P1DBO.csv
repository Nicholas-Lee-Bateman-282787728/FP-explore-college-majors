8391610,2,B0038P1DBO,"This was a very dull movie about five kids who have to deal with various issues, like divorce, the death of a parent, and parents being constantly absent. They go around saying deep psychological things that kids would never say, and the story takes place in their suburban neighborhood and in the fields around the house, so visually, it's nothing exciting.

There IS some drama in the movie when you get these black-and-white clips of a guy with a sword and a cape running through fields and forest, and this is always followed by an attack on the five kids by a ""Dark Spirit,"" which causes one of the girls to have an asthma attack, and some of the kids have to fight it off with shining yellow swords. That is the extent of drama in the film, and it is very good, but there is only a little of it. Otherwise, the acting is not too good, and the movie is very bad. I was hoping there would be more fantasy in it, which is what the cover of the DVD made it look like there would be.",1358467200,,984,4.2063492063492065
8391611,4,B0038P1DBO,"I didn't know what to expect from this film and I have to look at it from a production standpoint and a content standpoint.  This film deals with loss and divorce and how it affects the children involved.  It plays out as a fantasy type movie and I think the director didn't want the message lost in special effects bells and whistles which, for me, took away from the overall story.  The subject matter was also approached from a more existential point of view and some of the dialogue was far too complex to come from the mouths and minds of 10-12 year olds.  I watched this with my grandchildren who are dealing with the separation of their own parents and it's their reaction that makes me recommend this movie.  This movie was effective in the sense that it caused my grandchildren to question and addres their own situation and the conversation we had after the movie was touching, deep and a direct result of this film. For that, I am glad that I rented this obscure movie because it made my grandchildren think and question and it seems to have given them a better understanding of their own situation.  This movie is definitely not for everyone and in these days of high tech effects and violence it will not hold the attention of most children.  But it will definitely touch the hearts of a few.",1304899200,,1305,4.504237288135593
8391612,5,B0038P1DBO,"The Five is about two sets of kids - neighbors in both landscape and loss - will wake one morning to find that their paths begin to resemble that of a character in their favorite mythological book series. What they don't yet know is that an invisible darkness following them is what they make it out to be - themselves, their fears about their parents, the frequency of change in their lives, and the instability of a world lived on the mountain's edge.

The Five is ultimately about friendship and living in the present moment.  Finally, a movie the entire family can enjoy together!",1276041600,2,584,4.605769230769231
