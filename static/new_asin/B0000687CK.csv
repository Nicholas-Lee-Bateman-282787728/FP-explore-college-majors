7963670,5,B0000687CK,"I don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from! I received my DVD today was really skeptical after reading all of the bad ones. WOW! For using the original film, AND it being from 1963, my husband and I both agree that both movies are BEAUTIFUL!I  We are very pleased. We even got it a little sooner than expected, so that's a double KUDOS!",1427500800,,353,4.348484848484849
7963671,5,B0000687CK,"What can I say?  I love anything Lassie.  This is a great movie combo.  The quality is fantastic, the story lines are very entertaining.  Now if I could just get my own collie to do some of those tricks...  I've ordered every single Lassie DVD Amazon has to offer.  I just wish they had more of them.",1404950400,,300,4.175438596491228
7963672,3,B0000687CK,"The story line of ""Lassies Great Adventure"" comes from a series of the tv show. The story is a typical Lassie episode with Timmy again in danger and Lassie coming to his aid. But this time they are trapped in a Hot Air Balloon thousands of feet above the ground drifting helplessly. While I enjoyed the movie this dvd I purchased has very muted colors, not vibrant like I had hoped and had to turn up my color intensity on my tv up to get it to look more colorful.",1351468800,,464,4.166666666666667
7963673,2,B0000687CK,"The quality/clarity of both videos is poor.  Although viewable, the picture is fuzzy and not clear.  Again, you can see and follow the story.  It's just very poor quality viewing.

The second movie is a collie, but the name is Shep and is not ""LASSIE"".",1302480000,,252,4.533333333333333
