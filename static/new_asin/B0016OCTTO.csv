i really enjoy extreme catch. and ice road truckers. ax men is a bit too slow for me.",1286841600,,266,3.8545454545454545

It was delivered before the date stated, so that was great.
He loved watching.",1268179200,,118,4.409090909090909
3161919,5,B0016OCTTO,"Bought as a gift; great price and in excellent condition, exactly as described. Received quickly!",1267574400,,97,5.533333333333333
3161920,4,B0016OCTTO,Excellent production but a bit dramatic. Production a bit jumpy but still very interesting and captures the beauty of the woods with all the problems of trying to make a living working there.,1258070400,,191,4.818181818181818
3161921,5,B0016OCTTO,"Let me put it this way - my wife has been asking me if she can watch it!! The show is great, as are the DVDs.  Beyond the cool machines and the near death experiences, this awesome testosterone fest manages to draw the viewers into the lives of the people in the stories.  By the end of the series it is hard not to feel connected with them.  Whether or not you are familiar with the industry, you will definitely be entertained by the ""colorful"" cast. If you are a lumberjack you'll swear you've worked with these guys, or you have worked with someone just like them. If you are not familiar with logging, this is a great introduction. It doesn't get over-technical. You will come away with an appreciation of process as well as the people involved.",1229385600,12,750,4.420289855072464

8263586,5,B0016OCTTO,"This 4-disk set follows several logging companies working in northwestern Oregon. There are 14 episodes plus a bonus feature. The loggers are tough, profane folks, so there's a lot of bleeped out dialog. But their day to day operations and methods are very interesting. And dangerous. The possibility of losing hands, arms, legs or your life is high. It's interesting, informative, and entertaining. I really enjoyed it.",1306281600,2,420,5.2835820895522385
