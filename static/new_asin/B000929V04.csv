2260792,2,B000929V04,I ordered Guns of Honor and everything says that(the box the DVD & the paperwork) but the DVD is Trigger Fast movie (the second one of two movies made for TV(about A feisty woman struggles to keep her ranch from being stolen by a greedy and unscrupulous land-baron))So I was upset that I did not get the one I payed for. It was still OK for a made for TV western.,1244764800,,363,4.126760563380282

It's the wrong movie than is described in the description and the back of the case. I bought this movie and it is the same as Trigger Fast, another JT Edson book, that stars Dusty Fog.",1235260800,3,327,6.809523809523809
2260794,3,B000929V04,"As an action western, it had enough twists to keep my attention. The ""good guy"" characters were likeable and the villains were despictable.

What made it interesting were the  border characters.

As for the plot, the dvd case states its about running guns to the Mexican gov't thru the French. WHAT movie were they watching? It's about a land hungry rancher using ""troopers"" to drive out all the small Southern ranchers by saying they need to pay their back taxes or else. Of course, our heroes arrive. This is a totally enjoyable western.",1181088000,2,539,4.774193548387097
2260795,1,B000929V04,"This mess is the remainder from a cobbled miniseries of which most, thankfully, has been left in the can, as is apparent by the billing: Jurgen Prochnow (1st) has a half-dozen or so short lines and nearly no screen time, Martin Sheen (2nd) disappears completely early on, Corbin Bernsen (3rd) does not appear at all. The screenplay is based upon the novel ""The Ysabel Kid"" by a popular English novelist writing as J. T. Edson (whose historically inaccurate depictions of Western Americana were researched for the most part in his favourite pub), and is replete with incongruity of dialogue, often lapsing into late 20th century American urban slang, only one element that is in the molding of this grotesque item. After studying its first half, a viewer will feel completely befogged after the plentiful activity involving frantic gunplay, fist fighting, rape, illy-advised nudity, and gore galore, since there are few, if any, clues given as to what may be transpiring, eased but mildly by an action halting soliloquy delivered by the female lead that tugs from the proceedings some vague concept of the story's direction. The plot engages a group of Confederate soldiers, shortly after the end of the War Between The States, that is attempting to smuggle new Winchester rifles, bestowed by the United States government upon Mexican rebels warring against Emperor Maximilian's French troops, and additionally involves another set of ex-Confederates that is bent upon delivering documents of amnesty from Washington to the other Southerners so that all may return to the reunited Union and prepare to wage war with French invaders into Texas (a fantasy of novelist Edson). This is one of those films wherein every scene provides something to laugh at, groan over, or pity since even a script doctor might do little for a work that demands hospitalization, suffering from such maladies as erratic sound mixing, ragged stunt work, commercial fadeouts arranged for its television release, fragmented storylines, an energetic rescue from drowning in a turgid waist deep river, frequent silly twirling of pistols and inefficiently fanning of their hammers during gun battles, shifts in relationships without ostensible cause, an intense young Indian (Todd Jensen) swearing totemic reprisal for the murder of his father (quaint casting here with Jensen having the same degree of believability as a vengeful Indian as would Tab Hunter), foolish historic implausibilities, and a slew of other factors that insult the Western film genre.",1168732800,7,2528,5.2754342431761785
8056775,5,B000929V04,"Okay, so the title card on the DVD menu says Guns of Honor and the main credits say Guns of Honor, but yes, the movie is actually Trigger Fast, which is the sequel to Guns of Honor. Im cool with it because I wanted DVD copies of both films anyway, so Ill take what I can get. I gave it five stars because I love the cast - Martin Sheen and Gerard Christopher especially - and its an easy to watch western. If you are a fan of the films, its worth the purchase.",1524528000,,460,3.904255319148936

8056777,3,B000929V04,"I thought that I was getting a story set in Mexico with a southern spy etc, but it turned out to be the story relating to Trigger Fast instead?
What happened to the the story about Mexican renegades & the French army?
Who do I contact regards purchasing the real DVD?
The one I got is a good story well paced the acting in the main was quite good, but as I said I would have liked the correct story to the film. At least I won't need to purchase Trigger Fast now.

8056778,1,B000929V04,The movie in the box is not the movie described on the back of the box and the movie I watched wasn't anything to brag about. I really makes you mad when you expect to see a movie and it's entirely a different movie.,1373328000,,216,3.9318181818181817
8056779,3,B000929V04,"Unfortunately, I can not rate the movie ""Guns of Honour"". The movie that I recivied was not ""Guns of Honour"". The Rating above is for the Movie ""Trigger Fast"".
The cover and All packaging Reads for the Guns of Honour movie, But the movie on the disk is Trigger Fast.  We went back through the credits and movie trailers on the internet, and found that they did not match up, or rather swaped movies.
(Both movies are from the same series of books, author, and actors, although they have two different story lines. Very confusing at first watching one movie when expecting another.)
Going by the movie we did watch, I don't feel that it did justice to the book or the book series on which it is based.

One day we might get to watch the movie that was ordered ""Guns of Honour"".

Postage and Packaging throgh Amazon was great and the movie arrrived on time, etc.
Unless they opened and watched amazon would not know about the switch of movies on the disk.
:( After reading the other review's it is very disappointing to realise that after all this time, years in fact, that the issue of getting the wrong movie on the disk has not been resolved. Wish I had read them first.",1324771200,2,1171,4.412037037037037
8056780,2,B000929V04,"Warning the DVD is Trigger Fast...NOT Guns of Honor.

These moves were a two part made for television mini-series very losely based on two novels by J.T. Edson (The Ysabel Kid and Trigger Fast).  The books are far better than the movie.

I suggest this movie only for those ignorant of JT Edson and his floating outfit characters (and love cheesy 'B' westerns) or those who are diehard Dusty Fog and Ysabel Kid fans.  The actors chosen for Dusty and Loncey are reasonable selections for their characters.  So if you want a chance to see them come to life it is worth suffering through the terrible and cheesy plots.  However, if you are a Mark Counter or Waco fan...run away and never watch these.  I depsise the actor chosen to play Mark Counter and how they drastically altered his character. Plus Waco is replaced with some Spanish character named Miguel.  This is a poor attempt to bring to film the Floating Outfit novels.  Hopefully someday a much better version will be attempted.",1304899200,,987,4.691860465116279
8056781,3,B000929V04,Purchased the GUNS OF HONOR: Sale went well and item received before due date which was good. PLEASE NOTE: this was a completely different movie to what is described on the cover which was disappointing.,1289001600,,203,4.828571428571428
8056782,1,B000929V04,"If I order product A, I'm not really expecting to receive product B.
First, that would be ""Trigger Fast"" not ""Guns Of Honor""
Second, that's very likely the worst screenplay ever made from a book I enjoyed. The book, not the movie ...",1286582400,,233,4.441860465116279
8056783,2,B000929V04,The movie on the DVD is not the one described on the back of the box. The movie on the back of the box is the first of the two movies made about Dusty Fog and crew and the DVD shows the second. The movie is good but not what you are expecting to see. This happnens when you get the DVD from any source.,1268352000,,302,3.6615384615384614
8056784,3,B000929V04,"There was nothing special about this movie.  The acting was average, if a bit wooden.  Some scenes were poorly edited or unnecessary and only interupted the story.  The characters had the names from the books but were nothing like them.  Over all, this was a passable, but darn close to a waste of  time.",1251331200,,304,4.555555555555555
