7883086,3,6305120730,"The quality of video production is low to fair at best.  But the material is essential and is covered fairly well.  It would be beneficial to any Police or Security who must respond to calls involving building searches or  clearings for alarms, etc.  For the price it should be an addition to  anyones Law Enforcement library.  For training, you can never have enough  material on hand.  I would reccomend this video to anyone who needs to  learn or augment a training program.",941587200,5,477,4.719512195121951
