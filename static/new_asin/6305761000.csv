7894832,3,6305761000,"These are some comments addressed to customers who own a wide screen flat panel, and it deals strictly with the Korean Import version. The print is slightly fuzzy and on the inky side which was typical of b&w film processing of the day. The problem here is the 2:35 transfer onto a 4:3 ""square"" NTSC format. On a flat wide screen panel you get a slit of an image in the center of the screen with all this black area surounding it. This is great for the subtitles since they have been placed under the bottom perimeter of the image so they sit on the black surrounding area and are tack-sharp, but it makes viewing the movie a real pain (unless you sit 2 feet away from the screen). The director uses the Dyaliscope shape to great advantage, but long shots lose their impact since people and objects are rendered so remote. If you zoom the picture in, you get a fuzzier image, but you at least get to see what's going on, particularly during the climactic robbery sequence, but then you completely lose the subtitles since they dissapear ""below"" the TV's bottom frame.

The film itself is a first rate robbery caper that will delight those who love ""Rififi,"" ""Topkapi"" and ""League Of Gentlemen."" So, because of the lousy non-anamorphic transfer I give this DVD only 3 stars. A pity.",1394668800,,1281,4.545454545454546

7894834,5,6305761000,"For those who enjoy the Jean Gabin - Alain Delon team, this show is a must.  Shot on location in Cannes in the early 60s, this black and white film takes you back to the best show France could lay on.  The sparkling Riviera in all its glory serves as a visual historical record of the period.  This film was an effort to impress; to depict the new/modern France of the 60's.  Enter into this new Riviera the great pair of French crime-show actors teamed up in a tantalizing, tight and fast running plot that is not only plausible but impressive (the two intend to make off with the entire summer season's winnings of a casino).  The filming on local in a modern, functioning casino on the Riviera makes the theme, plot and premise for the film all the more authentic.  The English subtitles go by fast and the translation, regardless of how well done, looses something but that's ok.  For the novice French speaker, there is much to be learned from the rapid lines Gabin and Delon spin off in the French gangster argot and slang of the day.  For native French speakers, it has to be great fun.  The Jean Gabin 'presence' is vintage and Delon sizzles in youthful beauty, confidence and insolence.  When his role switches to that of a ruthless tough, he is convincing; a side to the role that he switches on and off at ease.  He's otherwise a humorous lout.  Gabin's performance is stolid and hammers his colleagues and audience alike with deadly, matter-of-factness (don't mess with this guy...).  The mix of an audacious plot, humor and weighty irony at the films conclusion all intoxicate.  And we're all invited to be part of it on this unusual visit the Riviera.  A delightful film.",1351123200,9,1685,4.588628762541806
7894835,5,6305761000,"Verneuil was a gifted french director and obviously he couldn't escape from the New Wave influence. Sooner or later he should make a film who woul express that sense of hopeless and disturbing underground bits of fate.
In this bitter movie about two enchanting thieves Delon and Gabin ; they have a smart plan : to steal a casino in the famous blue coast.
Everything seems under control but!
The smart script carries us to an unexpected and bitter ending.
Gabin as always stating why he was the greatest and most complete french actor in the XX century.
Fine script and dialogues.
A must in your collection!",1087776000,3,607,4.682242990654205
7894836,3,6305761000,"I have to agree about the disappointing quality of this Image DVD.  Not only has Image used a mediocre print to make the transfer, they've also used an edited version of the film.  It originally ran 118 min., not the 103 that this print runs.  Another video company came out with a nice letterboxed vhs of this film a few years back (under its alternate title ""The Big Grab""), and they had the smarts to use the full-length version.  Too bad Image couldn't do the same... especially since there's some pretty nice stuff to see in those missing 15 minutes.  (BTW, like some other foreign films on DVD, this one seems just a bit speeded up or time-condensed, which probably means it was a PAL to NSTC transfer.)",1023235200,20,709,4.5078125
