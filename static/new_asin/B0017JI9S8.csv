8266241,3,B0017JI9S8,"A real confidence-builder for the beginning violin student, and includes adequate instruction on music theory for the beginner.  Also demonstrates a consistent and methodical style of learning a new piece of music and encourages proper form and technique from the very start.  Personally, I need a beginner's series that emphasizes the mechanics of playing the violin as well as maintenance and care for the instrument, including do's and don't's for proper bow technique, fingering, posture, etc.  Compared to the Violin Stars DVD series, I feel that Mrs. Seidel's series is a bit overpriced for the amount and variety of information obtained.  Still, it is a valuable and useful investment of time and money when compared to taking private lessons.",1396915200,,750,5.277310924369748
8266242,4,B0017JI9S8,"I'm new to the violin except for a 4 month stint 34 years ago.  My son joined the strings group at school (violin) and so I broke out my very old used violin.  Back when I first tried playing the Fiddle, I learned 1 song from a record/book package (no DVDs then).  I purchased some live instructor group lessons. The biggest drawback of taking lessons (other than cost) is that once I left each class, I did not remember very much, nor did I have a recording to fall back upon to hear the tune.  Not being musically inclined, I found it very difficult to progress in the class and quit once my prepaid lessons had finished.  I learned one song quite well from the record and book (no DVDs then), but did not learn a single song in the lessons.  The record and book cost less than a single lesson.

So now I am back on the violin.  I purchased this AMP package due to the high ratings and guarantee. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this $99 set, and I've only one $14.95 book and CD to compare it to.  I expressed my disappointment and requested a refund.  Mrs. Seidel responded the next day via Email and issued a credit to Amazon for my account.  THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.  I cannot give the product 5 stars, since I returned the package.  I can readily give it 4 stars for the manner in which Mrs. Seidel handled this situation.  It was  nice getting a friendly encouraging response from her even though I was requesting a refund.  She is a real trooper.  Obviously, those who rated it 5 stars found it quite worthwhile.",1349913600,,1527,4.339222614840989

8266244,5,B0017JI9S8,"I have had kinda bad luck with self teaching and using books or dvds and this is the best I have found except for a few on YouTube.  I can't afford a teacher so though the price is a low point the quality I found was great.  The only thing bad about not having a teacher is to have correction so when you are doing something wrong constantly you might not find out until a lot later and by that time its a hard habit to break.  I found the songs were very easy to follow step by step.  The only thing I wish it had was more practice tips like how long to practice certain things and for how long you should.  I never felt like I was lost and I could see my talent go from nothing to slowly starting to build.  I am looking forward to more these kinds of lessons later.

A quick note about the quality of the video is kinda like what you would have if you used a nice camcorder and the audio when I would watch on my computer the subwoofer would pick up I think it was vehicle sounds outside of the building she was in.  These are minor things and didn't take anything away from the overall experience and I would highly recommend these lessons for any beginners.",1227312000,7,1162,4.065789473684211
8266245,5,B0017JI9S8,"Trust me, if you want to learn violin, get this DVD series!
To be honest, I had my doubts, because I spent time and money on useless books and DVDs (like ABC's of violin) and learned nothing. But after I researched Mrs. Seidel violin teaching methods and visited her website, videoviolinlessons.com (check it out, it's great!), I felt comfortable enough to try her DVD series. I noticed the difference right away, because I was able to e-mail Mrs. Seidel on all of my questions,..and she actually e-mailed me back with a real answer (amazing this day and age), and the DVD lessons are extremely helpful, with well organized DVD menus, crystal clear picture and sound, two different camera angles side by side (full image, and close up of the fingering hand) and the music on screen at the same time! No more, looking back and forth from fumbling with the sheet music and trying to follow the DVD, the way Mrs. Seidel professionally arranged the on screen lessons is BRILLANT! I for one am a true believer in learning violin from a DVD series, and I definitely will purchase the other DVD series.",1207612800,21,1095,4.678756476683938
