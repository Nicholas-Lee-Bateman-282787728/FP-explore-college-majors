65034,5,0783210973,"This movie kept me in stitches from beginning to end!  The first time I saw Colin Friels in a movie role, but he was just too funny, as was all the other stars!  Check out Colin Friels dressed up as Santa, what a hoot! If you love to laugh, you've got to watch this movie!",1390262400,,272,3.9272727272727272
65035,2,0783210973,"This movie is without blood and without the satirical bite that I had hoped for. A number of good ideas are introduced, but none developed, most salient of which is the character portrayed by Sean Connery. There is way, way too little of him in this movie and way, way too much of John Lithgow's ultra-lame British Accent. The protagonist is a dud too. I was hoping for something on the order of Evelyn Waugh, or at least White Mischief. Instead I got something about as adroit as a Meryl Streep stand-up. This movie just sort of lays there for a while (too long a while) and then just dies.",1389830400,,591,4.381818181818182

65037,4,0783210973,"This film is surprisingly true to the book - although it is synopsis rather than a complete dramatisation.
Sean Connery is very well cast as the doctor - the other main characters are more glamorous than in William Boyd's book.
As the screen play is by William Boyd this is probably why it does work well as a film.",1298678400,,315,4.3559322033898304
65038,5,0783210973,"I'm so glad this finally became available on DVD in North America.  My wife and I absolutely love this film.  It has an excellent cast, great plot, perfect comedic timing.  The acting is superb, the writing terrific, the great lines... ""Innocence is dead!"", ""Don't touch it!"", ""G'evening Dutchess"".  It's sooo funny, to me it's right up there with ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", for gut wrenching laughs.  I have no idea why it got bad reviews.  I never read the book, maybe that's part of it.  If you haven't read the book get this movie.",1272412800,2,542,4.702127659574468
65039,5,0783210973,"This was a great film to watch. The acting was excellent all the way through the film. Diana Rigg and Sean Connery in the same film is a can't miss and Colin Friels was their equal, every performance from all the actors was just fantastic. I wish this was on DVD.",1221523200,4,263,4.176470588235294

Forget watching this dud & read the book instead !",1205884800,,114,4.2272727272727275
65041,4,0783210973,"This is a very funnny film that needs to be on DVD immediately if not sooner. The one liners from Colin Friels, John Lithgow and Sean Connery really make the movie.  Most people, including myself, no longer have VCRs so get it on DVD now!",1145145600,2,238,4.288888888888889
65042,5,0783210973,A Good Man in Africa is a really great film and totally deserves to be released on DVD.  If you get the chance to enjoy this movie do not pass it up.,1141344000,3,149,3.65625
65043,1,0783210973,"The plot falls apart everywhere.  The dialogue is run-down babbling.  The only good thing about this movie is the spectacular African scenery and better than average cinematography.  I was so disappointed to see Sean  Connery (my favorite actor of all) wasting his talents on this unwatchable  film -- or, I should say, the script he's been given is an affront to his  talent.  Try MEDICINE MAN, instead.  It has the same great scenery, and a  much more enjoyable Sean Connery.",955929600,6,477,4.8625

7790535,3,0783210973,everything is fine with the product except that the description listed the title as wide screen and it was not. it was formatted 4:3. and the widescreen version was the reason i was ordering this as i already owned the 4:3 version. so be careful that you get what you really want.,1453852800,,280,4.403846153846154

7790537,2,0783210973,"Not nearly so vivid nor humorous as the book, but still a decent representation.  One misses most of the internal dialog of Leafy that is so central to the character in the book.",1430697600,,178,4.393939393939394
7790538,1,0783210973,"I don't remember ordering this item. From the reviews, it should be rated R for sexual exploitation, which sounds like a major theme.",1424217600,,133,4.826086956521739
7790539,5,0783210973,"This comedy is uproariously funny, although I confess you might need to have some awareness of things English to fully appreciate it. The plot derives much of its humor from the collision of cultures (English and mythical/generic African nation), while still having attitudes and situations that are widespread.  It is Sean Connery as you likely have never seen him, not at all 007 action hero, rather more genteel acerbic English.
  As the plot unwinds through a tumultuous election in the African nation, it takes a serious twist and makes one think about how twisted politics and politicians can be.  As an undercurrent, banter about a wide variety of subjects, from interracial sex to knighthood and just plain getting ahead, keep one engaged and laughing.  Highly recommended.",1411257600,,781,5.166666666666667
7790540,4,0783210973,"The movie version of ""A Good Man in Africa"" isn't bad, but the book version is better.  First of all, by buying and reading the book, you will get the benefit of William Boyd's artistry with words, which is considerable.  (You may even acquire a taste for his fiction, which can be satisfied by reading his many other fine novels and his short story collection.)  Another advantage you'll gain by reading the book is access to the full story--plot, setting, and character development--which necessarily is somewhat curtailed in the movie version.  Nevertheless, I do want to recommend the latter as an excellent comic film, with a cast of characters that includes some big names-- Sean Connery, Diana Rigg, Lou Gossett, Jr., and John Lithgow--and a less well-known one (at least to me), Colin Friels, who plays the hapless  'hero' of the story, Morgan Leafy.  The plot is fast-paced and pits British greed (for oil rights) against African guile and political ambition in the person of Professor Sam Adekunle (Lou Gossett, Jr.).  Morgan Leafy, who is employed by the British High Commission (i.e., embassy), finds himself in the role of go-between and thus on the receiving end of equally impossible orders from his ambassador (John Lithgow) and Professor Adekunle.  Meanwhile Morgan manages to get sexually involved with a wide social spectrum of women:  his local (Black) girlfriend, Hazel; the ambassador's daughter, Priscilla; Adekunle's wife, Celia; and (nearly) even the ambassador's wife, Chloe (Diana Rigg).  Hovering over Morgan throughout his trials--which include a venereal dose and an episode of body snatching--is Dr. Alex Murray (Sean Connery), a good man in Africa and a sort of strict parent stand-in and moral guide to the much-in-need-of-same Morgan Leafy.  Altogether, a very entertaining film.  Enjoy!",1402358400,2,1821,5.241379310344827

7790542,3,0783210973,"Not bad, got it after reading the book. Book is superb, hilarious, and I have to say that the movie version is an intelligent edit on the book, Movie characters for me match up to my imagined book images. Worth viewing. Buy the book.",1392508800,,233,4.318181818181818
