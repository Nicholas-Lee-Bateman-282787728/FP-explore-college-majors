8312169,2,B0007Y5HQQ,"Not what I expected. The film quality was not good & it was a random array of dances, not just Iranian.",1357948800,,103,3.9523809523809526
8312170,5,B0007Y5HQQ,"There is a huge variety of performances- from traditional Persian dances to modern Iranian, Arabic and American styles (well, if the 80s are modern). He's funny, and no, it's not the most perfect dvd in the world, but I love the variety and the music choices and the easy moves to steal for my own dancing... lively, upbeat, and a glance into a country that is mysterious from over here. The classic 'hat' dance from Iran, lots of frame drum dance, nice skirt moves, a wedding dance, costumes from possibly the 1800s forward. A hilarious faux pharonic at the end to a I like to Move It Move It medley that got the kids up dancing too!",1222214400,,634,4.427350427350428
8312171,3,B0007Y5HQQ,The prior reveiwer who talked about the workout is confusing this performance DVD with another DVD set by the same choreographer called Persian Dances. I believe it is now out of print but possibly can be found on the caltex website.,1173398400,,233,4.7073170731707314
8312172,2,B0007Y5HQQ,"The previous review led me to believe that this was a dance workout dvd.  It is NOT.  It's a series of performances cut from an Iranian television show.  Some of the routines have a folk dance flair to them, some more belly dance-like, and one performance attempts an American flair.  It was the first time I'd seen a male belly dancer - complete with beaded fringe belt and fringed shirt.  For the most part, the performances are on the level of the old variety shows - just entertainment.  I kept expecting Ed Sullivan or Lawrence Welk to walk out.  At this price, I took a chance - I gave it two stars because I was interested in the costumes.",1159574400,5,646,4.378151260504202
8312173,5,B0007Y5HQQ,"My mom bought me this DVD and I was ready to mock and laugh at it. It really surprised me.  Although the warm up is fast and not too safe, if you are familiar with yoga or stretching, you can modify it to fit your needs.

The rest is fun, he shows you great dance moves and he really gets you sweating. I love this DVD and enjoy working out with it everytime.",1112572800,8,359,3.904109589041096
