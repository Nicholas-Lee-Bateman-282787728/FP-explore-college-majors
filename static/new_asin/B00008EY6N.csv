1841027,4,B00008EY6N,I dug this show more so from when it first came on as to later years.it was a interesting way of telling the Force's story.the cast had good chemistry&this show worked really well for It's time period.,1076198400,,201,4.45945945945946
1841028,5,B00008EY6N,"This is one of my all-time favourite shows, one that I've been waiting for years for Sony / Columbia Tri-star to release (along with Newsradio).
Compared to some of the later Barney Miller seasons this probably isn't worth the full 5 stars, but it certainly deserves 5 starts compared to the zillions of average TV shows around, past or present.
I agree with the earlier review that mentioned that the picture quality isn't top-notch, but then it is almost thirty years since the original broadcasts and the quality is good enough that I forgot to worry about it within the first five minutes of the first episode. It's as good as other 70s television DVDs.
I don't mind the lack of bonus extras - as long the episodes are there I'm happy, though I miss not having ""The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller"" mentioned in the other review.
Can't wait for the other seasons to be released, and well done to Sony for not coming out with a stupid 'best of' (which we all know would've picked the 'wrong' episodes). Full season releases are the only way to go.",1075766400,15,1058,4.544502617801047
1841029,5,B00008EY6N,"Thank you! Thank You! Thank You, Sony!  Don't stop here until you get every last episode out on DVD!  I don't care if you weren't even born when Barney Miller aired.  Get this DVD!!- Get them all!  You will love the show.  Barney Miller is truely unique and hillarious.  Please continue the series of DVD's!",1074816000,5,307,4.490909090909091
1841030,5,B00008EY6N,"I just got the DVD today, and it's really nice to see Barney Miller, free of network logos, annoying voice-overs and split-screen credits. Not to mention the fact that the picture quality is better than on TV.
As you may know, Barney Miller is a great sitcom. The actors are so natural in their roles, right from the start. The writing is clever, very human and thoroughly funny. It's testament to the great writing that a show that takes place essentailly in one room can be engaging week after week. The ethnically diverse cast was also pretty radical for the time. No wonder this show is considered a classic. My sugggestion is shell out the $25 or so and buy it. There is so much great humor (and humanity) in the first season alone that it's worth the price, and the later seasons just kept getting better.
My one compaint about the DVD is that I noticed the first episode is only about 23 minutes. I'm assuming this episode is edited, because the other episodes I've watched so far run 25 minutes. Or maybe it originally ran this way?
I am really enjoying the DVD, and I'm Glad Columbia/TriStar did the right thing by releasing a well-produced season set of this landmark show. Its good to see the guys at the old one-two back on the beat.",1074556800,8,1245,4.488986784140969
1841031,5,B00008EY6N,"About bloody time!!  THis one of one the best comedies, but it was so much more.  It was caring, it was quirky, it was bloody brilliant.  Hal Linden starred as Capt Barney Miller of NYC Manhattan South detective squad, a mix of ethnic backgrounds - there is the much loved and totally deadpan Jack Soo as Det. Nick Yemana, Max Gail as Det. Stan 'Wojo' Wojciehowicz,Abe Vigoda  Det. Phil Fish, Ron Glass as Det. Ron Harris, Gregory Sierra as  Det. Sgt. Chano Amenguale with a great support cast and wonderful guest work.
It was filmed in videotape giving it a closer more accessible feel.  The building was old and falling down around their ears, Yemana made the worst coffee, and often their bosses were causing them more problems that helping the squad, but the stalwart detectives handle missing persons, bank robberies, con men, prostitutes and werewolves with equal aplomb and a heavy dash of wit.
It is sharply written, with a heart lacking in a lot of telly.
Just does not get any better than this!",1074038400,8,1004,4.676136363636363
1841032,5,B00008EY6N,"Barney Miller deserves to be mentioned right up there with shows like MASH, Mary Tyler Moore, and All in the Family, as one of the great comedies of the 1970's.
This cop show, taking place almost exclusively in the cramped squad room, was made up of a relatively unknown cast.  The casting was Brilliant.  Not only the casting of the cops, but of many of the re-occuring roles such as the old school Inspector Luger, Bruno the sporting goods store owner, the gay couple (one of the earliest depictions of gay men on TV), and of course Fish's Wife Bernice.
The First season wasn't the strongest.  Too much time spent at home and with Barneys wife.  The show would really hit it's stride when Steve landesberg would replace Gregory Sierra in the cast as Det. Arthur Dietrich.
Still, even these first handlful of episodes gives you an early glimpse at how good this show would be very soon.  i only wish it was on more often in re-runs.  But hopefully all future seasons will be released on DVD.",1074038400,8,992,4.544943820224719
1841033,5,B00008EY6N,"Of all the TV series released to DVD thus far, this one has me the most excited.  Being born in 1975, the show was pretty much before my time but it remains as my favorite sitcom.  The show comes from a time in television where each character is unique and captivating.  So much so that the fact the whole series pretty much takes place on the same police headquarters set is never a problem.  When the show airs now on TV Land they are editted for time.  I for one am looking forward to the complete versions again and with luck all the seasons will be released like the M*A*S*H sets.  If you couldn't tell, this is a dream for me!",1073433600,9,632,4.181818181818182
1841034,5,B00008EY6N,"One of the top five cop/crime shows ever. Great cast. OK representation of New York City at the time.
Hopefully after this they'll release ""Joe Bash""!
Hey, I'm not kidding about ""Joe Bash""! That was a great show.
The last several years,  crime shows are all about the action and chases and gunshots. Barney Miller, Joe Bash and most of Hill Street Blues were great because there was mostly just talking going on.",1071532800,3,412,4.6438356164383565
1841035,5,B00008EY6N,"Wish someone had introduced this to me sooner. This is better than any cop-related show created before or since.

Albeit I've not seen all that much of his work. He part in The Godfather was small, but important, & just one of a zillion classic components of the film. Idk, but he cracked me up in 1989's Look Who's Talking. And the one & only time I went to a taping of ""Late Night w/ Conan O'brien"" back in April of 2002! They had this ongoing silly no-sense making inside joke w/ Abe, he'd just pop his headin the studio in the mid of taping, he happened to come do that when I was there. Good times.

Hogan's Heroes and the Odd Couple which were all smart witty comedies. This show is probably one of the best ever written and acted
and directed. I love that they made fun of everything and everybody without all the political correctness Hollyweird crap they make today!

Indirectly it paved the way for a number of other shows like Law and Order and NYPD Blue.  I have heard police officers say that it in many ways is the most accurate cop shows on TV.

The show is great to watch because as has been said many times it had both great writing and amazing acting. The humor is dry and sensible and requires you to pay attention to understand what is going on.  The warts and all portrayal of the 12th precinct is amazing with all its filth and broken down equipment. It is even funnier now to see how some of the clothing and dialogue has not stood up to the test of time. Lastly, I think that dropping Barney's family from the show was a very good idea as the focus was and should have been in the squad room.

When I was older, and would watch it in syndication, I began to see why it had been so popular.
The writing was witty and dry, occasionally bordering on slapstick. All the characters were great, and worked very well as a comedy team. Just seeing them now is sort of like seeing old friends.
Even the squad room set feels like a familiar place.
When I get to talking with girls around my age, and the subject of TV shows comes up, I mention that I love Barney Miller and often get the same response; ""Oh, my dad used to love that show...""

Season 1 is somewhat different from subsequent seasons; it has a couple of episodes that feature Barney Miller's family at home. This included Barbara Barrie as his wife & also featured two daughters. The home life got very little attention after the initial season.

Barney Miller was one of the first ensemble sitcoms. The cast of supporting characters were indeed an eclectic group; Chano, the Puerto Rican, Fish, the old cop, Wojo, the macho Pole, Harris, the Black with aspirations, & Yemana, the gambling Chinese. Most episodes were focused in the squad room that featured a zany collection of criminal & not-so-criminal types.

Gently ascerbic wit, astute observation, brilliant ensemble acting that will have you overworking the rewind button on your DVD player-- what more can one say? OK, a policeman's life in the raw this is not. It's not trying to be. But many of New York's finest (and probably of its not-so-fine) acclaimed the show for subtly getting across to the viewer the boredom and repetitiveness of much of police work; for representing the often comical stupidity of many criminals. We all know about the other, harsher side of a city policeman's reality, there is no dearth of programming for that.

I truly think it is one of the best sitcoms of all times, even with the rough start in Season 1.  Some of the episodes I haven't seen in over 25 years, yet I can still remember them today (Brownie and Werewolf episodes crack me up just thinking about them).

It is a shame that TV(waste)Land stopped airing this show.  It's more of a shame that we can't get all of the seasons on DVD.  I watched Season 2 straight through and am so mad that there are no more episodes released. Season 2 is 10 times better than Season 1 and I consider Season 1 to be very good.

1841483,4,B00008EY6N,"What you have here is the entire first season of one of America's most famous and well-liked television shows from the 70's--""Barney Miller"". All thirteen episodes are here--digitally remastered!!!!!

Looking at ""Barney Miller"" today,it's not hard to see why this show still acquires good respect. Set in the 12th precinct of the New York City police department,the episodes find the precinct's officers(Hal Linden's character of Captain Barney Miller,Abe Vigoda's character of Detective Phil Fish,Gregory Sierra's character of Detective Chano Amenguale,Max Gail's character of Detective Stan 'Wojo' Wojchiehowitz,and even though they weren't ""official cast members"" at the time,Ron Glass' and Jack Soo's characters of Detective Ron Harris and Detective Sergeant Nick Yemana)caught up in their own work and the chaos of their own personal lives(most notably Miller and Fish--that's when the humor really hits hard!). The remarkable thing about ""Barney Miller"" is how it never runs low on humor and how the show's actors execute the humor to the fullest--with a good serious edge also. The ""drama"" in some of the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" take on an appropriate amount of dominance with richly executed talent. It makes the episodes of ""Barney Miller"" that are to be found here very remarkable and worthwhile--keeping the entertainment coming.

As for the packaging of the first season of ""Barney Miller"",things here are in good hand. As already mentioned,all thirteen episodes are digitally remastered. On top of that,you get TV-ographies of the cast of the first season of ""Barney Miller""(with the exceptions of Barbara Barrie and Gregory Sierra),the theatrical trailer for ""Anger Management""(yes,the 2003 Adam Sandler/Jack Nicholson flick,even if this DVD was released a year after the release of ""Anger Management""),television trailers(one trailer for most old television shows from the era that ""Barney Miller"" was on that are now on DVD,the other trailer for both shows from that era and ""recent"" shows such as ""Mad About You"" and ""King of Queens"",both the shows and the DVDS of them getting equal representation),as well as two booklets(one with info on the episodes that are to be found on this DVD,and one that advertises the DVDS that the first disc of this set advertise). I find it dissapointing that the special feautures give no representation of ""Barney Miller"" and no recognition to either Barbara Barrie or Gregory Sierra(the same actor who played Julio Fuentes on ""Sanford and Son"" and Lt. Lou Rodriguez on ""Miami Vice"",I might add). However,with the special feautures having a memorable gem(who could ever forget ""Anger Management""??!!)and offering a good look at television(70's plus)in a nutshell,I can't complain too bad.

Overall,a good way for ""Barney Miller"" fans to enjoy the first season. Worth the time and the money.",1199577600,,2846,5.4198645598194135

The way Detrich and Harris play off each other is some of the funniest TV I've ever watched.  Episodes like the one where Harris finds he's of Scottish descent when searching for his Afro-American roots and the line where Detrich declares ""semantics are my life""  they just don't write many shows like that any more.  I'm not meaning to overlook the rest of the cast as they were all fantastic but Gregory Sierra as Chano just never quite fit with the rest of the cast and because of that much of the humor in the first season falls a little flat.

Interestingly, I bought a box of General Mills cereal that included a Barney Miller DVD, which had a couple of episodes of Barney Miller on it. This DVD was a way for Sony Pictures Television to advertise the Barney Miller DVD collection. However, these two episodes are not part of Season One. They are:

""The Tunnel"":  Season 4
""The Obituary"": Season 8

Sadly, if no further seasons of Barney Miller are released (probably due to low sales, revenue drives business), then this cereal DVD will become a collector's item. I now keep the cereal DVD in its own DVD case.

1841526,5,B00008EY6N,"For anyone who isn't familiar with Barney Miller, I reccomend you purchase your very own copy of the first season of this brilliant show, and acquainte yourself with its wit, intelligence and authenticity.  My only qualm is that this is the only season that has been released on DVD (they really need to transfer the rest of the seasons).  What sets Barney Miller apart from other sit coms/dramas I have seen on television, is its distinctive and intelligent approach to humor.  The characters are not only believeable and very down to earth, but really potentially loaded topics are handled in a very sensitive and insightful way.  You walk away feeling not only entertained, but more intelligent.  This is a timeless quality to the series that makes it just funny, now, as it was thirty years ago.

Captain Barney Miller (Hal Linden), head of the 12th Precinct in New York City, works and interacts with a range of characters (in and outside his office).  These characters include the hilarious and swarthy Sargaent Amenguale, crusty Det. Phil Fish (Abe Vigoda), child-like Det. Stanley ""Wojo"" Wojciehowicz (Max Gail), insightful Det. Nick Yemana (Jack Soo), poetic and outspoken Det. Ron Harris (Ron Glass) and lone female Det. Janice Wentworth (Lina Lavin).  Together, they make quite a team, abundant with classic one liners and insightful observations about the world.

Episodes run the gamet of just about every scenario you can imagine (everything from prostitution to mental illness to drug addiction).  The subject matter is handled sensitively and thoughtfully.  Capt. Miller is more of a social worker, than a cop, and we see his character as a strong, yet compassionate, man.  If you thought NYPD Blue gave you glimpse into the work of detective and police work in NYC, give Barney Miller a try.  You will be glad you did.......",1165968000,10,1841,5.016447368421052

The acting and the interaction of the original main characters is what sets this Sitcom apart from the rest.  The men of the one-two encounter serious situations that they are able to handle with their own inimitable style. They dispense justice with common sense, judgement, warmth and more than a little bit of humor.

The writers created truly unique unforgettable characters.

Barney Miller - The big hearted practical problem solver.  Barney would make a Great Police Commissioner or Big City Mayor.

Fish - A mischevious, wisened old detective awaiting retirement.

Yamana - The perpetual Gambler with a dry sense of humor.

Wojo - The over eager young detective that loves women and doesn't think too hard.

Harris - The dreamer that would rather be a novelist than a cop but needs a job to pay the bills until the big break comes along.

Even the eps after Chano(Gregory Sierra)left & before Steve Landesburg came aboard would be better than nothing. Even the ones with Leavitt(who started as a sewer-diving cat burglar, and was eventually rehabilitated enough to become a regular)are way better than nothing. It seems like any Fox or UPN P.O.S. series that is on for more than 12 eps gets a box set release, but those of us who aren't satisfied with a ""Pukes Of Hazzard"" Box Set(with lots of pictures & no big words)are outta luck.(Likewise with ""The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis""...where the heck is that, and ""Car 54, Where Are You?""??).

1841550,4,B00008EY6N,"Barney Miller will always be a favorite sitcom of mine. It was different, and had its own brand of humor, Its setting being Manhattan is very appropriate for the ethnic range of policemen. Like another reviewer stated, this 1st season is still discovering its characters and who they are about. That is why I give it only 4 stars. This season, along with the 2nd (the 2 should have been packaged together!) pretty much test out who would survive the 12 precinct, with several guest detectives popping up, then quickly disappearing, like Wilson in episode 2 and Lovatelli in season 2, as well as Linda Lavin as Wentworth in both seasons. Do not be fooled by the expermental nature of this seaosn, it is FUNNY. It is just that some of our favorites are not who we fondly remember yet...Wojo starts off as a muscleheaded doofus who hasn't been sensitized to the world around him yet, Harris starts off as more of a ""Hey baby!"" jive-talking detective who hasn't found his dry, witty voice yet (the last 4 years of the show are his best). Yemana and Fish are pretty constant throughout their runs. Chano is a cool character, and I was surprised he didn't last past 2 seasons. Maybe the occasional spurts of Spanish from him didn't test well with audiences.

  And then there is Barney himself. As the years went by, his words of wisdom and reason to his men and criminals alike were used by his men as well. He also forged good relationships with the men, especially Wojo. He is a trusted confidante of Fish and his many ailments. Inspector Luger seems to think Barney wants to hear his long tales about the past, but Barney just sits and listens patiently. Anyone who has seen the series knows it took a LOT to make Barney raise his voice in anger.

  This series lasted for 8 seasons.....and only 1 has been released! A lot of 1 season wonders are out there on the shelves, and lots of 1-2 season no-wonders are also there, usually recent failures. A great like this should not be ignored.",1152835200,19,1986,4.549019607843137

1841552,4,B00008EY6N,"If I'm correct, Barney Miller began as a mid-season replacement series so calling this a complete season is a little misleading. That said, this is still one of the best sitcoms ever. It's also one of the most underrated. In all its years on the air I doubt it ever recieved an Emmy, a few nominations here and there but never the big prizes in writing, acting or series categories. All of the members of ""the 'ol 1-2"" were certainly worthy of consideration. This first season introduces the primary characters of Capt. Miller, Dets. Fish, Yemana & Wojohowicz. Steve Landesberg's character of Detective Detrich came into the series later. It's hard to believe the same actor who complained about his ailments to his wife Bernice here would also be part of film immortality with the phrase ""Luca Abrazi sleeps with the fishes"". The writers here were probably still finding their way around the characters so we get the scenes between Barney and his wife Liz (which I think were a distraction and were phased out around the end of season 1). So what remains are the elements of a future classic. I really wish Sony would get the remaining seasons out, can't wait to see the famous ""brownie episode"" again as well as the case of Angelo Molinari a.k.a ""The Mole.

1841584,4,B00008EY6N,"I love Barney Miller. The show may have been canceled 10 months before I was born, but I've seen more than half of the series episodes, taped from TV Land for my own use, and I have grown to love the series.

In this Season One package, all 13 episodes of it, I discovered new characters (Det. Wilson) that had never really been mentioned later in the series. The plotlines were good, if not slightly less smooth, natural, and refined as the series and its players grew together, developed, and hit their strides in later seasons.

Jack Soo is hilarious as Nick Yemana. Barbara Barrie does a great job as the Captain's cheerful, emotional, yet hilarious wife. Gregory Sierra's Chano Amenguale and Hal Linden's Captain Miller make great social commentary. James Gregory's Inspector Luger came in occasionally and delivered heartily. Abe Vigoda's Phil Fish was his old broken-down, usual self. Ron Glass's Det. Harris and Max Gail's Wojo had yet to hit their characters dead-on, but still dod a good job. And Linda Lavin's one episode in this season probably makes it the best of the season. And it's all very clever, witty, and funny.

The series tackled issues of the realities of taking a life while on duty, homosexuality and society, the politics of the era, women's issues, marital issues, the tense politics and national temperament of the day and so forth, all on its small, comedic 30-minute 13-episode weekly canvas in early-mid 1975. Few shows dare to go deep and bring an intelligence and complexity to story line and humor anymore.

The Disc features are lacking in that they don't offer much except the episodes. Nothing extra beyond movie trailers.

But more than that, SONY needs to get the second season out on DVD. We can't just have the first season of this show and its meager 13 episodes. If they're releasing multiple seasons of Diff'rent Strokes, Gilmore Girls, and Curb Your Enthusiasm, they should release the remaining 7 seasons of this Emmy Award-winning show that ended up in the Top 20 (and even the top 15) in ratings, year-by-year, in its day.

The cast are top notch, it's gritty, usually contains some sort of serious undertone and is chock full of wacked out characters who pass through the precinct:  The gay shoplifter, the flasher, the drunken Congress man etc.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.

1841597,5,B00008EY6N,"I'll admit that I was not always the biggest fan of the first season of ""Barney Miller,"" particularly in comparison to subsequent season when the writing got better and the actors were more in tune with their characters.  But I bought the first Sean anyway so I would have a compete set of DVDs once the rest of the seasons were released.

Now, a year and a half later there seems to be no sigh of subsequent seasons being released.  I guess it is my fault, but I sort of feel like I've been given the old ""bait and switch"" and as such it is going to make me think twice before buying first season sets of other shows in the future.

I wish that Amazon would provide for us one of those pages where we can sign up for  DVDs that are not in production so that they can notify the studio on how many people are waiting.",1122422400,7,817,4.113207547169812

I was elated to see the reruns on TV Land after so many years (wish they were still on). I taped every one of them but would prefer to have all seasons on DVD. When Season 1 was released I thought for sure the other seasons would be released soon but to no avail. When I see some of the other sitcoms that have been released entirely it makes me angry to think that we only have Season 1 of Barney Miller. It is one of the best written and most enjoyable sitcoms ever on television and pure family entertainment. I introduced my 16 year old son to it when it was on TV Land and he also loves it.

1841602,5,B00008EY6N,"So this DVD set has been out for over a year. Since it's release we've seen 3 seaons of The Jefferons, 6 sets of Saved by the Bell, 6 of Sanford & Son and 5 of Three's Company. This is criminal!

In addition, over the last few years, there have been 5 seasons of Cheers & Fraizer (both good shows), 5 of All in the Family (a landmark) and another landmark, MASH is on season 8. No question on the deserved nature of these releases.

Most people probably wouldn't put Barney in landmark catagory. I would say it was a landmark in my life (as far as TV goes anyway). Was Barney Miller better than these shows. To most, no; To me yes. Barney Miller ran in conjunction with MASH and I looked forward to seeing it more than I did MASH. But 6 seasons of Sandford & Son? How about Battlestar Galactica? (the whole thing) the A-Team? (2nd season).

, but it's one of the best show ever on TV and it's still sitting on season one!

And the real crime is season one is when the cast and writers were just feeling their way with this show. It's not bad, but it's nowhere near the quality of season 3 thru 5.

I give it five stars for the whole series, but really this particular season is more like 3.5. I need more. Let's get a move on Columbia Tristar. Let's show people how good this show really was. Let's get past season 2 please! Don't let this  program die on the ash heap of failed DVD TV shows.

Green Acers? The Munsters?!?!? Good Times (4 seasons worth). Let's not confuse energy and loud on-liners for quality. Give me more Barney Miller.

The characters all mesh, and their reactions to the various criminals that pass through the cell door are priceless. Though this first season is hampered with a bit of Barney's home life, and the awful scenes of Barney's wife played by the perpetually unfunny Barbara Barrie, it's still a great dvd set. Abe Vigoda's facial expressions and dry one-liners are a riot, and you will find yourself rewinding scenes to catch what you missed while laughing. Jack Soo is terrific. He gets some of the biggest laughs on the show with just simple lines or looks, not since Jack Benny has someone been able to do so much while doing so little. Another great thing about ""Barney Miller"" is that you really develop an emotional attachment to these characters, so when something happens to them, Wojo getting poisoned, or Chano having to deal with shooting two bank robbers, you genuinely care for them. Nothing was ever forced on this show, and if you aren't familiar with it, pick up this set, give it one or two shows until you really get familiar with the characters and you will find yourself going back and re-watching favorite episodes, or thinking about something that happens on a show and chuckling throughout the day.

1841655,5,B00008EY6N,"After growing up with a 34 year veteran of the Chicago Police Department (my Dad) and watching numerous police shows (just about all) and interviewing many, many police officers, the one thing they all agree on is that Barney Miller is the most realistic police show on TV. My Dad (retired in 1986) spent 27 years as a detective. At his station he was able to name a real detective that was the dublicate of each charactor on the show.",1078272000,9,435,4.45
1841656,5,B00008EY6N,"Barney Miller received the Emmy for Best Comedy in its final season (it went off air in 1982); it was sort of a cumulative Emmy for a show that had never really become a hit (although it was often in the top 20).  Starting as a mid-season replacement in January 1975 (hence the 13 episode first season), the show slowly built from a less subtle comedy with a heavy dose of domestic sitcom  and some rather crudely drawn characters into a subtle, intelligent program with ongoing story arcs (Wojo's struggle to pass the Sergeant's exam, Barney's marital and promotion woes, Harris's rise and fall as an author) that were only completed at show's end.
Of course, most great shows have a great cast who truly seem to enjoy working together.  Barney M is no exception.  Hal Linden was great as the moral and logistical center of the show, a true father figure and solid straight man.  Mas Gail as Wojo was sort of the naive conscience of the show, thinking nothing of bringing the Pentagon in to the 12th Precinct to face a battery of questions on Agent Orange.  Ron Glass, as the supremely ambitious, tremendously literate Harris was a rare representation of an African-American male that didn't focus exclusively on his race (but didn't ignore it completely either, as witnessed by the Emmy-winning episode ""The Harris Incident"").  Jack Soo as the bizarrely deadpan Yemana, Ron Carey as the resentful/insecure/yet surprisingly resourceful Leavitt was a revelation as the show wore on.  Steve Landesberg's Dietrich was a good counterpoint to some of the flashiness of Harris or emotionality of Wojo, with his drier than dry wit.
This may be a controversial observation, but I felt the show improved with the departure of Abe Vigoda's Detective Fish, whose emphasis on schtick took away from the show's more subtle comedy.  I've read that Vigoda even requested that the show be renamed ""Fish and Barney Miller.""  Can you imagine?
The one criticism I might have of the show is that the show was not as generous with its female characters as it came to be with its male characters.  My wife loves Barney Miller, but often finds the show's tendencies toward ""ladies of the night with hearts of gold"" a little grating.
Still this show's portrayal of the dynamics of the workplace and how several diverse men work things out together with respect, care and openness while being constantly funny is a great accomplishment.  Throw in that the show is sort of a record of key issues and trends of the seventies (mindless bureaucracy, bankrupt cities and their budget cuts, sperm banks, environmental issues, Native Americans, Viet Nam vets, oddball cults, etc., etc.), and this is a show that shouldn't be missed.  It's a show that can make  you laugh and once in a while make you cry.  And it always made me think.  Can't ask for more than this.
The first season was a good start.  There are 170 episodes total.  Can't wait for the next 157!",1078012800,14,2930,4.779761904761905

What other sitcom has an entire cast of characters as brillantly developed as this one?  Can you pick out your favorite character?  It's difficult when they all were so fabulously portrayed by each member of the cast.
Unfortuantely, like the other reviews have stated, the picture quality for some of the episodes is questionable but worth the annoyance.  Come on Sony, bring on season 2.",1077753600,5,727,4.82258064516129
1841659,5,B00008EY6N,"It's disheartening to realize that what is arguably the greatest sitcom ever (there has surely never been a _better_ one) -- would almost certainly not have made it in today's market.
The first four episodes aren't very good. The Flicker/Arnold wit is present, but the overall tone is loud and raucous (as is the laugh track). Hal Linden - a broad and unsubtle actor - is given too many comic lines, which are not only inappropriate for a police captain, but which he handles poorly. The ""goofy criminal"" format is in place, but the plotting too often falls back on sitcom clichs. Wojo is stupid, obnoxious, and mean-spirited. And the impeccable comic timing the series was justly famous for is missing.
There's a good chance that, if these episodes were aired today, ""Barney Miller"" would not have time to ""find itself"" or build an audience, and ABC would kill it after a half-dozen episodes. We would never have had ""Mooshi-mooshi!"" or ""Too many carbohydrates?"" or ""Oh, my God! I ate my eraser!"" (Not really. On a 36"" screen, you can see it's still there.)
Episode 5 marks the turning point. The arch, over-the-top tone is gone. There is no ""plot"" leading up to any sort of ""payoff."" Barney is more of a straight man reacting to the craziness going on around him, and his wife is on her way out. The laugh track is subdued; it sounds as if it's coming from a live audience watching the performance. Wojo is morphing into a complex, sympathetic character -- and we start to see what an exceptionally fine actor Max Gail is. (God, what cute little ears!) Most significantly, the show is not afraid to have a serious moment - in this episode, Wojo's fixation on reforming prostitutes, which would become a running story element. ""Barney Miller"" is _finally_ ""Barney Miller"" -- one of the finest examples of impossibly clever writing and inspired ensemble acting ever to grace American TV.
The improvement is so substantial that the last episode of the first season is one of the greatest sitcom episodes of all time. It handles a serious subject -- how does a policeman react to having to kill a criminal? -- and reduces the audience to tears.
One of the high-water marks in the history of television. Unhesitatingly and unreservedly recommended.
A note about picture quality... The image is slightly soft and occasionally smeary. ABC's cameras are badly adjusted, with severe misconvergence and poor inter-camera matching. There is noticeable improvement at episode 8, but the image is still (no surprise) not up current standards. My gut feeling is that ""Barney Miller"" always suffered from a lack of sharpness and detail, and whatever problems exist with this transfer were present in the original tapes. But my memory isn't perfect -- and 30 years ago I was watching on a Sony KV-1920, which, though one of the best color TVs of its day, was not appropriate for critical monitoring.
PS: My local Best Buy ordered exactly _one_ copy of Season 1, and it sat there for over a week until I bought it. If you want Sony to release the other six seasons, you'd better darned well buy _this_ one.",1077667200,13,3091,4.768656716417911
1841660,5,B00008EY6N,"Who can forget that classic bass line intro! Barney Miller is finally on DVD in a two DVD set featuring the first 13 episodes of season 1 totally uncut and commercial free for the first time!  Barney Miller ran from Jan. 1975 to May 1982 (8 seasons, 170 episodes).  The sitcom was a new concept, concerning a group of Police Detectives and their Captain and the goings-on in a NY precinct squadroom.  The cast, which would make slight changes over the years, had to be one of the most diverse in TV history.  In season one, the cast includes Barney (Hal Linden), Wojciehowicz (Max Gail), Harris (Ron Glass), Fish (Abe Vigoda), Yemana (Jack Soo) and Chano (Gregory Sierra).  Season 1 is also the only time Barney's whole family were shown.  In Season 2, only his wife Elizabeth (Barbara Barrie) had appearances and by Season 3, even she was written out of the show.  Barney Miller is a rare sitcom from the 70s that is essential and makes a welcome addition to other classics like All in the family, Sanford & Son, and the Jeffersons.  Season one includes these episodes:
Disc One:
01. Ramon
02. The experience
03. Snow job
04. Graft
05. Courtesans
06. Stakeout
07. The Bureaucrat
08. Ms. Cop
09. The vigilante
Disc Two:
10. The guest
11. Escape artist
12. Hair
13. Hero
Trivia:
*The characters of Barney, Wojo, & Harris would be the only detectives to remain throughout the entire series as regular cast members.  Fish left after 3 seasons, Chano after 2, and Yemana after 4 (Jack Soo passed away in January 1979).  In season 3, Detrich (Steve Landesberg) & Levitt (Ron Carey) would join the cast as regulars until the series ended.
*Look for Linda Lavin (TV's Alice) in episode 8 debuting as Det. Janice Wentworth.  She would make appearances in the second season as well.
*Before Barney Miller, Gregory Sierra (Chano) was popular for his role as Fred and Lamont's neighbor, Julio, who had a pet goat named Chico, on Sanford & Son.  He made appearances on everything from All in the Family (where he had no accent) to Miami Vice.  After Barney Miller, Sierra joined the cast of Soap.
*One of the main series writers, Reinhold Weege, previously wrote on M*A*S*H* and went on to create one of the funniest sitcoms ever, Night Court! (by the way, where's season one?!!)
Jack Soo (1916-1979)
James Gregory (Insp. Frank Luger) (1911-2002)
Florence Stanley (Bernice Fish) (1924-2003)

1841663,5,B00008EY6N,"Barney Miller may be the most underrated show in television history. Rarely has there been a show with such complimentary casting and writing. This series belongs in the same category as the Dick Van Dyke Shows and Andy Griffith Shows. It was realistic without being maudlin and funny without being insultingly stupid. The best of what is available on TV today isn't even close to measuring up to the worst Barney Miller show episode - not that I can even think of a bad one.
I truly hope that this is just the first release of what will be the whole 7 seasons of Barney Miller on DVD. I feel somewhat shortchanged that the first season was only the 13 episodes but I'm just thrilled it is finally available. If you remembered and loved Barney when he was first on, this DVD will be a wonderful trip down memory lane while also being a sad reminder of how low television has sunk.

We thought that Gregory Sierra was great as Julio on ""Sanford & Son"", and we enjoyed him just as much on ""Barney Miller"".  The multicultural crew was a tremendous mix of people and personalities. We thought ""Barney Miller"" was one of the funniest shows on TV.  This wasn't one of the seasons that won an Emmy, but a good season anyway.  As others have noted, the video quality is not the best.  The audio is acceptable with the dialogue being understandable in most places.  I don't mind the lack of extras.  I'd rather have no extras than something thrown  together at the last minute.  It would have been great to have the pilot, ""The Life and Times of Barney Miller"".  The price seems a bit high for only 13 episodes.  (""Gilligan's Island"" has 36 episodes and the pilot episode for only a few dollars more!)  We loved the comedy on this show.

2. Experience:  Detective Fish thinks about retiring.  A bomb is left at the precinct.
3. Snow  Job:  Wojo has been entrusted with cash from a department store during a blizzard.
4. Graft:  An inspector arrives to investigate possible corruption at the precinct.
5. The Courtesans:  When Wojo tries to reform a hooker, she threatens to file harrassment charges.
6. Stakeout:  A stakeout operation is threatened by some nosy neighbors.
7. Bureaucrat: A drunken bureaucrat is jailed.
8. Ms. Cop:  Linda Lavin's first episode as a ""by-the-book"" cop.
9. Vigilante:  An elderly man defends his neighborhood.  An inspector insists that the 12th precinct should be hated by the citizenry.
10. The Guest:  Wojo eats a poisoned sandwiched intended for a mob prisoner.  Chano sets up a drug buy with his coworkers' money.
11. Escape Artist :  The 12th precinct holds an escaped prisoner.  Harris starts writing a police novel.
12. Hair:  A long-haired scruffy type from Narcotics is transferred to the precinct.  Fish's afternoon at a massage parlor upsets his wife, Bernice.

I was just a teenager when it was on originally, and I was afraid I would find it cheesy and dated, that maybe Id gotten too jaded to enjoy it; but while the set and costumes are vintage, the premise of the show is timeless. Nothing meaningful here, just nice, clean laughs. No potty humor, no foul language.  And all these years later, it still entertains.  Its a shame I have to reach back 30 and 40 years to find tv that I can watch with every generation of my family and not worry. Ill just be thankful these shows are available at all.",1509580800,2,889,4.343373493975903

7982217,5,B00008EY6N,Purchased Barney Miller season one to stream for my 93 year old father who has always been a fan of the TV show but has not been able to find it anywhere in his TV viewing area. Told him I will purchase season two once he gets through season one. I believe there were eight seasons in total however looks like only the first two seasons are available to purchase for streaming through Amazon. Hope for more seasons in the future.,1502064000,,429,4.308641975308642
