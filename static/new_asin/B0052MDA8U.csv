8454007,5,B0052MDA8U,"Here we are with the tenth boxset of Prisoner: Cell Block H and nearly at the halfway stage. Episodes 289 - 320 are included in this set and provide hours worth of solid drama. Episodes 287 - 327 are probably my favourite episodes of the whole series and feature Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) settling into Wentworth and setting her own rules towards the ladies of Wentworth. Both staff and prisoners alike unite to try to rid Wentworth of The Freak. Will they succeed?
We also see a terrific storyline involving the murder of local prostitutes and he search for their killer. How will new inmate Hannah Simpson (Julieanne Newbould) react to the unwanted advances from The Freak? How will Erica Davidson (Patsy King) deal with ""the most disgusting thing I have seen in Wentworth"" (the bashing of Chrissie Latham)? Will Bea Smith (Val Lehman) be able to return to the workforce problem-free? Who will win in the custody fight for Chrissie's (Amanda Muggleton) daughter? How will Doreen (Colette Mann) fare on her release?
New prisoners in this era include Sally Dempster (Liz Harris), Donna Mason (Arkie Whiteley), Paddy Lawson (Anna Hruby), Maxine Daniels (Lisa Crittenden) and Barbara Fields (Susan Guerin) who add heaps to the tension with The Freak.
Originally screened in Australia between July and October 1982, these episodes hit UK screens in the Midlands between March and June 1989 followed by regional airings between 1991 and 1994 on ITV in other parts of the UK.
Even without my favourite character Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence), these episodes are top notch!!
Enjoy!",1332720000,,1582,5.041984732824427
