8499773,2,B006JPT3CQ,"Title = False.  It's all about the chair.  He's obsessed with the chair.  Why?  Because he knows he needs it.  Also, saying that all people in wheelchairs can do what he does is just wrong.  He seems to have a pretty mild form of MD, has plenty of money OR his family has plenty of money, and he always had multiple people around to assist him.  There are many people with MD out there who are completely dependent, mostly dependent, completely immobile, mostly immobile, and many of them are also poor and could never do what this guy did.  I believe this film was meant to be inspirational, but this guy's just annoying, especially when he talks about the ADA and his expectations.  Dude!  Research accessibility in countries you plan to visit.  Don't just expect everything to be accessible.  That's not how this works.

1 Star for making us laugh + 1 Star for showing us some places we'll never see.",1387238400,,903,4.53416149068323

8499776,5,B006JPT3CQ,"We've know Andrew Shelley since he was a little boy, and we've been impressed by his intellect, charm and inner strength since the day we met him.  It was no surprise us that Andrew would one day travel to the ends of the earth to prove to himself and demonstrate to others that fears and physical and mental challenges can be over come by sheer will. The great thing is that this film was created so that his story can be shared around the world.

Watch this movie alone, then with your friends, children and parents.  It's incredibly uplifting and the real life story of how an engineer living and working in LA decides to leave his wheel chair bound job for the adventure of a lifetime.

For additional insight into the film, put yourselves in the shoes of his brother, parents and grandparents who support his efforts and send him off on his travels believing in him all the way, yet fearful of what might happen during his travels.",1324339200,,936,4.488235294117647
8499777,5,B006JPT3CQ,"This is an inspiring story of one man's fight against the effects of an inexorable disease. There are wonderful shots of the culture and geography of the five countries Andrew Shelley visited on his trip.  At a time when people are feeling isolated and overwhelmed by the problems of the world, this documentary shows time and again, the kindness that all humans have in abundance, but often don't express.
Most important of all, this film is a clear call for more research into Muscular Dystrophy in all it's varied forms.",1324252800,,523,4.811111111111111
8499778,4,B006JPT3CQ,This documentary is inspiring. The star Andrew (who was born with muscular dystrophy) is amazing. He does more things from his chair than most people do on their two legs. Good film making and the editing is spot on.,1324252800,,216,4.564102564102564
