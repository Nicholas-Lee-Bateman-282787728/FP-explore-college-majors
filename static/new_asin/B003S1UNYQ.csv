4187494,2,B003S1UNYQ,"This movie shows you a weird shrinking bubble in the music industry, inside of which are a lot of old guard music executives, producers and hangers on (like the photographer at the center of the story) with a lot of influence and money, yet completely caught up in their nostalgia for the good old days. Why is it so important for Robert Knight to find the next young white blues hot shot? When has this music made any kind of cultural or financial impact on the music scene? It's truly remarkable how much time and resources they put into jump starting this Taylor Bryant kid's career. The likelihood of this kid becoming a true visionary of the guitar like Jeff Beck or Steve Vai is highly unlikely. It's depressing to see how much time and money is wasted shoehorning this kid into success, when there are so many other creative and innovative rock bands that would take off if they could just be heard.",1296864000,3,906,4.530487804878049

Robert Knight is tryuly a magical photographer with no ego willing to help aspiring musicians

A must for any music lover",1292371200,5,205,4.694444444444445
4187496,5,B003S1UNYQ,"I'm not sure who came up with the title of this rock music documentary but it will certainly confuse folks. The 80-minute film will be shown on many PBS stations during the fall. Even reading the press description I wasn't sure what to expect and even while watching it, the film changed directions a lot. But that's a good thing. There are really three different focuses to Direct John Chester's 2009 film - which won audience awards at a number of regional film festivals.

On its surface the film is a documentary about 60-year-old rock photographer Robert Knight. This is the guy who, not only took the last concert photos of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn, but also shot many iconic photos for album covers and the Guitar World instrument stores. As he self-narrates the film, you begin to feel the guy has one heck of an ego. He takes us to visit rock guitar icons (he specializes in guitarists) like Jeff Beck, Slash and Carlos Santana. Next we hear how he loves to ""discover"" bands and we see how he took an unknown band from Australia, Sick Puppies, and, by using his contacts in the music industry got them a record contract and a Top 10 hit.  This, and the story of a 16-year old electric guitar prodigy who  Knight makes connections for, form the middle part of the film. But there's a non-musical undertone to the story as we meet Knight's mother who has Alzheimer's Disease and is running up huge medical bills. Why this part of the story is important forms the third ""act"" in the film's story arc. And I'll leave that for you to discover. Its much more interesting if you don't know in advance.

If you are a guitar player you will definitely want to see this film. If you are a music fan, you'll probably to as well. But even the casual record collector will find himself or herself drawn in to the story. And there's a unique Jimi Hendrix connection that will interest Hendrix fans.

The bonus features are well done as well. I did not listen to the director's commentary so I can't judge that but the ""Deleted scenes"" offer even more insightful comments from Beck, Santana, Steve Vai and some delicious stories from the recently deceased photographer Jim Marshall. I guess they were deleted because of length but they are wonderful.

This film is certainly a departure from normal PBS shows but it may help them reach a new generation.

4187497,5,B003S1UNYQ,not what i thought it was going to be when i ordered but i was pleasantly suprised! very interesting film. this mans life in photography was amazing!,1357430400,,149,4.555555555555555
4187498,5,B003S1UNYQ,This is a great great documentary plus you get so see some rock legends close up and learn some rock history as well as see rock history being made. There's nothing about this film I didn't like. Definitely worth going out of your way to see this one.,1352851200,,251,4.25
4187499,4,B003S1UNYQ,"I really liked this movie, and thought it was well done.  I'm not sure about the title though, and almost passed over watching this because of that.  I'm glad I didn't.  It's an interesting account of a photographer who has made his living photographing musicians, many of them very famous.  I'm glad that they balanced this out and didn't spend the whole time dwelling on the past and just a few musicians.  This is more about the person who took the photos and some of the challenges he's faced, including dealing with an elderly mother with Alzheimer's Disease.  It's touching on many levels and not about some guy's ego or claim to fame.",1347148800,,641,4.628318584070796
4187500,5,B003S1UNYQ,This film is well made and really entertaining.  It takes you on a great journey through the lives of some of the most talented rock stars.,1345939200,3,139,4.346153846153846
4187501,3,B003S1UNYQ,"The film ends with Knight being honored for his decades of work and being feted by Slash, the guitarist from Guns-N-Roses and Velvet Revolver. It's a nice contrast to such dour rock documentary as that seen in The Mayor Of The Sunset Strip, wherein another middle aged hanger-on to the stars is featured. In that film, the main subject is a deluded and sad DJ, Rodney Bingenheimer, barely clinging on to fame, and whose life is portrayed as lonely and sad, and he, too, has to deal with an aging and dying mother. But that film is more predictable, and plays off of stereotypes that it almost goes out of the way to embody. By contrast, this film does not do that, even though, in an online interview director Chester claims he had so much footage he could have made another film; one wherein Knight's obsessions with UFOs and conspiracies (augmented with footage of Knight at the infamous Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada) could have been the focus. I, however, am glad the film did not go there. First, it would have made Knight look wackier than he already is- an old man still going to rock concerts. Second, it would have just fed the same sorts of stereotypes that abound about obsessive folks, and those involved in the sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle, as total lunatics. The emphasis on a son's desire to care for his mother, and seeing footage of the two of them together, is far more powerful, especially when seeing how contently oblivious his mother is. Alzheimer's is a disease that does not pain, only destroys.

  Having said that, Knight is a bit of an oddball, as he recounts the last day of his friend Stevie Ray Vaughn's life, in 1990, before the famed guitar hero died in a plane crash: `If anything ever happens, you'll know me when you hear me.' Hence, Knight's pursuit of the gifted Tyler Dow Bryant, who, himself, longs to be the greatest guitarist that ever lived. But, he's still several steps above Rodney Bingenheimer, or any of the other social misfits that populate typical rock documentaries, and which were so brilliantly skewered in Rob Reiner's This Is Spinal Tap. Other musicians that appear and/or are interviewed in the film include Aerosmith, Jeff Beck, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana, ZZ Top, Def Leppard, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Joe Bonamassa. The film is a straightforward look at the life and dilemma that befalls Knight, so don't expect any great cinematography, not editing tricks. Do expect a satisfying look into the rock world, but an even more interesting look away into the real world at its edges. Robert Knight is not a great photographer, but he is an interesting human being, and this film's success relies on the latter, because the former, while it might be interesting to learn the finer points of the craft, would likely have been an exercise in tedium. What this film gives us is the medium. And with that you get the man.",1340236800,3,2880,4.676528599605523
4187502,5,B003S1UNYQ,"This is a great film about one man's work and contribution to both photography and the music industry. Glad I made this purchase and highly recommend it. I'm a big Sick Puppies fan so this purchase was a bit of a no brainer for me, but I really liked the inspirational story and decided to get my own copy instead of watching it over and over again on Netflix.",1308182400,2,360,4.231884057971015
4187503,5,B003S1UNYQ,"I discovered Robert Knight on the internet while looking up Rock Photographers almost 10 years ago. I came across his Zeppelin photos and wanting to be rock photog myself I contacted him via email and would ask him questions on the industry as he has a ton of experience. I have found him to be extremely passionate about what he does and very willing to share his experiences. A lot of photogs have such massive egos (as I have come to discover in my own experiences)that just asking a question will get you a dirty look or a nasty comment.
I was fortunate enough to be at the screening of Rock Prophecies here in Las Vegas where I met Robert for the second time. The documentary for me was a personal journey of his passion for music and photography. His journey is one that I could only hope to have. How many people get to have the experiences in music that he has? Shooting Zeppelin in Hawaii getting off the plane holding the masters for Led Zep 2, last photos of Jimmy Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn, and not to mention gaining the trust and friendship of some of my hero's!
If you love music and rock photography, this is an awesome documentary to have in a collection.

4187504,2,B003S1UNYQ,"Do yourself a favor and rent this. When the photographer is not whining about his parents he is trying to be a talent scout to a kid who won a guitar center contest. The photographer works for Guitar center, BTW.
Or he is trying to promote a band. Probably the most annoying thing about this picture is this very unattractive old mans ego. There is a close up shot of his face every 10 seconds. Imagine your grandfather dressed head to toe in Ed Hardy making an ass out of himself trying so desperately to be hip and you will get the idea. If you are a musician you will find this whole thing even more hilarious, especially the NAMM sequences.",1298592000,2,644,4.330578512396694
4187505,4,B003S1UNYQ,"I enjoyed watching most of this video, as it reminds me of the Tom Dowd biopic, where a ""behind the scenes"" guy finally gets some recognition of his own! I used to cover my walls with guitar player posters, and I remember seeing how so many of them listed ""Robert Knight"" as the credited photographer. It intrigued me, causing me to think, ""Man, this guy got around!"" Well, this video tells his story!

However, I agree with other reviewers in that a little too much focus in this video is placed on Robert's ""new finds."" Actually, I didn't really mind seeing the in-depth story of his discovery of Tyler Dow Bryant, especially considering that Tyler's mom is incredibly hot, but I too am disappointed that there wasn't more storytelling about how he came about snapping his more legendary photos of Hendrix, Vaughan, Zeppelin, etc. Also, it must be disappointing for Mr. Knight that Tyler Dow Bryant has not exactly exploded onto the scene. Sure, he's a talented musician, but I couldn't even find one album of his for sale on Amazon--just an mp3 single, that's all. What happened? This was about 2 years ago, right? Within another couple of years, he'll no longer be a teenager, and there goes his ""teenage prodigy"" marketing moniker right out the window. Too bad.

I get my feathers ruffled when I hear ""THE NEXT STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN""...there is NEVER going to be the next Stevie Ray Vaughan. But of course, some things said in the video in reference to Bryant make that implication. In fact, SRV's legendary ex-Road Manager Cutter Vandenberg makes an appearance in the film with Tyler, and claims that Tyler's fingers are just like Stevie's...I haven't seen Tyler's or Stevie's hands in person like Cutter has, but I nevertheless wonder if all this talk is just a lot of hoopla for the film. Knight meets with a couple of high-profile producers to sell them on Tyler (one of whom is Kevin Shirley, Joe B.'s producer). They both act (no pun intended) highly interested...well, where is the album either one of them has produced? I can't find it.

Personally, I don't hear too much of Stevie in Tyler's playing, anyway. He's really good, sure, but his style on the electric seems to lean more to rock than blues, and from what I've heard so far, he's nowhere near the league of Satriani or Vai. Is he going to turn the guitar world (especially the blues guitar world) on its ear like Stevie did? I highly doubt that. Knight then goes onto cite Joe Bonamassa as a previous teenage guitar prodigy who faced career decisions early in life similar to Tyler's. Good point, and may I say, Joe Bonamassa has come closer to matching SRV's impact on the music world than Bryant (so far, anyway), and even Joe is not exactly the ""next SRV"". And again, no one is! If Robert Knight thinks he's going to top--or even come close to equalling--the importance of his success with Hendrix and Vaughan, then I think he's up in the Knight! Sorry, couldn't resist! :-)

But anyway, complaints aside, I did enjoy this documentary, and was glad I could finally ""meet"" this name captioned on all those famous photos!",1297641600,,3093,4.69060773480663
4187506,3,B003S1UNYQ,"Not a bad film, but I would have preferred for the focus to have remained on the stories behind Knight's photos of the legends (Hendrix, Zep, etc.)  Too much time spent on inconsequential acts like Sick Puppies and Tyler Dow Bryant.  I didn't think either performer brought anything new or particularly interesting to the table.  Knight seems like a good guy, but there is a more interesting story here (with regard to his iconic photos) that simply wasn't told.  A shame, really.",1296950400,4,480,4.817073170731708

It provides an inside look at the music industry from a unique point of view. Robert is not only an amazing photographer, but also a lover of rock music and a champion of talented, yet relatively unknown musicians. His determined efforts toward promoting their careers are both admirable and inspiring. Heartily recommend this DVD purchase.",1493942400,,462,5.256756756756757

8403946,5,B003S1UNYQ,"I remember the terrible day when I learned Stevie Ray Vaughan had died...After that, years went by with neither pictures nor concert footage from Alpine Valley WI.  I was so pleased to view this documentary of the photography of Robert Klein (photographer of the last concert of Vaughan). As the memories came flooding back...so did some of the pictures!

From a Baptist-fundamentalist minister father, along with a mother who told him that his photography wouldn't necessarily hold a lot of weight, Robert went out into the music business.  Of his rock and roll shoots, he adds;  ""Some people collect stamps, some people collect butterflies; I think I kinda collect rock stars"".  Throughout a sixty year life, Robert has taken over 200,000 images, including the infamous shots of SRV.  ""The minute you stop reaching, you will be irrelevant"" drives Knight along with a quest for passing on the 'spirit' of Stevie Ray to another.

""The music business is a young man's game"", being told he was ""too old"" and ""not artistic""; Knight has photographed bands and artists from Elton John, Led Zeppelin, BB King to Frank Zappa and ZZ Top.  Always going forward until now.  An extremely personal, family issue is in front of Knight while he looks at his career and his adequacy in the Music Scene.

The introduction of a new band (Sick Puppies), and a very interesting rock/blues guitarist, Tyler Dow Bryant (Winner of 2007's, Robert Johnson's New Young Blues-Guitarist Award), keeps Robert Knight interested in passing on that spirit of excellence and quality of his work. This includes a myriad of photos (basically a publicly unseen collection) of Jimi Hendrix which is richly explored in the film.

This music infused documentary swaps and drops so many band names along with pictures and quotes from the legends.  Truly an inspiring and insightful view that certainly took me back.",1370390400,2,1876,5.016129032258065

8403949,4,B003S1UNYQ,"I do music photography. Unfortunately not for a living because nowadays everybody and their mother has a camera. Photographers are a dime a dozen.
Guys like Robert and Mark Weiss are fortunate because they started doing this many years ago, way before there were so many restrictions on photographers.
They got their foot in the door early and that's huge. Having early photos of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and others is priceless. A fellow photographer told me
about Robert so I rented the DVD and I enjoyed it. You don't have to be a music photographer to enjoy this DVD but if you are you'll probably relate to a lot
of what Robert talks about. I think it's great that he tries to help up and coming artists since he's got a lot of connections in the business. You can
rent the DVD and check it out like I did before you buy it. I enjoyed it and I'm sure some of you will as well.
