2394731,5,B000AWKSR8,"When on earth is someone going to pay proper homage to the work of Shirley Clarke? Her documentaries are all but unavailable commercially in the United States, including this amazing 1967 one-on-one with a 'street hustler.' M Snively (below) has done an admirable job of describing the basic 'plot' and emotional impact of the film. My only addition to the discussion is: Please release this damn thing on a US-friendly DVD format! And soon. It is an amazing, engrossing, and personal portrait of a certain aspect of 1960's sociality, an entirely engaging and informative perspective on alternative lifestyle. LONG past due for an American DVD release. Someone please come along and do this film--and filmmaker--justice.

P.S. 2015: Good to see that Milestone has released a US-friendly, restored blu-ray version! Search Amazon for it. A documentary well worth owning.",1282608000,14,868,5.2898550724637685
2394732,4,B000AWKSR8,"Portrait of Jason is a documentary-esque film with only one character, Jason. The man is placed in front of a camera and is asked to tell stories about his life experiences. In a comfortable living room setting, Jason unravels his words in front of us, liquor shot after shot and acting so flamboyant we can't help but want to befriend him. But the ""him"" is the true weight of the plot as the ""him"" is undefinable. The film has no one in control, whereas usually a director claims this controlling role. As the film progresses, we start to not only see the characters inside of Jason, but that he is fooling us, so much that a viewer could begin to feel disgust towards this once-admired man. Who is in control now? Is it the actor Jason? The instigators off-camera, feeding him questions and requesting stories? Is it the viewer? The decline of Jason is so evident in this film that anyone can notice its tragedy. Whether we feel pity, anger, or happiness towards Jason, the film clearly depicts something too real and so personal that we often end up questioning our own motives and words. Although sometimes the film is slow, it is captivating and personal nevertheless, and a more than interesting look into the life of a self-defined ""Queen"" of the late 60s.",1260316800,13,1263,4.642857142857143

2394735,5,B000AWKSR8,"This is a fascinating film, both because you are aware of the presence of the director Shirley Clarke & her film crew and that their subject --Jason --is ""entertaining"" the filmmakers, but also because Jason reveals the poignant reality of being a gay, black man in 1960's America.",1455580800,3,281,4.875

2394737,5,B000AWKSR8,"This is a ground breaking documentary in that we don't have a lot of LGBT materials from the 1960 representing a segment of the black (African-American) experience.  As one of my friends said ""Its the black version of Boy's in the Band!"" and I would agree with that assessment.  If you are interested in getting a glimpse into the life of Jason and how he lived and also see the psychological pain of living as a fully expressed gay or bi-sexual man during those times then I would recommend this be part of your DVD collection.",1447372800,8,528,4.489583333333333

8079985,1,B000AWKSR8,"I would give it no stars if I could. The out-of-focus treatment literally gave me a headache, which made it unwatchable. After about 20 minutes, I just didn't care about Jason at all. There are all sorts of ethical issues with the filmmaking (knowingingly getting him drunk, goading on his anger at the end), and there are some interesting stories that Jason has to share about a very interesting life experience, but the focusing issue, which is clearly a choice, made it unwatchable. So overrated.",1520294400,,499,4.882352941176471

8079992,4,B000AWKSR8,I have wanted to see this for years. Jason is very likable and intelligent.  I read that he was going to do a movie with Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgewick in the 60's such a shame it never happened.,1475452800,,195,4.0
