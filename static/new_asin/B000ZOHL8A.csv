8312799,4,B000ZOHL8A,"Policia de la Frontera is a film that stars Danny De La Paz in the early part of his career. It is fascinating to watch Danny and television's Kojac, Telly Savalas and  Eddie Albert (Green Acres) in the same film! It is also noteworthy to point out that this film was shot by master cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa one of the greats of all time. This may have been Gabriel's last film before he passed or close to it. Good story, a bit clumsy in the writing, but earnestly acted. Even Telly looks like he's into it. Love the hair, Danny!",1255824000,,538,4.38
