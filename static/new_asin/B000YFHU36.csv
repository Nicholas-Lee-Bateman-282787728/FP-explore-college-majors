8232532,3,B000YFHU36,"The graphics on this DVD are a little bit too modern for my taste.  I prefur VJ videos that are extremely dated looking.  The stuff on here except for the first video are way too polished looking.  The first video however was a trip back to Emergency Broadcast Network with its cut up footage of kung fu movies which I liked.  Also the second(?) video was a bit thought provoking as if to say that we are all biological machines in corporate america.  Kind of creepy, not something I want to think about when listening to music honestly.",1339545600,,537,4.438775510204081
8232533,5,B000YFHU36,This A/V Mix by the folks at Addictive TV is heavy on my viewing rotation! I wish I would have picked it up a good while back. I simply didn't know what I was missing. I'll be ordering more from these guys!,1237420800,,206,3.9285714285714284
