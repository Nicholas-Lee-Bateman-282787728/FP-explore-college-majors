8596382,1,B00DQNYBJO,"I actually saw this set at Target last night.  I like Laurel & Hardy.  They're funny without being too over the top, like the Three Stooges.  However, when I looked at the box, there was no listing at all of what movies actually made up this 11 hours od DVD.  The description here is just a vague.  Are we getting feature films like Way Out West and The Bohemian Girl, or just a bunch of early shorts and home movies?  I don't like to gamble with my money and it's not like it's easy to return these things once you've opened them and viewed the contents.  My guess is that t's 11 hours of shorts and fillers, otherwise they'd be more forthcoming on the contents.",1400198400,,663,4.256
