8576969,5,B00C3ALLT4,Adam West will always be Batman to audiences but this film was his best work.  Nancy Kwan is lovely in it. The backdrop of the era ( late 60s ) is what gives this film the aura it would not otherwise have.  This film is often confused with a 1964 film with John Saxon with the same name.  It is not,1379808000,4,298,3.8524590163934427

I have owned this since I paid a whopping sixty dollars in the early 1980s for a beta print from a company called K&C Video. I do not have a Blu-ray player, nor do I intend getting one, so I am glad I had the option to order the DVD.
I checked Google and found a site which has some twenty stills from the Blu-ray  edition, so I am hoping the DVD version will look just as good.
This is a film that has it all - great music, unforgettable dialogue, I won't give anything away, plenty of action, interesting sets, a cast of seasoned professionals. It is a real time capsule filmed in 1968 and partially financed by Mr West himself. It's a shame that he didn't get a chance to star in more leading roles in feature films following his stint as The Caped Crusader. I always thought this film should have midnight showings at theatres, with fans quoting the dialogue verbatim!
I and my friends have watched this film numerous times and we never tire of it. Buddy Greco sings some great tunes and has a nice featured part. Nehemiah Persoff, Nancy Kwan, Robert Alda, Patricia Smith and Mark Roberts are also in top form.
UPDATE: It just arrived today and it is amazing quality. I can actually read all the credits this time and it looks GREAT on our big screen TV. I have now confirmed that it was filmed in 1968 and released in 1969.",1372896000,13,1418,4.271375464684015
