7795543,5,1414323298,"I bought this video to use for a men's bible study the next day, because it said on the side ""Bonus Features: Study Notes"".  What I have since discovered is that if you simply play the video you will not see these.  If you play the video from the main menu starting with ""The themes"" listed on the dvd (ie chapters) each one will end with a series of questions related to that theme.  Very well done.  Could have been clearer they were there. I am a man after all and don't follow direction well.

Chapter 3 of the 6 Chapters of ""Quiet Strength: Mens Bible Study"" is included.  You can get the booklet on amazon for all of the chapters.  My guys in my small group loved it and are very engaged.  That is no tall order. Note: You can also get Chapter 1 downloaded from coachdungy.com if you want to try it out before you buy.

Love ya coach, still winning the game!",1378080000,2,864,4.1878787878787875
7795544,5,1414323298,My son is a athlete and I wanted him to have positive role models.  I believe that Mr. Dungy is such a man/coach.  I am looking forward to my son watching this man's legacy.  I am hoping that he will take the information and apply it to his own life in all areas.,1227571200,7,263,3.9245283018867925
