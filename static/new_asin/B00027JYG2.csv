8023311,5,B00027JYG2,"This show is a must not only to Spear's fans, but to all reggae fans. Excellent line up. The brass section is the real gem. The set list could not be better. Bringing his biggest hits available at the time, singing wonderfully well, supported by the awesome rhythm section, this french show could not fail.",1349395200,,306,4.581818181818182
8023312,5,B00027JYG2,"If you like roots reggae, you'll love this DVD.  I bought it for my husband, and he could not have been more pleased with it.  The Paris Zenith concert is absolutely wonderful because of the superb sound quality, Burning Spear (aka, Winston Rodney) sounding great, and he had a great band with him.  The horn section in his band was outstanding.  The South Africa portion of the DVD is cool, but it is short, only about 15 minutes long.  It is a cool interview with Burning Spear, with his words of wisdom, interspersed with short parts of songs from that concert.  Overall, the Paris Zenith concert may be the greatest Burning Sprear concert available on DVD, and this DVD is really worth buying!",1349049600,,697,4.626016260162602
8023313,1,B00027JYG2,"Do I have to explain the purpose of a review? My previous review had nothing to do with whether or not I like Burning Spear. It was completely about the actual DVD from production, quality, and song selection. It is sad that the previous reviewers are simply commenting on Burning Spear. If your point is to give him more respect, praise, and turn more people on to him, then this is definitely the wrong forum. I would suggest buying the original CD ""Live in Paris"" and leave it at that... Please don't waste your money as I did on this pile of @#$! Someone has put it out to obviously collect money from suckers who really wanted to see the performance. I'm sure even Winston Rodney would agree (although off the record.)",1308614400,,723,4.484848484848484
8023314,5,B00027JYG2,"There is no other like Winston Rodney and this Burning Spear Live in Paris video is beyond comparison! The music is so tight and perfect and the performance is electric, smooth, and seamless. I would love to have this playing over and over again in the background of my life! If you already have this DVD, you should purchase another as a backup and a third as a gift to someone you know who needs it!",1285459200,,401,4.2894736842105265
8023315,3,B00027JYG2,"This could have been so much better. The South Africa portion from 2000 is short, and the songs are incomplete, as interviews with Winston and fans break individual songs into segments. The live 88 footage from Paris is good, but a bit dark. The sound could have been better. If you're a fan, it's not too bad, but could have been so much more.",1212969600,3,344,4.390625
8023316,3,B00027JYG2,This is not the full concert and the picture was not digitaly enhanced. Horrible. 3star,1210204800,,87,4.866666666666666
8023317,1,B00027JYG2,"After waiting for years to finally see the concert footage from what I have always considered one of my favorite reggae CDs/Albums, this was disappointing beyond belief. I'm not sure what the other reviewers were watching and if they even watched it, all I can say is that they must work for the production company. This production is soooooooooo sub par, and the audio even worse. There is no apparent cohesion to the DVD at all, we don't even see a third of the concert. The interviews are pointless and don't give any ensight into Winston Rodney. (I've seen interviews with him and this does him no justice.) I can't really explain the level of my disappointment after waiting sooooo long for this to finally appear...",1199318400,2,721,4.73015873015873
8023318,5,B00027JYG2,"The first thing that blew my mind when I watched the concert footage was that the horn section was all female (trumpet, alto sax AND trombone), and those ladies can PLAY. Excellent dvd, great music, great quality. Burning Spear really brings it, and his music is loaded with passion and good vibes. I didn't care for the interviews in the first section, but the actual concert is fantastic. Buy this one, if you love roots reggae.",1198195200,,430,4.671052631578948
8023319,5,B00027JYG2,This is way worth the money!!! Two shows and a great intervue. Buy it you won't be disapointed!,1196208000,2,95,4.333333333333333
