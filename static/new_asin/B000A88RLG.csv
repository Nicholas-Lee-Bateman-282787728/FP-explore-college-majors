8076312,4,B000A88RLG,"This was a very different video! I'm not sure how it compares to other FitPrimes, as this was my first experience with the series. Although the name of the video is Weights + Cardio + Yoga, there was very little of the latter two, so I'd probably classify it as mostly a toning workout.

The workout begins with a 3 1/2 minute warm-up march; instructor and FitPrime founder Anna Benson uses simple foot patterns and arm movements similar to Leslie Sansone. Next comes three minutes of stretches using a balance stick--you could substitute a broom handle or skip this all together. Following the warm-up, there is an approximately 6 1/2 minute cardio section which uses light weights. This is very similar to Firm-style aerobics: your feet are constantly moving while your arms perform bicep curls, lat presses, etc.

I would have to classify the next 16 minutes as toning work, although Anna repeatedly says that you are ""using weights for cardio."" It's true that your heart raise does raise at times, but there are a lot of stops and starts. The moves include squats, step-ups using a tall box (I substituted a chair), a killer calf series, and more upper body work. One thing that I really liked about this section is that Anna has you focus on the weak side of your body: you always begin with this side and do more reps than on the dominant site. This was a unique feature which I've never before seen in a video.

Here's a breakdown of the final 12 minutes of the video: 6 minutes posture work sitting on the box (using weights), ending with a spinal twist; 2 minutes of abs work (really just some core-focused stretches); and a 4 minute cool down which consisted mainly of seated forward bends (other than the twist mentioned above, this was the only yoga in the workout). The total time came in at 42 minutes.

Overall, I found this workout to deviate quite a bit from how it's described on the box: there wasn't really much cardio/yoga, it was too easy in some parts but tough in others, and the abs work was practically non-existent. On the other hand, I really liked the uniqueness of some of the moves plus the focus on the weaker side of the body; I also liked that there was more upper than lower body work. Also, despite feeling some of the sections are too easy for me, I always feel this workout the day after I do it.  I use this workout as an alternate full-body toning program whenever I'm in the mood for something a bit different.

Instructor comments:  Anna Benson was behind the scenes for the Firm videos, and the box of this video says it is her first on-camera appearance. Her voice sounds very similar to Susan Harris (also from the Firm), although she is more soft-spoken. She cued well here and was gently encouraging, although she also uses some goofy metaphors (""imagine a choo-choo""). Anna works out on a small, cozy set (it looks like a home workout room) to mostly upbeat music.

Overall, this video does have some flaws, but I still like it and would recommend it if you're looking for something a bit different, especially for those at an advanced beginner to early intermediate level.",1129507200,17,3121,4.600719424460432
