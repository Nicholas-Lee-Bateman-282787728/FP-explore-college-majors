8458478,1,B0055OFHHM,DVD damaged. A few of the segments won't even play - the ones I wanted to see most! Very disappointed!,1486944000,,102,4.15
8458479,4,B0055OFHHM,"The pilates section is great! For the yoga, you are just told the poses as you move into it. If you are used to different names, it takes time to get used to their series",1431820800,,170,3.8857142857142857
8458480,3,B0055OFHHM,"Good potential, but the DVD was scratched or inconsistent, certain ""tracks"" replay over and over, and other tracks don't play at all. The ones that did play were fun and made me wish the others worked as well.",1411689600,,209,4.526315789473684
8458481,5,B0055OFHHM,"Difficulty: Medium.

It's a great video since it gives you the opportunity to cross-train whit great teachers.

I really like the cardio exercises given by Tanja Djelevic and I like the fact that you can customize your own workout by choosing what they call ""express workouts"" and mixing them up in the order that you like.
Highly recommend it.",1403222400,2,344,4.813559322033898
8458482,3,B0055OFHHM,"Gaiam has a habit of repacking their workouts.  I knew when I picked up this DVD at a discount score that in consisted of previously released workout segments by Tanja Djelevic, Rodney Yee, Suzanne Deason, and Anna Caban.  The problem is, Gaiam provides only vague descriptions on the DVD case; they do NOT reveal the source of the original DVD releases.

The first thing I realized after purchasing this DVD is that it contains EXACTLY the same ten workouts as another GAIAM re-release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Zen-Body-Toners/dp/B003ZZ7TLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Zen Body Toners</a>.  Are you kidding me, Gaiam--you released the same re-releases TWICE under two different names?  So, if you have Ten Zen Body Toners, DO NOT buy this DVD, as you will be getting the same thing under a new name!

Alright, on to the workouts.  The Main Menu of the DVD lists options for Express Body Target Workouts (6 total), Total Body Workouts (4 total), and Custom Workout.  Below I've listed all ten of the options on the DVD, starting with the target workouts and then moving on to the full-body.  I've also identified the original source material for each.

UPPER BODY CARDIO TONING, 16.5 minutes
This is with Tanja Dejlevic, from her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Burn-Sculpt/dp/B0017UOU5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio Burn Sculpt</a>&nbsp;(which in itself was a re-release of Total Body Cardio Toning).

LOWER BODY CARDIO TONING, 13 minutes
Also with Tanja Dejlevic, from her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Burn-Sculpt/dp/B0017UOU5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio Burn Sculpt</a>.

TEN ZEN CORE, 10 minutes
Another Tanja segment from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Burn-Sculpt/dp/B0017UOU5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio Burn Sculpt</a>.

YOGA LOWER BODY TARGET TONING, 25 minutes
This routine is Suzanne Deason's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lower-Body-Conditioning-Lower-Body-Yoga/dp/B001213CVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lower Body Conditioning: Lower Body Yoga</a>&nbsp;(like all Gaiam releases, this has gone through several name changes).

YOGA UPPER BODY TARGET TONING, 15 minutes
This is taken from Rodney Yee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Journal-s-Energy-Balance-Yoga/dp/B00008G76U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Journal's Energy Balance Yoga</a>; it is the third segment, ""Creativity,"" which was not necessarily designed as an upper body routine.

YOGA CORE EXPRESS, 6.5 minutes
This was also taken from Yee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Journal-s-Energy-Balance-Yoga/dp/B00008G76U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Journal's Energy Balance Yoga</a>--it's the second segment, ""Centering,"" which focuses on standing postures, not the core in particular.

TOTAL BODY CARDIO, 30 minutes
Again, a segment with Tanja from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cardio-Burn-Sculpt/dp/B0017UOU5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cardio Burn Sculpt</a>--as you can see, that's pretty much half the DVD!

TOTAL BODY YOGA, 45 minutes
This is the biggest ripoff on the DVD!  There is no unique footage here; it is simply the prior three yoga segments (i.e., the one from Deason and the two from Yee) played right after one another.  It should also be noted that the production values for these segments are quite poor (probably because they were originally released on VHS and later converted).

TOTAL BODY PILATES, 18 minutes
This is taken from the second (short) segment of Ana Caban's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Core-Challenge/dp/B000LSBXGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Core Challenge</a>&nbsp;DVD; rather than traditional mat work, it features many moves adapted from the Pilates apparatus machines.

Tanja teaches her segments live, but all of the other routines are taught via voiceover.  Although this DVD seems like a good deal, as it includes a lot of footage, I think it is too much of a mish-mash to truly be worthwhile.",1361664000,29,4293,7.2630560928433265
8458483,4,B0055OFHHM,"This video really kicks your butt, especially the 30 minute cardio workout! The yoga is also relaxing, but I am not a huge fan of the voice overs, hence my 4 stars. Otherwise, it your looking for a great workout that you can do at home, and it very little space, this is a great workout for you! You can also customize your workout, which helps you from getting bored!",1310342400,4,368,4.271428571428571
