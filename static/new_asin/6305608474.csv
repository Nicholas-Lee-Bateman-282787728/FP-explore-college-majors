7891839,4,6305608474,"This DVD provides a decent overview of attack aircraft, dating back to 1910.  It includes interviews of pilots of the time and original video of early flight.  At the end, it analyzes the future of attack aircraft and emphasizes stealth technology as the main driving force.
I didn't give this DVD 5 stars because I was looking for a little more depth into more recent attack aircraft, but that was a personal grievance and is not a criticism of the quality of this DVD.",1073433600,,470,4.583333333333333
