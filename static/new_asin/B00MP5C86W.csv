I always ""tape"" the episode on its first playing on BBC America; and watch and rewatch and rewatch, until my loooong-since pre-ordered (complete season) DVD comes.  I am always delighted and amazed to find the cut-out scenes, the new-to-me bits-and-pieces that Steven and Sue have cut to fit (but not ""suit"" {frown}) American TV.  I always buy the DVDs because I want the *whole* episodes.  This ""seen on American TV"" version makes me think it's still the cut-down (mutilated) version -- WHY would I buy that?!?!",1452643200,,637,4.81651376146789
