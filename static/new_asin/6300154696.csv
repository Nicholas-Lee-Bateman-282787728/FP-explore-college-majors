7803284,5,6300154696,"Look at my review for Watership Down and ditto it. Kids cartoons the way they SHOULD be, not the premature sexuality and extreme violence of todays animation. I like Japanese animation but I am forty years of age. My kids are not. White Seal is a children's cartoon, the way they should be. ""Nuff said.",1286064000,,302,4.509090909090909
7803285,5,6300154696,"I had completely forgotten that this movie existed!  I loved it as a small child.  My mother let me watch it over and over when I was little because it was so short.  It's so precious, and looks so classic and old-fashioned on-screen.  I must admit, though, that the animation definitely looks old and today's kids may want to watch Finding Nemo instead.",1117152000,,354,4.571428571428571
7803286,5,6300154696,"my dad read me the book from Rudyard Kippling ""the white seal"" almost every night till I was 13.  It has always been a favorite story of mine.  The movie stays true to the book, and actualy quotes it in the begining. My dad baught me the movie on VHS a long time ago, but it wore out after continuous viewing.  It is a great movie, I would recomend it to anyone.",1102636800,,362,4.0
7803287,5,6300154696,"I saw this when I was 12 and bought the laserdisc about ten years ago. All I can say is, it's a great animated special that will appeal to all ages.
The image that sticks out most is when the seal is swimming under this secret ocean tunnel to another world...pure magic.",1078876800,3,270,4.211538461538462
7803288,4,6300154696,"I never remember seeing this as a child. I watched LOTS of television, too.  I do enjoy Chuck Jones, and you can certainly see a few of his touches throughout this movie, even if you don't really try to find them.  The movie is okay, but not the best thing I have ever seen in my life.  A little sappy, and only 30 minutes long.  I really like the Bugs Bunny stuff better, but I gave it 4 stars because my kids really do like it, and sometimes you don't have time for a 90 minute movie (especially near bedtime!) if they ask to watch ""one more"" this (or Rikki Tikki Tavi) is a fine choice.",1020211200,7,589,4.051724137931035
7803289,5,6300154696,"I saw this show on TV eons ago.
It's the story of a sweet little white seal, Kotick, seen as an oddity by his fellows, but definitely not  inferior. Because of his aloneness, Kotick sees more around him than the  others, and must attempt to save them from seal-hunters.
There's a sweet  little substory about Kotick's relationship with his father--you'll want to  kick Dad at the beginning, and give him a friendly whap on the head at the  end.
An adorable little cartoon that won't make you throw up! (A rarity,  no?)",968544000,8,518,4.576086956521739
7803290,4,6300154696,"I would make mom rent this one over and over as a child, and she's never let me forget it! I saw this along with Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and Pamper the Penguin. If you know anything about those two movies you'll know what The  White Seal is like. It's one of those movies every child should see.",951091200,11,288,4.236363636363636
7803291,5,6300154696,"When I was a small girl living during the 1970s, they would air this cartoon as well as many animated shorts by the masterful Chuck Jones frequently as a TV show special and oh, I would always look forward to  seeing such an endearing white seal and the wonderfully mischievous  mongoose each time. Brings back such sweet memories. Today, as I am working  towards a future career as a cartoonist and an animator, Chuck Jones is now  one of my ""mentors"" and a great influence on the next generation  of cartoon geniuses!",946598400,,519,4.5978260869565215
7803292,5,6300154696,"Many people remember the mongoose that saved the garden from the wicked cobras, but some forget the equally charming white seal that saved his kind from the seal hunters by leading them to the secret island.  The same man  who brought Kipling's ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"" to television (Chuck  Jones) has also breathed life into another Kipling work, ""The White  Seal.""  The results are the same.  Chuck Jones has produced two  animated classics that the whole family will enjoy.  So  set aside a  special family night and watch Kipling's stories come to life.  It will be  time well spent.",926899200,4,582,4.947916666666667
