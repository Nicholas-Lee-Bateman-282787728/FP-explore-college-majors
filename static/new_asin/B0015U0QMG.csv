Here, I was bored by a cliche and contrived story, which as a twist and keeps you guessing, but is let down by the pace. It has a good looking cast and uses that for lengthy and pointless voyeuristic dancing scenes but not enough chemistry to provide substance.

Maybe I just didn't get it. But I don't reckon it's worth the watch.",1402444800,,404,4.386666666666667
8283231,2,B0015U0QMG,The spoken words of the characters don't match the movement of their mouths.  The timing is way off making it difficult to follow the story line.  Also there are torture scenes that are very difficult to watch.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1398643200,,254,4.7272727272727275
8283232,2,B0015U0QMG,"I hate not to be able to comment on the merits of the film, but as of this writing (1/19/13), once you get past the part where the name of the movie is shown (I believe the term is ""title sequence""), the audio and video on the streaming version are noticeably out of sync. I got the same result both with my Roku player and with watching the movie in my browser. I would love to be able to watch the whole movie, but I couldn't watch more than about 5-10 minutes without having to skip ahead, and I stopped less than an hour in.",1358553600,,528,4.038095238095238
8283233,3,B0015U0QMG,"I happened to see Guantanmero, almost by accident. I found it depressing annd confusing but also found myself thinking about it some time after...what was really happening?
My husband thought that Guido may have been Manuela's father. I wondered if Manuela and the prisioner where husband and wife all along. It makes sense when you think that Manuela's brother just dropped him off with his sister; as if he belonged there. Do brothers often leave suspicious strangers in their sister's homes? There was a little boy who kept showing up and was being embraced by the man in the closing scene. Could this have been his son?
Finding out that he was an American soldier and not an Afghan prisioner was wierd. The skinny woman who enjoyed torturing so much was of some importance to the whole story...but there was no develoment to that part of the story. She was just there, being horrible from start to finish. How many soldiers are like that, I wonder?
Still, I don't think I want to watch it again. Even though the music and dancing were good, It was just too depressing, and I just know that re-watching will not answer my questions.",1352592000,,1135,4.68
8283234,4,B0015U0QMG,"This movie is a surreal criticism of the tortures that are--according to Hollywood--taking place in Guantanamo.  The main character, a supposed terrorist suspect washed out of Guantanamo during a storm, is rescued by a beautiful night club dancer who invites him to live on with her platonically.  The whole thing is a bit much for Ali, our middle-eastern Muslim now in sensuous Cuba.  He is both appalled and attracted by the girl's life style.  He, of course, doesn't drink and is jerked back and forth by flashbacks of his Guantanamo tortures and his sexual dreams about his saviouress, Maria.

Ali is also full of repressed desire and guilt, also brought forth by his brutal interrogation.  Finally, the girl, who herself can stand it no longer, takes Ali to bed and tries to get him out of the country...but...she's hit by a car.

Ali, meanwhile, living in a world increasingly surreal, sees himself, alternately, as both the tortured and the torturer.  Reality comes back quickly now and he recognizes himself as an Army interrogator involved in the suicide of a terror suspect.  Guilt-ridden he cuts his wrists to be sent home to his wife....who just happens to be the beautiful Maria.

8283235,4,B0015U0QMG,"In Communist Cuba an escapee from the American marine torture camp
finds a somewhat new life.
This film is very hard to watch with torture scenes.
The dance and music is sort of a Salsa ballet of a floor show
in a night club offsets that.
The love affair develops slowly between the damaged
Arab and the Cuban woman dancer with the large heart.
Just who are Guido, Manuela and Ali?
All is really not as it seems!",1218585600,3,412,4.294871794871795
