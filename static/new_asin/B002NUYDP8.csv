8375471,5,B002NUYDP8,"I am an occupational therapist and have used this many times. I am considering purchasing it out of my own pocket because it is so effective.  I was in a conference room and the teachers who had used it (mostly borrowed from the other OT's that have it) and also one autism teacher who uses it were raving about it.  It is best for a classroom with an active board, has calming music and calming mirroring moves with many delightful expressions.  It helps students in many ways.  I will say that  I will not be purchasing it here because the official website has a much better price.",1409875200,5,583,4.411214953271028
8375472,5,B002NUYDP8,"I was substitute teaching at a school where many of the children had autism...I was amazed at how this calmed me !!  I wanted to buy it, but like the previous reviewer don't understand why it is so expensive at Amazon.com.",1376438400,3,222,4.414634146341464
8375473,1,B002NUYDP8,"Even before receiving this item, I am angry, it is available on thinkingmoves.com for $59.95!  This is over less than half for what I purchased it on Amazon.",1370217600,8,157,4.607142857142857
