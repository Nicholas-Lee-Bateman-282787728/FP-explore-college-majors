As far as the content thought I wish some other enterpirse would be able to release a new version of this movie, e.g., widescreen, original audio with subtitles, credits (hah!). Yes, that's correct this film goes to a black screen with no credits at the end of the movie!",1349136000,,460,4.3604651162790695
7883117,1,6305104042,"A waist of time!  One of the wost movies ive seen.  Awful fight scenes seems like the fighters are in slow motion doing beginner moves.  The story  drags for what seems to be days.  Not many fight scenes at all, and the  climactic fight wasn't even much better then the first fights, almost was  less entertaining. Overall this movie is not worth even renting, the only  way you should see this movie is the way i did, a friend let's you borrow  it.  that's it:)",965088000,,462,4.329411764705882
