6338121,5,B00J7YV09K,The acting is in the grand manner and shows what we've lost in films today.  The production values are of the highest order.  Such are the performances that they conceal a rather silly plot's shortcomings and lend it verisimilitude.  Bravo!!!,1402704000,2,242,5.0
6338122,5,B00J7YV09K,"Watching CARDINAL RICHELIEU for the first time was a delight. Was an actor more calm amid chaos than Mr. Arliss? Maureen more beautiful? And who is that wooing Maureen? Wow, its a young Cesar Romero! Edward Arnold plays the King, but it is George Arliss movie all the way. He is crafty, but we are on his side, since he justifies our faith in his character.

Similar to THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, from the same year I believe, you are never quite sure what will happen next. Who will win, who will lose? Whose plot will win? Will the lovers be together at the end? Some plot points are far-fetched, but you will be entertained nonetheless.",1402272000,8,635,4.521739130434782
6338123,5,B00J7YV09K,"George Arliss stars in a really wonderful movie I remember from my childhood when it was on TV! Many of his films have disappeared, so it's especially wonderful to see it back available again on DVD!

I hope they will release most of the rest of his films, all of which are of the highest quality!

It is a real treat to have another George Arliss film in my collection. A 1935 classic if there ever was one!",1400976000,4,408,4.217948717948718
6338124,5,B00J7YV09K,"George Arliss may be the only film star in history where it can said that his later films were better than his first ones, and the first films established his popularity and success. CARDINAL RICHELIEU turned out to be Mr. A's final American film and in many respects, it summarizes his appeal: witty, sly, and the master of the situation. Thereafter, he continued to star in films in his native Britain. He was one of the oldest actors to star in films and his appeal can be easily understood by watching any of his films today. Fox Home Video is to be commended for making this classic film available for the first time on DVD. Don't miss it!",1399075200,13,644,4.466101694915254
8648621,5,B00J7YV09K,"The George Arliss movie I would most have liked was ""Voltaire"": but this one is a doggone good runner-up. Arliss must have been one of the smoothest actors ever, near perfection in his inflection, modulation, total delivery of his lines ... he may have been more a ""personality"" than a ""character"" actor, but given the right parts, he was absolutely superb.
Plotwise, it would be very difficult for me to say who is actually supposed to be the villain and who the forces of righteousness. The two young lovers, yes, they are clearly good guys; but for Richelieu vs. his adversaries ... this is a play not of ""black and white,"" but of ""shades of gray,"" and on first viewing, I would have to say that the adversaries come off so much worse than the (in)famous cardinal as to put me shamelessly on his side. But I'm sure this is one of those movies I will want to watch fairly often. (Still looking out for ""Voltaire"" and ""The House of Rothschild."")",1513555200,,946,4.538011695906433
8648622,5,B00J7YV09K,"George Arliss wonderful as usual and a particularly interesting historic biography.
Of course, the intolerance of Richelieu towards the Huguenots is a disagreeable element.",1505433600,,172,6.208333333333333
8648623,5,B00J7YV09K,"George Arliss delivers his usual fabulous, magnetic presence as Cardinal Richelieu, the shadow behind the throne of King Louis XIII. As in Arliss' other movies, it's thrilling to watch him outfox his adversaries, whether it be the King's advisor, the Queen, or the feudal lords. I especially loved his first appearance in the King's bedroom when he simply stands there, silent and menacing. You can really believe Arliss is Richelieu, where his very name invokes terror in the hearts of people.

The film has a different tone than Alexandre Dumas' novel, TheThree Musketeers, a favorite of mine, but it's as fun to watch.",1497657600,,621,5.029126213592233

8648626,3,B00J7YV09K,"Cardinal Richelieu is a 1935 black and white historical drama from United Artists starring George Arliss.

George Arliss (1868-1946) plays Richelieu. He was a major star in the silent and the early talkie period, with films like Disraeli (1921 and 1929), Alexander Hamilton (1931), and Voltaire (1933). He won the Academy Award or Disraeli and was nominated again for The Green Goddess.

Maureen OSullivan (1911-1998) plays Lenore, Richelieus ward. She's most famous for playing Jane 6 times in the Tarzan films (1932-1942) but unlike Weissmuller, she played many other roles during that time, including Tugboat Annie (1933), The Thin Man (1934), A Day at the Races (1937), A Yank at Oxford (1938), and Pride and Prejudice (1940). She slowed down in the 40s to devote time to her husband and 7 children, one of whom is the actress Mia Farrow.

Edward Arnold (1890  1956) plays Louis XIII. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1916 to 1956. Hes best known for playing Daniel Webster in The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941) and Diamond Jim Brady in Diamond Jim. Hes one of the few hefty men who were ever able to achieve leading man status, but staying hefty (and not going to fat) was such a problem for him that he ultimately decided to let his girth expand while his stardom faded. This earned him many meaty character roles

Douglass Dumbrille (1889-1974) plays a villain (what else?). Dumbrille was in more than 200 films, and worked with the Marx Brothers (Day at the Races) as well as Abbott and Costello (foreign Legion) , the Bowery Boys (Spook Busters), the Ritz Brothers (The 3 Musketeers), and Bob Hope  (Son of Paleface), but he also did dramatic roles in films such as Virginia City (1940), Mr. Deeds Go to Town, and Julius Caesar (1953).

The film is directed by Rowland Lee (1891-1975) who specialized in costume dramas like The Three Musketeers (1935), The Son of Monte Cristo (1940) and Captain Kidd (1945).

Richelieu has been played by many actors, including Raymond Massey (Under the Red Robe, 1937), Vincent Price (The 3 Musketeers, 1948), Charlton Heston (The 3 Musketeers, 1973), Tim Curry (The 3 Musketeers, 1993), and Stephen Rea (The Musketeers, 2001). For my money, Arliss was the best.

The NY Times called it a stiff-jointed drama but praised Arliss work as well as Arnold and Dumbrille. Overall they dubbed it an enjoyable historical melodrama.

The film is a little stagey in the best sense of the 30s historical dramas, and the sets and costumes are great. Arliss, Arnold, Dumbrille, and OSullivan are at the top of their game. Dont let the camera work bore you and sit back and enjoy.",1431302400,,2618,4.823660714285714
8648627,5,B00J7YV09K,"George Arliss is at the center or every movie he's in.  He has his own classic theatrical style, which he translates beautifully to the screen, and a unique look which lends itself to angular or exotic faces, such as those of Mayer/Nathan Rothschild, Benjamin Disraeli, Voltaire and Cardinal Richelieu.  But Arliss can play generic elder types, too, like the father of Mary Astor or the love interest (yes!) of Bette Davis, whose career he fostered.

This is my second viewing of Richelieu since I bought the DVD.  As with other Arliss characters, I'm transfixed by his Richelieu.  Arliss has a way of being off-hand and diffident one moment and explosive the next.  He does this with Richelieu as he did with Rothschild and Disraeli, cowering his antagonists in a stroke.  He really eats up the scenery.  For me, the word to describe the experience of any George Arliss performance is ""delicious"".

By the way, I must disagree a little with another reviewer who depicts the plot as silly. I guess the confection of the romance between a young Cesar Romero and ingenue Maureen O'Sullivan adds frivolity to the mix, but there's real history here.  The plotting of the noble houses against the king was real in Louis XIII's time and would climax in the Fronde, the civil war in Louis XIV's time, which Richelieu was trying to avoid but his successor Cardinal Mazarin could not.  The centralization of political power was indeed a tidal force in French history, and it forms the basis of the plot here and the source of the high drama of which George Arliss is the master.",1429488000,,1569,4.752767527675276
8648628,5,B00J7YV09K,Cardinal Richelieu introduced me at a young age to historical dramas! The star George Arliss played a wide range of historical leaders from Alexander Hamilton to the likes of head of the house of Rothschild family! Yes when I was young TV was the center of family life in the 1950's! We got to see older movies from the 30's & 40's! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It's a great look at a slice of a long gone age of divine rule!,1417305600,,415,4.135802469135802
