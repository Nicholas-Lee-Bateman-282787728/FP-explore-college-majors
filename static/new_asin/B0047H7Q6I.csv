8418196,5,B0047H7Q6I,"The Jackie Robinson story is a sad story.  I think the whole attitude back then was wrong.  My heart was broken when I heard the news about Jackie's passing.  I was 19 years old at the time.  My Dad always talked very highly about Joe Louis.  We grew up in Little Italy in The Bronx, Joe Louis was long retired when I was 12 in 1965, Jackie Robinson retired when I was 3 in 1956.  I remember seeing TOPS Baseball cards with Jackie Robinson on them.  I wish I had one today!",1436400000,,473,4.076086956521739
