8469856,3,B005FC95FE,NOT WORTH THE $$$$$  I gave this a higher rating than I believe this DVD deserves bc she is cute & nice  There is also gratitude for her putting this video out with two hip replacement. She doesn't give enough hip opening. Which why I purchased it.  She does cross overs that my doctor doesn't recommend.  Nice to know some exercises can be done that aren't recognized as good for a mechanicsl hip. I worry of the joints coming apart. I think Jane Fonda is better & cheaper  Jane had a hip replacement & knee surgery as have I.,1475193600,2,527,4.282828282828283

8469858,5,B005FC95FE,"This set of Post rehab exercises was just what I was looking for! Being a year out from having bi-lateral total hip replacements I wanted to get moving again. Therapy was over but I felt very nervous about doing normal-jointed people exercises. I needed something to  address my specific condition. Maki herself has has bilateral hip replacement, which was a huge factor in my purchasing this product. I felt secure that she understood the needs and fears of starting an exercise program. I have felt great since beginning her program and feel like I am getting stronger every day. I haven't worked myself up to Volume 2 yet but I feel certain that when I do it will be just as beneficial. Maki: please come out with a Yoga video for post hip replacement and I will be your biggest fan!",1441238400,3,786,4.574468085106383
8469859,5,B005FC95FE,"I have not found anything like this. I had a hip replacement Oct 2013 and was still confused with what movements I can and cannot do. This is very encouraging too, to see that a hip replacement does not have to limit you as much as you may think. I would certainty recommend this and my orthopedic Dr. took down the link to it as well.",1396656000,5,335,4.090909090909091
