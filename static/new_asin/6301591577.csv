7813220,5,6301591577,"A Dangerous Life is an Australian film about the final years of the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos' rule, from the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1983 to the People Power EDSA Revolution in 1986 that ousted Marcos. It involves Tony O'Neil,an American TV journalist, on the scene when the tempestuous situation in Manila boils over. He puts his own life on the line to get the inside story of the overthrow of the Marcos regime. Also,he finds himself in the middle of key events that lead to the downfall of the Marcos regime.

The mini-series included Gary Busey and a cast of talented Filipino actors and actresses such as Ruben Rustia, Joonee Gamboa,Ray Ventura and Tessie Tomas,who had an impressive portrayal of Imelda Marcos.

Overall,it is an skillful recreation of a defining time in the history of the Philippines,a country who taught the world a lesson or two about democracy, the importance of unity and what it could achieve takes through non-violence - overthrowing the Marcos dictatorship - which makes them proud nation. Every Filipino would surely be proud of this achievement.",1440288000,,1105,5.032786885245901
7813221,5,6301591577,"I recently saw this movie 29 years after the People Power revolution in the Philippines that shook the world.  I was blown away by the acting, directorial job, superb screenwriting based on historical facts, cinematography, and total production work.  This movie clearly depicted what transpired during the uprising under the Marcos administration in 1986.  I highly recommend this movie for its historical value and the lessons it provide which is ""history repeats itself"".  The next question is , ""Did the people and leaders of the Philippines learn anything from these events and how is the economic and political situation right now? Did anything change?""",1437782400,,659,5.3076923076923075

7813223,5,6301591577,"I've loaned this VHS to several people who were in the Phillipines at the time of this historic event.  They say it is exactly what happened.  It shows the amazing success of a nonviolent movement for the common good and is one of the most inspiring movies of my lifetime.  Embedded in a romance, it would be classed as historical fiction.",1329264000,,339,4.524590163934426
7813224,4,6301591577,"Movie arrived in good condition. Ordering on Amazon is always easy. Story has personal meaning to my husband. Finally got it in our library. People give bad reviews about the acting, etc., but it was based on a documentary and wasn't meant to be an Academy award winner! It's just an important story about dictatorship and courage!",1328054400,,331,4.824561403508772
7813225,5,6301591577,"I saw ""It's a Dangerous Life"" when it first aired, too. It was a long film, but the intrigue and actual locations made it very interesting. The principle characters were simply outstanding. I was stationed at Clark Air Base from 1985 - 1990 and visited in 1991 just before Mt Pinatubo exploded and ended our long military presence in the P.I. I had several experiences surrounding the Revolution; including meeting the Marcos family when they flew up via helicopter to Clark and went to the 13th AF Medical Center. The President was very ill. I was called in by the Med Cntr Commander, Colonel John Hayden, to perform an exam on Marcos and evaluate his kidneys. Marcos was on dialysis and very weak. His wife and family were understandibly upset, but spent time gathering perfume and junk in our BX (which was opened just for them to get whatever they needed). I was surprised at their grabbing and filling shopping carts with things they couldn't take on the C-9 anyway. Col Hayden allowed the Marcos' to stay at his barn (house) that night and they flew out on the Nightingale (Hospital plane)the next morning. They went to Anderson AB (Guam) and Hickham (HI). I saw them on t.v. from Honolulu just before the President passed away.

The base blockade was very unpleasant and the strike to follow was even worse. I was shot at three times during my stay; including the day 5 Americans were murdered by the NPA. I was fortunate to receive a plaque from Cory at the Base NCO Club before I PCSed (relocated). In retrospect, I played a small part in the history of Clark and the Philippines. Experiencing history first-hand is always more interesting in hind-sight. During those events, it was exciting.. but very stressful. This film is very true to actual events. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in that period.",1287878400,2,1822,4.729559748427673
7813226,2,6301591577,"I was stationed in Subic bay philippines from 1984-1987. I was there during the gate strike. the skilled workers from Ship Repair Faciility blocked all the gates to the base. I had to have my wife and kids come on to the base so they could be safe. I worked port and starboard watches at port opreations subic bay meaning 12 on 12 off. I was there when the Commanding Officer naval station subic bay escorted mr. marcos to cubi naval air station to fly to hawaii. so to me this movie means a lot. 6 years later the base in subic was closed. it was unique to be there for a part of history. marcos was a mean man who did what he could to cheat at the elections. his wife as you will see in the movie had just as much power as he. I have been married to a filipina since 1981 for us this movie means a lot. we were a part of naval history.

7813227,4,6301591577,"I bought this tape because I had taped the first episode directly off HBO, way back when it aired on HBO.  But then I apparently forgot to get the rest of it.  When I went to view my old tape recently, I got quite interested in the story, but I only had the first (of 2 or 3) episodes originally aired.  So, I bought the Out Of Print (and thus quite expensive) VHS version of the tape on the used market.

The movie is good and the story is great, but they cut large amounts of the original broadcast out when they made the VHS tape.  One scene from the tape was Gary Busey being draggged out of his house by the Marcos cops.  But it was out of context, because they cut out a whole big scene showing the cops coming to the house and all the dialogue related to that.  So, in the tape, you see him being dragged out of the house, but you miss all the action that led up to it.

Another example was when Cory decides to run.  You see a scene with her saying she'll run, but you miss all the scenes showing people asking her over several periods if she'll run, and her saying she doesn't know.  Also cut was a scene with her confronting the guy who expected he'd be the one to run against Marcos.

Another scene missing from the tape was when Gary Busey first confronts his wife & her soldier friend at a bar.  They show a second encounter later in the movie, and there's even a comment there about ""no more shouting"", but you don't know what it means, because the scene it refers to has been cut.

All these cuts and more are just from the first episode, as aired, so of course I don't know what was cut from later episodes.  It's still a good movie, but quite disappointing regarding all the big cuts.",1096416000,5,1701,4.130699088145897
7813228,5,6301591577,"Marcos did not start off as a greedy, conniving politician. Somewhere along the way, his priorities changed and his vision was clouded with self-importance at the expense of the citizens he swore to protect and defend. Like many Asian leaders, he believed himself to invincible and he can do anything he wants and get away with it. A Dangerous Life, takes the audience to the events leading up to his deposal. The film gave an honest insight on the main characters of the Philippine politics, the deceptions, killing for gain and Cory's quest to avenge her people and her country. Gary Busey and the rest of the ensemble gave a superb performance. This film is worth keeping in anybody's collection.",999820800,4,699,4.833333333333333
