4908630,5,B005ZEU2SQ,"This is actually a made for television episode of ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983.  ""Run, Appaloosa, Run"", originally aired on the TV show in 1967 (season 14, episode 7) after serving as a theatrical featurette in July 29, 1966 along with the Main Feature at the time, ""Lt Robin Crusoe"". First release to video was in 1986. It's a story of Mary Blackfeather, a Native American girl of the Nez Pierce tribe who trains horses and performs as a trick rider. The Nez Perce are known for developing the spotted horses. Mary adopts a motherless colt that is rescued from a mountain lion by the family's herd dog ""Silver"", raises her and names her ""Holy Smoke"". Mary is eventually separated from her horse when she is forced to sell it at an auction to help her tribe raise money as horse sales are the basis of the tribe's economy in the film. The horse passes from one unworthy owner to another before he and Mary are reunited. They find each other again at a rodeo, and then land up joining in the historic annual ""Suicide Relay Race"", at Hells Mountain during the Omak Stampede. This is known as the roughest horse race in North America, dreamed up originally by the Nez Perce, consisting of a two horse per team relay of very rough terrain including jumping and swimming elements. Worse yet there are no rules and riders try to knock other riders off their horse. The herd dog ""Silver"" is amazing, and performs very well. This film is unique because it also features the famous rodeo clown Wilbur Plaugher playing himself, and many Native American actors. The movie was credited by Time Magazine at the time for a surge in popularity for Appaloosa horses. The Official Disney Encyclopedia Disney A to Z, on page 478 incorrectly lists the colt as ""Sky Dancer"", and in all fairness it is rare to see mistakes in that book.
The terrific cowboy singing and narration is by Rex Allen, and the title song he performs, ""Ballad of Appaloosa"" is written by Bobby Wayne. Fun and exciting adventure film for the whole family. Filmed in Technicolor and directed by Larry Lansburgh, who also wrote the original story, photographed and produced the film. Lansburgh had a long career of making Disney animal featurettes from the 1940's. Later he wrote and produced, a terrific theatrical feature film for Disney, ""the Littlest Outlaw"". I recommend this for horse lovers, and fans of old Disney television.",1385337600,3,2451,4.7266355140186915

4908637,5,B005ZEU2SQ,"I had never expected to find this movie again; it had been YEARS since I had last seen it. I remembered it from my childhood, and ""Run, Appaloosa, Run"" has always been one of my very favorite Disney horse movies.  I was thrilled to find it available on DVD.  The quality of picture and sound is excellent, and it was just as I remembered--the story was not edited in any way.  The opening and closing song ""Appaloosa"", sung by Western star Rex Allen, is catchy and memorable.  The story of a Nez Perce Indian woman who raises, trains, and then has to sell her beloved Appaloosa horse and finally gets him back in an unexpected way, is very heart-warming.  A great family movie.",1345680000,30,677,4.471544715447155

4908765,4,B005ZEU2SQ,"Movie itself is only about a 3-star. The reason I bumped it up is that my mother, who is a horse fanatic and has been since she was a little girl, has been searching for this movie for years and been unable to track down an inexpensive VHS or DVD, which are quite hard to come by these days. Having this for streaming on Amazon Instant Video proves the value of digital streaming for all movie content - sometimes there just aren't enough physical copies in the world of a movie for everyone who wants to see something to do so. That alone is worth a star.

The film itself was made for TV's the Wonderful World of Disney but also played in some theatrical venues, per other reviewers' firsthand experience. The story plays out pretty predictably. One could argue that there's not enough character development and fault the 50 minute TV runtime as leaving less time for a better story. I don't think the runtime is an issue, the problem is with focus. The film burns a lot of time with narration moving the story along instead of the characters themselves, and then occasionally slows down and almost dips into being a documentary in places, especially when real-life rodeo clown Wilbur Plaugher shows up, plus the fact that the ""Suicide Run"" is a real race that takes place regularly in Omak, Washington. Later I researched and found out that director/writer Larry Lansburgh had earlier won an Oscar for Best Documentary for The Horse with the Flying Tail. In retrospect this makes some of the creative choices more obvious. I think if this story were remade today, feature length, there's a compelling story buried in here that Disney could do a good job with. After all, how many movies feature a young Native female protagonist? There's something there and I'll give it credit for putting a character like that out thereThe actors all turn in fair-for-the-time performances. No one's reaching for Oscars on Wonderful World of Disney, but it is a Disney movie and it functions.

But I'm not really in the key demographic. My mom, the horse nut, adores cute animals doing tricks, her favorite horse breed is the appaloosa, she loves simple stories where the underdog comes out on top and there's a happy ending... and therefore she pretty much loved this movie. Horse movies tend to be made for horse lovers, and this movie shines for them.",1426896000,3,2342,4.709756097560976

4908767,5,B005ZEU2SQ,"One of my favorite Disney horse movies.  I'm sure our Native friends might disagree, but even the treatment of the Native Americans was quite respectful, given the era this was filmed.  Beautiful horsemanship and riding in the movie, too.  If you love horses, you'll enjoy this.  (Second only to Horse with the Flying Tail!)",1415491200,,324,4.944444444444445
