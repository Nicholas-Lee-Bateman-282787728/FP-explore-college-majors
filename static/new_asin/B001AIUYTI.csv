8277759,4,B001AIUYTI,"Although intended for a niche audience, this documentary is very well produced. If you are interested in horses, ranching and the singular men who continue to embrace and excel in the vanishing vocation of horsemanship, then you will be compelled to enjoy sharing a little time with these Northern regional cowboys, learning about their unique tack and lives.  The original songs are also a bonus.
My wife and I will be looking into more offerings in this extensive series on Vaqueros from around America. Well done!",1526860800,,516,5.0
