REVENGE (season 1) 10/2/55 (series premier)- also on the season 1 set.

BREAKDOWN (season 1) 11/13/55 - also on the season 1 set.

WET SATURDAY (season 2) 9/30/56 - also on the season 2 set.

MR. BLANCHARD'S SECRET (season 2) - also on the season 2 set.

I would strongly suggest buying the seasonal sets if you are a fan:

8030818,5,B0002RPIOE,"I never saw this series when it first aired on network television. I saw the reruns on Nick at Nite and enjoyed them very much, and I also enjoyed the ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS COMPANION I purchased off Amazon.com which documents the entire series (recommended). I have since purchased numerous episodes of this series on DVD and this one is no exception. The picture and sound quality is superb. Wet Saturday is based on the John Collier short story and was well-acted by Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Though certainly not the best episodes of the series, these come recommended.",1111190400,5,572,4.907216494845361
