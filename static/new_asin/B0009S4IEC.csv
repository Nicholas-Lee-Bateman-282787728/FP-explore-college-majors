8065903,5,B0009S4IEC,"First of all this is NOT a Jews for Jesus film - neither Jew nor Christian will be offended by anything in this film. The only group which would be offended would be Muslims (but then again what aren't they offended by).
  If you are interested in the future of Israel and of that of the Jewish people; you will find this DVD `very' interesting. Both Jew (Simcha Jacobovici; the director is Jewish) and Christian can see the evidence of `possible' prophecy being fulfilled in our lifetime; that is `if' what Mr. Jacobovici says is true. Even the state of Israel believes that some of the lost tribes (the most famous of that being Dan - found in of all places Uganda) having already come back; Also Manasseh came back in 2007 (being found in of all places (northeast India).
 Jacobovici travels to many remote areas to search for missing links to the 10 Lost Tribes - if nothing else this is a good travel log film. As for me (I'm an evangelical Christian) I think Mr. Jacobovici's hypothesis is fairly solid although not as of yet proven. To bad that Mr. Jacobovici lent his name to the ""Tomb of Jesus"" debacle - which at best is a theory with even less evidence to back it up than the ""Quest for the ten lost tribes.""",1183766400,2,1219,4.408888888888889
8065904,5,B0009S4IEC,"This Movie WAS Awesome! It is not a ""Jews for Jesus"" in any manor! It is just an intriguing ""View"" of the Lost Tribes. Filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici is brilliant in this and the ""The Exodus Decoded""! I have not seen his other movies and can't comment on them.",1169510400,5,257,4.375
8065905,1,B0009S4IEC,"The DVD will not play. It was not ""programmed"" properly and will not play on any of the two DVD players I own or my computer. Another warning, even though this program was produced by A&E and the CBC, it was released to DVD by ""Jewish Quest Ministries"" This organization is a""jews for jesus"" type group. Since most Jews find prostelizing offensive be advised that buying this DVD will financially support these people.",1123459200,2,418,4.739726027397261
