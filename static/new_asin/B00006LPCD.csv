1784918,2,B00006LPCD,BORING AND SLOW !!!!!!! NOT A CLASS MOVIE LIKE BAKER DID LATER IN THE SIXTIES IN THE FAMOUS FILM ZULU,1389571200,,101,4.1
1784919,5,B00006LPCD,"This is the best prison movie I've ever seen.  Stanley Baker is at his best as Johnny Bannion, the leader of  cell block B, who gets out,does a heist, and goes back in. Murray Melvin is in stir, probably representing a gay british convict  of the 1950s, a time when it was common in Britain to be gay and incarcerated. Patrick Magee, known most often for his weird role in A Clockwork orange, is magnificent as the head warder. There is much good acting. Some of it takes place on the outside. Nigel Green of The Ipcress File is a crude thug. Sam Wannamaker is very creepy as a modern member of organized crime, who I think is meant to be gay and sort of after Stanley Baker. It's hard to tell because of the censorship limitations of the time in Britain, which limitations actually caused more subtle depictions. A young lady named Margit Saad does a very good turn as  Stanley Baker's new girlfriend on the outside. Brian Phelan is magnificent as Paulie, a very intelligent and sensitive mentally disturbed inmate. The fellow who played the big boned country boy worrying about the calf in Zulu is excellent as a young irish convict. There are many familiar faces.",1387584000,2,1166,4.564593301435407
1784920,5,B00006LPCD,"Ground breaking. Flounts the movie codes of it's day. The female nudity was surprising. Showed that british  prisons weren't like BIG HOUSE USA.But still a place that dangerous people needed to be. Stanley Baker turned a performance
equal to the one he did a few years later in the Great Train Robbery. Sam
Wanamaker was perfect as the double crossing henchman as was Nigel Greene.
Even though the robbery wasn't shown till end of the deed. A pretty good caper
movie. The relationship with the girl was mature-adult.",1361836800,,516,4.863636363636363
1784921,5,B00006LPCD,"The Criminal is the first of the numerous masterpieces Joseph Losey directed in the 60's.

Yes, The Criminal is Brechtian with its way to avoid emotions and handle violence with a distant caution, Yes, The Criminal is Kafkaan in the way Losey describes Stanley Baker's luxurious apartment that finally isn't so different than Baker's cell and yes The Criminal is openly the work of a left-wing director who assimilates the prison's structure as the organs of a public company. The result is a formidable British film noir. Indispensable.",1333584000,3,852,6.2905982905982905
1784922,5,B00006LPCD,"""Brute Force"",""Caged"", are my favorite prison pictures, this one comes in third for me. Baker(1928-76) is one of my favorites. I dig the prison uniforms, they look better than civilian clothes. It's a story about a criminal that can't stay out of prison. Noirish. Baker's acting never disappoints.",1262736000,6,297,5.208333333333333
1784923,5,B00006LPCD,"The Criminal (aka The Concrete Jungle) is, for my money at least, one of Joseph Losey's two best films (the other being King and Country), but it never really garnered the kind of success or reputation it deserved, possibly because it had the misfortune to open on the same day as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, which completely overshadowed it. Billed as `the most violent film ever made in Britain,' even 45 years on it's still vicious stuff. Indeed, in the entire cast of characters that populate Alun Owen's excellent and unsentimental screenplay - irredeemable crooks, vicious prison warders, prison governors who don't really want to know, amoral molls and assorted perverts and thugs - the only two people in the entire film who aren't totally corrupt are Laurence Naismith's arresting officer (who is still not above letting on about his informants) and the piano tuner who appears in one brief scene. The plot is a simple enough variation on Touchez Pas au Grisbi, with Stanley Baker's con pulling off a big job and immediately being ratted out by one of his partners who wants a bigger share, but the stark execution and background is what carries it. Certainly its vision of the British prison system as a Hellish melting pot of refuse of all persuasions - Irish, Australian, Italians, West Indians, the mentally disturbed - where the guards don't only turn a blind eye to vicious beatings but even facilitate them is a kick in the groin to the more sedate cop movies of the day.

It's also full of memorable little moments, from the prison weasel spreading the news of an informant's return inbetween lines of Knick Knack Paddywhack to Kenneth J. Warren's inability to say anything without incorporating the word `loike.' Robert Krasker's black and white cinematography has more bite to it than most of its contemporaries, from the hard stark edges of the prison scenes to the bleak half-snowscape of the haunting final shots, while Johnny Dankworth's score makes great use of Cleo Laine's mournful prison balled (""All my loving, all my joy/Came from loving a thieving boy""]). The supporting cast is impressive, offering a virtual who's who of perfectly cast 60s British character actors, including many faces that would later memorably turn up among the ranks in Baker's Zulu). Unlike the wave of British gangster flicks to litter the straight-to-video shelves post-Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this feels like the real thing rather than a bunch of nicely brought up middle class kids playing dress-up. For some curious reason Anchor Bay's otherwise excellent transfer omits the end credits, played over a melancholy shot of prisoners walking in circles in a stark and wintery exercise yard.",1131840000,13,2716,5.022172949002218
1784924,5,B00006LPCD,"This film has seemingly been forgotten, it's not usually mentioned in the pantheon of 'great' british gangster films or even the best work of it's director.
often called a 'realistic' film it's more an expressionist handling (minus the shadowy lighting of hollywood film noirs) of typical material, this makes it a bit of a shock on first viewing and might explain why it isn't as highly regarded as it ought to be.  It's setting is a cold, snowy winter in london, there is no night time neon city lighting, the action outside prison takes place almost entirely during the day or indoors when darkness falls. It is also a quiet film (except of course when the violence and the screaming erupt), that added to the setting and the stark photography create a very a alien world in which the central character just doesn't belong.
Johnny Bannion (Stanley Baker) reminds me of Pacino's Tony Montana in 'Scarface' (however unlike pacino in that film Baker's stature isn't symbolic of his impotent rage given his heavy build and large frame), he's an irish hoodlum who has risen fairly high but doesn't have what it takes to get to the very top. In Tony's case he isn't ruthless enough and is guarenteed to fall as quickly as he rose due to his own weaknesses. Likewise Bannion is guarenteed to fall, he's a hard nut capable of taking anyone on but he just doesn't belong with the morons and treacherous schemers in his line of work. His appartment is decorated with modern art, it's implied he has a gift for maths and he doesn't really seem at home at a party his fellow mobsters throw for him. He's impatient with everyone, when he erupts in anger it is tinged with petulant sorrow (Baker's thuggish profile and stoic hardness belies  a feral, anxious, wounded yet restrained performance), so much so that it arouses contempt in his gangster friends who comment behind his back. When he rebukes Sam Wannamaker's character repeatedly he seems a frustrated child, frustrated at both the life he leads and having to associate and rely on characters such as this. He is totally unaware that wannamaker's sly smile and constant glances betray a man itching to usurp him.  And like in Scarface, where Montana can never be his boss Sosa, Bannion just isn't as ruthless as his underlings or his superiors, they're big time, he's small time. His being able to beat two men senseless in his prison cell is nothing compared to the cold hearted deviousness and ambition of his lieutenant who does not have his strength or capacity for physical violence. Both Tony and Johnny possess a dubious sense of honour that those around them do not, in both films there is no honour among thieves and they fail to grasp and adhere to that. Neither of them can accept the system around them. In Tony's case he's endlessly railing against capitalism, in Bannion's he is unable to hide his dismay and anger at the actions of the selfish, corrupt, manipulative and sadistic head warder, something i can't imagine would ever bother the other crime bosses in the film. But then the warder would never dream of moving against them because he can tell the difference between those with real power and those without, even if they are at similar levels in the hierarchy
In 'The Criminal' all this is subtlely conveyed despite and because of what would seem outlandish and anachronistic direction for a crime drama made in the second half of the 1960s.
Losey's way of impressing this man's alienation on us are brilliant, the film has a dreamy quality due to the snowy landscapes and the way he incorporates almost expressionist techniques and performances in his film without it destroying it's hard nosed feel. The insane scottish inmate played by Tom Bell has a tortured monologue where the the prison around him goes black and in close up he explains why he is different to those around him. The camera pulls back and light returns to reveal that Bannion, to whom he is supposedly talking is not listening.
When Bannion falls he falls hard, the cell block he commands turn against him having been fooled into thinking he is an informer (although this is also a part of bannion's scheme to escape and unfortunately his 'friends' scheme to kill him).  The grass/snitch/tout he has beaten by a crony in the opening of the film even gets to turn the tables on him.  The prison sections at the beginning and end seem to me a forerunner of Alan Clarke's 'Scum'.  Patrick Magee (in a non horror role for once) is very much a hysterical yet melifuous 60s predecessor of the warders in that film.
A word must go to the music, that adds to the chilly wintry feeling, so quiet a film that when the light jazzy score by John Dankworth plays seemingly inappropriately it adds to the overall effect. The prison ballad sung by Cleo Laine over the title credits is haunting, never has a song seemed so apt at the start of a film. It is a promise of a unique experience, a promise that the film then makes good, i can't quite think of another like it.  Losey's greatest achievement on screen, so different to the hollow, stylistically flat and totally stereotypical English rubbish he is perhaps best known for (although his curio for Hammer studios 'These are the Damned' is excellent too, if uneven).  It goes beyond the smart little film noirs he made in Hollywood like 'the Prowler'.
'Get Carter' and 'The Long Good Friday' seem to be the benchmark of British organised crime movies these days, a major difference between them and 'the Criminal' is that it is a great film. It's different, but it rewards in bleakness, nuance and brutality.
