8529790,4,B008QRW38G,"An orbiting satellite goes through THE FLAME BARRIER, causing it to crash in the dense jungles of Mexico. Meanwhile, Carol Dahlmann (Kathleen Crowley- TARGET EARTH) hires Dave Hollister (Arthur Franz- INVADERS FROM MARS, MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS, THE ATOMIC SUBMARINE) and his brother to help her find her lost husband. She fears for him, since he's gone in search of the missing satellite. The trio set out on their trek, encountering many perils along the way, including wildlife, such as Mexican monkeys (?!) and hyenas (??!!).

More be-wigged, Hollywood Indians appear, just in time to be enlisted as baggage-carriers! Amazingly, Mrs. Dahlmann's hair remains full and manageable, in spite of the jungle heat! Hey, wasn't there a satellite out here somewhere? And what about the Hollywood Indians that keep melting to death? Romance blooms, so I guess Mrs. D's forgotten all about her husband! Oh look! A chimpanzee! THE FLAME BARRIER is a typical jungle adventure, disguised as a sci-fi epic.
