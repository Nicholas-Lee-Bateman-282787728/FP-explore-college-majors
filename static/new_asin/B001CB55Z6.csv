8286387,1,B001CB55Z6,I bought this DVD for my daughter (10 years old) who is tennis mad. Neither of us found it funny and I don't really think it was that helpful either. Quite simply: we don't watch it!,1283558400,,182,4.083333333333333
8286388,1,B001CB55Z6,"This is the first time I am feeling so disappointed in spending money on an educational DVD. I have used and worked with James Jenson tennis educational video. It has taken me deeper into tennis but sometimes I felt the details were too much to understand. That is the reason I brought this DVD - ""tennis taught in a fun way"" as they proclaimed.

I started playing the DVD and I was sitting on my couch looking like a stupid in front of my wife. A bunch of old characters standing in front of the camera for the first time in life - reading stuff from the tele-prompter. The script is intended to make you smile and it ended up making me fume. How will you feel if your toddler reads a joke to you just like his bed time story while he is sleepy. It gave me the similar effect.

The first part they show a recording of a ladies double match and that is the only time I saw some good tennis. The grips part was almost digest-able.

The only good thing about the DVD is small pieces of advice snippets (2-3 minutes long) from some USTPA approved trainers - and they were around 5 of them. Total at-least useful time for this DVD is 15-25 minutes of these small snippets. The rest of this DVD is cheap acting skills by first time actors with very low tennis experience for an educational video like this.

I saw three 5 stars in amazon for this product and hence bought it. After seeing the DVD I went back and looked at them. They all are from Arizona. Hmmm.. I wonder.

Bottom-line: Please don't waste your money if you have played or know little tennis.",1252627200,,1553,4.2687074829931975

No useful content, can't point to one highlight. Can't imagine who would find this useful. Don't waste your money.",1250640000,,265,4.541666666666667
8286390,5,B001CB55Z6,"Love-15-30-40 is one of the most well-written and wonderfully produced comedy instructional sports videos I have seen! As an avid tennis player, I was looking for a product that would not only improve my tennis game, but would also keep me engaged and would be memorable. This video has it all! I would recommend buying it not only for yourself, but for any beginner, intermediate or advanced tennis players that you might know! It's a video that you can truly watch over and over without getting bored. It offers wonderful tips and strategies that you really will take with you to the court to become a much stronger tennis player.

Most instructional videos I have seen cannot keep my attention for very long. Love-15-30-40 has so many comedic elements intertwined throughout the instructional portions of the video that it truly is entertaining! I highly recommend this video to any tennis player out there, or just anyone who wants to learn a little bit more about the game!",1236643200,,978,4.8562874251497
8286391,5,B001CB55Z6,What a fun way to get serious information across to once-serious tennis players. Creative. Goofy. Imaginative. I like Professor Racquet's TJ (Tennis Jargon) section the best!,1218931200,,174,5.730769230769231
8286392,5,B001CB55Z6,"I have not played tennis in years and this was a great, fun DVD to watch and get some wonderful tips for the game.  I can't wait to get back out and play!!",1217721600,,155,3.696969696969697
