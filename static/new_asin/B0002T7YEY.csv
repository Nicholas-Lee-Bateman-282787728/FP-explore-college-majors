2118471,5,B0002T7YEY,I went to see this movie as I like action movies and I have to say it was pretty decent.  It had some twists and turns and was not predictable.  I would see it again.,1317081600,,166,3.7142857142857144
2118472,3,B0002T7YEY,"I just got home from seeing Abduction, and was pleasantly surprised that it was not as bad as the reviews it has received.  Some that I read are scathing. My take on the movie follows:

DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.......

Spoilers ahead!

The Good:  Taylor Lautner did not deserve a lot of the criticism he received with regard to his acting ability.  He was not given a lot to work with in this movie with the exception of some good fight scenes and stunts. Both showcased his martial arts and overall athletic ability. I was impressed. When he did get some decent lines, I believe he did a very good job with them.  I liked his scenes with his CIA parents, especially when the truth came out about his identity. He was not ""wooden"" as one reviewer suggested. Lautner is able to make you care about what happens to his character.  He did this in all three Twilight movies, and, again, here. I felt his pain in losing the only parents he ever had moments after finding out they weren't really his.  I thought he handled that scene with his CIA mother very well.  From what I've seen, he commits 100% to the task at hand. I also liked how Nathan heard his CIA Dad's instructions in his head while taking down the big goon that attacks him and Karen (Lilly Collins) on the train. Nice touch.  The end, too, was satisfying.  Nathan's biological father saving him may have been predictable, but I enjoyed it all the same.  I was glad, too, that his Dad provided someone to take care of him.  Who better than his psychiatrist. Sigourney Weaver is believable in any role she takes on.  She is a very gifted actress.

The Bad:  I did not see much chemistry between him and Lilly Collins.  I think she did a decent job with her lines, but at times she seemed disconnected from her character and Nathan.  Again, I just didn't feel the love even in their love scene. It did not sizzle.  The plot was uneven and difficult to follow at times.  Everyone seemed to be a bad guy.

The Ugly:  There wasn't much.  I did, however, find many lines in the movie  to be a bit cheesy, and I still am trying to figure out how a gun would get past security at a major league ball game.  The CIA came across as pretty inept. It was also hard watching Nathan and his CIA dad in what seemed like mortal combat. Later, on, though it was explained why this was necessary. Finally, I wished we could have seen more of the actor that played Nathan's father...although I think it may have been Dermot Mulroney.  He has that scar above his lip.

Taking all of the above into account, I would recommend the movie for those who like action flicks and Taylor Lautner.  I still think he is going to be the breakout star out of the three in the Twilight series.  He has a great screen presence and is working hard at honing his craft. One more thing...He isn't hard on the eyes either.",1317081600,,2862,4.3352165725047085
2118473,3,B0002T7YEY,"The Secret KGB UFO Files (Disc 1) features some interesting aerial filming of two objects merging together, another object descending into the clouds while flying parallel to a fighter jet, and a cylinder accelerating away from jet pursuit.  Disc 1 also shows films of the Tunguska devastation in 1908, many aerial interception explosions, and archival Soviet Union political events.  I especially liked the transition segment showing a sleek-looking Russian tank rolling fluidly down a snow-banked road.  The second half of Disc 1 focuses on analysis of two acquired films and trying to understand what they represent without a definite determination.  In the filmed acquiring of supposed KGB documents related to UFOs, it was somewhat humorous seeing the mean-looking Russian businessman say the price for the documents had suddenly gone up because of how dangerous it was to get them.

Other reviewers have said there is no value to Disc 2, and in watching it, I saw why they had this view.",1270684800,,993,5.142857142857143

This is a shocking History based in real Facts taken place during the KGB period & cold world war. What I enyoy must is the final abduction who taken place in Egypt and the deep studies of this old civilization who constructed piramids in perfect alignment with the stars for teletransportation to other worlds...

This type of commercial release must be at least partially supported by the current Bush administration due to its obsession with wild fabrication and disinformation. Through mainstream marketing, this DVD perpetuates the government controlled media-propagated derision of those who study the UFO phenomenon along the same lines as ridiculing those who believe the 9/11 Commission and do not accept the ongoing lies put forth for the Iraq invasion.",1102204800,5,631,5.32

2118583,4,B0002T7YEY,I wanted to see Taylor's hot bod. Does he give an Oscar winning performance? No. Is the story a little weird and hard to follow? Yes. Is this a good movie to watch while bored on a Sunday afternoon and tired of cable TV reruns? Sure. Overall I'm giving this movie 4 stars because it is exactly what I wanted it to be; a movie where a hot lead actor takes his shirt off within the first 30 minutes. The fight scenes were fun to watch and overall I enjoyed the acting. My biggest gripe is that the plot wasn't cohesive. It seemed to start out being a suspense drama with a dash of action to an action movie with laughable drama without explaining why.,1466553600,2,649,4.2

2118665,2,B0002T7YEY,Too much footage cut from the original. Viewer is short changed out of the what the film makers intended.

2118674,5,B0002T7YEY,"Got hooked on Taylor Lautner from the Twilight saga so I figured I'd purchase this movie to check him out as a totally different character.  I wasn't disappointed.  Considering he was only 18 years old when they filmed this, I thought he was awesome, especially since he did most of his own stunts.  I was totally impressed.  I thought he did great as a leading man.  I think in the years ahead we will see lots more of him on the BIG screen.  Can't wait to see him in ""Tracers"", out this weekend.  Hoping to see it while on spring break.",1426636800,,538,4.267326732673268

2118676,2,B0002T7YEY,"Firmly in the so-bad-its-good category, this is Taylor Lautner's desperate attempt to be taken seriously outside of Twilight. The plot revolves around Taylor's character Nathan discovering that his guardians might not be his birth parents, a revelation that is more dramatic on a Lifetime/Hallmark level than an action movie one. The incident that's REALLY inciting, though is that he enquires about a child that looks to be his younger self on a missing child website that turns out to be the most overblown phishing scam ever conceivedlaid out so that Russian spies could track Nathan down and...ABDUCT him! They...don't, though. He escapes along with his vapid, girl-next-door love interest, Karen. From there, a few more characters join the chase, most bafflingly Sigourney Weaver, who had been Nathan's therapist. The rest is textbook cat-and-mousing, accompanied by an action theme that is about two bars long, and punctuated by a series of convenient incompetencies.

In addition to Sigourney Weaver, they also got Alfred Molina for their suspicious FBI/CIA/Whatever Agent, and the talented Maria Bello and Jason Isaacs as Nathan's parents; all of which seems to suggest that ""Abduction"" was their primary method of casting. ...Because, again, at no point in the movie is anyone abducted. Anyhow, for an ultimately pretty by-the-numbers teen thriller, it makes enough bizarre decisions and its overblown drama fits so poorly on its young stars and PG-13 target, it manages to be consistently entertaining as a bad movie.",1426464000,,1527,5.3625

2118684,3,B0002T7YEY,"As my lady friend and I are seniors, we knew nothing about this film going in.  I thought this was going to be like the TV film ""The Kissing Place"",
which starred Meredith Baxter from Family Ties, about a kid who discovers he was kidnapped.  Instead, what we got was more like a lightweight
Bourne Identity type film, with action galore, and the characters always miles ahead of the audience.  I forgot Taylor Lautner was the star of the
""Twilight"" films, only one of which I suffered through.  My opinion of this is in between most of the loved it or hated it reviews.  It was okay and held
my interest, but it lacked any genuine emotion.  If you are in the mood for mindless action and fighting, and want a movie rather than a ""film"", I guess you could do worse than this.  My lady friend liked this more than I did and would probably give it 4 stars, but she is not looking for more than a
couple of hours entertainment.  I can watch a great film tens of times.  She, except for ""The Sound of Music"", once or twice.  This one will definitely
be a one-timer for me.",1423872000,,1067,4.263681592039801

2118689,4,B0002T7YEY,"i came across this blu ray the other day while i was helping my mother move in to her new home. I tell her i KNOW why this is here. You women love this guy (thanks to the wolf man, HA!). No i'm not a typical fan of this guy myself. He was ok in Twilight. It's just that for most men he is a little annoying to look at for a long period of time..... like watching too much Spongebob, RIGHT!!? Anyways, this is ACTUALLY an overall solid movie [for you women reading, I PROMISE THERE WAS NO PUN INTENDED]! In the beginning was some very good acting. There was also a deep script to ACT to. Taylor Lautner, i believe, has opened doors to a new genre. Haters just accept it, he may be the next action hero! I don't think he will reach Bond status, but he can definitely play an entertaining role. While it was an entertaining thrill-ride, i tend to think that Taylor still has some evolving to do on camera. He just maybe depending on his looks to much. And i can honestly say that there is not one PRETTY-BOY located in my favorite A-Team action movie collection. On the blu-ray, however Taylor IS on the special features extensively, so i have a new respect for him in that department. I hardly ever see detailed interviews with the stars of hollywood. So if you are a TRU fan of Taylor Lautner, you will want this blu ray in your collection. It IS worth the price that Amazon is asking.",1422835200,,1384,4.226415094339623

2118767,4,B0002T7YEY,The movie kept us guessing which is always good. Great special effects. Cheesy love scene but overall it was entertaining.,1393459200,,122,5.15
2118768,3,B0002T7YEY,"A fun flick. Great flick if you are a Taylor Lautner fan ;)

I was happily surprised to see it was set in Pittsburgh, my home town. If you are a Burgh Baby and you miss home this is a good choice for you!",1393459200,,204,3.6363636363636362
2118769,3,B0002T7YEY,I liked the theme of the story and the actors and actresses in it. The location of the movie was scenic.,1393372800,,104,4.0

2118775,3,B0002T7YEY,"This movie isn't as bad as you have heard.
Taylor Lautner is no Lawrence Olivier, but give the kid a break.  He will develop into a solid action star.

You don't rent this kind of movie to expect oscar caliber performances. None of the traditional action stars are particularly skilled actors. They are personalities. They provide entertainment not cultural enrichment.

This movie is entertaining.  The action scenes are well done. The production values throughout are high.

Go ahead, watch the movie....you will be glad you did.",1393286400,,531,5.127906976744186

2118778,5,B0002T7YEY,This movie keeps you wondering what will happen next. Had some good action but nothing too gory or violent !,1393200000,,108,4.45
2118779,5,B0002T7YEY,"Loved the action in this movie. It was a fun movie, while keeping your attention with suspense and action. Taylor actually looks physically fit enough to make his character believable.",1393113600,,184,5.166666666666667
2118780,4,B0002T7YEY,"I like Sigourney Weaver & Jason Isaacs, I wish they had had more screen time.  Taylor & Lily did an okay job; I thought Lily did an excellent job showing a shell-shocked person after witnessing the murders.  The action was pretty good, and I loved Taylor's various fight scenes.  They were all the more impressive to me, after I read about his martial arts training - his kicks were awesome to watch.

The story moved somewhat slowly, but once we got into action scenes, it began to move better.  When Taylor had a couple of shirtless scenes I had to chuckle, as the Americanized voice of Rob Pattinson dryly questioned in my mind, ""Doesn't he own a shirt?""  Hence, my Team Jacob title for this post.

Was the movie great?  No, not really.  Was the movie a total waste, as some have said?  Not by a long shot.  This movie will never be considered a classic, but the action/fight scenes made it definitely worth a watch.  Some said Lily & Taylor had no chemistry, I thought they looked like two teens who had grown up together and were tentatively taking a chance on the childhood friendship blossoming into a love interest.  So yeah, I thought they looked quite well together, the first couple of kisses and touches were tentative - which is believable for those just crossing over from friendship to romance.",1393027200,,1309,4.5905172413793105

It is stays very clean compared to some other movies which I appreciate.  Other than making out, it doesn't have much sexual content.  I didn't have any reactions to cursing in the movie.  There is probably some in there somewhere, but it wasn't enough to bother me which says something good.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",1393027200,,440,4.178571428571429

Either way after a while I finally clicked on it, it wasn't bad. I like the fact it does have action in the movie he does have a romantic interest yet it wasn't anything  near pornographic so I wouldn't mind watching this with someone as young 13 years old.",1393027200,,424,4.3
2118783,4,B0002T7YEY,It was a surprise all the way through it. Good action- enjoyable to watch . Good flick - nice to see hero in making,1392940800,,115,3.8333333333333335
2118784,5,B0002T7YEY,Will keep you guessing. Lots of exciting scenes. Great acting and good plot. The story was very believable and definitely held your in suspense. I would recommend watching this movie.,1392854400,,183,5.133333333333334
2118785,3,B0002T7YEY,"The plot and premise that abduction has are great! That being said, the movie lacks vision of where it wanted to go. Another thing that I did not care for was the idiotic looking bad guys ""villains"" in the film, they simply didn't cut it.",1392854400,,238,4.311111111111111
2118786,3,B0002T7YEY,My husband let me do the choosing so I picked this one.  I knew I liked Taylor and didn't want to surf around all night.  I stayed awake - a miracle in itself - and when it was over my husband said I made a good pick.  High praise from him.,1392854400,,240,3.6666666666666665

2118792,3,B0002T7YEY,Not a bad movie to watch on a snowy day and no football or golf.  First movie I've watched with Lautner in it.....guess he's an okay actor....I would give him B-.,1392595200,,162,4.225806451612903

2118794,3,B0002T7YEY,"I'm not sure what I expected.  Lots of action without a doubt but no real depth of story.  The non stop action is good, but it seems the fights could have been choreographed a bit better.",1392508800,,187,4.166666666666667
2118795,3,B0002T7YEY,"It wasn't as bad as some of the reviews here. I thought Taylor did a good job in the movie. It was entertaining, the plot picked up very quickly and melded with the story background built in laymans terms.",1392508800,,205,4.282051282051282

2118797,3,B0002T7YEY,"My 2 cents worth shouldn't count at all.  OK, it doesn't.  I'm well-outside the target demo for this film.  This is the 1st film I've seen Mr. Lautner in.  Gives a capable, competent performance in a film aimed squarely at the multiplex crowd familiar with his work in  the ""Twilight"" series.  Leading lass,  capable as well.  Nice turn by Maria Bello as his Mom. (Notice how I didn't use quotation marks...?)

By Friday night, I want something  fun and unchallenging, and this was it.  Sort of a  ""Bourne - lite"", if you will.  But on the good side, I didn't have high expectations anyway, and  Lautner manages to surpass whatever expectations I had going in.....",1392422400,,664,4.660869565217391
2118798,1,B0002T7YEY,poor acting and too slow pace. Actors are just appearing to just be going 'through the moves'. I do not recommend this movie. I couldn't even finish it because it was so slow.,1392422400,,175,4.333333333333333
2118799,4,B0002T7YEY,I thought it had a lot of action and suspense. It was a very good movie. I would recommend it.,1392422400,,94,3.75
2118800,5,B0002T7YEY,My husband and I watched Abduction and didn't expect what we saw.  Very good movie.  I had no idea what the movie was about before watching but I can tell you it is a good one.  I do recommend it for older teens and adults.  Probably a bit frightening for younger children.,1392422400,,273,4.1923076923076925
2118801,4,B0002T7YEY,Good action and suspense.  Lautner did a fine job of acting and making it seem possible.  Too bad he couldn't meet his dad.,1392422400,,123,4.304347826086956
2118802,4,B0002T7YEY,Good action movie. The story is so so. But it was executed well. The bad guy was really really scary.,1392422400,,101,4.1

2118804,5,B0002T7YEY,A guide to a current issue plaguing the world and how to prevent it. Very suitable for policy makers and community safety net workers.,1392336000,,134,4.625
2118805,4,B0002T7YEY,I liked it. Why? The story has a twist and the movie moves along at a nice clip. The bad guys make a hero heroic. The villains in this movie are mean enough to give the protagonist a satisfying victory. Fun flick.,1392249600,,213,4.095238095238095
2118806,3,B0002T7YEY,"I was entertained by this movie and liked the concept that there was more to it than the mystery of who this boy's parents were and his quest to find out. The acting is good, and the plot interesting and often ""action."". If my kids were teens, rather than grown, I'd watch it with them, and I don't think anyone would be bored. Many actions in the movie can be used as a topic for discussion with your teen.

I'm not really one for the action scenes but they were good and used in context. Not a lot of emotional reactions though, could a young person really lose people important in his life and just ""oh well"" and carry on? I don't think so, but I guess that's not what they wanted to explore here so you just suspend realities and enjoy the next dilemma.",1391472000,,490,4.223404255319149

2118849,4,B0002T7YEY,I did not want to like this movie due to the hype but I have to admit it was a fairly good thriller... better than most really. what did it for me was Jason Isaacs as the father... he always gives it his all and you could really catch the emotion. give it a shot whether or not you like Taylor Lautner... this was a well written and well acted suspense thriller.,1390435200,,362,4.041666666666667

The answers begin to come as a home invasion, shortly after he makes an inquiry over the internet. The action only picks up as the deadly cat and mouse of escape and evasion goes by foot, auto and train across the states. Each encounter with his pursuers gives another clue - if he can just survive until the whole truth is known! High action movie with a twist on the plot.",1390176000,,478,4.263736263736264

I  didn't feel a thing for him either way and really had no desire to stay until the end of the  as i could predict what happened. Very week story line. Would his dad really send him a phone with all that data? Doubtful. Why wOuld he stay with agents? I'm sure that they would have better things to do than bring up a toddler.

How does this kid even get acting gigs? He's horrible and honestly not even very attractive. I don't see what all the fuss was about. I doubt he'll have much of a career. I couldn't get past the 30 minute mark or so. I definitely do NOT recommend this to anyone!,1388966400,,402,4.302631578947368

2118881,3,B0002T7YEY,"First, potential viewers need to know that this film has what feels like a long beginning that includes high school partying and teenage relationships. Perhaps it was deemed necessary for the set up of the story but the opening would definitely appeal more to teens than mature viewers. The school assignment scenes involving the two main characters could have used a bit more elaboration. Less time partying and more time studying, with a bit more time spent on researching the assigned topic before the two make their discovery might have improved the beginning.

If you make it through the beginning of the film, you will be treated to action, suspense, explosions, clever planning on the part of the youthful main characters, interesting though unlikely story, characters that appear trustworthy and some not so much.",1388966400,,821,5.126865671641791
2118882,1,B0002T7YEY,"Unfortunatey, it cost me my time. Every bad review I subsequently read here was accurate. Bad acting, bad plot, cameo appearances just for the name.

We were unable to go out on New Year's eve as we were feeling under the weather; and decided to look for something to watch.  We stumbled on this movie and were pleasantly surprised.  It had a good story line, and was well acted.  There was good action; but yet opportunities to come down in between action scenes.  The movie was entertaining which is the primary requirement we look for in a movie.

While this movie was intended for teens and early twenty somethings, it is an enjoyable watch for just about anyone of any age.  However, it may be too intense for younger viewers as there is some mild violence in the movie..  You should evaluate the maturity of your preteen before allowing them to watch it.",1388707200,,781,4.450704225352113

2118904,3,B0002T7YEY,"While the movie moved along pretty well with some fun things thrown in, the story line was a weak.  Boiled down it really turns out to be his own fault that his adoptive (unknown to him) parents are killed.  The movie glosses over this which may be why we have so many children/teens growing up with little to no empathy.

***SPOILERS***
To be honest I got confused as to how his friend that made fake ID's was always there whenever he needed him even though Taylor was taking a train across the country and was driving all night and then ended up back in his home city. It was a little confusing and they needed more details.

I will say it was original the story was good and who he was but they didn't FULLY explain why his parents gave him up to keep him safe. So that left me wanting.

For instance, Taylor Lautner clearly looks ethnic but he has two white parents and he's wondering if he was abducted.  He should have been asking that question a long time ago.

2118934,3,B0002T7YEY,"I couldn't finish this movie, but not because it was badly acted.  It was just not good enough for the cast.

The problem was the script, a horrible mixup of 1990s teen angst flick and a somewhat turgid action pic.

Here's an example. The opening scene.  Car-surfing. ""Let's establish our protagonist as a Cool Guy by having him do something that's not just stupid, but that endangers other drivers as well! And just for grins, let's establish it with a cutaway to a speedometer going above the speed limit for that road!"" So, he's riding on the front of the car, without hand-holds, and they're doing 70, but he's not being hit by bugs or even showing any sign of the wind - I'm a motorcycle rider, I know better.  This just establishes him as stupid and careless of other people.  Yet he's also shown as a ""smart kid"" ... I'm not buying

And then when he gets home, his ""father"" forces him to fight with him. Something that's clearly a common practice. They're in the freaking suburbs. This is LA, apparently, or something very like it. There is no way that Child Protective Services hasn't been called on this before. Not if it's as frequent as it looks like. There's a clear difference between tough love and child abuse, and while it's oversold subtext that his ""parents"" are trying to train him to be able to defend himself against unstated menaces, that doesn't meld well with keeping him ignorant of the nature of the menace.

This was in part inspired by a real abduction where a kid was raised by his abductor as his son, but he systematically lied, distorted, and isolated the kid, unlike our protagonist.  And yes, the kid did see his own face on a milk carton. But that is far different from the online ""abduction alert"" thing in the movie, that gives a national number to call but doesn't say to contact local police - no. Even if the kid is stupid enough that he falls for this, the girlfriend-interest is not.  She should have asked her folks, or a teacher, and they would have gotten the real police involved.  Maybe they did, later, but by this point, I was just not up to watching further.

It was just unbelievable.  And the dialogue did NOT help, and the behind-the-scenes spy-stuff cut right through my disbelief suspenders and left my pants on the floor.

This script needed either one more or one less round of edits.  A good job of directing might have helped, I suppose. The direction was functional at best.

The actors were all better than the script, which is why it gets an ""OK"" rating.

At some point I will be bored and I will try to watch it all the way through, with the hope that I can either ignore the stupid parts and enjoy the inevitable fight scenes.  But I don't like watching movies where I have to skip the plot because it's got too many holes.",1386806400,,2787,4.474308300395257

I enjoyed this film, aside from the high-school angst and tragedy of the people who protected and cared for him most of his life,  but it came across as obvious that they loved him, and did all they could to 'prepare' him for a less-than-normal life.

Sigourney Weaver also did an excellent job - just right.

I kept waiting for a decent car chase, no fruit basket.  Apparently they couldn't afford to damage the BMWs, that's the problem with product placement flicks.  Character development was poor, but the plot wasn't too bad.  Overall, the acting was lackluster.  It was worth three stars, I watched it to the end.",1383868800,,467,4.679012345679013

2118965,4,B0002T7YEY,"During the first 10-15 minutes of this film, I wondered why I had decided to watch it; it seemed to be just another teenage angst film about hard-partying kids dissing each other. Then Nathan (Taylor Lautner) finds a website that makes him suspect that he is adopted and the parents who have been raising him are not his real parents. The plot intensifies and escalates into dramatic violence quickly. Nathan and his neighbor/girlfriend are soon on the run trying to avoid deadly unknown pursuers. They don't know who they can trust, and they seem to be in constant danger. There's plenty of action and intrigue in this film, and it's far more than just a teenage romance. I recommend it for the intricate plot and fast-paced action. Taylor Lautner is destined to become a big film star - he's still early in his career with a unique look and fledgling acting skills, but you can see glimpses of the great actor that he will become.",1382832000,,932,4.654545454545454

Taylor is obviously a very young actor. There were some big names in this film, but the script was atrocious. This might be the first time in movie history Sigourney Weaver did a bad job, but I have a feeling it was due to the script she was working with. Action movies tend to have those ""epic one liners"" but every one in this movie was terrible. All in all, Taylor Lautner is a freaking babe which is the only reason I watched this.

1. This smart teen never realized that the 2 CIA agents, looking nothing like him, raising him weren't his parents (Dad's some super spy- I think it's eventually made clear why he wasn't around).
2. Quite a training program ""Dad"" put the boy through- when action was needed he was up to it.

It's been a while since I've seen it on DVD- a person could take notes on how many things there were to complain about, remember the scene involving Apple products?, but that would take away the ""check your brain at the door"" fun out of the movie.

Amazon doesn't list any special featuresbut the Blu ray edition, at least, has 5
1. Abduction application- customizable in film experience (I assume the DVD version won't have that)

2119007,3,B0002T7YEY,I like Taylor Lautner but he seemed to be just getting through this movie not really acting through it and the plot was a little lame.,1378252800,,134,4.1923076923076925
2119008,4,B0002T7YEY,It's a pretty good action movie with good suspense. The characters are well played and directed. I thought that plot lacked a little technical consistency. Some events did not have a logical explanation for how they get there.,1378166400,,226,4.973684210526316

2119010,2,B0002T7YEY,This movie did not meet my expectations. The previews actually made the movie out to be more then what it was. I did not like the beginning at all. I fell asleep the first 10mins -15 mins. I was wanting action pack and a good story line. This movie made no sense until half way.  I bought the movie because I did like the actor Taylor Lautner but his acting was horrible in this movie. Sorrry1!!!,1377907200,,396,4.2105263157894735
2119011,5,B0002T7YEY,"Great performance by Taylor, i could watch him all day!! His performance was wonderful in this film and one could feel the tension and romance as it blossoms throughout the film! Great movie!!",1377820800,,192,4.848484848484849
2119012,5,B0002T7YEY,"For me is was a great action and suspense story.  If you enjoy spy or hidden past thrillers, this is one for you.",1377820800,,113,3.9130434782608696
2119013,3,B0002T7YEY,Some interesting stars in this but the plot lacks any real punch.  Main character is treated for dreams and temper but no connection as to why.,1377734400,,143,4.5
2119014,4,B0002T7YEY,"I watched this flick with my Prime Trial, so it was a free movie. I was entertained and have no complaints. Not a great movie, but not bad, lots of action and kept me watching. By it being basically free and decent, I gave it 4 stars.",1377561600,,234,4.0
2119015,3,B0002T7YEY,"Okay, this movie is not going to be nominated for any major theater awards but I actually enjoyed it.
The plot was plausible with an interesting twist.  The action kept your interest to continue watching to see what was going to happen next.",1377475200,,241,4.604651162790698
2119016,4,B0002T7YEY,This was a good movie but a very slow start. However once it got started it just ran away with you.  Very exciting!!,1377475200,,116,4.043478260869565
2119021,4,B0002T7YEY,"It was a very good movie. I would highly recommend this to any teen. Even though I am a mature adult, I enjoyed this movie.",1377388800,,123,3.96
2119022,5,B0002T7YEY,It kept us on the edge of our seats and had a great twist. It was kind of like a James Bond movie..,1377388800,,99,3.347826086956522
2119023,4,B0002T7YEY,"I hated the beginning of the movie; but once it got going it has plenty of action.  The premise is somewhat weak; but I hung in there to see what Taylor Lautner would do with this role.  He is playing a 15 year old (or there about) and some of the behavior is spot on (that's the part that bored me), however, when it is time to man-up, he is also on spot.  He is good in the action scenes; but hate to say it, his on screen kissing skills need some work.  I hope he doesn't kiss like that in real life.",1377302400,,503,3.854368932038835
2119024,1,B0002T7YEY,"Bad bad bad. If you didn't already know, Taylor Lautner cannot act. That may have been overlooked if the script or plot were worth devoting time to, but they aren't. The only bright bit is when you hear the mysterious father call... Dermot can act, but they don't let him for more than five minutes of the film.",1377216000,,311,4.379310344827586
2119025,3,B0002T7YEY,Plenty of action and surprises in this one.  Nice to see more of the 'Twilight' actor - though I'm sure he's matured more as an artist since this release.  Quite a hard-hitting movie in some respects.  My boys loved it (12 and 10) and my husband was pleasantly surprised by it.,1377129600,,277,4.392156862745098

2119028,4,B0002T7YEY,I liked the movie the first time I saw. So happy amazon has it for prime. Suspenseful and action packed,1376870400,,103,4.2

2119030,5,B0002T7YEY,"When you put a werewolf in an action movie...wait...wrong movie.  You might think that Twilight defined Taylor as a pouty werewolf, you are wrong.  I think he is growing into a fine actor.  I really enjoyed watching the intrigue, the action and explotions.  You have some great actors in this movie, Maria Bello and Sigourney Weaver to name a couple.  Maria made you feel her love and the action star kick butt mother protecting her son she loves.  I have watched this movie a few times and enjoyed it each time.  I say watch it and see for yourself.",1376697600,,550,4.494949494949495

2119034,4,B0002T7YEY,Well when we first saw the movie trailer we were hesitant to go see it than as the movie progressed we liked and than when it came out on prime we rented and enjoy the movie.  Taylor is a good actor and the story was very good. The action was believable and we were all entertained,1376611200,,281,4.017857142857143

2119042,2,B0002T7YEY,No one over the teen High School years will relate to this movie.  I kept waiting for some redeeming action and found none. I decided I wasted enough time on it and pulled the plug after a half hour.,1376006400,,199,4.102564102564102

2119047,4,B0002T7YEY,"Very good movie with a good story.  Fast switches to different groups within the movie make it seem a little disjointed but it works and keeps your attention if you want to follow the story line.  If all you want is action, then sit back and it will jump off the screen at you.  I'll definitely watch it again if for no other reason than to catch the nuances of the story line.",1375660800,,377,4.136986301369863

2119049,3,B0002T7YEY,This is one of those movies you'd gladly watch for free but would be annoyed if you'd paid box office prices for it.  There are no twists you didn't see early on.,1375574400,,162,4.0625

2119052,5,B0002T7YEY,"My husband and I recently moved to Pennsylvania. Before arriving, we wanted to know more about the local attractions. We rented this video to prepare us for our latest venture.

The panoramic views of the city are very accurate. The town seems to have many great views and events to attend. Although, I must say I am a bit worried about our children. The area schools have some of the best teachers and records in the area, but clearly there is an issue with underaged drinking, fornication and id fraud.

This informational video lacks many helpful guided tours we have seen elsewhere though. Most of it seems to be spent in undisclosed locations. The Allegheny river is hardly mentioned, nor Point State Park, the incline, zoo & aquarium, to mention a few. The traffic conditions are fairly true to form though. Fort Pitt tunnel and the roads leading up to it do not really provide ample time without the skillset of a stunt driver. Also as many of us have found out, gun crime is a real threat in this city. I too will enroll my girls in a dojo this Autumn to ensure they can properly defend themselves in hand to hand combat or when threatened by a stranger brandishing a gun.

I'm not entirely sure what to take away from this travel video other than a fair performance by the actors showing off the city. I really would have appreciated seeing more of Virginia because we do have a trip planned there soon, but again would most likely be disappointed in the lack of mentioning sites to see!",1375401600,,1496,4.533333333333333

2119055,2,B0002T7YEY,"well, it's not. While the story is ok, workable the acting just can't feel the gap. Emotionless movie is the best way I can put it.
would I watch it again? no",1375142400,,158,3.96875
2119056,1,B0002T7YEY,"Abduction? Who was abducted in this film? I was surprised that Taylor only took his shirt off only twice during the film! Maybe thats why they called it ABduction! There were holes in the story and I found myself saying ""you're stupid!"" to the main characters all throughout the movie. The ending didn't reside with the audience very well either.",1375056000,,346,4.783333333333333

2119060,3,B0002T7YEY,This movie had a slow start and a weird ending. The main problem was that the storyline was hard to believe. Taylor does a good job keeping the film from being more than bad and ending early to worth waiting to see if it gets better.,1374796800,,233,4.086956521739131

2119063,4,B0002T7YEY,"I was on the edge of my seat and even jumped a few times when I was startled by action (mostly shooting.) This movie reminded me of a ""Bourne Identity type"" movie because of the constant chase scenes and government involvement. Only these were teenagers running from killers. I thought the actors did very well at playing their rolls as terrified young people who didn't know what to do/where to go next or who to trust and/or run from.

There were some impressive self-defense moves/action that were well executed by Lautner. I liked the overall theme and the emotions that he exhibited while playing the role of someone who just found out his whole life wasn't what he'd always believed. It was kind of cool when he started to realize that all the boxing with ""dad"" was to equip him with the skills needed to defend himself if attacked, thus preparing him for the day he would be targeted. It all tied nicely together and I really loved the ending.",1374192000,,950,4.588235294117647

No - this was not avatar or titanic but it was a good movie. Action and suspense, plot turns and mystery. I thought it was worthy of 2 hours.

I think anyone who began watching this thinking they were going to get block buster is akin to buying a kia and being upset it doesn't drive like a cadillac.

Still a good, solid movie.",1373673600,,415,4.036585365853658

2119076,5,B0002T7YEY,This is a really interesting fast paced movie.  From the beginning the character played by Taylor Lautner is trying to find out who he is and who is parents are.  There are numerous twists and turns throughout the movie as he continues to look for answers as well as evade the people chasing him without understanding why.,1373328000,,322,4.631578947368421

2119092,3,B0002T7YEY,"It's an okay movie with a designated teenage audience.  For adults, it's a bit unrealistic.  The kids will like it because of Taylor Lautner's likability and celebrity.",1372118400,,168,5.185185185185185
2119093,2,B0002T7YEY,The movie felt like a poorly contrived version of the Bourne identity.  The main actor gave the least believable performance.,1372118400,,125,5.25
2119094,2,B0002T7YEY,"Incredibly Cheese... plot kills you, they had something that could have been cool and they blew it! The story wasn't smoothed together, it was thrown into a blender with a list of good actors who despite only making cameo appearances ended up getting chewed up by the blades of this horrendously bad plot.",1372032000,,305,4.773584905660377

2119098,3,B0002T7YEY,"I saw so many people saying how terrible this was and how you should just watch something else.
yes, the acting was a bit sub par, but that's what you get for casting a member of the twilight cast so soon.
yes, the story was a bit out of whack, but it could be followed.
the action was good, and video quality was amazing compared to some other movies made just as bad.
i think they did the best with what they could, and if you need to waste some time, this isn't a bad option.
if you're looking for something new and fun to watch however, this probably isn't your movie.",1371945600,,572,4.116071428571429

Acting was marginal; shame to see Sigourney Weaver now has to take these parts to work. The action was OK.

I have RoadRunner Extreme internet service and expected high quality video which I do receive when I purchase Internet movies through DirecTV or NetFlix.  There was video breakup with Amazon Prime viewing of this movie.  In the center of the screen there was also a rotating yellow circular arrow throughout the entire length of the movie.  This may have been due to slow streaming speed of the movie.  I do not believe that the limitation was my Internet connection with Roadrunner Extreme, but suspect that the Amazon server infrastructure is not as robust as that of NetFlix or DirecTV???",1371340800,,689,4.905172413793103

What ever happened to the uncle the Lily Collins called? Was he also murdered? Did she really have an uncle???

The acting is very good, the action and conflict are intense and the film moves along at a quick pace.  The story is basically an updated version of the whole ""boy on the milk carton"" scenario, revised as the ""boy on the website"".  Clever and plausible.

Taylor Lautner is a pretty bad actor and the level of voyeurism they use to highlight this young man's body is creepy. Everything Lily Collins does in the movie is stupid. If you watch the film, just wait until you see the part when she calls her uncle... um, seriously? I gave this movie 2 stars only because I like action.

2119186,3,B0002T7YEY,"I liked Hanna better.  She and the film had more personality than Abduction.  Taylor Lautner comes across too dry compared to his counter part, Lily Collins",1365897600,,156,4.961538461538462
2119187,2,B0002T7YEY,"You guys are harsh! I thought it would be the worst movie this side of six feet. I have seen better but I've also seen worse. The effects were lacking as some have pointed out. As for the choppiness or lack of flow, I feel that way about quite a few movies lately. So the guy can't cry on que. What was somewhat disturbing is his inability to act like a teenager.  The party scene was pitiful. Maybe he should just model cause his posture is strong. (Check him walking through the stadium-loosen up man!) Anyhow, he's great with the action stuff. Which makes me think he can follow direction/training well. So with some coaching maybe... Or better yet, some age may give more experience to pull from? IDK cause I wouldn't attempt to act; I just watch the movies. And this one didn't offend me like it apperently did the rest of you.",1365897600,2,832,4.402597402597403

One thing that I really appreciated was there wasn't a lot of sex scenes in it.  It was just a good action movie.  This is one my daughter and I enjoyed.  Probably because of two different reasons.  She liked it because of the romance side of it; while I on the other hand enjoyed the action part.

Taylor Lautner does a fine job of breaking out of his Twilight role; however, there are plenty of scenes early on where he goes shirtless as if in homage to his ""team jacob"" fans.",1363737600,,344,4.359375

This is a suspence movie with some kick-ass action and fighting scenes in which Taylor Lautner looks so super sexy. In this movie he plays Nathan, a seemingly normal teenager in love with his neighbor (Lily Collins), that is until he sees his baby picture on a missing persons list. After that his life is anything but normal involving car chases with the CIA, hand to hand fighting with guys out to kill him, all the while trying to figure out who he really is and who his birth parents are and just who he can really trust. Taylor does an excellent acting job in this movie and his fight scenes are flat out incredible, badass, sexy, and did i mention oh so sexy. I strongly recommend that everyone, especially every girl, watch this movie. I really hope they do a sequel cause this movie, well honestly it freakin' kills!

The plot has potential, even if a bit unoriginal, but the writing is terrible and the acting seems forced.  I was sad to see the quality supporting actors, like Sigourney Weaver, Alfred Molina, and Jason Isaacs dragged into this waste of effort.  Weaver had possibly the worst and most mind boggling line of the entire film - ""I hate balloons.""  Lautner and Collins have a long way to go before they can be considered decent actors.

Truly the only decent acting came from Sigourney Weaver and she had a minor part.  Other reviews go into more detail, but let's just say this:  Taylor Lautner is wooden and mechanical; directing is poorly thought out scene construction; abrupt story development twists; sophomoric script/dialog filled with high school romance cliches; and finally, a just awful execution when all put together.  Don't waste your time even if the least bit curious.  IT IS AWFUL!!",1362355200,,560,5.043478260869565

See for example that either they love the movie or hate it. Despite the bad reviews remains at 4 star average rating.

2119291,4,B0002T7YEY,"Teen heart-throb, Taylor Lautner, finally has his own feature film, and while the story sounded pretty good, I didn't expect much. To be honest, the only thing I've seen him in were the Twilight films and I hated them! In Abduction, Lautner shows that he's more than just a pretty face. Not only can this kid act, but he's a martial arts expert too! The story is super strong and he is supported by some great veteran character actors, like Sigourney Weaver. The story follows a boy, who while doing a school project, finds a picture of himself on a missing person website. It leads him into an unbelievable story, full of twists and turns. It's unbelievable, yes, but it's still entertaining! Abduction is an action film, with a very solid background story and some fairly big names. Don't let the big name Teen Idol starring in it, keep you away. If you love a good action film, like I do, this one's a winner!",1361577600,,912,4.533333333333333

I'd say I'd give it easily between 4 and 5 stars and I decided to round up my score to a full 5 stars because it really kept my interest.

  I watched the beginning and felt a bit sorry for this kid who seemed to me to have a bit of an overly tough father. The father reminded me of one of my high school gym teachers. But as time went on and things began to unfold there were several twists and turns along with plenty of action.

  I found myself thinking several times during the movie 'wow, this is pretty cool'. I didn't expect it to be interesting and it kept me wondering what was driving everything that was happening for most of the movie. Watch it and see who you think you can trust as the plot continues to evolve. I enjoyed it and I hope you do also.",1361491200,,930,4.110497237569061

Not in my opinion, and I'm not a young groupie. Lily Collins does a superb job, also. Both are seasoned actors who put their heart into this. I dragged my husband to see this, and he left a believer. Said it was one of the better movies he's seen lately. Is it because the people who disliked this movie expected to have a rerun of ""Twilight"" or were they hoping for something more explosive? The beginning made me wonder if it would be a teen movie, but it quickly elevated into an non-stop action movie, that left me wanting more. Jumping out of cars, running from the bad guys, cars, trains and on foot. Who could want more?? I was hoping for the best. And it delivered.

2119309,1,B0002T7YEY,"Here be spoilers.

The question for me, in the end, is whether anyone could be that stupid and actually survive to the end of the movie. A CIA operative (those aren't supposed to work inside the US) who is supposed to be guarding this kid while pretending to be his mother for the last 14 years or so, beats down one bad buy and doesn't pick his gun up. Doesn't go for her own either. Predictably she promptly gets shot with a small caliber silenced weapon and drops stone dead. The second fake family member gets killed with equal ease while telling the dumb as a fence post kid to run. Kid stands and waits for bad guys to come and shoot him too, then finally runs off straight down the middle of the well lit street.

Then he remembers he has abandoned his neighbor's teen daughter and goes back for her, then vanquishes the remaining assassin who has killed his 'parents' but leaves him lying next to his gun and runs out of the house. Somehow a bomb has materialized in the kitchen oven so the house blows up. Neither bad guy ever had a chance to put it there.

Fleeing he calls the cops and instead gets put directly through to the CIA. Somehow the European bad guys have also tapped the entire US phone system and hear everything.

At some point there is a CIA briefing where they explain that the idiot kid's father has stolen a list of dishonest CIA folks from someone in Europe. Ten days ago. But hang on, this all started about 14 years ago, what has 10 days ago got to do with anything? It's the idiot kid trying to find his real self that has triggered this. How do the bad guys know that his real father has anything to do with him? Did it just so happen that ten days and ten years got mixed up?

Later the kids find their way to a safe house. So, knowing the CIA is all over the phone system what do they do? They try to call someone and immediately blow their safe house. IQ in single digits?

Everyone is instantly on their trail, almost like they had the script to refer to.

Later they arrange a meeting with the CIA, the Europeans take down all the CIA security team without being spotted. If the CIA are this bad we need to fire them all.

This is a teen fantasy film apparently written by a 13 year old. Fast cars, marshal arts, guns that kill 100% reliably, hot and semi willing girls and he even saves the world. Or something.

The first 15 minutes involves characters staring at each other with either the ""I wanna do you"" or ""I wanna kill you"" faces. If that isn't enough of a bad start we have to add the old, ""I like this girl but she is dating someone else...but it's okay because they will break-up in 5 minutes because hes a douche"", cliche. The chemistry between the two protagonists makes me cringe. Finally there is the scene where his [spoilers] fake parents are killed. The guy shoots his mom with some stupid looking gun. There is no blood to speak of after she is lying on the ground dead for 5 minutes. I swear it was a tranq gun. So in conclusion from the first 30 mintues, bad acting, overuse of cliches, and s***ty action effects. Watch at your own risk.",1359331200,,827,4.3076923076923075

2119335,3,B0002T7YEY,"This movie taught me two things about Taylor Lautner.
1) He's a terrible actor.
2) He can kick ass almost as good as Liam Neeson.
So as long as T-Laut isn't ever cast as a leading man again he should be able to enjoy a long career.

Abduction is wonderfully written. Who hasn't sat in a high school classroom and dreamed that they'd discover they were actually involved in an international espionage plot with super martial arts skills? Unfortunately, Lautner can only scowl his way through this movie, which prevents me from giving it more than three stars. However, with Alfred Molina and Sigourney Weaver rounding out the cast, this movie is definitely worthy of a look.

Abduction is action-packed, tightly constructed and well shot. It's a fun movie that you can lose yourself in for a while without having to shut your brain off.",1358899200,,835,4.751724137931035
2119336,4,B0002T7YEY,"Ahh Taylor Lautner!!! Ok let us begin, he was (at least in this movie) angled as possibly the next big action star. Which as a fan of the action genre, I would never deny fresh meat. (No offense to the Rock, Tom Cruise, Mark Whalberg and that English guy in all those Transporter movies) Knowing Taylor's beginning and background I think he is absolutely poised to fill the shoes of an action star. He definitely has the ""moves like Jagger"" (yes, I used a corny pun there)to be a real action star who will be able to give us the fans believable stunts, moves and fight scenes we salivate over.

As for this movie, it was a fun and very straightforward simple action movie. There isn't any twists, turns or crazy suspense that will leave you gasping, despite this, it was still enjoyable. Look, it is what it is, don't watch this movie expecting some outta world experience, watch this movie at face value and you will enjoy it.

Taylor's acting (as it was in Twilight)does leave something to be desired but that's nothing some lessons won't be able to help develop. We have actors with WORSE abilities who are starring in movies.

It's a good movie to watch on a Friday night after a long work week, with some pizza and beer and just as a way to relax with no need to use one's brain cells.

However, I can't fault Lautner, entirely, because this movie takes a very long time to a) introduce the characters and b) get to the inciting incident, perhaps because John Singleton decided to give us a shirtless Lautner twice during this time (so he's clearly leading with his ace there).

By the time we figure out that Lautner's parents aren't who he thinks they are and that someone's after him, we don't care.  (Let's just set aside the fact that Lautner doesn't look like either of his 'parents'; more fatal is that his parents are oozing charisma and energy while Lautner can't hold focus onscreen without removing his shirt.)

Perhaps this is a transition for Lautner. He's a big enough star that the pressure's on him to make the next, post-Twilight gig a success, and lord knows he should be able to fail once without it being fatal.  To that end, if you're remotely interested in him or his career trajectory, see at least 20 min of this dog of a movie.

Between the hackneyed storyline, the bland action coupled with vomit-inducing teen romance, the awkward dialogue, and the weirdly horrible camera angles (seriously, what?), there's really no reason you should ever watch this turd. Seriously, I hope you're just reading these reviews for laughs, and not actually thinking about streaming it.

It was in fact so horrible that my girlfriend was too busy raising her eyebrow and letting out an exasperated ""huuuuuh?"" to enjoy Lautner with his shirt off. Unless you're a Twilight fan (in which case you CLEARLY don't care about logic or story or depth anyway), don't watch this. I think I had more fun in the 5 minutes spent writing this review than I did in the whole two hour runtime.

The plot is easy enough to follow, but the script is kinda terrible, the character development is slow and there are definitely some holes in the deets. I don't quite understand how a high schooler outruns and outsmarts both the ""CIA"" and some international independent covert group bristling with state of the art technology. It also doesn't make sense that he could contact his friend constantly somehow without getting caught, but the bad guys can trace any car he's driving from a random security camera nearby. There were so many moments where I had to tell my logic to take a hike and just watch.  Weaver and Molina are great actors and Lautner is just hot (in his own way), but combined they are way too good for this movie. I watched it once to satisfy my curiosity and that's enough for me, I will never watch it again. If I want to see Taylor Lautner without his shirt, I can just watch the Twilight Saga, where his squinting-and-supposed-to-be-seductive eyes, clenched jaw, and bulging muscles totally work with him being a werewolf. Unfortunately, it's too much for this movie. Actually, upon further thought, this movie is quite awful, but I still like the Weaver/Molina/Lautner combo.",1356048000,,1350,4.83982683982684

Here, Taylor Lautner is allowed to show his significant talent as an actor (the ""Twilight"" series restricted him).  The plot of ""Abduction"" is interesting, with some unusual twists, and keeps the viewer's attention through the whole film.  We find ourselves caring about what happens to the protagonist.  Maria Bello and others in the supporting cast are excellent in their roles.  We first saw ""Abduction"" in the theater, then bought the DVD, and now lend it to friends.

Would you rather have action (void of blood and suffering, as people die instantly from completely dry gunshot wounds) than interesting character and plot development?
Do you like watching teenybopper flicks like Lizzy McGuire, but wish they had a little more excitement?

If you're the bad guy and can tap into any computer, video surveillance camera or electronic device...why in the world can't you tap into a cell phone to get the code that you need?

Other questions...Why isn't there any blood on the shoot victims? Why was there a tear come out of Taylor's eye but have not emotion on his face? Why was the movie called abduction? Who was abducted? Was the cell phone the abducted? How did Taylor remember the name of the apartment address and the people he was supposed to be on his side, without writing them down?

The movie felt fake and the entire plot wasn't the very best, I felt as if I was watching a low budget show series of Nikita. The plot thing just wasn't doing it for me.

Calling him wooden is an insult to carpenters everywhere.
Some other famous actors helped, but Taylor's monotone ""acting"" ruined it all.

To the contrary, not once did I see a nice choreographed fight scene, I would call each and everyone of them scuffles at best. He does do a nice jump kick...but that's about it.

- Bad guys tapping the same phones the CIA is using without them knowing
- Instant HD security camera access on every building on every street corner with face recognition and license plate technology
- Bad guys knowing where everyone is and being able to get there instantly...while the CIA is stuck in traffic.
- CIA has access to every HD security camera in the country and they're using it to find this kid and not the guy trying to kill/capture him
Just to name a few questionable plot elements.

The lack of blood in the movie, could be a sign of the audience they were going for.  I thought they were using surpress tranquilizer pistols in the beginning of the movie until I saw the other characters' reactions.

I would give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 because I think it really has gotten an unnecessarily bad rep.

I think Taylor Lautner has great potential as a future action film star as he does a lot of really impressive fighting and cool stunts in the film. There was more of him doing all that than I expected.

I also liked Lily Collins in Mirror Mirror and enjoyed seeing her in another movie. She's cute and likable.

Sigourney Weaver and Alfred Molina as two of the CIA agents add two veteran personalities to the screen that further its watchability.

The plot and mystery is obviously accessible enough for the age group of tweens and early teenagers who are Lautner's fan base, but I'm in my late 20s and enjoyed it. It's no Bourne Identity, but is fun light action thriller fare when you want something exciting but not too mentally draining. (and much better than any of the twilight movies, which isn't saying much, but there you are.)",1348099200,,1127,4.456310679611651

2119420,3,B0002T7YEY,"Farfetched and formulaic, the action/adventure Abduction (2011) seems to be primarily focused upon entertaining a teenage audience, as the film attempts to capitalize on the popularity of Taylor Lautner, hot from his recent appearances in the Twilight films.  Some spoilers follow.

While doing research for a school project with his friend Karen Murphy (Lily Collins), Nathan Harper (Lautner)  discovers evidence that his parents may not be his biological parents.  When Nathan contacts a website for missing kids, his location is traced, black ops terrorist Nikola Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist) is alerted, and a pair of hitmen are deployed to the Harper residence.  Nathan's father (Jason Isaacs) and mother (Maria Bello) are both killed, and their home destroyed, leaving Nathan and an injured Karen in shock.

At a hospital, Nathan calls the police, but he gets connected to CIA operative Frank Burton (Albert Molina), who tells him what he already knows, that someone is after him.  With the help of Geri Bennett (Sigourney Weaver), Nathan's psychiatrist, the young couple manage to escape.  Bennett says she works for the CIA, and that Nathan's real father Martin, was also a CIA agent.

The pair is soon on their own, following clues that have them on a train bound for Nebraska, with both the CIA and the Kozlow's terrorists tracking them.  Eventually, after surviving several attempts on his life, Harper is contacted by Koslow, and they arrange to meet at a Pittsburg Pirates game.

Abducted, actually has no abduction, but is jam packed with clichd elements.  It may be unfair to judge the movie by ""adult"" standards, as intended mostly for teens, it has a different set of priorities.  The romance element slows the pace a bit, and probably makes the film longer than it needs to be.  Fortunately Taylor Lautner and Lily Collins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blind-Side/dp/B002VECM72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blind Side</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirror-Mirror/dp/B005LAII0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirror Mirror</a>) have very good chemistry, as their characters spend most of the film joined at the hip.  A few years from now, it would not be at all surprising, if the bewitching Collins has the more distinguished career.

Lautner handles the action and fight sequences competently enough, but the story lacks credibility, as the screenplay is dialed down so that Nathan Harper can appear to be on equal footing with both the CIA, and a ruthless terrorist.  Those expecting a taught action thriller will probably be disappointed, but Abduction isn't quite as bad as some have said.  Keeping in mind the kind of movie it is, it's a decent watch, particularly while it is available to Prime members.",1347926400,,2809,5.553990610328638

He has enough of his own charisma to carry him through this movie luckily plus he's not so bad to look at either. I really liked how the movie started then once the story started unfolding I was disappointed. There was absolutely no charisma between Lautner and Collins.

That's pretty sad that in order for great actors to keep working they have to attach themselves to movies where bad actors are carrying the film.  Taylor Lautner was acceptable, but the guy has zero range and believability.

2119443,3,B0002T7YEY,"After 4 and soon to be 5 Twilight movies, Taylor Lautner (aka Jacob) is Nathan, a typical young teenage outcast he's good at high school wrestling, has rage issues, also strange dreams involving some woman being attacked by a guy in a mask and has this strange feeling that his life is not what it seems. So what are the chances he's right? Well stumbling onto a missing children's website and discovering he could've been abducted (which may have possibly, just possibly lead to the title of the film), but by who?

Well if we knew that then there would be no need for anything past the first 30 minutes. The rest of the film has the usual cliches, who can he trust, who is real in his life and who is fake, then the action scenes where you must of course supsend your disbelief. There's also a good amount of overdone music to go along with the movie, with lots of one-dimensional cardbord cutout characters.

However it does sport a good cast, Maria Bello (Coyote Ugly) and Jason Issacs (The Patriot) play Nathan's parents, Alfred Molina is typical as a high ranking CIA official and Sigourney Weaver (Alien, Galaxy Quest) is his therapist who wants to help him find out the truth behind what's going on. There's the usual girlfriend played by Lily Collins (Mirror Mirror, The Blind Side) who is an extremely beautiful girl but isn't given much more to do than run and look scared.

Most films like this need to be taken with a grain of salt, or maybe a whole shaker and ""Adbuction"" is no exception. But it does breeze by and even with all the cliches it stays a good clip and again the cast does help. Lautner does have a good screen presence outside of the Twlight franchise and does well in this action/spy flick.

2119449,2,B0002T7YEY,"""Abduction"" (directed by John Singleton, his first feature film in six years) looks like a Jason Bourne film without Jason Bourne. You don't have Matt Damon here. What you get in this generic thriller is ""Twilight"" star Taylor Lautner as uninteresting hero, a few veteran actors who look terribly bored, as characters (""good"" and ""bad"" alike) that you really don't care, and a storyline that doesn't make sense. As to the film's action set-pieces, they are not bad, except that they are too few and far between.

While doing homework with his childhood friend Karen (Lily Collins) living across the street, an ordinary high school boy Nathan (Taylor Lautner) finds an old photo of himself as a little boy on a missing persons' website. Next moment he is chased by not just one, but two groups of operatives, one led by Michael Nyqvist and the other by Alfred Molina. Nathan sets out to discover the truths about his parents, fending off the chasers.

Despite the first-rate supporting cast including Maria Bello, Jason Isaacs and Sigourney Weaver, ""Abduction"" fails to be really involving throughout, with a poorly-written script that does not give us any reason to care what is going on. Things work out too conveniently. Characters' motives are often impossible.

I know this is a thriller and I am willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy it. Sadly there is not much that we can enjoy here. The contrived story and implausible setting are fine as long as the film has a natural flow of storytelling and a healthy dose of action, mystery or humor, none of which ""Abduction"" has.",1338595200,3,1577,4.855018587360595

Lautner has a black-belt, so I thought he did a good job executing those scenes.  However, the dialogue was PAINFUL (even when Sigourney Weaver spoke) and the ""romantic"" scenes made me cringe.  The lead actress looks all of 14 years old, so I found the make-out scene more disturbing than erotic.

They are looking up abducted children when Nathan finds a photo of a child that looked like him. He decides to investigate further.

Since the title of the movie is ""Abduction"" we now know the bare bone plot. The question remains are the details and twists going to make this an interesting film? Yawn!

But then all of a sudden the action literally explodes onto the screen. The movie becomes fast paced with a good rapid sound track. Nathan along with his traveling girl friend quickly develop the skills of a movie CIA operative while Taylor Lautner's acting abilities have remained unchanged. In one scene Karen is screaming, but her lips aren't moving...some poor dubbing. Nathan's flashbacks to his father teaching how to fight was very cliche. There is also the teen heart throb aspect of the movie, as clearly this movie was geared toward them.

Taylor will probably be a good successor for Tom Cruise after Tom decides to retire or do some other genre. Tom has a lot to go yet, but time doesn't stop. Lautner is athletic, good looking, acts well and is fun to watch.

All in all, a movie to keep in ones DVD library.",1333324800,,463,4.133333333333334
2119473,3,B0002T7YEY,"I love action movies of all kinds so despite the fact that I don't particularly care for the leading man I decided to give this movie a try.

Cons:
*Acting- Taylor wasn't terrible but he doesn't portray emotion very well. Nathan's character is outgoing (party boy) reckless (rides on top of a car at 65 mph without anything to hold him) seemingly a bad boy (drives a motorcycle and goes to a therapist for anger management). Yet he's a complete softie (""What mom, you don't trust me because I stayed out late and forgot to check-in first?"") that cries multiple times in the movie with no expression on his face while water drips from his eyes.

*Lacks a strong connection between characters and audience- There are some movies that you are so wrapped up in the story that you cringe or gasp when bad things happen to the leading actor or actress but in Abduction I really could not have cared less if the Nate or his girl were killed. I think the only people I felt sorry for were the parents who raised Nathan that were shot. That's about it. And they had some of the smaller roles in this movie.

*Romance- I normally have no issues with on screen loves but this one annoyed me when the writers kept including cheesy scenarios and dialogue like, ""Nathan, are we going to die?"" Then Nathan slowly walks up to her and grabs her pulling her close. ""No. I won't let that happen."" That is one of a few. The way it was purposely made so dramatic just really bothered me.

*No surprises- I don't know if it's just because I have watched too many action movies but there wasn't anything that made me think ""oh wow I wasn't expecting that!"" It wasn't predictable but I didn't think it was very inventive either. I think the most surprise I had was *SPOILER ALERT* when Nathan's biological father shot to bad guy in the end. I expected they would give Nathan an ""epic"" and unrealistic fight. I'm glad that did not happen. *END SPOILER*

Pro:
Action- I think they got it right on with the action and it started early at about 30 minutes in which made me very happy! Considering the fact that the majority of Abduction consists of action it is what makes this movie worth watching (at least at a rental price).",1333152000,,2200,4.449131513647643

i liked it.
the story, the acting and the ending!
A great Teen Action movie worth watching with your friends.

It had love, mystery, drama and it will keep you glued to the screen and wondering what happens  next.

Some of the fighting were unnecessary and over the top but i guess this was Mr. Lautners way
of allowing the world to see his skills. and all those close ups were just weird.

Taylor Lautner may not be Tom Cruise yet, but watch out! I think he'll soon be in the same league as Matt Damon, Tom Cruise, Ethan Hawke, etc.

I think someone should tell Lily Collins she should have TWO eyebrows -  I found it very disconcerting to see that caterpillar across her brow!  On the other hand, Nathan's father?

Well, I did like Twilight and I liked looking at him in Twilight (sorry guys). I couldn't stand him for 5 minutes in this terribly predictable story. Come on? Did you think you would sell the movie off of offering him as a sex symbol? It starts with the main character getting into an ""almost confrontation"" with a guy at a typical rich kid party that just happens to have 200 kids at a house where the parents aren't home. Come on. Haven't we seen this like a million times already! His friends, no wait, a girl (that he supposedly has some history with) keeps him from getting into a confrontation. Of course she was the typical beauty (I guess?). Then his friends help him to forget about the guy and the girl by offering to get him drunk. Yes, because this is what young people do, right? He takes a drink from a red cup that is so obviously empty and all of sudden wakes up passed out on the lawn with no shirt on, revealing his muscular body. OK, stop right there! No wait, there's more... his father pulls up out of no where, gets him in the car and takes him home to train him in boxing. His mother comes out to ground him for a week for staying out. Then he ends up in therapy because he of course has anger issues. The counseling session was so horrible! Not worth the time. Predictable and lame with no substance at all. The writer should have used the actor in a better way. He has a good rep from his acting in Twilight and now this? What about his skill? Or is he just a body?",1331683200,,1625,4.194888178913738

He does a good job and the plot is fun, not immortal prose but fun.  The climactic scene at the Pirates game was excellent.  Good performances by supporting cast too.  There were a few jarring plot moments for me (such as being ordered about by a parent), solely caused by my ""advanced"" age, but then I'm not the target demographic for Abduction.  Shoppers should set aside preconceived notions however subconscious and try Abduction.  My only negative was having to run the DVD about six times before all the skips stopped, but then that could have been my player.",1331683200,,715,4.811475409836065

Right about the time we were going to give up on it, then came non-stop action pretty much and the rest of the story so to speak. In our opinion this saved the movie and made it worth having.

2119527,1,B0002T7YEY,"Let's be fair here: some inspirational cinema may be a bit obtuse and unsophisticated, but there are plenty of worse films that don't preach any particular spiritual message. Case in point: Abduction, which stars Twilight heartthrob Taylor Lautner as Nathan Harper, a teen who, while researching for a school project on missing children, discovers that his true identity has been kept hidden from him all his life. As Nathan uncovers more about his past, he and his friend Karen are plunged into the dangerous world of his biological father, a former CIA agent embroiled in an espionage war. Apart from Lautner, who has yet to establish himself as an actor of some range, the cast is surprisingly solid: Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello, and even the original Dragon Tattoo star, Michael Nyqvist are all on board here. I say ""surprisingly"" because, despite this pedigree, Abduction is one of the worst films I saw in 2011. The film is soulless and incompetent.

There is some really cheesy lines in this movie but I don't find either of the actors to be bad. Taylor Lautner is really improving with each movie and let's face it the guy is likeable he has the charisma, the charm, and the ability to do his stunts. I hope we will actually be seeing a lot more of him in movies because I think he will only continue to improve and impress audiences. This movie I am glad to own it is not necessarily something I will watch every day but I don't think it is as bad as people claim it is just because of their hatred for the actor or his previous work.

I went into this wanting to see if Taylor Lautner could be relatively interesting all on his own without his merry band of sparkly vampires and scantily clad werewolves. Beyond that, there was truly no expectations. I think that is how you need to approach this film.  So many of the really bad and uber harsh reviews all read EXACTLY the same... its disturbing.

I read the reviews, then watched the film, then read more reviews.

To me it seems as though many go in *wanting* to hate this film, probably for the simple fact that it stars Taylor Lautner no matter how much they say they didn't want to.

This is an okay to even half way decent action film. Is it the best one out there? No. Is it the worst? Far from it.

Go into this film wanting to be entertained by a basic action flick for a couple of hours and you probably won't be all that disappointed. Don't look here for any ground breaking cinema... but rarely does one check out an action flick to do so. Were there a few unanswered questions? Yes but most films leave you a couple once the credits begin to roll. I didn't feel there were as many gaping plot holes like a lot of people said. In my opinion with all movies there is some suspension of disbelief.

(5.) Body narcissism as lead protagonist does a few shirtless scenes and shows off mixed martial arts skills.
(6.) Lead protagonist has poster filled room; plays video games; also rides a motorcycle to music of course. Parents are not really his parents; he's got a secret adopted past.
(7.) Stereotype psychiatrist sounding like she got her doctorate from Hollywood U. Stereotype teachers acting like they got their certificates from Glee. Stereotype Eastern Europeans bad guys acting like every Eastern European bad guy that's ever appeared in a movie. CIA, NSA, FBI, SS agents all dressed in black looking like angry financial institution board members and type cast from the same rigid thinking and language school that the actual FBI, military intelligence come from (I know). high school African American as nerdy computer hacker and fake ID maker (yes, even that type cast has appeared before).

2119539,3,B0002T7YEY,"I like action movies so we watched this to see what it was about. Young Nathan (Taylor Lautner) is a wild child High School student who does stupid pranks and gets drunk at parties. He has anger issues and is prone to violence at times and his psychologist is trying to help him understand what is causing these outbursts of bad behavior.

Nathan believes he has found out that he is an abducted child and unwittingly set in motion a fast paced action movie that is not too badly done. I liked the chase scenes and some of the fight scenes are also very good.

What brings this movie down are the following items:

* The story develops slowly as the characters are developed but it is too slow and boring.
* The out of control teenager in the beginning is over the top and does not compare to the same Nathan character in the middle and the end of the movie.
* The acting is not the best in this movie and it appears that Taylor Lautner is trying to find his new acting role niche after his hits in the Twilight series. He did OK; but it was just OK. No other actor in this film stepped up to enhance the story enough to save the movie.

If you like action scenes, chases and good fight scenes then this movie might entertain you. I liked that part of the movie myself. The slow pace, bad dialog and acting just seemed to drag it down at times.",1327708800,,1344,4.1976744186046515
2119540,3,B0002T7YEY,"Is this a ""best movie I've ever seen"" movie?  NO.  Was it a ""B"" movie?  No.  Am I glad saw it?  Yes.  To me what made this movie good was the relationship and chemistry between the characters played by Taylor Lautner (as Nathan) and Lily Collins (as Karen).  Without it, the movie would have flopped.  The story took two regular high school teens and thrust them into a dangerous (albeit unrealistic) situation where they have to get through it together.  They obviously like each other, but as is typical in that age are afraid to pursue it.  But when thrust into this, it forces them to open up to each other.  He takes the role of protector, she the encourager (while not being at all a wimp).  It forced them to face their feelings for each other.  Ok so maybe I'm just a romantic at heart, but to me this was the glue that held the story together throughout the movie.  The rest, well it was a bit corny, and boils down to just a somewhat good popcorn movie.  Take out the relationship and the story line was weak and a stretch, and the ending leaves you a bit unfulfilled.  Taylor's not the best actor, but he is ok and fights good.  Lily played it perfectly.  The rest of the acting was good and not at all what I would consider to be a ""B"" movie.  There are certain movies that just feel ""cheap"" (i.e. like many Jean-Claude Van Damme flicks) with poor cinemetography, but this is not one of them and it did not feel like a low budget movie (even if some of the special effects were not Inception quality).  Good soundtrack too - one of the best parts was the closing music - ""To Be Loved"" by Train.  It's a great song, although a bit out of place for this movie, even though it's a perfect credit-roll song.

It's PG-13 for the action/violence (which really isn't as bad as what else is out there) and a totally unecessary f-bomb.  Oh and the passionate kissing scene which does not get past the kissing (but if you're watching with your kids you will be fast-forwarding it).

So, if you like movies that have a relationship in an action setting, you should like this one.  If you are wanting to see a great thriller/action flick, go see something else.  Want to watch with pre-teen kids?  Don't.",1327536000,,2204,4.364532019704433

2119553,3,B0002T7YEY,"As it happens, I personally like the '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight/dp/B001T5D6LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight</a>' series. And sometimes an actor or actress finds the one role he/she was born to play. But sadly, once that role has finished its run, there's nothing left. They don't have the ability or reach of more talented performers. It's not a personal knock against Lautner - many artists fit this description. Unfortunately, depending on their current Q Score/hype, most fans can't or won't acknowledge it. (i.e. Daniel Radcliffe)

There's a saying: Better to have played one game in the majors - rather than ten years in the minors. You can make an okay living playing in the minors, but the point isn't to get a regular paycheck. The goal is the Big Show.

So Taylor can always look back and say that he was once on top of this world of eight billion souls. Not something many people can honestly claim.

In this decently-scripted and well-worn film, Lautner plays Nathan, a young high school student who never quite fits in. He's popular enough, certainly handsome enough. But there's a lingering vagueness about his life, an unexpressed fear that has haunted him since he was a small child. His parents have tried to help with years of therapy, and for the most part, they've succeeded. Still, like all kids with caring parents, they insinuate themselves into his life - they worry.

However, unlike most families, instead of groundings and chores, his dad forces Nathan to fight - really fight. Washing the car is replaced with hand-to-hand combat MMA style, whenever and wherever, both as punishment and mental/physical preparedness. It's an odd life, but one he's used to.

Then by pure happenstance, he's assigned a school project that deals with missing children. A random chance click on the internet brings him face-to-face with: Himself. An age-enhanced image of a child that went missing about the time of his first recollections. The memory that he's been struggling with in therapy - a woman being murdered.

Suddenly, the anonymous kid in the 'burbs finds himself in the crosshairs, both figuratively and literally. Determined contractors with serious firearms are hunting him down. His parents are killed and he's on the run.

Lautner certainly looks and moves great, but a wide range of emoting is a skillset he doesn't possess. It's one he may never get. Not for lack of trying I'm certain. But he's wooden and stiff, with little to offer an audience. I think he's a fine young man, and I certainly wish him only success. But the reality is: Fans should enjoy him today because I don't think there are a lot of tomorrows to come.

Likeable action/thriller that could've been better served with a more versatile lead.

Personal Note: Loved that you never quite see Nathan's biological father played by one of my favorite character actors, Dermot Mulroney. Kept wishing the guys from the tv series '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B0044E9JU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>' would've picked him up, but sadly, it never happened.

2119554,1,B0002T7YEY,"I'm not sure why, but up until I saw this movie I had the idea that Taylor Lautner was a fairly good actor. Umm, not so much. His skill set consists mainly of looking good and sulking/pouting. Sadly enough, his was one of the better performances here -- and it stunk. Lily Collins, the female lead, was even worse.

Speaking of Ms. Collins, she and Lautner had absolutely zilch for chemistry. The kissing/panting/hugging scenes were cringe-worthy, they were so bad. The relationships between the other actors and actresses were only slightly more believable. And I do mean slightly. The story was excessively slow and boring. Oh, and, did I mention that the one black kid in the picture is also a criminal who forges ID cards?

So, what, exactly happens in this yawn fest? (spoilers ahead -- do yourself a favor, and read this and skip the film) A kid is raised by ""foster"" parent/agents, after his mother is murdered and while his CIA father continues his work as a CIA agent. When he stumbles across a fake ""missing persons"" site with his picture on it, a host of baddies end up on his trail -- and the wooden hero and his tedious lady fair must sort the rogue agents from the good guys, and find a way to thwart the villain. Of course, they do, and the bad guys all get what they deserve. The viewer, on the other hand, is left with a sort of sick feeling in the pit of her stomach as she wonders, ""How in heaven's name could I not have something better to do than watch that?""

2119556,1,B0002T7YEY,"Horribly written and/or horrible execution...take your pick. The scenes were to cut up and fragmented and the whole movie seemed rushed. The acting was emotionless and forced from every actor in this film. I believe a robot could have shown better emotions. The only part that was convincing was the drunk party at the neighbors house.

Then they tried to make it look like Nathan (Taylor Lautner) was crying. A high school production team could have done better on his fake tear effects (and probably the whole film for that matter.) Heck you could have easily edited in the effects with any entry level video editing program and it would have looked better.

According to Wikipedia the budget was $35million. I honestly don't know what they spent the money on because you could have rented all the cars in this movie, bought some cheap pyrotechnics, editing software, tickets to the game and train ticket, hell even bought the cameras and other tech... still not even get close to $35mil and could have made this film with money to spare. Ok sure you need a good stunt team and they did hire some A list or former A list actors... but to abuse their talent in this film is just not right.

I honestly don't know how this made it to the theaters other the fact that Taylor Lautner was in it so perhaps they were targeting the teenage girl crowd and getting some of the Twilight fans to watch. Even then I would be insulted if I saw this in the theater and was part of that demographic. This should have gone straight to DVD/BlueRay or Netflix.

While the film is not without flaws in the plot and overdoes it a bit in the killing arena, it still manages to present a story that has more than one direction to follow.

Nathan (Taylor Lautner) is a likable high school teenager whose friends Gilly (Denzel Whitaker) and Billy (Allen Williamson) share a rather dangerous lust for life. Nathan's parents (Maria Bello and Ken Arnold) are supportive: the father teaches Nathan martial arts, the mother runs a strict household. Nathan gets drunk at a party, is grounded, and when given an assignment in Sociology with his across the street neighbor Karen (Lily Collins) the two discover a website for missing children: Nathan's picture appears there and that begins the trek to discover who his real parents are. In the process his adoptive parents are killed by a Russian group and Nathan and Karen are on the run. The CIA chief (Alfred Molina) informs the runaways that they are in danger and must hide. Nathan realizes he holds a code to an encrypted number system and must retain that at all costs. The plots gets a bit confused when we discover that Nathan's psychiatrist (Sigourney Weaver) is also with the CIA and that Nathan is to pass the code in a certain convoluted manner, all the while Nathan is looking for his biological father and for some meaning to his life

Lautner and Collins have a credible screen chemistry and it appears that Lautner is doing the majority of the stunts himself. This is a tense hunt and chase thriller, and while there are some holes in the story that need better definition and a huge cast of hunters for the code being killed right and left and never seem to be diminished in additional help (!), the pace is breakneck and the ending is satisfactory.

This is the First Movie I've Seen Taylor Lautner in Except for the Twilight Movies (Twilight,New Moon,Eclipse,Breaking Dawn part 1 & 2) The Movie was Really Good Taylor Did An Excellent Job! The Story line was Great held my interest thru the whole movie.

I would Watch it Again!!",1324857600,5,293,4.84
2119583,5,B0002T7YEY,"I have seen Abducton twice, and for me to even see a film twice, it must be something great.  Taylor Lautner plays a high school senior who seems to have everything, but he always felt there was something off.  He did an excellent job in the film, and I was on edge the whole time.  He has the potential to become an action star, and this was a smooth transition from the Twilight role of Jacob Black.  Do not get me wrong, Lautner did a wonderful job in the Saga too, and the books and movies were beautifully and tastefully done.  There were some sad points in Abduction, and a good part of it made me relate to my teenager days.  Of course, they were not that extreme as his was.  Lily Collins was great as his admiration as well, as I never even see her work before Abduction.  I think she will have a fine career as an actress ahead of her.

I am not going to give out spoilers, as I feel they ruin everything. There is not a lot of blood or heavy fighting in this, or so how I see it. I was able to completely follow through on the plot in Abduction, as I mostly get confused and lost during action films.  Which is the main reason why I hardly see any.

If you are up for a great performance, and lots of stunts done by Lautner himself, you are in for a sweet treat.  Just do not expect to rip his shirt off, because you will only get a peek in Abduction.  Besides, that is not what makes Taylor Lautner a fine actor.

2119584,4,B0002T7YEY,"*ATTENTION THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, THEN DON'T READ*
Okay when I first walked into the Theatre I thought this movie would be bad. I actually thought this movie would be a rendition of Jason Bourne except only for little kids. But I was wrong. This movie is exciting and okay at the same time thats why I gave it four stars. Taylor Lautner does a brilliant performance as Nathan Price a boy who has everything, good friends, good grades, smarts and looks but there is always something missing in his life. He wonders if his parents are really his parents and he keeps having the same dream of a woman being killed every day. He goes to a shrink, which is not normal. One day when two men come knocking on his door, asking for him. They kill his parents who earlier reveal to him that they are not his parents. And next thing you know he is on a quest for the truth, his house gets blown up, his neighbor who is also the girl he has feelings for Karen Murphy goes on the run with him as well. His shrink which is actually one of the CIA agents helps him elude capture by ""seemingly"" killing herself. There are scenes that make you want to hold your breath and then there are scenes that make you say ""Okay."" The girl that plays Karen Murphy with him, does an excellent job as his love interest. And being the one person that he trusts. And there is make out scene is nothing short of very hot and steamy, thats a scene where it makes you want to hold your breath. This movie is great, and it is like a Jason Bourne, but a shorter, final version. A mystery. Perfect for teenagers. Adults, eehhh, you may not look this movie too much. But I'm pretty sure adults will like it. Taylor Lautners acting could have been a little more better, but he did a borderline job of awesome and okay. But this movie is walking the line of being great and just okay. I hope you enjoy it.",1323129600,18,1911,4.238356164383561

2119586,5,B0002T7YEY,"This movie was fun from start to finish. I actually watched it twice in the same weekend, and as I go to see maybe one or two movies a year in the theater, that's saying something. There is a sort of Bourne Identity meets High School thing going on, which allowed for some brilliant action sequences and characters with much more warmth and levity than the Bourne series has. Is it realistic? No. Are there inaccuracies? Probably, not that I noticed. But I did think the plot held together very well and who goes to action adventure movies for lessons on how the world actually operates? Nathan was a fairly complex character - one who at times, particularly the beginning, I didn't like that much. I appreciated both the script and Lautner's ability to have the character grow in what seemed like feasible (given that it's a) a movie and b) all this crazy stuff is going on) and meaningful ways through the course of this adventure. He really started out as a spoiled rich kid and ended up as a competent, trustworthy and loving man which is quite a transition. I thought the love story was well played. I didn't get the impression that it was the greatest love of all time, but they're in high school for Pete's sake! And outside of Forks, most people don't find that sort of connection by the time they're 18.

I do really adore Taylor Lautner. He is beautiful and amazing to watch in action sequences. I think this sort of role suits him better than the Twilight Saga (not that I'm not a huge fan - I am!!) in that it's not quite so melodramatic. That said, given that the premise of this movie is that he finds out the people who have called themselves his parents really aren't and there are lies and secrets right and left, there is a lot of drama and Lautner pulled it off beautifully. If Taylor Lautner does more action movies (God willing) I will watch them. I think/hope that there's a possibility for a sequel or two out of the Abduction series, but only time will tell.

In short, if you're looking for a fun, exciting action/adventure movie with a quick pace and likable characters, I highly recommend Abduction.",1321142400,11,2126,4.51948051948052
2119587,3,B0002T7YEY,"I love action movies and this movie filled that requirement.  I thought that Taylor Lautner did very well with a weak script.  The heroes were escaping Pittsburgh and seeking information in Richmond Virginia.  They stopped a trucker in a Rental truck and asked to be taken to Richmond which is at least 5 hours from Pittsburgh.  It would have been more believeable if they were going to West Virginia which has two large cities within an hour's drive from Pittsburgh - especially since they quickly returned home.  This was just one example of the weaknesses in the script noticeable throughout the movie.  Even with all the problems in the film, I plan to purchase the DVD when it becomes available.",1320451200,,700,4.791666666666667

Lautner did a great job in the film, and a sweet transition from Twilight, not that that I had no problem with Twilight.  I love Twilight.

I think he looks and acts older then his age, but his performance was excellent in the film.  I'm seeing it for a second time.  :)",1317686400,,429,4.0
2119589,4,B0002T7YEY,"When I went to see this movie, a group of young girls up the back, tittered during the love scenes, and remained quiet during the action scenes.

I have seen all the Twilight movies, even though I am not the demographic. I'm on Team Vulturi.

The movie starts at a party where our hero drinks too much, and shares long lingering looks with the girl next door, and nearly gets in a fight with her toolish  boyfriend, who on an unconscious level realises there must be some attraction between these two.

On a more unconscious level our hero wakes up on the lawn the following morning while the girls remove litter from the lawn.  He is shirtless.  Titters of recognition from the back. When he returns home the man he knows as his father engages him in a fight  repeatedly hitting him.  This seems like parental abuse as the woman he knows as his mother looks on unconcerned. He has mad karate skills.

Later working on the school project, with the aforementioned girl next door who we now notice has rather large eyebrows, they see an age enhanced photo of a missing child who looks like him.  What he does next drives the narrative of the entire movie, with a series of stunning action events forcing him to question his entire existence, and no one is who or  what they appear to be, apart from eyebrow girl.

He and eyebrow girl flee for their lives, and now he must go back to a past he never knew he had to discover who he really is, what really happened, and why both the CIA and an international crime syndicate wants to capture him now.

Eyebrow girl is played by Lily Collins, daughter of musician Phil. You may recognise her as the sister from The Blind Side. And apparently she is going to be Snow White in Snow White.  Those eyebrows are going places.

I found the movie quite engaging. Lautner has great Karate skills, and the action scenes were well done.  The fact that he has won several gold medals on the World stage, and done Karate from an early age gave him a certain authority and believability in these scenes.

Some people claim there was not enough chemistry between the two stars.  I did not find this to be the case, and apparently she and Taylor Lautner dated in real life for a while, so there was some attraction. Perhaps some of the young ladies thought they could do a better job in those scenes.  By the way, there is only one scene where it gets steamy and that gets interrupted.

I think Taylor Lautner is most likely of the Twilight stars to be a big boxoffice star after the Twilight series is over. I think the tittering girls will agree.

I hope this was helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie.",1317600000,,2640,4.413223140495868
2119590,5,B0002T7YEY,"I just came from the theater and thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  Although it started just a wee bit slow, it quickly got hot and carried a lot of action all through the movie.  It was basically CIA spy stuff and running from the bad guys.

The movie begins with 3 guy friends on a joy ride somewhere in the hills around (what I believe is) Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  The guy on the hood is Nathan Price (Taylor Lautner--the American Indian boy/werewolf) from the Twilight movie series).  They head over to a party, drink, and have a good time.  Nathan wakes up the next morning, passed out on the lawn.  His father comes to get him, followed by a slug-it-out on the lawn learn-how-to-take-care-of-yourself very physical ""discussion"".  Mom pretty much stands by and watches for awhile until she finally breaks it up, which seems a little odd for a mother, since these are some pretty good punches.

We next see Nathan in the office of his therapist.  Dr. Jerry Bennet (Sigorney Weaver) has been seeing Nathan for quite some time.  He has some anger issues (where it sounds like he blows his cork) and repetitive dreams of a woman being killed.  First, the pretty woman is singing to him, and then she is attacked and killed by a man dressed in black.
All and all, things are relatively fine. He loves his parents; they seem to enjoy each other and Nathan seems like a pretty normal teenager.  He also seems to like the girl across the street, Karen (Lily Collins).

When the Sociology teacher pairs Nathan and Karen together on a 10-page report and they begin researching ""Missing Children"" on the web, Nathan discovers his own photo.  He even has the shirt in the photo.  When he contacts someone on the website to find out more, the xxxx hits the fan.  The contact in New York, reaches out to someone in London.  To say that things ""heat up,"" fast becomes an understatement and the CIA is also involved.

Again, this is an action/chase/spy type film and quite good.  I was between a 4 and 5 star on it, so I rounded up.  As a few reviewers mentioned, there really was no chemistry between Nathan and Karen.  The movie was quite entertaining and I will most definitely watch it again.  Since this is movie about killing, I do not recommend it for your children.",1317513600,,2260,4.581047381546135
