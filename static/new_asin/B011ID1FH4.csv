I would have also liked to see more bonus items. But it's awesome to see this look like an actual film, as opposed to just a television movie. Prince Edward Island never looked more beautiful on screen! I have added photos. These are photos taken of the t.v., and not direct screen shots.",1448323200,84,456,4.573170731707317
7332926,5,B011ID1FH4,"If you are a die-hard Anne Shirley fan, and have become disillusioned by the recent ""improvements"" made to the Green Gables canon, then there is a light in the darkness.  The first book has been lovingly portrayed in gorgeous anime, and is the CLOSEST version to the book that I have ever seen.  There are moments when Anne's imagination takes flight (such as when she is describing how she would have slept in the cherry tree) and we are treated, just for a moment, to seeing how the world looks through Anne's eyes.  My copy of this film is in Japanese with English sub-titles; PLEASE, PLEASE don't let that keep you from enjoying it.  Every line, every feeling comes through with such depth and clarity that the movie could be in gibberish and you would STILL get sucked in. This film actually made me cry.

7332935,5,B011ID1FH4,"Blu ray quality:  Are you wondering about the blu ray transfer?  Is it worth purchasing?  As one who is very concerned with how a film looks, as I have been building my blu ray collection (I have over 2,000 movies), here is my take:

Cropping:  First, yes, the image has been cropped on the top and the bottom.  As a purist, I do wish that the full image had been preserved.  I would rather have black bars on the sides and see the entire image as filmed than to lose part of the image on the top and bottom simply to fill my HD widescreen TV.  I always prefer to own and view a movie in its original aspect ratio.  And yes, when I originally saw Anne of Green Gables, it was in the 4:3 aspect ratio.

With that said, it is my understanding that the director himself re-framed everything for this widescreen presentation.  And, I must say that he did an excellent, excellent job.  I rarely enjoy cropped images, but this is one of those very, very, very rare exceptions.  There are no odd panning movements.  Even though I know part of the image is missing on the top and bottom, the image never seemed too close or too pressed in.  It very much ""feels"" and looks as if it had been deliberately filmed (originally) in a 16:9 ratio (even though I know this is not the case).  I never felt the sense of frustration like something was missing on the top and bottom (a feeling I often get when watching cropped images).  It almost looks like he shot this film with the hopes of one day framing it in 16:9.  So, IMHO, the new 16:9 framing actually works really well for Anne of Green Gables.

Image sharpness/clarity:  There is no question that the sharpness and clarity of the blu ray are a definite improvement over previous releases (either VHS or DVD).  In many, in many scenes, there is a significant improvement, like watching Anne for the first time.  It does not have that razor sharp look of better transfers, but it is a definite step up from the DVD, and in many places it is quite good.  I have no doubt that this remastered blu ray version looks sharper and clearer than the remastered DVD version.  In most places the image looks really nice, very watchable, even beautiful.  In other words, I don't think we're ever going to get a better image than this blu ray version.  Still, there are a few shots (not many, but a few) that are a bit fuzzy...but I believe these are likely due to the original film itself (perhaps a camera was not entirely in focus or the lighting was not maximized).  Also, Anne of Green Gables has always had (in parts) a soft, almost dreamy quality in how it was filmed.  However, I think it would be a mistake to skip the blu ray version for a few isolated shots (one of the worst being a shot of Anne and her friend Dianna on a bridge while Gilbert looks at them from behind a tree).  I just don't think we're going to get any better than this.  This image is, overall, quite pleasing and very watchable, cinematic, even beautiful for much of it.

Brightness and color.  The director deliberately darkened the image and bumped up the color to give Anne a more cinematic look.  Again, as a purist, I like things as they were originally filmed.  I would have liked the option of ALSO viewing an HD scan uncropped without color correction, however, again, the image does look really nice.  Anne used to be a bit too bright and washed out on the VHS.  In my opinion, as a purist, I actually think this is a visual improvement.  These more cinematic tones are more visually appealing, even it isn't the image we are all used to viewing.  I've actually come to regard this as a positive, because the film looks more vibrant, the colors are richer and the darker image is not too dark, but more cinematic.  Again, I would not miss buying this blu ray because of this.  It actually looks really nice.

So, in the end, I give this a thumbs up.  I would say this is a worth while purchase.  While I might wish a few things were different and while this isn't generally a razor sharp image, it is the best Anne of Green Gables has ever looked and well worth the purchase IMHO.  It is the most visually appealing presentation of Anne we have ever had and may ever have.",1508716800,8,4193,4.361757105943153

7332941,4,B011ID1FH4,"The Kevin Sullivan's version of 'Anne of Green Gables' has gone through various touch-ups and remasters through the years.  And I was there for each of them.  From VHS to Laser Disc, to DVD, to remastered DVD to HD DVD (kinda useless when you still remain with DVD compression) and, finally, Blu Ray.  Through it all I went from unimpressed to disappointed.  At one point I actually said aloud, ""This is the last dime Sullivan gets from me for a supposedly new, NEW, no-really-NEW-we-mean-it remastered thing that looks no better than it did on the original DVD...BEFORE the remaster.""  But what can I say, I have been a fan of Sullivan's 'Anne' since the mid-80's and seem to fall for it every time.  The sequel (or, as we know it in the USA, 'Anne of Avonlea') was also wonderful even if it made a mess out of the books (I hear Megan Follows had a temporary falling out with Sullivan over this).  The third one...sorry...a dud.  Anyway, here is my take on this Blu Ray edition for anyone who, like me, held out so as not to be disappointed again.  Let me say this now: GET IT.

Originally filmed for television, the original aspect ratio was 4:3.  But, times change and with the advent of widescreen and HD TV's, Sullivan saw to adapt his beloved tele-film to this ratio by forcing it to widescreen.  Personally, I am a purist and would have appreciated it to remain as it was originally envisioned.  However, I understand that Sullivan took great pains to pan the frame so as to lose as little as possible and keep everyone and everything important in frame rather than looking like they're right up to your face (which happens when many films are forced widescreen).  The result: if you never saw it before, you'd never know it was not originally widescreen.  I am no stranger to digital video editing, so I am sure it was a painful process for Sullivan.

Now, my BIGGEST pet peeve has always been the video quality of this film.  Always grainy, always weak, always fuzzy.  For a tele-film actually shot ON FILM and gorgeously so, this always pained me because there was no reason for it to look shabby.  Even the DVD remaster was ridiculous.  Many people have commented on this.  So, why would I bother getting a Blu Ray version that would most likely follow that trend?  I did not, for a long time.  However, Sullivan is releasing a massive box set with the entire thing on Blu Ray.  Since I do not care for the last two (sequel and prequel), I am not getting that.  I figured, why not get the original one on Blu Ray?  I am glad I did.  It looks really good.  Still not 100%, but compared to every single release I have seen, from VHS to Laser Disc to DVD (various releases), this is the BEST it has ever looked.  Sure, there is some grain here and there, and a little blur every so often, but overall, this is a huge update.  Some scenes actually look so crisp and clean I almost felt like I was there. There is some obvious digital tweaking and softening going on, which can make some things look almost waxy, but there is not a lot of it.

Some people complained that there are no scene/chapter breaks.  This is true...and it is not.  Yes, the menu only divides this into Parts 1 & 2.  However, there are chapter breaks. You can click back and forward any time you want.  All you have to do it remember where you left off time-wise and then go back there later.  Yes, I know, a Blu Ray should have given us way more than that, like the Blu Ray player actually remembering where we left off (this would be in the disc encoding), or actual scenes to select.  Sullivan seems to have skimped and saved on this, and it is sad.

Some people complained about the sound.  Sound is important to me and is part of what I do, professionally.  What can I say, it does not sound any differently than any other 'Anne' releases we have seen.  Frankly, I did not notice any issues.

To wrap this up, this release is not disappointing (finally). Yes, it could be better, but it is better than it has ever been.  It almost makes me want to get the remastered DVD's for 'Road to Avonlea' and I just might.  And I will definitely get the sequel when available on Blu Ray.  If you have been holding out (I know, this is a bit costly for a Blu Ray), get this, you won't regret it.",1492732800,21,4268,4.374045801526718

7332943,1,B011ID1FH4,"Anne of Green Gables is an amazing film, for sure, but the abuse that this film has suffered from the ""remastering"" is pretty depressing.

First of all, the image opens up some on the sides but also cuts some on the top an bottom. The image even has the quality that the film was zoomed into. But this is not even the worse part. Anne of Green Gables may not look at all ideal in it's original VHS releases, but the release is brighter and more colorful. The Remastered DVD and Blu-Ray have a lot of dark and green going on, probably color graded for this specific presentation to make it look more modern and thematic. For being remastered from original elements, its also lacking a sharpness and charm that remastered productions on film, when remastered to their fullest, offer. I bought this at the premium $42 price, which, for a legendary miniseries such as this one put out by an independent company and having undergone a surely expensive remastering process, was not an argument at all, but the presentation they finalized and approved comes off disappointing, almost making you question whether remastering it was worth it or not in the first place.

I would definitely stick to the original DVD release of this film. Is it in widescreen? No. Does it look like it was recorded off a VHS? Yes. But it's also presented the way it was originally presented and is much more watchable than this sloppy remastered edition!

I have not watched the other remastered DVD releases and do not plan to, but I'm sure the third in this series probably looks great remastered as it was released originally theatrically elsewhere!",1486944000,2,1624,4.711267605633803

7332967,5,B011ID1FH4,"This is a technical review of the blu-ray release.

If you are a fan, the blu-ray is a big upgrade from the DVD picture quality. About as dramatic as the picture quality improvement in the Star Trek TNG blu-ray release vs its DVD version.

The sound however, is a big disappointment for the blu-ray format. For reference, I have Oppo 105D, NAD Master pre, Sunfire multi amp, and Dynaudio 5.1 setup. The 5.1 remix sounds really artificial and hollow. One really has to wonder if they decided to spend the money to go back to film and transfer it to blu-ray why they didn't do the same with original sound tracks. I actually prefer the stereo as it is more natural sounding and has a nice analog warmth to it. It really is a crying shame that they didn't redo the sound in HD to match the upgrade in pictures.

All that said, if you are a fan of the movie, the picture quality upgrade along is worth it, despite the disappointing sound.",1469750400,11,934,4.38728323699422

Next you will loose some of the top and bottom information since this was originally shot and shown in 4x3. with that said, Sullivan did an excellent job in cropping the video where no heads are cut off. The picture itself is the best I have ever seen of Anne of Green Gables. not much in the 5.1 DD, but is very nice and clear. the colors are correct, very sharp there is some grain if you look extremely close, but I am sure that is the way it was shot on the 35mm print. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars as there is no chapter stops, the ending of part 1 has been reedited to say intermission instead of the end titles, originally shown over 2 nights on PBS and Canadian TV the end titles over both nights where there and on my DVD Older Version.
