3963226,5,B002OPZ2X4,It's VOLBEAT do I need to say more one of the best bands around right now and live they don't disappoint,1301097600,,104,4.0
3963227,4,B002OPZ2X4,"I would have given this Double DVD a Five star, but for one reason.
The editing of the first live footage. The camera stays about 2 seconds on each spot & then goes to another for another 2 seconds, etc... Also there is too much footage of the audience in it. When I go to a concert I am going to watch the band & not the audience, which I couldn't in this instance, it is the same for this DVD.

When I buy a music DVD I expect to see full performances of the band while they are performing. Maybe the audience quickly once or twice during a song. It felt like being under a strobe light bouncing from one place to another every 2 seconds. It was too difficult for me to follow & watch. And then putting the audience in every 2 seconds took away from the live performance. I want to see the band and not the audience performing.

Footage of the audience should be kept to after a song & when Michael the lead vocalist is interacting with them, like when he does his crowd surfing & speaking to them. It is fine as well to show the audience only & I mean only once or twice while the band is in operation.
I was so truly upset at not being able to see full song performances by this band that I really love & waited so long to see on this DVD here in the USA, that I cried. I was sooo disappointed.

Actually the fans that tape their own footage of the band at youtube do the best, they keep their camera right on the band. You know why, because they are fans and tape what they like to see. You ask any fan of a band if they had two choices what they would choose, footage of the audience or the band in question?

Would Michael rather see a video of Elvis performing or his audience? A shot of Elvis for 2 seconds then the audience for 2 seconds & it goes on throughout the whole performance.
How about you Jon? Would you like to see footage of the Ramones doing a number or shots of the camera bouncing from one place to another.
There is no joy in this at all.

When you guys do another DVD, please remember this is how a fan sees it. We want to see full performances & the camera not jumping from one place to another constantly. It needs to be focused longer on each band member too.
It is alright to show the audience participation a couple of times during a number & when the band is interacting with the audience, but don't over do it.

Now the greatest thing was the second interview DVD of the band, even though I can't get the subtitles to work, brand new Samsung Bluray player, it is probably a bug in it. Da*n Japanese technology!
Anyway, this DVD lets you get up close & personal with the band members & their Entourage of helpers. That was worth every cent. Best $12.50 I've ever spent!

I am lucky enough to be able to travel a distance to see them perform live here in the state of California in Aug. 27th/2010. Maybe Michael can dedicate a song to cheer me up, I will save 'A Garden's Tale' for my funeral, but for the show, let me see, how about 'Soulweeper', 'So sad, so frantic', for that is what I felt when I saw the first DVD.",1277942400,2,3051,4.100502512562814
3963228,5,B002OPZ2X4,"Volbeat Sold Out Tattoos. Cadillacs. Pomade. Rockabilly. Heavy Metal. Yes, to many- one of these may not seem like the others but in the Volbeat camp they make a more than perfect union as evidenced by album chart climbs, sold out concerts and tours with the likes of Metallica. Volbeat, the Danish metal music wonder continues to grab the metal world by the musical jugular which is captured in awe-inspiring detail in their first DVD release Sold Out. Foreshadowing the dvd was the world's response to their second cd release ""Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil"" . It's colossal explosion in Europe (entering the Danish music charts at number one) was the bottle rocket that landed Volbeat on nearly every musical radar. ""Rock the Rebel/Metal the Devil"", was no flash in the pan aberration --staying in the top 5 ranking for five months. Propelled by this reception, Volbeat went out on their second European tour throughout the rest of Europe and captured the event during the entire run of the tour in 2007. The first dvd captures shows featuring 19 tracks at 10 different concert locations while the second dvd is a two hour documentary that charts their meteoric rise from national metal heroes to established stars in the heavy metal circuit, just in case you were unsure after seeing the footage from the first DVD. What ""Sold Out"" manages to achieve is what so many music dvds miss and that is putting the viewer front and center minus the occasional body surf. Granted, it is never easy to make someone feel they are actually ""there"" but ""Sold Out"" transcends the3D world it was filmed in and whether you are a fan or a novice , you will find yourself swept up in the mania with the rest of the fans. Covering nearly their entire catalog up till that point, the dvd also pulls, a rather unusual win with the songs that are featured. Instead of filming one show from beginning to end, ""Sold Out"" captures a tour and the variations a single song will have from one stop to another. Skewing being repetitive, this approach actually is rather distinctive and for die hard Volbeat fan, its the answer to ""please may I have some more?"" Equal video time is given to each member which makes the viewing less about Poulsen and more about the band. Granted, as the astonishing voice of Volbeat, he gets plenty of camera time and the documentary gives you more insight to what makes this band tick like a time bomb with Poulsen holding the match. Last but not least, the video quality of ""Sold Out"" is a great illustration for the quintessential concert dvd- camera shots are spot on, the sound is clear and mixed well and there is an almost perfect balance between crowd and stage shots. The only thing missing is the technology to transport the viewer into each show, but ""Sold Out"" gets you as close as possible.",1272412800,12,2810,4.667338709677419
3963229,3,B002OPZ2X4,"This was an awesome dvd from what I could watch. It doesnt work in the USA region tho and if it does, you still don't get the full experience.

I had this once before and something happened to the other DVD, I believe the one disc got ruined or went missing from when I was moving.  Bought this new and it arrived very fast, so that made my day.  I recommend buying this DVD, you won't be sorry.  The documentary part is great!",1336262400,2,327,4.295081967213115

3963248,5,B002OPZ2X4,"If you're a Volbeat fan, you NEED this DVD.  It features a collection of performances from different venues during the course of a summer, then put together as one long concert movie.  If you've ever seen Volbeat live, you remember the energy and the style eminating from their performances.  The DVD completely captures that energy, and brings you to their level.

Definitely check it out!  It also comes with a documentary about the band, which is also cool but at the end of the day you'll just be thankful you have some live Volbeat on DVD!",1307404800,7,544,4.625
3963249,5,B002OPZ2X4,"I know this came a few years back but this dvd is massive.  What a great band.  Yea the camera jumps around a bit too much on the outdoor portion of the dvd, but the rest of it is well worth the $$$.  I saw them live this year and yes this will hold me over until they come back around.",1306972800,10,286,3.6557377049180326
