6567407,5,B00MBAM6OA,"This movie is absolutely superb! The love story and the lesson are great. This is more of a dark love story with both redemption and revenge. It is the story of saving one person's life at the cost of another. It shows the agony of loss and the hope of tomorrow, but all in all it shows the love and peace of forgiveness.",1417478400,7,321,4.111111111111111

8671359,3,B00MBAM6OA,"The movie starts with Aisha (Shraddha Kapoor) calling her husband and leaving a message for him. A mysterious man in a hood breaks into her house, murders her with a screwdriver, and throws her out of the window. At her funeral, CBI officer, Aditya Rathore (Shaad Randhawa), points out to the police, that it is vital to track down the murderer or else Guru Pratap Singh (Sidharth Malhotra), Aisha's husband, would go on a killing spree. He misguides Guru by blaming Guru's former boss, a gangster Caeser (Remo Fernandes), for killing Aisha. In a flashback, he reveals that Guru used to work as a hitman for Caeser. Two years back, Guru had mercilessly killed a young man in a fit of anger, in front of his mother and younger brother. She told Guru that one day God would make him pay for all his crimes.

Guru meets new Aisha, a free spirited girl in love with life, who requests him to help her with reuniting two aged lovers. They soon become friends and Aisha reveals to him that she is suffering from a terminal illness, and tells him about her bucket list. Guru helps her fulfill most of those wishes but her health deteriorates. Falling in love with her, Guru marries Aisha. He tries every means to save her. She receives treatment in Mumbai and miraculously recovers. Few days later she discovers she is pregnant but conceals the fact from Guru. In a parallel story, Rakesh Mahadkar (Riteish Deshmukh) is an unsuccessful and henpecked man who is constantly nagged and ridiculed by his wife Sulochana (Aamna Sharif) for being useless and poor. He vents out his frustration by murdering women who speak rudely to him, and Aisha turns out to be one of them.

In present day, Guru aims to track down Aisha's killer. After finding out that it was not Caeser behind the murder, he finally tracks down Rakesh, while he is assaulting another victim. Guru beats Rakesh brutally but later admits him to a hospital and pays for the expenses, intending to return. While at the hospital, Guru finds out that Aisha was pregnant which makes him even more angry. While assaulting a nurse who had earlier spoken rudely to him, Rakesh is again intercepted by Guru who almost kills him, but revives him again after delivering an adrenaline shot and sets him free. Meanwhile, the police finds out the truth about Rakesh and takes his wife for questioning. Rakesh goes to his friend Brijesh Yadav (Kamaal R Khan), who suggests that Guru must be the husband of one of his victims and is thus taking revenge. He realizes that Guru is Aisha's husband as she had begged him not to kill her by saying that she is pregnant.

Rakesh, who now knows Guru's identity, taunts him over the phone before killing Aisha's father, and then surrenders himself to Aditya. Rakesh expected Guru to kill him so that he would become a ""hero"" in the eyes of his wife and everyone else, while Guru would become a ""villain"". However, Caesar calls Guru at that moment and says that he has killed Rakesh's wife and asks Guru to finish off his son. Enraged, Rakesh injures Guru and is about to kill him when he is run over by a car and dies on the spot. Guru later adopts Rakesh's son instead of killing him, and completes the remaining wishes on Aisha's bucket list.",1467590400,,3226,4.616724738675958
