8080948,3,B000AYNG16,Just be aware: this book is much more about new thoughts about geometry and geography than it is about the Holy Blood-Holy Grail/Rennes-le-Chateau mystery.  Louis J Sheehan,1197849600,,172,5.37037037037037
8080949,2,B000AYNG16,"I personally found this DVD rather boring. The first one-third pretty much summarized what I already knew from other books and DVDs on this subject. Then Henry Lincoln goes into a rather technical question about the location of Rennes Le Chateau among other places important to this subject, and its relative location to each other.

I wish I had saved my money.",1142899200,5,362,4.838709677419355
8080950,4,B000AYNG16,"Have to disagree with the previous reviewer - maybe not exactly what was expected, but informative and great to find there's something more behind the old Da Vinci Code stuff. The main player here is Henry Lincoln himself who made the original BBC programmes 30 years ago and wrote Holy Blood, Holy Grail - of course if it were not for him, there would be no Da Vinci Code - he's the daddy and this is the original story PLUS what he's been up to in the last 25 years.

OK, I perhaps woud have liked a bit more about the Priory of Sion, etc. but that's made up for by the new stuff that Lincoln's discovered since - I haven't seen this new Templar geometry stuff anywhere else - it's quite convicing and spooky.

I found it a thought provoking well-made and professionally produced DVD, maybe slow in bits, but there's alot to get your teeth into. Don't get it if you're looking for 'the answer' though - Lincoln seems to be saying ""there isn't one ... yet"".",1135123200,7,958,4.346368715083799
8080951,1,B000AYNG16,This documentary was horrible unless your a mathematic genius and get off on geometry. I was looking for a simpler movie explaining The Da Vinci Code or the Knights Templar. This offered no information. Instead it gave a 2 hour geometry lesson that made absolutely no sense. Just a couple of guys who were too smart for their own good jumping to conclusions. Please don't waste your money on this. This has very very very minimal information about the details of The Da Vinci Code mystery.,1135123200,5,489,4.6976744186046515
8080952,5,B000AYNG16,"If you're looking for a 'definitive' explanation or confirmation/debunking of the Da Vinci Code, this DVD may disappoint. But what's completely refreshing is that this goes back to the source of the whole story - Henry Lincoln and the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau. We get to find out - from the horse's mouth - how the original story was discovered and why, 30 years on, that same story (which first appeared in 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail') still has the power to inflame controversy. What's so disarming though - and you get to hear it straight from the source - is that even the originator of the whole cycle HIMSELF warns against BELIEVING in the 'Holy Bloodline' hypothesis. As he says (in the excellent bonus interviews in the EXTRAS section), it doesn't matter whether WE believe it to be true, what matters and is really of interest is whether people in the PAST believed it to be true and acted upon it.

It's surprising how swiftly and deftly the whole basis of the Da Vinci Code story can be dealt with when you go back to the source. You start to wonder what all the fuss is about. But if you've no idea of how the story got started then Lincoln's tale of his discoveries and his dealings with the Priory of Sion is fascinating.

What's more astonishing is that this DVD reveals for the first time a new story beyond all the Holy Bloodline, Priory of Sion and Da Vinci Code stuff. Basically Lincoln has spent that last 25 years (since writing `Holy Blood, Holy Grail') investigating something that Dan Brown never mentions in the Da Vinci Code. Beyond all the Mary Magdalene ""was Jesus married"" question, there's a real and verifiable phenomenon that demands explanation. Hidden in the countryside around Rennes-le-Chateau (the place in the South of France where the whole story started) there is an enormous pentacle and series of precise geometric forms, miles across, described by the positioning of churches and other landmarks. These same designs have also been found on a small island in the Baltic Sea which has connections with the Knights Templar. This is what the makers of this DVD seem concerned might get missed in all the fuss around Dan Brown's novel. It seems to me that what the previous reviewer found irritating - the posing of a new challenge rather than another theoretical explanation for what's already known, is actually a more honest approach. And for the viewer, much more engaging.

I also think this DVD is good value. There's a healthy dollop of extras - additional interview extracts with Lincoln and Erling Haagensen (who discovered the geometry in Denmark and has since collaborated with Lincoln), Lincoln's take on the impact of DVC on the little village of Rennes-le-Chateau, plus various informal interviews, out-takes and commentaries.

.

My criticism would be that the title of this DVD hides its real intention. Yes, we get to look at the real `origins' of the Da Vinci Code, but this program goes way beyond that brief. Rather than feeling cheated, I think this new material gives a completely refreshing aspect to a subject that is becoming a bit worn. Highly recommended for those who want something authentic and for those who are looking for fresh insights and material.",1135036800,9,3222,4.829710144927536
8080953,2,B000AYNG16,"This dvd took ten to fifteen minutes worth of substantive material, and stretched it out to almost an hour and a half.  It almost drove me insane as the narrator slowly droned on and on, taking forever to get to the point.  And then, at the end of the dvd, you find that there is no point.  The entire dvd can be summed up by saying that there were some places in Europe that made an amazingly accurate use of sacred geometry in their design.  Anyone with a basic knowledge of this subject will be wasting their time with this video.

If this had been condensed and used as the introduction to a more substantive discussion of relevant material (the knights templar, the freemasons, etc), then it could have been really good.  The only way it holds your attention is by constantly making you think that all of this information is leading to a point.  Instead, it spends 80 minutes dribbling out information, and then at the end basically says, ""well, someone needs to figure out what all of this means.""",1130716800,4,1003,4.50828729281768
