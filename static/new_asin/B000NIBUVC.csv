2768963,5,B000NIBUVC,"Heartwarming and fun story.  Season 2 continues the story Keichi and his Goddness Belldandy.  The second season starts off right and really touches on their relationship.

Characters:  I love all Ah my Goddess Characters: Keichi, Belldandy, Urd and Sculd.  Urd is like a big sister who always given Keichi great advice and help him with Belldandy.

  The season also started to build on Belldandys love for earth and Keichi.  I think this is the sweetest anime made.",1178841600,4,466,4.9480519480519485
2768964,5,B000NIBUVC,"When people usually hear of a sequel to a very popular series, many people cringe because of the anticipation that it will not live up to the first.  But this is not one on them.  The series starts shortly after the Lord of Terror incident with Osho (the priest who left on the pilgramige)returning to the temple with all new ideas and beliefs, then 2 minuntes later starting a new one when he runs into one of the famous Urd VS Skuld arguements (the fact that he was still standing after what he got hit with shows he is made of sterner stuff than he lets on).  and the hilarity keeps going from there with Keicheii getting a call from ""HIM"" to Bell getting drunk from a can of cola, with all the warm and tender moments you have come to expect from the series.  Old fans should really enjoy it, but new watchers should DEFINATELY watch the first season before getting into it.  With a hauntingly beautiful new opening and closing songs to the voices of the original cast make it a must have for any anime and Goddess fan.",1178841600,2,1023,4.335078534031414
2768965,5,B000NIBUVC,"Before I start my review, my recommendation would be to watch the first season. That way you can have a better understanding of the relationships between the characters. I will break down my review by episodes that are on the disc. Also, I will try not to give away too much of the story (AKA Spoilers) Now onto the review:

Episode 1

After the Lord of the Terror that ended season one, Yggdrasil (Heavens Computer) has lost information on the contracts (or wishes) that were made...including (you guessed it) the contract between Keiichi and Belldandy. And for the first time ever, Keiichi decides to ask out Belldandy out on a date. During the course of the date, Keiichi and Belldandy reveal how much they care for one another.

Episode 2

Its that time of the year were you give presents to the ones you love (Christmas) and everybody is happy...except Sayoko, aka The Queen Of The Campus. Sayoko starts to realize that while she has the power to make every man on the campus bend to her whim there is one guy that won't-Keiichi. So Sayoko (in some twisted logic) decides to try and win Keiichi away from Belldandy (I won't go into detail, but the way Keiichi disrespects her is beyond funny. My friend said it best: instead of one shot, one kill he does many shots leading to overkill). On the other side of the island Belldandy is knitting a special present for Keiichi. She explains to her sisters Skuld and Urd that the act of knitting symbolizes (to her) that you are weaving your love into every strand. After some events that lead to BellDandy's getting her gift stolen and Sayoko having a moment of clarity, Keiichi receives the gift.

Episode 3

Keiichi is in a bit of a jam. See, since Belldandy gave him a gift and has spent nearly a year with him, he wants to return the favor. Unfortunately, like most guys, the gift he wants to give her costs a lot and he doesn't have enough cash (sound familiar fellas?). So being the man that he is, he decides to get a job so he can have the cash to get her gift. What is unique about this episode is Keiichi tells Belldandy that for the next week he will be coming home later then usual and don't wait up. Belldandy (in typical fashion) says okay. The reasoning behind this is Belldandy trusts him fully and isn't worried about him cheating (she explains more), but more worried about him being hurt. Urd overhears about Keiichi plans and decides to pitch in. Surprisingly, she actually acts like a friend to Keiichi and gives some sisterly advice to Belldandy. Near the end, Sayoko makes an appearance and complicates matters for Keiichi.

Episode 4

Keiichi wonders if it is alright to keep the love of the Goddess to himself. While attending Sayoko's Christmas party, Belldandy takes her first sip of coke, and something unexpected happens. Keiichi finds himself in pursuit of a goddess who decides to spread the love of a goddess all about town.

All in All, I would say that this series is off to a very good start. But again, if you haven't watched the first season, you might be a tad confused on why a Goddess would be with a human :}",1178755200,9,3099,4.519642857142857

Thanks a bunch! (^_^)",1420416000,,60,5.1
8177838,5,B000NIBUVC,"""Ah! My Goddess"" will always have a big place in my heart.
  Being an old school anime fan, the original OAV's were quite special and the storyline of the manga and the anime series was well-written.
  The story is about Keiichi, a student at Nekomi Institute of Technology  (or NIT) was in his dorm because his sempai told him to wait for a phone call.

  While waiting, he got hungry, so Keiichi called  out for some food.

 He dialed the wrong number and got the ""Goddess Helpers"" office instead.

  A young cute goddess named Belldandy appeared out of the mirror and said ""Our job is to help people who are in trouble, like you.  I can grant you one wish, no matter what it is..."".
Keiichi replied, ""I want you to stay for-
ever"".
  This is the storyline as Keiichi and the goddess Belldandy try to do whatever they can to be together no matter the odds.

  To help the couple are Belldandy's sisters, the sexy older sister Urd and the younger intellectual sister, Skuld.

  The series is based on a manga by Fujishima Kosuke and serialized in Monthly ""Afternoon"" from Kodansha, Ltd.

  Over 23 volumes of the manga series have been published in the U.S. and every animation adaptation has been a big hit.

  The OAV series came out back in 1993 (from AnimEigo) and made the series a major hit among anime fans in the early 90's.

  ""Ah! My Goddess"" was then shown on television in 1998 (although the characters were super-deforrmed) and in 2005, it became a TV series titled ""Aa Megami-sama: Sorezore no Tsubasa"".

  The first season was released in the US by Media Blasters and the second season is now being released by ADV Films.

  In the second season, Keiichi and Belldandy's love for each other is being tested.

  Most of all, Keiichi is getting closer to showing his true feelings for her and trying to gain the courage to show her how much he cares for her.
  The first episode features a problem with the Goddess system and the contract binding Keiichi and Belldandy together has been lost.

  The next episode continues to test the couple as rich girl, Sayoko (who likes Keiichi) will do whatever it takes to get closer to Keiichi, even if it means doing terrible things to Belldandy.

  Needless to say that it's such a great feeling to have the popular series continued and released in the US on DVD.

  With the planned TV debut on the Anime Network set for May 3rd, the DVD release is planned for release on May 8th.

  Volume 1 features commentary by Eileen Stevens (Belldandy) and Drew Aaron (Keiichi), clean opening and closing animations, production artwork and ADV previews.

  ""Ah! My Goddess"" is an anime title that has always been about great storytelling and continues to be a wonderful romantic comedy anime series for fifteen years and still going strong.

  So, far a very strong start for the second season of the series and looking forward to watching more of anime's awesome couple of the year, Keiichi and Belldandy.",1218326400,,2953,4.61747572815534
8177839,4,B000NIBUVC,"I've collected the manga series and have the first season of Ah(or Oh)! My Goddess.  The second season seems to start off a bit slower or a little awkward I find.  It improved further into the season.

I enjoy this series because it's never really too serious and it's entertaining.  I like the characters as well as how they are drawn.",1201910400,,336,4.459016393442623
8177840,5,B000NIBUVC,"The adventures of our favorite couple continue as the wish is renewed and a rival is forced to question her own motives. It's just another look into the lives of these wonderful characters that proved so charming in season one. The production quality is superb, as usual, with a new theme song and opening credits to further enhance the experience. The new dvd producers don't have quite the same kind of functions in their dvds as the first seasons, but I didn't find it to be a serious problem.
I can only say that all is well, and moving nicely in the world of the goddesses. If you've followed this series so far, keep on going. I think you're going to enjoy the trip.",1193702400,,672,4.42741935483871
8177841,4,B000NIBUVC,"The computer that controls Heaven has been reset but some of its data has been corrupted or lost. Included in some of the lost data is the contract between Keiichi and Belldandy. Keiichi soon gets a call from God telling him that he and Belldandy don't have that much time left together. The two lovers accept their fate but Urd and Skuld aren't about to let it happen without a fight. They busily set about retrieving the fragements of the contract still left in the heavenly database. The main antagonist in these first episodes is not a demon or other supernatural being, but Sayoko, the spoiled rich queen of Keiichi's college campus. For the life of her, she can't figure out why Keiichi prefers Belldandy over her. I mean, she's got looks, money, and popularity. Unfortunately for her, she's going to find out that these things alone cannot attract a good man. In fact, she's extremely jealous of Belldandy and probably harbors an attraction for Keiichi that she would never admit to herself. When Belldandy knits a sweater for Keiichi, Sayoko goes nuts trying to outdo her. When Sayoko holds a Christmas party, one of her objectives is to outshine and publicly humiliate Belldandy. Sayoko is beginning to realize what it is she's missing: innate kindness. But due to being around Keiichi and Belldandy, she still has a chance to change.

If you can get through one of the most horrible anime theme songs ever recorded in the opening credits of this second season, you'll be gladly surprised that the quality of the show itself hasn't decreased at all. There's just something about Belldandy blowing on bagpipes that grates on the nerves. I really like the fact that Sayoko's character is getting more screen time and is being allowed to evolve. In the first season she was portrayed as a shallow, vacuous shell of a woman, much like Paris Hilton. But in these episodes she attains some depth and gets a bit of enlightenment about facets of her own personality that threaten to ruin her life. The comedy bits were just as funny as usual and Belldandy even lets her hair down when she gets drunk on cola and starts doing rampant acts of goodness! If you liked the first season, definitely continue with the second season.",1182124800,,2226,4.751937984496124
8177842,5,B000NIBUVC,What a great start to a second season. I can't wait to gett all of the series,1181520000,,77,3.588235294117647
8177843,5,B000NIBUVC,"It's as if they went back to OVA saw why we love it so much. The gentile love story is back in season 2 and I am happy to see it. Ah My Goddess was my reintroduction to amine after years away and I have always love it.

get the TV season 2 thee won't be dispointed!",1181520000,,265,3.6491228070175437
8177844,4,B000NIBUVC,"The story picks up where it left off in season one after the Lord of Terror wreaked havoc in Keichi's hometown. After the LOT's defeat it's aftermath affected Keichi's contract with Belldandy (the contract became deleted) so in order for Belldandy to stay with Keichi, Keichi must remember exactly what he said when he first met Bell in order to activate the contract. if not, Belldandy will be forced to take the stairway to heaven and stay there forever.

Ep 2: 'Tis the reason for the season to celebrate!...except for Sayoko, whose reputation for campus queen recedes her rivalry with Belldandy. Being the daughter of a very wealthy CEO, Sayoko is often the center of attention, especially with the hopeful bachelors that often shower her with lavish and expensive gifts in order to date her. Frustrated and irritated with the goddesses, who show her that money can't buy everything, she sets her sights on Keichi in order to make the holidays a bit less painful, instead she gets to experience Keichi's unique ability to put his foot in his mouth and act like nothing happened. Amazing. Oh, and Belldandy makes something for Keichi for Christmas, to show her feelings for him, but it goes missing and it's up to Belldandy to find out who the culprit is and return it in time to surprise Keichi before the day ends.

Ep 3: Keichi wants to return the favor to Belldandy by giving her a ring for Christmas, but he's broke and the gift that he wants to give her costs $2000 bucks. With Christmas only 3 days away, watch how he manages to get the money (with some divine intervention) and surprise belldandy before deadline. Special guests include Sayoko and Hijiri. Will Keichi get the ring? and will the ring rule them all? watch and see...

Ep 4: Keichi and Belldandy receive an invitation from Sayoko to attend her party in her lavish mansion with the most powerful members of the Mishima group, pretty harmless, right?...WRONG! Keichi and the gang go to her party, and to everyone's surprise Sayoko still has a grudge with Belldandy and takes it out on her by making Bell take the spotlight on the stage in order for Sayoko to show off her talents and put Belldandy down, only to backfire on Sayoko. Hilarity ensues. Then to Keichi's surprise, even though alcohol doesn't impair Belldandy, we find out what REALLY does, it's pretty funny. It's up to Keichi to keep her out of trouble, but can he prevent Belldandy who is (literally) drunk with power from using it?

Just like season 1, season 2 is off to a slow start but it will get better as the plot differs from the manga a little bit. We'll get to meet new characters (a new goddess is one of them and one of my favorites) and revisit old ones, as well as new obstacles to Kei and Bell's relationship. Voice acting is real good, a great improvement from the 1st season. Extras include: Trailers, voice actors' comments on the first episode (really worth listening to!), textless opening and closing (for those that like to make AMV's) and character drawings.

Overall expect this season to be an exciting one. Even though the boxed set will come out later, this is something that fans of romantic comedy should not miss. And for those that downloaded the series before it even came out, shame on you!!! buy this asap. trust me you will be doing all of us a favor and encourage anime companies to come up with more great titles for everyone to enjoy. Thanks and have a good day.",1180483200,,3437,4.627868852459017
8177845,5,B000NIBUVC,"Where oh where to begin? This is the first volume of the second season of the animated series based off of one of the most beloved romance/comdey manga of all time. Well first off a few warnings. First off if your new to the franchise, do not buy this one until you've become familized with the franchise or you'll be completely lost. And second to those who like and anime series to follow the manga it's based on word for word, you won't like this. For everybody else, the Goddess are back and better then ever.

Now for the actual review. The series picks up right where the last left off, the clean up after the Lord of Terror incident. The flow is nice and shows none of lag found in the mangas and keeps Keiichi and Belldandy's relationship rolling. I for one am very happy to see that the director is moving things along much faster then the manga. Mean their relationship has come along as far in the number of episodes as it had manga. Though this does mean a considerable trimming of the side stories and romances though given the opening not for long. Also they've reworked certain stories that I really don't know who they are going to fix the damage, the hand in hand story arc is completely wrecked unless they pull off some magic. Now on to something beside story line reorganization commentary. The music is just as wonderful as the first time around and the voice acting in both lanuages are spot on and every character sounds exactly as you imagine the would. The art is even better then the last time, the elongated faces are gone allowing for the character designsto really shine, i.e. the goddesses actually look as beautiful as goddesses. Though Keiichi still has elephant ears. Everything in the series is fluid and smooth. The series innocent, charming and warm feeling is back in full force with moments and scenes that you can't help but smile fondly at just remembering them.

In the end if you're a fan of the franchise or the previous series be certain to pick this one up. If not go back and pickup the rest of the series and then get back to this one, trust me you want to check out this franchise.",1179619200,5,2129,4.4704370179948585
