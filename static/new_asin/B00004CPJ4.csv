7919900,5,B00004CPJ4,I've watched this on lifetime and would really like it if it were available on DVD for purchase. When is that going to happen?,1461715200,,126,4.291666666666667
7919901,5,B00004CPJ4,"Susie and Fritz were my 2nd cousins. The story is very true. The movie did a great job, but the book Bitter Blood by Gary Bledsoe, on which it is based, contains a wealth of details that aren't included in the movie. You might enjoy it, too.",1426118400,2,241,4.148936170212766
7919902,5,B00004CPJ4,Anita L. Smith.  I too am waiting for a release of this movie.. I recorded it on my HR from Lifetime but I know because of all the commercials some of the movie had to be cut out..I would really like to watch this movie without the commercials and see the movie in its entirety.  Hopefully some day,1381881600,,298,4.120689655172414
7919903,5,B00004CPJ4,"This moving and true story, absolutely shattering, is available nowhere. I was furious when I worked late last night and discovered it had been running for the last hour and a half on Lifetime. Not that seeing them on Lifetime is any great shakes, what with their enormous pink logo filling half the screen. But it's better than being lost for all time. Who owns these great true crime films? I can name two dozen I've been looking for that just aren't out there, or maybe you can find an old VHS. Good luck. As time passes and tech on machines changes, they tend to be crappy. One last warning: I recently stumbled on several, including Deliberate Stranger and Nutcracker, available through a Warner Brothers site. Got them and discovered they can only be viewed on a DVD machine that CAN'T record. How many of those are there? I have one in my van. And what in hell is the reason, not to mention getting away with selling them (seen a few on Amazon) without warning anyone. Others, like my Amazon DVD of Small Sacrifices, are amateur dupes virtually unwatchable. Would start a write-in campaign, but no idea who to complain to.",1364342400,,1129,4.594059405940594
7919904,5,B00004CPJ4,"""In the Best of Families"" is one of the best made for TV movies ever. I cannot believe it hasn't been put on DVD. As a North Carolina native, I remember when the events were taking place. I really wish it would be formatted for DVD.",1346198400,2,232,4.065217391304348
7919905,5,B00004CPJ4,"I see lots of other posters here are having trouble tracking down this movie, so I hope they caught it on LMN last night, because they ran it twice in a row.  It's well worth the four hours of viewing, because it's a tragic and heartbreaking story about two very selfish people who will stop at nothing to get their own way with tragic results.  I love Keith Carradine, and he was great as the frustrated father of his two boys trying desperately to get them away from his crazy, self-absorbed ex-wife and her creepy gun toting first cousin.  The measures these two take to keep the kids away from him are blood curdling and beyond creepy.  Kelly McGillis was so convincingly wretched as a major bee-otch that I just wanted to slap her rediculously coiffed head a good one several times.  Harry Hamlin was just plain disturbing and gave me goose bumps.  And those poor little boys!  It wasn't bad enough she was abusing them before the divorce, but God knows what they were subjected to once old cousin decided HE was their daddy now.

If you want to see a true story that will have you angry and frustrated--and I am not giving away the ending--check this one out, although the movie is actually called Bad Blood after the book about the case.  You will not be able to believe the depths of cruelty two people will resort to in the warped name of what they perceive as love.",1329436800,4,1375,4.446215139442231
7919906,5,B00004CPJ4,"I have been searching for this movie on VHS or DVD for some time now.  This is one of my favorite movies, although it's hard to believe that situations such as this exsist in family life.  I was so touched and moved to tears by watching.  If anyone can advise me where I could purchase a copy of this movie please contact me at Neetina@aol.com.  Thank you.",1327795200,4,356,4.268656716417911
7919907,5,B00004CPJ4,"I have this on VHS that I recorded from Lifetime. Have been looking for the DVD but haven't found it yet!  It is an excellent movie though Kelly McGinnis plays a real ""B"" as does Harry Hamlin!",1294012800,7,192,4.1891891891891895
7919908,5,B00004CPJ4,I've been looking for this movie on lifetime - haven't seen it in years. I know it's morbid but the movie was incredible and depressing... just wanted to see it again. I'm fascinated by true crime stories and this one really hit me in a very soft spot.,1264118400,6,252,4.270833333333333
