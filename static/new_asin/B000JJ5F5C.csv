8150605,5,B000JJ5F5C,"Excellent historic documentary ,based on Paul Hoffman's book,  about the charming  invetor,pilot , balloonist and adventurer Santos Dumont . Santos is regarded as the inventor of airplane , by most brazilians , since he was the first man to design , build and fly a heavier than air  engine-self-propelled airplane , making it's first flight in front of a great audience which included international press , industry and business tycoons and comonn people in a pre-determined date and hour, taking off with no extra mechanical aid of any kind. And all this on the most romantic scenery of Paris - France and in the most romantic times , between the late 1800's and early 1900's. Wings of Madness is a great tribute to this historic character and aviation pioneer .",1382572800,,764,4.861538461538461

8150607,5,B000JJ5F5C,This documentary on Alberto Santos-Dumont the Brazilian aviation pioneer is an excellent work on Santos-Dumont's life as a pioneer of aviation. Santos-Dumont the biggest Brazilian hero after Tiradents (Joaquim Jos da Silva Xavier) really deserves that documentary on his work as an inventor. 2006 is the year of Santos-Dumont 100th birthday and that documentary came out just in the right time. I love the photography and the historical facts on Santos-Dumont madness to fly. Excellent reproduction of the 14 BIS flight by a Brazilian admirer of Santos. So bad they use a voice with a French accent not with a Brazilian accent. Santos-Dumont mother language was PORTUGUESE not FRENCH. If you don't mind hearing a Brazilian speaking with a FRENCH ACCENT not with a PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE ACCENT you will love this documentary. Excellent!!!!,1167350400,9,836,5.293233082706767
