3526268,5,B001D68NF4,"Shout brings us another volume of great and funny Sonic fun, I can't wait to watch the final volume. As I watch this set I see and remember so many of the episodes.",1348099200,,164,4.0
3526269,5,B001D68NF4,"Getting this Volume in was a thrill for me. I remember watching this when i was growing up around the age of six. The comic humor in this volume is better then the first volume. I have now watched through this volume at least a good four or five times now and no matter how many times i watch them, they make me laugh each time. Watching these also makes me wonder, ""Where has time gone?"" This volume is by far the best of the three and its a shame that it is off the air. But in any case, this gives good clean humor for all ages. I would recommend this to all Sonic fans.",1328659200,,573,3.9482758620689653
3526270,5,B001D68NF4,"If you need a good laugh, this cartoon is for you.

So funny!",1287532800,,61,3.6923076923076925
3526271,4,B001D68NF4,"This is a show I used to love as a 90's kid, so I wanted to see how it held up with time. First of all, it's crazy. Really, really crazy. If you want something more serious get the Sonic SatAM box. The real fun in watching this is gathering a few friends and trying to comprehend the wild inconsistencies that happen left and right.

Most of the best episodes are centered around Tails, and in an early one he's trapped inside a small room. There is a roof, and a ceiling light falls on him in this scene. A few minutes later he decides to fly away, through the (now nonexistent) roof. The robot named Grounder has hands that change to flesh, drills, or robotic hands between shots without explanation. Whenever a crowd gathers some of the creatures that show up look like hot dogs, the planet Saturn, or unidentifiable small humanoids. I highly reccomend this season, since it's fairly cheap and most episodes are watchable. If you like making fun of bad movies, this provides a similar experience.

WARNING- In the episode ""Zoobotnik"" a space woman bounces on Robotnik's belly while hearts fly out from their point of contact. So there's that.",1264550400,,1145,4.607843137254902
3526272,4,B001D68NF4,You most likely would buy this if you used to watch it as a kid. The animation and writing is a bit lacking but the voice acting is top-notch. Robotnik alone makes these DVD's worth it.,1245110400,,185,4.166666666666667
3526273,2,B001D68NF4,"when I had recived the 2nd volume one of the 4 disk was missing, I want a new one that has all of the disk. when I had orded Volume one I got all 4 disk. why was a disk of volume 2 missing ????? I hope something is indeded to be done about this.",1243555200,,245,3.4727272727272727
3526274,5,B001D68NF4,"this season is certainly a step up from season one. It comes with more action, jokes, drama(?), you name it! I would very much recommend this show to anyone who appreciates fine art. The visuals aren't the best, but they have a certain touch of artistic charms.",1230336000,,261,4.574468085106383
3526275,5,B001D68NF4,"We are very excited that Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog Volume 2 is coming out on December 9, 2008. Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog Volume 3 gets released in 2009 that everyone will get to complete the 1990's Sonic The Hedgehog Cartoon series collections.

8291854,1,B001D68NF4,Show is lame but fine.  Previews show scenes from movies eating people.  I bought this for younger children and expected age appropriate previews.  NCircle hasn't responded to my messages and calls.  Do not purchase if you don't want your kids seeing PG-13+ things.,1490140800,,265,5.093023255813954

8291859,5,B001D68NF4,"This is the second volume of The adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, the bonus feature for this DVD set was how to draw Dr. Robotnik. Unfortunately the DVD I ordered was missing the fourth disc. This is a must have if you own volume 1 and are a fan of Sonic the hedgehog. Even through I am disappointed that I only got three discs, I am still giving this a 5/5 because I am a big Sonic fan.",1390867200,,388,3.9871794871794872
8291860,5,B001D68NF4,Netflix did not show all ep of the show so i decided to buy the whole series and it is worth it !,1388880000,,97,3.260869565217391

First off, the DVDs play just fine and you're going to like the show if you liked the show at a younger age... I think they'd still be great for kids these days; lots of little good parenting lessons brought up within and it's a charming show with a bit of humor.  I think it's way past cool; physically, however, I'm fairly certain the product was used. (possibly just a case of bad luck or a simple mistake on the sellers/shippers end)",1385942400,,929,6.864406779661017
8291863,5,B001D68NF4,"I remember watching this series with my brothers and sisters and have forgotten what a joy watching these episodes bring me. Even older I still enjoy them, my one grip is the special features: I thought that it would have interviews with the vioce actors. I was hoping to see an interview with the guy that play robotnik, but oh well.",1382400000,,334,4.491803278688525
