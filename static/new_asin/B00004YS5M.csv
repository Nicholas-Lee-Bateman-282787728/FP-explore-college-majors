1377931,3,B00004YS5M,"If you're a big-time slasher buff who's not too hard to please, GRADUATION DAY is a good way to spend the afternoon watching. The kills are good and the heroine is likeable. (The plot has already been described by Amazon and by other reviewers, so I won't bother repeating them.)

However, there is one thing that really upset me watching this that in itself knocks this reveiw down one star, that is the opening introduction by Lloyd Kaufman before the movie itself begins. While talking about the film he rather callously says,""This film is ahead of it's time! It came out nineteen years before the Colombine shootings!"" (I swear to God I'm not making any of this up.) To so causually mention a real-life tragedy in such a careless manner I felt was in such extemly poor taste. The movie itself is fine, but be warned about the introduction.",1100563200,6,843,4.657718120805369
1377932,1,B00004YS5M,"""Graduation Day"" is a horrible horror film released in 1981 featuring Vanna White before ""Wheel of Fortune"".  This film explores the life threating moments and mischief of the track team.  A few months ago, one of their sprinters (Laura) was killed during a track match due to a disorder caused by overexercising.  Now, somebody in that town is furious.  He or she seeks rage by committing a chain of murders.  Until the killer is revealed, he/ she will not stop until the rageful ""needs"" are met.  Until then, everyone is a suspect.

Though its plot has some entertaining moments, most of it turns in unnecessary ways with turn of events.  Therefore, many of its scenes don't relate to the overall main plot.  These unnecessary events make the overall plot very slow moving.  Granted, some of them create suspense.  However, they could have been created in more useful styles.  Certain frequently featured aspects are unoriginal, namely drug use and upper body nudity.  Had the writers researched the subject matter more, the film may have resulted in better quality.  Many of these actors often do not convince audiences that their characters feel as expressed.  Many of them instead unintentually act intoxicated.  Though the screaming is excellent, a great film requires more than that.

Those looking for a great horror film should not watch ""Graduation Day"".  This film is sure to bore many audiences.  Those people are instead recommended quality horror films ""Halloween"" (1978), ""Psycho"" (1960), and/ or ""Scream"" (1996).",1099526400,,1528,5.113360323886639
1377933,1,B00004YS5M,"This is about some high school track team members who start turning up dead.  As far as ""atmosphere"" goes, it's much more of a '70s movie than an '80s one.  The characters range from banal to absolutely detestable.  The pace is plodding.  There's basically no plot at all, even by slasher standards.  A little T&A, which just makes you notice how poor the picture quality is.  The soundtrack is a joke, it actually sounds like you're listening to an old album.  There's hum throughout, and snaps and pops all over the place.

There are a couple of interesting scenes, but that's about it.  I was really looking forward to this movie, I mean, an '80s slasher with girls on the track team.  But it took me three tries before I even finished watching it.",1098057600,4,751,4.537313432835821

Theres a masked killer murdering teens, but it doesn't have the actual fun of F13's or the scares of the ""Halloween"" series. For the most part, it's pretty boring, in the same way ""Prom Night"" was, but even more so. Theres a TON of boring build-up, with teens and teachers having conversations, and stuff. The kills are pretty lame, too. However, it's not completely bad. It's actually pretty well made, and the directing is pretty good. You also get to see some cool clothes and hair from the early 80's, which was very enjoyable for me. But, again, it's mostly a snoozer, but it really doesn't deserve less than two stars. I sort-of reccomend it...",1088726400,14,756,4.649253731343284
1377935,3,B00004YS5M,"""Graduation Day"" is an obscure yet interesting little slasher film. The movie doesn't really offer anything we haven't seen a million times before, doesn't really do anything spectacular with its miniscule budget, but it is an enjoyable movie nonetheless. I was a bit surprised to see Troma--those purveyors of abysmal cinema--distributing the DVD version of the film. I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised since Lloyd Kaufman occasionally recognizes he must give the public something worthwhile to balance out the junk that constitutes the bulk of the Troma canon. ""Graduation Day"" came out in the early 1980s during that halcyon time when slasher films ruled the roost (and the box office) thanks to motion pictures like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and Sean Cunningham's ""Friday the 13th."" Most of the films attempting to cash in on the success of the splatter genre faded into obscurity. Thanks to the advent of DVD, we can now see both the good and the bad entries in this memorable cinematic movement. If that means we must turn our eyes to Troma to do so, then so be it.
""Graduation Day"" starts with an opening sequence so cheesy, so horrifyingly awful to behold, that it almost made me turn the film off. Imagine, if you dare, the camera panning across your typical high school track and field event. Since the film takes place in that painful gray area between the late 1970s and early 1980s, most of the people we see look so geeky that even Bill Gates would have stigmatized them. Feathered coifs, lame T-shirts, lots of smiles caked in braces, and a background song with a decidedly disco motif that had me grinding my teeth into powder nearly sent me running to the local mental motel. As bad as the first five minutes of ""Graduation Day"" is, there truly is a method to the madness. We see a young girl beating her feet around the track, straining to pull into the lead and finish first as her testosterone drenched coach roars her on to victory. The girl does win, but she collapses and dies immediately after crossing the finish line amidst roars of shock from the crowd. It turns out the hapless young lady trained so hard to compete in the race that she ignored her deteriorating health, as did her domineering coach. You just know after seeing this unfortunate incident that someone will seek bloody revenge for the now dead girl.
Someone does start turning the student body into mincemeat shortly after the track and field fiasco, with special attention paid to the other members of the track team. We know this because the killer, who is some doofus clad in a sweatshirt with a hood, has a team picture of the track jocks he holds up to the camera every chance he or she gets. Every time the murderer offs one of the dead girl's teammates, he draws a red 'X' over that person's face in the snapshot. The kids die in various tepid ways. One of the girls dies in the locker room, one jock gets his on a trail running through the dense forest behind the school, and one girl dies outside of a party at the roller skating rink (!). I would like to tell you the kills are memorable in a way that puts all other slasher films to shame, but I won't lie to you. The whole slice and dice situation is quite mediocre for the genre as a whole. Several subplots take up large segments of the film, such as the put upon principal dealing with angry parents, a geeky music teacher who sleeps with his female students, and the sister of the dead girl who arrives home from the Navy to confront her angry stepfather and the apathy of the student body. The overbearing coach gets screen time too.
So why is ""Graduation Day"" a memorable film possibly worth viewing? Maybe it has something to do with the in your face early 1980s atmosphere. Check out that party at the roller skating rink. Man, oh man is that scene about as close as you can get to a time warp back to the days of early MTV, New Wave music, and Valley Girl speak. The band banging away in the background alone should give anyone who lived through that time a serious case of the flashbacks. The presence of Linnea Quigley in one of her first screen appearances also speaks well for the film, or maybe not depending on your views. The best element of the film, however, is the warped conclusion. Up to the end of the movie ""Graduation Day"" just sort of meanders along, not quite sure of itself, but the film takes a dive into the depths of weird when we finally discover who has been dispatching some of the locals. The atmosphere and the conclusion helped ""Graduation Day"" when nearly every other element failed to deliver. Why, for example, is there a kid walking around in a football uniform at the end of the school year? I thought football season ended before Christmas. Sometimes it is better to avoid such pesky questions and instead focus on the positives.
Since Troma Films released ""Graduation Day,"" you can expect a boatload of lame extras typical of every Kaufman and company disc. This one has an interview with Linnea Quigley, trailers, a lousy sketch on how to stage an arm dismemberment, and a shameless plug for Kaufman's book about filmmaking (By the way, if you need to learn how to make a film from a guy like Kaufman, you should probably keep you day job flipping burgers.). Give ""Graduation Day"" a chance if you like slasher films. Sure, there are films with more gore and better atmosphere, but there are also worse ones than this movie. What a ringing endorsement, eh?",1080259200,19,5466,4.595701125895599

1378025,3,B00004YS5M,"I'm one of those slasher film enthusiasts that just has to have a decent collection of good editions of these films. ""Graduation Day"" was one of the few that slipped past my radar so I, in the end, blind bought it based on numerous positive reviews which also made a point of how good it looked and sounded.

It's not all bad but this is one slasher that is in the bottom tier. There's no suspense and the build ups to a kill are awkwardly staged and the red stuff is, unwisely, sparingly used. The quite laughable red herrings are so obvious that they basically provide the film's real laughs and comical scenes fall a bit flat.

Spoilers ahead:

This is, however, one of those slashers that has a sympathetic villain that has a reason, albeit a deranged one, for his killing spree spurred on by loss and tragedy. Not wanting to have just a faceless enemy systematically hacking his way through just anyone; there's a method this person's madness (and a very clunky use of a stopwatch! - but it has it's purpose). In the end it's all pretty sad; but seasoned viewers will most likely have guessed who long before.

There are a few inspirational touches here and there; a beheading that comes out of the blue, Linnea Quigly does what she usually does in a horror pic and a minor shock moment that's well played out in the end.

End of spoiler.

Performances are pretty lacklustre but Christopher George is always likable, even when playing a not so likable character. Overall; ""Graduation Day"" will only appeal to slasher film fans but this fan was a little underwhelmed.

The Blu-ray is good; a/v quality is good (no subtitles though) and the extras are informative. Brings it up a star.",1452297600,4,1688,4.588039867109635

1378063,5,B00004YS5M,"Graduation Day is a great 1981 slasher and has lived the test of time. When reviewing slasher films one must take in note a lot of slashers have the same plot but also must add their own spin to survive the ongoing releases of slashers especially in 1981 which is a golden year for the subgenre. Graduation Day is an underrated film in this slasher it was shuffled for the bigger hits that year as was Final Exam in my opinion. The cast is great in this film too. The late Christopher George of City of the Living Dead and Mortuary headlines a young cast which includes early screen roles for 80's scream queen Linnea Quigley and even a young Vanna White! The opening credits had some of the funniest music I ever heard. I was not expecting to hear that in a horror film, but it gives you a happy feeling till it stops then the story takes a change to the worst. Really dark characters in this film too. The ending I did not see coming I actually jumped a few times. This had a few red herrings in it also that made you think who the killer was. The Blu-ray is amazing, this film has never looked better. Vinegar Syndrome has taking time and care for this film, the 4k transfer is pretty good.

I thought it felt lazy and dull and silly... but as I got older, my taste for cheese changed a bit, and this new Blu-ray really brings the film some new life. It looks GREAT. Thank you Troma for letting Vinegar Syndrome give this film a real re-release. I will say though that the sound leaves a bit to be desired. There's a lot of noise sometimes... like empty sounding. I can't really explain it. And occasionally, there are a ton of black and white specs on the picture. But overall, it's pretty great looking and sounding.
The features are also a pretty nice and informative treat. It's great to see the lead, Patch Mackenzie, is still pretty proud of this film since a lot of actors that were in these films kinda regret them.
I recommend this film to anyone who loves 80s slasher movies with a little bit of cheese. If you like fun horror films, this one is the one for you. The actors are actually pretty good for a horror film, and the death scenes, while light on gore, are pretty memorable.

I have seen several hundred slasher films and I feel that Graduation Day is fun, enjoyable, entertaining, and a standard slasher flick from 1981 (the height of the Golden Era for slasher films). I really cannot understand the unfavorable reveiws below. Sure it's not Friday the 13th or My Bloody Valentine, but it's a damn good slasher in it's own right. The cast is really decent and features genre favorites Christopher George and Michael Pataki. The acting is above average, no worse than other slashers from it's time. The dialogue reaks of typical 80's silliness, and I wouldn't have it any other way! There is a decent amount of kills and plenty of gore. And the movie has one of those crazy over the top twist endings like many other slashers from this time. Some people want to complain about how cheap the gore looks, well it looked good enough to me. There is one scene that's a little to dark to see some of the gory details, but that was not uncommon back then. I can't stand CGI, and many people simply have no imagination anymore. They would rather analyze every single frame in a gore scene from 1981, and then compare it to a contemporary film. This WAS ""The Golden Era"" for Horror and you can never recreate the atmosphere and feeling those movies had ever again. Sure I like some newer horror films too, but I don't watch a movie from 1981 and expect the same style of film that is produced today!

Graduation Day could have fallen into the trap of being completely irredeemable, but is actually a decent film.

The film starts off with the sudden death of a high school track star. From there, it quickly sets up a cast of characters - almost all of whom seem suspect. While the acting, murders, and general story might leave something to be desired, Graduation Day still holds itself together.

The best thing about the movie is the fact that so many characters are set up as being the possible killer. It's fun to try and formulate reasons for one being the real killer.

It also says the film is the Director's Cut.  The actual disc, however, is different.  The disc says 2009 (not 2002).  I assume it is an official Troma release because it has [...] on the disc.  The special features do NOT include the Kaufman intro or the Quigley interview.  I read another review here at amazon about Kaufman making a tasteless remark about Columbine.  Perhaps, this has something to do with it.  That's beside the point.  The DVD has been changed and this isn't noted anywhere.  I'm not even sure if this is the Director's Cut.  The quality is ok I guess, considering the budget and time made.  I'd even keep the DVD if this is all there is available.  I would have like to have known that it was different, however.

But then the character doesn't get killed, and that kind of bummed me out. There are a few good death scenes, though. My favorite being death by football sword (!). And there is some nudity here as well. One of the young ladies who shows her breasts is none other than 80's b-movie queen Linnea Quigley. I've seen Ms. Quigley in more movies than Robert Deniro, which says a lot about my taste in movies. Also, there's quite a few goofy moments and a few funny moments. I liked the scenes with the principal and his secretary. I also liked the ending. Still, Graduation Day could have used a lot more gore and a lot less filler, and maybe it could have been a classic instead of forgettable fare. As a side note, this movie grossed 23 million dollars at the box office, which is more than Prom Night, Terror Train, and several entries in the Friday the 13th and Halloween series.

1378093,4,B00004YS5M,"I am a die-hard fan of old school slasher movies of the early '80s and one obscure entry to emerge during this era was Herb Freed's (very) low budget gem ""Graduation Day.""

Filmed in the fall of 1980 near Pasadena, California (as a helpful Amazon user has previously offered) and released in May of 1981, this film is an archetypal teen body count flick, but done with just enough schlock and panache to always make for a fun viewing.  After all, slasher movies are not about chilling accurate portrayals of homicide, they're about hot young babes baring some skin, pot smoking, beer drinking and splatter.  ""Graduation Day"" thankfully has all those elements and an overriding campiness to it that shows it's not meant to be taken seriously.  This is pure trash in other words, the kind that the movie's distributor Troma Films has come to be known for.

All the girls here are really cute, and there is your standard hot girl undresses in locker room while unknown perpetrator breathes heavily and turns out the lights on her that succeeded in getting me aroused.

Included in the cast is an early appearance by legendary cinema trash queen Linnea Quigley, who plays your standard slutty track team member who shows her breasts to the really dorky music teacher.  Linnea looks slightly older here than some of the other students (she would have been around 22 when this was filmed), but looks hot, hotter than she did in '84's ""Silent Night, Deadly Night,"" and one of her contributions in ""Graduation Day"" is smoking a joint on school grounds with a fellow burnout and mocking the stuffy police officer that busts them.

Also along for the ride is Christopher George, who appeared in many a low budget movie in the early '80s (most notably other slashers like ""Pieces"" and ""Mortuary"").  Here he plays the stodgy track team coach who is always a suspect as the killer.  Is it him who has the hots for girls 1/3 his age and is cutting the throats of members of his team?  You'll just have to track down this rare flick and find out...

The 2005 Legacy edition of this DVD had gone out of print for some time and was selling in the $40+ dollar range here on Amazon until Troma thankfully reissued it again recently in 2009.  Sadly, neither edition has any special features worth mentioning, as I really have no interest in the parts about what Troma is producing today.  I was really disappointed to find out there was no retrospective interview with Linnea Quigley as I'd previously heard (who made that one up?), so for that reason I couldn't give this release a full five stars.

Still, very fun stuff.  ""Graduation Day"" passes with honors and no demerits if campy slasher trash from the golden age of the form is your thing.",1251504000,4,2726,4.659707724425887
1378094,2,B00004YS5M,"Ah the 80's. A good time for horror movie fans and CGI wasn't a factor in the movies, so everything looked real. This movie sounded like a winner. Of course, you'll never read a good synopsis followed by all in all this movie sucks. Troma owns this film and it fits them good. A track runner dies because well I never figured it out. The first kill takes awhile and the pace of the film is slow. The first kill was horrendous and it looked really cheap. There was only one real good kill and the rest of the film felt like it was too long and way to boring. If you like 80's film then maybe check it out but there is much better themed day horror films out there.",1232755200,,663,4.068702290076335

To all cult fans if you remember the toxic advenger this movie is done by the same people that did graduation day. Like it is presented at the begining the track runner student freaklishly dies when she races the other team. Her sister comes to vist the town area and the school where she goes. By that moment wierd murders begin to happen one by one each student is disapearing. There is a gym teacher involved (Christopher George)actor.and a strange guy student involved who was a good friend to the girl. So this goes on it gets you thinking ,is it the gym teacher or is it the student. Imbetween the film by  seeing every one students the principal who is a bit of character as well takes the audience us watching this film start to get a good idea who it is!

1378102,3,B00004YS5M,"It's almost Graduation Day at the local high school but something tragic has happened as a track runner died from a heart attack and a mysterious psychopath stalks members of the High School track team, almost anyone in the school is a suspect as one of them could be the killer.

Starring Christopher George (""City of the Living Dead""), Vanna White and Linnea Quigely, this is a fine paced and fun no-brainer slasher movie that is one of your typical ""Halloween"" clones. Yes the acting is bad, the killer does look like a Fencer and  the film does have some plot holes but this is an enjoyable killer movie with memorable kills like the man being skewered by a football with a sword in it and a good late 70's disco soundtrack.

This DVD contains a fair picture transfer with some miminal grain and decent sound and the extras include introduction by Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, interview with Linnea Quigley, Trailers to other Troma releases and more.

Also recommended: ""Halloween Series plus 2007 remake"", ""Black Christmas (1974)"", ""The Prowler"", ""Sleepaway Camp Series"", ""Scream 1 & 2"", ""Maniac (1980)"", ""Friday The 13th series"", ""Cutting Class"", ""Prom Night"", ""Terror Train"", ""Twitch of the Death Nerve"" and ""Urban Legend"".",1199059200,2,1232,4.966019417475728
1378103,3,B00004YS5M,"Another example of good, wholesome, 80s slasher fun.  As in most slasher films the motivation for the killings of course is revenge.  The incident in question is a track star who dies of a blood clot during a race in the beginning  of the film.  Soon, the members of the track team are being knocked off.  My God, who's behind it all?  Well, if you're really burning to know, you can either A) watch the film or B) read the previous review that has no hangups about spilling the beans for you all.  Either way, the killer's identity isn't really the big issue in a film like this(and it's not like you won't have figured it out less than an hour into the film anyway), but the fun of the journey.  Not much else to say about it, after all we are talking about a slasher film.  Although I did enjoy this movie more than most of the other reviewers here(I tend to watch these films for schlock value while most of these reviewers are comparing this film to ""Halloween"".  Remember, Troma reissued this, so don't go expecting anything Oscar worthy), I can't bring myself to give it more than three stars.  The Prowler is a four star slasher film in my opinion, and though I think this movie is worth checking out for fans of the genre, it's no Prowler for sure.  But it does have Christopher George, who horror fans may recognize from such tasteful horror romps as City of the Living Dead, Grizzly and Day of the Animals.  Probably the most amusing death here involves a jock who's thrown a football that's been fixed with a sword.  Good times.",1187308800,,1540,4.414893617021277

We also get Linnea Quigley (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, NIGHT OF THE DEMONS) as Dolores, a girl who just can't seem to keep her clothes on!

Christopher George would have made a good President of the USA; he had that presence to him, and though he more than likely didn't have the credentials to run the country (debatable, I know), he did make movies a more watchable commodity when he appeared onscreen.

So see this one if you can, I did and don't regret it. It kept me smiling throughout, and that's not easy to do in this day and age.
