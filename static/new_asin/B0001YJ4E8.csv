8280693,5,B0001YJ4E8,Trust me you don't want some video from the CDC like someone else reccomended.  Those videos are so boring and will not hold the attention of anyone trying to view them.  This video is very informative and interesting at the same time.  Lots of good information!,1115683200,,262,4.6521739130434785
8280694,1,B0001YJ4E8,"There are many FREE videos on smoking, how it affects your health, all geared towards teens, all available for free from the Centers for Disease Control.  If you have a big budget, I'm sure this DVD is OK, but why spend the money for things you can get for free?",1099958400,,262,4.24
