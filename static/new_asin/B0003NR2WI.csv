8035991,5,B0003NR2WI,"Fleischer Studios made the Betty Boop cartoons from 1932-1939, with Mae Questel (who was also Olive Oyl, Little Audrey, and Little Lulu) primarily as Betty's voice. All the episodes in this collection were directed by Dave Fleischer, and he appears in a clever part-live action sequence along with brother and producer Max in ""Rise to Fame"", and Max is also in ""More Pep."" The DVD finishes off with 2 more mid '30s entries from the Fleischer Studios. The Betty Boop episodes are in b&w, and the last 2 are Color Classics. Condition of the prints is good considering their age. Total running time is 67 minutes.

Episode list:

1: ""Betty Boop's Rise to Fame,"" 1934, no animation credits given. This is a fabulous cartoon, with live action sequences featuring Max and Dave Fleischer, and includes clips from previous cartoons, ""Stopping the Show,"" ""Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle,"" and ""Old Man of the Mountains."" Betty imitates Maurice Chevalier and Fanny Brice. 5*

2: ""Betty Boop's Crazy Inventions,"" 1933, animated by Willard Bowsky and Ugo D'Orsi. Songs include ""Keep a Little Song Handy"" by Sammy Timberg. Betty works in a trade show full of bizarre inventions, with Bimbo the dog and Ko Ko the clown assisting.  5*
