7919543,4,B00003TKZC,"Criterion's fully documented Robeson box covers his entire film career, 1925-42, with two of his UK films, plus the Kordas' SANDERS OF THE RIVER, the latter featuring the ""African-American Garbo"" Nina Mae McKinney. No less glamourously--but without Korda production values--Robeson was cast opposite the West End  theatrical legend Elisabeth Welch in these 1936-37 specialty projects made back to back for Hammer Films/British Lion. In both Robeson--singing riverine ballads and roots anthems throughout--is typecast as a docklands stevedore, the majority of songs were customized as trademark Robeson and Welch solos by composer Eric Ansell, and both films were directed by the art director J. Elder Wills.

BIG FELLA is the lesser followup film but has the more diverse score, with commanding Ansell showstoppers for Robeson and two torchy solos for Welch, including ""Harlem in my heart."" Miss Welch does not sing in her film debut SONG OF FREEDOM but this more interesting story has Robeson morphing musically from singing London docker to international opera basso to (singing) African tribal king. With anyone but Robeson this would be ludicrous, but the man is consistently magisterial in his film presence (whether singing or simply inhabiting film space, much like John Wayne), with abiding dignity and artistic integrity.

Robeson's earlier Korda project SANDERS OF THE RIVER offered a real surprise in the credits, with Jomo Kenyatta in a minuscule background appearance. SONG OF FREEDOM is even choicer as the credits roll: La Welch is carelessly misbilled ""Elizabeth"" (corrected for BIG FELLA), and this very musical programmer further includes in the cast Ecce Homo Toto (born Tony Wane), George Mozart and ""Miss C. Smith"" (less artily Ms. Cornelia Smith). These are actual professional performers, appearing for early pre-horror Hammer Films, and Robeson's colorblind benefactor/impresario in this script is called ""Donozetti"" [sic], this character feyly stereotyping Italian opera insiders.

Neither film is at all distinguished--even by Hammer standards--and each deserves three stars, but Welch and Robeson are historically important musical artistes, their remarkable performances lifting both films above the mundane. Both films were specifically styled as Robeson showcases, and viewers will find considerably more of his musicmaking here than in the Criterion box or the unbeatable and essential James Whale SHOW BOAT.",1475020800,,2439,5.655737704918033
