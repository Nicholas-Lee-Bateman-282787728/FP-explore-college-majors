8561979,5,B00B361FKY,"The best wrestlemainia.  No other wrestlemainia filled me with more excitement as a child and adult as this one.  Hogan vs Sid, Savage vs Ric Flair, the Hitman they are all here.  Great show, great DVD.",1384473600,2,202,4.555555555555555
8561980,4,B00B361FKY,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

WrestleMania made it's way to the Hoosier Dome in  Indianapolis, Indiana for this edition of the event which was the first time in history being promoted as having a ""double main event"".  The only celebrities involved with the show was Family Feud host Ray Combs & Reba McIntyre singing the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" while this was the WrestleMania debuts for superstars & legends like Tatanka, Sid Justice, Lex Luger (via satellite to promote the World Bodybuilding Federation) and Ric Flair.

This Mania was built up as the possible retirement match of Hulk Hogan as he faced off against Sid Justice in a match that's mostly remembered for the confusing ending that to this day was given a clear explanation & the aftermath that lead to one hero's return.  The other main event was for the WWE Championship with Ric Flair defending against Randy Savage but was more personal than that with Flair having pictures claiming he was in a past relationship with Savage's wife Elizabeth in what was definitely a classic emotional encounter between the two men that saw people from Mr. Perfect to Elizabeth herself get involved.  Another emotional match involved Intercontinental Champion Roddy Piper vs. Bret Hart in a match that got not only bloody but saw a different side of Piper in the ring as he adapted to Bret's technical wrestling style & did more wrestling than he's done in his entire run in the WWE.  Other matches include Shawn Michaels vs. Tito Santana, Undertaker vs. Jake Roberts, Tatanka vs. Rick Martel, Tag Team Champions Money Inc. vs. Natural Disasters, Owen Hart vs. Skinner, a entertaining six man tag match with Jim Duggan & Virgil & Sgt. Slaughter & Big Boss Man vs. Nasty Boys & Repo Man & Mountie, and an interview with the returning Legion Of Doom along with their returning long time manager Paul Ellering.

The first half of this event was the perfect WrestleMania in my opinion as it was a very strong card from top to bottom delivering everything as far as entertainment, in-ring wrestling, and emotion but the second half of the card really ended the show on a flat note with the bad booking & the ending to the main event being very confusing while looking back at how the show ended a year later coming off like a bad dream as nothing they set up for the future lasted long.  In the end, this is still one of the strongest of the early WrestleMania's so I recommend.",1364601600,5,2703,4.6976744186046515
8561981,4,B00B361FKY,"The Shawn Michaels-El Matador(Tito Santana) match was not great but good enough. The Jake Roberts-Undertaker match was simi-decent but no means a good match. The Intercontinental title match between Bret Hart & Roddy Piper was a back-and-forth,epic bout with great storytelling to boot. The 8 man tag team match between the team of The Big Bossman,Virgil,Sgt. Slaughter & Jim Duggan against the team of Repo Man,The Mountie & The Nasty Boys(Brain Knobbs & Jerry Sags) was pretty standard stuff but basically a filler. The World title match between Randy Savage & Ric Flair was a near-perfect,epic encounter. The Rick Martal-Tatanka match while not bad,it was just there to show off Tatanka. The World Tag Team title match between The Natural Disasters(Earthquake & Typhoon) & Money Inc(Ted Dibiase & IRS) was mediocre with a bad finish to boot. The Skinner-Owen Hart match was short and pointless. The Sid Justice-Hulk Hogan match was awful this side of WCW Starrcade 2000.  I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1362873600,4,1005,5.017964071856287
