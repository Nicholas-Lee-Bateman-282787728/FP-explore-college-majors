8207971,4,B000T68P8O,"This listing is for the first four DVDs in the Level 1 phonics set by Montessori House.  The material below describes in detail each of the four DVDs and is taken from the Montessori House website descriptions.

""Our material is created by certified, experienced Montessori teachers working together with award-winning children's educational animators. These four DVDs feature beautiful educational cartoons that introduce children to the sounds of letters, beginning words for reading, short animated stories so that reading becomes immediately useful and rewarding as well as beginning math skills.

The first DVD, Sounds & Words, introduces children to letter sounds and beginning words. Bouncing letters move across the screen, teaching children how to sound out their very first reading words. The words in this program are consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words such as cap, pen, big, fox, and cup. Short stories bring these words to life and enjoyable repetition reinforces key concepts. This DVD is based on the Montessori Movable Alphabet concept.

The second DVD, Make Big Words, reviews the CVC words from the first program and then introduces the most basic long vowel formation using an ""e"" in the middle or end of a word. Words such as cape, beak, rice, code, and mule are taught in this program. More difficult formations of long vowels will be introduced in our upcoming Level 2 series.

Fun & Great Math, the third DVD in the series, teaches children about counting and quantities from one to ten. Children also learn about beginning addition and subtraction using the unit one. Engaging animation and instrumental music bring the lessons together in a fun and engaging way. The concepts taught in this DVD are from the Montessori Golden Bead material.

The fourth DVD in the series, Big Vocabulary, teaches children how to sound out useful words that are too advanced for a regular phonics program. Words such as grandma, bicycle, and triangle are sounded out on the screen as the letters move in tandem with the voice. This program is wonderful for children who want to learn words very quickly or for children who need a lot of patient review. The foundation for this program is the Montessori Sound Combination Sandpaper Cards along with the Movable Alphabet.

Lively instrumental and soothing classical music make these DVDs very versatile for families because younger children have fun just watching these programs, while older children enjoy learning to read and count.""",1184889600,,2493,5.201995012468828
