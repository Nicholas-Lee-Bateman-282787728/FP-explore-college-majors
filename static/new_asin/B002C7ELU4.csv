3904928,5,B002C7ELU4,"Lee Strobel brings an excitement and enthusiasm to Christianity; that is not seen enough these days. If a former athiest can dig up this much evidence for God the Creator; the existence and works of Jesus and how He fulfilled Old Testament prophesy regarding the Messiah; and the compelling reasons for our Faith in God to be an important part of our existence, then everyone should be able to believe. If you are not sure of your Faith, or it seems to be in a rut... Watch these and renew the fire of your Faith. His arguments are undeniable and the evidence is real. It takes more faith to believe there is no God and that Darwin was right, than to believe the evidence that Lee Strobel presents. Weither you believe in God or not, WATCH THIS SERIES. If you didn't believe before, you will find compelling reasons to believe after watching this series, or at least start asking a lot of questions. I have been a born again Christian for 15+ years and this series renewed my excitement about being a follower of Christ. It is not about religion it is a relationship with the one who created us all, and Lee brings this to life. GET THE EXCITEMENT!! Watch this series.",1255910400,122,1168,4.488262910798122
3904929,5,B002C7ELU4,these movies are a really powerful witness to Jesus Christ. they are very in depth and informative. most of the info comes from doctors and professors who are being interviewed. they are a bit long to use as a teaching resource but they can easily be used in different segments.,1253577600,58,278,4.58

I viewed The Case for Faith and it was neither the full length movie, as was The Case for Christ, nor was it segmented, to go hand in hand with the small group Study Guide which has six parts.  After ordering this 3-some, I found a separate DVD that was segmented to play a portion with each chapter of the study guide.

3904993,2,B002C7ELU4,"I was disappointed in all three movies. Case for the Creator was fine if you are a science or philosophy student. Otherwise over your head.
Case for Faith was a lot of people saying the same thing over and over.
Case for Christ was another commentary with everyone saying the same thing. I guess I expected three movies similar to God's Not Dead 1 & 2.
Don't get me wrong, I'm over 70 years and been a Christian since I was 12 years old. I just expected more out of the DVD's than what I got. At this point I will probably file them away & probably never watch them again. I expected 3 movies not 3 commentaries.",1492905600,,612,4.194915254237288

I think when you get them, you should rearrange them. In my opinion :-) they're not packed in the right order. They SHOULD be:
A Case for a Creator
A Case for Christ
A Case for Faith
in that order
when you watch them, you'll see what I mean and more importantly..... why
But PLEASE buy this set. You will NOT be sorry

A well known non-believer journalist ends up proving to himself that God does exist. It's a great series to watch, especially with a non-believer or someone new in their faith or anyone still questioning if God is watching over all of us. There are 3 discs and each makes a case that there is a Christ that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, that you must have blind faith, and that God is our Creator. It's much easier to understand than reading the bible, but still, read your bible:)

3905103,5,B002C7ELU4,"When Jesus utters, ""My God, my God why have you abandoned me..."" He is quoting Psalm 22. The Psalm is a ""Messianic Psalm"" that describes the events going on around Jesus. Jesus uttered the first line, and anyone who heard it would have known the rest of the Psalm. It's like when some one starts to sing, ""God bless America... land that I love..."" You fill in the rest.

God does not abandon us at our hour of need. He walks with us and comforts us transforming our pain into a deeper faith in him. It's funny, but the commentator talks about God being with us in our pain, and then the next scene they talk about how God abandoned His own Son. That was the one part that did not make sense...

3905125,4,B002C7ELU4,"I give the entire collection of three DVDs slightly less than four stars, but I rounded up, because it is definitely better than three stars.  My breakdown is this: the first DVD, The Case for Christ, is about four stars, but not quite (i.e., not a solid four stars), The Case for Faith is two stars, and The Case for the Creator is a solid four stars.  Ill give my take on each of them.

The Case for Christ made a number of good points.  It got preachy a couple of times, and the viewer is given a lot of personal information that is more rhetorical apologetics than it is reasoned apologetics.  I think the producers of this kind of material intentionally sacrifice potency for dollars by appealing to a softcore Christian audience than appealing to the reasoning mind, which might not be made up or even oppositional and looking for content.  What I must say is that one of the strongest aspects of this DVD is that Strobel did a good job of creating a linear argument that stitches together historical points and textual points that point to the authority of the bible, or, at least, reasons for thinking it is likely historically accurate in a number of respects.  The because the bible said so line of argument is onion-paper thin without something like Strobels reasoning and evidence.  The weaknesses in The Case for Christ mostly reside in the typical anecdotal Christian testimony of salvation, which most non-believers find revolting maybe the DVDs function is to ensure people who are not saved remain unsaved, and the lack of notes made about what contests meet the points presented by the scholars interviewed.  Part of a great argumentative piece is to acknowledge strong points made by opposition and, then, subverting them, not ignoring them.

The Case for Faith was pretty much disgusting.  I could hardly watch it.  In effect, it was your typical series of scenes where there is some beautiful cloud present with music, and the viewer is just expected to revel in the Glory.  A minor decent point was made occasionally, but much of it was the flat-out putrescence of softcore Christian evangelism.

The Case for a Creator was by far the best.  They needed to go a little further, but they production team did a good job of interviewing folks who were knowledgeable scientists.  At one point, an interesting remark was made in refutation to the Urey-Miller experiment and abiogenesis, that, even with the contents produced in said experiment, one could additionally puncture a basic organism, allowing its contents to fill a sterile test tube, but none of those materials, the amino acids and additional basic life molecules, will not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, i.e., the mode by which self-organization would have occurred has not been explained.  There were numerous other basic creationist information presented.  This DVD contains the preliminary information and standpoint of the worldview, and they even brought in a couple of philosophers to give some explanations, which is only just, since, I think, it is philosophical interpretation, not science per se, that is at issue, here.  There were a number of scientists not consulted that are among the best expositors of the creationist world view, such as Berlinksi, Lisle, and Dembski, which could have made the DVD better.  They were probably excluded on the grounds that they generally have much more complicated and nuanced information to contribute than was necessary, supporting my point that the material preliminary information on creationism.  Like The Case for Christ, the content in The Case for the Creator lacks objections that might be presented by a scientist of a conventional philosophical interpretation of scientific information.

All in all, I cant recommend the whole set to serious content seekers, because only two of the three DVDs are worth watching.  The Case for the Creator is one that I can recommend to all, on the grounds that it conveys the basic information of the creationist viewpoint.  Serious seekers might be interested in The Case for Christ, if he or she can stomach the phony evangelical stuff and typical Christian testimony that is ever overly dramatic.",1419811200,,4183,4.985611510791367

3905146,5,B002C7ELU4,"Lee Strobel has the gift of being able to communicate ideas based on clear evidence and pragmatic explanations of facts. He eliminates opinion and conjecture from his presentations, and focuses on the truth, and nothing but the truth. No matter where it takes him. There are those like Richard Dawkins, who prefer not to examine the facts as Lee, and others, have outlined them. There does come a point where, even Dawkins cannot refute what is the obvious fact that happenstance could not have possibly produced life, as it is on earth. Only a Creator could have accomplished the amazing feat of life as we know it. The universe is clear evidence of His power to create. Gravity, the distance we are from the sun, and the moon. All of which are EXACTLY where they need to be in order for life to exist. Denial of these facts defies logic and reason. Using mathematics, Lee Strobel lays out the probability of Darwin's theories.

3905164,5,B002C7ELU4,"Good DVD set. Lee Stroble presents the same evidence from his books on the same subjects. I'm a visual learner and the DVD set helped reinforce what I read in his books. He's a very logical, rational thinker and approaches the evidence from that perspective, however, there is a bit more in-depth information in his books. Gives good info on why to believe - to have faith, to believe Jesus is who he claimed to be, and in God the Creator. Good for group study or sharing with a non-believer.",1407715200,6,492,4.477777777777778

3905187,3,B002C7ELU4,"Someone suggested to me that I get the book, ""A Case for Faith"", for my teen daughter who is seeking answers about the Christian faith. She doesn't like to read and buying the book would have been a waste of money but when searching for the book, I stumbled across the video, which has 3 different documentary style stories. I put it on, ready to watch it with her and she couldn't stand it. Had zero interest in it within 20 seconds.
The main character is a little quirky, a little to giddy, even for me. I had similar feelings but because I bought it; I chose to stick it out and it's a documentary in all aspects and not geared to draw in a teen or young adult. I think it's better suited for someone seeking knowledge of faith in their early 30s+.
Maybe my disappointment mostly comes from the let down feelings of the anticipated excitement upon my daughter loving the movie enough to be drawn to actually read her bible.",1397865600,6,926,4.358381502890174

3905199,5,B002C7ELU4,"The Case for Faith is superior to the the Case for Christ, in my opinion, because the logic is more uniform.  The first is fairly well-done, but I felt their consultants were biased and would have liked more objective opinions.  Also, there are points left unsaid that would have built a better case.  But overall, both are great resources.  I would recommend viewing The Case for Faith first and following it with The Case for Christ.  Will update after I watch the third.",1392508800,,473,4.650602409638554
3905200,5,B002C7ELU4,"From his legal and investigative-reporter vantage point, Strobel lays a sure-footed pathway from which to proceed in one's quest to answer the age-old questions about Christ, a Creator-God, and a sincere faith.  I have wearied ordering material ostensibly about such topics, only to find they are over-represented by 'theologians' who actually don't really believe what they're discussing!  Mr. Strobel actually started out to provide investigative proof against traditional Christian adherence to the deity of Christ and an allegiance to a Creator-God; however, his search increasingly began to convince him of the actual truth in the biblical accounts. If you are weary of the dishonest and shallow opinions of so-called religious experts who love to be consulted about precious truths that they run rough-shod over, then this series will prove to be thought-provoking, invaluable in establishing your own precious faith. Mr. Strobel ended up becoming convinced of the truthfulness of what he sought to disprove!  So will you.",1392163200,3,1028,5.535031847133758
3905201,5,B002C7ELU4,"I was similar to Lee Strobel, a non-believer in faith.  Like him, I decided to investigate and read these books first.  Like him, I saw the evidence that no other faith can provide, including atheism and agnosticism, and all other religions and beliefs.  I bought the DVD series to share with family, loved ones, and all others that will not take the time to investigate and read such books of critical importance, but might look at videos.  Only an absolute fool will not take three hours out of their lives to investigate the most important aspect of one's life.  It answers all the hard questions with evidence, not religious mumbo-jumbo.",1391990400,2,641,4.790909090909091

3905221,5,B002C7ELU4,"This is a fantastic DVD set to have for two reasons. The first is that if you are a Christian, your understanding and defense of God, Jesus Christ, and faith will be made stronger. The second is that these DVD's are around an hour a piece, making them a wonderful tool to witness to non-believers because more people are likely to watch something than read an entire book.",1378771200,7,372,4.485294117647059

Along his way, Lee took a very pragmatic approach which is documented in his book and now in this DVD - the great thing about the DVD is that you hear from many of the experts Lee interviewed along the way.

3905281,5,B002C7ELU4,"Aaron M. White (Sacarmento,CA) has an OUTSTANDING review + it is repeated here ...
""As in all books to film, the books of his go in great depth of his journey and investigation. But to see and hear the main points from those he interviewed, I insist you get these DVD's. If you don't have the time to read the books, I insist that you watch these DVD's.

The Case for Christ is probably his most personal. From atheist to Christian is a pretty big step. But before he took that step he looked for evidence. From the main points of the authenticity of the New Testament, was Jesus the Son of God and the biggest of them all, the Resurrection. Some people can come to faith by just hearing about Jesus from a friend or neighbor. Other people need facts and proof, well here it is.

The Case for Faith, is examining the faith of Christians and people in general. When questions come up to challenge your faith, do you break down or do you have a defense. This dvd is the defense. Why is there evil in the world, is probably the hardest pill to swallow, but answers are given. Maybe ones we don't like or want to hear, but they're in there. Is Jesus the only way to God and Salvation, that question is in there.

The Case for a Creator takes a look at the physical and created world. From our place in the galaxy in this mass universe all the way to our itty bitty cells. Darwinism is compared to creation. Like i said before, some people can come to faith by just hearing about God or Jesus. But, if you need even more evidence here it is again.

As before if you want more indepth research, read the books, but to get an eye opening experience buy these dvd's for a friend or even a family member. I would suggest depending on what type of person they are to either do The case for a Creator first for the scientific minded or for those spiritual seekers to do the Case for Christ. Either way leave the case for Faith last, give them time to find their own faith first before they come face to face with the hard questions. But I maybe wrong, just a thought. Plus buy these triple pack is cheaper than getting all three separately so ssshhh.

For those who are readers, check out The Case for the Real Jesus, the continuing investigation after the Case for Christ. Sorry this was long, but I hope it was helpful.""

Every one of his ""experts"" are Christians.  There are no objective opinions, no historians at all!  Pathetic.
Google ""Sun Gods"" and you'll find this myth resurrected (pun intended) over an over in history (actual history, not the bible.) There is no evidence of any messiah ever existing.  No miracles have ever happened and there is no god.  Christian holidays were all stolen from the pagans.  Do some real research, people.  Stop letting religion do the thinking for you.

The segment with Joni Tada was profound.  This amazing woman possesses wisdom I haven't heard in my nine years of University study.

She, as well as many of the other speakers, have the gift of explaining things that not only speaks to the brain, but also to the heart.

These movies are great.  The ""Case for the Creator"" was my favorite of the three but I'm glad to have seen all three. I passed the film collection along to my pastor after watching so that they would be available to others.",1287446400,,393,4.383561643835616
3905297,5,B002C7ELU4,This DVD collection is excellent and complements the books well. This is a great visual for the material covered in the books.,1285027200,,126,4.7727272727272725
3905298,5,B002C7ELU4,Used this with high school youth group.  Covers topics well.  Production is high quality.,1284681600,,89,5.285714285714286
3905299,5,B002C7ELU4,This is a good set of DVD on major apologetic issues. The DVD is professionally made and is good for strengthening believers' faith and for explaining our beliefs to others.,1278892800,,173,4.8
3905300,5,B002C7ELU4,A must have in a Christian home.  Wonderful for children and adults alike.  We cant speak loudly enough for the God of the Universe.,1278720000,,132,4.458333333333333
3905301,5,B002C7ELU4,"Lee Strobel's 3 DVD's are excellent, on many levels. As a journalist for a big city newspaper he investigated the claims of Christianity, and gave up his atheism, because he found belief in God, The Bible, and Christianity to be  credible. History, Geology, Archaeology, Genetics, Bible apologetics. These, and many other subjects are covered, and are not simply lectures. All throughout, are interviews, and video, from around the world. The bonus features on all 3 DVD's are awesome. Any (open minded skeptic) will find more than enough evidence in these DVD's to become a Christian, Bible believer. Close minded skeptics, or atheists; view these DVD's with this warning, (if you dare); you just might have to admit that you have been wrong: (because your teachers have also been taught by the blind). The bankrupt (theory) of evolution will no longer be your excuse for denying the existence of God, or the accuracy of the Bible. Hopefully, many souls will be saved through these DVD's, and through the work of the Spirit of God.",1278288000,5,1032,4.965317919075145
3905302,5,B002C7ELU4,"This dvd set is a must have by any Christian family. I have purchased multiple dvds of the Case for Christ and given it out to my friends. They can't believe how much historical, prophetic, and eyewitness proof there is concerning the Bible. The Case for Creator also shows the weakness of the evolutionist theory.",1276473600,5,314,4.7272727272727275
3905303,5,B002C7ELU4,"As a common thinking person and a Christian, I always found a way to rationalize evolution into God's plan. As part of God's plan. I was never presented with evidence, scientific or otherwise that did not have Darwin and Evolution as not part of the way Nature made things happen. After viewing these shows, the evidence is not disputable. You have to take a leap of faith to belive in evoution. Sad that the energies of so many of our youth is sadly looking for ways to take a Creator out of the process.  Very sad. Thanks Mr. Strobel.",1275091200,6,536,4.414141414141414
3905304,5,B002C7ELU4,"These videos are excellent! Lee Strobel lays out the facts that logically follow to the conclusion that without a doubt, God exists, and that Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead. Using logical progression, it doesn't take a leap of faith to believe in the existence of God and His Son, Jesus Christ. Everyone should watch these videos! Especially if you are questioning your faith in God.",1266969600,5,395,4.91044776119403
3905305,5,B002C7ELU4,"This package of three DVD's that Lee Strobel compiled is a near perfect mix of answers to everyday questions that Christians ask at times as well as non-Christians. I have seen other DVD's on DNA, Creation and Lee's first DVD's as they came one at a time. This is a package that I ordered and sent to our seven grown children and one nephew for Christmas. The comments already received made it more than worth the price.",1266883200,2,420,4.467532467532467
3905306,5,B002C7ELU4,"The first time I heard of this series was when I was browsing videos on YouTube. I watched The Case for a Creator in a 10 part series on IllustraMedia's channel, and was very impressed. I then went out and bought this entire collection when I found out it was at the local Family Christian Store. I must say that this series has changed my life. I have been comprehensively studying Christian apologetics ever since these films restored my faith in Christian apologetics. I used to think that most of Christian apologetics was ""Because the Bible says..."" or ""Just trust in God."" I am glad that I was proven wrong. Strobel and many other experts in the field offer sound reasoning and evidence in favor of a Creator, Christ, and faith. Recently, I started reading Stephen Meyer's Signature in the Cell. On Netflix, I watched Ben Stein's Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. This collection, mainly The Case for a Creator, was what started it all for me. Each video contains a number of special features in addition to the main feature. Note also that in all of the DVDs, Strobel provides a list of resources for further study, and sometimes trailers for his other works.

The Case for a Creator:

Main Feature: The chapters are as follows: (1) Introduction (2) Negative Evidence (3) Cosmology (4) Physics (5) Astronomy (6) Biological Machines (7) Biological Information (8) Credits

Each answer is roughly a minute and a half. (2) How Did Life Begin?: This 10 minute additional feature explores the impossibility of proteins assembling randomly. Stephen Meyer and Jed Macosko offer expert analysis. (3) The Machinery of Life: The viewer watches as the process of protein synthesis unfolds. Dean Kenyon offers closing thoughts.

The Case for Christ:

Main Feature: The chapters are (1) Introduction (2) Examining the Evidence (3) Analyzing Jesus (4) Researching the Resurrection (5) Lee's Decision (6) Credits.

Moreland, Mark Strauss, and Craig Evans speak on the first real individual, the meaning of the cross, the importance of his resurrection, a teacher unlike any other, the significance of His miracles, God's representative on earth, and the implications of His claims. (2) Faith Stories: Craig Blomberg, William Lane Craig, Craig Evans, Gary Habermas, Mike Licona, Michael Rydelnik, Mark Strauss, and N.T. Wright discuss their personal faith and ministry.

Overall, this series is without a doubt 5 stars.",1266192000,36,3703,5.171953255425709
3905307,5,B002C7ELU4,"As in all books to film, the books of his go in great depth of his journey and investigation.  But to see and hear the main points from those he interviewed, I insist you get these DVD's.  If you don't have the time to read the books, I insist that you watch these DVD's.

The Case for Christ is probably his most personal.  From atheist to Christian is a pretty big step.  But before he took that step he looked for evidence.  From the main points of the authenticity of the New Testament, was Jesus the Son of God and the biggest of them all, the Resurrection.  Some people can come to faith by just hearing about Jesus from a friend or neighbor.  Other people need facts and proof, well here it is.

The Case for Faith, is examining the faith of Christians and people in general.  When questions come up to challenge your faith, do you break down or do you have a defense.  This dvd is the defense.  Why is there evil in the world, is probably the hardest pill to swallow, but answers are given.  Maybe ones we don't like or want to hear, but they're in there.  Is Jesus the only way to God and Salvation, that question is in there.

The Case for a Creator takes a look at the physical and created world.  From our place in the galaxy in this mass universe all the way to our itty bitty cells.  Darwinism is compared to creation.  Like i said before, some people can come to faith by just hearing about God or Jesus.  But, if you need even more evidence here it is again.

As before if you want more indepth research, read the books, but to get an eye opening experience buy these dvd's for a friend or even a family member.  I would suggest depending on what type of person they are to either do The case for a Creator first for the scientific minded or for those spiritual seekers to do the Case for Christ.  Either way leave the case for Faith last, give them time to find their own faith first before they come face to face with the hard questions.  But I maybe wrong, just a thought.  Plus buy these triple pack is cheaper than getting all three separately so ssshhh.

For those who are readers, check out The Case for the Real Jesus, the continuing investigation after the Case for Christ.  Sorry this was long, but I hope it was helpful.",1264464000,318,2247,4.252955082742317

3905309,5,B002C7ELU4,Loved all three videos they really answered lots of questions I have struggled with for a long time.  Lee Strobel does a great job of walking you through his skepticism of Christianity to his discovery of truth.  Would highly recommend it for parents who need answers for their children's questions.,1258416000,12,299,4.96
3905310,4,B002C7ELU4,"I was overall happy with the DVD. I felt that the first DVD of the three was lacking facts that also helped prove the bible as devine. It did have some facts that supported that Jesus was a proven man on earth, but if I was a sceptic I would have remained one in regards to the bible. The second two though were very interesting. I am a believer and they had facts that supported my beliefs and ""cemented"" them, so to speak. Overall a good DVD to have in your collection and share with others, but not what I expected after all the hype (on BOT n such), so four stars, still great.",1257984000,2,581,4.105263157894737
