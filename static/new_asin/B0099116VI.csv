Other Good Matches

5278103,4,B0099116VI,"Team Mysterio (Rey Mysterio, Sin Cara, Tyson Kidd, Justin Gabriel, Brodus Clay) vs. Team PTP (Prime Time Players, Tensai, Primo, Epico): A Survivor Series elimination match, which was never announced making it a bonus match. I hate it when WWE doesn't announce the entire card. Especially one with a build up as Rey/Cara have been feuding with PTP for some time. All I can say is this is what an opener should be! The best PPV opener in recent years. i really loved the ending. But the whole match was fun.

Kaitlyn vs Eve - Divas Title: I didn't really pay much attention here. I like Kaitlyn's wrok as I think she's improving. Eve has been great as a heel. But something here just didn't seem right.

R-Truth vs Antonio Cesaro - U.S. Title: What I expected. Truth did some stuff here and there. But Cesaro was the dominant one here.

AJ/Vickie segment: The pictures AJ showed of Vickie with Brodus Clay & JR were quite funny for me. The real highlight here though was Tamina Snuka's impactful return.

Sheamus vs Big Show - WHC: I have really been enjoying this feud. Their match at HIAC and here were good. Sheamus has brought out the best of Big Show this year and Show turning heel was the best thing to happen to his career. The ending pretty much gave away the fact that a rematch was gonna be set to take place soon & it'll happen at this Sunday's TLC in a Chairs match.

Team Foley (Kane, Daniel Bryan, Kingston, Miz, Orton) vs. Team Ziggler (Ziggler, Sandow, Del Rio, Barrett, Otunga): Another elimination match. Loved it except for Kane's very early elimination. Best part? Tease for Orton's eventual heel turn. But really, it was a great match.

Ryback vs Cena vs Punk - WWE Title: I guess they felt Ryback vs Punk again would be too predictable so they added Cena to make it a 3 Way. Originally, I believe Cena was gonna face Punk at HIAC. But because of his injury, they did the angle where Ryback was chosen instead. I really like Ryback as well as a heel CM Punk. Punk has been great since 2011 as a face and since turning on RAW 1000, as a heel as well. But his heel persona got even better since he aligned himself with Paul Heyman, making me wonder what'll happen when Lesnar returns. Anyway, I liked this 3 Way a lot. The ending was it all the more better as it was totally unexpected. Three men from NXT (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) has been making an impact since first appearing here.

Overall, Survivor Series was better this year than it was in the last recent years. I think the last PPV as whole that was worth watching was, for me, 2000. However, this year's is worth watching from start to finish too. You might wanna skip Kaitlyn vs Eve though.",1355270400,,2692,4.437246963562753
5278104,3,B0099116VI,"It should be noted that Jerry Lawler returned to the commentary booth earlier in the week on RAW while J.B.L. is officially now a SmackDown commentator once again leading to a three man announce team with Michael Cole with everyone (including Lawler himself) making jokes about his heart attack weeks earlier. WWE would read The Rock's tweet in regards to the WWE Championship match throughout the night along with show Touts from fans about who would win since The Rock has the WWE Title shot at the Royal Rumble.

Elimination Match: Brodus Clay, Rey Mysterio, Sin Cara, Tyson Kidd, Justin Gabriel vs. Tensai, Primetime Players, Epico, Primo - A bonus traditional elimination match here with four established tag teams & two of the biggest men in the WWE that had various highlights such as the crowd not forgetting Tensai's past, the team work between the teams of Mysterio/Cara & Kidd/Gabriel, the Clay vs. Tensai showdown, and the standout performance of Tyson Kidd, and the finishing sequence. This was a hot opening match with good wrestling & high flying fast paced action with some flashy moves.

WWE Divas Champion Eve vs. Kaitlyn - Before the match, we almost had ""deja vu"" to Night Of Champions when someone tried to attack Kaitlyn with a blonde wig only to Eve just happening to arrive on the scene in time before both girls headed to the ring with Kaitlyn taking the fight to Eve right away using the wig as Eve tried to run away & even into the crowd. Eve was able to recover & focus on her head with a hangman's chinlock from the top rope & grounded head scissors before Eve took some nasty falls off the top rope & apron allowing Kaitlyn to try to attack with midsection including a version of the GTS except the knee went into the stomach. This was one of those matches where you can tell the girls were trying but some of the stuff wasn't clicking.

United States Champion Antonio Cesaro vs. R-Truth - Truth got a few hits here & there but this was nothing more than a showcase for Cesaro as he dominated & worked heavily over the midsection of Truth. This wasn't competitive at all along with a dead crowd as well.

Right around here was another in-ring segment between Vickie Guerrero & A.J. Lee like we've been getting for weeks on RAW but this time with A.J. having ""evidence"" against Vickie with other superstars that was only served the purpose of seeing Vickie having a new ally to fight her fight.

World Champion Big Show vs. Sheamus - Sheamus started out trying to go toe to toe against Big Show only to keep getting knocked down so went for a different strategy by going low on the legs before catching Show in a position that always worked against Andre The Giant. Show was able to catch Sheamus in mid-air with a spear before continuing his strategy of just beating on Sheamus & keeping him down with a nervehold while Sheamus fought back with his strength including an electric chair & White Noise. This was more competitive than their previous match at Hell In A Cell with the only thing negative I can say is that the finish got a little bit confusing but the aftermath definitely set the stage for a rematch.

Elimination Match - Team Foley vs. Team Ziggler: Randy Orton, Kane, Daniel Bryan, The Miz, Kofi Kingston vs. Dolph Ziggler, Alberto Del Rio, Damien Sandow, Wade Barrett, David Ortunga - It should be noted that Otunga was a last minute replacement for Cody Rhodes due to an injury earlier in the week. Various highlights here including the story of dysfunction between teammates, Dolph Ziggler being tossed & flipped inside out at various times, one wrestler doing a move that was a blast from the Four Horsemen's past, the interaction between The Miz & Randy Orton along with Miz's performance in the unfamiliar role of being a babyface, Orton & Del Rio squaring off once again, Mick Foley & Ricardo Rodriquez on the outside, one person getting a result that's been long overdue for months, and Jerry Lawler telling a joke so bad on commentary that it got quiet for a few moments. This was a good match overall.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. John Cena vs. Ryback - Punk tried running away but with him being the odd man out between both Cena & Ryback, he was caught between a rock & a hard place to the point where both men where shoving each other out of the way in order beat up on Punk before Ryback showcased his superior strength to the point where Cena tried to ground & wear him down while Punk tried to get his shots in whenever the other two were fighting each other. There were sequences between all three men where one would have a hold on the other before the third man got involved with a move of his own such as Punk starting with a Muta-like bridge chinlock on Cena that resulted in two back to back slams & how Cena's STF ended with all three men hurt before two men realized who the biggest threat in the match was making an unlike alliance to take him out. This was a fun triple threat match as Punk & Cena never disappoint while Ryback didn't look out of place here & had the match play to his strengths with an unexpected ending as far as EVERYONE involved.

This was one of those shows that came off like a bad sandwich were the opening (1st elimination) & closing (2nd elimination, World & WWE Title) were solid to good but the middle (Divas, U.S. Title, same type of A.J./Vickie segment we've gotten every single week on RAW) didn't measure up. Overall I'd say this was good for a rental.",1353542400,3,5454,4.524340770791075

The Divas title match between Eve & Kaitlyn was a rough-and-tough brawl but a good brawl none the less. The United States title match between Antonio Cesaro & R-Truth was not great but pretty good. The World's title rematch between Sheamus & The Big Show while good,wasn't as good as their bout from H.I.A.C and made even worse by the dumb DQ ending. The Main 5-on-5 tag team elimination match between Team Foley(Randy Orton,The Miz,Kofi Kingston,Kane & Daniel Bryan) against Team Ziggler(Doplh Ziggler,Damien Sandow,David Otunga,Wade Barrett & Alberto Del Rio) was a hard-hitting,entertaining,smash-mouth & fun bout.

1. Bonus Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match:
Rey Mysterio, Sin Cara, Justin Gabriel, Tyson Kidd, and Brodus Clay vs Darren Young, Titus O' Neil, Primo, Epico, and Tensai
  The first time I watched this match I found it to be an enjoyable, fast-paced opener. Then I realized that this match was a little too typical as an example for any tag team match. Started with a young competitor on the babyface team over his head facing Tensai. Time and time again for 18 minutes the heel team dominates. Then the one on the good team would get hot. As the good one tags in another member, the bad competitor the tags in Titus O' Neil over and over again. The only enjoyable part of this match was the high flying action to the outside which ended with Brodus Clay's elimination.
5 out of 10

2. Divas Championship Match:
Eve (c) vs Kaitlyn
  I usually skip the Divas matches then I realized that they are short an I am watching the whole event. I didn't know who Kaitlyn is, but she impresses me compared to the new Divas who make no sense to WWE. This match included some outside action as well as unique maneuvers by Kaitlyn herself. Actually better than the first match.
7/10

3. United States Championship Match:
Antonio Cesaro (c) vs R-Truth
  There is a Swedish United States Champion.
4/10

At this point a fairly humorous promo by AJ aimed against Vickie Guerrero

4. World Heavyweight Championship Match:
Big Show (c) vs Sheamus
  I find 2012 to be a poor year to me due to the fact that I found Smackdown matches unwatchable. Then I realized that RAW is not at its prime and that I should ignore the spoilers for once. On paper I was amazed that Alberto Del Rio finally gave up and that I thought that the match would be held in the Cell. The match itself was good at Hell in a Cell.  The match here at Survivor Series was good with both superstars putting on usual but entertaining spots to each other. They are both alike and well rounded with their move sets.
8/10
*Note that Sheamus has noticeable acne on his left boob*

5. Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match
Team Mick Foley (Randy Orton, The Miz, Kofi Kingston, Daniel Bryan and Kane) vs Team Ziggler (Dolph Ziggler, Alberto Del Rio, Damien Sandow, David Otunga and Wade Barrett)
  This was the expected Survivor Series match that was going to be good. Signs were that rivalries were entered in the match, it was later in the event, and Randy Orton is in it. Orton tends to be in the better elimination matches. The biggest superstars were used to make an actually good match on this card. I was most impressed with the moves put on by Kofi Kingston, Daniel Bryan, Alberto Del Rio, Wade Barrett and Dolph Ziggler. This kind of match keeps Survivor Series alive. The end is the best part.
8/10

6. WWE Championship Triple Threat Match
CM Punk (c) vs John Cena vs Ryback
  I had mixed thought about whether this match would be good or not. My opinion was that it was decent. The match started with Cena and Ryback both targeting Punk. They both put on good spots against one another when Punk was taken out. Punk and Ryback created the best spots. The two occasionally used big moves to screw each other. Cena just did the same moves. Overall, Ryback experienced the most damage in a series of events that is extremely rare to happen during one match.

SURVIVOR SERIES 2012

Ah yes indeed the event that would see the debut of The Shield which I personally love. This would also be the event in which CM Punk would defend his title in a triple threat match. Would he retain the title and keep his reign intact, I was very much hoping so.

1.[ELIMINATION MATCH]BRODUS CLAY, REY MYSTERIO, SIN CARA, TYSON KIDD, & JUSTIN GABRIEL VS TENSAI, EPICO & PRIMO, & THE PRIMETIME PLAYERS-this was a great opening match that would see various tag teams and two big guys come together to do battle. As with most matches like this these days is fast paced and full of high spots. The action between the established teams is the high light here, and this match goes to show they are not using Tyson enough. The big guys have a showdown that is good but the little guys steal the show. In the end Rey's team takes the win after a great opening contest.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]EVE VS KAITLYN-this wasn't a horrible Diva's match but it wasn't great either. It was a good contest and had some good moments. In the end Eve keeps the title after a decent Diva's encounter.

3.[US TITLE]ANTONIO CESARO VS R TRUTH-this was a good enough match that really saw Antonio take it to Truth for most of the match. Personally I would have loved to see these two in a more competitive match but it was good. Cesaro retains the title.

4.[WORLD TITLE]BIG SHOW VS SHEAMUS-this was a pretty good match with Big Show dominating with his size and power advantage. But Sheamus would fight back even demonstrating his strength at points. Good back and forth even though I would say Show was the more dominate one. People have been upset about the ending but I kinda liked it as it continued the story between these two.

5.[ELIMINATION MATCH]DOLPH ZIGGLER, ALBERTO DEL RIO, DAMIEN SANDOW, DAVID OTUNGU, WADE BARRETT VS KANE, DANIEL BRYAN, THE MIZ, KOFI KINGSTON, RANDY ORTON-this was at one point a Team Foley against Team Punk match at one point. I was really looking forward to that but then WWE went and changed it so we got this match. Don't get me wrong I love this match but I really love the old Survivor Series in which every match was an elimination match. Any way this is a fast paced match especially at the beginning and is one of the best matches on the card. These matches are always fun to me especially when these types of talents are in it. There are all kinds of high spots here and memorable moments. Also I should mention that David replaced Cody Rhodes here after he was injured on ""Main Event"". Nay way in the end Dolph pins Orton, the ending I was going for.

6.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS JOHN CENA VS RYBACK-this was a good triple threat match that actually felt like a triple threat match. Sometimes these matches just seem like spot matches but this one felt like an actual match. It would go back and forth between two guys in the ring and one out or down. Sometimes all three would be involved like a double team or something, including Ryback taking a ride into one of the tables. Then in the end The Shield debuts attacking Ryback and make him take his second ride. This leads to Punk being able to pin Cena without Ryback breaking it up.

BONUS
We get a little interview with CM Punk and Paul E after winning the triple threat match, love it.

BONUS RAW SEGMENTS

First we get the Vickie and Dolph accusing AJ of messing around with Cena.

1. BRAD MADDOX VS RYBACK-this match was basically all about Ryback smashing Brad and getting revenge. Personally I was going for Maddox, I like this dude for some reason. And way if he had won this match he would have got a million dollar contract. But instead he was destroyed by Ryback and put into an ambulance.

2. KANE & THE MIZ VS RHODES SCHOLARS-the fans got to choose who would join not only Kane on this night but also join Team Foley. It turned out that The Miz was picked thankfully because that is who I wanted on there. This was a good tag match especially for Raw but it was really to push Miz's face turn. I liked that Bryan was really jealous of Miz teaming with Kane. It came to the point in which Bryan came after Miz only to help Miz and Kane win. Also the interaction between the champs before the match was funny.

3. CM PUNK VS JOHN CENA-whether it is a title match or not I hate when the champion comes out first. I like Cena and all but he did not need to come out after the champ which at the time was Punk. Any way this was a really good match and main event for Raw but these two always work well together. This was best match of the night for sure but how could it not be? I didn't like that Cena won the match after Ryback prevented Punk from leaving nut at least Punk won the one that counted.

Next up we move to the Smackdown before the PPV. First we get The Miz and Team Foley going at each other only to be interrupted by Team Ziggler. That of course leads to the matches that night pitting members of each team against each other.

4. DOLPH ZIGGLER & ALBERTO DEL RIO VS THE MIZ & RANDY ORTON-this was a really good tag match here which is no surprise as Smackdown usually delivers on match quality. Good back and forth between the two teams with Miz getting the pin fall. That leads to Randy RKOing him after the win. This match showcased the problems between the team members on Team Foley.

This was a good event over all and I was glad that Punk kept the belt. I really loved the debut of The Shield here destroying Ryback. Dean is the future, I am telling you now. Great Blu-ray as it had all those special features and matches from Raw and Smackdown. If you are fan then go pick this up.",1360713600,,5597,4.326335877862595
