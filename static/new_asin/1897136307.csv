7801177,5,1897136307,"i really like this dvd..note the one star review does not address the film. The film follows the wheat harvest along the 2000 mile extent of the plains wheat growing area,  interviewing the crew manager/owner and the working crew and filming the grain combines at work. I love watching the machinery and this film expertly and evocatively shows the whole process. If you have any interest at all in the wheat/grain harvesting industry..you will truly enjoy this excellent film.",1467676800,,477,5.037974683544304
