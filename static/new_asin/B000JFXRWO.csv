2670381,5,B000JFXRWO,This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  The comics involved make this movie worth every penny spent.  The extras are even better!,1170720000,,143,4.461538461538462
2670382,4,B000JFXRWO,"This movie is pretty much what I expected...stock footage of penguins, fart and fornication jokes, and a bunch of random celebrities voicing penguins.  Myself and a roomful of friends thought the movie was hysterical.  While the plot moves a little slow, all of the jokes and the non-sequiters were hysterical.  Don't buy this movie expecting ground breaking, innovative humor.  It's simply a bunch of dirty jokes, sometimes immature jokes.  And I'm okay with that. It's hard to tell who's who, but that's the point since  they're penguins (they actually make a gag about it, too).

And a little piece of trivia...Bob Sagat got the inspiration for writing this film while 'dubbing over' march of the penguins while watching it for the first time.",1170547200,5,746,5.016260162601626
2670383,1,B000JFXRWO,"What a fantastic concept, and what a horrible execution.  South Park is a great example of how to make toilet humor work well. This movie is a great example of how ugly it is when it's done wrong.  This goes below low-brow, even below no-brow; watch it and you'll wind up beating your brow against the wall.  Watching such talented voices trying to make these jokes fly is as awkward and sad as sitting through a six year old's attempt to tell a dirty joke to a room full of adults.",1170460800,15,482,4.274725274725275
2670384,4,B000JFXRWO,"It's obvious that all these are remarks were made by people who only Bob from Full House and think he got into comedy after the show was finished.

That couldn't be further from the truth.

He was a comedian before full house and was just as sick and twisted then as he is now.

I personally like this movie. Some of it was stupid humor and a lot of it was lines that you just wouldn't expect to hear.

If you're a fan of Bob's comedy, believe me you're going to love this movie. If you're not, well then go buy the care bears dvd",1170201600,9,530,4.019047619047619
2670385,1,B000JFXRWO,"I used to think Bob Saget was a nice guy until this movie. It's terrible that he took a movie like ""March Of The Penguins"" about something true to life and poke fun at it. I like funny movies and parodies but this was done poorly and in poor taste. Just copies of footage from ""March of the Penguins"" with actor voice overs in a pitiful attempt to make jokes and tell a lame story. It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature so Mr. Saget should try another line of work than directing.",1170115200,5,483,4.148936170212766

2670387,2,B000JFXRWO,"Sometimes I'm in the mood for a movie with stupid humor, and stupid humor can be great when you have a group of friends just hanging out and laughing together. Unfortunately, ""Farce of the Peguins"" is the kind of stupid humor that is inexcusable and not the least bit entertaining...or funny! I'll just say it, it's a terrible movie!

First of all, anyone who hated Bob Saget doing his stupid voice-overs during ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" should just go ahead and skip this film. It's written, directed, and partially voiced by Bob Saget, and while there are a few noteworthy stars (such as Christina Applegate, Dane Cook, Tracy Morgan, and Samuel L. Jackson) who have lent their voices to this movie, it was not enough to save the movie from the depths of movie hell (where all the bad movies go).

Let's address the issues with this film: The humor was stupid, and raunchy (which, don't get me wrong, I enjoy raunchy humor sometimes too, but it just didn't work for this film). The movie is pretty much nothing but stock footage of penguins alla ""March of the Penguins"" that was edited together into a really vague story (and not a very good one at that). The voice talent tried really hard to save the movie, and okay, there were one or two funny parts...but thats it, and thats not enough to save a movie from falling on it's metaphorical face.

Bottom line, it was an awful movie and I don't recommend it (although...just a suggestion...it's probably a lot funnier and more tolerable if you watch it after having a couple margeritas).",1170028800,9,1545,4.672794117647059
2670388,3,B000JFXRWO,"It starts off interesting enough, Bob Saget doing his AFV animal voice-overs for March of the Penguins, and then it just goes in the gutter from there, not that that's a bad thing.  Tracy Morgan really stole the show in this movie though.  The humor is crude, raunchy, and downright juvenile, but it works and it does what it promises to do, entertain.  It's not high brow, it's not Oscar worthy, but, if you're sick of the same old family friendly nature crap, check it out, and prepare to be offended, because it's no holds barred.",1169942400,6,533,4.53125

2670419,5,B000JFXRWO,"A good old politically incorrect type movie [The naughty version of 'March of the Penguins'.] Samuel Jackson brilliant as the narrator and what a cast of comedic characters.  Bob Sagat as usual was fantastic - he can make you laugh even when he's not trying to and as for Mo'nique - wow! She is stupendous. Tracy Morgan's voice sounded like a drunken penguin  [probably was] and was hillarious. A British actor, Nick Simunek voiced the part of a dirty old English penguin and he was so good that I felt he probably was one in real life! Jim Belushi excelled as usual and John Stamos & Carlos Mencia were tremendous.  Amazed me to hear Abe Vigoda's penguin voice - what memories that bought back. Out of a cast of  about of about 40 well known comedians Bob Sagat, Nick Simunek, Jim Belushi Mo'Nique, Damon Wayans Dane Cook were by far the best and all the others were good. It could have been about 10 minutes shorter but if you want a good belly laugh go see it.",1381190400,2,963,4.423728813559322

2670432,5,B000JFXRWO,"A great little comedy. Gotta be open minded.

2670433,2,B000JFXRWO,"Amazon's review is pretty spot on.  I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/March-of-the-Penguins-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000BI5KV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">March of the Penguins (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  So, the idea of spoofing the hit documentary was a good one.  How funny would it be to hear what those penguins are thinking?  ""My feet hurt."" ""Are we there yet?"" ""Seventy miles to get laid?""  Maybe singing 99 Bottles of Beer?  But, this good idea was wasted.

The movie focused on the crude - there's a LOT of profanity, and sexually explicit jokes.  I was expecting that.  But, that's all there is.  The opportunity for less crass humor was completely ignored, so the film essentially becomes a one-liner, over and over again.  Marcus, the ""black"" penguin, is an almost painful clich - he's got a big penis, the ladies love him and he drops the f-bomb every other word.  Funny for a minute or two,  but after that beyond boring.  The love story, dragged out ad infinitum by songs, was overdone.  Samuel L. Jackson was a great choice as narrator - a huge contrast with Morgan Freeman.  And when Gilbert Gottfried's penguin tells him that ""Morgan Freeman has more talent in a freckle on his a@@"" it's laugh out loud funny.  But, such moments are few and far between.

I think what's most frustrating about this film is watching the extra features.  Bob Saget gathered a HUGE cast of recognizable talent to do tiny bit parts and main parts (a few didn't even make it into the film).  The extras show a lot of very funny lines that were recorded but edited out of the final film - not surprisingly, those lines didn't warrant the R rating.  The ""deleted scenes"" were better than the movie!  It's as though Saget decided he wanted to do Eddie Murphy's Raw instead of Bill Cosby.  Using both would have made this film a real winner, and worth re-watching.  As it is, about 15 minutes of the movie is funny - the other 60 minutes drags out those 15.  If you're curious rent it, but don't waste your money buying the DVD.",1231718400,3,2065,4.933139534883721

If you like a car wreck, or a tired old potty-mouth comic from a bowling alley way off the Las Vegas strip, you just might like this movie.  Outside TV, Saget's comedy has always been vulgar, and this ""film"" (loosely put) shows it in all his ""glory.""  It might have been an interesting idea for a 10-minute short if it had good writing, but for a feature film? Definitely not.  And the writing is just horrid; I've seen high school kids write better scripts (and jokes).  This is a penguin movie with terminal bird flu.",1206835200,,744,4.355072463768116

Definately adult. It won't scar your little ankle biters but put them to bed. Then you can laugh a little less self consciously. The penguins talk, Carl, Jimmy & Marcus played by the voices of Bob Saget, Lewis Black & Tracy Morgan. Samuel Jackson does the Morgan Freeman part, the narration. A dozen other voices that you'll recognize. It  covers the penguin life cycle. The endless marching, eating, marching, mating & birth of the next generation & again marching. Profanity laced jokes abound on food, sore feet, sex, the  meaning of life, love etc. Bob Saget is breaking out of his mold of sugary sweet sit-com star & game host. Sometimes junvenile, many the jokes are  straight out of the Yiddish joke telling tradition of bitching about life in general. Truly funny.",1206403200,,947,4.692771084337349

Very few movies give me consistent hard-to-breathe laughs, but this is one of them. Lewis Black was phenomenal, and some of the other cameos were priceless. I honestly don't know why some people hate this so much. But then again, I think ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the worst piece of schlock ever put to film, and some people actually think it's funny...so to each his own. This is not serious art, folks. This is just fun. They even make fun of the fact that it's ""stock footage"". I think Bob Saget on that Home Videos thing was possibly the most annoying human in history.

Imagine a bunch of comedians higher than a kite just improvising some dialog using their best high-school toilet humor to a bunch of stock penguin clips.

If you have a sense of humor to laugh at that kind of stuff, CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE.  If you are prudish, avoid this movie before you end up posting a bad review and wondering why anyone would make such garbage.

All I could think about was ""What Could Have Been"", if they had taken a little longer to think things out; or taken a few more shots at the movie itself - something - anything to make it funny.

2670454,5,B000JFXRWO,"I have to say I think people who give this movie a bad score just have a problem with this type of comedy.  Some movies are meant to be nothing more than a vehicle for raunchy humor.  This is one such movie, and it manages it perfectly.  An all star cast lends their voices to this parody, including one of the funniest men in America, Lewis Black, in one of the starring roles.  Bob Saget directs and co stars, and those who pay attention will notice he worked in nearly everyone who was in the cast of Full House.  I don't like Bob Saget as a serious actor one bit, but as a raunchy comedian he is fantastic.  This movie is not for everyone.  But if you can appreciate this movie for what it is and can enjoy this kind of humor, this may be one of the best examples you'll ever see.",1178582400,5,784,4.084967320261438

I expected better from Bob Saget and Jason Alexander.  It took the saddest parts of March of the Penguins and made fun of it.  I am so sorry that I bought this DVD.  I will not even lend it to anyone to watch because it would a waste of their time.  It is not even worth one star in the rating.,1178496000,2,463,3.872340425531915
2670456,5,B000JFXRWO,"First let me say that I am a huge fan of the Academy Award winning documentary, March of the Penguins.  Therefore, I wasn't sure what to expect from this satire on such a moving and well-made film.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it pokes fun in some places at the plight, albeit a chosen plight, at some of the real-life penguins, but all-in-all, this animated feature is just plain fun and funny.  Anyone who has seen March of the Penguins was made aware of the cleverness, endurance and caring nature of these beautiful creatures, and Farce of the Penguins shows the same clever, enduring and caring nature, yet in a lighthearted and, at many times, hysterical way.

I will say one thing.  This movie is definitely not for children.  It really is an adult-oriented animated film due to some of the language and sexual content.  Remember, this is an animated film with animated penguins, so I wouldn't go so far as to say it was raunchy or filthy, but it had some very suggestive scenes.  I will say that if you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh your butt off after the kids are in bed, this is the film for you.  Luckily, I don't have kids so I was able to watch it on a Saturday afternoon.  I highly recommend it.",1176163200,3,1241,4.422907488986784

This film pokes both fingers of fun at the Oscar Winning doctumentary March of the Penguins. Bob Saget said in the film documentary also on the disk, ""I started to adlib dialog to the movie, as I was watching it"". This film feels like that adlibbing in a more scripted and tighter form.

Samuel Jackson does his best channeling of Morgan Freeman's  narration in this film. Writer/director  Saget surrounded himself with the voice talent of Lewis Black, Christina Applegate, 30 Rock's Tracy Morgan, and most of the  Full House TV cast (Jodi Sweetin, Dave Coulier,  Lori Loughlin, and ER's John Stamos) whop seem to have fun doing this movie.

It is light hearted, sexual romp using stock penguin footage. Those who like the Aristocrats, will LOVE this!

I wasted four dollars renting this painfully un-amusing movie and could only stand to watch 15 minutes before turning it off.

Aside from the lack of any humor, there is also the fact that they are just showing random clips of penguins 95% of the time.  They could have made this an audio cd without hurting the movie, and in fact it would have made it better because if you imagine penguins talking and having personalities there mouths would move and they wouldn't just be stock footage clips of penguins standing around.

After all it is suppose to be a comedy, right? 10 minutes into the movie I hadn't even as much as snickered. 20 min was the same and it remained the same through out the movie. I just sat there wondering if I was missing something, but the others in the room assured me I wasn't. It was that bad. I never just stop a movie or walk out on it, but this one I was really tempted to do just that. Very poor narration by Samuel L. Jackson seemed painfully out of place, it would have far funnier if they used a one of those nature show narrator to add to the juxtaposition of the concept. The script was boring and reminded me of the dumb little video bits they did on America's Funniest Animals also with Bob Saget. It was just one of those dumb little video bit drug out for a entire movie, spiced up with bathroom and blue humor to I guess to entertain adults. Nearly every joke was lame and nothing near the quality of humor a number of this comic were capable of delivering. There was so much opportunity here for a really funny movie, but it was missed at every turn.
