4495373,2,B004XEEM9O,"Rather than discuss the obvious (whether the film is closer to morbid or boring, whether it's dishonest to market this as a true story when really it isn't, etc), I thought I'd focus on the opening narration, since that seems to sum up the movie.  In the opening scene, we see rescue workers hauling out a corpse (already in a body bag) through a snowy, fairly desolate area.  It's a stark, affecting scene.  Then, in the voice-over narration, a woman says how a ""meat industry worker ass"" chanced upon the corpse.

Wait, what? A ""meat industry worker ass""? Why is the guy who discovered the body an ass? Is the assumption that he's just another cog in the wheels of society? If so, that's extremely two dimensional and judgmental, since we never see that character and also have the opinion of a snotty narrator to go on.  It's also a pretty clunky, stupid sentence and completely clashes with the otherwise pseudo-documentary tone.  Yet it's telling because if memory serves, it's literally the first or second sentence we hear.  (FYI, I rewatched that scene a few times with the captions on just to make sure I'd heard it right.)

And for me, that sums up the problem with this film.  Yes, it's intriguing.  It has some teeth but often, it seems like those teeth don't know what they're doing.  This film badly needs some editing, someone to trim the excess and let the tension build less from repetitiveness than from ominous subtlety and surprise.  Honestly, I think this would be a lot more engaging if it were less art house, more actual documentary.  Since the ""true story"" this is based on is pretty nebulous, though, that's probably not possible.",1369008000,2,1656,4.708333333333333
4495374,4,B004XEEM9O,"This is the story of a man in his early forties who decided to commit suicide... through self-starvation.

The documentary is told entirely by narration accompanied by strange and miscellaneous film footage.

As a narrative the film is compelling and spooky.  This man is truly recording his own agonizing death.  He even goes so far as to tell us his masturbation habits, his bowel movement activity, and his philosophies of life itself.  The man's words are torn straight from the pages of a journal that he kept with him throughout the entire process.  The words are compelling, and it keeps you glued to your seat in anticipation, but the random film footage - used mostly as filler to keep the movie an hour-or-so - was lacking in entertainment value.  Part of it was in full color, the other half was in black-and-white which gives the documentary a very odd vibe.  As if the filmmakers couldn't decide which color scheme or what feel they wanted so they just did a mashup.

However... some of the black-and-white film footage is truly disturbing and adds a touch of insane beauty to the story.  Near the end of the film there is footage shown of a lone spotted horse limping through an open field and it actively gave me chills, it also reminded me of Samara's deadly ""tape"" in THE RING.

My one true complaint, and the reason for the four star rating, is the length of the film.  At one point I shouted, ""Die already dude!"" at the screen.  Other than that I say watch it for a poetic misadventure with a touch of horror.",1360886400,15,1528,4.573529411764706
4495375,2,B004XEEM9O,"I thought this was a true story but based on others reviews it seems as though its not. So, that kind of changes things as far as the story goes. This movie was okay, nothing profound, nothing real philosphical, I didn't really take much from it. Eventually it got to the point where it was just taking this guy in the story too long to die. I wanted him to die just so the movie would end. Everytime I thought he was dead, the narration would start again. Wouldnt watch it again.",1346976000,,480,4.228260869565218

4495378,5,B004XEEM9O,"This is a small movie, one you'll surely not see at the cineplex... no actor appears on screen, only a man's voice reciting his diary entries in a remote forested area as he slowly starves himself to death in a makeshift tent. Besides the visuals of the forest, the film is a collage of dream-like images, as the days turn into weeks as his body gradually shuts down.

The accrual of tension as time passes is haunting and disturbingly powerful. There's no moralizing, no grand questions put forward, no philosophizing, only a straightforward description of his disintegrating physical self over time. I watched this movie last week on netflix and it will not leave me be.

Certainly not for everyone; but, an experience you'll not forget.",1323561600,11,739,4.857142857142857
4495379,4,B004XEEM9O,"Watching and listening to ""The Sound of Insects"", its a narration that haunts you.

When we think of suicide, it's one person's quick way of ending their life and we are used to hearing about it on television and newspapers but what we don't hear are people who try to commit suicide, in this case through starvation and not knowing what to expect.

We often know through letters left behind of those who have went through with their suicide of the pain they lived in their life but with ""The Sound of Insects"", its the day-by-day narration of what the man committing suicide is feeling and experiencing at that minute.

We can easily relate or understand the concept of one not fitting in but we are not prepared to hear the self-torture that one will experience.  The man committing suicide doesn't know what he will experience and what will happen.  In his mind, stop eating and see how long it will take death to claim your life.  But the way its narrated, there is this sense of optimism that death will come shortly.

He enjoys listening to Bach and just waits for death to come and claim him.  But in the case of this man killing himself, we see him suffering as days past, then weeks and as morbid as it may sound, it's that final month of life where we see his mind start to question the pain he has put himself through.

He talks about the incredible pain he is feeling, the stomach cramps and bodily changes that he experiences.  From the loss of fat on his body to even losing his penis, most people want to end their life quickly and not suffer.  This man is suffering but you know that it was his plan to die and escape this world.

But with the agony of extreme pain and suffering and second guessing himself if what he is doing is wrong... We know he died but we know that he did have doubt in his mind at times.  The man never expected that suicide would be so painful.

But through the diary, we learn how slowly, his pain continues to get worse and worse and each time we think he is going to die, he lives another day.  What irony in that he chose a path to die but yet, death will not come to him sooner as he had hoped and must go through pain and more excruciating pain.

The DVD release of ""The Sound of Insects"" is primarily a barebones release but for any cineaste who has been wanting something new and different, ""The Sound of Insects"" may be what you are looking for.  I have never come across a film like this in my lifetime.  Some may compare the film to the uniqueness of Chris Marker's ""La Jet&eacute;e"" or ""Sans Soleil"" and I can see the similarities in terms of narration but ""The Sound of Insects"" is different.  You just don't see these type of films pop up and you have to give credit to Peter Liechti for pursuing and creating a film like this.  It was a very good adaptation and creative interpretation of Shimada's ""Miira Ni Naru Made"".

Poetic, esoteric and profound! ""The Sound of Insects"" is one of those films that stays within you.  Unique and definitely worth watching!",1312156800,22,3016,4.367383512544803

Four Stars instead of 5: Why?
This should have been a 5 star review and I am not sure detracting 1 is the correct thing to do for the reason I did it. I detracted the star because in a sense the basis for this book is very much misleading .  This is a listed as a documentary which, for all intended purposes, should mean that it is based off a true story/a real person or event. There is much controversy on if this was an actual event or if it was a made up story.  Researching this on the internet leads you to one of two views. Either someone wrote a book based off an actual event of someone starving himself to death, or someone just wrote a book based on the idea of some one starving himself today.  Because there is no name given to the Suicide Victim you have no way to determine if this was a actual account of someone's real diary as they faced the depths of death by starvation or if this was based of an idea of what it would be like. In other words, they may have heard that someone was starved to death, or even they starved their self to death, maybe in protest and decided it would make a great topic for a book, which was then later made into a movie. They stated up front that the man did not give a reason, nor did he ever mention any person that he had encountered in his years on this earth one time during this movie.  For me to consider this a true documentary I think it clearly needs to be stated it is based off an actual event, not based of a true store and a novel by an author.  A true documentary will give you something to research such as a place, time, history, names, interviews. In the end I am compelled to say this was a novel based off someone's idea that this would be a fascinating watch/read after hearing that someone had starved to death for whatever the reason, However, I hesitate to make this claim simply because I would be then be one of the people that I detest that make claim that the story is true or false based off their opinion rather than actual fact.  Which is what many posters have done here. We do not know if this was a novel based off a diary of an actual event or as I stated before a made up story based of an idea formed after someone had died of starvation.  There were no names given, no references to follow, nothing that can be followed.  To know he truth, you would have to ask the author directly and I can find nothing that says the author has stated it either way.  Any other statements about fact or fiction are just the opinion of interpretation to what people have concluded  in their own minds and decided to voice them as fact, when indeed we do not know if their opinions are fact.

The Review itself:
I will start by saying that this was actually one of the saddest, but most interesting ""documentaries"" (please see above why I hesitate to call this a documentary, but any future references will be done as so because this is how it was classified, not because my belief on whether it is or is not a true documentary) I have  ever watched.  I have read quite a few of the other reviews and what I can compare this to is a piece of artwork. Now please do not take that as I stated it is piece of art, because I am not doing so. What I simply mean by saying so, is that for those who look at artwork they see the beauty and are fascinated by the painting, the strokes of the brush, the lives of the painter who created them.  I am not stating art work is not a beautiful thing, but it is not ""my cup of tea"" so therefore I will never see the true beauty of the Mona Lisa, or the like.  True art lovers will be able to tell you what makes them so fascinating and so forth.  I find this movie much the same.  This must be your ""cup of tea"" to understand the depths of this movie.

This movie is a story of a man who decided he wanted to commit suicide. He states he has no attachment to this world, so presumably he had no attachment to any living person(s) as well and sets out to end his life.  His chosen method is death by starvation.  We can only assume why this was his intended method as we know this would be be an agonizing way to die.  I feel that in some ways he knew this is going to be a long drawn out suffering and he feels that he needed to suffer for whatever the reasoning.  Did he do something in living that he regretted? Did he feel he needed to suffer to be accepted in to heaven, because laws and his religious beliefs were that suicide is against the law or against God's will?  One can only base the theory of why because this story gives no insight into the reasoning he had choose to remove himself from this world other than he had no attachment to it.

The man, presumably in his forties, sets out with a make shift tent, a small bottle of water, a radio and a few other things into the woods.  There he settles himself into the journey to his death. In reviews people stated that this was a very long documentary, which by all accounts you could reason that, if you were not fully engaged into the story. This was narrative piece, with photography and artwork to accompany the narration.  In my opinion this was beautifully done.  Some of the art work or photography was very well placed and timed, leaving you with a deep emotional sadness, or a glimmer of hope that someone would come for this man to rescue him.  We forget that the rescue that we were seeking may have been in our own mind and not what this man would have felt. Other photography or artwork seemed it had no placement at all, except to give you a visual while the story was being told.  Yes you could have read the journal in about fifteen or twenty minutes, but then would that really be a book or a movie to make?  I think the story and the accompanying graphics lent as a whole to this documentary.

It let's you explore the thoughts as well as the life of this man as his body and his mind move closer to his death.  The moments where where he states his mind is clear and his thoughts are aligned and then as they slowly slip closer towards hallucination and further from the living world.  He takes you day by day through this journey of this man, who I feel was just lost in our world and wanted to be another place where he could be relevant, where he could feel wanted and where he could feel loved and accepted.

I can only now imagine the pain and loneliness this man must have felt out in the woods alone preparing for his death.  While he seemed to embrace the act of dying and accepting that this was what was to come along with the want of leaving this world I can only imagine that the pain and suffering was confirmed for the lack of tale told of a search for him or any detail of his life of loved ones he would miss after his death.

As most other readers we gain a hope for his survival only a handful of times as he contemplates walking back to the town he had left, or when he calls out when believes he hears a voice.  We want to beg with him, yell at him... get up... do not do this!  We want to reach out and lift him up and carry him back to where he will be safe.  Where he will be warm, he will find food... and love.  We as loving caring human beings want  to rescue this man.  However, again, this would be our rescue, it may not have been his.  I think that the fear, or the realization that he may get up and walk back to find the food, to carry on his life, would have been be met by no one.  No loving arms, no one that cared about him kept him on the path to death.  Maybe he was right in the sense that he was alone in the world, or maybe it was something deep inside him that could not let him see that he was loved and cared about.

None-the-less, this story takes you on imaginable journey through this man's last days.  It is sad, it is hopeful, it is fascinating, it is has allowed you to see a journey that you might not ever encounter.  It did not glorify, it did not justify, it did not rationalize, it did not give opinion.  It just simply was.

It was a beautiful documentary, that let you absorb and feel a full range of emotions if you just opened your mind to that state of being of it is just what it is.  It is nothing, it is everything. It let you take this man's journey and grieve for him, and in the end I was finally relived, although deeply saddened at the same time, that he found his peace.

I like that the author took you through emotions and beauty in a dark moment, without making you feel like you have to jump up and conquer the world or that you have to go rescue people from drugs, homelessness, or whatever disaster is currently happening in the world.  He simply just let you sit calmly and share in this mans last days to find his peace. In the end you are torn between having so many questions about this man and his life and who he was and what he was like, only to find nothing on who he was or even if this was a true encounter or if you simply wanted to be happy that the man was now in another world where he could find the love and life he desired.

Overall:
This was a very beautiful and moving story.  The author and the makers of this film touched my very soul.  They allowed me to have a journey I would never know, but also remind me that I am loved.  The music, the graphics and the narration were all very beautifully done.

Would I recommend this movie to other people?  Most likely not, but only because this movie is not for most people.  This type of documentary is the kind that is not intended for the masses, but for a certain genre of people.  If you are the type as I am who do not see death as the modern day shoot them up, glorified murder, spill l their guts on the movie screen horror film, but you can see this movie (not death itself, just this particular movie) as an artistic expression,  you may very well love this documentary as much as I did.",1434067200,3,9916,4.108346293416278
4495393,5,B004XEEM9O,"I think that the comments mean nothing for a piece of work like this, as it is not meant to be interpreted or criticized, it is about no one apart from the writer of the diary. To truly be absorbed by this one has to have traveled the road toward such a fate to some degree, with a mind to complete the journey some time in the future, maybe.

True beauty and clarity can only be observed once the thick dull shell of life is completely pealed from the soul. The narration in the Sound Of Insects illustrates this perfectly with the well understood imagery and audio to accompany.

4495407,3,B004XEEM9O,"It is important to understand that this is not actually a documentary, despite the Amazon label.  It is not even based on an actual event, despite what some movie descriptions state (""copy and paste"" syndrome).  Many sites refer to this as a movie based on a novel by Masahiko Shimada, which was in turn based on an actual event, the finding of a diary and the corpse of a man who starved himself to death in Japan.  But the corpse and diary are actually just part of the story itself - they were fictional, not inspirational, events.

The novel (more of a short story, really) is called ""Diary of a Mummy,"" and at the author's notes at the end, Shimada states that to write it, ""I consulted ""Kiga-shi no ichirei"" [A case study of death by starvation] in Hoigaku no jissai to kenkyu [Research and Practice in Forensic Medicine] 27, 1984, 145-152.""  The fictional suicide does not occur until 1999 in his story, however.  In other words, he read up on what it was like to die by starvation and then wrote a novel posing as a diary - he never pretended it was real.  The book was produced as a kind of theater show in Japan before being made into a movie many years later.

Shimada wrote another book about suicide called ""Death By Choice,"" in which he ridicules the idea that anyone knows what the inner thoughts of a person carrying out a suicide is really like.  He writes, ""I'd guess if you were in a state of mind that allowed you to pause and think about why you needed to kill yourself, there'd be a pretty good chance you'd give up the idea...we can't pop over to the other side and ask the people who've committed suicide about this, so their real motivations must remain a mystery.""

It seems clear that he's deeply interested in the topic, though, and chose starvation as the means of suicide for his character so that he'd be able to linger for a long time on the inner thoughts of the man supposedly killing himself - something not possible had the subject died of a self-inflicted gunshot, or overdose, for example.

In short, whether a person likes this movie or not should not be based on its believability.  It would fail if believability were the standard, because it is fiction.  Better to view it as an author's imagining of what death by starvation would be like, captured on film.",1418256000,16,2300,4.486810551558753

We don't even know his exact age.  He writes nothing about his life or his views on life or the world.  He doesn't share any feelings about anything other than pain. He has absolutely no history.

4495415,1,B004XEEM9O,"There is absolutely NO way this is a non fiction.  While it may be loosely based on an actual event, there is absolutely no documented evidence anywhere to suggest a human could survive for this length of time.  Functionally there is not a chance he could have held the pen and kept writing up to the point the movie suggests.  All we know about death by starvation indicates he would have been hallucinating wildly which would have prevented him for being able in any way, shape, or form to document his thoughts.  Don't bother with this one unless you enjoy creepy fiction",1389916800,4,574,4.598039215686274
4495416,5,B004XEEM9O,"""The Sound of Insects"" is an experiential film. It is very visceral... just the reading of an unidentified man's daily entries into his journal as he chronicles his slow suicide. And it is a slow death, slower than suicider thought it would be. From everything I've read this is the actual diary entries the man wrote. Anyway, I found it fascinating.",1386028800,5,350,4.754098360655738
4495417,5,B004XEEM9O,"This is based on a novel by a Japanese writer, Masahiko Shimada.
If I may, I would translate the original title as ""How I became a Mummy.""

I really got involved in this suicidal man's diary I felt his suffering and pain as mine. At the beginning, it is introduced that it takes a week for a person to starve to death without water, and a month with water. He runs out of his bottled water quickly, but he manages to collect rain occasionally. So I guessed that he was going to die sometime between his second week and forth week, but that was not how it turned out. Would he ever get to rest in peace? When???",1375056000,5,610,4.169491525423729
4495418,2,B004XEEM9O,"It's a cool concept but executed poorly. It's basically a man reading from the diary of a fictional person who committed suicide by starvation. After every few sentences, there is a long pause while you're subjected to random images and obnoxious sounds that are supposed to be poignant or disturbing, but miss the mark completely. All of these ""dramatic pauses"", coupled with the deadpan voiceover, make for a very disappointing hour and a half.",1373500800,2,446,5.04054054054054
4495419,5,B004XEEM9O,"I believe this story and the documentary portraying it is yet another form of proof that a person does not have to be mentally impaired, in any way, to choose suicide.  For some, it can be a logical and rational choice.  And, certainly it is every person's right to choose the time and means of death, if that is their desire.  It is not our choice to enter this world but how people leave it should be their right.

Definitely a film for the independent and open minded thinker.",1370044800,12,479,4.348314606741573

If you are able to go to sleep with someone talking in a soft smooth voice, the whole movie would be a wonderful thing to fall asleep to because its just a lot of nature and random sounds. Honestly, I wish that there would have been more information at the end about how they tried to find out who it was and how it came to be a book written by a guy who was not the one to find him. Anyway, the movie is meh.",1496793600,,507,3.8846153846153846
