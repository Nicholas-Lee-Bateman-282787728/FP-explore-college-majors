8630946,5,B000MTB8O6,"I was surprised the Rev. Copeland would put together this program.  It is not what we would call ""Old Time Gospel Music"", but it is great.  Copeland does a great job with the vocals and his vocal backup group is on top.  Then the Joshua Express Big Band is something else.  I think there were some in Copeland's audience that did not appreciate hearing some of their religious music done up in big band style.  Copeland was ready for that and had a great explanation concerning Gods dealings with big bands.  But the music really does SWING.  I have hundreds of big band DVD's and this is one of my favorites.  The music is so well arranged and as I said Larry Randall and the Joshua Experience and Kenneth Copeland do a really wonderful job of making Christian Music entertaining.",1404259200,,781,4.5285714285714285
