The music excellently conveys late medievalness, and the cartoon sets and costumes cheekily support the story.  I bought this to prepare for next season's performance at The Met, which without Terfel just won't be the same.  Bravo!",1368748800,2,315,5.26
3777942,5,B001RPZDXG,"The cartoonish production values served the cartoonish subject beautifully. There are no weak points in this superb production by Covent Garden. Bryn Terfel filled the role of Falstaff wonderfully, playing the loveable rascal to perfection and bringing out his humanity. No gratuitous schtick here. The supporting cast served their respective roles equally well. This DVD is must have for those who love the opera.",1356134400,,414,5.484375
3777943,5,B001RPZDXG,"This is a very funny production of a very funny opera. Bernard Haitink, in his brief interview, remarks that it is like champagne and sure enough, it really does sparkle from start to finish.

Graham Vick, the producer, comments that he sees this as very much an Italian opera. He stresses the Italian origins of the story upon which Shakespeare based his `Merry Wives of Windsor' and he stresses the medieval nature of the story. There is thus just a short step to applying the vivid colours of the Italian medieval world to this production. Speed is also of the essence and he remarks on the similarity of this opera story to similar stories found in `The Canterbury Tales'.

The staging makes use of this world of extremes in its design and in its use of colour. Interestingly, years later, Dover Castle has been re-opened and presented to the general public specifically with the colours, fabrics and social artefacts that are now believed to be true to its medieval period. These are remarkably similar to those found in this production. This vivid staging has been an obstacle to total enjoyment for some people who have seen it as unreal. Now, it seems, the historians have shown Graham Vick's instincts and ideas to be close to medieval reality.

The cast are as close to a dream team as it is reasonable to expect, let alone demand. Bryn Terfel makes a wonderfully over-large characterisation of Falstaff. This suits both his costume and his voice. Barbara Frittoli leads the team of four excellent Merry Wives in a totally engaging and merry way. It is obvious that great enjoyment has been had in this production by these four women. Roberto Frontali makes an excellent Ford as are Peter Hoare and Gwynne Howell excellent as Bardolph and Pistol respectively. Without going through the rest of the cast and individually singing their praises, let it be said, in my opinion, that all are equally excellent in all their various roles.

The orchestra is on top form with precision playing bringing out every pointed or barbed musical phrase as well as extraordinary lightness of touch. In all of this it would be hard to over-praise the conductor, Bernard Haitink.

There are short interviews with Haitink, Terfel and Vick as extras plus a documentary describing the refurbishment of the opera house up to the opening night.

The camera work is very involving and gives clear imaging and the vivid colours as intended. The sound is presented in excellent 5.1 surround format. The recording was made in 2000 and is still of excellent quality.

This has long been a favourite recording of mine of this opera and, given its undoubted performing excellence, it seems hard to imagine it failing to give the great majority of purchasers considerable pleasure and satisfaction. This is not the only way to present this very fine opera of course, but in my opinion, it is certainly a most enjoyable way or experiencing it. As a result, and in my opinion, it is an easy 5 star issue.

An Excellent Review with lots of interesting detail, Ian!
Bryn Terfel Jones is absolutely my Favourite Bass-Baritone - what a Personality! What a Voice! I assume you have his DVD Concert at the Concertegebouw (pronounced ""Konzert-KHE-bow"") in Amsterdam... (U.K. review)",1341619200,11,3367,4.945132743362832
3777944,5,B001RPZDXG,"Falstaff and Terfel, how could it miss? Terfel brings his entire self to every performance and in Falstaff he brings even more. The production values of this DVD are great and you will not be disappointed. The entire cast is outstanding. The sets in this production are really another character...amazing. A totally satisfying performance of Falstaff. If you are a Terfel fan, this is a must own DVD. If you are a Shakespeare fan, this is a must own DVD. If you are a Verdi fan, this is a must own. I'm sure by now you realize I really enjoyed this production of Falstaff.",1276387200,26,572,4.509615384615385
3777945,5,B001RPZDXG,"I have seen Falstaff 4 times, I think, and this was my favourite production. Brynn Terfel is great as the old fool and the colourful stage settings highlight the riotous colour of the period. Of course, Falstaff is not for everyone - its Verdi, as he was never heard before - no long arias but these delicious lyrical phrasings; I am thinking here of the aching potrayal of the young lovers in the garden.",1266969600,17,405,4.486486486486487
8338547,1,B001RPZDXG,"This is supposed to be a comedic opera but this interpretation is nothing more than a tawdry, cartoonist mockery of the comedy, which makes even Euro-trash seem acceptable. Verdi is rolling over, in his grave.",1479686400,,209,5.0

8338549,4,B001RPZDXG,Bryn Terfel again demonstrates his wonderful voice and acting talent.  The role really requires both and he delivers.  Roberto Frontali was a good Ford and Desiree Rancatore was a great Nannetta.  The staging was a little weird but it worked and worked well.,1426464000,,258,4.953488372093023

8338551,5,B001RPZDXG,"As close to a perfect performance as possible: the cast is excellent and has excellent comedic timing; the costumes are over the top and a good joke on their own; the impressive set is better than anything from Bugs Bunny; the music from the singers and orchestra is top notch; and the staging is terrific. Excellent, excellent production and I strongly recommend seeing it!",1402704000,,374,4.859375
8338552,5,B001RPZDXG,"Terfel at his best, Verdi would have been proud to see his great work performed in the manner and quality it does.",1397347200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8338553,4,B001RPZDXG,"For my dad, he enjoyed it very  much. It was a big surprise when he played it, loved all the characters.",1390521600,,104,3.9523809523809526
8338554,5,B001RPZDXG,"Verdi's Falstaff is comic relief sung to many of his earlier, unused creations of arias, used in this production of Falstaff to present his ""last laugh"" on his wonderful career of music & opera characters...
It is a riot of wit & music that keeps the listener alert as he presents this frolic of music, wit, and yes, there is Falstaff as his own personal tragic figure.. Verdi also critiques many of his previous possibly stuffy, imperious opera characters through Falstaff in jest - it is Verdi, making fun of his own younger self in this production
Bryn Terfel's impersonation of Falstaff, makes me realize that Bryn Terfel is also PERFECTION as he sings this opera..

8338555,5,B001RPZDXG,"I thought about buying this DVD because I checked out that this opera is going to be shown on the next HD Metropolitan Series (2013-2014) and even though I already had a CD,I wanted to have a DVD and this one was going to be a good selection since the main character was played by Bryn Terfel. The cast was very good.
Any one can see the transformation that the main character had to do during the story; He had to play a very old and fat man with a very big belly for which he wore a big prostatic torso. It is not a surprise how well he sang, he also is a very good actor, sometimes his character goes from disgusting to funny and you even fill sorry for him because after all he is humiliated and basically lonely.
Alice and Ford played by Barbara Fritolli and Roberto Frontalli respectively were very good as well as the rest of the cast.
The opera was very funny, I had to laugh in a few parts, for instance when Falstaf had to hide in a cloth dumper and thrown out a window landing in the Thames River wearing a ridiculous costume.
The scenery was appropriate; costumes and the makeup were great as well  as the singing and acting .
I enjoyed this DVD and recommend it.",1379203200,,1175,4.199115044247788
8338556,5,B001RPZDXG,"I had about given up on Terfel until his recent readings, Falstaff being only one.  His facial expressions are uncanny.  This is comedy down to the last brush of color.",1372896000,,168,4.566666666666666
