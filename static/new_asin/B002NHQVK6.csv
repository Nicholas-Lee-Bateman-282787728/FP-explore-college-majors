8375074,2,B002NHQVK6,The run time is three hours.  The set is fairly static.  We could not find any subtitles.  After about 30 minutes my wife made me stop and take it off.  It was hard for us to differentiate between the various characters.  We felt that the play dragged.  The images were clear and the sound fine for a production as old as this one.  I think it would be easier to read the play than to watch this production.  In any event the ending is very bleak so I had little incentive to continue.,1500854400,,485,4.139784946236559
8375075,4,B002NHQVK6,"On facebook, I'm picking the best home video version of each Shakespeare play, and also sharing the reviews on amazon.

The second Greek play by William Shakespeare is only available on DVD in the BBC version. You can't buy it on amazon.com but you can buy it on amazon.com.uk. Troilus and Cressida retells a story from the Trojan War, and so is more distinctively Greek than A Midsummer Night's Dream, where the fairyland invented by Shakespeare is really English, despite the superficially Greek setting. Troilus and Cressida is the blackest of black comedies and this production is suitably harsh and cynical. Love is lust and heroism mere brutality. There is a DVD about the Globe Theater production of the play, but so far not a DVD of the Globe Theater production.",1433548800,4,770,4.877862595419847
8375076,1,B002NHQVK6,"I have watched all of the BBC Shakespearean plays and think of them as being, of many, the best; the best acting, the most sincere; but this one I found absolutely repulsive.  All I could think was ""What the devil is this?""  I kept going back to the reading of the play and looking at the portrayal and asking ""Where in this, did they get that?""

I know that this is one of the most difficult plays to perform.  So why didn't they find real actors to perform this?

What is a truly reflective writing of the genius of philosophical reasoning on the battlefield where reflection is at it's peak and philosophy at its height; this play was more the parody of it as if played at the Gay Goose Prom rather than in Troy.  How does a history or a tragedy turn into something so meaningless. Panderus was atrocious.  I couldn't stand to watch him; I prayed that he'd be killed, and then came others.  When Achilles showed up I thought it was Achilles at the Ritz.

Cressida seemed to be the one hold out, who attempted to understand the meaning in the lines.  The rest are spilled out as dribble; meaningless and un-thought; where the lines are pumped out, metrical and broken as if the mirror were more important than the thought presented.  All I could think was ""Who directed this?  Did anyone rehearse?""

Worthless is not the word for this.  I tried a number of times but the repulsiveness of the portrayal made me give up and finally shut if off.  Both my wife and I had had enough of trying to get thru this.  What a waste of precious minutes.

""Good Lord save me from ridiculous!""",1384214400,5,1580,4.393103448275862
8375077,4,B002NHQVK6,"This production performs the play in more or less period (by which I mean Jacobean) dress. The set, as in most of BBC's productions is unapologetically theatrical but well appointed. The Trojan court takes place in a massive hall, the Greek tents and battlefields are littered with arms and supplies.

More importantly, Jonathan Miller successfully directs an incredible cast. This production takes Troilus at his word in his dispraise of himself. The smallish Anton Lesser plays him as unimposing and more a lover than a fighter in a very competent portrayal. Much more successful Susanne Burden as Cressida. She brilliantly captures Cressida's blushing trepidation and her ominous prescience of what is to come as well as her dejection when it does. Charles Grey plays Pandarus as a foppish, effete, fond old man, outfitted with a walking stick and too many necklaces. At times he flies over the top but he is easily forgiven. I would watch him read the newspaper. As ever he is deeply attuned to the lines. Miller has emphasized Pandarus', who appears in every love scene, participation in the love affair, often placing him between the lovers. This pleasure-fond old man finds great vicarious and partly sexual pleasure in bringing these two together. When they fall apart, his grief is his own.

Of special note in the supporting cast is Benjamin Withrow as a soft-spoken and supremely politic Ulysses. He shows great kindness and understanding to the forsaken Troilus. Equally compelling is Jack Birkett (aka The Incredible Orlando) as Thersites. Playing him at first in a dress and with a heavy lisp, this fool becomes-if I am allowed the term-an utter queen. His obvious homosexuality colors Thersites view as an outsider commenting, usually negatively, on the romantic goings-on of the other characters. Vernon Dobtcheff plays a wine-soaked and proud Agemmemnon and Kenneth Haigh is suitably vain and haughty as Achilles. The remaining supporting cast is excellent.

Troilus and Cressida is not one of Shakespeare's masterpieces but, as this perfomence aptly demonstrates, a very fine play none the less and deeply undeserving of the abuse it has sometimes been put to. As with all of Shakespeare's plays which dared to make men out of the heroes of antiquity, it was unpopular and rarely performed. The twentieth century, however, seized upon its disillusionment with war and jaded view of sex and found it bracingly relevant and meaningful as doubtless will any who picks up this performance.",1381017600,10,2503,5.144963144963145
