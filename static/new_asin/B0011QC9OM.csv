3067757,5,B0011QC9OM,IT HAS THE FIRST 3 LEPRECHAUN MOVIES FOR A GOOD PRICE...I LOVE THESE MOVIES ....IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS SET....ALL I WANT NOW IS THE OTHER THREE MOVIES...BECAUSE THESE MOVIES ARE HILARIOUS!!!,1272499200,,215,5.0
3067758,3,B0011QC9OM,"I love Leprechaun, I grew up renting these films every month and you should watch them if you have not seen these 3 classics.

PROS:It's a pretty good price and the films are very enjoyable, and the fact that it only has parts 1,2,3 are a good thing in this case because after that they go down hill fast, Leprechaun in Space, Leprechaun In The Hood, Leprechaun Back To The Hood are all forgettable and laughable in a bad way, but if you want the whole collection then it don't hurt to grab them.

CONS:This 3 pack DVD doesn't have any extras, and the DVD'S themselves are all white and have the titles written in black and you can barley distinguish the 3 except for the numbers.",1266105600,2,680,4.346456692913386
3067759,5,B0011QC9OM,"Leprechaun- I think this is a pretty good horror/comedy movie! Warwick Davis is awesome as the Leprechaun. After 10 years, Leprechaun is freed from his crate, because Daniel O'Grady put a four leaf clover on it. Whenever his gold is stolen, Leprechaun goes on a rampage by killing whoever has it. I highly recommend LEPRECHAUN!!!

Leprechaun 2- Years later, Leprechaun is resurrected and tries to find a bride. If she sneezes three times without being blessed, she will be his. He picks Bridget O'Day, so her boyfriend, Cody tries to stop him. I'd probably recommend LEPRECHAUN 2!!!

Leprechaun 3- This is probably my favorite Leprechaun movie because it has a better storyline and I like the characters, and it takes place place in Las Vegas. The Leprechaun is more funny in this one. After being resurrected at a Las Vegas pawn shop, Leprechaun goes after Scott McCoy because he stole Lep's gold coin. This time, you can make a wish while holding the coin, and it'll come true. Tammy Larsen, a woman who works at the Casino tries to help Scott throughout the bloody night. I highly recommend LEPRECHAUN 3!!!",1259971200,,1109,4.831578947368421
3067760,5,B0011QC9OM,"Save your money, ignore the ""Pot Of garbage"" collection it's just an excuse to try and sell the crap in space and in tha hood Lep films.  This set is cheap and worth the money if your a fan of horror films and Leprechaun.",1245456000,,221,4.0227272727272725
3067761,4,B0011QC9OM,"THE MOVIES:  In the original ""Leprechaun,"" Jennifer Aniston and Mark Holton (Francis Buxton in ""Peewee's Big Adventure""), along with a few other people, fend off the little limerick-spouting guy with all the makings of a B-movie, including numerous plot holes and humor (watch the characters throw a bunch of shoes at the Leprechaun only to have him throw up his hands in exasperation when he realizes he has to polish all of them and try not to laugh).

In ""Leprechaun 2,"" The Leprechaun tries to win himself a human bride.  This sequel is just as strong as, if not stronger than, the original, with well-written characters and some cool deaths.

""Leprechaun 3"" moves the Leprechaun's inevitable search for his gold to Vegas.  While this movie marked the beginning of decreased production values (and quality) for the series, there's still fun to be had as well as a metaphor for losing oneself to avarice.

THE DVDS:  Each movie is released on its own DVD (so thankfully, no flippers).  While I've never seen the individual releases, I'm guessing these DVDs are the exact same ones, and they feature the movies as well as audio selections, scene selections, and trailers, but no special features.  Some more bad news:  the screen format of all three movies is the same as the individually packaged copies, so while we get ""Leprechaun 2"" in Widescreen, the original ""Leprechaun"" is still presented in Full Screen format, as is ""Leprechaun 3.""

THE PACKAGING:  The set comes in a standard-size DVD case that's set up like other recent three-movie releases (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Gun-Triple-Feature/dp/B000PHX5QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Gun Triple Feature</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beverly-Hills-Cop-Collection-Beverly-Hills-Cop-Beverly-Hills-Cop-II-Beverly-Hills-Cop-III/dp/B000MGBLSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beverly Hills Cop Collection (Beverly Hills Cop / Beverly Hills Cop II / Beverly Hills Cop III)</a>, with a plastic hinged piece that houses a DVD on either side and the third DVD kept in the usual place on the right side of the case.  The whole thing is then encased in a sweet-looking sleeve that features the cover art done in metallic ink.  The whole thing will look good in your DVD case and only takes up the space of a single movie.

If you're new to the series or a fan looking for the best way to have the first three movies, this is a good buy - the price is great for three movies, and you're going to want to get it before the cool sleeve is discontinued.",1205280000,14,2622,5.503740648379052
