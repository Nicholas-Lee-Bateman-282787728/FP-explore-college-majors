1086762,2,630587123X,"Chesty Morgan (real name Lillian Wilczkowsky but billed here as
simply Zsa Zsa) and her 73"" bust made their movie debut in this
cult sleaze classic by schlock-shock director Doris Wishman.  In
this sexploitation tale Chesty uses her gargantuan chesties to
smother the bad guys who killed her lover.  What a way to go!  At
least it's a novel idea -- the only one in this bizarre film.  The
image and sound quality are pretty good.
This DVD has few things to recommend it except the movie itself.
Just a theatrical trailer for the movie and its sequel, Double Agent
73, a chapter index, a silent montage of posters of other Wishman
efforts, and a short subject called ""Breast Development"" which
looks like it was transferred from a poor quality 16mm film from
the `50s.  It's rather tepid but of some interest.
The main interest is, of course, Chesty herself and her incredible
endowments, which she displays here at every opportunity.  Don't
miss this one, if you're a fan of really huge ""talents,"" or of
`70s-style fashions -- remember those bell-bottom pants?",1007078400,6,1060,4.7967032967032965
1086763,4,630587123X,"Doris Wishman's mind-numbingly bizarre showcase for the gargantuan talents of veteran stripper Chesty Morgan cannot by any objective standard be called a good film, but it remains hilariously watchable.  When Chesty's  boyfriend (make that, sleazy middle-aged guy friend) is murdered, she takes  revenge using the weapons God gave her.  And yes, they are definitely  nature's and not a surgeon's handiwork; her staggering frontal development  saggingly shows the effects of gravity and every minute of Chesty's then  40-something years.  The sight of our fleshy, blank-faced heroine raising  her flabby arms and somnambulently lurching towards her victims like a  classic movie monster before smothering them to death in her yawning  cleavage is not something you'll soon forget.  Multiple viewings are  recommended in order to fully appreciate the hideous 70's fashions (dig  those shoes!), tacky motel room ""sets"", tinny post-synch sound  and hilariously inept camera work, all of which combine to form an  ineffable grindhouse gestalt.  Ms. Wishman may not have been a competent  filmmaker, but she was certainly an unforgettable one.",961113600,15,1137,5.627218934911243

7897496,1,630587123X,"Crime drama and sexploitation go together like peanut butter and jelly, and Doris Wishman is certainly one director who made a career off blending the perverse with the criminal. So, you'd think with a gimmick like Chesty Morgan at her disposal, you'd have an easy winning sleaze-fest. Sadly, you'd be very much mistaken.

In ""Deadly Weapons,"" Chesty plays a woman named Crystal, who's boyfriend is a member of the mob. But when he double-crosses his boss, he ends up dead. So, Crystal sets out to revenge her lover with the two best weapons she has: her enormous breasts! That's as far as any story development goes.

To say the plot here is tissue thin, is really an insult to tissues. Little in this freak show makes any sense. We never learn what the information is that the crime boss is so eager to recover. And when Chesty's character goes for her revenge, there is absolutely no planning of any kind. She just packs up and miraculously finds her targets. The attempt for a twist ending, unlike Chesty herself, falls completely flat. Throw in some of Wishman's typical directorial excesses throughout the film, like lingering camera shots of the floor or ashtrays and plants, as well as a group of actors who don't know how to deliver lines, even they are sent by Western Union, and you have a train wreak larger than Chesty's own boobs.

And speaking of which, let me say, as an American male of the heterosexual persuasion, I love me some boobies. But Chesty's aren't sexy at all. Not just because their massive size is so unseemly, but she really doesn't even know how to use them effectively. There's a striptease scene she does about halfway in the film and it has to be the most unerotic thing I've ever seen. She just looks like she walking through the whole movie bored out of her mind. Even a scene where she bathes is completely unenticing.

Is there anything worth seeing here? Well, there is some nice scenic shots of the old 70's Las Vegas and Miami. And the opening montage during the credits is as close as Chesty comes to doing anything of value with her ample mammaries. That's about it, however.

No one ever goes into a sexploitation film like this expecting great cinematic brilliance, but you do expect some level of entertainment value, either by arousal or unintentional humor and a fun plot. This film has neither of those qualities, which given Chesty's figure you might think wouldn't be possible. There was certainly enough potential with the material and assets here to make something that could have been some dirty fun, but there was simply no follow through by anyone involved with this production. What you end up with is an uninteresting and unerotic film, which is pretty much a kiss of death in this genre. Unless you are a total Doris Wishman die-hard, this one should be an easy skip for you.",1345075200,,2836,4.686746987951807
7897497,5,630587123X,"The Queen of Exploitation, Doris Wishman, brings us one of her most successful films and her most popular female superstar, Chesty Morgan (billed in this movie as ""Zsa Zsa"").  Where in the world did Doris Wishman find Chesty Morgan?  I'm sure there's a story there.  Chesty is clumsy throughout the film, she has zero talent as far as acting ability is concerned and she looks as if she is absolutely miserable in practically every scene.  Her teeth are hideous, her wigs are tacky, and whomever it was that told her to get dressed for every scene in the closet in the dark should be ashamed of themselves!  As is the trademark for Doris Wishman movies there are many shots of feet, lamps, and other such inanimate objects for no apparent reason (often the camera will zoom in on Chesty's monsterous breasts) but all of this makes the film more appealing in a strange and bizzare way.  The plot is simple...after the mob kills her boyfriend, Crystal (played by Chesty) goes on a rampage and murders his killers using the only weapons she has....her 73 inch breasts!  Yes, she actually suffocates her victims between her ample bossoms in mind boggling murder sequences that must be seen to be believed!  This film was so successful that it spawned a pseudo-sequel titled ""Double Agent 73"" which also features Chesty and is directed by Wishman.",1107907200,17,1342,4.779220779220779
7897498,4,630587123X,"After years of searching for this one on video, I was lucky enough to find two.  This past year I upgraded my collection to DVD and thought this would be a lost cause to find, but YES!  I found it!  With little effort I might add.  I first saw this movie at the drive-in as a kid playing with ""Ilsa:  She Wolf of the SS.""  What a double (and do i mean DOUBLE) feature.

This film exists onlt to show off its stars endowments.  She uses them to seek revenge on her husbands killers.  A great concept.  Ex-porno star Harry Reams (who is equally endowed a little more south) helps her seek revenge.  The acting is wooden, almost zombie like.  The direction is nill, but with a sense of a documentary-style of the 70s.  Thats OK.  This is a revenge flick, much in the same vein as ""I Spit On Your Grave,"" and ""Don't Mess With My Sister.""

Its full of campy charm.  Not much else really, but it is like a car wreck.  You can't help but watch because its so repulsive and oddly entertaining at the same time.  Not in everyones taste, but those into cult films and drive-in sexploitation fare of the 1970s should find this rare entry in the ""Something Weird Video"" line will want this in their collection.",1100476800,5,1198,4.2959641255605385
7897499,4,630587123X,"A friend of mine gave me this as a gift -- I'm not sure if I should thank him or not.  Oh man is this bad.  I've only been able to sit through it once, with said friend for moral support.  On a funny side note, I used to work with a guy who I wanted to see ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (which is an INTENTIONALLY funny film).  When I brought that movie in to work for him to borrow, I also brought in this one, as a joke to lend him.  Well, he watched THIS but never watched ""Kentucky Fried Movie"".  Go figure.",1089504000,2,504,3.8446601941747574
7897500,5,630587123X,"Don't get me wrong folks... there's no doubt about it... this film is a bonified stinker... however, its bonified stinkers like this that can lighten up any dull evening at home (or even better, if you're that age, at the dorm) - - just get out a few beers, pop this one in the player... and let the jaws drop and lude conversations flow.  - - Though Ed Wood is often described as the worse film director of all time (and John Waters achieved his greatness by trying to be) - - after seeing this film, I'm sure you'll agree that there's Bad as in Ed Wood and Dwain Esper... and downright awful as epitomized by the late great Doris Wishman.  - - But don't get me wrong : I'm glad she walked the planet... she tred gound few others had the guts to.  Let's face it : while perhaps a John Waters, Russ Meyer or Pedro Almodovar might have had the guts to make a tongue in cheek film about a lady who's mountainous boobies were her deadly weapons, who but Doris Wishman could have done it so... well so *un*campily... This is a typical trademark of Doris Wishman's films...  - - While an Ed Wood Film will make you laugh, Waters puke and Russ Meyer run for a cold shower, expect none of this from a Doris Wishman film... no matter how much nudity or violence there is... no flinching, no gasps... and no woodies... yet, despite the absence of this, your jaws will drop at times... and that my friend is art... unintentional perhaps... but art nonetheless...  Rumor has it, incidentally, that Chesty has gotten a breast reduction and is now a serious stage actress (...*not*)",1068940800,5,1569,4.41522491349481
7897501,3,630587123X,It's ok for the time period that it was made. The acting is ok and I really think there was a plot but the sound wasn't good on my dvd to make a rash decision. It was an entertaining movie and would recommend renting it first before buying so you don't get disappointed.,1018828800,2,270,4.113207547169812
