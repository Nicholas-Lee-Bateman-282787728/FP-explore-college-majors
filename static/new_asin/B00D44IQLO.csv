The Manga picked up again after a looooong hiatus and hopefully Season 2 is in the works =^w^=",1323302400,,206,3.9285714285714284
5773439,5,B00D44IQLO,"2 DVDs.  300 minutes.  12 episodes.  A mini-series.  Full of cats, romance, comedy, and fan service.  What more could you want?
I really love a anime mini-series, they are like snacks.  Sometimes you want a snack, a tiny snack, not a three course meal.  24 episodes?  Sometimes that can be too filling.
The plot - boy is cursed to help 100 cats or he will turn into a cat.  Problem - he is allergic to cats.  He can't stand to be near them and if he is turned into one he will most likely die.
Now add the fact that he is a normal school boy trying to link up with the one girl, a best friend, who does not seem to be interested in him and that's like adding a cherry to a ice cream sundae!  A wonderfully funny anime with tons of funny one-liners and weird female characters.
There is only one problem many of you may have with it.  No dubbing.  Only subtitles.  Sorry.
But for people who love cats, romance, comedy, and curses this is the anime for you!",1322784000,,955,4.147540983606557
5773440,4,B00D44IQLO,"Again a bit of harem comedy with a great story.  The main character, very allergic to cats,  accidentally damages a cat god shrine in a moment of carelessness.  Suddenly, he can understand every thing that cats say.  The shrine 'cat' tells him he must help 100 cats or he will turn into one, and with his allergies, it would be a death sentence, so while his friends don't understand his new strange behavior, he diligently tries to fulfill his obligation.  It is very funny.",1319241600,,475,4.607142857142857

He suddenly has the ability to talk to cats and must do 100 good deeds to end the curse or become a cat himself. Being allergic to cats it will obviously kill him. If you are into the whole Harem type anime series and like a good laugh, this one is for you. His interaction with his love interest is probably the funniest in the series.

Now, don't get me wrong, even if this show follows the same patterns as others in its genre, it pulls off what it intends to do very well. Obviously, if you like watching series in this genre, you know what to expect the majority of the time. But honestly, a boy who's allergic to cats gets cursed by a cat deity statue + a harem + wacky, over the top comedy + romance + misunderstanding = an overall pretty interesting and enjoyable story. This one has a very similar feel as series like Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina, just to name a few.

The show is NOT dual-audio, which is good - there are a lot of things referenced, like ganguro and yakuza, that simply don't translate well. If there's any complaint, again, it's the box art - I have to hide this behind the other DVDs simply because it looks like cheap anime hentai or something.",1295222400,15,592,4.390909090909091

5773446,4,B00D44IQLO,"In 2007, the manga ""Nyan Koi!"" by Sato Fujiwara was serialized in the free web comic ""FlexComix Blood"" and two years later, the manga receives its anime adaptation from AIC and makes its DVD debut in the US courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

The series is directed by Keiichiro Kawaguchi (Kowarekake no Orgel"", ""Sket Dance"", ""Hayate the Combat Butler""), screenplay by Shinichi Inotsume (""Kowarekake no Orgel"", ""Hayate the Combat Butler"", ""Sket Dance"") and features music by Manabu Miwa and Shigenobu Ookawa.  Character designs are by Kazuaki Morita (""My Bride is a Mermaid"", ""Tentai Senshi Sunred"") and art direction by Naoko Kosakabe (""NieA 7', ""Kissxsis"", ""Jinki: Extend"").

""Nyan Koi!"" is a series about a high school sophomore named Junpei Kosaka and he is allergic to cats.  So, much that he hates them and one day, he thinks he hears his cat Nyamsus talking to him but dismisses it.

As for Junpei, he is always dreaming about his friend Kaede Mizuno and wishes he can get closer to her.  One day, while he was walking home from school, Junpei kicks a can and it hits a neko-jizo-sama statue (a cat statue that serves as a guardian deity of cats).  Having broken the cat statue, now Junpei is forced to grant 100 wishes to cats and if he doesn't do it, he will turn into a cat which will eventually kill him because of his allergy towards cats.

And to remind him and watch over him is his family cat Nyamsus who tries to make sure Junpei know of his curse.

So, Junpei will do all he can to help cats, even though he dislikes them.  But along the way, each time he helps the cats, he encounters other girls who start to take a liking towards him (and in the process, making other girls jealous) because of the attention he is starting to receive.

VIDEO :

""Nyan Koi! - Complete Collection"" is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. The animation tends to change from very cutesy style of anime that will appeal to the fans who love cute characters, especially for the cats and then shifting to normal anime style.  Character designs are well-done, especially the closeups.  The background art tends to differ depending on the scene with some look quite simple to others looking a bit more detailed.  I did notice more background art being used in the second half of the series and for the most part, I really enjoyed the character designs for this anime series.  For the most part, the animation and art backgrounds for ""Nyan Koi!"" are very good.

The colors for ""Nyan Koi!"" are quite vibrant and for the most part, animation is up-to-par with other TV anime related series.  It is important to note that because the series was released on Blu-ray in Japan, I wouldn't be surprised if Sentai Filmworks/Section23 Films releases ""Nyan Koi!"" in HD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Nyan Koi!"" is presented in Japanese 2.0 Dolby Digital stereo.  Voice acting is well done for this series.  I felt that Shintaro Asanuma did a great job with the voice of Junpei, very cool, deep voice.  Meanwhile, the voice actress such as Yuka Iguchi as Kaede, Ryoo shiraishi as Kanako and Haruka Tomatsu as the twins, all did a fantastic job.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Nyan Koi!"" comes with the clean opening and ending themes plus trailers from anime currently available from Sentai Filmworks.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Nyan Koi!"" is quite an interesting harem anime series.  Despite the usual storyline of all females starting to like a certain guy, Junpei is an interesting character as his interest is primarily on Kaede and the only reason he was nice to the other girls was because of their cats and his obligation to grant 100 wishes for the cats or else he will turn into one and die from his allergy.  It's a bit twisted in a way but ""Nyan Koi!"" is a pretty fun anime series.

Each episode is connected to each other, so there is no worry of filler episodes.  Each episodes tend to focus on Junpei fulfilling the 100 wishes but at the same time, these episodes also build upon him trying to get close to Kaede but yet the others also wanting to get closer to Junpei and we get to see him starting to care for the others but yet the writers finding ways to tease you in regards to Junpei and Kaede's friendship and how close they will get.

But each of the characters are quite fun to watch and it does make me wonder how much crazier the actual manga gets and how many more girls are introduced to this whole harem mix.  But because this series alone focuses on not too many characters, each episode does feature plots that further the character development, relationships and jealousies that exist.  But it all comes together quite nicely.

As mentioned earlier, this is an anime series that tends to go from serious to a cutesy style but by no means is this an anime series for young children.  Yes, it does have many cute moments but it's also important to note that while the series doesn't feature any nudity, there is some perverted humor as characters such as Kanako Sumiyoshi (who has big breasts) tends to jiggle wherever she goes and Nagi Ichinose has this thing about grabbing on Kanako's breast.  Also, a few pantie shots that show up form time to time. So, there is some perverted humor in this series but nothing that tends to overshadow the whole storyline.

As for the DVD, you do get 12 episodes and the vibrant animation is quite pleasing.  The only downer is the lack of special features but unfortunately, with TV series, it's becoming more of a common place to not see much special features on anime on DVD these days, ""Nyan Koi!"" is no different.  As for those who are video or audiophiles, there is a Blu-ray release in Japan, so it will be interesting to see if Sentai Filmworks will bring out a Blu-ray release to the US.  But it's a series that would definitely look much better on Blu-ray, although audio-wise, the series will probably be more ambiance-base since its a dialogue driven series.

But overall, ""Nyan Koi!"" is an entertaining anime series.  I enjoyed it so much that I watched it all in one setting.  There is a good amount of comedy, drama and fan-service and I have no doubt that this series will go over well with anime fans.  If you love ""harem anime"", definitely give ""Nyan Koi!"" a try!",1292284800,31,8493,4.490861618798956
5773447,4,B00D44IQLO,"When reading a synopsis for the series, one is struck by the weirdness of the concept. Junpei, the main character, is allergic to cats. By accident, he breaks the local cat-deity statue at a shrine, cursing him. Suddenly, he can understand what cats are saying, and must do 100 nice things for cats or he will turn into one himself. Being allergic, turning into a cat would kill him.

But that isn't really what the show is about. It is a slice of life anime heavy on the romantic comedy, following Junpei in his quest to become closer to his crush, Mizuno. As in most anime of this genre, complications are abound and more than one girl besides Mizuno falls for Junpei, setting up some very amusing situations. Sure, the concept has been done to death (besides the cats) and these types of anime are a dime a dozen. But that doesn't stop this show from being very, very funny.

The characters are really alive. There are some seriously good one-liners in this series, and the dialogue is just comedy gold in general most of the time. I was intrigued by the feline concept of the show, but was surprised to notice that, when his curse became a subplot throughout the series, I didn't mind. The characters really make this show shine.

The animation is fluid and very well done. This DVD set will ship without a dub, so be prepared to read subtitles if that is something that matters to you. Personally, I prefer watching anime in the original language, so a subtitled set is perfect. If you like comedy, slice of life, love triangles, and a little feline mischief, this is a series you don't want to miss.",1292112000,63,1605,4.527586206896552

5773449,4,B00D44IQLO,"I saw the first couple of episodes on Anime Network and liked it, that is why I bought the complete series.

Bombarded with feline requests and surrounded by a bevy of beauties his life becomes very complicated and making matters worse he must keep his curse a secret.

The animation is great, the characters are likeable, the story although simplistic is very entertaining and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any cat loving anime fan!

The series is very short (12 episodes) but its a very great series. Its more of a romance + Comedy than anything else. The anime actually can be funny at times but can get pretty annoying on certain parts. This anime is actually one of my top 10 favorites.

A thing I'd like to say about the package, why is this a complete series when there is only one episode? Yes a season 2 was confirmed at the end of season 1 but how ever they never got to release it because they couldn't get the Licensing for it.

5773460,4,B00D44IQLO,"This anime came out around the same time as Kampfer. Compared to the crap Kampfer dished out, Nyan Koi while a simple storyline was very endearing.

The plot does stand out though. The main character Junpei Kousaka is allergic to cats and therefore avoids them when can. One day, he accidentally he breaks an artifact angering the Guardian of Deity of Cats. Now he has the ability to hear and speak to cats and this is because he's been cursed. He has to fulfill 100 favors for cats or he'll turn into one himself. An ironic end for someone who hates cats.

The irony is the plot given isn't actually the main focus of the series. While Kousaka is shown doing things on screen relating to the curse, the focus is about his relationship with his crush Kaede and the other girls. The characters in this series as a whole develop as a person despite there only being 12 episodes (where's my season 2?!)

Most people tend to hate the main guy with the main girl and I would have hated Kaede. But Kaede is so adorable for the female lead. She's kind, helpful and shown to be bad with animals (as cats are scared of her kind nature). I find her kindness toward her rivals as genuine and alas, the other girls find it hard to hate Kaede especially Kanako. The unlucky childhood friend (who is a tsundere) is very understanding for a tsundere. Most tsundere characters are just jerks to the main guy for no reason whatsoever (and while I prefer them over yandere girls, this obnoxious attitude can go too far). Kanako and Kaede are best friends and I find it adorable how Kanako is willing to let Kaede win since she values her friendship with Kaede (but she does continue to struggle with her feelings for Kousaka). And while Kanako does beat up Kousaka, its not extreme as some other anime where the girl breaks the guys bones. The other girls in the harem are rather interesting as well. Nagi, the masculine lesbian (I'm calling it) is obviously in love with Kaede but claims she's just attracted to her beauty...uh...yeah. -_-  but she's fluxuating between bisexuality between supporting Kousaka and Kaede's relationship to helping herself out and hitting on them both, but she's actually hilarious and cute at the same time. Finally you got the twins Akari and Kotone...the tsundere and yandere. Now I would hate Kotone, but she's so cute (I'm using this word too much). Her yandere is toned down though compared to others. The worse she does is get Kousaka's number and text him multiple times saying stuff on how he cannot go beyond holding hands but then says that she's fine with him dating her. Her twin sister Akari is also a toned down version of a tsundere (less than Kanako) and while she does hit him multiple times for no reason, again it's not too serious (plus I would like to think the twins are aware that they're in a harem and say a lot of things that the usual stereotype wouldn't say as a result). I would add the mail lady Chiziru as another option but she's not really a love interest as the cool big sis to Kousaka.

Kousaka himself actually is surprisingly likable protagonist (unlike Natsuru who is retarded and Makoto who is such an a-hole.) He generally is a nice guy and not a pervert. Most of the situations he's thrown in is because of bad luck and he has shown to won the girl's over by being kind toward them with the main example being Nagi who was very antagonistic toward him (and he was mean to her back because he thought she was a guy). Despite his hate for cats, he generally seems to start to appreciate them as the series goes on and everyone sees him as a cat lover. Also, his two male friends are hilarious (and one of them is so fabulous~)

Which reminds me, I can't remember the episode, but I feel like it was the best one where Kousaka is accused of being a pervert like the majority of harem animes have but unlike other animes, when he's shown to be innocent, everyone actually apologized for their behavior. What anime does that? This anime is a slice of life but it was very heartwarming to see that the two guy friends that are usually jealous of the main guy getting all the ladies (one of them isn't because he's so gay), the local tsundere and the violent bifauxnen apologize for the misunderstanding (they try to side step it but they knew were in the wrong).

Overall, it's a very cute series. I can't give it a perfect because it's very generic anime series. It's not the best harem series out there but its definitely not the worse. I put it very high on my harem scale (Negima manga is the one on the highest along with Shuffle) and to watch it if you have the time.",1362355200,3,4622,4.456264775413712

5773462,4,B00D44IQLO,"This is definitely anime/ecchi worth the purchase, don't get me wrong.

I just find it odd that a show geared towards Nyan/neko cat cuties type viewers really doesn't do all that much with cats. Don't let the cover fool you, no one in the show ever has cat ears, save the protagonist and even then only briefly.

Also there's no english dub, subtitles only.

However if you can get passed that NyanKoi is a lot of fun. This is the only season out I'm aware of and clearly the season ends with hope for a 2nd season. Generally it's your standard harem title. Several different girls all secretly love the one boy and hilarity ensues. The Japanese humor translates surprisingly well, but a western re-version could really benefit some of the jokes.

The ecchi and fan service never go over the line, but are here in ample supply. Character development is solid, and particularly the twin sisters are a riot!

The premisses is interesting: main character is cursed by the cat God. To lift the curse, he must help cats or he will himself be turned into a cat (he is allergic to them). This show is a romantic comedy. The characters are mostly one dimensional (too many girls are introduced but the shortness of the show excludes any kind of character development).This could have been executed better. Packaging is cheap considering the cost of the item. The special features are non existent (a few previews and that's that).

is not up to the standard of Umemaro or Appleseed, but they try.  I should explain I do not like cats and would never
be impressed by any work castng favorable light on them (e.g. they are FAR stupider than dogs - but smarter than sheep - they smell, scratch, carry fleas - like dogs - but they poop, indoors, in hidden places found only when your nose leads you there.).
My bias made clear, the DVD under discussion tries hard to amuse you and it might well work on another less subject to bias than I.  But I found too often the alleged allergy of the primary suspect is only operative now and then
(I must stress I am not subject to allergies so I have little understanding of HOW allergies affect other, lesser, men) but I noticed the lack of alergic effect on the subject character at times when his proximity dictated he SHOULD have
suffered - but the dramatic moment required that he do some act not involving sneezing, watering at the eyes, loss of
balence, etc, etc, which would have hindered his heroic duties and blown the plot trajectory.
Give this to your Aunt Tilly (the maiden aunt who has cats - but no alergies except to tree and grass pollens and not cat dander) or one of your enemies you don't really want to make peace with.",1338422400,,1364,4.341176470588235

8589360,3,B00D44IQLO,Cats can be adorable but also deeply mischievious. So what happens if you break the statue of a cat kami? Well you are on the receiving end of a curse for a start. This was intriguing enough to encourage me to buy the DVD. In the end this is less about the travails of Junpei Kosaka as he tries to lift his feline curse and more of an everyday harem anime. All the harem elements are present and correct. This is a shame as the original premise is much funnier and interesting. I wish I had seen this on a streaming service. I'm not sure I'd watch a second series if one were to be made.,1453680000,,587,4.068965517241379
