8541064,5,B009G17R4Q,"This is a charming example of a French musical with clever dialogues, a good story, a string of great songs and above all wonderful performances by both Mrtha Eggerth and Jan Kiepura, married in real life and both very famous singers. She was Hungarian, while he was born in Poland. Both had been both musical and cinema stars in Europe long before they played together in the 30s. With Nazi advances they fled to the States and finally established there, where he followed his successful operatic career and then they both became even more acclaimed together when they staged The Merry Widow for a long long time. The script (a successful musical star hires a Polish one trying to make his own career too to work as her bodyguard) plays with both their names and nationalities in an amusing way, the story is both interesting and high spirited and their rendering of the various songs, diferent for each style, is great and sometimes superb. Lucien Baroux, Arlette Berry and the rest of the supporting cast only make it better. Thanks to Gaumont for making it available ! Beware, French language & subtitles.",1466640000,,1109,4.78125
