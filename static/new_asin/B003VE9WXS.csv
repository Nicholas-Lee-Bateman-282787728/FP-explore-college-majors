4209145,2,B003VE9WXS,"The movie is okay. It starts right in action and you get whole hour of boredom until the moment where cards are revealed and you know what is actually going on in the movie. The special effects are not the worst and far to the best. However you can see, that the director actually tried to make the special outfit for the special forces and the graphics as told before are not bad. The monsters are boring looking however they look like monsters and it seems like he put some money in it. One of the actors had a very funny voice, hew was my favorite actor from the movie. Funny thing that when you think this movie has another hero, it actually does not and therefore a movie has some twists. I was thinking it is about aliens but no, closer to the end where truth gets revealed you realize it is far nothing to do with aliens or mutants. Well I watched the movie, and it got me bored to be honest, however you still can give it a chance.",1294099200,,939,4.164835164835165
4209146,3,B003VE9WXS,First off let me tell you I am Australian and don't have much of an opinion of Australian films If I had know this was made by Australianthere is no way I would have purchased it. Ok the film fist off I heard these strange accents yank Aussie New Zealand british and I felt the $20 odd dollars leaving my wallet this film was so Dark hence the title I guess only lights were the muzzle flashes a lot like that shocka with Johnny Depp about gangsters monsters dis not in any way look like the cover art but I give it a huge tick for non stop action I looked it up on line (after I had bought it) to find the Director only had a million to play with If he can do this with so little what will he do with enough money to get better actors I cant wait. Summing up I am glad that the money I spent will hopefully get this director some serious cash to splash on his next feature poss. who know what he can do  Al Watts presenter of Big Als Rhythm Roundup on PBS 106.7 fm radio,1291420800,,971,3.9289340101522843
4209147,1,B003VE9WXS,"This movie is a ripoff of ""Aliens"" and a few other sci-fi movies. The actors are terrible. The premise of the movie about finding a fallen angel could have been a good one,but the story goes nowhere. The characters don't seem too concerned about being killed or have any urgency to escape or defend themselves. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1287878400,6,349,4.555555555555555
4209148,5,B003VE9WXS,"THE DARK LURKING I LIKE THIS ONE ALOT IT WAS AWESOME!!!
you've got a kickass ride all the way through from start to finish
 It actually has the look and feel of many of our own low budget 80s hybrids ranging from CREEPOZOIDS to GALAXY OF TERROR, only with a real plot, cool effects, and dialogue that doesn't SUCK.
There's no shortage whatsoever of blood, action, treachery, and whatever else you crave in a movie
LIKE I SAID keep you interested from start to finish.
Things are for the most part played very seriously instead of going the campy route, and we as an audience totally benefit from that. For the first time in years, the Sci-Fi/Horror flick is truly back with a vengeance...HELL YEAH!!!!",1287705600,4,701,4.608

I could not help but enjoying this one. Believe me, there are flaws (including a total Doom rip-off plot that was ridiculous), but I felt this film still worked. Dark Lurking is an example of what can be done on a small budget, and it felt much more epic than it obviously was. Endless swarms of monsters and mutants, endless splattering blood and slime, decent characters, and some surprises re: plot and who dies. Good effects, a tense atmosphere...well done indeed. As in all low budget horror, you have to forgive some things- for example the fact that intersteller spaceships are stocked with 20th century pistols and assault rifles- but by and large the characters were engaging and acted fairly realistically. May not be for someone who is bothered by fairly constant gore and repetitive combat, but I would recommend if you want something intriguing, tense, and entertaining.

Kudos again to all involved for making this movie feel much bigger than it really is...",1433030400,,994,4.946107784431137

8406741,1,B003VE9WXS,"Low budget movie was so terrible, I couldn't even finish it. The DVD cover of the movie is a lie. There's no such creature in the movie, just bad actors wearing cheap looking make up. Save your money & avoid this piece of garbage.",1362787200,,230,4.25
8406742,5,B003VE9WXS,"It's apparent that blood, sweat, tears, and love went into pulling off this Resident Evil mockbuster on a tight budget.  Very fun stuff - including great sets and FX makeup.  Outstanding job to cast and crew.  Looking forward to your next one.",1357948800,,243,4.738095238095238
8406743,4,B003VE9WXS,"The cover art suggests Aliens, but it's more of a DOOM scenario, with creatures that would fit in that movie instead of ALEINS, and DOOM clones haven't been done to death either.  I don't know why people gripe about seeing yet another ""take"" on a familiar theme like ravenous creatures on board a ship.  If one counts the number of vampire and werewolf movies that come out every year, then we really do have something to talk about.  I looked forward to seeing this film and was not disappointed.  It took little time to get right to that action, and those slimey humanoid creatures are really great too look at. And for once, you didn't have to wait for half the movie to see them.  They are in your face right off the bat, and the camera gives you lots of great looks at them rather than shots so brief that you have to pause your player.
This movie is a hard one to seek out, as I wasn't even aware of it until I saw the title in an ""also available"" section on the dvd special sections of DEMME KING, THE SEA MONSTER. Thanks to Blockbuster for having it available to rent and to Amazon for having lots of good prices to buy.",1297123200,4,1128,4.252336448598131
8406744,3,B003VE9WXS,"Ton of action, lots of gore, and a few genuinely tense sequences. There's not a dull moment to be found, I kept jumping out of my seat. By the end I felt like I'd run a marathon. I am not a big fan of horror but this is pretty entertaining even for my scardy cat self..",1297036800,2,269,3.8214285714285716
