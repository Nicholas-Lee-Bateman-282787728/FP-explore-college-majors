8746994,5,B01AC6QXMU,This is a great show. I picked it up through Amazon UK. I wanted to confirm that this release of season 2 by Universal is Region Free. It plays on my US Region 1/A NTSC blu ray player without issue. Am glad as there is no equivalent release stateside.,1524614400,,251,4.142857142857143
8746995,4,B01AC6QXMU,"I do not want to provide any spoilers, so this will be a bit abstract.  This is the original French series, with very few actors that Americans would recognize.  It interested me originally because we live in the French Alps, in fact quite near to where it is supposed to take place; some scenes were filmed right down the road from us.

In the last episode of the first season, the returned walked into the night, menacingly demanding that one of the living come with them.  This starts 9 months later, with more dead returning.  The narrative is non-linear, with many flashbacks and innumerable characters who are evolving.  Some of them revert back to their original personality patterns, others are unaware that they were even dead, some have no memory of who they were.  To complicate things, the village has been largely abandoned and with the strange goings on, the military has become involved in an investigation that may impede the order of things that is emerging.  Though it seems aimless at times, the story advances and makes more and more sense.  Nonetheless, a complete explanation is never forthcoming.

As such, this is a very European psychological thriller that may not be to the taste or expectations of American viewers.  I like the fact that not everything can be explained, I didn't mind the relatively slow pace, and I enjoyed the consistent mood of the piece, which the fine actors create and maintain.

I think that the end was supposed to be transcendent, but it wasn't quite for me.  There are also some logical problems, such as the violence that is perpetrated and allowed, often by the living.  Yet much of it is indeed moving.  I would recommend this, it is a unique viewing experience.",1514505600,,1719,4.779661016949152

We tried playing it on the PS3 and still nothing. On my laptop and desk top and still nothing. This is very disappointing because my wife was really looking forward to watching this series. I think the disc's are bad, and if so that is not good business. I have spent quite a bit of money on Amazon and before this always thought it was great. Now I am not so sure. I am hoping Amazon will refund our money or give us credit or something and if they want the disc's back I will be happy to give it to them.",1455753600,4,670,4.083333333333333
