I have 4 copies! One for each car. The house and one for her travel bag and portable DVD.",1230768000,,220,3.8043478260869565
2690234,5,B000KGH098,"This is one of my son's favorite Elmo DVDs. The first segment, Friends, is great, because all the Sesame Street characters are involved and that always made him very excited to see Cookie Monster, Grover, Zoe, etc. I like the Singing and Dancing segments because of the variety of music your child is exposed to. The only thing I find slightly irritating is the opera singer teaching Elmo how to sing opera. It's a little annoying if you're doing something else and it's ""background"" noise. But that's far outweighed by the overall quality and content of the DVD.",1229385600,,563,4.755102040816326
2690235,1,B000KGH098,"We feel cheated by this Elmo DVD. Some of the episodes are from the same episodes of the Singing And Drawing DVD. I wish they had never done this. If this DVD is sold as ""The Best of Elmo"" we would accept that. However, it is sold as a totally new DVD. When you sell a new DVD, it is not cool to mix in old material. What value does that teach our kids? Very disappointed!",1226188800,8,372,3.9078947368421053
2690236,4,B000KGH098,"This disc has 3 Elmo's World episodes on it: Friends, Singing & Dancing.

Friends - Emphasizes the importance of sharing and taking turns.  Also features many of the Sesame Street characters bursting through Elmo's door at the beginning because they are ""Elmo's friends.""  Kristen Chenowith (from Pushing Daisies) is also in this one as Miss Noodle, Mr. Noodle's sister.  They learn to share and take turns on a swing.

Singing - This one was my son's least favorite.  There is a muppet opera singer that really freaked him out.  Everytime she showed up and started her high-pitched singing he shouted ""No!"" ""No!"" and made me skip ahead.  It got to the point where he wouldn't watch this one at all.

Dancing - Elmo learns about all different kinds of dancing: tap, the Hokey Pokey, and his favorite, the Twirl Around and Fall Down Dance.  (Now my son's favorite too.)",1223942400,12,868,4.76510067114094
2690237,5,B000KGH098,"I have been trying to teach my daughter that it's okay to play in her room with out mommy, i bought this dvd hoping that it would be fun for her to play in her room and have all the music and dancing, SHE LOVES ELMO, every morning and every night when we get home it's all about elmo...18 months old and only wants to watch elmo.....i would recommend this to anyone with small children who love to sing and dance.",1206403200,,413,4.111111111111111
2690238,5,B000KGH098,"My 20 month old son cannot get enough of Elmo.  Nothing else on T.V. holds his attention, not even Sesame Street until, of course, Elmo's World turns on.  He has watched this DVD a few dozen times and does not get sick of it.  I am sick of it though so I will buy him a couple more Elmo's World DVD's!",1203465600,,301,3.901639344262295

2690241,3,B000KGH098,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would contain new material that we haven't already seen on Sesame Street.  It's a pretty good collection of happy Elmo skits that would come in handy for road trips, but not necessary if you have a DVR and record episodes of Sesame Street.",1173571200,,278,4.450980392156863

You cannot go wrong.  This is one of the few DVD's out there that I'm not worried about subliminal messaging or being weird like 1/2 of the cartoons out there are.  Very pleased w/every aspect of this purchase.  Quality was impeccable as well.  I'd have never guessed it was used.",1381708800,,450,4.6923076923076925

2690299,5,B000KGH098,"My son is only 16months old & refuses to watch TV, which is good, in some ways. But after a few times of putting this on, he dances with it & actually watches it. Now when I say, ""want to watch Elmo?"" He goes over to the DVD player & looks for the movie. It is very educational as well, not just a TV babysitter. It teaches abotu sharing, taking turns, different types of singing & it incorporates kids of all ages. I highly recommend this DVD",1294012800,,443,4.103448275862069

2690301,5,B000KGH098,"My 26-month-old daughter has had this video for over a year now, and is still not bored with it.
The title makes it sound less interesting than it actually is -- it should be called ""Friends, Singing and Dancing"". (There's one section about each.)
As a former Special Ed teacher, I particularly like the fact that the ""friends"" section features some special-needs kids, but not in a patronizing way. They're just friends, like anybody else.
The singing and dancing parts are great, too -- you'll love Elmo doing the hula!",1262563200,,521,4.8
