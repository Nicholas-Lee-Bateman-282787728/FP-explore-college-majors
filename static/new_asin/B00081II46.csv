8355825,4,B00081II46,"This DVD was produced in the 1990s, so your not going to get fancy menus or special effects.  Still the production quality was good.  The form of Kenpo shown is different then the American Kenpo of Ed Parker. I would classify it as an old school approach to Kenpo.  The DVD has a good number of techniques which incorporate hard strikes with stand up grappling.",1224806400,2,361,4.523076923076923
