6094198,4,B00GNDUTX6,"The film's thesis is that city planning must be of, by, and for the people. Through examination of various cities around the world, it reveals the pitfalls of traditional city planning by experts for business and financial interests. (Think of skyscrapers and concrete canyons, as pedestrians scramble across massive boulevards between automotive herds jamming wide, long expanses of asphalt.)

Hints of change in planning, purpose, and design are also examined. The possibilities of cities designed around human needs -- movement, exercise, interaction, socializing -- are explored in real urban case studies.  Some reviewers complain that the solutions presented are inadequate. No doubt. In part, this is because the solutions are still in development. And in part, this is because there is no ""one answer"" for all cities.

That brings us back to the thesis: cities must be designed and planned by and for those who will live in them. For those with some background in sustainable development, this film will confirm your values and ideas about city planning. For most viewers, this is an extremely useful and beautifully filmed introduction to the concepts of sustainable, human-scale city planning.",1420243200,,1203,5.388297872340425

6094235,5,B00GNDUTX6,"I grew up Detroit and you are what you drive. The city itself was decimated not only by riots,racism,unemployment,and being a one horse town. It was also decimated by the wide swaths of expressways designed for those who worked downtown to get back home to the suburbs without stopping. The automobile itself is largely responsible for the demise of Detroit. Inside of Detroit is a city called Hamtramck and surprisingly has been spared the decay that the area around it has not. I have no problem parking my car anywhere in it and taking a walk any where in it. We need to rethink the city and build it around people and not around cars.",1412812800,,638,4.556521739130435

This video expands greatly on the concepts presented in the book.  Having traveled extensively I have seen first hand the negative effects of urbanization on a global level and how unsustainable our current model of city planning is.  This video shows and explains perfectly what I am speaking of.

6094247,5,B00GNDUTX6,"Insightful documentary, and I like how more cities are looking to provide people open spaces to interact and enjoy life. Hope more Amazon members watch this, so they can get involved in their own cities to demand change in the future.",1412121600,,234,4.7317073170731705
6094248,4,B00GNDUTX6,Interesting documentary relating to city planning.  The film reminds us that cities consist of people and considering their needs in the design of these urban centers should be paramount to ensure their vitality and success.,1412121600,,224,5.4

6094255,5,B00GNDUTX6,"Its a great start to increase awareness that as city dwellers we can change our city landscape.  It points out the myopic ignorance of city planners through the present who blindly prioritize vehicles over people and that it is habit based on assumptions and not a thoughtful decision. It ,helped me realize my frustration with the city bus transit situation in Honolulu.  Now I realize what offends me with it is that it's planning prioritizes vehicles along with the usual money concerns over people making it unnecessarily difficult for riders to use and therefore less likely to use it.",1411948800,2,590,4.94949494949495
6094256,5,B00GNDUTX6,I thought it was very interesting and made me more curious than ever about the future. I still believe that humans will make the right choice in the end. I would definitely recommend seeing this.,1411948800,,195,4.6
6094257,2,B00GNDUTX6,The beginning was intriguing and there were some nice shots but I ended up losing interest quickly. It felt like the same points and problems kept being mentioned yet nothing went anywhere or discussed interestingly. I couldn't get passed the 1 hour mark.,1411862400,,255,4.953488372093023
6094258,1,B00GNDUTX6,"I was hoping that I would like this but they struck out.  It should have focused more on a few cities than trying to depress us with the utter poverty in Bangladesh.  It started out with Copenhagen but it did not get into depth of what change or how they did it, the NYC scene was slightly better.  Then I thought they were going to counter balance NYC with LA, another mega city but this one designed completely for the car and their struggles to change, but they only focused on a take back the streets event.  This movie is a huge disappointment, also the Christchurch segment left me wanting to know what happened, should not have been put in the doc without conclusion.  The movie should have focused more on 5 or 6 cities,  an old Italian one and how they built it 1000 years ago, Copenhagen or a city in the Netherlands that went through the change of mindset around 1970, NYC(not just Manhattan but Brooklyn too), LA(how it is trying to change from auto focus to pedestrian focus) and Detroit of what can happen when car oriented development goes unchecked.",1411862400,4,1065,4.492227979274611

6094260,2,B00GNDUTX6,"I enjoy violin music yet this music was repetitive and annoying.  I expect the one who made this movie got a large sum of money from Obama and pocketed it.  Considering that that one of the first people who was interviewed, Mark Gorton of NYC (who is a hedge fund investor and has a whole lot of bad light shining on him, based on my research), I find the sincerity lacking.  Mark Gorton made a sarcastic claim that our world was a disaster because humans make it a disaster.  There are many improvements I have seen and I think his sarcasm was made to take the heat off himself as being a non-ethical businessman who has enjoyed funneling money to himself.  There is nothing wrong with being rich.  Yet there is everything wrong with lack of sincerity and honesty.  Though the film spoke about some solutions, it dragged out as if it needed to invoke the viewer to be depressed.  Meantime, the film-maker has pocketed his big cash from the government and considers this an opportunity to throw business to the mental health industry.  I don't recommend anyone to waste their time watching this.",1411776000,,1095,4.603092783505154
6094261,5,B00GNDUTX6,"An excellent film with valuable and insightful content. While they do give some examples of possible solutions of their own, it seems to me that their focus was more on getting people to realize that this is indeed a serious problem and that it will get even worse. And that we should start finding alternatives now before it is too late. The beginning of the film is a bit slow, as they build a foundation and explain where they are coming from. But once you get past the first third or so of the film it becomes very watchable and interesting.

Note: I think these 1 and 2 star reviewers didn't give the film a complete viewing. The film is, admittedly, a bit slow at the beginning. But the last two thirds or so is quite watchable, informative, and interesting.",1411776000,,764,4.457142857142857

6094264,1,B00GNDUTX6,"They didn't demonstrate the speakers' ideals in the film. The film didn't show that what they highlighted worked, leaving open so many questions about the projects.

In one project the speakers talked about converting a lane of traffic in Chongqing, China, for part of a pedestrian route. But then the speaker showed that the lane was put back to its original use. Why? Was it better before the changes they suggested? They didn't follow up. Did they implement any more routes?",1399852800,4,477,4.888888888888889

8625074,4,B00GNDUTX6,"I was recently browsing the documentary DVD section at my local library in search of something interesting to watch, and fell upon this. Certainly the sleeve jacket picture of a city upside down caught my attention, but then when I read what this was about, I thought that this could be really interesting, and I decided to pick it up. So glad I did.

""The Human Scale"" (2012 release from Denmark; 77 min.) provides a renewed look at how to plan and build our cities, as seen through the eyes and the vision of Danish urban architect Jan Gelh and his colleagues at Gehl Architects. The opening images, combined with the stirring soundtrack, made me think of the movie ""Koyaanisqatsi"" from the early 80s. Soon thereafter, we dive into Chapter 1 (of 5), where the movie makers look at how cities in China have changed (don't call it progressed) in a compressed time period of just 30 years. Chapter 2 looks at Copenhagen and New York, and it quickly becomes clear what the movie makers' perspective is, assuming you agree that the way we build cities influences our daily life and our quality of life (which I agree with). The before and after pictures of the changes in Manhattan are fascinating. Chapter 3 looks at Chongoing (China), Siena (Italy) and Melbourne. Chapter 4 brings us the challenges facing Dhaka (Bangladesh). But the best is saved for last: a fascinating look at what is going on in Christchurch, New Zealand. I'm not going to tell you what, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

In all, at just 77 min., this documentary flew by in no time and I enjoyed it for the most part. Yet I also was bothered by two particular things: (1) the documentary is in essence one long commercial for the services of the Gehl Architects firm. Couldn't the movie makers really not find anyone else to provide other perspectives (even if they are similar to Gehl's)? (2) In the documentary, the point is made several times that the ""gold standard' of urban planning is of course Copenhagen (""can X be the next Copenhagen?""). Really? I find it incredibly self-serving, when you realize that this movie is made/produced by Danes and that Gehl is also Danish. Plus it's presented like a matter of fact, when in reality this is a very subjective conclusion and I'd venture to say that there are quite a few cities in Europe that are not all that different from Copenhagen in its urban lay-out. All that aside, if you have any interest in urban planning, I'd strongly suggest that you check out this documentary, and draw your own conclusion on all this.",1429056000,5,2569,4.643956043956044
