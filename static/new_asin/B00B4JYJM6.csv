5555323,5,B00B4JYJM6,I found myself gripping the armrests more than once in this thriller. What a great film. What great performances. This is a definite must-see movie! Big thumbs up.,1433116800,7,163,4.857142857142857
5555324,5,B00B4JYJM6,This built up tension and was a good horror. It was made with plenty of twists. Certainly well worth watching.,1396656000,6,110,4.55

5555326,5,B00B4JYJM6,Spirit Stalkers is not just any horror movie.  It keeps you going and makes you believe in one ending then throws a loop for a totally different ending. The movie kept my attention and with each viewing I see something new.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror and wants a story.,1359590400,6,299,4.418181818181818
5555327,4,B00B4JYJM6,"""Spirit Stalkers"" is an independent film from Big Biting Pig Productions.  Steve and Pj with the help of Felicia and locals have captured the reality of the difference between paranormal investigation teams then mixed in horror and humor.  The end result is a wonderful film with a horror of an ending--all of this without the use of CGI.  I bought several copies for me and friends.  It's a movie that I have watched and enjoyed over and over again.  Now, I'm anxiously await thier next movie, ""Lucid"".  Enjoy!",1359504000,7,511,4.75

You catch yourself peeking out of one eye waiting to be scared.  The actors are great!  Have seen several of the films from these writers and each one is by far better than the last.  You won't regret watching this.  Definately worth adding to your collection.  Are you scared???",1359504000,7,417,4.554054054054054
5555329,3,B00B4JYJM6,It's not a bad movie. It's just that it seems like the local theater guild got together and made a decent ghost hunter movie. I liked it. It reminded me of something that would make a good TV show.,1498348800,,197,4.076923076923077
5555330,2,B00B4JYJM6,"I got about a quarter of the way through this movie before I had to turn it off.
It was... not very good. The acting wasn't horrible to start, but it got to this scene were this guy keeps repeating I love you, over and over again, and without giving anything away (on the off chance you really want to suffer through this movie.) it ends in the single worst b horror scream I have ever heard, with some of the worst 80's b-rated horror sound effects.

At that point, I was laughing so hard I couldn't take it even remotely seriously, and it just didn't have the same kind of cheese as the ""so bad it's good"" b movies. So yeah, I had to tap out.

If you're feeling froggy and want to try to plow through this movie, I wish you luck.

I nearly stopped watching after 30 minutes but I'm glad I didn't.  The pace quickened and the rest of the movie had a couple nice twists and turns.  I wouldn't watch it again, but it wasn't a complete waste of 90 minutes.

5555343,3,B00B4JYJM6,"There's movies that are just bad in every way possible. Then, there are movies with a decent idea, but they clearly lack the proper funding for the production it deserves. Spirit Stalkers is one of those films.

The camera work is amature at the best of times, you can tell they were shooting on a budget. The audio was sketchy at best, sometimes the music or effects played too loudly, sometimes the actors spoke so softly you couldn't hear them. This caused a constant fluxuation of turning the volume up or down.

 Some of the actors were decent, none of them were amazing and some of them were downright horrible. From their dialog to their body language, you could tell that at least some of the actors were friends or family instead of someone with experience.

With that being said, the story isn't a bad one, the concept was good. I'll give them credit for not resorting to jump scares and crummy night vision shots, which is very typical to these kinds of movies. It was an alright movie that kept my attention to the very end, even if it did move slowly on some parts.

As a free movie on Amazon, I can't dislike the film. But I would never recommend it as a video rental is this somehow happens to show up in RedBox or your local rental location.",1475280000,5,1257,4.424242424242424
5555344,3,B00B4JYJM6,"Keep on Stalking...

Ok, so found footage based around a television ghost hunting series.
The supernatural isn't fully explained in this but you do receive a lot of character back ground that helps to explain some of the lead's actions and thought process.
It also looks at the integrity of honest investigation vs media glorification for ratings so that gives it a sort of 'message' plus.",1475020800,2,389,4.893939393939394

They are going to ""help"" a mother and daughter living in an old supposedly haunted Victorian house.  The mother also has some mental issues.  Do the ghosts cause her to be more crazy or does her illness cause her to hallucinate?  Some of the actors are more talented than others, the camera work is good enough and I loved the house itself.

5555351,2,B00B4JYJM6,"I try to support Indie Horror films and I understand low budget, but this was a little beyond low budget. I'm sure they could have stretched for a tripod. The story was actually really interesting, but I feel the poor production quality took away from what could have been a great film. I feel Steve Hudgins acting was the only decent acting in the film, many of the characters had me groaning because it was too terrible. There's a certain art to a terrible horror movie that's good and this just didn't have it.
It was not a ""shaky cam"" movie, but there was certainly a very shaky cameraman. It often brought me back to reality during scenes that were not meant to be seen through the ""Ghost Hunter TV Show"" cameras. It also confused me making me think that the camera was seeing through the ghosts eyes or even one of the ghost hunting crew members, but it wasn't.
But like I said, I really did like the story and I felt it could have been a great film. However, it's free with your prime account and I love spending my time watching the worst horror movies I can find. So this fulfilled my need for a terrible horror movie.

5555353,4,B00B4JYJM6,"Found this movie here on Amazon Prime and in the last 28 hours I've watched five of the Big Biting Pig Productions flicks. Like a lot of the reviews on here will tell you, it's not your typical high-budget horror flick. It's more like a group of friends got together and decided to make a horror movie, and they did something I found to be rather original for the first time in years. The story is an original take on the often-used concept of a movie following the exploits of a ghost-hunting television show. It was refreshing to seem some ingenuity brought back to the horror genre! Some of the lines are, admittedly, pretty silly, but I think that endeared this movie to me as more of a cult horror movie. Even if this movie isn't your cup o' tea, check out some of their other ones. I've been quite entertained over the last many hours. :)",1470441600,3,844,4.382165605095541

Spirit Stalkers was released four years ago, which was the last time I watched it. This movie is like a creepy old school 1960's haunted house ghost story. (In fact, I would recommend watching it in black and white) A woman named Gloria Talman begins seeing and hearing things around her house. Pretty soon, the Spirit Stalkers come to investigate. The 'Spirit Stalkers' show is close to being cancelled, so they need to find real supernatural activity if they wanna beef up the ratings. Is the house really haunted, or is Gloria just crazy?

5555371,2,B00B4JYJM6,"This film is about a team of paranormal investigators with their own TV show. As such, it is understandable that the film is blurry and out of focus, if it's going for the found footage effect. The problem is that it's not a find footage film - if it were, the characters in the scene would react to the character presumably holding the camera. Throughout the film, the character in the scene is oblivious to the shaky cam, and this ruins the effect.

The acting is okay, but the video and sound quality are poor. While I don't insist upon top-quality audio and visuals, at the very least the filmmakers need to make best use of what they have. Sadly, this is not the case.

The plot is slow and boring. What's more, it isn't scary. Sure, unexplained things like doors opening on their own and strange sounds occur, but none of this achieves a good scare.",1464652800,,855,4.439490445859873

The only reason I watched this, was that I'd recently seen ""Frances Stein"", and liked it so much, I looked for other movies done by the same Production company, Big Biting Pig Productions. I have to say, the movie was genuinely creepy / scary - a bright spot in an over-crowded genre.  The plot was original, with good twists, and good flow. It was intelligently done - something very difficult for a movie of this type. I thought the acting was good (indie film or not).

Unfortunately for them, when they did encounter a real haunting, it got mixed up in the staged shenanigans of members of the crew, and they all ended up greatly regretting it.

This one started slowly (as most horror flicks do), but it consistently built up tension. Practical effects and makeup were okay.

5555396,1,B00B4JYJM6,"This was my first Prime movie, chosen equally due to the fact that I'm jaded by big-budget horrors and because I had a research report due that I didn't feel like writing. I thought that, due to the 4 and 5 star reviews, I may have stumbled across a hidden gem but that wasn't the case.

The production value is lacking, but it's a low budget film, and I often like that ""real"" look. But what took away from the story was really the acting. Case in point (no spoilers!) there's a scene early on where the mother bumps into her daughter and starts screaming, and the daughter says, ""Ah! Mom what's wrong, what's wrong Mom?"" in a barely-above conversational tone as her body language reads stiff as a board and thoroughly uninterested. I'd say the main roles had pretty good actors, though they might have benefited from a few more rehearsals (or perhaps a couple fewer? Maybe they were tired of it all) because they sometimes came off as being too scripted. The smaller roles, like the daughter, the daughter's boyfriend, even the father, were off-putting and, as another reviewer mentioned, so bad they were sometimes funny.

The storyline was actually kind of refreshing, and it had some potential. I was disappointed, but it did its job as procrastination fuel since I wasted an hour and a half on it and even more time writing this review, which will get a lazy, snarky response from Ocean View saying ""The actors have won multiple awards and director of Friday the 13th something something irrelevant said it was scary as hell. Thanks for giving it a chance."" I'd give much more movies by the same team a chance if my opinion as a viewer wasn't poo-pooed.",1454198400,2,1659,4.620338983050847

5555403,4,B00B4JYJM6,"I have watched some BAD, BAD movies lately. But what the heck, they're free on Prime. and has some time to kill.

This WAS GOOD. on 10 thousand dollars??? I've lost that and made that in the market in a week when I used to trade. (not very wealthy, trust me, but I did ok)

I would have gladly paid the 6 bucks matinee price at my local theater for this.

It scared the heck out of me in more than one scene.

I'm from NYC. I don't scare easily

Sometimes I HATE that these movies aren't made with a few million and some Once Grade A actors.  Though the acting wasn't bad.

But with a little more talent, and some more money for camera wor and special effets, this could have been a blockbuster.

I thought Blair Witch SUCKED. and it REALLY sucked compared to this.

Twists and turns. And even the few times you knew what was coming, it was still scary!!!

Spoier: don't read further!!!!!!!!!

stop here!!

I wish I knew if the ghosts were evil or if there was something bigger than the ghosts that casued them when they were alive to kill because of a mental weakness. It was pretty obvious there was something a little off about the gal in the show's group.  Not sure why the other older bald guy was able to channel them, AFTER he was dead. that was a little confusing.

Watching independent low budgets IS a lot like trading. You watch and watch and watch and you get the bad trades/movies, and out of nowhere you get the big score that wipes out all the bad ones and puts you ahead of the game!!! all about patience.

A VERY GOOD horror movie is a special rare thing. Too bad this wasn't in the theaters, as most of the ones I have seen in the theaters STUNK!!!!",1452297600,2,1667,4.214511041009464
5555404,5,B00B4JYJM6,"Very creepy, well done independent film. This is a low budget movie and you can definitely tell - the acting is iffy in some parts and the editing is a little choppy, but overall this was a very good film. I thought Spirit Stalkers would be a run of the mill found footage movie, but it's definitely more than that - there are some genuinely creepy moments, a couple of interesting twists and the ending is excellent and very satisfying (also a little sad). Steve Hudgins directed and wrote this film and he also plays the stubborn and sometimes overbearing Reuben, a man who has dedicated his life to disproving spiritual hauntings and has his own show that is slowly circling the drain and is on the verge of being canceled. I liked the progression of this character, who is sort of unlikable at the start of the movie but becomes more human and sympathetic later on. I also really liked P.J. Woodside's portrayal of the mentally unbalanced Gloria Talman, a recently divorced single mom to a teenage daughter. Gloria and her daughter live in an old, beautiful house and the movie starts off with weird bumps in the night that may or may not be a figment of Gloria's imagination.
I'm glad that I gave this movie a chance! Great job to the cast and crew! And as a Tennessee girl, I was happy to see that this movie was filmed here in the South, right up in Kentucky.

Edit 12/27/2015: Edited to add that I am not part of the cast or crew and had absolutely nothing to do with the making of this film.

This one was much better than movies with a much bigger budget, which was also mentioned by other reviewers. I must admit I got bored halfway through and started playing games on my iPhone though. But at the same time I have a short attention span so keep that in mind. I actually tried watching this once and after seeing the dodgy/weird camera work that is very low quality at the beginning I turned it off. But after running out of horror movies I gave this one another go and it was one of those movies that is best described as good for killing an hour or so. I will say though that with the low quality cameras used and the extremely low budget, they did a pretty good job of creating an eerie scene with creepy elements in it.

These people do a heck of a lot on small budget, and while their movies are pure horror genre flicks, they do try to bring something original to the story each time. Some people take issue with the acting and bits of the script...again,  this isn't Hollywood and they don't have Hollywood resources, so instead of nitpicking I try to see what is good in these diamonds in the rough. One thing I really like about these movies--if I may say so in a guarded, non-spoilery way--is that they aren't afraid of dark endings.  I don't just mean in terms of death count--some of the dramatic context and character flaws in these movies are really twisted.

Finally, I do respect how the production team just OWNS that they shoot in Kentucky.  I'm sure they get a lot of unfair grief for shooting somewhere many probably regard as 'backward,' but they totally run with it as they deftly make the setting and culture a part of their stories.

She's a nice lady, daughter Kellie is a nice girl with a nice boyfriend; no hidden dark sides or twisted motivations in these characters. Without the Spirit Stalkers team, it would have been a pretty bland and depressing tale. One that seems to repeat itself at intervals, given the clues uncovered during the movie. I guess they were trying to go for creeping dread, but during this first act all I felt was sympathy for the unwell Gloria. Once the Spirit Stalkers entered the narrative, the pace quickened and I really enjoyed the characters. The ghost story didn't unfold in the way I expected, the personal journey of Reuben didn't go where I expected, and the betrayal of trust actually surprised me.

The acting was mediocre for the most part, but it wasn't worse than anything you'd see in an A-list horror movie, and the leads turned in some good moments.

Imagine this movie with a 'face lift'! I think it'd do quite well at the box office, actually.",1438905600,2,456,4.922077922077922
5555474,3,B00B4JYJM6,"Yeah, it's okay. Here's the long and short of it. Stay with me here...

I want to preface this review with one admission that I am regrettably a horror film junkie. However, I'm constantly searching for films in this genre that are legitimately scary on a psychological and cerebral level. I can't stand it when films in this genre don't respect the viewer's intelligence. The scariest movies are the ones that effectively plant an idea in your head that you could be in danger from an unseen and intelligent force. You have to tap into a person's inherent, primal fear of the unknown. So the common gag of a sudden crash of glass, and a reveal of a broken glass of water that was still on the patio table in the backyard with no explainable way for it to break probably should be coupled at some point with knowledge that the girl that died that house was drowned in the pool by her father, who then went into the house an shot himself. Now there is purpose for the jump-scare. The spirit had a reason for breaking the glass, it was deliberate. The water was a symbol hatred to her... and 'you' put it there. That all has nothing to do with THIS movie, but hopefully illustrates my point that sometimes presenting the viewer with unsettling information makes seemingly innocuous events send a chill down your spine.

Anyways, let's get on with it...

It took me the first 30 seconds of this movie to realize it wasn't part of the ""found-footage"" sub-genre, but had me fooled for a moment. The reason being, the video/film quality is quite poor throughout and the camera is very clearly being carried around by someone. I suddenly found myself wondering why the person in the shot wasn't reacting to the person carrying the camera? Oh... because there isn't anyone there.

So basically, throw cinematography out. It's not good here. There are times when the audience shouldn't distracted by the obviousness of the camera. A number of the close-ups are somewhat, awkwardly close. The staging of certain shots don't feel right or aren't edited together very well. It just comes across very amateurish and rather distracting.

As for acting - I feel bad for saying this, because this is very clearly a film made on a budget by an exuberant new film crew in an industry that does NOT embrace up-starts, but it's also just not very good here... amateurish. It's amazing what subtleties come into play that make an acting performance go from fantastic to dry script-reading. I suppose why I feel bad for saying the acting is poor is because there WERE times when it wasn't all that bad and I found myself engaged in exposition. Clearly, acting is WAY harder than it looks.

But all that aside... this story... is -well-thought-out! The writing really is the saving grace here and I thankfully became aware of it very early on. In terms of the ""spooky"" stuff that happens; it's well paced. Starting off slowly with subtle, unnerving unexplainables then transitioning to a jarring event on the stairs (for what it's worth, i won't spoil it), followed by a seance that goes slightly awry that spurs an intervention with a psychic until finally this crew of paranormal investigators are brought in, who just so happen to be dignified, hopeful skeptics. Throughout all of this, the scenes with main and even secondary characters nearly all appear to have meaning and purpose. There ARE some parts here and there that probably deserved to be a little more fleshed out, but nothing criminal. No strange characters appearing from nowhere, delivering some piece of exposition then disappearing from the story entirely. A number of the characters actually have story arcs... some are even likable... and they are MEANT to be likable... it even has some likable characters doing some unlikable things when a plot twist is introduced. All these things show that there was careful consideration in the development of the story, and it really does pay off.

So to wrap it all up, I'd say that the story and story telling here is done with enough consideration to balance out the negative aspects of this film and rate it as a passable independent horror/suspense film. If by some weird chance this film were to be re-made by this film crew, utilizing some better cameras and better camera techniques (which CAN still be accomplished on a budget), bringing in some better actors, and maybe adding another 15-30min of story/exposition to round out some of the characters... maybe let some scenes ""breathe"" with mood-setting establishing shots... this could be a really decent flick worth watching again. And to be honest.... I've seen enough trash in this genre to know this one does deserve some credit. Seriously... just for a measuring stick... see if you can stand 'Spirit in the Woods'. THAT one... is absolute trash.",1438732800,,4800,4.810909090909091

That being said though, I really did enjoy watching this film regardless because it's evidently a labour of love. It's good fun and it looks like the group of people who put it together had a lot of fun doing it too. The actors and actresses really put their hearts into playing their characters and you can't help but like them because they're just your everyday average joes. For such a low-budget production, the effects were incredibly innovative. The plot was also pretty original. Definitely not your run of the mill horror movie, but not quite a scary horror movie either. Granted, towards the end, it does get quite exciting.

I'm a filmmaker myself, and I believe this would've been an awesome movie... but it wasn't because of the following:

*Dialog writing: OMG nothing... and I mean NOTHING hurts me more than generic unrealistic dialog. Lines were SUPER CHEESY AS HELL and many of them unnecessary. All the characters sounded as if the same person was speaking.

*Character Development: Other than Reuben, no other character was well developed. Every single one of them seem flat and unrealistic. all of them make terrible choices. And just because Reuben has some sort of Character development going on, it doesn't mean that It's the best in the world.

*Acting: Acting was okay. Maybe it would've been a lot better if the actors had a better script to begin with.

*Editing: OMG I honestly lost count of how many times they violated the 180 degree rule and eye line!!!! It freaking bothers me and it confuses the s*** out of your audience. maybe the editor wasn't responsible since he probably didn't have enough footage. If that's the case, the DP is to blame for such a filmmaking sin!!!! However, the editing pace was all over the place too. So I blame both the editor and the DP.",1436313600,,1352,4.663865546218488

Everything was made with cut-corners, and it shows in such a shoddy and ill-conceived production.

I have always stated that it takes a special kind of team to create a true, well-made film; you have to be talented, have the passion and have the foresight to know that money should not be an object when you are dealing with your dream. Even the most cheaply made movies that are entertaining have a talented team behind them, and this movie had NOTHING. Everyone's acting stunk, the script was cliched, and the make-up was amateurish to the point of making me laugh.

There is no redeeming quality about this film, other than for me to say that had this been made by a talented, competent and deeply-pocketed team, it would have not been a total disaster. As it stands, it is a true testament to why some people should not bother making movies, and why some people are not meant to be stars.

The TV show's production is reminiscent of Spinal Tap - one cast member attracts young women, another - the woman - has migraines, the lead wants mysteries that are unsolvable, and the producer can see his career sinking.

Do people get paid to do this? The way this movie is filmed looks awful. The actors/actresses in the movie shouldn't even be called that. The woman that owns the house may be the worst actress I've ever seen, literally ever. Every time something bad happens you get a loud special effect that's apparently the only one they had because they repeat it several times throughout the movie! The movie is very poorly made and has zero B movie horror charm or humor factor. It's also very slow and boring.

I watched this movie for free, but I felt so cheated after watching it that I felt the need to write this, in the hopes that someone might see it and avoid this. I like bad horror movies.

The acting, mostly average, at times above, great job by the director and the crew there, as they really work through which look were potentially some rough spots.  The camera angles and music score were executed well in many areas providing the creep factor where and when it was needed most.  They story line and originality were outstanding IMO, they provided the actors and the crew a great path in which to follow with very little if any holes. the small twists were pleasing as well.

They don't do blockbusters with million dollar special effects budgets; they tell great, fun, and well cast, stories with some good scares.

5555606,4,B00B4JYJM6,"This film was cheaply made.

No, scratch that. This film was INEXPENSIVELY made. It is not cheap. Cheap indicates something that is both of low-price and also low-value. This film looks like it was made for $10k and a lot of free pizza and beer, but it's surprising how much it delivers. The actors are solid, the script gifted with an unusual amount of originality in a crowded genre, and the directing is largely damned good.

So good in fact that there are many scenes that are downright creepy and scary, and that's saying a lot coming from me, as I'll watch splatter films while eating spaghetti. Good, bad, and ugly, I'll watch 'em all at some point, in the hopes of finding the rare gem in the pile of manure.

Well this here is a diamond in the rough. It features a new twist on a tired story---that of paranormal ""experts"" staying in an allegedly haunted house. The twist is that the experts are stars of the reality TV program ""Spirit Stalkers"", who face quite the conundrum: viewers tune in to each episode hoping to see ghosts, but instead the Stalkers keep on finding rational explanations such as creaky floors, bad ventilation, and so on. Their ratings are plummeting and it's looking pretty glum when a choice ""haunting"" falls in their laps.

This haunting has everything: things that go bump in the night, a house with a tawdry history, furniture being moved after a seance, and even a psychic investigator is freaked out by the place. Wouldn't it be great if this place were really haunted?

Well, it might be for the ratings, but not so good for the crew or the people living in that house. Oooh, creepy stuff happens, but I won't spoil anything by telling you what.

Now, I'll warn you: this movie is really rough. It's obviously very low-budget, which means bare-bones makeup, bare-bones effects, and the best actors that pizza can buy. But damned if these guys don't make it work most of the time. I personally would have made one more editing pass on the script, but the writing is surprisingly strong and the directing genuinely scary.

If these guys were a corporation, I'd buy their stock because I know I'd be getting in on the ground floor. Steven Spielberg got his start with the television movie ""Duel""; James Cameron got his start in ""Piranha 2: the Spawning"" (check it if you don't believe me). Someday, people are going to look back at Steve Hudgins's career and be amazed that he started with such humble budgets.",1433376000,27,2447,4.637413394919169

5555611,4,B00B4JYJM6,This was pretty entertaining for an obvoisly low budget movie.  Nicely creepy for little to no special effects with a little twist near the end that you may or may not see coming.  I've seen some pretty awful low budget films here and this was a nice surprise.  No one here is wining an Oscar but I found it entertaining enough to recommmend for a rainy Saturday afternoon,1433376000,8,372,4.4411764705882355

5555613,2,B00B4JYJM6,"the story was ok, but takes some time to get interesting. not really any scary parts to it. the actin was not great even for a no name cast and the dialog is not very good either. I would never recommend this film to anyone. I saw all the stars it had received so I watched it for free and I feel like I still got ripped off. This is the bottom of the barrel for low budget horror. after being disappointed I checked the profile of some of the people who gave it 4 or 5 stars and discovered they were involved with this high school AV club quality movie. only recommend on amazon prime and only if you have nothing better to do",1433289600,2,627,4.024

8562379,3,B00B4JYJM6,"So I watched a paranormal investigator style horror movie today, who would have guessed that?  The acting I won't say is bad, instead I'll say it's green... at first I thought it was going to be one of those low budget religious orientated horrors where they preach mental illness is actually paranormal, something along those lines, but it doesn't go that way, and ultimately it turned out to not be a bad story at all, and actually rather enjoyable once you make it past the cacophony of the amateur which many would find insurmountable... I say give this one a shot.

8562381,1,B00B4JYJM6,I'm shocked by the amount of decent reviews for this. The movie had a 1980's tv feel to it. That is not meant as a compliment. House of the Devil had that same vibe but it worked. I almost quit before the end. The actors were bad. Wooden would be ....well they should aspire to be wooden.

8562385,4,B00B4JYJM6,"I expected this to be a rip-off of Grave Encounters, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that the resemblance is only superficial and disappears a few minutes in.

Most horror films are lacking in ideas for their run time.  Spirit Stalkers suffers from the opposite problem; it really could have used another 30 minutes or so to establish the characters better and avoid the feeling that the movie is being rushed.  Still, if the balance cannot be perfect, it's better to have too many ideas.

Also, it is tempting to fault the acting, and in places it is noticeably threadbare, but a bigger issue is the sound.  Put any actor in a small room with bad acoustics and no soundtrack, and he will sound like a high school drama student.",1505606400,4,733,4.564885496183206

8562387,4,B00B4JYJM6,"Low budget for sure...  But I REALLY liked this as one of the cooler ""ghost hunter"" stories that I've seen so far...  Better than a lot of other flicks I've seen that I'm SURE have WAY bigger budgets...

And as for people saying the camera work was bad...  I thought it was actually ""reasonable""...  I had more problems with the audio going from quiet to loud all the time...  I wish they would learn how to normalize it a bit in a lot of these B rate movies ( seems to be a common problem )",1500163200,5,491,4.0625
