4702650,1,B005HP6QI8,"In my opinion, The movie relies solely on Rider String's cuteness. Two problems - the storyline was pitiful & those teenage smiles don't quite pack the same punch they used to.",1431043200,,176,4.709677419354839
4702651,3,B005HP6QI8,I don't know what to say about this movie I only watched it once. I didn't fully grasp the content of this flick. To be fair I won't give a negative review I'll have to watch it again to make sense of it.,1342137600,,204,3.7674418604651163
4702652,1,B005HP6QI8,"Oh my goodness what a waste of time it was to watch this movie. I don't like to give bad movie reviews but this movie is so bad that I felt compelled to write a review.  Half way through I started to fast forward but then thought I should just watch the darn thing since I've come this far.  HORRIBLE!  Just horrible is all I can say.  The cinematography was so bad that it was difficult to actually watch.  The music throughout the movie was, well I can't find a word that describes how awful it was. The acting was just as bad.  It would be interesting to see Rider Strong in a better movie.  My advise is to skip this movie and go for something else, anything else.  You'll be glad you did.",1335830400,3,693,4.119402985074627
4702653,4,B005HP6QI8,"The movie opens with what appears to be a grainy film of a routine child alien abduction. Years later Eric (Rider Strong) is living with major league babe Lisa (Ninja Cheerleader Maitland McConnell). Lisa is paying for Eric's education which has changed from a medical degree to one in cultural anthropology which includes UFO studies. For some strange reason she is having doubts about the relationship and is as moody as Eric.

Then one night, Eric dreams that an alien has abducted her. Lisa is missing. Eric then teams up with the goth chick next door, Beth (Danielle Keaton) who claims her boyfriend was abducted too. They search for answers as there appeal to be shape shifting reptoids among us!!!!

I enjoyed the film which is why I gave it 4 stars. It is not a four star quality film for most people. I liked the characters. I liked Lisa wanting her space in a convincing manner. I also enjoyed the neighbor Harold (Charley Rossman) and all the other fruitcakes in the movie.

There is a considerable amount of first person narration throughout the film on the history of UFO abductions...Betty and Barny Hill for example. I liked the drone sound track which makes more sense toward the end of the film. The shape-shifting special effect was cheap, but I thought it worked.

A few F-bombs, sex, no nudity (Danielle Keaton naked back) I enjoyed this ""1 star"" movie, hence 4 stars.",1335312000,2,1388,4.723140495867769
4702654,4,B005HP6QI8,"My wife and I sat down to watch this thinking it was an action movie, which is how it was categorized at our Redbox. Turns out it was actually a nice little piece of sci-fi with enough twists and turns to keep us well-entertained for a couple of hours. Absolutely recommended.",1326931200,,276,4.431372549019608
4702655,1,B005HP6QI8,"I almost can't believe that I sat through this entire film. I also have low expectations when it comes to alien/sci-fi flicks, however, this one blew my frickin mind how horrible it was. The quality of the movie seemed like it was filmed in someone's basement with an old school 8mm camera. The aliens were terrible and kind of made no sense.

I can't stress enough that nobody will like this movie, no one! I'm actually pissed I spent $1.10 at Redbox on this thing! I just keep thinking about the things I could have done during that wasted 2 hours of my life.

Also, the dude from 'Boy Meets World' needs to get rid of his Justin Beiber haircut. I'm just saying.",1325548800,6,664,4.390243902439025
4702656,1,B005HP6QI8,"As a long-time fan of any film dealing with alien invasions, and any variation, my standards are pretty low.  I don't require a lot of character development, am fine with lapses of logic and am pretty well satisfied as long as the film gives the requisite thrills expected in any alien related film.  This goes back to films from the 1950s up to today, and includes some critically panned recent releases such as `Skyline', `Battle: Los Angeles' and even the redundant prequel to `The Thing'.  However, as non-discriminating as I am, there are SOME standards.  And this film failed to meet even the most basic of them.

Where to start?  The premise seemed intriguing (a Ph. D. student investigating the `modern myth' of UFOs and aliens only to find them real and with a sinister agenda).  That's as far as it got, however.  The film doesn't deserve too much wordage, so in a nutshell: everything about this film is awful.  The screenplay was lame, the `acting' (such as it was) was embarrassing; the main character (going by the name of `Rider Strong'), who also fancies himself a `producer' with a credit) seems to have two acting styles...he's either silently walking around as if he smells a perpetually foul odor, or in speaking parts, doing his best to act like an a**hole.  The lead female is just as bad, very amateurish.  Both of them looked like unkempt sheep dogs with hair covering their eyes.  The cinematography was basically dim lighting, making even mundane things appear threatening.  The soundtrack was a constant drone of ominous-sounding music without any accompanying scary elements to support.

The film threw in all kinds of references to seemingly alien-related phenomena (cattle mutilations, for example) although they had nothing really to do with the movie.  I kept looking at the clock thinking `when is this bilge going to end'?  Okay, so the few fleeting scenes of the aliens were not bad, but not enough to salvage this amateurish bit of dreck.  A complete waste of time.",1324252800,11,2001,4.872781065088757

4702659,4,B005HP6QI8,"Though not a mainstream film, this science-fiction drama has strong merit and displays a unique approach to the ufo abduction genre.  Directing and camera work is well-done and emphasizes the moods within the production quite nicely.",1486684800,,233,5.472222222222222
4702660,2,B005HP6QI8,"This got 2 stars only because of some of the more humorous aspects of the script.

We have a theoretical physicist giving (off campus) lectures to a bunch of alleged alien kidnapping believer/victims.
He probably got his degree from Head Hunter University of Papua New Guinea.

There's also a scientist formerly from M.I.T.; former being the operative word here, doing the same.
It's not difficult to understand why he is ""formerly"" of M.I.T.

This all brings to mind the comedy series ""The Big Bang Theory""

Also, the aliens are hostile and all too reminiscent of the phage (diseased) ravaged race called the ""Hirogen"" who harvested healthy organs from their prey on the Star Trek: Voyager series.",1485388800,4,698,4.991379310344827

8473389,3,B005HP6QI8,"This film somewhat makes up for it's micro budget with a good lead actor and a wicked twist ending. Rider Strong puts in a strong performance, his character demonstrates fear, angst and bewilderment punctuated with bursts of anger. Watch closely, the story leaves intriguing breadcrumbs. The supporting actors were ok but I admit his Elvira impersonator sidekick was an odd character choice (you'll know what I mean if you watch this:). Give this a shot as long as it's included with Prime.",1516320000,,490,4.987804878048781
8473390,4,B005HP6QI8,"This is a low budget sci-fi and dramatic movie. Told from the main characters point of view -Eric (Rider Strong)
This was given 4 starts because the director/writers want you to start thinking that is just a typical evil alien/ufo story where aliens are harvesting organs.
Upon a second watch and  paying attention to details it seem much more likely that Eric is suffering from Mental illness or a growth in the brain.
He imagines seeing aliens instead of the people around him. He gets migraines and talks to Beth the neighbors niece who really isn't there.

It is a fun movie to watch but if from a pyschological perspective it is much more enjoyable.",1514592000,,654,4.678260869565217
8473391,4,B005HP6QI8,"Not action packed, more like an Ex Machina - leaves you wondering. I thought it was a decent flick. Better than reviews indicate if you like slower-paced, thought provoking movies.",1510185600,,180,5.033333333333333
8473392,3,B005HP6QI8,"Three stars...with reservations. Low budget...and it constantly reminds the viewer. It's a tedious task to watch this thru to the end...good luck.

8473396,3,B005HP6QI8,"...not sure where they hoped to take this movie but it never made it. The problem seems to arise from wanting to tell a story about alien
abduction, and then switching it over to the neighbors niece who seems to take the movie in a different direction. Overall, I would rate this a B
sci fi movie. Could have overlooked the amature acting if the story would have kept its focus. Give it a shot if its late night viewing you want.",1506384000,,429,4.2439024390243905
