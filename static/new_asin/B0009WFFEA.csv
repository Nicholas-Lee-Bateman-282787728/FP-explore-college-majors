Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.

This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good. Ikki Tousen is a very entertaining anime to watch, but as I said it's main purpose is fan service.",1354665600,,734,4.357664233576642
8068117,5,B0009WFFEA,Totally my own ignorance. I received the shipment in a timely manner and in excellent shape.  I thought I was getting a Season that was earliar than what I already had but it was just an earlier publication. :(,1285027200,,210,4.384615384615385
8068118,4,B0009WFFEA,"First, let's say if you have a school girl/upskirt/panty fetish, then you will love this series. Each episode has plenty of panty peeks, perhaps a bit over the top, especially during the fight seens. In all seriousness, this series is based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Five Kingdoms. At times the plot is difficult to follow and it is often hard to sort out the names of the many characters, but this gets sorted out in time. Also, great opening and closing music scores. All in all, an enjoyable anime series from Geneon.",1237766400,,538,4.614583333333333
8068119,5,B0009WFFEA,"this box set is awsome! its a good anime to start, with alot of fan service and action be aware IT IS NOT FOR KIDS read the age lable on the box! but by this box set for $71 instead of the dvds seperatly! you will save $50 so buy it you won't be dissapointed.",1161129600,7,259,3.727272727272727
8068120,3,B0009WFFEA,"The story basically revolves around 6 dominant school in and around Tokyo, Japan, where gangs and stables rule schools and battle each other to prove who's the king of it all. Pretty imaginative and a pop-cult adolecent fantasy if you think about it, but then again, there's a twist - they all have avatars that once belonged to legendary warriors in the Sangokushi era. The avatars give them each unique powers and fighting abilites.

Ikki Tousen - Battle Vixen is about a girl called Sonsaku Hakufu who transfers into one of the 6 dominant academies and quickly sparks unwanted trouble with her untamed power. She just so happens to be the most powerful fighter while at the same time being the most dense. She battles against some of the academies' top fighters, eventually forming an unlikely friendship with the Big 4 - a foursome of powerful fighters residing in the academy she's in - and uses her avatar to battle ""evil"" and perverts. There's tons of colorful characters and the episodes are mostly containing flashbacks to illurstrate the characters further.

Whether or not the show will pick up for another series is bewildering, but what you have here is a mild story anime with plenty of sexual refrences and the most unlikely protagonist in anime history. It's worth recommending if you're a fan of shows like Full Metal Panic/Fummofu/Alchemist and Gantz. Overall, this anime is entertaining and basic. It's no Cowboy Beebop or Ghost in the Shell, but if you're looking for teenage humor and martial arts, purchase this product.",1144800000,21,1542,4.926923076923077
8068121,4,B0009WFFEA,"As other reviewers have said the series is about seven schools constantly at war with one another.  Each school has its own set of skilled fighters that seem to be guided by the fates and souls of warriors from the Sangokushi period in China.  This particular story focuses on Sonsaku Hakufu, a recent transfer student to Nanyo academy.  Hakufu is definitly not the brightest girl you'll ever see, but she seems to have a honest heart & a great love for fighting.  But like the other fighters in the series she has to deal with the destiny of the soul she possess.

I'll be straight with you, if you're looking for a deep plot then this isn't the anime for you.  If you're looking for a nice, fun series then you might want to check this one out.  The series has a nice concept, and actually has a likeable cast of characters.  My only real disappointments with the series is that the fights while decent are really nothing spectacular.  Also the dub really isn't the best i've ever heard, so you might want to stick with the sub.  Other than that I found the series to be very enjoyable.

If you happen to like the anime, you might want to check out the manga which happens to be leaps and bounds of over the anime.",1141776000,9,1216,4.36
8068122,4,B0009WFFEA,"This anime's plot seems to be lost somewhere in the background.  I found it to be providing humour.  If you enjoy counting the number of times you are tempted with female underwear exposure.  Then this anime is for you.

If you are looking for quality of plot.  Then this anime is not for you.  The plot seems to be some adaptation of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms set in some city in Japan.  Basically,  'du wa?'  You can follow it easily, but it seems to be silly.",1140825600,11,470,4.25
8068123,5,B0009WFFEA,"Seven schools are constanly at war with each other, and the students within both male and female have become skilled fighters and constanly battle with rival schools.
