7948078,2,B00005NVHM,"Along with Chiu Man Cheuk's Body Weapon film, Fist Power could've been great. Chiu is a very talented fighter and practices the same Wu Shu as Jet Li, he's been known as the heir to Jet as well. He took over Jet's duties as Wong Fei Hung in OUATIC IV & V and did a pretty decent job, and he even fought against Jet in Fong Sai Yuk which was pretty awesome. However, he has a few so-so flicks of his own. Fist Power is about an ex military official (Anthony Wong) who holds an elementary school hostage because he wants to see his son(not biological, but raised him), who is being flown to America by the mother and her mobbish husband(biological father of boy). Cheuk is a professional security trainer who has a nephew that is at the same school. Wong and Cheuk know each other prior to this, and Cheuk decides to bring back Wong's son before he will supposedly blow up the school. The rest of the film is Cheuk fighting off bodyguards and other baddies sent by the mobbish husband to prevent the boy from seeing the father. This could've been a great film, there were plenty of fights, some decent humor, and a really pretty girl. The problem? The camera shooting and choreography. It's god awful, you can't even see whats going on. For example, Cheuk would start an awesome kick and just before it hits his opponent, the camera would black out (flash out) and then you'd would see the opponent fly back as if he was hit without showing the hit. There is a lot of no contact showing in this film and thats too bad because Cheuk shows off some of his best stuff I've ever seen or almost saw. Theres one fight in the dark where he just lights a lighter for a little view of the several guards in the area, and he takes them all out, but all you can see is a little kick or punch here and there. The camera work is just pitiful, all of Cheuk's best moves would just be cut off showing no contact as if the director wanted this to be a PG movie or something. I suggest a viewing before even thinking about buying this. Who knows, maybe you'll like the camera work. All I know is that it frustrated me and 2 stars is the best I would give it. For better Chiu Man Cheuk flicks, check out Fong Sai Yuk along side with Jet and OUATIC 4 & 5. Hope this was helpful, check out my other reviews too, mostly HK flicks.",1011139200,4,2307,4.221719457013575
