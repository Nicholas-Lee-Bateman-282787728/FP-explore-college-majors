8147124,4,B000IONJLA,"This 5-DVD set, united only by the theme of ""Glamour Girls"" (and even that theme doesn't fit Margaret Sullavan's role in her film), is a wild mixture of very different films from 1930 (The Blue Angel) through to 1951 (Pandora and the Flying Dutchman).  But every one of the films is a good film, and most of them are better than good -- very good to excellent.  And because some of them are little-known today, their excellence provides a pleasant surprise.  I'm always delighted when a film I've never even heard of turns out to be so good that it instantly becomes one of my favorites.

The plots and other aspects of these films will be summarized adequately in other reviews here, and a long review can be found on the DVD Savant site.  I'll just say that the genres vary from tragic drama (Blue Angel) through bouncy musical comedy (Love Me Tonight), through proto-screwball comedy (The Good Fairy) and London-set suspense/murder mystery (Lured), to dark and magical fantasy-romance (Pandora and the Flying Dutchman).  You will want to watch these films on different occasions when you are in very different moods!

I did not buy the set for The Blue Angel, which I already had in the deluxe KINO edition (which contains both the English and German versions and many special features).  The Blue Angel in this set, it turns out, is just the English version and has no special features -- so if your main reason for buying this set is for The Blue Angel, get the deluxe KINO version instead.

As I said, I did not buy this set for the Blue Angel, but for the other films that I had not seen before -- or even heard of.  I knew of no other way to get the Lucille Ball/Boris Karloff collaboration, Lured, and when I read the positive reviews of Love Me Tonight and The Good Fairy, I decided to take a chance on the set.  I'm glad I did.

Love Me Tonight is a great early talking musical, and while the quasi-operatic singing style of Jeannette MacDonald is hard to get used to, if you can overlook that, the Rogers and Hart score is delightful and the script is incredibly witty -- as 1930s scripts so often were, especially before 1934.  Also, the DVD is loaded with special features (including detailed discussion of censor-cut scenes which would have made the movie even funnier).  The Good Fairy is a proto-screwball comedy, with an original plot, and wonderful supporting players, including Frank Morgan, whose casting as the Wizard of Oz was surely influenced by this film -- where he even talks about wizards in one scene!  You can't help but smile at this movie, it's so gentle and funny.  Lured is a first-rate murder mystery:  Lucille Ball (who has never been so beautiful) helps Scotland Yard try to find the mass-murderer who killed her fellow dance-hall friend.  There are suspects aplenty, and the supporting cast is wonderful:  Charles Coburn, George Zucco, Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia, and the ever-smooth and vaguely sinister George Sanders.

Finally, the Pandora film is a very unusual one.  Normally I wouldn't chase after anything with Ava Gardner, but she is good in this one, and more important, it is an extremely well-filmed movie, with wonderful color, sets, location shots, etc. and excellent music.  It's very moody and atmospheric, alternating between crisp realism and spooky fantasy.  I'm in the minority that thinks that James Mason -- one of my favorite actors -- was miscast in this film, with a delivery unsuited to the character, but nonetheless, his workmanlike job is well-enough done that it doesn't harm the overall effect of the picture.

The downer in this set is the quality of two of the prints.  Lured is generally watchable, but hasn't apparently been worked on at all, and shows all kinds of minor flaws in picture quality.  Pandora and the Flying Dutchman is in very bad shape in spots.  After a beautiful Technicolor opening, some dark night scenes soon follow, and you can't even see the Dutchman's boat from the top of the cliff, because a smeary greenish-blackish blob floats in the middle of the screen for most of that scene.  There are other places where the picture goes dark, including one where three people are climbing a hill in broad daylight and you can't see their faces.  Clearly this film needed a DVD restoration.  This version is the 2000 KINO version; I understand that KINO restored this in 2010 in DVD and again recently in Blu-Ray.  I would like to see the later restorations, because I think the photography in this film is magical and it's a shame to see it marred by a poor DVD issue.  So don't buy this set if it's mainly Pandora you are looking for -- get one of the later restorations.

Except for Love Me Tonight, the special features here are minimal or non-existent.  Lured does not have even a trailer.  But the special features on Love Me Tonight are so good, and the quality of the movies overall (script, acting, directing, etc.) is so good -- every one worth at least 7.5 out of 10, and three of them deserving 8 out of 10 or better -- that, even with less than optimum restoration of some of the films, this set rates 4 out of 5.",1421366400,3,5136,4.662597114317425
8147125,4,B000IONJLA,"The actual films were not quite what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised with  Lured ( Lucille Ball) but a bit disappointed with Blue Angel ( Marlene Dietrich). The others were good and the delivery was prompt and efficient. I particularly liked Love Me Tonight -- again a film that shows the simplistic values of the time, but honest performances by all the actors -- big and small. The box set was exactly as advertised.",1355097600,,425,4.666666666666667
8147126,2,B000IONJLA,"I bought this set because I thought I would be getting PANDORA AND THE DUTCHMAN at a bargain price. Not so. This set does not contained the ""RESTORED"" PANDORA, but a ridiculously dark print with far too many jump cuts with lost dialogue. I should have opted for the Restored version. And THE BLUE ANGEL is the English version only. In other words, this set is not a ""bargain"" for serious collectors. On the other hand - if you're not picky and only want to see these two films for their storylines, this set may be all you need.",1348617600,,528,4.343434343434343
8147127,3,B000IONJLA,"This set only contains the English version of the film.  You still need to shell out $31.00 for the earlier KINO release of the film that has  both the German and English versions. If the superior German version had been included, this set would have received a 5 star rating.",1165363200,14,276,4.5
