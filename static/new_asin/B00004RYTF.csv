1344375,1,B00004RYTF,"Maybe, just maybe, this could have been a good movie in the right hands. Somewhere buried deep was a plot. The dialogue was cheesy and the acting was amateurish. It was too ""David Lynch""!Not funny enough to be a comedy, and not serious enough to be a drama. And the ending just leaves you hanging. The budget had to be $1.00, which, ironically, was the denomination of the coin he kept flipping. I forced myself to watch it hoping against hope that I could find some redeeming quality, but, alas, I could not. I ended up throwing the tape in the trash.(I didn't even rewind it!) I couldn't bear to inflict this pain on anyone else.",1150416000,,631,4.448275862068965
1344376,5,B00004RYTF,"you're gonna like this movie! All is not what it seems in this road thriller. Every actor is cast perfectly. The story unfolds nicely and calmly, and then shifts---at the flip of a coin. A twisted tale where situations appear as one thing, but really soething sinister is going on. It's really difficult to talk about a movie with alot of plot twists without ruining it. All persons involved with this project deserve a high-five for a thrilling suspence movie!",1122681600,9,461,4.775
7921530,4,B00004RYTF,"Recalling the first time I saw this movie, I thought of a tense thriller involving a killer whose methods presaged the approach of the killer in No Country for Old Men. However, when I bought this film and viewed it again, I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't quite as good as I remembered.

Its an uneasy mix of the offbeat and the realistic  of the quirky and the disquieting. The killers descent into insanity seems to almost comically parody The Shining more than it suggests the impersonal implacability of No Country for Old Men.

However, Robert Forster is always interesting to watch. I became a fan of his during the days of his Banyon TV series where he played a jaunty 1930's detective. He and Amanda Plummer develop an unusual chemistry here that will probably hold your interest and carry you along to see what happens next.",1503878400,,836,4.635135135135135

7921532,4,B00004RYTF,"Not for everyone .... a really bizarre but well made film. The veteran acting and cinematography are excellent with a great ensemble cast. Lots of twists keep this movie interesting.

A woman in the SW desert has car trouble and is picked up by a seemingly nice guy. They become romantically involved while other characters weave in their sphere. Ultimately there are murders as the tension builds up.

Not for small kids.",1459123200,,422,4.847222222222222
7921533,3,B00004RYTF,"The previews looked promising so I bought this DVD.  About halfway through this film, I began to figure out who the good and bad guys were.  Amanda Plummer (Christopher Plummer's daughter) was excellent as was Robert Forster who seems to have disappeared from the Hollywood scene for several years.  The movie will keep one interested, but I personally hated the ending; almost too Hitchcockian for me to accept.  I won't disclose just how it ends, but I would never, if directly the film, have selected this predictable ending.",1433980800,,528,4.965909090909091
7921534,5,B00004RYTF,"American Perfekt is such a great movie-a nine piece child's puzzle with each piece slid on the table one by one and some on the table to begin. Forester is great. Fairuza Balk is watchable in just about any role. IE Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead. The movie is very hard to find in the original  1.85 : 1 Aspect Ratio.

No one has in their libraries online. 2 years ago Netflixx had it online in the 1.37 : 1  Aspect ratio give or take a point.

Coen Brothers got the ""Call It Coin Toss"" from Forester character Jake in this movie to use in No Country for Old Men. I did find a supposed 1.85 : 1 Aspect Ratio with about 25% margin around the aspect ratio. Blowing it up to fill the screen made it to grainy so it is the best I have been ever to do.

and by the way .... what are playing for.....Great Movie!",1383177600,,817,3.957317073170732
7921535,4,B00004RYTF,"Sadly, American Perfekt was but nothing more than a little direct to video thriller. Somehow the movie surprised me. I had fun watching it the first time and still am when rediscovering it years later. One must admit that the first half of the film looks more like a necessary dose of yawning in order to have some clue what's going on during the second part. But if one dares to give just one little chance to this flick, the last hour might caught your attention, surprise you. I really appreciated for my part. This is still and always my opinion that many so called movie critics rather just rate a direct to video flick 4/10 instead of finding a reason why they should watch it but...

What got me into this one at first is obviously the wonderful cast: Robert Forster (Jackie Brown, Mullholland Falls among others), Fairuza Balk (The Island of DR. Moreau, The craft, Almost Famous, American History X), Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction), David Thewlis (The Island of DR. Moreau, Harry Potter, Kingdom of Heaven) and Paul Sorvino. And trying to imagine this movie, just try to portrait in your mind a great version of ZZyzyx Road or try to imagine Tarantino going rogue and making a murder/mystery flick. Kind of strange and complicated? Well the movie ends up being fairly simple.

Jake Nyman (Forster) plays a psychiatrist on a road trip during which each decision will be left to chance and taken with the help of ""A FLIP OF A COIN"". On her part, Sandra (Plummer) is en route to meet with her younger sister Alice (Balk) before continuing and going to meet their mother. Traversing the deserted roads of the country is Jake, that will soon after Sandra gets pushed off the road by a mad man, help her and decide (With heads or tails) to pick her up. Jake's immoral and ""Leave everything to chance"" attitude excites Sandra from the get go and she's immediately turning into Jake's wild girlfriend, if only for the lenght of their trip. The 2 carefree will even run into a mad cheater... That all until Sandra mysteriously disappears and Jake picks up her rather suspicious sister Alice.

Lets assume the audience has a minimum of brain, we already know what happened and we believe we know what's to come. The last hour of this little jewel gives (without any sort of pretention) magically life to a movie that was screaming from the start to get some of its fresh air out. Truly, it seems like this movie has been holding its breath for the first 40 mins or so and let it all out like some spit from the very 40th min and until the end. Sad on one end but on the other, it results into a pretty refreshing and rewarding piece of film-making. And rest assure that a lot of BOZOS took the field and just hit and missed by trying to compare this one to books and actual Oscar nominees flicks, when American Perfekt had nothing taken or stolen from any of this. But was at the very least vaguely inspired by any movie involving suspense, a desert, a tuff chick, a coin flipper (Which was rather deeper than inspired but written and developped into making the coin a more or less important character for AP.)

Yeah, a movie based on people leaving everything to chance might have worked better in the sixties (They sent Neil Armstrong on the moon for the love of God.) But look what type of stuff we have in the RATED 18+ and FOR TEENS department nowadays, 16 years after 97 (The year when AMERICAN PERFEKT was produced.) If we haven't made any step back, have we really understood anything about chance and made any step forward??

8/10 If you are like me, HEADS: PICK IT UP RIGHT AWAY. TAILS: NOT SO FAST, YOU MIGHT HATE IT.",1365206400,,3625,4.511415525114155
7921536,4,B00004RYTF,"If you see that Amanda Plummer is in a given film you can pretty well figure you've left Kansas. That is way the case here.

Here's the scoop. Plummer is on her way to pick up her troubled sister (Fairuza Balk) and take her to see their mother. On the way she's run off the road by a crazy (David Thewlis) and immediately her car door is blown off by a doctor (Robert Forster) who is on a hiatus and will make all his decisions by flipping a coin. He works on getting her to a motel and getting her car towed, but who is he really? A rather harrowing odyssey ensues.

I have enormous respect for good writers, and when I see a film like this, that respect increases exponentially. The story itself (my mundane synopsis notwithstanding) is so crazy I need to wonder who could think of such a thing. And the dialogue is every bit as good. Though the stories are different, this reminded me a lot of ""The Music of Chance."" Both films are just plain nuts. The acting here is also very good. Plummer is her usual good self. Robert Forster has a scene near the end, where he is unraveling, that left me nearly breathless. Paul Sorvino, Chris Sarandon and Geoff Lewis lend strong support as well.

There are some weak spots but they're crushed by the great stuff. The ending will no doubt infuriate a lot of people. I don't quite know what to make of it, but it's no crazier than all that came before so I guess it fits. The director, Paul Chart has directed very few films over a very long period of time. How he got the green light on this is a mystery, but I'm glad he did. This is one heck of a watch.",1338076800,3,1598,4.198697068403908
7921537,5,B00004RYTF,You will either love it or hate it. I loved it. This movie is quirky and as predictable as the flip of a coin.,1270598400,,110,3.625
7921538,4,B00004RYTF,"I caught this film on cable a while back and finally got around to watching it on my DVR. The film will remind some of the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino films with its off the wall characters and familiar cast in such films. It's a very good film, but the only flaw I can see is that I kind of knew who the real bad guys were from the beginning. It doesn't make it any less enjoyable and fans of CB and QT should enjoy this quirky and refreshing film. It's not hard to see a little of 'No Country For Old Men' in this film and having Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction) and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) will certainly bring Quentin Tarantino to mind. A surprisingly good little film that you may have never heard of.",1270339200,6,717,4.240875912408759
7921539,5,B00004RYTF,"One of my favorite films. If the picture had done any business, Robert Forster would have been nominated for an Oscar. It's a quirky and more than a little off-beat film - not really a a mystery so much as a strange adventure film. Give it a chance, you'll love it. And where else can you see Amanda Plummer naked?",1223596800,6,314,4.25
