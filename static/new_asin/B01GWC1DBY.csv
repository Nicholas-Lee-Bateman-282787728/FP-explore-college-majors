William Wallace was born circa April 3, 1270 at Elderslie, Renfrewshire, Scotland.  Wallace was 6 feet 5 inches tall.  Reportedly, Mel Gibson is 5 feet 10 inches tall.

Robert the Bruce was born on July 11, 1274 at Turnberry Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.  In 1302, Robert the Bruce submitted to King of England Edward I aka Longshanks.

In September 1297, Wallace defeated the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge.

In July 1298, the English defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk.

In August 1305, the English captured Wallace at
Robroyston near Glasgow, Scotland
Wallace was executed by the English on August 23, 1305 at Smithfield, London, England.

King of England Edward I aka Longshanks died on July 7, 1307 at Burgh by the Sands, Cumberland, England.

His son King of England Edward II and Isabella of France married in 1308.  Their first child, the future Edward III, was born on November 13, 1312.

Prince, later King of England, Edward II was born on April 25, 1284 so he was 21 years old when William Wallace was executed.  He was 22 when he became King.

Isabella of France was born in 1295.  So Isabella of France was 10 years old when William Wallace was executed.  There is no way Isabella of France and William Wallace ever met much less anything else.

So this movie is wrong in claiming that Edward I sired any of Edward IIs and Isabellas 4 children & Edward IIs one illegitimate son.  Yes, Edward II and Piers Gaveston are thought to have been lovers, but that didn't stop Edward II from doing his dynastic duty.",1528416000,,1617,4.714285714285714

Bodies litter the battle field. William Wallace is knighted for this victory. He objects to the squabbles among the nobles. Wallace invades England and attacks a fort. The English forces are annihilated, York was sacked. King Edward II rejects his sons military advisor. Wallace has a dream at night of his dead wife. Wake up, William she says.

This movie runs too slowly at first. It would help if you knew something about this history. Was Wallace betrayed because the nobility had more in common with each other than their subjects? Some violent scenes are too explicit even if simulated.",1527638400,,3420,4.731543624161074
