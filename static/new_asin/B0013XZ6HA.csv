The documentary made them visualize the doctors and also share their worlds'.  Along with being helpful to my students, it was well done and gave you a glimpse of how the doctors lived now that they are men.",1221782400,6,316,4.413793103448276
3120171,3,B0013XZ6HA,"I haven't read the book, but this documentary is not a rehashing of that book.  It really speaks about life after the book became immensely popular.  You see the doctors going to speaking engagements and mentoring younger African Americans.
Like the book, this will really inspire viewers.  For me, I liked how they ""kept it real.""  None of them turned their backs on less fortunate Black folk.  They still embraced African-American vernacular and culture.  None of them said, ""Now that I'm successful, I want to be like Clarence Thomas on Condi Rice!""  Watching the doctors lift as they climbed will warm the hearts of many.
Having said that, I am still concerned about some of the things I saw here.  The work shows the doctors at an event with Bill Cosby.  In fairness, the doctors never say they wholeheartedly embrace Cosby's preachings.  Still, even in the Black community, critics have said the Cosby is becoming conservative and somewhat classist.  RuPaul wrote about how bitter and angry Cosby was when she met him.  Cosby may have overestimated the impact that his sitcom was going to have on the nation.  So to bring in Cosby muddies issues, rather than clarify them.  This documentary might have been stronger without him.
At one point, one doctor changes shirts while driving to an event.  Yes, it shows that he has a lot of demands on his time.  Still, that was unethical to do as a driver.  If he had killed another driver that way, then his medical career and ability to mentor would have been cut short.  If you arrive to an event in your white lab coat, what's the big deal?  I hope young viewers don't think they can take their minds off the road because this doctor did it.  I was very disappointed seeing that.
The work does end showing that the doctors are going strong in their field, however, this work implies that they really want to mentor more than they want to practice.  If they kept busy in the hospital, maybe they could become presidents of those hospitals.  I'm worried that they reached a level and now just want to encourage others to do the same, rather than trying to reach even further heights.  They are non-doctors who can tell young people to think big.  They may open more doors by focusing on medicine, rather than trying to only do it part-time or on a limited basis.",1221350400,6,2312,4.637931034482759

3120178,3,B0013XZ6HA,A documentary.  Bought for students to compare and contrast the book and DVD.  Expected to see actors portraying the events.  Got more of a one perspective commentary of their current life.  Somewhat disappointed.,1421625600,,213,5.363636363636363
3120179,5,B0013XZ6HA,"This documentary is based on the true story of three young men who became doctors despite the odds and obstacles from the mean and cruel streets of Newark, New Jersey. They wrote a book about their pact and determination to succeed and become doctors. In this documentary, they take the audience to the streets and neighborhoods of Newark, New Jersey known for a high crime rate, poverty, and homelessness.

The documentary displays the statistics where only a small percentage of the doctors in Newark are African Americans. The doctors here actually live in Newark, New Jersey and are proud to call it home. While they could live elsewhere, they chose to return and help back in their neighborhoods. The three doctors have remained friends and colleagues all throughout their lives and returned home rather than turn their back on their past.

This documentary was aired on PBS television. There is a small featurette in the special features section.",1416441600,,952,5.018987341772152

3120181,5,B0013XZ6HA,"This documentary impressed me very much. It's the true story of three boys living in the rough streets of Newark, New Jersey, who make a pact with each other to go to medical and/or dental school after hearing about a special program at Seton Hall University that offers free education to promising minority students. Luckily, they are all accepted into the program. Even then it is not a given that they'll succeed, and they freely admit that they could not have completed schooling and residencies without the support and encouragement they gave each other.

I see from other comments that the film may have been shown to young people who would rather see an action movie. Please don't let that discourage you. This is a film that could make a huge difference to the right young person and if others are bored, so be it.  There are precious few stories of African American youth who find ways to get out of poverty and despair.  This is a true story, not a feel-good fantasy that can easily be dismissed by kids who see too many negatives on a daily basis and can see through fictionalized accounts.

I have not read the original book ""The Pact"", but I did read ""We Beat the Streets"", which is a youth-oriented version of the book, ghost written by an author of books for young people. It gives a very real understanding of the temptations offered by street life, and how difficult it was for the ""Three Doctors"" to overcome it.  I recommend ""We Beat the Street"" for younger kids and will order ""The Pact"" (the original book) in order to compare the two.",1409616000,,1556,4.58273381294964

3120207,4,B0013XZ6HA,I teach the book The Pact to my ninth graders and this is a nice end of unit addendum.

3120209,5,B0013XZ6HA,"The Pact shows the real lives of three amazing men who are beating the odds.

3120210,5,B0013XZ6HA,"I loved how the film documented the current and the past lives of the fantastic three doctors.  Bringing real people from their past forward to strengthen their journey and validate their messages shows the youth of today that the three D's and the choices we make, like the friends to hand with and the opportunities to grab hold of, really can make a difference. The high point of the video for me was when they turned down a movie deal because they thought it would muddy the message they wanted their people to know is genuine.

The documentary also completely failed to address what this ""pact"" was. Call me a cynic, but I almost wonder if it was a marketing publicity ploy. While I think they did overcome difficult odds to achieve their current positions in life, I also wonder if they are commercializing upon it a bit too much now to gain resources and less on their practices - in short, almost like ""celebrity doctors.""

8253273,5,B0013XZ6HA,"This documentary film illustrates the unvarnished truth about growing up in poverty. The allure of getting out of "" the hood"" tempts youths to do damn near anything to leave those roots behind, even if  the escape is only temporarily. Unless you come from such a background, you may not relate to such a movie. The lasting effects of childhood poverty is not sexy topic at all;however, these young men do more than justice to paint the very realistic picture of what is means to ""beat the streets."" I was so unfortunate to beat the odds myself, and I loved this movie and the message of hope that it inspires.  I also plan to share this film with all my Health Science classes. I applaud these three gentleman for having the courage to tell their story.  This film is awesome!!",1481846400,,777,4.535714285714286

8253275,5,B0013XZ6HA,The cost was unusually high. A ten dollar DVD priced at fifty dollars. The enjoyment my students showed after watching the video was priceless.,1475625600,,143,5.0
8253276,1,B0013XZ6HA,"I loved the book but i was disappointed and digisted with this movie. Granted my hopes weren't very high considering it was a lifetime movie but this was truly awful. The only similarities between the book and this movie was the title. It didn't follow the books story line...not even slightly. They should have just changed the name of the characters and the movie and it might not have been as huge a let down because it wasn't even loosely based on the book. Additionally the acting was terrible, story line terrible...just awful awful awful. If i was the books author i would sue.",1475366400,,584,4.625

8253278,5,B0013XZ6HA,"The entire movie would have been better if more time had been allotted to flesh it out.  It wasn't amazing, and it wasn't horrible.  I, however, do need to admit that I watched it because I think Megan Mullally is phenomenal, and she was.  I can recommend it from that point of view.",1473292800,,283,4.30188679245283
