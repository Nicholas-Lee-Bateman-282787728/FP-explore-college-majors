209307,5,6300155447,"Nothing matters about this film except for one thing - not the plot, not the screenplay, not the directing or editing - it's the stunning performance of the 17-year-old Emily Lloyd, in her first movie, that makes this film one of my all-time favorites.

This is one of those rare performances in which, whenever Lloyd is not on the screen, one simply tunes out, waiting for her to come back center-stage to work her magic.  What a joy she is to watch.  It's a pity her career was cut short by mental illness; I simply cannot think of another actress who could have done what she did in this movie.",1358985600,3,597,4.409090909090909
209308,5,6300155447,"This film deals with serious issues about death, sexuality, conditioned attitudes and social morals. At the same time it is a hilarious period comedy. I love the way it portrays the period and the attitudes of small town people about sex in particular. Emily is outstanding in this role. No surprise that she went on to bigger movies. Wonderful role for the late Tom Bell. I treasure my copy.",1350604800,,392,4.695652173913044
209309,5,6300155447,"It is a very touching, poignant story, but it also is full of many scenes that're guaranteed to make to laugh. Emily is a riot. Love her to pieces!",1307577600,,147,4.103448275862069
209310,1,6300155447,"I'll have to admit that I bought this little piece of cheesecake because it was only $3.33 and the good looking British lasse on the cover was showing off some of her handsome flesh. But what I got was the most depressing and sordid life story of a supposed real life English prostitute. The film made an attempt to give a sympathetic late 20th century interpretation of her life. But I saw through it and believe me I didn't sympathize at all! I found the lead character to be the most unpleasant, disfunctional mess of a human being that no one would ever want to encounter. I could only sympathize with her father and a host of her victims whom the film went to pains to discredit. I can believe that women in third world countries are forced into prostitution against their will but in western countries I think it has more to do with a lack of morals, laziness and just really bad judgement. I believe this because I've met too many refugees in the US who came here with shrapnel still floating around in their bodies but still managed to accomplish great things just through willpower and determination.  The woman in this story kind of reminds me of former American madam Heidi Fleiss: kind of weird, kind of strange but mostly just grotesque and sickening.  So much for late century revisionism. I was forced by Amazon's rating system to give at least one star but if I had a choice I wouldn't give it any at all.",1223251200,,1421,4.482625482625482
209311,3,6300155447,"Nice little film, it's never clear exactly why Emily Lloyd turns out so daft. Okay, her mom died young, but the old man doesn't seem like such a bad bloke. It didn't add up for me.

Also this flick points out that under certain conditions a troubled girl will do it with anything on two legs.",1177891200,,292,4.214285714285714
209312,4,6300155447,"This is a gem of a picture that is well worth checking out primarily for the glowing performance of Emily Lloyd as Lynda Mansell, a teenager growing up in Post-war England who defies the staid coventions of her seaside town.  Lynda is a young girl who on the surface cheerfully thumbs her nose at society by her outwardly outrageous behavior while internally nursing emotional wounds.  Credit director-writer David Leland for intricately explaining the rationale for Lynda's behavior.  This film also succeeds in evoking the mood and look of the period.  I remember when this film came out that great things were envisioned for Lloyd.  She appeared in the Bruce Willis film, ""In Country"" and ""Killing Zoe"" but seems to have disappeared.  Here's hoping that she emerges on the scene again because she is immensely talented.",1111795200,3,822,5.051851851851852
209313,5,6300155447,"This film lends courage to girls who sometimes make bad choices. What's wonderful about the ending is that Emily Lloyd's character is still thumbing her nose at the repressed community around her. There's a certain triumph when she declares ""yes it's mine, ALL mine"" about her newborn baby. Instead of choosing to feel ashamed for having a child out of wedlock, she makes the absolute best of the situation. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has a soft spot in their heart for non-conformity.",1090713600,11,501,4.837209302325581
209314,5,6300155447,"Film buffs should rejoice that this outstanding little British gem has finally seen the light of day on DVD. David Leland's 1987 comedy-drama about a headstrong 16-year-old girl's ""coming of age"" in post WW 2 England only played the arthouses upon on its initial run, so remains largely unknown to U.S. audiences. This  movie recalls ""golden age"" British sex comedies like ""Georgy Girl"", ""The Knack"", ""The Family Way"" and ""Alfie"". Vivacious teenager Emily Lloyd makes an astounding, Oscar-worthy debut as pretty but potty-mouthed ""Linda"", whose hormone-fueled manic behavior (...) are causing her somewhat reserved widower father and younger sister to walk around in a perpetual state of public embarrassment. With a taut script and precise performances, the film breezes along on a deft roller coaster of deep belly-laugh hilarity and genuine, bittersweet emotion. Excellent support from the entire cast, especially from the great Thom Bell, who finds a sympathetic humanity in a somewhat vile character that a lesser actor could not likely pull off. The real tragedy here is that Emily Lloyd, who displayed such amazing potential in this debut, never really ""broke big"", appearing in only a few unremarkable projects and then basically dropping off the radar to join that sad ""whatever happened to..."" file. The DVD transfer is excellent, no extras to speak of, but this wonderful film speaks for itself!",1083024000,14,1406,5.304932735426009
209315,5,6300155447,"This movie is about Lynda, a rather delinquent teenage girl growing up after the the Second World War in a bleak and dismal English seaside town. She spends most of the film getting sacked from one job after another and losing her innocence with considerable thoroughness and determination. Working briefly for the local bus company, she eagerly loses her virginity to a rather clumsy young bus conductor who is not slow afterwards to take his custom elsewhere. Somewhat heartbroken, she tries to cheer herself up by throwing herself at Eric, a much older man who has been making advances, with predictably sad results...
Leland has written and realized a masterly script that is sometimes extremely funny and sometimes desperately sad, shifting between these two with enormous sureness of touch. The best thing about it by miles is Emily Lloyd's performance as Lynda, feisty, immensely funny, sometimes appallingly foolish, sometimes downright obnoxious but somehow always completely adorable, which is nothing short of astonishing in its charm and total believability. Perhaps you agree with me that the coming of age movie can sometimes be a pretty tedious genre where one suspects too many writers turn memories of their not very interesting adolescences into not very interesting stories. If so you might be put off seeing this which would be a terrible shame as this utterly fresh and delightful movie is a glorious exception.",1074038400,20,1432,5.203463203463204

7803196,5,6300155447,"I keep checking.... hoping for news of a blu-ray release. But since all remains quiet,
I'll continue my candlelight vigil and add my thoughts....

The script, director and cast are all wonderful, but Emily Lloyd truly glows in this awesome
character study. She plays a lonely, moody, hilariously foul-mouthed girl in 1950's
Britain. It doesn't take long to see past her rebellious hy-jinxs, to the deep pain and
vulnerability that threaten to push her over the edge.

This is a lovely movie about fighting through the pain of the bad times and cherishing
the unique flame inside ourselves.... (especially when no one else does.)
Beautiful film-making.  .....Highly Recommended.",1462924800,,677,5.25

7803199,2,6300155447,"Emily Lloyd did a great job of convincing me that she was Lynda. What I really never fully understood is why Lynda was Lynda. What was she really rebelling against, and if she was trying to prove something to herself and/or everyone else; why? This feels like a film that is missing crucial scenes, and throughout my viewing I kept expecting something, anything, that would underpin Lynda's desperate and self-destructive behaviour. While I did find the ending to be somewhat redeeming of Lynda's character, there just simply isn't enough plot or character development to push me over the hump to liking this film. Sadly, 2.5 stars.",1407715200,3,632,4.971698113207547
