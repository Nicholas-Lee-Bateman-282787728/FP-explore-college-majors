5160764,5,B008GY8R98,"[ Updated after attending San Francisco Opera's November 21, 2015 production staged by McVicar) When I read a grossly over-praised review, I chuckled. This blu-ray is a good buy with caveats - if you can forgive the adequateness of Hans Sachs' voice quality and the poor singing of Von stolzing which I did for other good reasons. The production is very beautifully done in a traditional staging updatd from the original 16th century to 1813. Gerald Finley is a lyric baritone whose career spinned around Mozart's operas. He demonstrates intelligent singing, but his voice lacks depth and volume and his voice is not dark enough to be a persuasive Sachs. I also noticed that he tried too hard to be an intelligent Sachs at times becoming self-conscious for his phrasing. At times, he sounded like singing Mozart concert arias instead of a live opera. The other drawback is the he looked a bit too young to be Hans Sachs on stage as he looked like almost the same age as Eva. This can be a visual problem to depict Hans' internal conflict on his age in Scene 4 of Act 3 when he compared himself to King Marke of Tristan und Isolde as an old man trying to marry a much younger woman. There is a similar problem for Rene Pape being too young for Pogner in the Met production to a lesser extent. Some make-overs were really needed for him in that production.

Marco Jentzsch struggled through some parts of his Von Stolzing and the audience did not give him a full round of applause. He knew that based on the expressions on his face. He sings only adequately and his high register is thin and sloppy. So, even though he is way below the best standard set forth by Heppner(Met Production) and Botha (Vienna Production), His prize song in the final act faltered so much that you just wonder how he could get this opera career this far. But overall, he gets by only because there are many other good leads in this opera. In a nutshell, he looks good, but sounds only adequately.

Vladimir conducted a sensitive and light weighted Meistersinger with clarity in the textures of the music which is not a bad thing. But since Glyndebourne is a very small venue being more suitable for Mozart operas than heavy Wagner, its sound world can be underwhelming at times. It can work for Tristan, but I expect a little more from Die Meistersinger.

Verdict: Sight & Sound: 5 stars
Two leads: 3 stars depending on where they are in different acts, Eva is simply bland.
Conducting: 4 stars (I need to hear some more zips in certain parts. Wagner is not Debussy. Sometimes, it needs to go beyond the mere demonstration of clarity. Yes, it is not the Ring Cycle, but it still needs to be Wagner by its own nature. The pace is steady, but too even-paced at times wanting more passions.)
The rest of leads: 3 - 4 stars
Chorus: 4 stars
Production & Stage Directing: 5 star

Overall Value: 4.9 Stars

My recommendation? If you are new to Meistersinger looking for good production, acceptable singing of two leads AND fabulous SIGHT & SOUND quality in HD. Then it is a very good BUY.

But if you are looking for superior leads of Pogner, Sachs and Von Stolzing, but willing to settle for DTS 5.1 sound on DVD, then I would say you can consider buying the following first:

1) Met Production (Heppner/Mattila/Pape/Levine)
2) Berlin Production (Brendel/Winbergh/Johansson/Fruhbeck de Burgos)
3) Vienna Production (Struckermann/Merbeth/Botha/Thielemann)

All of those productions are in 16:9 ratio and available at Amazon.com",1351987200,42,3496,4.710310965630114
5160765,5,B008GY8R98,"It's tempting to make a snap judgement about a production of a Wagner opera right from the first note, and it's surprising just how accurate that judgement can often turn out to be.  I'd suggest that you can get a feel for the tone of the whole 2011 Glyndebourne production of Die Meistersinger von Nrnburg just from Vladimir Jurowski's conducting of the London Philharmonic Orchestra through the opera's beautiful overture.  Being Wagner, everything is there upfront in the Vorspiel to Act I, and in such a work with its richness of meaning and infinite ways of interpretation, you could aim for an approach that is respectful and serious, emphatic and declamatory, sensitive and romantic, even playful and irreverent and you would still be touching on vital ingredients that are all part of the make-up of Die Meistersinger von Nrnburg.  You might well pick up elements of those qualities in this Glyndebourne production - and by rights they should all be in there - but from the very first note my overriding impression was that there was a particularly English touch to the delivery that emphasises the qualities in this remarkable work that one doesn't find so readily in the composer's other grand music dramas - a lightness, a warmth, a sense of humour and an air of melancholy, the tug of deep human emotions bound up in something great and beautiful.

This is a light, delicate and sensitive treatment of a beautifully balanced, thoughtful and considered work then, a far cry from the most recent Bayreuth production.  I don't always like the odd touches that David McVicar adds to his productions and I often find him weak on a cohesive concept, but I can rarely fault him on his ability to hit on the perfect mood and find the most effective way of expressing it through the performers and in their relationship with all the other aspects of the production and musical performance.  His work for this Glyndebourne production of Die Meistersinger von Nrnburg is just about flawless.  It's perhaps a little unadventurous - setting the work within the years of Wagner's apprenticeship around 1820 rather than the original 16th century setting - but his handling of the diverse moods and rhythms of the work is masterful throughout, taking in the wide range of emotions and tones that has Hans Sachs at its heart, from melancholy to slapstick, without ever missing a beat or hitting an incongruous note that isn't suggested by the score.

Everything about the production respects this, having a cohesiveness in the period design, in the enclosed sacred locations - the church as much as the craftsman's workshop or the community square - in the lighting, in the little touches of humour and irreverence.  There's also a recognition that everything important that needs to be expressed is there in the music itself, within the very structure of Wagner's composition which is the very definition of his views on the strength and power of the music-drama, the two aspects conjoined and inseparable, each supporting the other to create a rhythm and balance between the surface drama and the inner nature, with all the contradictions and complexity that this implies.  It's enough to give the work room to breathe and allow the performers of the music and the singing to consider the detail, interpret it and express it through their individual strengths of personality.  There's never a moment where you are waiting to get to the next more interesting scene, every moment has its own magic and Jurowski and McVicar give the singers all the opportunity they need to luxuriate in the beauty and the rich wonder of Wagner's incredible score, revealing it in all its majestic glory.

Gerald Finley's performance of Hans Sachs is the best example of this.  Never have I ever seen Finley look so at home in a role, his lovely baritone sounding warm, rounded and unforced, not over-expressive, but arising naturally out of consideration for his character, rolling around the beauty and the very sound of the words, taking the time to consider their meaning and luxuriate in their phrasing.  But it's far from the only impressive singing performance, the clear lyrical lightness of Marco Jentzsch's Walther and Topi Lehpituu's David both perfect foils for Anna Gabler's emotional Eva and Michaela Selinger's Lena.  If their singing could be considered to lack traditional Wagnerian force, the work gains from their youthful sincerity of feeling.  On the other side of the coin, but perfectly complementary, Alastair Miles displays a studious good natured gravity and solemnity as Pogner with a tone that is as beautiful as it is expressive.  You could listen to this for hours.  Beckmesser's comic value is easy to overplay and demonise and the role consequently has a tendency to be underrated in comparison to the earnestness of the other characters, but he's no less a vital component to the overall structure and tone and Johannes Martin Krnzle brings colour and personality to the role, with lots of comic grimacing, slapstick and double-takes, all of which fit in perfectly with the tone presented here.

This is as memorable as Meistersinger as any you'll find, one that capitalises on the intimacy of the Glyndebourne theatre and finds an appropriate tone in the performance, the staging and the singing to delve more deeply into the particular human qualities that are unique to this Wagner music-drama, expressing everything that is great about this work on levels I've never considered before.  The Glyndebourne effect and the challenges of staging Wagner there is explored in the concise extra features, in interviews with Jurowski, McVicar and Finley, with particular consideration on the approach taken for this work.  The Glyndebourne relationship with Wagner is also covered in the accompanying booklet, which also contains a full synopsis.  The quality of the Opus Arte Blu-ray production is exemplary in every respect, from the screen direction by Franois Roussillon, to the well-lit High Definition image and the lovely detail revealed in the HD audio mixes.  The 2-disc BD is of course compatible for all regions, but includes only English, French and German subtitles.",1350000000,55,6184,5.047105004906771
5160766,5,B008GY8R98,I am a huge fan of Der Meistersinger.  This recording joins several others I have.  It is enjoyable in every respect.,1413849600,,117,4.523809523809524
5160767,4,B008GY8R98,"This is a 'light-weight' production musically, with a slight dramatic twist in the handling of the script.
My reaction to this highly entertaining performance is more favourable musically than dramatically, with just one or two slight reservations.
It is pointless to argue on the work's hidden political agenda, for without all such, the work is still a highly cogent masterpiece of  German opera.
The stage direction is very British - the apprentices being vivacious and 'rude' at the same time, headed by Topi Lehtipuu's David, who put up virtually the best solo performance in this recording.  Lehtipuu not only sings well, but his singing has much vitality and strong personality, a real apprentice to Sachs.
Gerald Finley's Hans Sachs, on the other hand, is much more reserved.  It is more intellectual than iconic, being very British in his dramatic portrayal and very lyrical in his vocal portrayal, so much so that this Meistersinger has a 'twist' in its central character. Hence, the final Act and Scene's of Sach's 'preaching' appears a bit odd when an almost home-like Sachs delivers to the towsfolk 'Heilige Deutsche Kunst'.  In any event, this production is Meistersinger with a twist.
That makes Sixtus Beckmesser a more 'elegant' figure than he would have been in other more traditional productions.  Johannes Martin Kranzle is an elegant Beckmesser, not a complete laughing stock but just a figure of irony.
The least successful main protagonist is Walther von Stoltzing. Portraying the 'meistersinger' is young tenor Marco Jentzsch, who have a tall figure, almost towering, over his partners like Finley's Sachs, Kranzle's Beckmesser and Gabler's Eva. I don't know how young is this singer, but among the younger crops of 'heldentenors', I would have thought that the Croatian Tomislav Muzek would have been a better fit vocally than Jentzsch, who's top register sounds a bit narrow and forced most, if not all, of the time.
Anna Gabler's Eva is not much better than Jentzsch vocally, either.  The voice lacks a certain shimmer.
The biggest applause goes to the conductor Jurowski, who demonstrates that he really knows the score inside out to give successful musical backup for this 'twist' of a production - different threads of the score well-defined, with the various contrapuntal parts welded vividly and harmoniously, never congested. His control over the chorus is similarly exemplary, even in the meadow scene featuring voices with contrsting themes.
This should not be the only Meistersinger DVD to own, but it would certainly be a very entertaining addition to every opera lover's shelf.",1393459200,,2615,5.199524940617577
5160768,4,B008GY8R98,"I second the reviewer who took exception to the portrayals of Jentzsch and Finley as von Stolzing and Sachs.
Evidently this is one of the smallest venue for operas, so we can NEVER demand large voiced a Walther or Hans.  Even so, these pivotal characters have loads and loads to sing in a long opera such as Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg, and miscasting can cause real detriment to the show.
In the present case the harm is minimised by wonderful staging of McVicars and highly competent conducting of Vladimir Jurowski.
As for the singers, Jentzsch's voice is not plangent, but that is not the only point - it lacks the quality to convince that this is the von Stolzing that ultimately out-sings all others!  The tone is grainly and the sound unfocused.  This has nothing to do with the size of the timbre. His acting is, to put it very mildly, fundamental.
As for Finley's Hans Sachs, it is quite another story - of inadequacy.
Don't get me wrong, for I know that this baritone has attained a demi-god status in Britain, so casting him as Sachs was a logical result of a logical sequence of selection.  Yet, the result is that we have a musically competent, stylish singer who sings 'himself' and not Sachs.  As Mr. Wang has said, this Sachs lacks the requisite gravity of voice, resulting in inadequate musical weight to the vocal portrayal, some thing which is not one jot assisted by Mr. Finley's stage presence, alas.  The result is we see and hear a Figaro from Mozart's Le Nozze feigning Hans Sachs, Wagner's buffo 'hero' - if you but have a little grasp of the libretto you'd know that Sachs has to be a hero!
Otherwise, I find the performance of very high standard, and the acting and stage direction particularly outstanding.
Despite those rather 'major' flaws, still four stars no less.",1393372800,,1799,4.659305993690852
5160769,5,B008GY8R98,"I could go into detail about some of the minor issues I had with this production but I'd fear my review coming across as discordant with just how overwhelmed I was with how it very much worked. Sure, Jentzsch's voice struck me as struggling at times. And while quite beautiful, the setting in the early 19th century was a bit anachronistic with some of the text which, in the finale for example, firmly places the opera centuries earlier. But these are minor quibbles when I think about the effect this production, taken as a whole, had on me. There was exquisite attention to detail, gorgeous sets, a real tenderness and sensitivity to the themes of love and art, a decidedly good sense of humor when it was appropriate to the text, solid playing from the pit, and several great voices and acting in the cast. By the finale, I was close to tears (good opera has that effect on me) and look forward to coming back to this Blu-Ray again and again.",1385510400,3,946,4.505813953488372

Whether it is a trick of the camera or not, I think that this production comes off beautifully.  Good voices, handsome actors, good staging.  I'm biased toward Wagner.  I go to bed never knowing whether it will be Mozart, Bellini, Verdi, Wagner or Strauss who has composed the soundtrack to my dreams that night -- even Gluck shows his seductive head now and then -- but they are Bellini and Wagner whose music will accompany me to the grave.

5160774,5,B008GY8R98,"OK, let me pause this; David is telling Walther that getting to be a Mastersinger isn't as easy as he might think...

As you might know, if you know this work moderately well, I'm only a few minutes into it, but I can tell you a few important bits of information that might help.

The casting is actually good, given that I haven't seen either Pogner or Hans Sachs yet, (though I know Gerald Finley from Figaro, and I would imagine he is the wrong sort for the job.  But I've seen James Morris doing Hans Sachs, and though, on the face of it, I might have thought he would be a good choice, he was too insensitive, too untroubled, and not, in the end, the perfect Sachs.  But he did a workmanlike job, and did not detract from the wonderful job of Karita Mattila, Rene Pape, Ben Heppner, and the young fellow who played David, and the lady who played Magdalena, who were all brilliant.)  Walther looks perfect: a young chap in his late twenties (apparently), and so is David, a tall, gangly young man with a very mobile face, and a fantastic actor with his body.  (Comedy is so much about physical comedy; without it, the sentimentality gets overwhelming.  The sentimentality is going to be painful anyway, I fear.)  Eva and Lena are fine, though Eva looks just a bit older than the 19-something she's supposed to be!  But the actress has a youthful manner that is going to make it all right.  Lena is a superb, restrained comedienne.  (If the members of the guild are terrible, I will edit this and let you know.  I'm expecting them to be at least OK.)

The sets, so far, (just in the church) are really nice: light and airy, and sort of English in a Roman Catholic sort of way!  The colors are nice, late Renaissance colors, and suit the actors well.

The Costumes are a cross between the clothes of Wagner's time, and the clothes of Hans Sach's time.  Somehow, because Wagner wrote so much in the idiom of his own day (however hard he tried to evoke the style of the big sagas), this is going to work better than if they had used more period clothing.  I'm not an expert, but they seem to be 18th century clothes with just a little more stylistic detail to come across nice and rich in the Blu-Ray disc.

The sound quality is adequate.  My system is well able to deliver exceptional sound, but here I'm getting only C+ grade sound.  Something is wrong with either the miking, or the sound transfer.  Not wrong, just not quite competent.  This is inexcusable in this age of small, compact microphones that are really wonderful.  But I'm turning down the sound in the loud parts, and turning it up for the dialog(ue).

The orchestra is good, and is responsive, though they only watch the conductor out of the corner of their eye.  This is a British thing, where they pretend to ignore the conductor!

For those who have never watched Meistersinger, and don't know what it is about: this is Wagner's last, and longest single opera.  It is considered by some to be his best.  The writing is brilliant, and more subtle than in the Ring, for example, the large work he wrote in the middle of his life, and which (unfortunately) is considered to be representative of his writing.  Wagner is often heavy-handed, but here he displays more deftness than we would have come to expect from studying his earlier works.

Summary: not a bad purchase at all.  The youthfulness of the cast is a definite plus.  Again, I'm not an expert, but I think the movie direction is very good.  The daylight is bright (much brighter than in the MET production), and the acting more modern, and less ""heroic"".  Highly recommended, but perhaps I'm too ravished by the Blu-Ray medium.

[Added later] I have watched for another half hour, and I want to add: (1) The Mastersinger's Guild is great; well cast, and well acted.  Walther is very believable as the young knight who wants to abandon his country home, and live in the City.  (Nuremberg was one of the earliest Free Cities in Germany, and in the World.) Veit Pogner as the generous Patron of the Arts and generally enlightened philanthropist is great, Beckmesser is merely OK, but I hate villains, so I never rate them highly, sorry!.  (3) The music is a lot less terrible than I reported earlier.  I keep wanting a more perfect sound, but the audio is just clear, but not spectacular.  (4) I miss the awesome set that we had in the MET production.  This one is fine for what it does.  I will have more to report after the Riot.  (Yes, there is a riot, which is a centerpiece of the comedy.  Its choreography is usually a tour de force of the choreographer's art.  It was wonderful in the MET production, with James Levine et al.)

(4) Eva is not a great beauty, but she does well.  Her voice is at least good, and she performs her role with sympathy and enthusiasm.

(4) Gerald Finley is not bad.  He is a lot older than I remember seeing him, and looks a lot more a man of action than an intellectual, which latter is what he is renowned as.  So far, David the Apprentice is stealing the show!  All very enjoyable.

5160775,5,B008GY8R98,"This is a terrific recording of a wonderful stage performance at Glyndebourne of Wagner's most accessible opera.  Many highlights here, which I will delineate.

Let's start with David McVicar's staging.  The stage at Glyndebourne is fairly small (in comparison to Covent Garde, the Met, etc), which creates a unique challenge for this large work.  It is large in that there is a very large chorus, and many ""meistersingers"" who need to be on stage at the same time. No problem. McVicar scales it down to the proper dimensions of his stage (including going ""up"" with some dancers at a second level in the carnival final scene), making it very effective, if not quite intimate.  The stage movements flowed very well, and it was all very well done.  I emphasize this because last year (January 2012), I saw his previous staging of this opera at Covent Garden, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much.  So here, smaller was much better.

I thought Gerald Finley was superb as Hans Sachs.  He is a little young (especially in comparison to Eva- and maybe he should have had a little ""grey"" in his hair), but there certainly are young widowers.  His whole demeanor in the show was warm, a man of the people, which is what he is.  Marvelous singing (I don't need or like extra-declamatory Wagner singers), effective acting.  He was the highlight for me.

As was the chorus.  Their riot scene at the close of Act 2, and the final scene with the meistersinging contest was great fun.  Lot's of little stuff to watch as each performer does a separate personal thing.

Finally, the dvd itself was excellent- video, sound, subtitles, etc.  The two dvd extras (""An opera with baggage"" and ""Meistersinger von Glyndebourne"" were interesting and well worth watching.

This dvd is a winner, and preferred to the Met's, though that one is also very good.",1364342400,2,1833,4.746835443037975

5160777,5,B008GY8R98,"This Bluray offering may signal a new level of opera accessibility. Thanks to advances in cinematography, this disc brings a visual richness and immediacy to the audience that is simply unavailable in person. How important is that? It depends on your theories of opera in general and Wagner in particular. Some reviews here have complained that this performance lacks the robust musicality some associate with Wagner. But Wagner himself might disagree. Wagner was the champion, if not the epitome, of opera as a multi-media enterprise. That does not always privilege the bombastic orchestra and the floor-rumbling, ear-splitting voices. The Bayreuth was actually designed to mute the orchestra by reflecting the sound off the stage. As critic Bryan Magee insists, absolute musical purity is misapplied to Wagner: ""Wagner singing needs to be dramatic and musical in equal proportions, and the best Wagner singers are not necessarily those who produce the loveliest sounds...It is great performances that constitute Wagner singing at its best, and this involves powers of vocal characterization and acting, gifts of psychological and dramatic insight, as well as beautiful singing..."" In this spirit, this production takes visual and dramatic detail to level unavailable to the back, or perhaps even the middle, of the theater. There is a richness of detail in color, lighting, and visual production that only a camera could capture.

The same sort of accommodations to drama appear to have been applied to casting. In an opera about meistersingers, one might expect muscular voices, in which case it might seem a let-down that the young lovers show the lightness of lyric voices. But that mistakes the title for the plot. The lighter voices fit their roles dramatically. The greatest risk on this point is casting a lyric tenor for the role of von Stolzing. He has to fill the role of the triumphant hero in the singing contest. Shouldn't his voice be extraordinarily robust? For a Hollywood musical, yes; for Wagner's plot, no. Recall: von Stolzing has NO singing experience. Recall: von Stolzing compensates for his lack of singing knowledge not by vocal finesse or by memorizing the singer's codes, but by writing great love poetry, which is what triumphs in the end. Sachs' final speech about music is not about voices, but about craft and culture. Indeed, Hans Sachs is the real hero of the opera, and a lighter von Stolzing throws him into relief. The emphasis on Sachs becomes clear in the third act, which begins with a dramatic shift in tone as the focus shifts to Sachs. The use of lighting and visual detail made gorgeous by Bluray elevates the inner gravity of the plot in a way that was not evident in the first two acts, and with a level of subtlety and detail of expression that would hardly be accessible to an audience without close-ups. When the act opens in his studio, we are treated to a sustained meditation on his inner world, even before the singing begins. In that setting, less supernatural sounding voices seem appropriate. I would have been disappointed by the horned-helmet approach to the younger roles, which are powerfully acted here as well as earnestly sung.

Because of its multidimensional character, opera can please and disappoint in as many ways. Old school Wagner requiring huge voices of mythic stature will still have its place, but the humanism of Die Meistersinger allows for a more down-to-earth emphasis on the drama. I'm guessing that the virtues achieved by this fine production foreshadow new possibilities for Wagner and his audiences.",1362182400,11,3584,5.083191850594227
5160778,4,B008GY8R98,"Die Meistersinger is usually one of the grandest of grand operas, but her you get a small scale version with an outstanding lead-Gerald Finley is simply wonderful in creating a Hans Sachs who is younger than most but more moving than most.
Vladimir Jurowski's conducting of the London Philharmonic Orchestra is wonderful.
Glyndebourne is a venue that is small for this opera, but David McVicar creates a production that brings has singers to the forefront and creates wonderfully real characters- he's made a virtue of a handicap.
Some will miss the huge chorus and the pomp of Meistersinger's contest, but the humanity of this production (especially of Gerald Finley's Hans Sachs) makes this a more moving experience than usual.

5160779,3,B008GY8R98,"Lured in by good reviews and the prospect of Blu-ray sound and video, I went for this. This title should be $10 as the audio is mixed oddly and the music is not well executed. I knew I was in trouble upon hearing the overture both sloppy and even slightly out of tune at times. I understand that orchestral musicians play this overture every other concert and perhaps can get stale on it... well that sure shows here as this orchestra barely sleepwalks though the overture and the maestro does nothing to fix any of it (including some intonation). Lead roles are equally suspect in both casting and execution. Perhaps I am expecting too much from a production that may include some ringers and is not a close-knit ""house"" of musicians who often perform opera together. But then again... why the kicked up price point?

The 4-5 star reviews here are clearly not too focused on the music part of Wagner's Total Art Work and more on the staging and visuals and Blu-ray. Just because is it is in HD does not make it an automatic must have. The sound isn't mixed all that well anyways. As some others have stated here... this production could not tie the shoes of some of the classic ""low def"" versions. Save your money and find one of those.",1357516800,5,1237,4.497777777777777
5160780,5,B008GY8R98,"The man, I mean, as I conceive him from historical and literary sources. I dislike his grasping amoral narcissism. I despise his Romantic nationalism; however you slice it, he wasn't the Kulturgott of Nazism without reason. I detest nearly every word of his librettos ... and that's a lot of words to loathe in either German or English! I've heard every one of his operas, many of them live, several more than once, and I've seldom not been bored to tears, especially in the usual turgid Heldenbellow performances. I've never seen anything, fleshly or mechanical, move as slowly as the typical Siegfried or Isolde on stage. Even my appreciation for his music per se, his gorgeous orchestral colors, is qualified by a sense that the man tolerated his own bombast too easily.

Good. Now I've got that off my chest and I can say that this film of the Glyndebourne ""Mastersingers of Nurenberg"" is spectacular. Whaddya know! Wagner can be entertainment! The staging is extravagant, the costumes are opulent, there are jugglers and drunks and boisterous kids on stage, the camera-work is Oscar quality, and the Acting is vivid! Nobody stands or staggers in Bayreuthish stupor. On a DVD, it does indeed matter that the singers ""look"" right in their roles. This entire cast looks right, not too old or young, not too porcine or lupine, just right. And thus I can concentrate on their voices without the distraction of cognitive dissonance. It's the four chief male singers who NEED to look plausible and act plausibly. Topi Letipuu as David and Johannes Krnzle as Beckmesser are gleesomely comic, and Letipuu can SING! Marco Jentzsch is thoroughly convincing as the holy innocent Walter von Stolzing, a staple figure in German literature from Tannhser to Simplicius. Other reviewers have found fault with Jentzsch's vocal technique; he doesn't whoop heroically enough for their taste. I couldn't disagree more; it's a delight to my ears to hear lighter, more focused voices like Jentzsch's and Anna Gabler's (Eva) sing this music, especially in the dense and awkward counterpoint of the ensembles. Gerald Finley, to my eyes, didn't look like Hans Sachs when he first appeared on stage, not until I fathomed his dramatic conception of the role.

""The Mastersingers"" is a love story with a happy ending, but that's the lesser portion of the drama. It's above all a portrayal of the ""mid-life"" crisis of artistic consciousness of the poet-cobbler Hans Sachs. Sachs needs to be a tormented, bifurcated figure in order for his altruism to be heroic. Finley acts the role brilliantly and reserves his most masterful singing for his final arias, when he has overcome his own doubts and regrets. Die Meistersinger is ""Wagner with a human face"" -- i.e. with a cast of Humans rather than comic-book superheroes and Gawds. The drama of this tale is human, humane, humanistic. One can care about such characters.

Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg is, of course, the perennial favorite Wagner opera among Wagner haters like me. There are still things about it that I reject. It's two hundred eighty minutes long! If you don't agree that ""less might be more"" perhaps you can accept the possibility that ""less might be just as much."" The dramatic animation and visual splendor of this production were necessary to carry my attention through the musically turgid scenes in which the aesthetics of ""mastersinging"" were expounded.

More troublesome: the conclusion of the opera -- Hans Sach's impassioned defense of the Mastersingers against Walther's aristocratic scorn for them -- is an odious paean to the Sacred Purity of German Art. It's xenophobic Nazionalismus ennobled by orchestration. Protect the ""Holy Roman Empire"" from corruption by Un-Germans??? Come on, Hans! From your Holy Roman Empire to the Thousand Year Reich is such a short time-journey! My non-German wife, who had needed considerable persuasion to sit with me through a Wagner opera, was aghast, and rightly so.

Conductor Vladimir Jurowski deserves some attention here, for his energetic tempi and his earnest efforts to coax articulations and shapely phrases from the legato-stricken strings of the London Philharmonic. What more could he have done short of clipping their bows a foot shorter? Jurowski looks like a Gogol impersonation of Riccardo Muti and wields his baton with comparable grace. Diehard Heldenwallow Wagnerites will no doubt complain that Jurowski's interpretation is too restrained, along with Jentzch's voice and Finley's thespianism. Oh well.

5160781,5,B008GY8R98,"Finally we have a DVD of a decently-staged MEISTERSINGER without the idiotic posturings to which we've been subjected over the past decades of Eurotrash stagings. On that point alone, it's recommendable. Some reviewers thought Finley's voice too light for Sachs. I thought he's the best baritone Sachs since Thomas Stewart (the finest Sachs of the stereo era regrettably not caught on video). He's alive to the text and manages Wagner's vocal demands without shouting. He's worlds better than James Morris who can't sing and posturing is called acting. In addition, the Walter, Marco Jentzsch, would have been better cast as David. Sandor Konya also was a light Walter but his voice had more depth and penetration than Jentzsch as well as a beautiful tone. Finally, Jurowski is a much better conductor than on any of the competition (especially Levine's travesty).

As another review pointed out, the sound is on the weak side. It has to be turned up quite a bit to get any richness.

Certainly not a perfect MEISTERSINGER but one whose pluses ouweigh the minuses.",1356912000,3,1064,5.005649717514125
5160782,5,B008GY8R98,"I am an old Meistersinger hand, having seen it several times on stage, having multiple cd recordings, and a handful of videos.  This Glyndebourne production is a treasure which will continue to give pleasure in many ways upon repeated viewings.

The space upon which it is performed we know to be small, so much depends on ingenuity than on phalanxes of choristers, dancers, and, at the conclusion of act II, huge amount of feather pillows being thrown about.  David MacVicar creates miracle out of necessity by projecting intimacy and immediacy as well as a sense of community with less than huge forces without ever shortchanging music or drama. His staging, transferred to the 1840's, works perfectly well and invests every character on stage with a life of their own, and relate to each other as good neighbours of little Nuremberg would have done; one senses each could tell their own life-stories given the chance and the music.  And they all seem to be an amiable lot. Even when the stage is people exclusively by a principal or two, there is a sense of good-will emating from even books on a shelf that projects easily in the cozy confines of this East Sussex paradise.

Vladimir Jurowski conducts a lively, tender performance, full of color and tender detail.  My personal bias is for proceedings to virtually stop when we come to the quintet in the third act and allow each character to sing out their noble and beautiful emotions at a pace that I would call ""magical"" and is not necessarily tied to whatever pulse and tempo the opera has been moving at, it is a moment of heightened repose in which Wagner's music including that beautiful soaring violin line is allowed to shine in what must be for me the loveliest ensemble in all of opera.  Jurowski integrated the quintet more into the fabric of his overall musical enterprise, whereas I would have suspended disbelief, so to say, and indulged. Jurowski did well by Wagner.  One could not tell that the LPO was slightly reduced (80) to fit in the pit.  It provided beautiful, very clear playing of one of Wagner's most complex scores; indeed all lines of music were easily discernible, even to me following without a score.

The singing emphasized the lyrical aspects of the piece (let us not forget Birgit Nilsson's appearance at Glyndebourne was in Mozart: Electra in Idomeneo). All the Masters were excellently delineated and sung, particularly the Pogner of Alastair Miles with his resounding deep bass in top form.  Beckmesser, whom I have seen in multiplicity of ways but who can easily lapse into charicature or worse, was marvelously acted and sung by Martin Krnzle.... his tears and stage business as Walther's song made evident its superiority not only to others, but to him also, were memorable; Sixtus Beckmesser is no fool. Whatever else he may be, even bitter and genuinely conservative, he is nonetheless informed and musically sensitive.  He may prize Pogner's gold, but he can tell the obvious superiority of Walther's song.  But in this extremely coherent ensemble of singers and actors, Gerald Finley shines.  Everything Mr. Finley does, even when alone in his cobbler's shop justifies the homage of his own Wacht Auf! spontaneously taken up by the townspeople upon his appearance on the meadow.  It is a moment of genuine surprise for him and great love and emotion for all on stage (and us in the audience). Mr. Finlay's voice rides the music beautifully and with scrupulous musicianship.  His experience in lieder shows, as words are so keenly felt and inflected while the voice never loses its very personal beauty. Mr. Finley's Hans Sachs is a youngish widower, perhaps in his early forties, still very much a romantic, even if wise and philosophical about the twists and turns life can take: no King Marke future for him. Eva is undoubtedly in love with Walther von Stolzing, but nonetheless she realizes the special happiness that could have been shared with Sachs.  One of the singular beauties of Meistersinger is that by the opera's end, everybody is a little bit wiser. For me, Topi Lehpituu is the finest David I have ever seen. David is a difficult part with much to sing (are there enough notes for two Nemorinos?).  It requires a beautiful lyric voice and a youthful, agile stage presence, capable of great physicality.  Mr. Lehpituu, expert in Mozart and the baroque, succeeds here on all counts.  He is a most believable, delightful apprentice on his way to journeyman.  Eva is Ana Gabler, in the tradition of the lovely, light lyrical Evas.  She is lovely to look at and sings quite well, even if with a voice that could have difficulty in larger spaces (e.g. the Met).  Walter von Stolzing is always such a problematic role to cast, particularly in a production so carefully scaled and intimate as this one that is to bear the imprint of Glyndebourne: Walther must fit.  Walther must be young, handsome and be able to sing some ardous music which in addition to beautiful legato requires stamina and some degree of power. Marco Jentzch meets some of these requirements but unfortunately is let down by his instrument. What he has, he uses wisely, indeed generously, always aptly and lyrically, but the strength isn't there and will likely never be. Nonetheless, he is so well integrated into the ensemble that even as one realizes his vocal shortcomings (which never result in disaster or surprise horribly) one appreciates his very honest and earnest contribution. Who else could sing this part and still blend in this production?  one would be hard pressed..... Mr. Botha may be splendid in Vienna, but with his powerful instrument, age and broad physique, he would totally have been out of place here.  For Meistersinger is perhaps Wagner's most ensemble-opera, and Mr. McVicar and Vladimir Jurowski have given us a delight in which every piece fits perfectly well so as to leave us with the enchantment we feel at its conclusion.  Indeed, there is regret that the hours went by so quickly. Regardless what other Meistersinger performances on dvd/blu-ray or cd you may have, I recommend this one wholeheartedly.  It will give you much pleasure.",1356652800,16,6149,4.892204042348412
5160783,3,B008GY8R98,"I have over 150 opera and ballet DVD/BRs that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.

This performance comes on 2 blu-rays. Opus Arte is commended for not skimping on the megabits as this is over 3 hours long. Picture is very good, with good illumination most of the time.

Audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 or stereo, which I didn't listen to. Audio engineer is Andy Rose, who is one of my favorite sound engineers. Unfortunately, this is not one of his ""masterworks"".
To start with, it needs a higher loudness setting than I normally use. The recording somehow seems soft or under-recorded. If not loud enough, the voices seem a bit too low relative to the orchestra. Once I arrived at -2db (my normal setting is more around the -12db) the sound stage is very wide as is usual with Andy Rose and the voices are loud and clear. At that setting, most of the singing and orchestra is at a loudness level of 70-80 db, with the occasional short peak at 90db. If I reduce it to 85 db at the loudest orchestra level, than the voices are too soft.
Second, the orchestra itself is not as detailed, as it is in his other recordings. Maybe the orchestra pit was so full of musicians that there was no room for enough microphones, hard to tell. Furthermore, the instruments are somewhat unusually configured. The celli are normally in the center and to the right, while here they are to the left when viewed from the audience. In the middle seems to be 2 harps, which are normally at the side. To the right are all the violas, where you would expect the celli and the double basses. Overall, the result is that most orchestra sound is coming from the left and very little from the right.
Finally, although the voices are very clear, they come only through the center, no movement when the singers are moving. Chorus is recorded well and nicely spread out.

For comparison, I loaded the Glyndebourne's Cosi fan Tutte, which is also recorded by Andy Rose.
Orchestra is beautifully laid out, soundstage 160 degrees, voices cristal clear and move with the singers, perfect balance with the orchestra. That's a ""Meisterwerk"".

So I can give this only an average rating from the audio perspective.

As for the performance, I didn't find much fault. It certainly is very well acted, sung and directed, although Hans Sachs seemed sometimes a bit too moody or melancholy for my liking. I did not find the voice of Marco Jentzsch (von Stolzing) lacking, as others have mentioned. I thought, he has a nice bright voice. As far as the applause at the end, he came after Kraenzle (Beckmesser), who did an outstanding acting job and before Finley, who also got huge applause. So between the two, he had less applause, but to me it seemed comparable to all the other principals.",1355184000,9,3048,4.534545454545454
5160784,4,B008GY8R98,"This most recent Meistersinger, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski anf directed by David McVicker emanates from the Glyndebourne festival of 2011. While the dimensions of the house have been enlarged they still cannot match most of the major opera housses in Europe, but at lest they are now able to fulfill one of the founders of the festival, John Christie, most ardent desires:  the mounting of Wagner's operas. In the early aughts Tristan was presented and now we have Wagner's only comedy. Overall I would say that it is mostly a very successful investiture; however there are some reservations and they cannot be overlooked.

Of the singers the performance of Finley's Hans Sachs' is the most successful. His experience as a lieder singer is clearly evident in the two great monologues as the text is given its due. The voice is a beautiful one. But Finley is just as good an actor as he is a singer. Given his youthful appearance this is no avuncular Sachs; indeed it would not be out of place to imagine that he could be a suitor for Eva. Almost matching him in artistry is Johannes Martin Kranzle as Beckmesser. This is a performance that can stand next to Herman Prey and Thomas Allen, vocally and dramatically. The three remaining leading singers are not in the same league and one can be described as vocally undernourshed. David is sung by Topi Lehtipuu. His Fernando in the Glyndebourne Cosi is wonderful as is his most  recent Tom Rakewell. The voice is not large and he is not faced with heavy orchestration; he lacks the ""metal"" in his voice that Gerhard Unger had and which carried him through countless performances of David. Eva is sung by Anna Gabler who is very much a lyric soprano. A great deal of the time her vocal line is conversational and it is only in the third act is she called upon  to deliver a bigger sound than is hers to offer. ""O Sachs mein Freund"" calls for a spinto sound with passion and the orchestra is accordingly delivering volumn that nearly succeeds in covering her voice. No, the only really weak voice is the tenor, Marco Jentsch, for whom Tamino might even be a stretch. That he looks the role (an invidious comparison could be made with Johan Botha in the Vienna State Opera taping) is almost beside the point. So much of von Stolzing's music simply requires a more heroic sound. This first act ""Am stillen Herd"" is feeble; it is ardent passionate music that requires a more heroic sound--certainly not a Siegfried tenor but the likes of a Sandor Konya for example. And of course the third act both scenes are weakened. I have no idea how the voice sounded in the house; on disc the orchestra is not unleashed so that he is never swamped by the usual Wagner sound. If only Kaus Florian Vogt had been our von Stolzing................Obviously I am not referring to Sach's great monologue and the scenes involving Bechmesser, all up to par but only to von Stolzing. It's not terrible, but it just doesn't sound right.

I do not know if the reduced orchestration was used (or for the Tristan for that matter). A house the size of the current Glyndebourne hardly needs what is deemed necessary for the Ring--although San Francisco has used the reduced orchestration because the pit couldn't accommodate the  number of  players that Wagner asked for. But as Meistersingers go this performance ranks up with Bayreuth I and Deutsche Oper. The production has been moved up to the Regency period. As time traveling goes this is not as radical as the current production at Bayreuth. Both Bayreuth I and Deutsche Oper seem to be all over the place as far as costumes go; clearly in the past but no clearly defined era. Only the vienna performance is anchored in the 16th century but prospect of seeing Botha in tights is not a pretty picture and Otto Schenk's production is prosaic. For those who require a truly period Meistersinger the Met's (also Otto Schenk)production trumps vienna although Levine's tempi can be lethargic.",1353888000,9,3964,4.719653179190751

8527768,5,B008GY8R98,"This is possibly the best opera video I've ever seen. I watch a lot of opera videos. I teach an opera appreciation class and show a lot of opera videos.

I am also a life-long Wagner fanatic, but Die Meistersinger was a bit of a problem child for me, better seen than heard. The old Hamburg Opera video with Giorgio Tozzi is great, but is heavily cut. The Met videos have strengths and flaws. But THIS! Every element of the production is extraordinary, including some of the most beautiful stage lighting I've ever seen. (I was a theater design student before I became an opera singer, so I notice these things.) The David McVicar production updates the time from the 16th century to the 1820s, the time of Wagner's youth, but aside from that there are no liberties taken. Although the staging is by-and-large traditional, there are some details that break with tradition, making this a more intimate experience of this very long and grand piece. Sets and costumes are loaded with color and detail. The experience is almost cinematic.

Gerald Finley sings Hans Sachs with firm, robust lyricism that is at times jaw-droppingly, achingly, gorgeous. Younger than the traditional portrayal of Sachs, he is a recent widower who also lost two children. And he drinks. And he really wants Eva, but knows he isn't over his first wife, so....All this makes for a very interesting character, and Finley is actor enough to show us all of this. The rest of the cast, even the choristers, are equally fleshed out characters, and there is never a want for activity onstage.

And vocally, there are no real weak spots. Marco Jentszch may be a little young for such a long role as Walther, but his callowness serves the character and a very few slightly unsteady moments do not detract.  Anna Gabler sings Eva with great beauty of tone, and great beauty and grace in her acting as well. David and Lena are a young couple here, and Michaela Selinger matches Ms. Gabler well. Topi Lehtipuu, in the long, difficult, and often thankless role of David makes the most of every moment he is on stage. Veteran bass Alastair Miles leads an able and distinguished group of  Mastersingers. Mats Almgren as the night watchman sings with a rich, sonorous tone.

Much has been written about the character of Sixtus Beckmesser, the town clerk who contrives to cheat his way to winning the song contest and the hand of the town's wealthiest man's daughter. Much of what has been written is crap, as the interviews among the discs' special features make clear. But as performed here by Johannes Martin Krnzle, Beckmesser is a clearly conflicted character. Bearing a strange resemblance to Wagner himself, Krnzle sings with gorgeous baritonal warmth, not the all-to-usual whining, leaving no doubt as to why he is a Mastersinger.

Vladimir Jurowski leads the London Philharmonic and Glyndebourne Chorus in a performance that is fleet but never rushed, with a chamber music clarity. Even the second act's fugal riot scene keeps the parts clear.

I've watched this video three times, and still get tingly and teary eyed.",1515456000,4,3084,4.838709677419355
8527769,5,B008GY8R98,"I've loved Meistersinger since hearing records in my college days in the 1960's. Until quite recently, the standard performance on DVD has been from the Metropolitan Opera in New York.  If you want to experience the greatest opera singers doing a traditional Meistersinger, that's your bet. But this recording is something quite different. This is now my very favorite opera recording.

Many people are unaware that Meistersinger is a romantic comedy, or as I sometimes refer to it, ""A 5-Hour, Teutonic Laff Riot.""
The problem is that Wagner wrote the libretto in rather obscure German, and many of the jokes are lost in the translation to subtitles.  So this particular opera cannot be translated easily into English.  The libretto is entirely in rhyming couplets (did I mention in German?), sort of a cultural precursor to Hamilton, and much of the humor relies on grammatical errors in German,

The first time I saw Meistersinger,  back in 1970, the production was identical to the Metropolitan Opera recording.  It is a modestly humorous production with the easily-understood humor found mostly in Act Two.  It is a traditional performance, very much in line with grand opera at the Met.  The singing is superb and the orchestra beautifully led by James Levine..  So if Grand Opera is your thing, the Met recording is grand opera, perfectly led and sung, a very civilized performance, and you will find yourself laughing (or bemusedly smiling and giggling a bit) in Act Two.

The Opus Arte recording on Blu-Ray is completely different.  This production has more in common with a beer bust than grand opera.  .  During the third act scene with the singing contest, little kids (maybe 6-8 years old) are seen passing a beer between themselves, rather like modern teenagers passing a joint, and the onstage celebration is punctuated by jugglers, men on stilts, and lusty, noisy dancing.  In the Met recording.the Dance of the Apprentices is a very civilized, quiet country dance.  Not so on Opus Arte.  There the dance is staged as a very noisy, beer fueled, foot-stomping affair, putting us all in the mood for Midsummer's Day celebrations. . The cast of the mastersingers ( a male chorus of 9 members) is comprised of a bunch of actually old men (as noted in the text), one of whom carries around an ear trumpet  (as a 19th century hearing aid) throughout the opera.

The singing is mostly fine, though not always at the level found at the Met.  Special mention must be given to Gerald Finley who plays the cobbler Hans Sachs.  He is very young by most standards (Sachs is a widower)  but he carries the part off very well, with wonderful acting together with beautiful singing.  Also to be specially mentioned is Marco Jentzsch as Walter, the romantic lead.  He is a lyric tenor, very rare for any Wagner production.  (In the Met recording, Walter is heroic tenor Ben Heppner.  This fellow looks like he could beat up Mike Tyson..  Jentzsch is very tall (my estimate
about 8 ft 3 in.) and quite lean.  Heppner is huge next to him, the operatic elephant in the room.. Another special performance is Topi Lehtipuu as David, Hans Sachs's apprentice.  As envisioned by Lehtipuu, David has a real attitude about being drafted to teach Walter all of the rules of mastersinging so Walter can win the contest the very next day.  He carries himself like a dancer, and uses his physicality to project a complex character, not your average, 40-year-old David of other performances..

Also deserving of special note is the performance of Johannes Martin Kraenzle as Sixtus Beckmesser, the town clerk.  When he loses the song contest, he projects real pathos, in the midst of all the celebrations around him for the third act song contest.  He actually produces a tear rolling down his cheek, a truly stark contrast to the happy emotions around  as Walter wins the contest.

Enough for the men.  Anna Gabler is our Eva, daughter of the town's richest man.  Her father has literally pimped her out to marry whoever wins the song contest. She sings with a beautiful voice and acts with transparent emotion.  Fun to watch.  In most productions, the part of Magdalena is played as a rather straight nurse to Eva.  But in this performance she's played by Michaela Selinger as a sexy vixen, ready to bed David (her boyfriend)  if he helps Walter to become a Mastersinger and win the contest. I am afraid the entire Metropolitan Opera Company would melt in place if Magdalena offered to go to bed with David.  She is a delight to watch, although to turn her into a real deep-voiced mezzo-soprano will take a couple more years of maturity..

The orchestra is led by one Vladimir Jurowski.  He gets a very wide dynamic range out of the orchestra, and generally makes beautiful music . He uses grand pauses for wonderful dramatic effect.

Put simply, I cannot recommend this recording too strongly.  It is very emotional, funny, sometimes to the level of hilarious, and a wonderful introduction to Richard Wagner.  'Nuff Said.",1496016000,3,5007,4.8364705882352945
8527770,5,B008GY8R98,"This is the best Meistersinger available. The relatively small size of the Glyndebourne house enables the conductor and director to cast singers who are the real age and physique of their characters (no 40-year old portly David here!), and Gerald Finley as a *young* middle-aged Sachs plays the rueful recognition that Eva needs a younger man in a very much more moving way than the much older Sachses offered by other productions.

David McVicar's updating to the time of Wagner's own youth fits the opera like a glove, and makes us see just how much of his own creativity, and frustration with academic music teachers, Wagner poured into Walther von Stolzing (Marco Jentzsch). The other principals are excellent (especially  Anna Gabler as Eva), too, and so are the individual Meistersinger. Barry Millington's controversial assertion that in Beckmesser Wagner was characterising and demeaning Jewish musicians is deliberately avoided, and the pathos - as well as the comedy - of Beckmesser's comeuppance are much more moving for the audience as a result. Musically also the performance under the young baton of Vladimir Jurowski reflects a life-affirming energy which infects the whole production.

8527773,2,B008GY8R98,"This is a pretty good production of Meistersinger, the same production I sat thru not just once but TWICE at San Francisco Opera last November ... all 12 hours!

And I enjoyed it immensely.  So when I say 'pretty good', that is not meant as pejorative.  Yes, I would enjoy it even more if it were set in the correct period, that is 15th or 16th century rather than 19th.  Other than that it is 100% traditional, and I'd have no problem watching it over and over again.

There is one other interesting aspect I would like to mention, that is that the character of Beckmesser was played straight, rather than buffoonishly or instantly dislikable.  His lute was in tune, and his love song in earnest, both delicately and confidently, with a gentle smile on his face as if he had no idea how terrible it really was. I am not sure this was Wagner's intention, but could be considered a legitimate artistic interpretation, and in my opinion it worked very well (although I may not want it to become the new standard).

Now as to the low rating, that is not because of the production, which as I say was enjoyable.  Rather, it is the surprisingly bad recorded sound.  From the beginning it sounded as if both orchestra and singers were covered with authentic 15th-century woolen blankets.  No amount of knob-twiddling would fix it (and I am not used to knob-twiddling with Blu-Rays).  Still I endured it for a while because I hoped it would get better, as I so wanted a positive souvenir of having seen it live twice in one month.

But all good things must come to an end, and I couldn't make it past the end of Act I.  The big ensemble sounded so terrible, so jumbled, so low-fidelity, I could not continue.  I have never been so disappointed by a Blu-Ray before--in fact I would have to go back to first-generation LPs of ca. 1951 to get this kind of sound.  Could it just be my system?  No, I listened to other Blu-Rays, DVDs, CDs, and LPs both before and after, and they sounded fine as always.

8527776,5,B008GY8R98,"Staging Wagner on a smaller opera theater stage, such as Glyndebourne, is not a trivial task. The booklet included with this Blu-Ray talks almost exclusively about the desire to produce Wagner within the constraints of the stage's physical limitations.  Director David McVicar wisely took advantage of the fact that all the protagonists in this opera are real, actual human beings - not gods or demi-gods - with emotions, doubts, faults, and who are, most importantly, far from being totally perfect or totally imperfect. He created a production that could be easily be categorized as a profound and intimate production of Meistersingers.  This is even more noticeable because of the camera shots.  At some points you forget that this was a staged production, as it looks more like a movie where the images are focused on the characters and their emotions and internal struggles.  In addition, the singers acting is very believable, far from some static acting I have seen in other productions.
As a whole, the singers do a very good job. You could criticize their vocalization here and there, but the point is to watch and listen the opera as a whole, and it comes across incredibly well.  The quintet in Act Three is just a marvelous and perfect piece of music that, interestingly, totally contradicts Wagners own theories about how opera should be composed.
This production is set around 1800 instead of the original 16th century Nurnberg. It also looks more English than German.  It works very well; personal and intimate scenes are wonderful, as are those with a multitude of people on stage.  Even the pandemonium at the end of Act Two, dreaded by any producer, is well managed and not overwhelming.
The sound and the images are of very good quality.  The overture, played at the appropriate sound level (Master Audio 5.1), fills the space as it should.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
My only (small) complaint is that I wish the pamphlet accompanying the 2 discs would have detailed the directors and conductors views of this opera.

I have seen several productions including a traditional period production at the Met and a bizarre minimalist production at the Dutch National Opera.  This falls somewhere in between those extreme examples.  The setting of this production has been updated to the 19th century Nurenberg, but everything was done tastefully.  As some reviewers noted, the decision to keep Hans Sachs relatively young in this production was a good choice and it certainly added an interesting twist to the group dynamics.  Gerald Finley as Hans Sachs and Johannes Martin Krnzle as Sixtus Beckmesser were quite magnificent in their acting and singing.  Finley's intense portrayal of Sachs was an interestingly juxtaposed to Krnzle's sensitive and lighthearted portrayal of Beckmesser.  They really brought so much to this production.  I loved the fact that there are so many intricate and interesting details on the stage.  The ending was unusual and was rather moving.  I really enjoyed this production.

I am giving this Blu-ray video five stars with some reservations.  First, I found Anna Gabler to be a good actress, but her singing was slightly underwhelming.  The same thing can be said of Topi Lehtipuu who played David.  Second, Marco Jentzsch who was playing Walther von Stolzing simply didn't fit into this production.  His singing and acting skills were clearly deficient.  This was a rather big disappointment for me.  Third, the stage lighting was uneven and rather harsh and as a result, parts of singers faces were over-exposed and looked rather unnatural to me.  This production isn't for everyone, but its refreshing approach at least deserves to be seen at least once by Wagner fans.",1420934400,,1795,5.13103448275862
