8397152,4,B003HLVPOY,"""The Mystery Trooper"" is a 10 chapter serial produced in 1931 by Harry S. Webb, under the ""Wonder Serials"" name, directed by Stuart Paton and released by Syndicate Pictures.  The story is by Flora E. Douglas, with continuity and dialogue by Carl Krusada.  While it has been called the worst serial ever made, such an honour depends on how ""worst"" is defined, and while certainly a top contender it helps illustrate how the ""Poverty Row"" producers dealt with making early sound films.  My ""4-star"" rating is mostly from finding that Grapevine's DVD was from the original version, and not an indication of the merits of the serial or of the transfer quality.

The story has Jack Logan (Robert Frazer) inheriting half a map from his uncle, who years earlier had quarreled with his partner over discovery of a lost Indian gold mine near Moosehead, somewhere in Canada.  Jack goes to Moosehead, but is followed by a gangster, Mack (Charles King) who plots with Jean Gregg (Al Ferguson), trading post operator and leader of a smuggling ring, to get the half map.  Elsewhere near Moosehead, two orphans, Helen (Blanche Mehaffey) and her younger brother Billy (Buzz Barton) live with their foster father, Chief Red Eagle (William Bertram).  They  have been receiving pouches of gold nuggets, thrown through the window of their cabin by a mysterious friend.  They exchange these at the trading post for money and supplies, which doubtless includes replacement window glass.  Jean Gregg believes they know more about the source of the gold than they are telling, and instructs his gang to abduct them and Jack at the gang's headquarters, an abandoned hotel in Ghost City.  Jack is captured first, but is released, so he can help Helen and Billy, by a man in a Mounted Police uniform with his face covered, who enters the room through a secret panel.

And the mystery continues for the remaining chapters, with the Mounted Police trying to find the gang of smugglers, and the two halves of the map changing hands.  The Mystery Trooper resides somewhere beneath the hotel, and occasionally plays an organ; while the sound disturbs the gangsters they haven't discovered its source.  They communicate by radio, and their equipment is also used by The Mystery Trooper to send anonymous messages to the Mounties.

While the writing, acting and directing cannot be described as good, the age of the film is partially to blame, the transition to sound being especially difficult for the ""Poverty Row"" studios.  Spoken lines had to be clearly enunciated to be understood over the primitive sound systems in theatres of the time, and many actors were uncomfortable with the microphones.  In this respect Robert Frazer doesn't do badly, and is fine in the action scenes, though his expressions of affection for Helen are less convincing.  Blanche Mehaffey had been in films since 1923, but while her only previous talking picture was a 'Poverty Row' Western, she has little trouble with her few spoken lines.  Buzz Barton was already a veteran of talking serials, having appeared in Mascot's ""The Lone Defender"" the previous year.  Charles King is his usual reliable self as Mack, and White Cloud does a good job of appearing to be a horse, with better acting skills than most of the humans, though his dialogue is limited.  Al Ferguson as Jean Gregg (first name pronounced ""Gene"") probably had less dialogue than White Cloud in his previous sound film, and here he sometimes tries using a ""French"" accent.  He did better in his later films, and probably wasn't saddled with lines like ""Just wait...I have another plan.""  Sadly, this isn't followed by ""that cannot fail.""  And the fist fights are a long way from being well-choreographed.  Harry S. Webb produced another serial in 1931, ""The Sign of the Wolf"" and while dialogue, story and acting aren't any better, some subtle humor helps make it more tolerable.  But some allowance should be made for ""The Mystery Trooper"" since it is the earlier of the two, and there is some intentional humor.  It isn't every old 'B' Western where a horse outwits Charles King, as happens in Chapter Six, providing an unusual cliffhanger with the bad guy imperiled.

The serial was reissued in mid-1930's by Guaranteed Pictures, who retitled it ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"" and renamed all the chapters.  The new titles misspelled Blanche Mehaffey's last name as ""Mehaffy"" and new music was used, but the rest of the film was unchanged.  This edition is the one most commonly encountered.

For most purposes, the better transfer is the old one on VHS from VCI, #1778, with the source print from the Guaranteed Pictures reissue.  The image is fairly sharp, not badly scratched or dirty, and well framed.  While the contrast is sometimes a little high, with the exception of the black cat in the chapter recaps it isn't hard to see what's going on, even in the darker scenes.  But there are some significant small pieces missing, including one in the opening scene, where the reason for the map being in two pieces was explained.  This appears in the last chapter as a ""flashback"" but its initial absence makes the story harder to follow.  The first chapter is about a minute short, the others seem to be reasonably complete, and while the sound for Guaranteed Pictures' replacement main title theme is harsh and ""tinny,"" the original music with the chapter recap text is less distorted and the dialogue is clear enough.  Fortunately not much was done to ""clean up"" the background noise which is at a lower level than might be feared from something this old.  The revised release from Guaranteed Pictures had ""next week"" titles at the chapter ends, but VCI's print of Chapter One is slightly truncated.  They created a new ""next week"" title, but it doesn't match the style used by Guaranteed Pictures, and it mixes the ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"" name with the chapter title from the original release.

Grapevine's edition, on two single-layer DVD-R discs is not as easy to watch.  Their print was in pretty bad shape, with dirt, film deterioration or both, and apparently a reduction print made from a negative, having quite a bit of ""white hair"" in the frame in some chapters.  There are also white pieces of something, maybe film bits or flaked-off emulsion that occasionally get in the film gate.  A further annoyance is that the image often shifts vertically, as if someone was messing with the ""framing"" adjustment during one of the transfers, mostly near the beginning of the chapters.  But the contrast and gray scale are not bad, and the sound during the chapters, while a little muffled, allows the dialogue to be understood.  There are fewer splices than in the VCI edition, but still some small missing pieces.  The titles are the main advantage since, if the sound during them is especially feeble, they are from the original ""Mystery Trooper"" version.  Blanche Mehaffey's name is spelled correctly, and while the hero's is ""Fraser"" instead of ""Frazer"" it might be what he was using at the time.  There is a credit ""Recorded by Ralph M. Like"" that is missing from the Guaranteed reissue, but of more interest is the original title music.  Unfortunately it is only suggested, buried in strange tinkling sounds doubtless from a noise-reduction scheme, though some chapters suggest it better than others.  The original chapter titles are all present, but at the ends, instead of an elaborate ""Don't Miss...At This Theatre Next Week"" there is just a simple ""To Be Continued"" title which is likely how the original film was issued.  A surprise was that the last chapter title is ""The Lost Indian Mine"" and not ""The Lost Treasure"" as indicated in most references, including Grapevine's package.

Update, 2 June 2013: Alpha now has an edition on DVD-R, # ALP 6862D, from a print source similar to that used for the VCI tape.  It is from Guaranteed Pictures' ""Trail of the Royal Mounted"" reissue, but Alpha has replaced the main title with ""Mystery Trooper"" (not ""The Mystery Trooper"") pasted onto a background picture from the reissue titles.  Some chapters have titles and credits in ""freeze frame"" where the original film was in bad shape.  The end of Chapter One appears to be complete and has the ""next week"" title from the reissue.  Other pieces that were missing from VCI's tape are also gone here, and Alpha's copy is missing the 40-second intro to the recap text of each chapter where a note wrapped around a rock is thrown through a window.  The sound and picture quality on most chapters are about the same as VCI's tape, the image fairly sharp with tolerable gray scale, but start of Chapter Seven has what looks like videotape tracking problems, a lot of noise toward the bottom of the screen especially in the recap text.  Also, some of the darker scenes in this chapter have an ""interference"" pattern that looks like digital compression artifacts that shouldn't be there since the disc is two layer.  Unfortunately this is a two-layer ""burned"" (DVD+R) disc, and with the copy I got the last three chapters couldn't be accessed when tried on two SONY DVD players, both compatible with DVD+R DL discs, though I found it would play on my Magnavox DVD recorder.  Maybe I got an isolated defective disc, but my guess is that Alpha got something wrong in their processing of this title.

The serial itself is hard to recommend even at the standard dose of one chapter at a time.  It is not entertaining in the same manner as more-recent examples with bad dialogue, such as ""Radar Men from the Moon,"" and it is too carefully made to be in a class with the ""Poverty Row"" westerns produced by Victor Adamson and Robert J. Horner.  Those who appreciate ""The Sign of the Wolf"" might be amused at some of the similarities, including the ""killer dogs,"" ""enormous bear,"" Al Ferguson and the number of windows broken by pouches of gold nuggets or by notes wrapped around rocks.  For those who actually want to watch this primitive sound serial, VCI's old VHS release has far better picture and sound, while Grapevine's DVD is of greater historic interest.  The recent Alpha disc is only a little worse than the VCI tape in completeness and picture quality, but may not work even on players compatible with double-layer burned media.  But given the alternatives, Alpha's DVD might be worth risking the small amount it costs.",1332288000,2,10344,4.853644646924829
