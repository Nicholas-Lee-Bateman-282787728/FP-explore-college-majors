8409307,5,B003YI1YRS,"This is a two disc DVD package. Disc 1 is a behind the scenes documentary of concerts in Africa, the UK and the studio in Maastrich.
Disc 2 is the concert in Africa with some very interesting interviews and insight into the humanitarian side of Andre. Of course as always the music and entertainment is wonderful. Would recommend this DVD set to anyone.",1446681600,,353,4.619047619047619

8409309,5,B003YI1YRS,"One of my favorite DVDs!....  Kimi Skota's lullaby was so touching and her rendition of My African Dream was compelling!  Also thoroughly enjoyed the ""Extras""!  The promoter's accolades for Andre and what he did to promote unity on his tour through South Africa were more than well deserved - I highly recommend this one for anybody, fan or not!",1425859200,2,345,4.813559322033898
8409310,5,B003YI1YRS,"THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE BY ALL. BE SURE TO WATCH BOTH DISCS - #1 FIRST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE STORY. OUR NEW SOPRANO IS WONDERFUL. SINCE WATCHING AFRICAN DREAM, WE HAVE PURCHASED OTHER DVDS WITH HER AND HER THREE COMPADRES.....MIRUSIA, CARMEN, SUZAN, AND BEFORE SHE WENT ON TO BEING A PROFESSIONAL OPERA SINGER...CARLA.
AN INCREDIBLE STORY AND VERY HEARTHWARMING.",1425254400,,372,5.216666666666667
