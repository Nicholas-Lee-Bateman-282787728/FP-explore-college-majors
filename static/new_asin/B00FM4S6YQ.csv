6014552,4,B00FM4S6YQ,"What happens when you combine Ponies, Unicorns, Pegasus', Breezeies (bug like ponies with wings and antennae) and dragons? You get some wild adventures that teach lessons like being true to yourself, compromising, and taking responsibility for your actions.
Many of these episodes are hard to find, so this collection is a good deal and essential for any My Little Pony lover.",1389916800,10,376,5.180327868852459

6014565,5,B00FM4S6YQ,"OK, strictly speaking, I DON'T love it.  MY GRAND-DAUGHTER LOVES IT.  She can watch these darn things over and over and over again.
OK what age group, you ask?  Well, she liked it at age 3, still loves it age 4, and it probably has a couple more years to run with her.  The colors are splendid, the music is happy, the voices are cute, the lessons are gentle.  It even soothed our youngest grandson age 4 months, when he was (I think) colicky and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE could soothe him---the Pretty Ponies did the trick.  Honest.  Like.....magic.  Didn't put him to sleep--just had him fascinated!",1425859200,,599,4.584905660377358

6014581,4,B00FM4S6YQ,"Princess Promenade and The Runaway Rainbow are among the best of G3's animation with only the separately released A Very Minty Christmas and Twinkle Wish Adventure rivaling them.  Friends Are Never Far Away is only decent but is good worldbuilding for things like A Very Minty Christmas. Dancing in the Clouds is actually sorta subpar but is probably required since it takes place before Friends Are Never Far Away.  The problem comes from all this not being in chronological order.  G3 has a pretty clear continuity until it gets rebooted for the Core 7 revamp, yet the movies seem to just be randomly packaged on the discs.  There's a lot more sing-a-longs that could have been on here than there was.  Perhaps the most glaring omission is that the mini episode Greetings From Unicornia was left out of the collection...despite being really short and actually being a pack-in with the original DVD release.  The menus don't seem optimized for a computer since many of the titles require you to click an icon on the side instead of clicking the text directly.

Despite some of the issues, it's still good to have this and the price is quite reasonable.  Hopefully, Shout Factory will release the rest of G3 along with G1 and My Little Pony Tales.",1397520000,6,1247,4.767441860465116

6014583,5,B00FM4S6YQ,"These videos are very sweet. The best is ""The Runaway Rainbow"". We like the implied mythology of the Pegasus Ponies in this version. The relationship between Star Catcher and her magic butterflies is a source of endless speculation between me and my 6yo.  We have some books that seem to feature the butterflies sans Star Catcher as well- very mysterious! Friendship is Magic it ain't, but this era definitely has its own charm.",1393891200,3,428,4.863013698630137
