8542952,5,B009M4KTRO,"I watch this movie over again and again,  I just love Jean Arthur!  There is a young William Holden that I didn't recognize at first.  What a handsome lad he was.  Jean plays the only American woman in Arizona territory, how she lived and fought to survive a mostly male population after the death of her father, and how she meets Holden, a restless soul.  Very well put together.  I recommend it.",1405036800,,397,4.444444444444445
8542953,4,B009M4KTRO,"I was actually surprised that I enjoyed Arizona so much.
I am currently researching movie history with an eye on  movie locations. I knew that Old Tucson was built for the movie Arizona but had never seen the film or knew anyone who had seen it. What a touch of genius to build a movie ranch in such a beautiful location.
 It was fun to see William Holden as a young actor just developing his skills of horse riding and fighting that would show up in his later The Wild Rovers and iconic The Wild Bunch. I do not recall seeing Jean Arthur before;if I did it must have been in a very different role. She and Holden worked well together. Although they were cliche' their characters occasionally show a degree of humanity.
As I  said a very pleasant surprise. I would recommend Arizona to any western movie fan (or any fan of William Holden).",1370131200,,839,4.4
