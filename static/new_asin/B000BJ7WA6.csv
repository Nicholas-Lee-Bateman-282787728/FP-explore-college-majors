2420627,5,B000BJ7WA6,It's a great DVD in great condition.  It's just long enough to do before I leave for class.,1183334400,,91,4.055555555555555
2420628,5,B000BJ7WA6,"This is the first Yoga Booty Ballet workout I tried. My normal work out is 45 minutes on the elliptical and then 30 minutes weight training 4 days week so I am not new to exercise.  At first I was a little skeptical about how much of a workout this 35 minute program would provide, but I gave it a shot and by the end I was completly sweating.  It was a blast!  I learned a few new moves and felt like I worked all the muscles in my body.  Now instead of 4 times a week on the elliptical, I'm doing 6-7 days of Cardio Cabaret Burlesque and I can definitely see a tightening in my hips and booty.  But the best part is how sexy you feel doing it How many workouts can you say that about?",1181692800,6,686,3.906474820143885
2420629,5,B000BJ7WA6,"I just received this workout in today and I have to say I LOVE IT!  I just started using YBB workouts, and I was not sure if i would enjoy them.  But i definately do.  I am not sure if someone who is new to working out would find these easy to follow.  I have been working out for several years and found the workout easy to follow.  I was extremely challenged and after the second time using it, i felt more relaxed and was able to really get into it.  When I was done,,,I was sweating and felt my body had received a great workout.  I am not to into the beginning of the workouts with the floor part, but I have just been fast forwarding by it and start with the warm-up and then right into the workout.  I have now purchased five of the YBB workouts and I love them all.  I actually have my 15 year daughter trying them also...it is alot of fun for us both.  If you have never tried YBB, start with light @ easy as I did.  It came as a two disc set with latin flavor and these two really helped me get into the YBB workouts.  HAVE FUN!!!!",1177286400,11,1041,3.951923076923077
2420630,4,B000BJ7WA6,"I had a lot of fun being silly and still working out. I love to dance and this is the perfect workout for a goofy girl like me. I went to work the next day and showed some of the moves to a friend, he now wants to come over and do the workout with me. I heart YBB.",1147305600,6,264,3.4915254237288136
2420631,5,B000BJ7WA6,"Love it, thank you.",1418515200,,19,4.0
2420632,2,B000BJ7WA6,I did not care for this video at all and the video quality itself wasn't all that good. Some of the images were blurry and the steps hard to follow. I would not recommend it. Sorry,1416096000,,180,4.027777777777778
2420633,5,B000BJ7WA6,"This dvd kept me entertained throughout its entirety, the moves are fun, but also a workout. Would definitely recommend to someone who wants a little break from a more vigorous workout routine.",1394841600,,193,5.0625
2420634,5,B000BJ7WA6,Great workout! It works your total body. Its fun & keeps you going through out the entire workout. 2 thumbs up!,1391904000,,111,4.333333333333333
2420635,5,B000BJ7WA6,I have other Yoga Booty Ballet discs and enjoy them but I love this one. The moves are sexy and fun to do it's over before you know it and you have gotten in a work out.,1389484800,,169,3.5945945945945947
2420636,4,B000BJ7WA6,"this was a fun workout. the girls have a lot of energy. however i think it is for the beginer i still like it from time to time. but do not expect a killer hard core workout, this is for fun!",1382140800,,191,3.682926829268293
2420637,3,B000BJ7WA6,"I want to like this DVD, especially since everyone seems to be having such a great time, but it has too many things wrong with it.  It was a library loan, and I chose to do it one evening when my regular cardio class was cancelled.  First off, it's 30 minutes long....really, a 30 minute DVD?  With no extra features?  That's pretty cheap.  And only 30 minutes for cardio?  That's not a long time, you really don't start sweating and getting the heart rate going enough to do any good until the 20 minute mark so an extra 10 is not really all that beneficial.  And while I never had dance lessons I've always caught onto steps quickly....if they're explained to me, just once is all I need but I need it.  With only a 30 minute routine (did I mention it's only 30 minutes long?) there would have been plenty of time available on the disc for a quick optional demonstration of the moves.  The fact is, I can't benefit from a workout if I'm standing studying how to do the moves, you can't just call out ""come hither"" and expect me to know what you're doing.  Finally, fine if you want to throw in all that yoga language but know that many of us are not yoga-savvy and an explanation of the terms you are using would have been educational for me as well as to help me understand why the move is helpful and what it does.  No explanation of terms, no demonstration of moves and too short a cardio workout.  However, what I did do was fun, and I suppose plenty of people would overlook my complaints...or do it enough times that they finally get the moves even without a demonstration.  But if you're looking for good cardio, I think there are better DVDs out there.",1380412800,,1662,4.32258064516129
2420638,1,B000BJ7WA6,"This work out is not very difficult, and it's not really all that fun either. To be honest, I got so bored with the dance routine towards the end of it that I didn't even want to finish it. I probably won't even ever use this DVD again. If you want a good dance-based work out I'd say you should stick with Zumba!",1377216000,,313,3.984126984126984
2420639,4,B000BJ7WA6,"its a little fast, but Im getting the hang of it.  I def am sweating when im not even half way thru!!",1361664000,,101,3.590909090909091
2420640,2,B000BJ7WA6,"This DVD is for a beginner who is not used to dance fitness.
The movements were totally awkward and not very imaginative. I like the instructors but this is not for me.",1361232000,,168,4.28125
2420641,5,B000BJ7WA6,"Love this workout!! It is not as burlesque style as I thought but I still love it. Its very fun and gets you moving! Although it might take you a few times doing it to pick up all the dance moves, I still highly recommend it. Another awesome plus is the instructor are very positive and upbeat (and a little silly!) I will definitely be purchasing more in the YBB series.",1361145600,2,371,4.23943661971831
2420642,5,B000BJ7WA6,"I like how this is a high energy, fun dance routine.  I enjoy setting an intention at the beginning and then following the two teachers as they alternate giving directions.  There are many students of different sizes and they all do things their own way.",1358035200,,254,4.622222222222222
2420643,5,B000BJ7WA6,"These girls are hilarious! When did you ever laugh and enjoy yourself during a workout? My friend and I have so much fun laughing with these girls and watching the guy in the back do the routine as well. Pure comedy! As for the workout, they are quite creative. I love the beginning with the drums and mantras; this actually attracted me to kundalini yoga in which I have also started doing. I wish they had more yoga tapes because they are kind of calming and soothing in the beginning with the combo of Ravi's drums. And then the cardio is an easy to follow dance routine that will also crack you up. Come on- don't we need a bit of cheesiness and laughs to motivate ourselves? The best issue is that I believe this series is perfect for beginners or in my case (injured in the shoulder). They do not do any moves that are taxing to the joints and the intensity is low enough for someone starting an aerobic program.

As another viewer stated, you can do the cardio twice or increase your own intensity. I usually do the moves bouncing or with more high-impact moves. I have had to put my exercise regime on hold for several months due to my injury and now have to do more careful routines that will not complicate my shoulder that loves to dislocate. This routine delivers for me. I can do most of this without moving my bad arm and I do not have to bounce, but it still gives me some cardio. I am using this routine with yoga and other moderate or low key exercises to keep me in shape until after my upcoming surgery. The ballet is also great in the end to help do some toning. These girls are just so motivational and I think that this should be someone's first choice who needs to work up their fitness levels and get some motivation. Or for the more advanced exerciser who wants to have fun and turn the routine up a notch with higher intensity. Another reviewer does this routine with her daughter. I think this is a great idea for those who want to laugh and bond with their kids. I have enough fun doing this with my friend. Love these girls!",1335571200,2,2053,4.304909560723514
2420644,2,B000BJ7WA6,"There is cute music and people in this video but the workout is just not much of a workout. I did not even break a sweat or feel like it was even the least bit challenging. I felt that the movement were choppy and just didn't blend from one exercise to the next. There was some eastern ""OM"" type breathing and exercises which I thought were just weird. There wasn't much burlesque/cabaret to it. I thought it would be fun but it just wasn't all that fun in my opinion.",1298678400,3,468,4.211111111111111
2420645,2,B000BJ7WA6,"I am not one who is interested in meditation type workouts so this one isn't for me. I watched the video to determine if I could just omit the meditation at the beginning and work from there and the cardio part seems very energetic, possibly fun and is maybe something I can do, but I was disappointed with the lack of description of the moves prior to going into them. The moves are all thrown together making it easy to get lost in transition. The routine contains so many different moves as well that it is so easy to get confused for a beginner or someone who has not completely memorized the entire routine. This makes working out with this DVD pointless since you are unable to follow the moves. It was very annoying to say the least and I am not sure that I am even going to attempt it at all.",1296000000,,800,4.235294117647059
2420646,5,B000BJ7WA6,"This workout is so fun!  It's definitely worth every penny! I buy workout dvds all the time, but I've never stuck to them before, this workout is so fun next thing you know you'll be sweating. It's a little hard to keep up at first, but it's worth keeping up with.",1257552000,3,264,4.176470588235294
2420647,5,B000BJ7WA6,"I just had a baby and got 3 herniated disc's because of it. I was stuck on a couch for 7months and got up to 220lbs when they got the pain management under control. I checked with my doctor and got the ok. Dont forget to talk to you doctor if your hurt everyones different.

They are upbeat and suppostive. Takes a little to get used to the matra's but they are great for getting your mind in shape, in the game, and help you workout out more often. At first I was limited to the moves I could do being so out of shape and my muscles left in horrible condition from not using them for 7months after having a baby and being overweight on top of it. So they really helped me keep going.

This disk I loved. I had to rewind alot to learn the moves and it wasn't until about the 5th time (i suck at danceing) did I learn them all. And I still had fun. Yes the girls are silly, positive, and upbeat. Yes at first I did feel silly trying to learn the moves but that goes away as you learn them.  It shows you a move you do it a few times and they add to the end and start over from the time until its done.  This is my favorite workout by them. It's fun, energetic, you do get a workout at the same.

For the ones that are more fit you can easily double your workout either with another of their discs or getting on a bike or go for a run if its not enough because its FUN FUN FUN. Your more fit so go for it. After a 6months I started either doing it twice or doing something else for at least 15mins. I just paused the cool down at the end and come back to it or put in a different disc if it was on a day I had time. Or do it at the end of one of their others as a reward.",1243468800,7,1669,3.7844827586206895
2420648,5,B000BJ7WA6,"As a person who is overwieght I was able to easily get my heart rate up and do all of the moves to the best of my ablity, I got a couple varieties to keep it interesting but really as an aerobic exercise not bad, I think after I lose a litte wieght it will get easier, and then I will really enjoy it more.",1190419200,3,306,3.723076923076923
2420649,4,B000BJ7WA6,"I love the ""zen, in the moment, let's enjoy working out, enjoy your body"" feel of Teigh McDonough & Gillian Marloth. This is about the same easy pace, easy to mimic as their Light & Easy & Latin workouts.
It's set like the picture with at least 6 other women & 1 in good shape guy all in their 20s or early 30s. Most of the women are in great shape or only a few extra pounds so that their excitement & enthusiasm is high & contagious. In the Easy or Latin workouts, the ones who were more then say 30 lbs overweight got tired & barely moved which put a damper on your own enthusiasm.
It starts with only a tiny second of kundalini yoga (much too short), then it's all mostly cabaret dance. There is a woman in the row behind between Teigh & Gillian who looks to have dance school experience & since she doesn't have to teach like them, she seems to get into it the most with a lot of grace & makes the moves look more hip then they are. The moves are very simplified, cutsy, silly, only a few moves that would be considered sexy.
I loved the end point of the small amount of ballet & end stretching. I hope they have workout with that emphasized.
This is great for beginners/those who are out of shape & low endurance or those who are looking for something light, easy & fun. Doing this will make you feel more positive & even want to workout more!
I hope Teigh & Gillian put out more of their Master series or more workout with ballet or balancing exercises.",1185840000,5,1460,4.180851063829787
2420650,4,B000BJ7WA6,"This is my second YBB workout and it certainly gets my sweat going. The whole Eastern mysticism meets LA thing is a little weird but the workouts themselves are alot of fun and get me going. I bought Cardio Cabaret, hoping for some good burlesque style moves. I can't say that it really lived up to my expectations regarding the actual moves but the workout was fun and energizing. I gave it four stars and I'll be using it but don't buy this looking for real dance moves or perfecting your shimmy. Buy it for what it is - a kind of goofy but very entertaining workout that lets you cut loose a bit in your living room.",1185494400,14,619,4.254237288135593
