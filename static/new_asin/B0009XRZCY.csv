2334565,1,B0009XRZCY,It wasn't what I expected the cartoons seemed old they were as if we were watching a black and white tV set. Some cartoons were boring so i fast forward through them. I won't not recommend them to any one. Say your money and buy a real mighty mouse or woody wood pecker dvd.,1366416000,,274,4.092592592592593
2334566,5,B0009XRZCY,This is just as advertised. Great cartoons. Kids today don't have good cartoons like these classics. I recommend this and all classics.,1360454400,3,135,5.181818181818182
2334567,5,B0009XRZCY,"They do have many older cartoons which are hard to find unless on these formats, so I'm pretty happy with them. As a collector, it was a great addition to my collection and I was ecstastic with the price, with so many brand new collectibles being easily $15. to $20. and up.",1210377600,10,274,4.288461538461538

2334569,1,B0009XRZCY,"The Cartoons included in the DVD were ""early"" cartoons. I expected later years such as when they used to have Saturday Cartoon Specials at the local Theaters (...as in ""20-Cartoons:. IE: Andy Panda, Mighty Mouse, etc.

The cartoons delivered should have stated the years made to insure the satisfaction of the purchaser, etc, and list a few of those cartoons that were included. Thank You",1168819200,15,388,4.969230769230769
