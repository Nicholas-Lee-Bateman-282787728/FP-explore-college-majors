Great fun to watch.",1418688000,3,180,4.806451612903226
8324712,5,B00005UPR5,"Oh, this is so charming and ribald and funny and sweet all wrapped together ending in a happily-ever-after sort of ending just like we all know it would! I adore Russell Crowe and cannot help myself to giggle saying it with the same sort of funny giggle he giggles...he, he, he. The cast is super, the script is super and Crowe is super! But he NEEDS to do more comedies! C'mon, Man...I LOVE to see you smile!",1414281600,3,409,4.324675324675325

8324714,3,B00005UPR5,"If you are a Russell Crowe fan, you will like this very early Russell, and an interesting character portrayal. It is a curiously attractive study of three young men trying to find a girl. Russell's character, Arthur, seems to be the most under interested of the three, but in the end.. well, you know Russell will manage to do well.",1394582400,5,332,4.55
8324715,3,B00005UPR5,"There is a great soundtrack of 50s and 50s-style pop songs that you will enjoy.  The script lacks direction and focus, though; there is no center.  What is this about?  The three young guys and their sexual awakening?  One guy's mother and her lover?  It's hard to tell.  This really needed better plotting and dialogue.

One funny thing:  Russell Crowe can produce a high-pitched giggle--which he does several times during the film--which is absolutely hilarious.",1361232000,6,464,5.093333333333334
