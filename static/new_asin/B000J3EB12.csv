While the first video was intended to gently push and motivate new exercisers, this one's a bit more of a challenge. It's a lot more aerobic, with more upper body moves. The program is designed like a boxing match. It's broken down into 10 different ""Rounds."" Each round is about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes long, and each segment gets progressively harder. One fringe benefit was the upper body rotation that boxing seems to provide, which actually helped my stiff lower back. I wouldn't jump right into this program. Something like the first Chubby Hubby would be a better place to start. It's also nice to be able to follow a guy like Larry (he's the featured Chubby Hubby) who I can definately identify with.",1178841600,3,782,4.553191489361702
8148990,1,B000J3EB12,"Let's face facts: if your wife bought this for you, and with this title, that's the only way you'll ever get hold of it, you are seriously overweight and lazy, and she can't tell you to your face. Unfortunately, this regimen is unsuitable for overweight and lazy people, taking you through blood-pressure levitating exercise into heart-attack and stroke territory. Try finding a DVD that focuses more on gentler exercises, such as changing the channel on the TV and opening bags of chips. If you are considering buying this DVD for a couch potato, try getting 50-100lb off their bodyweight through diet and make sure they can walk around the block without paramedic intervention before getting them into cardio workouts. You know it makes sense.",1165795200,4,745,5.016129032258065
