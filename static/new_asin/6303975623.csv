If you can figure out that the center of the drum has a lower tone than an edge slap will produce and if you can keep time by counting to four you don't need these videos. I watched this video, which was suggested by a drum store owner, and at the end thought- That's ALL? You have to be kidding! A complete waste of money.",1115424000,,399,4.181818181818182

Iwas also disappointed when the statment was made that the secret is in the glue. I wish there was a review of this item befor having purchased it,and having to trouble with returning it. Thanks for having the reviews.",992304000,8,397,4.685714285714286
