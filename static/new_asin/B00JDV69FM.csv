6355367,5,B00JDV69FM,"The Auction, from director Sebastien Pilote, has been a selection at numerous film festivals - including Cannes and the TIFF.

 Gaby is an aging farmer. He has worked the family farm alone for over forty year as his brothers wanted no part of it. He and his wife had two daughters. But the girls have left, as has his wife. The constants in his life are his dog, his one friend, the hired boy, the sheep - and the land. He lives a solitary life, but seems content.

 Pilote's cinematography is absolutely beautiful. Rural Quebec was used for the setting. The farm is authentic, the house comfortable and lived in. Pastoral.  Pilote's camera often pauses that extra moment and the viewer can't help but see what Gaby sees.

Gabriel Arcand plays Gaby and I thought he was superb. If I didn't know he was an actor, I would absolutely believe he was a farmer. This character is a man of few words. Arcand's facial expressions, body language and simple actions convey much with few words. His eyes are particularly expressive.

 His oldest daughter Marie arrives for a visit - the joy Gaby experiences at seeing his child and grandchildren is extremely touching. However, Marie has her own reason for visiting - she needs money - $200,000 to be exact. She and her husband are divorcing and she wants to stay in the house. Here, I got angry. Gaby's offer to come and live with him are rebuffed, his inquires into her savings, her husband helping her out are all met with no. I really didn't like Marie - I thought her extremely selfish. Gaby however wants to help her - he loves his children dearly. So....he decides to sell his farm.

 Heartbreaking. In reading the director's notes, Pilote has described his film as a tribute to fatherhood. In that respect he has succeeded. The sacrifices Gaby is willing to make, the losses he is willing to suffer for his children speaks volumes. (But I still couldn't get past not liking Marie)

 The soundtrack is particularly effective, complementing the setting. The ending left me wanting more. And that's a good thing. I would have like to know what happened to Gaby 'after'. The last screen shot of him left me feeling quite sad...while the last shots of his daughters show them enjoying their own pursuits.

 All in all, this is one of the best films I've watched from Film Movement. Absolutely recommended.

 As always, there is a short film included. The Giant - a non verbal animated - was the addition to this feature film. Although I could see the tie in - nature and land - it didn't do much for me.",1411689600,2,2545,4.597345132743363

6355369,5,B00JDV69FM,"Canadian writer/director S&eacute;bastien Pilote has created a fine little film that in many ways plays like an elegy to times past. The film moves slowly, like a gentle stroll in the Canadian countryside, the action is spare, the acting is excellent and the message is exquisite.

Canadian farmer Gaby Gagnon (Gabriel Arcand) tends his sheep on his lovely little farm in northern Quebec and much of the essence of the film is his interaction with the land and the animals that have been his life. He has named the highly regarded farm Bouchard & Sons, hoping his farm will be passed to his sons. But instead of sons he has two daughters - Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique (Sophie Desmarais) and Marie (Lucie Laurier) - and both have moved away from the farm to Montreal and into different lives. Marie and her 2 sons visit Gaby requesting financial support: she has left her husband Steve and needs to buy Steve's half of the house to maintain her family. Gaby wants to help her but realizes that the only source of money he has is Bouchard & Sons, which would mean essentially ending Gaby's home and way of life. It is a conflict well resolved by the writer/director.

The sense of isolation, need, seclusion and yet camaraderie with his fellow farmers who know and love nothing more than the life of a farm makes this a very nostalgic film. Gabriel Arcand is luminous as Gaby and every moment of his struggle we feel intensely. The film score by Serge Nakaushi-Pelletier is at once simple and eloquent and the cinematography by Michel La Veaux captures the essence of the Canadian countryside. In all, this is a gentle, quiet, slow moving film about emotional decisions and family commitment and traditions and it plays very well indeed.

6355370,5,B00JDV69FM,"Set in French speaking Canada `The Auction' tells a simple yet timeless story of a man's love for his children. Gaby is a sheep farmer whose farm has been passed down through the generations. He has worked hard all his life to earn a living from the place - his siblings all ran off a long time ago. His wife also left him twenty years previously and his two daughters have run off to the big city to make a life for themselves.

Then Marie comes visiting and tells him she needs a lot of money as her marriage has gone to pieces. He has very few options but decides to help and all he can do to achieve that is sell everything. This is a very moving and often sad story where the central performance by Gabriel Arcand as Gaby is a triumph. The film is partly inspired by Balzac's novel `Le pere Goriot' and there are some subtle references in the film. The music is beautiful as is the landscape and though the film seems to take its time in places it belies the urgency with which the inevitable is rushing upon us.

I seriously enjoyed this work, it is a simple story but, as all things in life, nothing is ever really simple and dismantling a life's work is never going to be easy. Everyone involved was utterly convincing and all the praise this film has received is entirely justified. This is in French with English sub titles that are all very good and a run time of 111 minutes. This Film Movement presentation also includes a short called `The Giant' and the sleeve notes have part of an interview with the director Sebastien Pilote - completely recommended.",1407024000,8,1568,4.384879725085911
6355371,4,B00JDV69FM,"This Canadian film is in French with English subtitles.  It tells the story of Gaby, a sheepfarmer in Northern Quebec. He is in his sixties and now lives alone, but his life is tranquil and untroubled.  Then one day one of his two daughters arrives.  She has left her husband and is in desperate need of money.  As a loving father Gaby naturally wants to help her, but he must make some difficult decisions that will affect the rest of his life if he is to do so.

This is a gritty, slow moving film geared to the pace of a farm.  There is very little dialogue, but the atmosphere admirably captures what it must be like to live and work in such hardscrabble conditions.  Gabriel Arcand does an excellent job of portraying Gaby, and I was impressed by the rest of the cast as well. Some elements of the story may remind you of Le pere Goriot or even of King Lear, but The Auction also has a simple honesty that is entirely its own.",1406505600,2,931,4.255681818181818
6355372,5,B00JDV69FM,"For forty years, Gaby has tended sheep on the farm that once belonged to his father. He is a loner, but not really what one would call lonesome: through the years, the farm, the sheep and indeed the land itself have become his best and constant companions. He has raised two daughters, both of whom have moved to pursue their lives in Montreal:Marie is married and raising a family, Frederique is pursuing an acting career. When Marie visits and asks for help because she is separating from her husband, Gaby responds in the only way he knows how: he must sell the farm to support his daughter. Thus begins the painful process of separating himself from all he has known and loved for the past forty years,
Gabriel Arcand is outstanding as Gaby. There may not be alot of dialog, but he manages to silently convey his deepest emotions as he does what he feels he must to help his daughter. Through visits from his daughters, we get a glimpse of his relatoonships with them and the ultimate outcome of who is the ""good daughter"" and who is the bad is ultimately surprising.
This is a slow moving film-or rather a film that takes it's time. There is not a wasted frame or a shot that doesn't add something to the story.
This film is a gem. I only wish I had seen it in a theater-some of the widescreen shots must have been amazing.
I have the Canadian DVD issue which includes no extras.",1406246400,4,1384,4.431372549019608
6355373,4,B00JDV69FM,"""The Auction"" (2013 release from Canada; 111 min.; original title ""Le dmantlement"" or ""The dismantling"") brings the story of Gaby, a 60-somethingh year old sheep farmer in the northern part of Quebec. Gaby has spent his whole life there, but is now alone, his brothers having left him, then his wife, then his 2 daughters Marie and Frederique, who chose the life in the big city (Montreal). Then one day, Marie and her 2 little boys visit Gaby. She tells him that she has left her husband Steve, and that she needs money to buy out Steve's half of the house. Gaby is determined to help her, but soon realizes he may need to sell his beloved farm to do so. Will Gaby sell the farm and dismantle his entire existence? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is essentially a movie about a farmer's life, and as such the movie moves at a snail's pace, and I mean that as a (high) compliment. The farm's environment is showcased time and again, to great effect. Second, Gabriel Arcand, in the role of Gaby, brings a towering performance that will leave you wowed at the end of the movie (he won the Canadian Oscar-equivalent for Best Actor, and much deserved at that). Third, kudos to writer-director Sebastien Pilote for bringing this story, he scored several nominations for this movie at the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars (but didn't win). Last but certainly not least, the movie has a fantastic soundtrack, composed by Serge Nakaushi-Pelletier. I am going to check if by chance the soundtrack is commercially available. Bottom line: ""The Dismantling"" (much better title than ""The Auction"") is an emotionally taxing movie that is worth the investment, time-wise, money-wise and emotion-wise.

This movie was the March, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and it will be released to the public at large in September, 2014. As usual, the DVD comes with a number of bonus materials, and also a nice animated shortie (""The Giant"", 2013 release from Spain; 11 min.), equally worth checking out. ""The Auction"" is another very worthy addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1397260800,5,2290,4.884318766066838

6355375,4,B00JDV69FM,"A great performance is rendered here by Gabriel Arcand as Gaby Gagnon, a 60ish sheep farmer, deeply committed to the farm his father left him, but more devoted to his 2 daughters. When Marie, who is divorcing and can't imagine uprooting her children to the farm, requests $200,000 euros of her dad to keep her house, he albeit absurdly, loyally concedes. He's going to sell it all. So while the viewer sulks and fumes, there's a lot to take in. The magnificent land with its roaming sheep, exquisite sunsets, changing seasons, Gaby at work, his emotions kept mostly under wraps-- all this captured in the fine cinematography of Michel La Veaux and editing (Stephane Lafleuur).  Sebastien Pilote is responsible for the competent screenplay and direction. One of the few displays of affect and personality by ascetic Gaby is the diverse music selections while he's in his pickup. The score is the result of the just-right work of Nakaushi-Pelletier. All the acting is solid.  The storyline is far from one-dimensional. There's another side to all this change in Gaby's life, and it may not be all bad.  You'll see.  Recommend.",1485648000,5,1124,4.931216931216931

6355382,5,B00JDV69FM,"Note: the detailed plot discussion that follows do not reveal any spoilers; the title of the movie tells you what's going to happen!

In ""The Auction"", director Sebastian Pilote presents us with Gaby Gagnon, the 62-year old sole proprietor of the the ""Gagnon & Sons"" farm, a sheep ranch in French-speaking Canada (Quebec?). The land is rolling and beautiful, but this very terrain limits its utility for any other agricultural purpose. Even though the farm's name includes ""& Sons"", Gaby's brothers long ago lost interest in the affairs of running the farm; it is Gaby's.

Gaby's two adult daughters have fled the farming life for the charms of life in Montreal. Youngest daughter Frederique is an aspiring actress, and apparently semi-estranged from both Gaby and his oldest daughter, Marie. Marie is about to separate from her investor husband when she arrives for a visit with her two sons. She confesses both the upcoming separation and the extent of her own family's debts to Gaby. Gaby agrees to help her while concealing his own marginal financial situation, and sets about the grim business of selling the farm in order to allow Marie to keep her kids in her own house.

Along the way he must deal with the sudden interest from his brothers in the proceeds of the sale, where his dog will go, the emotion that comes with separating himself from the accoutrement of two generations of things needed to run the farm, the confirmation of his ex-wife that she was right to leave him, and the reality that his world is about to shrink from the pastoral grandness of the vistas of his farm to the narrow confines of a government subsidized one-bedroom apartment. We also learn that Frederique may not be as distant and aloof when dealing with Gaby alone than she was presented when her lack of contact was analyzed by Gaby and Marie.

Is he happy about this? In his words: ""Fathers need to give to be happy. We're like that."" But the movie does not answer this question without ambiguity. It closes with images of Frederique and Marie, each apparently content in their familiar surroundings. We're given no such assurances that Gaby is equally sanguine.

""The Auction"" is an interesting story with stunning cinematography and engaging characters. Like all offerings from Film Movement, it is a wonderful break from the same old same old that Hollywood churns out.

6355383,3,B00JDV69FM,"This film was a little hard to stay with. Beautifully filmed, it lacked insight into Gaby, whether be was happy in the end or regretful. Maybe the smiles were supposed to convey that. I thought that his new apartment was dismal for a man who lived outdoors most of his life. Perhaps its more about settling into a life that you do not choose?",1417219200,,342,4.359375
8650091,5,B00JDV69FM,Excellent.  Full of emotion.  Genuine,1527897600,,37,6.2
8650092,5,B00JDV69FM,"The French title for this artistic but somber movie is LE D&Eacute;MANT&Egrave;LEMENT, which means THE DISMANTLING, which is very appropriate.  Everything falls apart for the protagonist, 63-year-old sheep farmer Gaby (Gabriel Arcand).

Sheep farming today is not a profitable profession.  It's a way of life that cuts one off from the urban, globalized world. It's a profession that is slowly dying out; those who persist barely make enough to earn a profit.

The focus of this movie is to show Gaby's love for his two daughters, Marie and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique.  He's divorced now and his daughters have moved to the big city with careers of their own.  Marie is the older one, who begs her father Gaby ( Gabriel Arcand) for $200,000 so that she can buy out her husband's part of the home in Montreal.  She has lived far beyond her means and doesn't want to give up that lifestyle. She is a selfish woman who knows how to manipulate her father, and he does everything for her.  This is disturbing to watch, as that means Gaby must give up everything he has:  the land, the farm, his dog, his home, everything that he inherited from his father.  He doesn't have much to live on in retirement.  Is he willing to sacrifice everything to keep his grandchildren safe in a home?  The film quickly becomes focused not so much on the parent-child relationship, but on the divide between urban and rural lifestyles, young versus old, materialism versus frugality.  It's about choices we must make.

The other daughter, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique, lives more frugally as a struggling theatre actress.  She and her sister don't talk much, but at least Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique shows concern for her father's welfare post sheep farm.  Both daughters live in the city but don't spend much time together.  The film focuses instead on Gaby, the farm, and the bucolic Quebecois countryside.  The plot is slow because it's character driven, and the characters develop quite well.

The acting is solid.  There are a few disturbing scenes involving animals that bothered me, but that is life on a sheep farm.",1495065600,2,2092,4.956896551724138
