8062011,5,B0009JN6XA,"I have been involved in the martial arts since 1969 and have black belts in Tang Soo Do, Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, Karate and I am a teacher of Shaolin Praying Mantis Kung Fu and Tai Chi.  My highest rank is 6th dan in Tang Soo Do.  As a Master level teacher and long time student of the martial arts, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for training drills.  However, you do not have to be a teacher to benefit from this DVD, as it is easy to follow and anyone could learn from it.  I have not seen the other DVDs by Master Johnson, however, I suspect they are great.
