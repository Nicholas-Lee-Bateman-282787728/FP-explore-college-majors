The best way to use the product is to watch a video, watch it again , then put it away, watch the next one , watch it again and put it away. Do not try to watch all at once. After four or five videos, go back to the first few to reinforce.

The video is of not much use if you do not have a good Coach. Understand if your coach is a leisure coach or a coach who is focused on competitive play. Competitive coach primarily focuses heavily on techniques ( Nick Bollieterini videos are heavily into techniques). How you hold the racket, How you move your feet, how you recover, How you hold the racket while serving etc. For newbies, go to some county level tennis tournaments to see how difficult it is to win at a county level, then Reassess your game.

The reason I said do not worry about the ""price"" is that these can be resold back in Amazon or Ebay at near full price.",1417910400,,938,4.059459459459459
