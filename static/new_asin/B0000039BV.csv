1178390,4,B0000039BV,I found the movie very interesting.  Movies never follow the book to a tee. The actors and actresses were superb.  I enjoyed each and every one of the characters(no problem with nicollette).  Jackie comes through once again. I recommend it. It leaves you yearning for more.,1080864000,7,273,4.891304347826087
1178391,4,B0000039BV,"A very nice movie,with a splendid cast (although there were some exeptions!).
The story itself is offcourse classic and appealing.
It provides some 4 hrs of intertainment witch may seem long,but the movie is surtanly worth the time.
An exiting tale with an impressing cast...
So all by all i would recomend it.. (too bad its not yet available on dvd!)
But why trust my opinion,watch the movie and decide for yourself..",1026691200,4,418,4.819444444444445
7902498,5,B0000039BV,"Jackie Collins' Lucky Chances was released as a mini series in 1990. A great over the top show of Las Vegas, Hollywood, and New York. Nicolette Sheridan stars as Lucky with great support from Grant Show and Stephanie Beacham. Fans of Jackie Collins novels will like this the most.",1521244800,,280,4.73469387755102
7902499,5,B0000039BV,This mini series was excellent. It spans over 40 years. The cast was perfect. Vincent Irizarry was amazing as Gino Santangelo. And Nicolette Sheridan was a surprising scene stealer as Lucky. The movie followed the book exactly which is very rare. I think more of Jackie Collins books should be made into movies. Let The Santangelo Saga continue on the small screen.,1482796800,,365,4.903225806451613

7902503,4,B0000039BV,"What a cast. But first of all Jackie writes great books. now Nicollette, Desperate Housewives, Vincent< David on AMC, yah, Eric Victor on Y&R, Phil Morris, good soap person. First I bought this movie because Vincent & Eric were in it. Second because Jackie wrote it. Now I know the movie is never as good as the book, that is a given, but I knew this cast would bring it through. thank you cast. I miss you Vincent.",1342742400,,415,4.333333333333333
7902504,4,B0000039BV,"I really enjoyed the book and the film.  Unfortunately it is not available on DVD here in the USA.  I purchased a VHS version, hoping to kick back and enjoy it.  Not.  The picture quality was bad, jumpy, unable to really watch it through.  I rewound it and am returning it. Regrets.  I loved all those mini-series. Scruples, The Manions of America, Rich Man, Poor Man, The Other Side of Midnight.......  Too bad they don't run them anymore.",1311897600,,440,4.564102564102564

7902506,5,B0000039BV,"This movie was so good and the acting was surperb.  The movie did the book justice.  The actor that played Gino (david from all my children) surprised me with his excellent acting abilities.  This was the kind of movie that you want to watch after you've finished cooking, washed the dinner dishes, took a shower and cut on your bedside lamp get in the bed and get lost in this movie.  I lent it to my mother.  I hope she likes it.",1255824000,,431,4.2073170731707314
