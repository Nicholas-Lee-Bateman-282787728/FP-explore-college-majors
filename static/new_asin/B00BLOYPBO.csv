5644663,4,B00BLOYPBO,"Featuring some very hot male actors, this zany gay romantic comedy retells the standard story found in such films in a winsome way, never getting too heavy in the process. It's lots of fun and heart-warming--just what you expect.",1417219200,2,229,4.897435897435898
5644664,2,B00BLOYPBO,"We were disappointed by this movie.  The main character is really not interesting or pleasant (the script makes him that way), and the actor is not really good for the role. He might have been better with a better script.  The most interesting person to watch was Joel Rush--he seemed extremely believable, and was beautiful to look at.  The ex-lover and the sister were enjoyable, as was the woman who gets involved with the ex, but none were quite believable. With a better script, the actors might have made a better showing. Another mediocre gay comedy.",1414454400,,557,4.78125

5644666,3,B00BLOYPBO,"That a main character could be almost totally self-obsessed is believable; that the same character could also be a successful, or even moderately successful, therapist is not.  This lazy disregard for or willful blindness to reality is the main problem with the script for this movie, resulting in plot events that range from the improbable to the ridiculous.  That being said, the script also has many funny lines and more than a few situations that are genuinely charming. The principal actors are skilled and all deserve praise for the effort they put into making this material seem better than it really is.  And speaking of acting, there is one extraordinary bit that, for me, makes the whole DVD worth just about any (reasonable) price you might pay for it:  the brilliant Michael Carbonara's brief comic scene as one of Corey's Grindr dates.  You might end up wanting to watch that one over and over again.",1410566400,2,913,4.864516129032258
5644667,3,B00BLOYPBO,"I finally saw this movie after it is now available for rent or purchase.  (After being delayed several months at a time; several times).

Other reviewers have given a plot summary, so I will rather do this review not by repeating, but by giving you and idea of what I thought worked and didn't work in this movie.

The main character Corey as a licensed therapist isn't really believable.  They got the wardrobe correct for the role, but he is too wishy washy and his patients have nonexistent issues that they could get better advice talking to a friend about.  Paying a therapist that much money for not even listening very well is a little far fetched.

The whole cliched theme we see often too much, is present in this movie - is he really gay (Pete)?  And once we get the confirmation of ""yes,"" Corey doubts himself. ...Too good to be true/how could a hot ripped guy like that be gay and truly like a non-Adonis bottom Corey?

Unrealistic also, is that Corey and Pete text through Grindr throughout the entire movie.  They did the dirty deed.  They have been dating.  You would think they'd have each other's personal cell phone numbers, rather than want to log into a hook up app that neither of them used to hook up with (before finding each other).  Or is this movie a big advertisement for Grindr?

The summary of this movie states that it is reminiscent of ""Eating Out.""  This is only because the actor that plays Pete and Kelsey were both in the more recent ""Eating Out"" series movies.  if you go into this movie thinking that ""Eating Out"" is what you're going to get, you might be let down.

At the end of the movie, I guess what I have a hard time with is finding the main character Corey as likable.  Likability is important to establish in order to get the audience to identify.  This movie doesn't successfully do that, I felt.  Why should Corey end up with  or deserve either musclebound hunky guy?",1407542400,8,1915,4.479768786127168
5644668,4,B00BLOYPBO,"Another gay rom-com and I have no problem with that at all. This is about Corey he has a good career as a psycho-analyst, his best friend and sister is a lesbian who is great fun and he has a very hot boyfriend. Then his boyfriend gets a relationship wobble and goes to a bar where he gets all squiffy and picks up a woman!

When he confesses to Corey about his indiscretion, Corey throws him out and amidst a glut of self pity decides to turn his life around and try to see if he can meet that `special someone'. Cue the humour - and to be fair there are quite a few comic moments to be seen here. The sister, Kelsey (Jennifer Elise Cox of `The Brady Bunch' movies) is a force of humorous nature. The supporting cast are all more than above par, but some of the jokes fall a bit flat or fall into that comedy clich mode - like an old woman supposedly being shocking because she talks about sex.

That aside this is quite a lot of fun; there is some nudity but all a bit tame in that department. It is really about relationships, love and doing the right thing - even if you get it wrong a few times first. Tyler Poelle as Corey -he was in `Scrubs' - is a great choice for the lead and his co star Joel Rush as Pete the pizza guy is spot on - he was in some of the `Eating Out' films. This is far from being original, will not enlighten you on any aspects of being gay or bi or whatever, but it is still a good watch.",1407110400,15,1417,3.968421052631579

5644676,1,B00BLOYPBO,This one was painful to watch.  The acting was so so.  The direction was uncertain as to playing scenes for comedy or drama and often achieved neither.

5644687,4,B00BLOYPBO,I enjoyed this movie.  It is a pleasant comedy and most of the characters are likable.  It doesn't really cover any new ground.  But is a great distraction on a rainy day or if you just want a few chuckles.  Worth watching.,1461801600,6,223,4.238095238095238

5644693,4,B00BLOYPBO,"I first reviewed this on DVD when it was released by TLA Releasing. Now its on a wonderful, beautiful blu-ray. This movie belongs on this new outlet, should be seen, and talked about. This is a great new product for this film.

This is a wonderful romantic comedy. A nice mix of wonderful acting, direction and over all love story of a relationship. The movie has a perfect chemistry of characters on screen. A fantastic film of love, relationships, and finding oneself. A passionate approach of film making. A memorable story. Memorable characters, and an awesome reality of love and companionship.

A great cast of actors and actresses performing brilliantly on screen by creating their characters in flawless ways. All the actors shine. Tyler Poelle is perfect as the character of Corey, who is dumped by his boyfriend for a girl. He is now somewhat lost and decides to set out to find himself, and ultimately falls again in love with Pete. Pete is played amazingly by Joel Rush, who might I add is stunningly sexy, and also perfect in the part. Many will know Tyler Poelle from the television series Scrubs. Poelle owns the character of Corey, and makes the viewer believe in the character, and the drama he is going through.

Joel Rush also creates the character flawlessly in a believable fashion which might I add I fell in love with. Both Poelle and Rush play off each others perfect acting, and create wonderful chemistry on screen. Joel Rush is known for the ongoing gay movie series, Eating Out, and also for the TV series If Loving You is Wrong.

Corey is a therapist whose ultimate joy is helping those who come to him, find a way of happiness in their lives. Now Corey has a sexy Jock boyfriend named Jon, played wonderful by David Wilson Page. Page is a great actor that creates Jon in perfection on screen. Now Jon has been a part of Coreys life for two years. Coreys lesbian sister and best friend Kelsey tells him he needs to pop the question.

Kelsey is played by the amazing actress Jennifer Elise Cox who many will remember as Jan Brady from the Brady Bunch movies. Cox has acted in many, upon many, TV and feature film roles, always adds a perfect flare to her characters, and Kelsey is no different. So after pushing from his sister, Corey wants to marry, and has all the courage to finally pop that ultimate question, will you marry me? What Corey doesnt know is Jon knows, and Jon decides to go out and party. Jon finds a woman and ends up sleeping with her. The attraction is more of need at the moment, and want then anything. Jon confesses to Corey. Jon leaves and now Corey is left hanging with a personal struggle. The shock is that, Jons mystery woman, is named Melissa, who happens to be one of Coreys clients. Corey does not let on that he knows, and so he continues to see the client to get all the facts, and info on the relationship. The character of Melissa is played top notch by a great actress who has acted for many years in TV and movie, Jenica Bergere.

So begins the story and Coreys journey to find love again. Some attempts are by horrible means and after a while, he finally finds a social dating network titled Grindr. There he meets Pete, a sexy poet Pizza boy. But as you can guess, Jon the Jock shows up again wanting back with Corey. Soon all the truth and lies come out in disastrous moments of comedy and drama. Soon Corey has to face the final showdown to make the right choice, or the struggle of making the choice he wants. Whatever he chooses those actions will change his life.

I think this film is directed perfect by Rosser Goodman, which this is her second feature film. Her first being Holding Trevor in 2007 which might I add, she also aced. Rosser Goodman did a great job at maintaining her actors and creating a perfectly flowing film for the viewer. This is written in a comical, drama induced plot by two wonderful writers, Dennis Bush and Cait Brennan. I think they aced the story and created something to remember.  This is Dennis Bushs first writing of a script. Brennan is an actress and has written scripts before. Bush and Brennan create a great story, and a character driven love affair of reality, which I think most people can relate to. This romantic drama stays with you long after its over.

Put out by KGB Films. Is a Canteen Outlaws release which is under TLA Releasing? I feel this is a film that leaves a lasting mark on the viewer. Captures the beauty of love, choices and struggle. I enjoyed the light heartiness at times, and also the struggle at times.

A perfect mix of comedy, romance and drama. The film comes together in a sexy, beautiful stunning way. A passionate love affair, romance, choices, secrets, relationships and the ultimate reality of setting in stone a personal future.

The script is clever, and the acting is solid. The lesbian sister is over the topalmost clownishbut nevertheless adds a certain flair to the movie. There is plenty of gay kissing, and enough gay sex to keep it interesting without bordering on porn. Be sure to watch the after the credits scene.
