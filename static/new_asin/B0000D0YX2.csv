7999776,3,B0000D0YX2,"This is an odd movie based on the theory of chaos. There are a couple of interesting characters and plot twists, but the love story between a Spanish student and his aunt comes across as a little creepy and the two actors have no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the movie takes place in depressing London locales also. If you are looking for something interesting and different, you might like this movie. If you are looking for an uplifting romantic comedy, look elsewhere.",1215475200,2,472,4.7682926829268295
