8683759,5,B00OIEQ3AU,"The music is great. Maddy Prior's voice is not what it was in the 1970s, but it's still beautiful. Although Steeleye Span has had lots of changes in personnel over the years, their sound - arrangements, instrumentation, etc. - still sounds the same. Great music skills and great songs.

A few words about the PAL format: I think Amazon should explain that. I certainly forgot that PAL means it won't play on most DVD players sold in the country. That should be stated up front in bold letters. Amazon notes the format is PAL but doesn't explain what that means.

I could play it on my Mac;  It's easy to feed the audio from the Mac to a good stereo using a cable, but the picture is still on the computer screen. With an Apple TV unit, I can stream the video and audio to a home theater, but that means buying a $100 Apple TV unit.

The DVD would not play on my Panasonic or Sony Blu-ray players. It would, however, play on my Oppo Blu-ray player. Nice, but not many people I know would be willing to pay for an Oppo Blu-ray player.

I don't know if Windows plays PAL DVDs, but I think before anyone buys this DVD, they figure out how they will play it.",1433548800,3,1153,4.2465753424657535

8683761,5,B00OIEQ3AU,"When I received this DVD I was surprised to find that, being a British DVD, it was coded  for PAL. That is a British system and is generally incompatible with DVD players sold in the U.S.A. Needless to say, It wouldn't play on my DVD player. After fooling around I found that it would play on my computer and, after more playing around I found a way to play it on my computer but watch it on my TV. This not a completely satisfactory solution but fortunately it works because this is a great DVD. The program is comprised of some old standbys and some new, at least to me, songs.
The group has aged well and all the songs are thoroughly enjoyable. Maddy Prior's voice is as great as ever.
I highly recommend this DVD but suggest that, before you but it, you make sure that you can play it.  I'm not sure that it should be sold in the U.S.A.",1427155200,4,840,4.179012345679013
8683762,5,B00OIEQ3AU,"There is good and bad here.  The music and performance are wonderful.  One would not expect anything else.

However, the website originally indicated the DVD was NTSC (playable in North America) but the two copies I received were each PAL (not playable on North American DVD players).  The description has now been changed to PAL.  It is not prominently displayed so be careful if you buy this excellent DVD.",1425254400,11,408,4.855072463768116
8683763,5,B00OIEQ3AU,Spectacular! A combination of songs from the must-have Wintersmith album and a variety of Steeleye Span classics. A delight and a great joy for any fan of Steeleye Span and Terry Pratchett.,1424390400,3,189,4.9375
