6937461,5,B00RZHDE04,"The J Veils band was the best live show I have ever attended.. I saw them 13 times. The most memorable was the tenth year anniversary at the Orpheum in Boston..They sprayed ten bottles oif champagne on the front row crowd. Faye Runaway danced with peter wolf.. Let's see that on DVD too. Buy this and relive some excitement ,and if you never seen them this is your chance to see and hear magic",1426032000,2,393,4.324324324324325
6937462,3,B00RZHDE04,"The best concert I ever saw was the J. Geil's Band with the Eagles in 1973.  J. Geil's blew the Eagles off the stage.  When DVD's came out I looked in vain for J. Geil's.  Finally, we get a DVD concert.  Sadly, it's not the same band I saw.  The music seemed to bounce off player after player when I saw them live.  This DVD has moments, but it's not the band at its best.  Perhaps in time as I listen to the Cd in my car, and become more familiar with the newer songs, I'll like it more than today.  But today, first time I heard it, and saw it, I got bored, fast.  I pray that somewhere a better concert somehow is found and made available.",1425686400,2,642,3.953125

6937464,5,B00RZHDE04,"This is the best live video that I have seen in a long time. All of the other reviews sum up the content. What this long awaited release does is confirm that J Geils Band is one of the best rock n roll show bands in the history of the art form. The fact that these players are still not in the RNRHOF is a crime! This set showcases them in their prime. Next best thing to being there.  If you are a music fan, this is the the only purchase you need this year~!",1425340800,12,460,3.8421052631578947
6937465,5,B00RZHDE04,"It's great to finally have a J. Geils Band  concert during their heyday on DVD. Such a high-energy show, it's unfortunate that the mix is quite muddy although the CD is a little better. One of the best rock and roll bands with what I feel is the tightest rhythm section ever, this is a good example of why they only played for about 75 minutes. I got to see them at the Inglewood Forum in 1974 and the San Bernardino Swing in 1975. I remember looking all around the Forum during the encores and everyone from the floor all the way up to the rafter seats were on their feet just going nuts. Such a powerful moment and still a vivid memory 40 years later. That's what rock and roll is all about. Thank you J. Geils Band.",1425254400,2,718,4.16546762589928
6937466,5,B00RZHDE04,THE BEST LIVE BAND EVER! I hope they have some more concert DVD's  coming out This concert brought back SOOO many wonderful memories for me when I saw them in concert in the 70's and early 1981. My favorite band of all time. I go back 43 years with them and they are still JUST PLAIN AWESOME!,1425254400,12,292,4.12280701754386
6937467,4,B00RZHDE04,I hope this is just the beginning of many more J Geils Band DVDs.  For being 36 years old it showcases this American Icon band very well.  I would have given it five stars if it had a better recording.  While it is adequate it just lacks bass and seems compressed on my system.  On the great side is the band.  WOW definition high energy and a great show.  This is a fun DVD\CD combo.,1424995200,24,384,4.053333333333334
6937468,5,B00RZHDE04,"After 36 years finally an official release. It's worth the wait. The Bad Boys from Boston in top shape. A journalist once wrote about their music: they have their ankles in the blues, their hips in the rock and roll, their hearts in the rhythm and blues and their heads towards the soul (hope the translation is correct...) Together with the Allman Brothers and Little Feat the best rockmusic of the seventies. I hope this is the start of the opening of the Geils vaults; extended versions of Full House, Blow Your Face Out, the Boston concert wich was broadcasted on tv in 1979, the show at Great Gildersleeves in New York in 1980 and so on. Peter! Please, please, please!!",1424995200,18,674,4.578512396694215
6937469,5,B00RZHDE04,"Finally. I have had a very old VHS copy of this show for quite some time and have been waiting to see it commercially released. They have done a great job of cleaning up the video. No, it's not Blu-ray, but pretty damn good. And the sound? How about 5.1 DTS digital? You betcha! Peter Wolf sounds clear and crisp. Wow. This is your chance to see one of the greatest live bands of all time IN THEIR PRIME. Watch as Peter bounces from one side of the stage to the other, whipping the crowd into a frenzy. One of the greatest front men ever, doing what he does best. And it includes a companion audio CD to boot. Ooooh yeahhhh! Let 'em hear ya baby! This is what a J.Geils party is all about! Enjoy....",1424908800,43,699,4.147058823529412

6937480,3,B00RZHDE04,"Cd has great live songs. I saw the J. Geils band back in the day and they were the most dynamic show band touring. The video picture quality is horrible. Good God, with the tech available you'd think they could have cleaned it some. Still a pleasure to see Peter Wolf's wild dancing and soul shouting, Magic Dick blowing his face out, Seth Justman's hands are a blur he's so damn fast on keys. Stephen Bladds' drumming is there but lost in the mix. All in all I still enjoyed the package, just a great damn band.",1449705600,2,512,4.288659793814433

The video quality is very good, not great, but the band is in top form so it's a lot of fun to watch. It's not a long show - clocking in at a little over an hour.

As with most of the Rockpalast releases, this is good recording, both picture and sound are first rate.  This DVD shows in the early 1980's (I think) and they were a wild live act and would be tough to beat on a good day.",1438214400,2,334,4.370967741935484

6937502,5,B00RZHDE04,"This is not nearly enough of a great thing:  The dvd only runs about 67 minutes, but conveys the energy of this band in their prime, just before the big hits came during their EMI era.  The performance is completely raucous and kinetic - these guys are pretty tight - and as there's not a huge amount of commercially available footage of the Geils Band available (not sure if the video for Showtime! was ever released, even on VHS?), this will have to do, but it leaves you wanting more.  There are a few technical glitches (some synch issues) but the picture is surprisingly clear/crisp, especiallly given that this was early videotape and the lighting on stage was frequently dark.  The package includes a cd of the audio too, so there's bang for your buck here.  Highly recommended - there's some choice stuff in the Rockpalast series worth checking out: Ian Hunter, Graham Parker, Roger McGuinn, etc.",1434326400,6,904,4.732484076433121
6937503,5,B00RZHDE04,A glance at J Geils Band at their heights in the late 70's right before Freeze Frame. For Geils fans this tour is supporting the  Sanctuary album and is  a reflection of the band at their best. I felt I was back in time and remembering what made J Geils so special.,1433289600,2,265,4.076923076923077
6937504,5,B00RZHDE04,"This DVD catches the band in their absolute prime before the Love Stinks, and Freeze Frame stuff. The band is tight and Pete Wolf's on stage energy infects the crowd to the point that no chairs are needed, as it is with all of the J.Geils shows I've attended. Only complaint is it is only a little more than an hour long and their sets were always closer to 2 hours.",1431907200,2,366,4.169014084507042

6937507,5,B00RZHDE04,Finally a live DVD.  I've seen this band multiple times and this dvd allows me to relive those days anytime.  Great value for the money,1430006400,,135,4.36
6937508,5,B00RZHDE04,I've been waiting for something from J Giels Band to come out other then the Bootleg version of this and some other shows. Very good show-audio DTS and Video for the time it was recorded. These guys know how to put on a show A+.,1429920000,,228,4.088888888888889
6937509,5,B00RZHDE04,A very underrated band.  And terrific in concert; right up there with the best like the Stones.  The video has been improved significantly from an old bootleg I saw of this show.  Nice job.,1429747200,,189,4.5
6937510,5,B00RZHDE04,Loved it,1429401600,,8,3.5
6937511,5,B00RZHDE04,"I was fortunate enough to see the J. Geils Band twice in their heyday (1970's), and anyone who knew anything about Rock Concerts knew that they were beyond a doubt the best band to go see live. I thought those glory days were just memories - so imagine my surprise when this popped up on my Amazon Recommendations page! I purchased it immediately. This is a miracle! It's like you are up on stage with them! I could go on and on, but those in the know don't need any further persuasion; those not in the know - buy this now!

6937515,5,B00RZHDE04,"THE J. GEILS BAND-HOUSE PARTY/LIVE IN GERMANY: Boston's soul-searing sextet THE J. GEILS BAND forged their reputation on loud, sweaty, highly charged live performances...during their seventies hey day, no one dared follow 'em on stage. In spite of iconic party-hearty in person platters like BLOW YOUR FACE OUT and FULL HOUSE, decent concert footage was unavailable for decades, but this hour long Rockpalast blast remedies that situation in spades. Howlin' PETER WOLF, arguably rock & roll's hardest working front man, channels everyone from MICK JAGGER to JACKIE WILSON, a whirling, prancing hyperkinetic powder keg of gritty blue eyed soul power born to belt funk-fueled RNB. MAGIC DICK, a leather-clad, modern day LITTLE WALTER is another visual secret weapon, laying down paint peeling harp solos while J. GEILS unloads lean 'n mean six string salvos devoid of ""guitar god"" pretentiousness. The crowd-pleasing set list ponies up a sanctified mix of oldies (HOUSE PARTY, GIVE IT TO ME, monster MOTOWN covers FIRST I LOOK AT THE PURSE and WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO) and slam-bang slabs (JUST CAN'T STOP ME, ONE LAST KISS and atypical ballad TERESA) off the band's then current album SANCTUARY. HOUSE PARTY/LIVE IN GERMANY is the next best thing to actually experiencing GEILS in person...and take it from a fan who's been there...it just don't git no better than that!

Geils Band live was as good as any live show that I saw, going back to the first time I saw them in 1972 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.  Considering the age of the performance the video is okay.  The audio is better.  As stated on the ""Blow Your Face Out"" LP/disc, ""Made Loud to be Played Loud.""

6937519,5,B00RZHDE04,"I have been waiting years for an official J. Geils Band concert DVD and this does not disappoint.  In fact it is a vivid reminder of what a powerhouse live rock band (then and still, America's best in my opinion) they were.  I remember taking a girlfriend to see them at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1973 during the Bloodshot tour (The Eagles opened for them).  She didn't even know who they were but by the end of their set she was screaming as loud as anyone else.  To this day she says it was the greatest concert she ever saw.  What I really appreciate about this is the reminder that shows back then were about the music...no flash bombs, fireworks, lasers or other distractions.  Just six passionate musicians rockin' the house and blowing our faces out!  I hope there is more in the vault.  By the way I saw Peter Wolf solo at a club in Santa Barbara a couple of years ago and he still moves well.  One of the greatest front men ever.",1426032000,2,949,4.31638418079096
