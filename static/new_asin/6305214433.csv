7885236,4,6305214433,"I used this DVD to prepare for the CLEP Calculus exam and I passes by a very small margin (that is not a complaint at all). Along with part I, this DVD covered most of the relevant topics but to pass the CLEP they aren't quite enough. The standard deviants do not cover implicit derivatives or trigonimic derivatives and could use some more complicated examples for integration.

  Having said that, these DVD's do provide a sound foundation and are easily understandable. The presentation is a little childish but, as I said, I needed them to prepare for the CLEP and, with few other resources, I did.",1107907200,2,602,4.660377358490566
