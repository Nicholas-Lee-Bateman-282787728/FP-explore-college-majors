5114146,5,B007XJ5DQ2,"A movie to bring out the kid in you!

Shot on film, Dear God No has the greasy feel of the great drive-in exploitation films of the 70s. It includes everything that made these scummy opuses so great, upping the cheap thrills ante to include more blood, more b**bs and more bizarreness than a daisy chain of Herschell Gordon Lewis, Dave Friedman and Andy Milligan could ever dream of. But Dear God No is hardly an artsy homage to 70s exploitation. It's the real thing, more extreme, more twisted, sicker, funnier and crazier than nearly anything that's ever b! tch-slapped the silver screen before. Unlike a lot of 70s grindhouse fare, though, Dear God No never has time to be boring or get stale. Long biker montage scenes are creatively shot so they never devolve into the kind of tired filler that Corman biker epics were known for. A seemingly endless scene with topless dancers in Nixon masks is still too short for my money. The characters are so sleazily charismatic that you never get tired of any of them, and deliver some of the most politically incorrect dialogue you'll ever hear. And the girls are all gorgeous, so what do you want from life?  Dear God No is the farthest thing from slick modern ""horror"" films you'll find. It's a PBR-soaked, sweat-stained experience that makes special effects spectaculars like Saw seem like an episode of Mr. Bean. Viewing it would feel like a violation if you weren't having so much fun. So take a road trip with the Impalers! Burn down the drive-in. Drink a mat shot. And shake hands with Bigfoot. It's more fun than a Hell's Angel initiation ceremony, and ten times as bloody.",1339459200,22,1627,4.665505226480836
5114147,5,B007XJ5DQ2,"This flick is an absolute blast.  When you see a biker step over an empty PBR box to kick a dead nun into the bushes within the first two minutes, I'd say it's safe to say that you're in for a wild ride. Another reviewer accused this flick of 'bad taste.""  You say that like it's a bad thing.  Dear God No flaunts its tasteless, violent, psychotic, bizarre excesses in the face of modern politically correct cinema.  I'll try not to give anything away, but we get the repeated dead nun crotch punting, multiple decapitations, lesbian incest rape, Nazis, tampon shots, children being murdered, coke-line swastikas, and anything else you can imagine. If depraved weirdness and blood-soaked mayhem is your thing, prepare to experience cinematic nirvana.  This isn't faux grindhouse filmmaking, this IS grindhouse filmmaking.  Shot on film, the way the cinema gods intended.  Get some buddies together, let the beer flow, and have a raucous good time watching this DVD.  will you ever have more fun watching a flick?  I say DEAR GOD NO!  All hail the Impalers.",1337472000,54,1056,4.849162011173185
5114148,1,B007XJ5DQ2,"I purchased this DVD as a pre-release at Texas Frightmare Weekend. As someone who appreciates (good) horror movies, as well as (even cheesy) Bigfoot flicks, I can honestly say this was the worst Bigfoot movie, no make that any movie I have ever seen. From the opening (and seemingly endless) montage of the biker gang riding down the road, to the brutal rape and murder of a pregnant woman, by stabbing her in the belly and then cutting her open to remove the fetus, this was the worst acting, if you can call it that, I have ever seen. I was expecting a grindhouse style Bigfoot flick. It is advertised as ""Bikers, Bullets, Boobs, Blood, Beer & Bigfoot"". They left a few B's out. Bad Taste being the most obvious.",1336953600,7,714,4.5

I truly feel scammed for paying for this cr@p! from the reviews I thought it would be in the same vein as movies like Death Proof, Planet Terror, and Machete but man was I wrong! believe me, the only cool thing about this movie is the dvd cover. if you want a true grindhouse style biker flick get Hell Ride, I highly recommend it! it's the real deal, unlike this pathetic piece of garbage.",1444435200,2,576,4.293577981651376

So your source material has bad acting, bad pacing, crappy special effects...so basically you can do as half-assed a job as you want and you're just being true to the source material, right? I guess... so they managed to make a new version of those flicks that's actually less watchable than the originals. Really bad acting. Really bad pacing. Incomprehensible plot. Congratulations, guys, you made a movie that makes Troma look like Merchant Ivory.

If you're gonna do something like this, you've got to have at least a bit of wit, some spark of cleverness to go along with the schlock. This one's gleefully, purposefully stupid, and it really grates after the first half hour.",1426377600,2,745,4.96

One reviewer said that Christians would be offended by this movie.  I think most people would be offended by this movie!  This movie is only for people who like movies that most people would be offended by.

As a consequence of this movie being humorous in nature, the deaths at the hands of the bikers are over quick, for the most part.  Most of the blood was due to gunshot wounds (and a few beheadings), which there were plenty of, and all nicely squibbed.",1400544000,2,681,4.487804878048781

5114171,3,B007XJ5DQ2,"There is some good explotation here, and an overall good 70's vibe to the theme. The plot is okay at best though as it is kind of a genre mashup between a biker flick, hippies, scientific experimentation, satanic rituals, bigfoot, and a very loosely tied in Nazi theme(?) It is sure to please gore hounds and while explotation lovers will not turn this one off, its still a bit lacking in my opinion. At times it just comes across as a shock film as the humor is few and far between here. Of particular note on this issue is the two bikers who are always trying to out-do each other to be crowned the nastiest or foulest biker there is. It seems like those moments were added purely for shock and not for any other redeeming value.

The nudity in here is gratuitous as well - at times it even goes overboard (I didn't think that was possible!) But there are one or two scenes of topless dancers that literally last an entire song (3-4 minutes). I was happily viewing at first but I found that it was like a giant intermission and eventually found myself wanting to get back to the movie, especially during the second scene. A side note on the songs though is that they were actually pretty good for a low budget film. I forget who did all the music but it was not bad at all.

At the end of the day, I don't regret renting this movie at all. It was a decent way to pass 90 minutes or so. But I am glad that I didn't buy it as I doubt it will get any future viewings out of me. It is along the same vein as many of the TROMA exploitation films but it lacks the humor and overall cheesy attraction. I see this compared to ""Father's Day"" a lot and while it is not a horrible comparison, ""Father's Day"" is far superior in my opinion.",1394755200,,1729,4.173652694610778

5114173,1,B007XJ5DQ2,"Trailer looks good but movie is just plain stupid. I am a big fan of low budget, gory movies but thd lack of just one decent character and the complete lack of a plot make this movie  one hour and fourteen minutes of crap that keeps you wanting to fast forward to a good part that sadly never comes. It's like the makers of this film made the trailer first and then tried to make the movie around the trailer but failed miserably. The worst Troma film is leaps and bounds better than this wannabe garbage. Anyone looking for a movie with more action, plot, politically incorrectless, T&A,  gore, and humor need look no further than Poultrygeist!

IF YOU DON'T LIKE/ENJOY TOTALLY CRUDE, RUDE AND LEWD  AND OTHER GRAPHIC DISPLAYS OF THE LOWEST FORMS OF HUMAN DEPRAVITY COMIC OR OTHERWISE PLEASE...PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. Now let me tell you about the movie from my perspective. I an not going to give any details of the story away, but rather give you a brief overview. I don't watch this genre very often unless I think it might be good (we all know thats not very often) and with some much needed new material for the genre. The old and worn out material with the burping, passing gas, naked girls, drunkard's and stoners in their late teens to early twenties throwing the party of the century type of movies. In this movie they do break some new ground by mixing 70's biker grindhouse genre and with their brand of farfetched  and grossed out humor and it worked for me in the first third of the movie, but after the second third it was getting old and wearing on my patience and by the last third I was thinking this just can't end soon enough, I had some good laughs in the first part and couldn't wait for more. What happened? I thought they were trying to pull the old ""lets see who is the grossest"" or see who will gets sick first. prank and for me it was that going astray that ruined the last two thirds of what started out as a grossed out funny movie. The movie does have plenty of the standard 70's biker material like ""gas, grass or a@@"" nobody rides for free and large helpings of twisted, gross, nudity, sex, perversions, gun play, knife play, foul language and violence in a black comedy. Was this worth the time? Sort of? Would I watch again? No. Maybe if I drank or used drugs the whole movie might have been funny with the first third falling out of my chair funny. Since I don't drink or do drugs other than Dr. prescribed I will never know. Darn it!!! 2 Stars

Rating 0 to 5 Stars

Story = 3 to 0  Starts out grossly funny, but falls sharply after 30 minutes (give or take).
Acting = 1 to 2  The acting is pretty bad intentionally or not with zero standouts.
Direction = 3  Director is no target for the first part of the movie, but looses focus soon after.
Fear/Creep Factor = 3  Has some good cheesy creepiness to it.
Gore = 3.6  Numerous silly and cheesy gore effects.
Sex/Nudity = Plenty/ Plenty of topless scenes too.
Foul Language = Everything under the sun and then some.
Entertainment Value = 2 The laughs and funny scenes kept gettingt farther and farther apart as the movie progressed.",1377388800,4,2522,4.371794871794871

Have you ever wondered what would happen if Krug from Last House on the Left decided he wanted to start a biker gang, and then sieged upon the house of a now nazied up Roger Patterson?  Me too.  Thankfully the cast and crew of this sleaze fest thought it high time to answer this plaguing question.

Dear God No! follows Jett and his biker gang, the Impalers, on a booze-filled, mostly Pabst Blue Ribbon(something tells me that weren't exactly looking for product placement), and tampon-filled, romp accompanied with rape, murder, and excessive drug use, and more rape and murder.  After a quick bit of patricide, the rapscallions seek out the whereabouts of a couple who made the mistake of crossing their path.  But the gang is in for something much more than an impromtu cesarean as a creature waits patiently, well not so much patiently, this movie won't exactly be known for its slow-burning atmosphere.

This movie had me tingling like a little twihard salivating for the pasty skin of a metrosexual glittery vampire.  It had it all.  Nazis, dead nuns, cheesy dialogue, children being killed, (again)murder and rape, bigfoot, and topless hotties donning Richard Nixon masks.  Why would a topless chick wear a Nixon mask, you ask?  Why wouldn't they wear a Nixon mask?  In fact, because of this movie any unfortunate woman crazy enough to end up with me will undoubtedly be exclaiming with passion the phrase ""I am not a crook!"".  I almost forgot to mention the mother-daughter incest.  Yeah! Now I got your attention!  Man, if my mom was that hot I'd went dw....wait no I wouldn't.  Mom, please stop reading this.

In all honesty, when I first heard of this movie I wrote it off as just another insipid Grindhouse inspired dv dreck, masked with an excessive amount of old film filters.  Upon learning that it was actually shot on 16mm I had to recant my thoughts and check out the trailer.  That's all it took.  If you have an affinity for exploitation, flat out sleaze from the 70s, and the most politically incorrect humor, then this beautiful beast is for you, a sickening concoction of the different flicks you could find from this era neatly wrapped up in 80 minutes of pure debauchery.  In short, would I recommend it?  NO!  I require it!!  And if you refuse, well you've read the review so that would make you a witness, and we all know what happens to a witness.",1351641600,10,2459,4.678321678321678
5114202,5,B007XJ5DQ2,"My name is Lucio. I'm a 2 year old boy. I have the hairiest chest and back out of everyone I know...including my Italian father. About 3 weeks ago I had to get a transfusion. No, not for different blood, but for BEER! My little body has rejected my blood, and other blood transfusion attempts, and now I have good ole American PBR running through my veins. You might be asking yourself, ""What does this have to do with 'Dear God No!'?""...It has everything to do with this movie.

I was just a normal toddler not long ago. Enjoying the likes of cereal as a snack, Yo Gabba Gabba on the tv, and going to the bathroom in my pants. Then, one day, my dad (who's account I'm using to write this) got a package in the mail. Upon inspection of the package, dad was stoked to find out that he had gotten none other than the new exploitation classic, ""Dear God No!"" He popped the disc thinking I was napping on the couch. What I witnessed, changed me completely. Sasquatch, naked ladies, beer consumption, mad scientists, nazis, naked ladies in rubber presidential masks...INSANITY on film!

After watching the film seveal times, I noticed my chest and back were growing hair at alarming rates. I had to get that transfusion I was talking about earlier, I no longer have the yearning for cereal as a snack, it's now beef jerky. I watch Russ Meyer flicks instead of Yo Gabba Gabba and I look like one of the Werewolves on Wheels from all this hair, it's crazy. My parents still don't know I can now talk, let alone type.

This film has made me a 2 year old MAN...with a micro brewery in my diaper. I heard my dad talking with his friends on how ""Hell Ride"" wishes it was like this. I saw ""Hell Ride"" once, and I gotta say, pops is 100% correct. So, if you're looking for a great exploitation flick, new biker flick... or something that makes you turn into the American man you were meant to be...This is that flick!",1351555200,4,1904,4.372881355932203

5114206,5,B007XJ5DQ2,"Someone brought this disc along to our last church retreat, telling me that it was a lighthearted family comedy starring Greg Kinnear. We loaded it up, and only watched 10 minutes before the entire church group erupted in the kind of depraved orgy of sex and violence that could only be dreamed up by the Marquis de Sade or Kevin James (seriously, look into the behind-the-scenes stories of what went on during King Of Queens).

We've all since abandoned our religious ways, formed a biker gang, and travel the back roads of this country taking what we want from who we want. This movie has inspired us all, and instead of preaching the word of god, we now preach the word of Jett, hoping that we'll eventually have enough followers to start up a compound in Death Valley and lead our army of dune buggy warriors as we rise up against the pigs.

The DVD is bolstered by a great transfer, sound mix and extras, and the cover art by The Dude Designs is a thing of beauty. Five stars!",1350518400,4,981,4.444444444444445

She was about 60 and had three nipples but it still counts, right? I can still hear the sound of Conway Twitty's voice on her old record player. No sir, no more late nights of Showtime and a fleshlight for me. This movie bring strong power with it and everyone should own it and feel some of that power.

5114214,2,B007XJ5DQ2,"before i start, i let me just say that i am a big fan of bad movies.  and while this is truly a bad movie, i think it fell far short of its potential.

a quick synopsis of the plot:  a gang of murdering and raping bikers encounters a nazi anthropologist performing genetic experiments with a virus found in sasquatch blood.  while it sounds like a movie with great potential, i found much of the plot transitions to be weak, even by bad movie standards.  while there are many good one-liners, too much of the film is spent focusing on bad stripper sequences (at one point when i presented this movie to a group of friends, one of them made the comment ""i didn't believe it was possible, but i'm actually bored with boobs now."")  i myself kept looking for track marks on the arms of some of the actresses, who appeared bored in their performances.  sasquatch does make an appearance, but it is late in the film and is only to mercifully kill everyone involved.

don't get me wrong, parts of this movie were fun (such as the interaction between the gang and their father), but what little there was was not enough to carry the film as a whole.  the premise of the film promises a great deal of schlock and bad movie greatness, but it forgot the greatness and instead focused on breasts to such a degree that the film became very adolescent to me.

summary:
the pros:  some good one liners, good premise
the cons:  too much time wasted on strippers and not enough on anything important to the movie, unimpressive and bored performances from many of the cast, weak plot.

as a side note, note that many of the actors playing the impalers also fill many of the backstage roles, such as ""key grip"" and such.  maybe the film would have been better if the same five individuals didn't try to do absolutely everything in the film and instead worked on writing and editing.",1345420800,3,1863,4.457227138643068

If you dig exploitation films of the late 60's, 70's and 80's you WILL enjoy this! Cheesy acting, editing, nudity, blood, REAL FX that were made lovingly this film has it all. A homage and salute to multiple genres; Dear God NO! covers the Biker, Drug, Horror, Bigfoot, Sci-Fi, Woods, over the top camp films like no other! Hobo With A Shotgun did it well, Father's Day too, but for me, Dear God NO! is the best of all of them. This film makes me laugh out loud and I have watched it a bunch of times already. Dear God NO! is going right next to Last House On The Left, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pink Flamingos, Cannibal Holocaust, and all the great Biker films I own. It is THAT DAMN GOOD! Remember these are just my opinions and if you are a whiny b**ch who does not like REAL NON-HOLLYWOOD films and prefers the latest Lars Von Tier film, maybe this isn't for you.

Most of the time, I end up being mildly or tremendously disappointed. Dear God No is almost perfect. The excessive gore prevents it from being an instant classic in my eyes. Everything else is great. The bad acting, sound drops, generic 70's soundtrack, hairstyles, vehicles, tattoo-free nudity and jam-packed plot all scream grindhouse but I got sick of seeing blood soaked guts towards the end. I won't give away too much but things really get gross once The Impalers reach the would be safehouse. I remember some gore back in the 70's but one particular scene would make Jigsaw, Freddy, Jason and Pinhead all turn away. So, Dear God No is loads of fun overall and I'm glad that I purchased it. Hopefully, the already in production sequel won't be as nasty. Rape-happy gorehounds should love the first film and the buzz is positive for the most part.
