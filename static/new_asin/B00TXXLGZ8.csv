8703289,5,B00TXXLGZ8,"The Sphere is a visual masterpiece that took months to create. It's a short film that takes you through space in a dramatic adventure that nearly ends humanity. When a three-dimensional digital creation comes to life, the sphere falls to earth with mind-blowing speed, and the anti-gravity emitter is created in a flash to handle the potential destruction. This is a must see short film as all the visual effects were created in an at home studio and would typically cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Pretty cool!",1443052800,,518,4.8977272727272725
