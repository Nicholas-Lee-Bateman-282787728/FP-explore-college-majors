8200991,5,B000RJ6UTY,"Don't get ripped off, this full Raw homecoming show is part of the Raw 20th Anniversary collection for much cheaper!  You can buy the Raw 20th anniversary DVD (just released) and get this show and 19 other full episodes of Raw.  Please don't fall victim to people who are charging such an absurd amount for a used DVD.  Buy the Raw 20th anniversary collection brand new, save money and get 20x the content.",1386028800,4,406,4.534246575342466
8200992,4,B000RJ6UTY,"Let me begin by saying that it is truly honor to be the first to review this release here on Amazon.com (or could it be that it was not worth reviewing so everyone else just left it alone?). As a fan or collector, it seems natural to want to have this release in one's collection. But the hefty price tag it carries makes it highly unlikely for many to place this one on their shelf. I was fortunate to find it at a reasonable(?) price of $55. As I viewed this dvd I kept this price tag on my mind, hoping I had not made a mistake. The premise behind this presentation was the return of WWE Raw to the USA network (after having spent some years on the TNN/Spike network). For the dent this purchase put in my wallet, I found that I enjoyed it as it was evident WWE was trying to give this presentation as much of a PPV feel as possible. And that they did: Piper's Pit w/ Mick Foley- 30 minute Iron Man: Angle v. HBK- Austin & the Mcmahons- Loser leaves Raw MIB Ladder match: Edge v. M. Hardy- Carlito & Masters v. HHH & Flair- Honoring the Legends- Bra & Panties: T. Wilson, C. Michelle & Victoria v. T. Stratus & Ashley- Mysterio, Benoit & Batista v. JBL, Christian & E. Guerrero- Mean Gene & Hulk Hogan- WWE Championship: Cena v. Bischoff. I very much enjoyed the legends' reunion.  I believe the Iron match between Michaels & Angle was great (second only to Lesnar vs. Angle from Smackdown!) The real highlight for me was the Hulk Hogan interview. It was very brief but did it's job as a exciting cliffhanger (a challenge to Stone Cold). Overall,  this rare DVD proved to be solid. But that's the opinion of a guy who paid $55 for it.  Bottom line: If you can find it at an affordable price, give it try as it's very entertaining. Any more money than what I spent, well, that's between you and the landlord.",1354838400,,1810,4.255813953488372
