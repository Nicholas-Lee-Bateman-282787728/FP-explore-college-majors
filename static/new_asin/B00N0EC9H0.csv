8675506,1,B00N0EC9H0,I need to send this program back to you it'is not even in Englis,1446768000,,64,3.642857142857143
8675507,2,B00N0EC9H0,"Other reviewers indicated that this was a 3-DVD set with 1 Audio CD.  That was the basis of my purchasing this.  $90 for a single DVD of 25 episodes is not a very good deal, especially with the lower quality video required to fit all the data.  Having watched this on Netflix, I loved it.  Amazing story, detailed, realistic characters with conflicting emotions, fun and exciting twists and in all of that some good messages about truth to oneself.

Overall, I give the Anime 5 stars, but this media I give only 1 star, and the lack of consistency in what is being sold, I give 1 star.  Averaged, I give this product 2 stars.",1433376000,,625,4.391304347826087
8675508,5,B00N0EC9H0,Just what I expected. Clearly lists that the series has english subs and that the entire box has japanese characters on it so I would assume thats what the dubbing would be in.  Box looks fantastic and there is always some poor changes in anime when they go from japanese to english. Well done and I was glad I can snag the complete series for a decent price rather than 40-60 for each english ARC.,1421193600,,398,4.306666666666667
8675509,4,B00N0EC9H0,"The product has no Bonus anime DVD instead the bonus disk is the full soundtrack to this anime. It is english subtitled, along with the other two listed subtitles with Japanese/cantonese/mandarin spoken. It is a 4 disk set. 3 for the anime first 9 episodes on the first next 8 on the second and last 8 on the third disk, and the fourth disk is the bonus soundtrack. On the last anime disk after after episodes 21 there was a short little trivia question game show with the anime characters in it. This however was not subtitled. I still consider this a good buy if you want to get the full anime on dvd.

With the miss leading title I believed the bonus DVD was the SAO extra edition movie. Sadly it is not the movie let alone a bonus DVD, as said before it is the full soundtrack to the anime.",1420934400,,794,4.223684210526316
8675510,5,B00N0EC9H0,"As the previous reviewer mentioned in his or her review from December 5, 2014, there is no English dubbed audio track in this DVD set.  That is exactly what I was looking for, so I'm quite happy.  I wanted Japanese audio with English subtitles.  It's also nice to be able to buy all 25 episodes together at once, rather than split into four separate pieces.

If you're curious, the available audio tracks are Japanese, Cantonese, and Mandarin.  Subtitle options are Chinese, English, and Malay.  The set contains three DVDs with the episodes on them, plus one CD with 15 songs on it, including the opening and closing credits songs.

I'd watched the show online when it came out, so now I'm working my way back through the show.  I'm still on disc one as of writing this, and I haven't had a chance to listen to the CD yet.

For someone like me, this is a great way to get Sword Art Online on DVD.",1420934400,11,897,4.387878787878788
8675511,2,B00N0EC9H0,"It's great to have the full series but when I opened the box and found that it was only subtitled English I was sorely disappointed. I rechecked the listing and it doesn't say any of the spoken languages on it.

Just the subtitled so I am guessing my brain did not register the way it was typed and assumed it was all the languages listed were spoken languages.

If you don't mind just having subtitled you will love the look of the package.

I will probably just try to sell this dvd in my store since it is not what I wanted at all. :-(",1417737600,13,538,4.104761904761904
