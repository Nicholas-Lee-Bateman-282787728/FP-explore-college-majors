4466701,1,B004UA8D14,"This movie defines AWFUL. In fact awful is a polite term for this rotten film.

Michael Madsen must have needed money REAL bad to be in this turkey. Despite being listed as the ""star"" of the film, his character has no real involvement in the film.

The script is atrocious. The ""acting"" is merely horrible in comparison.

The special effects are neither special nor effective.

I've been better cinematography in an amateur YouTube video. You also have an 1887 library with paperback books and a town that looks way too modern with streets that aren't mud but instead have crushed rock.

Finally the container for this DVD shows an entirely different film by its pictures and descriptions than what you wind up seeing.

Some reviewer named Stuart Alson says this is the best movie Madsen has done since ""Reservoir Dogs"". My response? Mr. Alson needs to be given a drug test - several in fact. I want to know what he was drinking, snorting, and/or smoking to make that comment.

Even though I got burned by buying this thing, I'm glad I got it second-hand. Some other fool made Lionsgate a few bucks, not me. I concur with other reviewers who say avoid this film at all costs. Wish I had seen those reviews before entering my local Hastings Entertainment outlet. Furthermore, I would think twice before buying ANYTHING from Lionsgate based on the trailers available on this DVD.

This film is without question THE WORST WESTERN EVER MADE. If you have someone you don't really like, give them this turkey of a film as a gift. Their misery will give you the best joy from this indescribably lousy film.",1312934400,2,1599,4.685714285714286
4466702,1,B004UA8D14,"This is really bad. The acting is so hokey and unconvincing. Madsen does practically nothing and his appearance is almost an after thought. The sound is terrible. Gunshots sound distant as if recorded on a cheap video camera. The special effects, as in dynamite explosions, are so hokey it makes me wonder if they used cartoon animators. This film smells like low,low budget. I can watch almost any crappy film but this was almost too much for me. Its one of the few dvd's that went straight from the dvd player to the trash!",1311206400,5,525,4.595744680851064
4466703,1,B004UA8D14,"This ""movie"" is so bad that it is actually funny to watch. Terrible dialogue and wooden characterizations abound in this (Sorry, I can't force myself to insult other movies by calling this turkey a movie!) artless waste of time and film. Even the scenery is silly. Picture this: an 1887 western railroad town, with a nice smooth gravel main street! Not a horse hoof print or wagon track to be seen anywhere! The most entertaining thing about this movie was simply watching how unbelievable it was.",1309651200,4,497,4.790697674418604
4466704,1,B004UA8D14,"Review title says it all.

I rated this 1 star out of 5 because they don't give you the option to choose no stars.  Don't waste your money on this film.  A pre-school class could have made something more entertaining than this.  I feel robbed by the people who put this movie out there.  If I could go back in time and had the choice between paying for this movie or throwing $100 down a toilet I would've chose the latter just because I wouldn't want to give the film producers 1 cent of my money for this rubbish.",1309392000,4,515,4.161616161616162
4466705,4,B004UA8D14,"The acting and dialouge are so bad, the movie is funny. I was in  LOL mode during the first hanging scene as a woman pleads for the life of the boy being hung. ""Please, please, he is so young. Take me instead!""

Michael Madsen plays a US marshal on the take. The soundtrack is confusing at times as I expect zombies to appear at any moment. The camera gives a lot of facial close-ups while people are talking, although not always on the person doing the talking.

Scarsdale (Dave Long) has hired thugs to seize land and a town because the RR is coming through. As people get killed, Elizabeth Drayton (newcomer Heather Clark), having been raised by Indians too poor to send her to acting school, looks for her long lost daddy, sharpshooter William Drayton. It isn't hard to figure out how these two subplots come together.

William Drayton (Jim Hilton),who learned acting by watching Sam Elliot movies, has more dramatic pauses than a William Shatner film festival. The film was written, directed, produced, edited, and music written by Christopher Forbes, best known for being the illegitimate son of Ed Wood (just kidding, although if you told me it was true, I would believe it.)

The pieces where a character steps out and does some good acting are few and far between and actually make the movie worse.  For me when an actor shows that they could be good in one scene but in the next scene are bad, well that just nmakes the movie worse.
I watched this film because of Michael Madsen.  But even he was a disappointment.  And I do not think it was just because his good scenes were edited out.

Consider a bowl of delicious fruit.  You pick up a nice looking strawberry and bite into it only to find that the bottom 2/3 is rotten and all the fruit underneath is moldy.  Yep not worth the effort, and I wouldn't even want to eat the good parts.",1430265600,,764,4.121621621621622
4466768,1,B004UA8D14,"Was Michael Madsen simply in a very charitable mood when he signed on to this...this...wtf could I call this?  This ""film"" rather defies categorization; I certainly would think of it as another modern addition to the Western genre as this movie is an insult to that venerable mainstay.
  I have to say here that I'm really, really disappointed in Michael Madsen, who I've always thought had a commanding presence on screen...till I saw this.  Whenever I see Madsen, I immediately recall such credits as ""Donnie Brasco,"" ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Species,"" to name a few.  But this!!!  All I can think is, given the prominence of his second chin, the catering on this stink fest must have been top notch in order for him to have shamelessly reduced himself to what looks like a homie done by a bunch of weekend warriors who are Old West enthusiasts.
  So, if you have stumbled haplessly upon this title, save yourself the nausea and the heartbreak over Michael Madsen's obviously rotting filmography, and either rent ""Donnie Brasco"" to see Mike as he once was, memorable that is, or, if it's a Western you're looking for, type in ""Silverado.""

4466786,1,B004UA8D14,"I watched this movie last night on Netflix, and it was horrible!

Every aspect of what makes a film enjoyable is rendered terrible in this effort.  Right off the mark the cinematography provides several examples of multiple faces in the same frame where all but one face is so out of focus you cannot even see who they are, or other examples where dialog is uttered, but the character speaking has the bottom half of his face below the eyes chopped off.  This isn't a case of Sergio Leone brilliance where an ultra close up focuses on a shifting eye, or a bead of sweat, to highlight building drama.  No, it is simply sloppy camera work, as none of these photography gimmicks are set to match any particularly dramatic portion of the movie.  Worse are the other moments where a wide angle scene reveals a shaky camera!  It is the first time in my life I watched a movie where the camera shakes because the producers cannot use a tripod!

This leads to the plot.  Is there one?  Yes, there is a plot, but best of luck learning anything of merit from it.  Yes, the bad guy (Scarsdale) has some association with a railroad.  About all we hear to develop this connection is a disjointed scene where a brief mention is made that the train is really fast, able to cross the continent in a week, which of course means it's the same speed as any other train.  There is a girl who somehow gets separated from her parents and her mother actually tells her husband to stop looking for her, but the father instead cannot stop looking so he does so by lying about looking for lost cows!  Yes, that really was supposedly an important plot line in this work, as it setup the tortured soul of the hero, William Drayton, a man presumed to be a ""crack shot"" as a ""Confederate sharpshooter.""  We learn of this hokey setup because Drayton spends valuable film time telling his now 21-year old daughter this story of how her mother gave up looking for her but that he could not.

The dialog is stilted.  Every character assiduously avoids the use of contractions, and all speech is rendered in the form of complete sentences, except for Michael Madsen who occasionally gets in a few more appropriate moments of dialog that comes close to natural.  It was as though the producer fell in love with the western novel of Charles Portis that spawned two outstanding western movies by the same title, True Grit.  The problem here is that the Portis classic pulled it off because, even though the dialog was original, it flowed well.  The dialog in this film was stiffer than honey on a cold winter day in Canada!

The top billed actor in this project is of course Madsen, a performer of significance who's talents here are utterly wasted.  But, in this film his character, identified simply as ""US Marshall Stallings"" had practically no developed background.  He wears the badge and seems to perhaps be someone working both sides of the fence.  He hates the ""company men"" hired by Scarsdale, and hates their murderous methods, but he steadfastly refuses to go after Scarsdale himself.  In the major gun battle, Stallings allies in some independent way with the hero of the movie, as he guns down members of Scarsdale's company men as our hero weakens from wounds.  But, at the end, he tells the hero, William Drayton, that he won't allow him to kill Scarsdale because Stallings ""couldn't help him"" if he killed a man who hired a company of mass murderers.

The details that are botched stand numerous.  Just one gives insight into how unbaked this film is.  The hero slowly walks to a water tower in broad daylight.  While he slowly walks to this all-important strategic high point in the middle of the town, a dozen armed ""company men"" just stand idle watching him despite already recognizing him.  Worse, the hero was walking with a saddle bag in one hand and a sniper's rifle in the other.  The bad guys are literally 20 yards away and could have gunned him down, but something prevents it.  While they watch silent and frozen, our hero climbs up the ladder to the top of the tower and  practically whispers to the bad guys to leave the town or else.  Then, and only then, do the bad guys appear to recognize the mortal danger and open fire, whereupon our cool hero calmly mutters, ""Yeah, I expected that,"" and unleashes a hailstorm of carefully aimed fire that decimates the company men

Even Clint Eastwood in the Leone spaghetti westerns had the decency to use a single stick of dynamite to hide his movements.  In this movie, no such efforts of diversion are deemed necessary.  Then, there is the issue of the ""period snipers rifle"" carried by our hero.  Despite being billed as his rifle he carried as a Confederate soldier, that sniper rifle is a bolt action model!  Additionally, sticks of dynamite that are said to be unstable due to age, are casually flipped up in the air by the hero and his daughter as someone might playfully flip a stick in the air to catch!  But, when the hero shoots them, they release a burst of energy consistent with a single firecracker that still causes grown men to fall to the ground from the blast wave standing 20 yards away!

As if all that isn't bad enough, the vital train is depicted carrying nothing more than flatbed cars of wood pilings.  Nevertheless, our crack shot Drayton fires a single bullet into the saddle bags hanging on the water tower, setting off 17 remaining sticks of this unstable dynamite.  The explosion is poorly rendered with the force of two firecrackers!  A badly spliced scene then shows the tower falling over, dumping timbers on the tracks, causing the train's derailment.  In keeping with the absence of film quality, this death scene was filmed with a camera being rotated haphazardly by hand to pretend to show the train turning over on its side!

As this film meanders its way to a close we learn nothing in terms of what ultimately happens to Scarsdale, nor less about the characters of Drayton or Stallings.  Instead, we are treated to a scene in a dark saloon with what's left of Scarsdale and his company men.  Scarsdale tells his men that he will swear out warrants for William Drayton and the ""young lady who helped him.""  He then says he will increase his reward on Drayton to $20,000 and warns he will stop Drayton if it takes another 100 men to do so.  One of his men then stands up and says he will get Drayton for free, telling Scarsdale to ""keep his money!""

A brief final scene immediately follows in a meadow showing the heroes alive and well, and then it all stops.  The film ends abruptly.  The viewer is left with an empty feeling as this farce has concluded, but with the implications that there might be a sequel to a movie scarcely worth the effort to make, much less watch.  For me personally, one bitterness is added.  Why is it that, for the first time ever, a character uses my last name of Stallings, but in a movie so unsatisfying as this one?  Why couldn't have the Madsen character just used Smith or Jones so I could have enjoyed the anonymity!  Or better yet, used my name in an effort that allowed this fine actor to show the chops he has shown in so many other movies over the years?  All we are left with instead is the conclusion that we as viewers wasted our time on a movie who's ending was as equally bad as the specter of watching it!",1406592000,,7324,4.538871951219512

""A Cold Day In Hell"" has horrible dialogue, horrible historical accuracy, horrible sound, ...; like everyone was in the sound booth. BAD BAD BAD.  I don't think it could have been worse if they tried.

  At first I thought it might be an amateur home spun deserving at least some credit for effort but according to IMDB it is a production movie with a 1.5 million budget. Someone must have been skimming the books.

All the bad stuff makes this movie hard to watch.  Not once did I fall in with the story.  There were always distractions that stop you from actually living in the moment of the movie and make you think ""what the..?"". An example and random note for the coddled life of whoever wrote this.  In the 1800s a kid was told to do something only one time.  Not the modern nagging parent stuff in this film.  If a child in that era was non-compliant they were given a swift beating. Most kids only made the mistake of not doing as told once if ever. No nagging needed.  That's OK, a lot of whining grown ups in this movie as well.  A second example, although I have not witnessed this directly, one would assume based on the laws of physics that when a man is shot in the chest he should fall backwards instead of their legs coming out from under them. I could rant for days but I have already wasted too much time.  Everyone who does movies should be made to watch this to see how horribly wrong it can go.  NOTE: Compelled to give a star.

because I like Dir. Forbes b(-) westerns because of the actors
in them. David Carradine (2009-1937), r.i.p. was good in the first
of the Will Drayton series based on 'Long Shot', a former War Be-
tween the States vet, who becomes a mercenary after the 1880's.

Drayton's wife (played by Alice Tysinger in 'All Hell Broke Loose')
was killed off in the first installment. Hilton, who grew up a David
Carradine/Sam Elliott fan, recreates the Will Drayton role well
enough, but North American Pictures film Co., distributors insist
in having 'name' actors play lead roles in these productions.

Carradine did well in All Hell Broke Loose, but Michale Madsen is
given the impossible task here of BESTING him, as a corrupt lawman.
Madsen & Carradine did six pics together. The rest of the cast's
acting is awful and amateurish in here. This was a poor Will Dray-

Artistic gaps were needed between actors' lines allowing the scene and the striking natural beauty found in early daylight or at dusk to tell more of the story.  The lighting was simply horrible. Please, less camera jostling. Pick an angle and work it. We honestly didn't need to see the same cowboy from 13 angles in varying film speeds. The signs hanging about in the town were lame.  The gravel road looked state-park cheesy. The town needed smoke, the sounds of a black smith working, saloon music blaring, and an honest whore tossed into a mud puddle.

Overall, lacking from the acting department. Casting needed more outback, weather beaten, crazy leather-faced serious hot-heads; you know them...the really disturbing types that can make a viewer loose sleep at night.  The leader of the bad guys looked like he could have been a contender to replace Steve Perry as lead singer for the band, Journey.

4466826,2,B004UA8D14,"I got this movie as a free rental, and the packaging actually looked appealing.

However, from the beginning it was painfully obvious that this was shot in digital video, I'm guessing a Sony VX2000 - and I actually believe that the in-camera microphone was used to capture the film's sound (Yes, it's that bad!). Watching the opening title sequence, I wondered if the filmmaker (term used loosely) edited the entire project using I-Movie. There's no cinematographer to speak of, in fact, one wonders whether or not the crew had lights at their disposal: note the especially poor lighting - or absence of light - in some of the interior scenes.

The plot's weak, the acting is horrifically amateurish (read: bad), and the look of the ""film"" might be characterized as having, much like all ""video,"" the absence of depth, which is a perfect description for this release as a whole, because the entire thing falls flat!

The lead character (Drayton) attempts to channel the spirit of Sam Elliot - the look, the walk, the voice (note scenes in which his hair is over one eye and the camera is shooting him from a low-angle - a ""poor-man's"" Wade Garrett from ""Road House"") - and, of course, fails miserably, but it's all in good fun. Although, in his defense, he does nail Elliot's voice in certain scenes!

The film actually boasts a special effects coordinator, and the scene where Drayton stops the locomotive by detonating a bag of dynamite, must be seen in order to be believed! Another reviewer captured its description nicely. Trust me, when you see it, your jaw will drop - so, on a positive note I can state with utter sincerity, the film has ""jaw-dropping"" special effects!

Madsen only appears briefly in the film, obviously the ""name"" to generate viewer-ship and secure funding, the greater part of the film is populated by community theatre players, I hesitate to defile the good name of ""Thespis"" by calling them actors, or ""thespians."" But they work nicely as an ensemble - I think I was able to acclimate to the cardboard acting because all were equally cardboard-like, and further, it wouldn't have its overall powerful comic effect had one or two actors actually been good.

With all that being said, I actually enjoyed it, and reveled, as it were, in its atrocious badness (or ""goodness,"" depending how you're defining ""camp"")! It's an unintentional laugh-riot from beginning to end - and I found it highly entertaining from a comedic perspective (if your sense of humor is anything like mine, you'll have the same reaction to Pacino's ""Looking for Richard"" - my all-time favorite film located in the category of ""unintentionally funny"").

The other reviews capture the essence of this release nicely. I just wanted to weigh in and punctuate the point that it's actually a video you're watching and not ""film."" I wouldn't buy it - but, if you have a free evening and can rent it for a dollar, do it, it will reward you exponentially with its unintentional comedic effect!",1316044800,,2984,4.8277886497064575
