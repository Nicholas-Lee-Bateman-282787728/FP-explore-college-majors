6107393,5,B00GSBXU34,"I give a five star rating for these movies because they deserve it!  I have been trying to locate all 4 movies for many years; thanks to Amazon I now have them. Being the Christian woman that I am, I watched these movies with both my sons when they were younger and they really enjoyed them. So, I decided to purchase 2 sets of all 4 movies. One set for them and another set for myself. It was great to watch these movies again and to have possession of them as well.  II would highly recommend these movies for everyone out there.",1399939200,5,531,4.196078431372549

6107409,3,B00GSBXU34,"First and foremost, I think people curious about these should not consider my review as reason not to go ahead and purchase this set as it could be very interesting, entertaining and/or thought provoking if you are in the market for this type of thing. I am commenting on the content relative to my personal experience, and we are all different. Given today's higher tech, glossy movies, these may seem silly anyway - or maybe not! Go with your instinct on purchasing, unless spending the money takes food shelter or clothing away from you or someone else!

 I saw the 2nd and third movies of this series at church around 1979 or 1980 - I think - and I think the experience fundamentally changed me in a harmful way. I had a family member tell me about the first movie (I think the first three were shown in succession over the course of a month or something like that at our Sunday night service - I don't think #4 had been made yet). My memory is foggy as it was a long time ago but I think my mom wasn't sure I should see the first one but then allowed me to see the next two because I wanted to so badly and she caved. She was one to ""screen"" things in our family but once you hit 13 or 14 allowed exposure to what she considered more ""adult"" things like the tv show ""soap"" (anyone remember that?!) and certain movies. Or at least she did that with me, her third kid. Allowance into adult territory came with long explanations to me of ""it's your life as you grow up, but here's what could happen if you...."" Overall - I think she was pretty darn OK. She tried. Some thought she was strict. ANYWAY, I think age 13 or so was not a good age for me to contemplate the content of these films, and I think I have been in a varying state of anxiety/sometimes depression ever since, I function just fine and hold jobs, have two degrees, have had relationships ( I prefer independence unfortunately/fortunately?), etc. I'm not a major success at anything but no one thinks me a major failure per se, etc. I'm single - It's a bit more allowed to be a single female these days! I think I'm average in likability. I analyze things too much but some don't mind. I've just always lived in a low grade state of anxiety ans some don't see it! But back to my point - seeing these movies seemed to usher in a tendency I have to live in fear and dread - sometimes for silly things, sometimes for valid reasons. I don't think I've ever not been scared of or somewhat melancholy about ""something"" since that time. When things seem well I then have a sense of something dreadful about to shake up my world. Would I have been that way anyway, and seeing the middle two movies of this series just happened to have been the time frame that it started because I was getting older? Who knows. Some of my knowledge of brain development stages tells me probably. At 13 you may start being able to hypothesize, imagine your future, etc. Did seeing the version of the ""Christian future"" these movies portrayed, at the age where I could start imagining my own, but had yet to develop coping mechanisms to handle crisis and fear, set the stage for my psychological tendencies to dread/over-analyze/fear ever since? (did that sentence make sense?) Strong maybe. I no longer dread the ""end times"" like I did in the early to mid 80's where every car backfire, jet noise, or moment when it seemed my parents were ""missing"" meant I was not raptured and about to face agonizing tribulation. True fear ""The End"" is rarely if ever on my mind. I now use computers. Obviously. But to illustrate some of my fears after seeing these movies, in 1982 or so my brother bought my dad  a commodore vic 20 computer and i was TERRIFIED of it. I mean lost sleep over it, couldn't concentrate for a week or so because of it. I wanted it gone but true to nature held it in and told no one until I was so psycho about it I confessed to my mom and she eased my anxiety with a long walk and talk. I was breaking out in hives that would not go away! The Benedryl she gave me for those hives also gave me some anxiety relief as I recall. It gave me a moment's peace - it can slow thinking, induce calmness - so my mom,s words could sink in (Mom to me: ""Please tell me when you feel this scared again - I won't tell you it's stupid - I'll listen to you - those were just movies""). I still was fearful and rarely touched a computer if I could avoid it until work forced me to use one around 1998. My true fear abated way before then but I just didn't use one at home - saw no use personally as I was not used to having one.(wish I could go back to hat state of mind!) I quit a required class in college necessary for my undergrad degree (found another option next year) because it involved daily computer use and I could not keep up I was so lacking an any fundamental understanding of computer use. The professor assumed we all knew how to use them and I was too embarrassed to own up. I went to a Christian College so I was probably in the best environment to tell someone these damn movies scared the crap out of me with regard to computers. But I can be ""stupid private"" - especially when I was younger, until I burst.

To buy or not.....are these films bad or worthless? NO. I just binge watched all of them again just now at age 50, and they sort of made me nostalgic for the 70's/early 80's when I was a kid. I've enjoyed the cheese factor and quite frankly I like that they are not so freaking action packed and filled with perfect witty dialogue, detail, and noise-noise-noise, that they feel like a cinematic stress reliever (compared to the noise/constant movement etc, of today's perfect computerized movies). I didn't need a bottle of ibuprofen to squash my ""rapid-eye-movement-headache"" I get with some movies. Will they lead people to Heaven/accept Jesus - the intention of the creator/director? And that was his right, that was his goal and it's still a free country. He did the best he could with the $5.87 he used to make them. But I assume he had good intentions - I'm not questioning that. Not sure it will help people that way if that is what they are working out for themselves (or if someone making them watch them as a ""witness tool""). I don't think I'm a Christian because of them. I am a Christian, albeit very imperfect one - or maybe ""normal"" one. I choose to be one based on my eventual understanding that it's harmful when we do not give ourselves and others ""fresh starts,"" or at least feel relief that we can be allowed  do better with help when we really screw up. I believe a world without forgiveness or understanding can cause ourselves/others more pain, and problems become bigger and more destructive, much more destructive. Or on a less dramatic level if we don't end up in some extreme dilemma, that without that kind of ""forgiveness"" (giving it to others and accepting it from God/Jesus)  our lives are not as at least somewhat peaceful as they could be when things are tough. I believe there are always going to be tough things/we will have temptations to do something not good for others well-being/whatnot. Sometimes we can catch things earlier if we don't fear total condemnation before it gets bad. I believe Jesus basically said things like ""you screwed up here - your thinking is getting out of whack, or you hurt yourself/someone else/others with your behavior/spending/talk. Try to do better - I won't condemn you because no one is perfect but you'll never go forward if you keep hating yourself or others. You will stay stuck in pain/hurtful behavior/etc"". Off my-version-of-the-Gospel soapbox - these movies don't get into real grace and forgiveness for everyday - they are more ""choose or don't choose and if you don't choose you will experience tremendous fear, pain, persecution and eventually you will die die die! But they could  start meaningful helpful conversations that lead someone to really changing their life. They epitomize the people of the ""Jesus movement"" of the 70's"" with the dress and hair and tendency to hang out and rap and end sentences with ""isn't that neat?"" To me, today, they actually look like nicer times. I could use these for a sociology class regarding eras of Christianity. I find changes in culture interesting and I like to then hypothesize why changes occur across tie and all that kind of stuff. Maybe if you buy them, view them as imperfect, but with an open mind and you may gain something valuable or gain an insight or whatnot. I think I felt compelled to write something more to say that the content of these may not be appropriate for people with somewhat underdeveloped coping mechanisms when they get shaken up. Whatever age that may be. I watched all of them in the last couple days and after, out of curiosity, I googled ""The Thief in the night movie series traumatized me as a kid/teenager"" and found people who experienced some significant trauma from them back in the day. Like me. It wasn't just me. What's the relevance of my rambling here to what people may experience today watching these? They may not have enough noise and action and pizzazz to hold a 13/14 year old and younger person's attention these days, and they would not have the impact they did in their day. I think I just wanted to say, with this long, dragged out review, that I just watched these movies again after a few decades. I was feeling scared about something and I felt like confronting them after all these years, because THEY once occupied my mind and caused fear .They also came to mind I think because I was contemplating how we develop psychologically and I think they impacted my development. What I actually found? A lot of things! It was a nice distraction from today/this week's event that is really distressing me. I was reminded and it supported my notion that I think young people are exposed to way, way, way too much before they have the ability to process some things and not be harmed. It reminded me that no matter what you choose to buy and watch, keep in mind we can never ""unsee"" some things, visual things can stay with us and the ""wrong thing at the wrong time"" can harm us. I think we need to spend more time away from tv, movies and computers and doing things that are ""real"" everyday with movies/images/computer stuff, like having talks with supportive and interesting people, spending time outdoors, cooking a real meal, etc.would I have ended up really ""wrecked"" if I'd not had a mom that said ""come on lets take a walk, tell me what's upsetting you so much?"".  I'm reminded it maybe healthier to balancing ""real"" with ""made up"". Even when those ""made up"" things were made with good intentions. I'm reminded  that one of my cousins told me something when I made a comment of ""what will you do without a tv"" a few years ago. She said ""we don't always need to watch tv...."" And went on to name a number of more interesting, healthy and entertaining things to do. And I am generalizing that advice to all things involving watching/computing rather than spending time in reality. Her comment came back to me today, as I contemplate all of this.

6107427,3,B00GSBXU34,"I am giving the four pack three stars. A Thief in the Night and Distant Thunder deliver very strong messages and pretty decent stories. They deserve to be watched and discussed. Costumes and hairstyles are dated of course, but do not detract from the message of the films. These are films done well on low budgets. Having said that, the Image of the Beast just kind of left us feel blah. It seemed dull and lifeless with a lead character that really gave you no reason to cheer for him or the preacher who felt guilty for leading people away. The only character I really liked was Jerry. (The jerk). Our hero in this film had a scripture memorized for every situation he came across and yet, with all his Bible knowledge and faith, he was left behind. I understand why, but his total transformation seemed difficult to swallow. The final film, Prodigal Planet was torture to sit through with unlikable characters and questionable conversions. Holes in the plot were awfulband that stupid code...At every turn, they quessed what the next clue meant and were right every single time but they could not figure out how Unite was able to track them. Well, we had it figured out about a minute and a half after the opening credits. Our hero was so smart cracking codes and quoting scripture, yet we kept yelling at him: ""Open your eyes, you dope."" Jerry was Unite's top agent. That tells you all you need to know about Unite and just makes you wonder how these goofs became the most powerful organization in the world.  Then there was Patty. I really did not see that one coming in the third film despite the ending of the second. Also, there was Wenda. I liked Wenda. The message of salvation was delivered in each film, however had the producers just made it a trilogy instead of a quadrangology (that's a made up word for a four parter) I think we would have enjoyed it more.",1463616000,4,1872,4.538461538461538

Its been roughly 32 years since then and Im very impressed that the doctrine is still relevant. The scenarios are still very much plausible today, especially how people can be led to rationalize the irrational and find anyway they can to accept deception as normal.

While the level of acting, low production budget, and video quality is certainly laughable by todays standards, these shortcomings actually aid it in creating the sense of foreboding the actual events will bring about. Its almost like you are watching a reality program playing out.

While others, like todays David A.R. White, have admirably tried to recreate the rapture/tribulation scenario, theyve almost made the tribulation something appealing.

This film series in all its lack luster glory supersedes present day offerings because where it does succeed is in creating a feeling of dread, which will be the genuine emotional condition that manifests when that time comes upon humanity.",1452297600,6,1122,5.114754098360656

Even with the outdated graphics and inferior film quality, it just is more captivating and really seems sincere and genuine. I definitely recommend this to any Christian family.",1447632000,,599,4.504587155963303

6107471,1,B00GSBXU34,"This series was a huge trend in the church when I was about 10 years old. My family watched these films together and they wrecked me and so many other children who saw them during this church era. I have talked to countless people who saw them as children or in youth group and we all had the same experience, FEAR and TERROR of what is to come for the Christian church in the end times. Me and several people that I have discussed this with, all have vivid, fearful memories of these films and can still recall how this fear affected our daily lives thereafter. Please DONT SHOW THESE TO CHILDREN OR YOUNG ADULTS!!! I am so done with the way the church drives people to obedience, by using fear tactics such as these films.",1438819200,4,724,4.330882352941177

6107480,5,B00GSBXU34,"Wow! Not only is it fun to see nostalgia from the better days but this is a very accurate Scriptural interpretation that gets so up close and personal you feel like you know the characters and are there with them as they journey toward the Rapture (and for those left behind) the Tribulation. Patty Dunning (the star) is a perfect portrayal of a typical midwestern ""Christian"": someone who thinks she's saved because she goes to church weekly, reads her Bible occasionally and tries to follow its commandments. True, she's someone everyone would think of as a good person: she works, is a good wife, keeps up a good house, overall has nice friends, attends a young adult Bible study and helps out at the Teen Center. But good works will not get one saved. Patty also has pride: she states she's ""as good as the next guy; maybe better""! This is on the night before the Rapture, when her husband, Jim, who has just humbly accepted the Lord, gets taken. Eventually, Patty is on the road to Hell. She blames friends (who turn out to be false) but the truth is, she had choices all the way to the guillatine whom to serve, as we all do. Further, it was her fault she got to the Tribulation, just as the evangelists from her church state. I have shared this movie series (or, at least its first part) several times as an evangelism tool I hope will be memorable for all who view it.",1436659200,,1376,4.442687747035573

The explicit use of scripture to back the storyline is wonderful.

6107488,5,B00GSBXU34,"The movies were scripturally based with many references to various verses throughout the bible.  While the film was not of the caliber of films today, the theme was true.  I guess if you want a film for action and entertainment of the 2000,s then you would be disappointed.  But if you are looking for an honest bible based film for educational / salvation purpose it is great.  And it is not a feel good film where everyone gets saved and lives happily ever after in eternity.  It is realistic in that area.

It planted some seeds of hunger for biblical prophecy that I carry today. I did not realize it was part of a 4 part series so I bought this set to see them all. It's a early 70's version of the more recent 'Left Behind' series. Still carries a big impact with the message but would not recommend more than the first two mainly because technology changes in the past 40 yrs make them so dated.

It is factual to the bible. These will definitely hold your attention. The first two movies were the best of the four. I recommend them highly.",1521072000,,298,4.245614035087719

8626759,4,B00GSBXU34,"Very out dated, since it was done in the early 70s, but actually, I have not found a better rendition of the end-of-times movie illustrating how the days after the rapture will be.  Other movies are not at all better & cheesier than these movies.  This seems to get to the point better than newer movies.  Newer ones tend to get tangled up in the storyline, rather than keeping on track with the Bible, like these do.  If you can get beyond the dippy-hippy garb, I think these tell the story of the Post-Rapture times a cautionary tale.",1514678400,,536,4.438775510204081
