2634437,5,B000HD1COS,"Another motorcycle adventure classic from the guys who took us on a ride from London to NYC - the long way... This time they leave Ewan McGregor at home and Charlie, Russ and Claudio and some new characters get to taste the dirt, sand and trepidations of the legendary (Paris) Dakar race. Even though Charley never gets to ride around the Pink Lake (he still whines like a baby), his teamate/buddy and trainer Simon Pavey does. It is a great story of perseverance, adventure, dedication, luck, failure, ignorance and final triumph.",1175212800,4,531,4.846153846153846
2634438,4,B000HD1COS,"Still a good series none the less.  This time the series features only Charlie Boorman, although Ewan McGregor does make a couple of cameo appearances.

The Pairs to Dakar is one of the toughest if not the toughest race in the world.  What the competitors go through is just incredible and it is no wonder the race has had quite a few fatalities over the years, including one during the filming of this series.

As with the Long Way Round the first couple of episodes are concerned with race prep and trying to get Charlie race fit.  Enter Australian Simon Pavy (sp?), race competitor extraordinaire.  He takes Charlie under his wing and gives him some gruelling workouts trying to get him ready.  Unfortunately both desire and luck are not on Charlie's side with him pulling out of some three hour enduro races (that weren't a patch on ONE day of the Paris to Dakar) or being injured on the second day of dune training.  Not only that but the support vehicle is having it's own share of problems and with 24 hours before leaving it's still not finished!

Still Charlie amazes us all when he gets to the real thing and puts in some monumental gruelling efforts.  The same can't be said for the support vehicle which is plagued by electrical and mechanical problems.  At least Russ Malkin didn't roll it this time...  Injuries abound and the bikes are put down countless times.  That's of course when they're not buried to their axels in the soft sand of the dunes being threatened with getting run over by the car/truck competitors that seem to have little regard for the motorcyclists.

All and all a very enjoyable series and while it didn't seem to have the depth that the Long Way Round did, I still enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone who got a kick out of Long Way Round.",1169510400,11,1795,4.5514018691588785
2634439,5,B000HD1COS,"Okay I first heard of the Dakar rally long ago, but didn't really get into it until the last two years.  Now I am a huge fan of this race, great winter viewing.  I am also a huge fan of ""Long Way Round"", with Charly Boorman, and Ewan McGregor.  When I first heard that this DVD was available I couldn't believe it.  It is a great DVD and movie.  Charly is a little whiny, but he is not a racer and did one of the hardest races in the world.  Kudos to Charley.

The only problem that I have with the whole deal is that the DVD that I got was PAL, not NTSC.  WHen I bought my copy in Dec 2006, it still listed the region code as unknown, now it says NTSC.  I have my doubts about that.  It is just now being played on TV here, and has been out for awhile in Europe, so be careful with what you are getting, or you may be watching it on the computer as I did.  When I contacted [...] about it they sent some weird reply that did not even address the issue that I had written about.  I would buy from them again, but I would make sure about what I was buying before I got it.

Enjoy the movie it is well worth the money.  Especially if you are a LWR fan.",1166486400,7,1150,3.8177966101694913
2634440,1,B000HD1COS,"if they won't keep track of region code you can't really do businsss with them, sorry.
Out of 4 players the only place this will play is a linux laptop.
 why would I pay for somehting and then have to  act like its pirated  anyway?",1400544000,,231,4.088888888888889
2634441,5,B000HD1COS,"This is an outstanding documentary from a very interesting ""regular-motorcycle-guy"" perspective. The Dakar race is seen to be at the pinnacle of extreme sports and the racers themselves are all extreme thrill seekers who crave to live ""on the edge"".  These are not normal people who do this. Charlie Boorman, on the other hand, is more or less a normal guy who loves to ride his street or dirt motorcycle - but he decides to try to step way up to the huge challenge of riding in the Dakar Race. If you liked his earlier videos with Ewan McGregor, you will like this one - its edge of your seat watching at times, and gut wrenching at others, as Charlie finds out the Dakar is a deadly serious 2 week race ridden by people who are willing to die to race.",1394064000,,753,4.340425531914893
2634442,5,B000HD1COS,"I like Charley's down to earth realistic video on taking part in one of the world's toughest motorcycle races.  Nice to hear and see the human side of what it takes to take on such an extreme adventure.  Its is gripping adventure and has all the thrills and spills you'd expect from a motorcycle racing video, and yet also provides a feel for the human side, with the worries and fears thrown that often go unmentioned.  I loved it and highly recommend it.

You should also see long Way Round and Long Way Down - both first rate motorcycle adventure series from the UK. All three of these are in my favorite videos to watch when I'm stuck in the house and dreaming of doing something exciting. They may inspire you to do more with your life too!",1383091200,,745,4.3768115942028984
2634443,3,B000HD1COS,"I really liked watching Long Way Round and Long Way Down; in those films, particularly the former, the chemistry between riders and among the crew in general was so enjoyable. So I was looking to watching this film. Particularly as it reunites Boorman and Malkin. And I have to say I was very disappointed in the result.

Even in LWR and LWD you feel a little that the riders are a bit precious and privileged - they've got a corporate machine behind; they prepped their bikes in swank London digs and then when things broke down, had part flown in and all kinds of logistics on offer. The contrast with the occasional minimalist solo traveler that they ran across was stark (especially when those folks were on bicycles!). Still you rooted for them and Charlie Boorman came across as a focused expert rider, inspiring and generous in his mentorship of Ewan, and a funny, interesting character - someone you'd really enjoy hanging out with or have a beer with.

In this film Charlies' not much fun. Same goes for Russ in his support vehicle. It starts off badly; Charlie seems uninterested in preparing properly physically and mentally - in spite of the massive investment being made. Once underway, they spend a lot of time complaining and generally hating the race, leaving you to wonder why they entered it in the first place. They just don't seem to be having a good time in this film and the antipathy is infectious.

I didn't finish watching it. I give it 3 stars because on the whole it is still a pretty good exposition of what a massive undertaking the Dakar Race is - for participants, organizers, crew, and everyone else involved. In my opinion in meanders in a reasonably acceptable fashion until about just half way, and then it loses it's way so badly that I turned it off.",1380672000,,1787,4.630914826498422
2634444,5,B000HD1COS,"Bought this as a gift for a deployed service member.  These are his thoughts:

Awesome documentary for any automotive race enthusiast!
Im intrigued and want to know more about Dakar.
Its a firsthand video of the trials of the race.
Ill watch it over and over",1377216000,,258,4.586956521739131
2634445,5,B000HD1COS,"Great for a laugh. Charley is always pushing things like a child, which is great fun to watch! would recommend.",1369267200,,111,4.6
2634446,5,B000HD1COS,I knew Charley had competed in the Dakar but I hadn't seen the DVD. I took it to work and we watched it over our lunch breaks. Very well done and interesting to watch. Goes very well in between watching Long Way Round and Long Way Down.,1365379200,,236,4.042553191489362
2634447,5,B000HD1COS,"Charlie and his team did an outstanding job.  BMW has the equipment to tackle just about anything.  I have seen most LWR,LWD, and Extreme Adventures.  All very well put together.  I recommend all of the Boorman/McGregor adventures.",1355875200,,231,5.162162162162162
2634448,2,B000HD1COS,"In which Charley decides to ride the Dakar, enlists 2 experienced team mates, receives BMW bikes prepped by Touratech, a staff SUV from BMW (then modified by a leading off road builder) and a 40 ton support truck loaded with spares.  He also gets 2 mechanics and a team manger plus a couple of camera folks.  Back in London he has an office with full support staff. He then proceeds to whine throughout most of the documentary.

If you're expecting much racing footage in a documentary about a 9,000 KM off-road rally you'll be disappointed.  Some oft-repeated wide shots and brief helmet cams from Charlie's team bikes is about it.  As for other competitors, unless they're talking to one of our team they may as well not exist.

It's worth watching but probably not worth buying if you get my drift.",1321920000,,801,4.6453900709219855
2634449,1,B000HD1COS,"Charlie Boorman in `RACE TO DAKAR'

Having recently given this one a go, this reviewer was left with a rather underwhelming experience. Lots of head shots of the toothy English Star on his `diary cam' with extended diatribes detailing his inner-most insecurities. Same shots of the Film Director, repeatedly chronicling his complaints and the various difficulties, problems, mishaps, breakdowns, accidents, etc. All include liberal doses of invective, and naval (or construction site) language.
Included are such spellbinding scenes of the aptly named Star of the film, signing up for a gym, receiving a body fat index measurement (he wins bigtime) and doing pushups with the assistance of a personal trainer. In addition Boorman fans are treated to motorcycle action shots of himself and a professional rider, Simon, (who valiantly tries to hide his real feelings), puttering about the English woods. This series culminates in the Star entering and riding in 3 amateur motocross races (which compromised the body of his initial pre-dakar racing experience). In these races, he receives several DNF's  (pulling out due to fatigue and or soreness) and finally one finish with a 17th place.
Lots of this kind of stuff, liberally interspersed with more of the `diary cam' head shot babblings, home scenes with his families comments, (the pre-adolescent daughter's comments are particularly relevant), action scenes of the `team' being assembled, the garage being chosen, the 3rd racer buying antiques at an outdoor 4 am auction, a big truck being hired and so on and on. After a little more of this than a reasonable person can be expected to endure, the action finally moves to the actual Dakar Race itself. The viewer is treated to a few scenes of the race itself, with 3 to 5 second shots of actual car and bike race action (including several mishaps). Thankfully for viewers with short term memory loss, these same scenes are repeated over and over. It is possible that many will not notice the repetition, since they are sort of `cleverly' dispersed throughout the footage. Then back to the `diary cam' and many `behind the scenes' shots of bikes coming into the camp, bikes leaving the camp, the action at the camp while they wait for the bikes to come back or leave. Other exciting scenes include the racers sleeping and race participants in the cafeteria line. There is even one insightful scene of the mechanic sleeping and being awakened by one of the real racers (Simon) requesting bike prep for the upcoming race leg. The somnambulant mechanic makes such informed and astute suggestions as `didja check the fluids'. Thrilling and informative action indeed.
A few more short scenes of the racing action from the helmet cams. Some arguments interspersed with the same language noted previously. A major mishap occurs as the Star crashes and injures himself, which takes him out of the race. The film crew's 4WD breaks and there is a lot of film dedicated to this issue, further emphasized with the trademark scene repetition. The ordering of replacement parts is painstakingly detailed and the whole repair is exhaustingly documented. The many shots of the stationary vehicle add emphasis to the direness of the situation, as do the shots of the many folks stopping to offer a hand, water, communication service, etc. The shots of the film crew Chief calling England on his satellite phone are superb. Meanwhile a out of the race and visibly relieved Star waves his bandaged arms about and comments extensively on camera, he also flies around on a big cargo plane, although the reason is not really made clear, while kind of squished behind the pilot's compartment, (the camera is carefully positioned to make this clear). To Boorman's credit after his crash, he rides a long way with broken bones in his hands, this takes real guts, so he has it in him, but surprisingly this is underplayed.
There is s same map sequence  repeated sort of randomly with the same red flashing dot in the same place, which is the site of the 4WD breakdown and initially meant something, but it is not terribly clear why this is repeated from scene to scene. Lots of random shots of different stuff including some short `head cam' action from the 2 remaining real racers traveling what looks to be the same (or same type of) crummy dirt / sand road. Then more `diary cam' action, more behind the scenes action, more complaining, etc. etc., on and on, until finally this reviewer ended up with a DNF.

To sum up, since there are 2 discs and hours of what some may feel is viewing pleasure. This film is probably a great choice for those who have lots of time on their hands, a predilection for salty language, little to do and few viewing choices, such as the incarcerated.

Rating based upon the international FF scale:
7 of 10 at 1X FF and 4 of 10 at 2X FF along with finally receiving a DNF

Although this reviewer loves motorcycles, the same passion cannot be extended to this piece of film work and it's not just because riding motorcycles is always better than watching them.",1267920000,2,5068,4.873549883990719
2634450,4,B000HD1COS,good bike movie-- should also see Charley in the Long Way Down,1265414400,,62,4.25
2634451,1,B000HD1COS,"If I was able to actually ""play"" this DVD, I would give you a rating on the DVD content.  Instead this rating reflects the ordeal we've endured just get the DVD to play.  In September, I ordered this DVD from  Movie Mars.  I also ordered ""Long Way Round"" from another Amazon seller. Both DVDs were Christmas gifts.  Out of the box, neither ""Race to Dakar,"" or ""Long Way Round"" would play in the home player. (a player which is fine BTW)  It is now January 14th and we've yet been able view these DVDs.  Movie Mars responded to my email indicating they may have sent a DVD meant for international markets.  I checked, but the DVDs were not marked for international.  However, I was able to get the DVDs to play on a neighbor's portable DVD player.  So yesterday, I purchase a brand new Sony DVD player from Best Buy.  But, yet again, the DVDs ordered from both of the Amazon sellers will not play.  Back to Best Buy.  Fortunately for me this time,  I spoke with a BB employee who would actually diagnose the problem with these DVDs, leading to the purchase of yet a 2ND BRAND NEW Toshiba DVD player from BB.  Now, $120.00 and 2 brand new DVD players later, and I will finally be able to watch these DVDs.",1263427200,2,1203,4.331838565022421
2634452,4,B000HD1COS,"This book follows the lines of the other Charley Boorman/Ewan Macgregor books.  It is an entertaining account of a motorcycle challenge that I, as a motorcyclist, dream about but would never try.  The book goes into a bit more detail in a few spots than is necessary, but overall a good read.",1241222400,,292,4.596153846153846
2634453,5,B000HD1COS,This is a very good DVD set that I really enjoyed! It is at least as good as the Long Way Round or Long Way Down series. Charley give the Dakar Rally his best shot...you'll have to watch it to see how he does. This is worth every penny...pure enjoyment!,1225584000,,253,4.08
2634454,3,B000HD1COS,"the pari-dakar is better covered by speed tv, when it happens...although that could be because it doesnt focus only on one team. but on the flipside, it does give one a better opportunity to see the behind-the-scenes moments, and how truly grueling a race this is",1222992000,,263,4.739130434782608
2634455,5,B000HD1COS,"After having seen both Long Way Round and Long Way Down, I was a little concerned that this would be another rushed trip that could have been a little better. It is not. Dakar is a great film about the race. It's not just poorly planned travel, but an exciting look at a big race the US doesn't see much of.",1216166400,5,307,4.049180327868853
2634456,4,B000HD1COS,"If you saw Long Way Around (LWA), you could consider Race to Dakar (RTD) to simply be Part II.  (Long Way Down being Part III).  If you didn't see LWA, you should read those reviews to familiarize yourself, since RTD constantly references it.

The mostly-same crew is back, with some differences.  Ewan is not riding this time, but he shows up anyway about a hundred times.  Russ is the coolly efficient manager and producer, and still a bit of a wanker.  He doesn't like people disagreeing with him.  Claudio is the cameraman again, though he's totally backgrounded this time.  Other people fade in an out, including other riders and the support team.

RTD follows a three-man team of motorcycle riders on the Dakar Rally (better known as the Paris-Dakar Rally, though it doesn't start in Paris anymore).  While it's another motorcycle trip like LRW, the two are not so easily compared.  The big difference is that on LWR, you knew they were going to make it, even if they had to cheat a bit by riding trains or getting carried on trucks.  But RTD has rules.  You can't break down and spend a few days fixing your bike, or take a rest day.  One good breakdown or spill, and you're out.  More than half the riders who start the race don't complete it, and so the question in RTD becomes whether our heroes can make it or not.  The drama level is much higher, because we know the odds are against them.

I had the series a bit spoiled for me by knowing in advance whether Charlie would make it, but it didn't ruin things; the series is still well worth watching even if you know the ending.

Charlie is not only the star of the series, but one of the surprising bright spots.  In LRW, he was a bit hard to watch, and didn't benefit from the comparison of being paired with Ewan McGregor.  Alone, he shines much more.  He seems to have gained some maturity along with his new haircut.  As for the other two riders, Simon is a bit of an enigma and not a terribly interesting person, seemingly having only one emotion, and Matt is all but invisible much of the time, only becoming poignant while having quite the adventure after getting stuck in the sand.

RTD is much grittier than LWA, as befits such a rally.  You get a sense of the dangers and the vulnerability that change or a small lack of logistics can bring.  One well-known rider died after a crash, as did two children, spectators who just happened to be too close to the road.  Four-letter word echo constantly.  As with LRA, Charlie is fairly naive about what he's gotten himself into, but when he and the other riders complain about the horrid conditions of the race, you believe them.  One rider looks right at the camera and says ""I'll tell you what--I won't be doing this again.""  For our sake, I'm glad they did it once.",1215993600,5,2784,4.457425742574258
2634457,3,B000HD1COS,"Pretty good overall, although when Charlie is forced out of the competition due to injury, it seems like they were trying to keep the DVD process going, filming him helping out and showing concern for fellow riders. Personally it seemed very false to me.(sorry Charlie)
If you're into the Dakar, its a good DVD to watch.",1206662400,,320,4.732142857142857
2634458,4,B000HD1COS,"I got this for Christmas and was quite excited. I've watched LONG WAY'ROUND several times and was excited to see essentially the same crew tackle the world's most notorious endurance race. I was not let down.

 If you saw LWR, the formula is similar, starting with planning, prep, bike prep and all the joys that go along with it. My heart goes out to Charley with the weight issue. I suffer from the same thing: spend all day working out and still carry a gut. Anyways, without giving away all the fun parts, it's exciting with some humor.

  Race footage is good, not great. I feel some great items are only glanced at, while some not so exciting bits are extended too much.

  The real issue is the language. The ""f-bomb"" is dropped so much it becomes a bit uncomfortable (and I routinely ride with ex-1%ers). I can only imagine the broadcast version of this was edited to death in areas.

 In all, I do recommend RACE to DAKAR, but not for anyone under 18 years of age.",1198713600,17,973,4.415730337078652

I'd be crying like a baby.  Besides Charley shows just how tough he is when the rubber hits the sand.  Although this isn't LWR(but what is, right?) it is a great video and a heck of a lot of fun to watch, everyone is like-able and the filming is top notch.  My only complaint is the theme music, my god is it awful.  Overall, I say buy this, you will not be disappointed.",1188345600,2,539,4.047169811320755
