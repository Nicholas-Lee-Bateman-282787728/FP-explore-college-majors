8333325,4,B001PIHP6I,"The ""Car Guy"" is way too critical.  He obviously
has no clue what he was buying.

I actually attended the KnightCon '97 -- it was
the grand daddy of all the Knight Rider Festivals.  It
was the first Knight Rider national convention EVER.
The UK KnightCon evolved off the idea of KnightCon
97 -- and the Knight Rider Festival in Vegas also
was a result of the die-hard KR fans who made the old
'97 convention a success.  This DVD is a great
way to look back at the primitive start to KR
fan festivals.

Still, for all its faults -- KnightCon '97 was
the only time a Team Knight Rider vehicle has ever
been photographed with the Knight 2000 from T.O.S.
(in this case, the Attack Beast) EVER.  KnightCon'97
was a stop on the TKR Road Rally '97 to promote the
syndicated TV Show of that era.

Overall, the video takes a look at KR memorabilia,
the TKR Attack Beast, the KR2000 and where the
convention took place.  The video is a little short,
but again it was produced by fans and not professionals.
I'm sure they did the best they could with what they
had.

There is no narration.  All the information was
provided through subtitles.  This is common to
many documentaries (I have several railroad
documentaries that were similar).  Overall, if
you are a fan of KR -- its not a bad DVD to
complete your library.",1282003200,,1308,4.404166666666667
8333326,1,B001PIHP6I,"This item was a total waste of time and money. It showed nothing of any consequence, not even people were shown on this video, let alone The Knight Rider car or anyone from the show. I'm not really sure what it's point was. Appeared to be a home video just panning around the convention site with some backround music. No narration or anything at all. Don't bother with it.",1268697600,5,373,4.420289855072464
