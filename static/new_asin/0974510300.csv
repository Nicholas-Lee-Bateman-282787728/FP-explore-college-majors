173917,5,0974510300,"The works of venerable horror writer H.P. Lovecraft have, in many ways, become the backbone of the genre, especially cinematic horror. An astonishing number of relatively contemporary horror flicks and genre TV shows--everything from 1965's DIE, MONSTER, DIE through Rod Serling's series THE NIGHT GALLERY (1970s) to Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD (1981)--have either borrowed elements from Lovecraft's literary mythos or attempted to adapt one of his stories.  But in spite of the writer's influence on horror cinema, few filmmakers have been able to accurately or faithfully translate Lovecraft's works to either the small or large screen. At best, most attempts to adapt Lovecraft either vaguely evoke the nihilistic subtext of the author's work (e.g., Stuart Gordon's 1985 classic RE-ANIMATOR) or pay simple homage by making a reference or two (as Raimi does by building his EVIL DEAD stories around Lovecraft's ubiquitous fictional book of the occult, the Necronomicon).  Bryan Moore's COOL AIR is a standout exception to this rule.

Set sometime around the 1920s, COOL AIR tells the story of a young writer who befriends a mysterious and reclusive physician, Dr. Mu&ntilde;oz, who resides in his same tenement house. Though Mu&ntilde;oz has a medical condition that requires him to remain in his constantly frigid apartment, the two men visit together often and become very close.  But when something happens to the cooling unit that controls the temperature in good doctor's apartment, the writer learns more about his friend's condition than perhaps he ever wanted to know.

Although the original story is devoid of any real dialogue--indeed, the Lovecraft's narrator recounts his experience in what is very nearly a straight soliloquy--the filmmakers, out of dramatic necessity, use dialogue to reinterpret portions of Lovecraft's written word.  Still, the film is not dialogue heavy.  The filmmakers also skillfully employ unusual camera angles, light and shadow, sound design, and music to skillfully recreate all of the subtle, almost intangible uneasiness--and, ultimately, the horrible denouement--of the Lovecraft work.

Of course, the actors also aid immensely in conveying both the art and horror of the original story. Vera Lockwood is delightful as the curmudgeonly landlady of the tenement house.  And as the young writer who befriends the mysterious Dr. Mu&ntilde;oz, Bryan Moore--who also wrote the script and directed--creates a thoroughly convincing sense of credulity and naivet&eacute;.  But it is the venerable Jack Donner, portraying Dr. Mu&ntilde;oz, who steals the show.  Donner has created numerous characters over the years on everything from classic STAR TREK to BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER to a recurring role on the soap GENERAL HOSPITAL, and here he uses those skills to adeptly convey the grandfatherly and cultured facets of Mu&ntilde;oz while simultaneously maintaining the sense that something horrifying lurks just beneath the facade.

The DVD edition of Moore's COOL AIR is well worth the price of admission.  It features a pristine copy of the film--be aware that the film as shot in black-and white, and faux scratches and grain were deliberately added to give the sense that the film was actually shot in the era in which the story is set--in its original Academy aspect ratio (essentially 1.33:1), and the soundtrack (in Pro Logic two-channel surround) is very crisp and clear.  The disc is also chock-full of extras, including four other short films inspired by Lovecraft works, a making-of featurette entitled BEHIND THE MACHINE, an interview with Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi, and more.  A must-have for Lovecraft fans and those who appreciate well-crafted, ""old-school"" horror cinema.",1229990400,21,3726,5.455652173913044

173919,4,0974510300,"I was very impressed with the quality of the short films here. All of the films are true works of art which pay respectful tribute to the master of horror, H.P. Lovecraft. Cool Air is a superior film worthy of any film festival. It is beautifully photographed and for the most part, quite well acted. It is well worth checking out if you are a Lovecraft fan.",1188086400,4,358,4.358208955223881
173920,4,0974510300,"I've been gorging myself of Lovecraft lately and decided to give a film version of his work a shot that wasn't ""The Necronomicon"".  ""Cool Air"" is a wonderful film. The cinematography is wonderful, the actors do a good job in their roles and the story takes on a much more human and sad quality than the original short story it was based on. The making of feature was informative and entertaining in its own right.

Unfortunitely I watched the other shorts on the disc. Maybe I should have watched them first, because after cool air they just look like what they are. Ameteur short films done using Adobe Premier with some very bad costumes and props.

In the end though, I have to say I'm happy I bought it. The shorts are at least good for a little bit of a laugh.",1127001600,7,765,4.373239436619718

173922,5,0974510300,"The Story:

Renting a small one room apartment Randolph Carter continues his writing of short stories for pulp magazines. Suddenly he is stricken by a heart attack and seeks assistance from Dr. Muoz, his upstairs neighbor. Once a prominent physician Dr. Muoz leads a hermit like existencein a artificially cooled room. While recovering from the attack, Carter learns more and more the secrets of the mysterious doctor and why he has the need for ""cool air"".

The winner of the 1999 H.P. Lovecraft film festival, Bryan Moore's Cool Air is now available on DVD thanks to Lurker Films.

The Picture:

Cool Air is presented in a full frame 1.37:1 aspect, identical to what it would have been if it was filmed in 1925. Shot on 16mm film, Cool Air has all of the visuals that you would expect from a film of that period. Imperfections are intentional, the film is light and grainy. Since this film was intentionally shot to look like it was 75 years old. I'll give a perfect score for accomplishing it tremendously!

The Sound:

A Dolby 2.0 mono track that is again period driven. You get the feeling that you're thrown back to the era of the silent films and early talkies.

Extras:

Here's where this DVD becomes a invaluable treasure for any H.P. Lovecraft fan! Included are the following:

Christian Matzke's An Imperfection Solution (a short film taken from Herbert West: Re-Animator) and Nyarlathotep (told in Lovecraft's first person narrative style, a story of a prophet with visions into the future).

Anthony Penta's The Hound (a grave robbery unleashes a hound from Hell) and The Hapless Antiquarian (it's not always easy to get rid of the most evil book in the world).

A cast and crew interview about the making of Cool Air.

An informative interview with Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi.

An eight page booklet on Lovecraft and these films.

Two opening ads for the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival.

Put together with the extra's Cool Air becomes a 140 minute plus jammed packed DVD!

Summary:

If you're not familiar with H.P. Lovecraft's influence on the genre of horror, it's about time you learned! A writer in the 20s and 30s, Lovecraft penned short stories for publications such as Weird Tales and Astounding Stories. Dying at a young age, Lovecraft's body of work is becoming more and more appreciated with every new generation. The most famous adaptations of his work have been brought to the big screen by Stuart Gordon with Re-Animator and From Beyond. Other notable Lovecraft adaptations have been The Dunwich Horror and The Terror. Still in print to this day, you can find all of his works in hardcover at Arkham House Publishers.

Cool Air is the start of a multi volume series called ""The H.P. Lovecraft Collection"". This series will contain the best of the films submitted at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival, now entering it's twelve year. Bryan Moore has given this short tale a treatment that is heads above anything previously submitted. From choosing renown actor Jack Donner (Star Trek, Mission Impossible, Stigmata, and Exorcism) to play Dr. Muoz, to his decision to shoot this on 16mm film, Moore has brought Lovecraft's story to life in a wonderful way! The other shorts included in the collection all reflect the period which they were written realistically thus creating a Lovecraft fan feast of material.

I anxiously await the subsequent volumes and encourage hardcore Lovecraft fans and even novices to buy this collection. If you're not familiar with Lovecraft's works, visit arkhamhouse.com and buy the books. If you're just a fan of the Stuart Gordon treatments, enrich yourself further with this fine collection!",1099872000,30,3647,4.939443535188216
173923,5,0974510300,"It took me a while to view my copy of ""The HP Lovecraft Collection Vol. 1"" featuring ""Cool Air"", but I am so glad I did. The packaging and design of the disk, including the supplemental booklet (laid out as an 18th century pamphlet), are exceptionally classy and informative. The disk itself contains the featurette, ""Cool Air"", which is a very moving adaptation of Lovecraft's story of the same name and starring Jack Donner (""Star Trek"", ""Man from U.N.C.L.E"", many others) and shot on black and white 16mm film. The amazing set, costumes, writing and acting, led by Bryan Moore (writer/director, and playing lead Randolph Carter) will show you what can be done with a little amount of money and a large amount of talent. The ""making of"" bonus materials explain how much went into completing the film; that in and of itself is a tear-wrenching story.

There are four other short films on the disk, including two by Christian Matzke, called ""An Imperfect Solution"" and ""Nyarlathotep."" Both are great period adaptations of two of Lovecraft's stories, and ""Solution"" manages to do the ""Herbert West: Re-Animator"" story seriously, as opposed to Stuart Gordon's over-the-top satirical feature. There are also two dark gems by Tony Penta: ""The Hound"" (based on Lovecraft's story) and ""The Hapless Antiquarian"", which is a funny homage to Edward Gorey's ""The Gashlycrumb Tinies"". There's also an interview with Lovecraft scholar ST Joshi on the disk.

The DVD is not only entertaining, emotionally powerful (and creepy!), but educational as well. Any fan of H.P. Lovecraft, non-splatter horror films (although ""An Imperfect Solution"" has some very gory bits), and atmospheric ""weird tales"" will love this.

There's no nudity or swearing in any of the shorts (although one of the actors from ""Cool Air"" uses some profanity in the making of material), and only ""An Imperfect Solution"" has serious gore, so this DVD would also make a great gift for a teenager who likes gothic movies or literature (adults will love the seriousness as well).

If you're sick and tired of the same ol' cheesy makeup and CG effects from non-sensical Hollywood horror movies, but you still want to be spooked late at night when the lights are out, be sure to pick this one up.",1099440000,16,2247,4.968085106382978

The acting is superb, the layout is true 1930's,and there is a tense feeling throughout the film.  The movie is not scary, but in true Lovecraft style the horror comes from unnatural existance rather than evil acts.  A must have for Lovecraft afficionados.",1332892800,,354,4.67741935483871
7794605,1,0974510300,"As an avid fan of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, I must strongly protest the rankings that portray this film as a ""5-star"" movie.  Honestly, I did not expect it to be so, as so few of Mr. Lovecraft's works adapt well to the silver screen.  However, I had hoped for an average-quality movie with an interesting adaptation of the short story bearing the same name.

Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.  The cinematography involved filming (or editing) in black and white with a false grainy effect intending to give the movie a feel of age, which came off as cheap and hokey.  In addition, there were numerous anachronisms blatantly presenting themselves on the set.  When setting a movie in a particular era (in this case, the late 1920's or early 1930's), the devil's in the details.  This crew paid no attention to such details (despite going through the ""trouble"" of making the film appear ""old.""  (E.g., ill-fitting wardrobe, 1980's weather stripping on door frames, plywood signs, poor accent work, et cetera).

After sitting through this movie while feverishly smoking cigarettes to calm my nerves, I had planned on rating this amateur work as a ""2.""  However, I made the mistake of viewing parts of the short films included with the main feature, which were filmed ""live-action role play,"" at best.  My evening plummeted further when I decided to watch the interviews with the cast and crew.  Observing these fools foppishly discuss their goals and how great each one of them stands in his own mind, I added straight scotch to my diet.  Their discussions of H. P. Lovecraft were completely ignorant, lacking in substance/understanding, and mockingly derisive at best.  In my opinion, people with such little appreciation for such a great writer should steer clear of his work rather than displaying their idiocy to the rest of the world.  Because of the disrespectful and egotistical crew, I offer but a single star.",1279584000,13,1926,4.975
7794606,5,0974510300,"This is one of the finest Lovecraftian cinematic adaptations I have ever seen, beautifully photographed, superbly written, magnificently performed.  Jack Donner, who portrays Doctor Munoz, gives an exceptionally poignant performance, one that deeply touches the heart and soul.  The handsome Brian Moore, who directed the film, also co-stars, and does a very good job indeed.  The film comes with a very amusing bonus interview with the film's cast and crew.  Also included in this DVD is an interview with the world's leading Lovecraft scholar, S. T. Joshi, plus bonus short film's including Christian Matzke's haunting rendition of H. P. Lovecraft's NYARLATHOTEP.  Brilliant and utterly Lovecraftian to the core!  Yog-Sothoth!",1252713600,13,728,5.63302752293578
7794607,1,0974510300,"I rented this because I'm a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft's, but, even though most screen adaptions of his work are disappointing, this one was unexpectedly bad.  It's a very low-budget effort with some of the worst acting I've ever seen on film.  I'm thinking particularly of the actress who plays the landlady; she doesn't merely chew the scenery, she swallows it whole.  And her Italian accent is the worse I've ever heard.  The guy who plays Dr. Munoz is only slightly better.  Writer/director/actor Bryan Moore, who reminds me a lot of Night Court's Harry Anderson, fares best as the guy who lives in the room beneath the doctor's.

The adaptation is very wordy: the characters recite the things that happened to them, so there's very little physical action.  No character in the film ever acts anything out if they can talk or write a letter about it instead.  That works on the printed page, but generates boredom in a visual medium.

It also seemed that very effort was made to spare expense, including the complete avoidance of special effects, even in places where they were essential.  I realize Moore probably was trying to use restraint, as well as save bucks, by suggesting the horror rather than showing it. But that approach was taken too far. If I wanted to visualize all the horror in my mind, I'd read the short story and not bother with the film (which is actually a pretty good idea.)",1244246400,16,1401,4.681632653061224
7794608,5,0974510300,"When I first recieved this video I have to admit that it took me almost a week to watch it. After having read the original story by author H. P. Lovecraft and after hearing so many terrible things about other movies based off of his work, I was reluctant to even open the plastic wrapping. I was afraid that watching Cool Air would in the end be a waste of time.

Was I ever wrong.

At the end of the movie I was in a state of near shock. I do not know how else to put it, really. There are only really three roles that get any real screen time in the movie - The Landlady, The Renter and Dr. Munoz - but each of the actors brings a wonderful feeling of being present in the film. In addition the way that this film was made helps to surrender your sense of disbelief - the scratchy film amd the odd noises heard in the sound track all help the viewer to surrender to the idea that this is in actuality a much older film than it really is.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. If you are a fan of Lovecraft, then you should see this film as soon as you can. If you enjoy horror movies and can see horror beyond bucket fulls of gore, then this is a movie for you. On the other hand if you think ""Friday the Thirteenth"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" are great horror movies, well, this may not be for you.",1236384000,16,1310,4.011494252873563
