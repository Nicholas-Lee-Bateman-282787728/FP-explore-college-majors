6194527,1,B00HONMA0Y,Not thrilled with.  I now go to a tai chi class and enjoy it.  The slow motion in this drove me crazy. Tai chi is slow enough without slow motion.,1411948800,5,146,3.8333333333333335

6194529,5,B00HONMA0Y,"I had lower back problems which caused back pain and burning pain in my lower legs.  This Tai Chi video, especially the ""walking the ball"" sequence, helped get rid of that pain, by exercising my body in a balanced way.  Nothing else--physical rehab therapy, acupuncture or deep massage--was able to get rid of the pain and imbalances.  My acupuncture/deep massage therapist credits Tai Chi for my improvement, and for her ability to do adjustments that were not possible before.  My collapsed ankles and feet (fallen arches) are correcting themselves!  Tai Chi makes you move in a balanced way, and the imbalances being correcting themselves.",1409961600,20,642,5.134615384615385

6194532,5,B00HONMA0Y,"After doing exercise with the ball, I am able to turn in bed easier and move my weak leg more than before the exercise.  Additionally,
my balance  and elimination are improved. (smile)  I had surgery for melanoma on my right little toe.  Due to this, I was forced to not do exercises or take my MS meds for about 5 months during which time I fell. I was really weak.  I am happy that my strength and confidence are finally being rebuilt by the ball exercises and all other Tai Chi exercises.  I do all exercises in the seated position.  Isn't this remarkable?  Thanks, Anna.  Halima M. Jabulani",1401321600,13,594,4.425925925925926
6194533,5,B00HONMA0Y,The DVD by Anna York is very easy to follow.  Provides great routing for beginners or anyone wanting to brush up on their skills,1400803200,12,128,4.333333333333333
6194534,5,B00HONMA0Y,"This visually stunning video gently brings you into the healing world of Tai-Chi and Qigong.  The walking is an element that has been clinically proven to aid with balance and strength.  The walking exercises are easy to follow and I felt rewarded with more confidence almost immediately.  I had a terrible knee injury two years ago and although practicing Tai-chi, my knee was weak and I still experienced a great deal of pain.  I participated in class mostly in a seated position, which continued to be very beneficial.  Since following the walking exercises in this new video my knee is stronger and I am more confident walking and especially standing for longer periods of time.  Anna York's uncanny ability to combine teaching and healing is a winning combination for the second time.  I certainly hope that there more videos to come!",1396224000,28,839,4.907801418439717
6194535,5,B00HONMA0Y,"I take Anna's class and follow up between class at home using this DVD.  I find it not only very relaxing, but when I finish the sequences I feel more balanced and serene.  I particularly like the gentle stretching and energizing effect.  I feel that her instruction is simple to follow and allows methods for all levels, those sitting or standing.  Even though it is promoted for Seniors, I feel it is advantageous to anyone wanting to improve balance or who is suffering from joint issues and needs  a change from high impact exercises. The landscape sets the tone for the movements which are smooth and even.",1393891200,38,611,4.672897196261682
6194536,3,B00HONMA0Y,It's a bit hard to follow.,1471824000,,26,3.5
6194537,3,B00HONMA0Y,Just ok - not good -not bad.  Probably worth  $18.00.  I'm keeping it and hoping it will grow on me.,1470614400,4,100,3.9
6194538,3,B00HONMA0Y,"way too slow and boring, not even music.",1469318400,,40,4.125
6194539,3,B00HONMA0Y,Good but not as good as her original dvd. This was is definitely more difficult and physically challenging. Still has some useful routines.,1457395200,5,139,5.086956521739131

6194542,5,B00HONMA0Y,"The 'walking the ball' exercise is really good. Unlike yoga,this does not give me fatigue,I can keep going for 30 minutes or more. Very good for increasing strength and balance .Very happy I purchased it.",1430352000,12,204,4.857142857142857

6194545,5,B00HONMA0Y,Aftr several bouts of physical therapy I'm getting back to Tai Chi. I practiced it years ago and just can't get the same satisfaction from yuga,1416268800,3,143,4.538461538461538
8634037,4,B00HONMA0Y,Good instructional dvd,1529625600,,22,6.666666666666667
8634038,5,B00HONMA0Y,"I simply want to say that yes, Anna York's Tai Chi and Qigong Dvds are slow and measured, taught clearly and simply, not to challenge but to allow healing to happen.  The reviewers who criticize them for being too easy should be looking for some other teacher.  I used to be a ballet dancer, but got MS (Multiple Sclerosis, which Ms. York has, too) and had to give up professional aspirations.  For me, the slow, smooth, scientifically proven movements presented here have kept me more active than anything else I've tried.  And they are pleasant and fun to do.  For movement-as-medicine, try this, and don't criticize until you have tried it according to instructions for several weeks!",1524009600,7,687,4.837606837606837

8634044,5,B00HONMA0Y,"2017  Anna York's DVD Walking, Strength &  Balance provided the physical therapy for a compound fracture of the right femur
requiring major surgery, rods and pins. Blood loss anemia compounded the recovery.  The amazing results resulted in flexibility, reduced pain and discomfort and am returning to normal functioning.  Aggressive therapy was too aggravating, exhausting and painful.  I am grateful to have found
this DVD on Amazon, plus I did not have to engage in a complex costly program. As I am starting my 85th year I am happy with the results and
appreciate the gentle form of tai chi.  P.M. Kendrick",1487030400,11,609,4.98019801980198
