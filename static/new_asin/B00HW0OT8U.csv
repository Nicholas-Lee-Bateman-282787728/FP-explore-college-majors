8636580,1,B00HW0OT8U,"Chloe (Melanie Denholme) wakes up with a nude man in her cabin. She has no idea who is this mute,  but she talks to him anyway and is attracted to him sexually. She touches him and transforms into a succubus.

This is another Chemical Burn film that features Melanie Denholme is various stages of nudity. It was extremely boring. The camera had a light glare on it and other filming was done in fuzzy black and white, two artistic experiments that fail to generate anything. In one scene Chloe passes out in her purple top and panties. Moments later she wakes wearing a green top and shorts. There isn't much plot It is similar to ""Anna: Scream Queen Killer"" which features Melanie Denholme talking to the camera as if someone id there.
