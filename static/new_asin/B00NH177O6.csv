Just that there are too little of their bodies of work available. The kind of act you want to see in every scene of a movie. Totally enjoyed this from start to finish, and I know i'll be watching it again.",1444780800,,347,4.4375
8678127,5,B00NH177O6,"Fox Cinema Archive is coming thru in spades with the Ritz Brothers. Only 3 more tritles to go, and all of the team's Fox films will be out. The print used for this release is BEAUTIFUL! 35mm elements for sure and not a mark on it! It even has the long censored scene with Willie ""Sleep N Eat"" Best introducing the Brothers. This scene, running about 30 seconds has never been in any TV package print. It evan has the Fox ""$250,000 Quiz Picture"" tag on the end before the cast credits. So now we have the complete 68 minute film, and I screened it on a 12' screen and it looks AMAZING!

I'm sure we will see ""Life Begins In College"", ""The Gorilla"" & ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" in the future. Just imagine ""The Gorilla"" from a Fox 35mm print. I for one, cannot wait.",1412035200,4,761,4.212328767123288
