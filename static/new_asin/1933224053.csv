I tried it on a bunch of different DVD players and get the same results, a loud buzzing and no picture. Hopefully no one else is getting this; I think it's a bad copy or something.",1391817600,,351,4.0285714285714285

7801711,5,1933224053,"This DVD gives you the ins and outs of the life of this year's Mr. Olympia, Jay Cutler. See how he lives, how he trains, and the unbelievable sacrifices made to be the best in perhaps the world's toughest sport.

The video follows Jay throughout the 2005 season, where he came in second at the Olympia. Cutler has the look and the gab to bring bodybuilding to the masses. While everyone can't look like Jay, we can each improve under his inspiration.",1169856000,3,450,4.487804878048781
