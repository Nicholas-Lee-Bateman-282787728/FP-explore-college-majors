3940439,5,B002KISB56,"I have seen every available version of 'Emma' released thus far that I could get my hands on, and this is by far, my favorite!  The A&E version was well done, and Gwenyth Paltrow's enjoyable (especially Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley, yay!), but this series actually captured the essence of 'Emma'...it was absolutely lovely!

Romala Garai plays Emma excellently: Emma is my least favorite Jane Austen heroine, but I actually like her in this particular version!  Garai brings a certain warmth & vulnerability to the character that makes her quite lovable, even with all her apparent flaws: the movie is quite cute & fun, while at the same time being deep and interesting!

Johnny Lee Miller plays a nice Mr. Knightley, and the chemistry between the two main characters rings true; I will admit to liking Jeremy Northam (from the Gwenyth Paltrow version) just a bit more as that character.  But Miller does an excellent job with the character, and I must say that the others were quite well cast!  Michael Gambon as Emma's father, and Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, was a delightful surprise!

The series comes across with warmth & sunshine, and is just such an enjoyable watch: everyone will love to see this one again & again: by far the best overall version of 'Emma' so far, I will be enjoying this countless times myself: I would highly recommend!",1262390400,20,1360,4.8111587982832615
3940440,5,B002KISB56,"Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma-BBC-1972/dp/B000244F64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma (BBC, 1972)</a>&nbsp;was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma-A-E-1997/dp/0767020308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma (A&E, 1997)</a>&nbsp;which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of ""Emma"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.

This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Capture-the-Castle/dp/B0000SX9MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Capture the Castle</a>,and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Deronda/dp/B000M2E32M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Deronda</a>. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.

The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of ""Mansfield Park""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-1999/dp/6305907145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (1999)</a>&nbsp;which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Byron/dp/B000T28Q00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Byron</a>.I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!

The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-James-The-Turn-of-the-Screw/dp/B0001WTUJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry James' The Turn of the Screw</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Other-Boleyn-Girl-2003-BBC-Version/dp/B00114XM04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version)</a>, as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daniel-Deronda/dp/B000M2E32M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daniel Deronda</a>&nbsp;cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by  Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-Mansfield-Park/dp/B000Z27HMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park</a>.

The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).

Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of ""Emma"" thus far!

DVD features
Contains the scenes deleted from the PBS airing, and in addition:

Emma's Locations - this nine-minute featurette focuses on the locations used during Emma's filming, and why these places were chosen. I just loved the places they used (as is the case with most BBC period dramas) and found this illuminating.

Emma's costumes - this twelve-minute featurette explores the details behind costuming decisions for this period drama, including the choice of fabrics, color, etc. It's really a wonderful opportunity to see what goes on in the costume department, and these folks certainly take their jobs seriously, to wondrous effect!

Emma's music - this ten-minute featurette explores the music behind Emma with a brief description of how one goes about creating a score that matches the mood of the drama (I'd say they did a great job, especially on that Emma-Knightley dance!), and how important this is as the score should complement and not detract from the show itself.

Emma's Mr. Woodhouse - fans of Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore) will rejoice in this thirteen-minute featurette. This veteran actor is truly a great talent, and this interview covers his career from his early beginnings in the craft until today. It's more of a special focus on Gambon, not so much on his role in Emma, but it is a nice touch nevertheless.

I did wish they had a director's commentary (I guess we'll have to wait for a special edition release for that, and spend more money!), and other cast interviews, sigh...but I'm happy to have the drama itself on DVD so that I can enjoy repeat viewings, and have an Emma adaptations marathon (the 1972 BBC adaptation, Kate Beckinsale's A&E adaptation, and of course, Paltrow and Jeremy Northam's pairing in the movie version). Enjoy!",1262131200,562,7633,6.428849902534113
3940441,5,B002KISB56,"While not the first good adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, this will probably become my favorite version. I thought all the characters were particularly well-cast, the lines were great (since they took them from the book :^)), and the sets and filming were beautiful. I appreciated that they decided to film Emma as a mini-series rather than a movie, since it allowed them to expand on the different characters' storylines rather than giving them a passing nod like the previous 2 adaptations have. A true cameraderie comes through between Emma and Mr. Knightley, making their eventual getting-together entirely believable (though I wish they'd come up with a different line for Emma to say at that point). Also enjoyable was the developing of John Knightley and Isabella, Emma's sister--nice to see Emma in the context of her family, rather than just her dad. Mr. Elton was played by the man who played Edmund in BBC's recent ""Mansfield Park."" I liked him as Edmund, but I loathed him as Mr. Elton--which is good! He's so smarmy and full of himself here! I could ramble on and on about how enjoyable this was, but will spare you that and simply say, watch this series! It's great! :^)",1261440000,13,1185,4.813725490196078
3940442,5,B002KISB56,"I've seen the various adaptations of Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" but no movie (or actress) really seemed to capture the lighthearted brightness, romance and sweetness of that book. Fortunately, such is not the case with the BBC's latest adaptation -- it's a sunlit, enchanting little story that dances along at a leisurely pace, and has a brilliant cast headed by the astonishingly good Romola Garai.

After matchmaking her sister and her governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May), Emma Woodhouse (Garai) fancies herself an expert on human nature, and on ""nudging"" couples into matrimony. The acerbic Mr. Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller) isn't impressed.

And after Miss Taylor becomes Mrs. Weston, Emma ends up becoming best buddies with Harriet, (Louise Dylan) a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the illegimate daughter of ""somebody."" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her, and focuses her efforts on matching Harriet to the rather smarmy but charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest matchmaking attempt falls apart, she vows not to mess with people's lives again -- but she can't help but be interested by Harriet's potential suitors.

At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard of her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill (Rupert Evans), and the reserved and ""perfect"" Miss Jane Fairfax (Laura Pyper). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax -- and ends up alienating her further on a disastrous day out. And as she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.

Out of all Jane Austen's books, ""Emma"" is the frothiest and lightest, and this adaptation reflects that well -- it's bright and sunny most of the time, full of ""fairyland"" balls, lush green fields and forests, and the a quaint little village. There's some moments of seriousness (such as the somber, rainy examination of the similarities between Jane, Emma and Frank), but nothing that keeps Emma Woodhouse's sunny charmed life from proceeding as usual.

Fortunately, the story also explores Emma's maturation over the course of a year or two, and the writers also expand on the feelings and lives of Frank, Jane and Mr. Woodhouse. Ir's laced with plenty of clever dialogue (""That man is so full of himself, I'm surprised he can stay on his horse!""), gently barbed humor and beautifully orchestrated moments of subtle romance, such as Emma and Knightley's dance together or Emma's simple declaration of ""I began to examine my own heart, and there YOU were.""

And Romola Garai makes the perfect Emma: young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but  also naive and a little snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, and Garai makes her lovable and endearing even when she screws up. Jonny Lee Miller is similarly brilliant as the restrained, stern Mr. Knightley with his sharp wit and unconventional habits (such as when he tells Emma why he rode a horse to a dinner party).

The supporting cast is also brilliant: Michael Gambon is of particular delight as Emma's dismal hypochondriac dad, who still tried his best for his daughters, and Jodhi May is amazing as Emma's ex-governess. Dylan was adorable as the naive Harriet, and Evans and Pyper are excellent as Frank and Jane. Tamsin Greig, Blake Ritson and Robert Bathurst all do good jobs as well -- and Christina Cole is wonderfully horrible as the snobby, domineering Mrs. Elton.

The newest adaptation of ""Emma"" is enchanting from beginning to end -- beautiful direction, solid writing, and an amazing cast. Definitely a must-see for Austen aficionados.",1260057600,207,3732,5.016155088852988

3940447,5,B002KISB56,"This  may be my favorite Emma. I love the unique perspective at the start of Emma, Frank and Jane losing their mothers so young. While this sequence is not in the book, this emphasizes the unstated loneliness in Emmas situation, a smart girl who has never seen anything if the world, stuck in this backwater of Highbury, which doesnt have enough people fir a dance, caring for her anxious elderly father. Romola Garai is my favorite Emma: high spirited, fun, generous but heedless of others feelings and clueless about her own heart. Jonny Lee Miller is a terrific Mr. Knightley, just slightly better than Mark Strong in the Kate Beckinsale Emma.",1523750400,,646,4.81981981981982

Even though the dialogue was for the most part not true to the novel (flowery early-18th-century language can be difficult for most audiences), and included scenes that did not occur in the book, I very much enjoyed this adaptation as it filled in some blanks and developed some of the minor characters nicely.

Even Public radio is now full of young high-pitched female nasal voices, asserting their know-it-all opinions on the State of the Union. This Emma is portrayed by an excellent actress, allowing us to see the potential  underlying the spoiled, thoughtless adolescent. The surprise Austen gives us is that the catalyst responsible for Emma's development into a mature and intelligent young woman is not only the bad results of her meddling, but the care and concern of an older man. Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightely gives a great performance as the kind of male we might hope for in the lives of our daughters---especially if we have Emmas of our own. His timing is perfect, as we watch him urge her to take more care in her dealings with others,----- and especially to learn to distinguish true  intelligence (the farmer Robert Martin) from  superficial socialbility (the vicar, Mr. Elton). The acting of minor characters is outstanding , as we see the characters' strengths and weaknesses before Emma does.

Garai really played Emma brilliantly and softened the more annoying aspects of her book persona (don't get me wrong, I liked book Emma just fine) and while I found Miller a strange choice for Knightly at first, he really grew on me as the story went on.

In this entertaining Jane Austen adaptation, yes.

But first, Emma must interfere in the love-lives of several other people. (She's not the wisest of Austen heroines.) Then she must avoid choosing the wrong suitor, the unreliable Frank Churchill.

Lead actors Romola Garai (Emma) and Jonny Lee Miller (Knightley) make a lovely couple. Michael Gambon plays her anxious father, Mr. Woodhouse. Even in the smaller roles, the actors all give enjoyable performances.

(Also note that Jonny Lee Miller plays Sherlock Holmes on the American TV series, ""Elementary."")

This 2009 TV miniseries meets all the Austen requirements: 4 hours of beautiful scenery, beautiful costumes, and such beautiful houses on those great English estates.

However this week I picked it up again, and watched eps 1 through 4! This is the sort of drama that slowly crept up on me, and then completely drew me in.

I think Emma might be the worst match maker in history, but she is so likable with her bubbliness and naivety. Mr. Knightly was witty and wise. I liked the banter between Emma and Mr. Knightly, and how their relationship grew. I also liked all the major supporting characters, from poor Harriet (Emma was her match maker), to the mysterious Frank and sullen Jane, to Emmas lovable and overprotective father, amongst other good supporting characters. I also really liked how this drama unfolds like a relationship chart mystery, as Emma finds out how wrong her perceptions are.

3940534,5,B002KISB56,"Very strong production, lovey landscapes and scenery. This ""Emma"" takes considerable time to lay a solid foundation, going into detail to explain Emma's dislike of Jane and their jealousy of each other. The series also shows how children who were either orphaned or had lost a parent could be treated. The explanation of the roots of Mr. Woodhouse's hypochondria was also interesting. The production had some nice psychological depth, but having a few more of the most memorable quotes would have made it even more enjoyable for me. I missed them.

I liked Emma's portrayal and her faulty manners and shocked expressions. This whole work is about her lack of manners, her rudeness, her busybody-ness, her general decline in the company of Frank. Emma is cloistered, as this production takes great pains to show. She is neither by temperament nor association worldly or accomplished (though she is smart). She is also a snob, but not heartless. Her social faux-pas are quite entertaining to watch (when they are not painful) as is her transformation into a more conscious and better-mannered adult. Mr. Knightly's perfection in the face of her flaws is at times a bit much to take, but the age difference makes it more palatable though still strange, since he is sixteen years her senior. In a romance though, love is supposed to conquer all and smooth over everything with a happy, blind untroubled brush.",1496707200,7,1405,4.9787234042553195

3940536,5,B002KISB56,"I had seen the Gwyneth Paltrow version of ""Emma"" and the Kate Beckinsale version of ""Emma""; yet, I enjoyed this version too. It is different enough to make it interesting. Romala Garai, who plays Emma is quite likeable. She is the pretty, charming, talented, clever, friend, who meddles too much in the lives of the plain folk, who look up to her. Her father is overly worried about people getting ill; he will not let the children eat any of the cake that is on the table at a party, because it is not good for them. Most of the main characters are likeable; thus, you care about their losses or successes. On-location filming of pretty gardens, countryside, and large manor houses. Pretty costumes; horses and carriages. There is a married woman in Emma's social circle of the small village, who is a know-it-all giving unwanted advice.

3940539,5,B002KISB56,"Emma (2009) is a sumptuous production in many ways, one reason being its length and all the many details a longer production allows. Romola Garai had a special quality as Emma that no other actress has ever brought to this role. She really made me stop and think about the character on a number of occasions, especially the end of Episode 3 when she seems downright arrogant and lecturing as Mr. Knightley voices his suspicions about Frank. I hadnt realized how Emmas not just foolish or a bit ridiculousshes plain, bullheadedly WRONG in so many things and stubborn about ituntil I saw this version. The only reason it's a 4 for me is that the whole first episode was so, so boring, and the movie didn't really grab me until after Mr. Eltons proposal.

Romola Garai is wonderful as Emma - charming, beautiful, clever but with flaws. I did not expect Jonny Lee Miller to be such a wonderful Mr. Knightley - he is as dreamy as any Austen man can be (and that's saying a lot). Their chemistry is palpable, especially in the Highbury Ball scene (which I have seen at least 40 times in the last 3 days...cant stop!).

She seems much like an unsophisticated teenager rather than a mature lady.  Whether that works for you is a matter of taste.  For me, it's a bit jarring.",1493856000,,444,4.45679012345679

But BBC did excellent in this adaption just as the Pride and Prejudice adaption from BBC with Colin Firth and Jennifer Eile.  The only complaint I have of this is the ending when Knightly and Emma are at the seaside.  I know that Knightly is supposed to be overall expressionless and Johnny Lee Miller did wonderful portraying that, but couldn't he look even a LITTLE happier about marrying the love of his life and taking her to a place where her joy bubbled over?  He could've at least cracked a smile, put his arm around her or kissed her cheek; something to show he didn't regret his choice of a bride.  Other than that gripe it was beautiful.  Though I still can not bring myself to complete the reading of Emma.  Jane Austen said it right when she said that Emma was written as a heroine no one but her would like.

3940638,5,B002KISB56,"I thought nothing would outdo Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightly. I was wrong. Johnny Lee Miller is perfect in this role. The actress playing Emma is also fantastic - does a great job maturing over the course of the show, just as the character does. The setting and music were outstanding.

Didn't like how gloomy they directed Emma's father to be - he's supposed to be humorous not morose. Yes, some of the mannerisms and dialogue seemed a bit 21st century, but that did not detract from it at all to me.",1485302400,,501,4.445652173913044

I actually like the old BBC mini-series best, for all it's watery-look and sub-par production quality, because that one is the most faithful to the book.  I think this one is a bit better than the version with Paltrow, and I like it as much as the Beckinsale version.  Romola does a good job portraying Emma, and the narration in the opening scenes is helpful in adding background in case  you've not read the book.  This version is long enough to include a lot of the book's content.  They changed a few things around, but nothing major that would take away from the original story.  Definitely worth watching!",1484870400,2,659,4.629310344827586

3940739,5,B002KISB56,"Delightful - maybe not EXACTLY true to the novels - I get the general feeling that THIS Emma, if I asked her to go catch frogs with me down at the stream, would clap her hands and rush off to do so immediately.  The body language of the actress suggests a bit of an unreserved tomboy.  Still.  the characters are endearing, the actors do a great job, the setting is fantastic, events, characters, etc consistently make sense.  This is the first period production I've seen that actually communicated some delight when there was dancing.  Well done,.Emma.",1483401600,,554,4.729166666666667

3940762,3,B002KISB56,"I fell asleep trying to get through this several times so I'm really not liking this as much as I thought I would.  My greatest problem is with Emma.  She is simply way too ""goofy"" and not a properly brought up young lady of a certain rank.  Her manners are poor, she is way too bouncy/ jumpy - flinging herself down on chairs - she simply doesn't work at all in this.  Although, I generally like most everyone else I can still find problems with them all. Miss Bates is quite good - although I found her sounding more mean spirited in this - not someone who can't shut up.  I'm a little put off my Mr. Knightly - he just seems too young to be Mr. Knightly and not someone 12 years older.  Jane Fairfax is supposed to be a very reserved character and this one seems close to tears on a number of occasions.  I love the actor who plays Mr. Woodhouse and I've seen him do a terrific job in other period classics, he doesn't do well portraying the overly worried nature of Mr. Woodhouse. Mrs. Weston, however, is especially is lacking.  She is all washed out and uninspiring and she doesn't seem attached to Emma at all.  Emma is, by far, my biggest problem.  I think the A&E version with Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong is far superior.",1483056000,4,1234,4.280172413793103

3940776,5,B002KISB56,"Excellent production of Jane Austen's Emma. If you like Sense and Sensibility, or Pride and Prejudice, then you'll probably enjoy this re-telling of Austen's ""Emma."" I don't feel Emma is as sympathetic a main character as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, or Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. Those characters tend to come from more moderate circumstances, whereas Emma is a very wealthy young woman who likes to meddle in the love lives of others, until, of course, she meets her match. This production is from PBS, so it is much longer, with separate episodes, and has more detail than the movie version. Still, a delight.",1482624000,,614,4.970873786407767

3940817,2,B002KISB56,"The only JA movie from the last decade that wasn't just cheesy fluff, but it still is nowhere near the original intelligence and cutting wit of Jane Austen. More for the Mrs Gaskell crowd. Self conscious British accents, horrible costuming of Harriet, anachronistic dialogue. Franks story made more angsty-- there's an effort to use his adoption at a young age to excuse his irresponsible behavior to Emma and mean teasing of Jane. Which didn't impress me.
The main romance will work if you like Johnny Lee Miller and Romola Garai. Personally I felt Garai was a dorky version of Emma, and Miller comes across as a decent guy with a bad haircut, but not as classy as either of the other Mr Knightleys ( Mark Strong, Jeremy Northam).
Mr Elton I also found not very funny. There almost seemed an effort to make him more sexy.
Overall, watchable but not great.",1481500800,,856,4.675496688741722

3940819,4,B002KISB56,"This version of Emma is superb!  Romola Garai in the role of Emma is well-cast, but the character of Emma seems more adolescent than in other adaptions.  Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley is great - he plays the character with a good balance of seriousness and lightness so as to be believable.  Louise Dylan as Harriet Smith is good, but her role seems rather silly at some points - that is, she cries too much and is quite childish sometimes.  This version of Emma, as opposed to the version with Kate Beckinsale and the version with Gwyneth Paltrow, is my absolute favorite.  The script was well-written, and there are some subtle jokes that play along with Austen's wittiness and sarcasm.",1481414400,2,692,4.68595041322314

3940860,3,B002KISB56,"A superb cast with some exceptions. First, the character of Emma. She spends most of her time looking like a fish gulping air. Eyes wide and staring. Slightly clumsy and foolish. There is no hint of the sophistication that this is the most prestigious lady in the county. The diathermy of Hartfield. Perhaps that is the way she was supposed to be adapted? A schoolgirl foolish and immature. By this time in her life, though young she should have mastered the attitudes and character of her station in life. Instead we see her like a deer caught in the headlights. She seems all over the place. In her meetings with Mrs Elton, there was no putting forth of her social superiority. This always puzzled me about the relationship of Mrs Elton to the rest of the characters. She was after all only the wife of a clergyman. Who, as I understand it was way down on the pecking order of the social ladder. Here we see all the characters bowing to her foolishness, Emma in particular does nothing to put her in her place. In this adaptation we see her smiling going along with whatever Mrs Elton is saying. The second casting of Mrs. Weston I found very dull and lifeless. There was no chemistry between Mr Weston and even Emma. It was a washout of this character. The male cast was wonderful.
I will believe that the idea for this portrayal of Emma was some directors idea of Emma being a wide eyed teenager instead of the elegant lady that she has come known to be.",1480204800,6,1458,4.464419475655431

3940933,3,B002KISB56,"Have seen many versions of Emma, including the glammed-up Hollywood version with Gwyneth P, and this version starts out very strong, with the creative new twist of focusing on the two small children being sent away from their homes to live with strangers.  This is a very smart move inasmuch as the central 'misunderstanding' of the novel focuses on the adults these children become, and gives more emotional resonance to their actions.  It even makes Frank Churchill a more sympathetic character, tho' that may not have been Austen's intention.  That said, Romola Garai is a relatively weak Emma compared to others who have played the role, even American Gwyneth.  Garai seems to think that continual bulging eyes and giggles best denote Emma's immaturity, which of course they do, but they ring false -- these ticks do not fit in with the outward composure and 18th century manners that a gently-raised, wealthy member of the upper class would have displayed publicly. They made her governess look like a total failure and became very annoying. Sometimes felt I was watching a production of Grease, sans music, rather than an Austen production.  The other cast members, who were very good, played much more to traditional types and carried the film, which was lovely to look at. I'd recommend watching it if you love Austen and Emma the novel, but be prepared for the jarring acting style of Romola Garai.",1478217600,7,1407,4.944915254237288

3940949,5,B002KISB56,"In contrast to other Austen heroines, Emma seems immune to romantic attraction, at least until her final self-revelation concerning her true affections. Emma is an INTJ. INTJs, those who are classified as introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging by the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator, form the rarest combination of the basic traits identified by modern personality psychology. These individuals are described as difficult to understand or predict because they live by glaring contradictions and can simultaneously be the most starry-eyed idealists and the bitterest of cynics (16personalities.com). Emma Woodhouse, the title character of Jane Austens novel Emma, matches this description perfectly. Her pleasure in solitary reflection, focus on ideal dreams, preference for conscience pondering, and need for settled plans are all basic characteristics of an INTJ personality. Therefore, since Emma can be classified as the rarest and most enigmatic Myers-Briggs combination, it is no wonder that she is hailed as one of the most complex heroines in English literature. I am an INTJ and recognize myself in Emma's character. Thank you BBC for this wonderful depiction of the INTJ personality.",1477958400,,1202,5.758426966292135

3940964,5,B002KISB56,"Recently I had the pleasure of watching BBC's production of Emma. I enjoyed it greatly and wanted to tell you a bit about it! Also, if you have Amazon Prime you can watch it for free here!

Though I've not read the book by Jane Austen, I've read that the filmmakers made every effort to be true to the story. This newer version explained so much more than the earlier Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow (though I did enjoy this version as well!).

The story starts out when Emma Woodhouse is just a baby and gives a brief background through to when she is about sixteen. Her older sister marries a Mr. John Knightley. Emma fancies herself the one responsible for the alliance and decides that she has a knack for matchmaking. A few years pass and she decides to put her matchmaking skills to work once again and matches her governess with a local widower.

Now about twenty or so, Emma finds herself alone with her widowed father. She quickly finds a new friend, Harriet, and seeks to help the young lady refine her manners. Not to worry, she has a match in mind for her new friend! There is a young, handsome vicar, Mr. Elton, whom Emma believes will be a suitable husband.

Meanwhile, Emma's neighbor, Mr. George Knightley, visits Emma and her father frequently. He tries to encourage Emma to mind her business and not help others with her matchmaking skills. She does not appreciate his sensible counsel, but they are good friends.

Mr. Elton frequents Emma's house and showers attention on both Emma and her friend Harriet. Of course Emma is certain that this guarantees a proposal for Harriet and promises her friend that she will be moving into the vicarage within the year! Unfortunately, Mr. Elton has his sights set on Emma and poor Harriet gets her heart broken. Emma certainly does not return his interest and abruptly refuses his proposal.

Two locals, Emma's age, return for the first time since their childhood, Mr. Frank Churchill and Ms. Jane Fairfax. Jane is quiet and keeps to herself. It is said that since she doesn't come from any money she will have to seek employment as a governess. Frank is loud and boisterous, full of fun and mischief, not the definition of a gentleman.

Emma is attracted to Frank's fun-loving ways and the two get along famously. Unfortunately, Frank's behavior doesn't bring out the best in Emma. She forgets her manners and picks up on his foolishness. Mr. Knightley privately reprimands Emma and encourages her to be kind and remember her breeding. It is so interesting to see how Mr. Knightley seems to bring out Emma's better qualities, while Frank does not.

Emma's transformation from the beginning of the movie to the end is lovely to see. She earnestly desires to please her oldest and dearest friend, Mr. Knightley, and it is evident as she seeks to make amends for her past shortcomings. I do cringe for her when she makes a fool of herself along with Frank when the group of friends go to Box Hill for the day. Then she realizes what a mistake she's made and tries hard to make up for it. Again, she grows into more of a lady as she seeks to do better.

And then the end of the movie comes, and what better ending then Emma getting married?! If you know the story, then you know whom she marries. If you don't, then I do hate to spoil it for you! Just know that it does end happily and sweetly - the best way for any story to end!

I like watching the various  interpretations of Jane Austen's books. Of course they are never as ""good"" as the actual novels, but often worth watching. I think fans of ""Emma"" will like this series, and yes, probably have some quibbles here and there. (I thought the actress playing Miss Bates was too young for the role--I always picture Miss Bates as being older. And she was not annoying enough to deserve Emma's ridicule.  But I'm just nitpicking. Mr. George Knightley was a little too young, too, but again...just quibbling.) I recommend giving this series a try.",1474848000,,681,5.017699115044247

3941157,5,B002KISB56,"Enjoyed the freshness and sweetness of this 4-part series.  Wishing that other networks and online series creators would begin to find writers who can write with fresh eyes again.  This series brings out the cultural and economic conditions in Britain during a particular period of time.  It would be really refreshing if today's writers for television could have the wisdom to write with as much depth as writers wrote in the past (referring to the writing of Jane Austen here, and there are so many writers from the past who wrote with depth that is relatable to all people around the world ). However, I think it requires significant amounts of time in thoughtful, quiet reflection and openness and honesty of heart to be able to write that way.  We seem in such a rush ... hopefully, we can make a shift.  It would be really wonderful to be able to watch a bounty of programs that contain virtue and wisdom within their storylines.",1474588800,,935,4.676829268292683

3941159,5,B002KISB56,"Each TV or movie adaptation brings out new facets of the Austen novel. In this version, Emma comes across as young and immature, while still charming. I think the relationship with Harriet Smith is also more understandable here: Emma has always had a confidant in Miss Taylor, and Harriet becomes that confidant. Also, as attractive as Mark Strong is in the version of ""Emma"" with Kate Beckinsdale, the age disparity is very strong. That is not the case here, nor the growing physical and personal magnetism between Mr. Knightly and Emma. And while Mr. Knightly remains a grand landowner and the most important man in the county, Jonny Lee Miller portrays him as a regular habitu of the Woodhouse household. Altogether more relaxed.",1474588800,,732,4.959349593495935

3941185,5,B002KISB56,"The beautiful homes and estates provide a rich scenery that brings the story to life and make this film a feast for the eyes with the director making good use of the windows, doorways, etc. to showcase and contrast the characters. The screenwriter stays close to the original story, but begins with tender reflections of the different experiences of the three young children whose mothers die; the impact of this tragedy steers their lives in different directions until they meet again during their years of potential courtship. Secrets and social faux pas abound; a wonderfully done story reflecting the genius of Jane Austen's ability to create characters that reflect the virtues and failures of personal character development set against the social codes and classes of the late 1700s/early 1800s. Romola Garai is a delight as the playfully charming Emma in this coming-of-age classic.",1474156800,2,889,5.223776223776224
3941186,5,B002KISB56,"I love this series.  Jonny Lee Miller and Ramola Garai are just fantastic in their roles.  I find it much better than Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow.

I've seen so many adaptations that go with the easy, but incorrect, characterization of her as simply a spoiled brat that has an epiphany, but as written her character is so much more nuanced.  This version of the story is the only one I have seen that is able to capture her.  The other characters, the setting, and the interplay is also wonderful.",1473724800,,472,4.453488372093023

In the older one that I watched on vhs years ago I missed some of the plot bc it was difficult to follow and understand but I was able to put the pieces together by watching this one. Also think it's very cool that Jonny Miller plays Mr. Knightly, being a fan of his show Elementary. He plays such a different character role in this from that of Sherlock and it's pretty neat to see him in this role. Hats off to the actors and the production team!

3941251,4,B002KISB56,"I liked this. Romola Garai looks more like Emma to me than any other actress who has played her. And her Emma's personality is young, smart, proud, vivacious, a know-it-all, and open. We see her grow and we can see the good qualities she has that attract Mr. Knightley.
As she matures she will become a fine woman. This production generally follows the book. Most of the high points were there. Johnny Lee Miller played  Mr. Knightley well. I'm not sure I liked his portrayal any better then Jeremy Northram's in the1996 Gwyneth Paltrow Emma. He was just different. Kinder, perhaps.  In fact, in some ways I like that other version better. (Sophie Thompson, Miss Bates! Juliet Stevenson, Mrs. Elton! Phyllida Law, Mrs. Bates! Greta Scacchi, Mrs. Weston!) If I could combine elements from both those productions I think we would have the definitive Emma.

As it is, this is enjoyable to watch, even though it condensed some important elements of the story, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.",1473206400,2,992,4.755813953488372

3941312,5,B002KISB56,"5 stars ! Hi. My name is Peter William Benke. I wanna explain to you how I arrived at the five. However first I wanna say this. Anyone who can't foresee exactly what is going to happen here, based on literally the first 4 minutes of Emma, is just.. I don't know. Not smart. I watched this because I was on Ambien. But before you suddenly stop reading please, please just let me explain why. When I take Ambien, I don't sleep. I hallucinate, and that makes me feel the need to go back in time, to another world where castles and dragons once stood proudly- Sentinels of the realm, breathing fire and repelling 6 to 12 month strategic food store seiges. Emma.. It gets there. it does and I like it. Now, if your looking into this Victorian stuff... ''The Paradise'' is good. It's better then Emma but Emma in its own right, Is absolutely not unworthy of being checked off your off list. Ill tell you why. Here I go. There is a lady in a show- Her name is Elaine Cassidy. She is the Sole reason why I still exist to give you this guidance here from my apple computer that has a Retina display but no dvd drive, which I didn't know when I bought it and I was too lazy to return it. Elaine Cassidy is so intense and utterly gorgeous in every single everything, that she saved me from my happenstance - I was literally watching Emma and I was about to implode into a small but powerful black hole, which was about to suck my bedroom into my own face, followed by my family friends and my car. I believe that my dog Li Lu probably made it out. She's a fast dog. So anyway what happened with the black hole is that Elaine Cassidy, is so wacky yummy candy apples sex-muffin-hot that the singularity closed before my face was sucked through time. Unfortunately my legs were already on the other side. I could feel them walking but I didn't know where.. So look i'm going to be honest about this review. I only have 5 minutes or so left to live because again, my lower half has already gone through the breach and materialized on the other side many centuries from now, as a humanoid/shed hybrid, capable of walking around and also full of canned pears and peaches. And not much more. So while my opinion of Elaine Cassidy is super, lovely high... My review of Emma itself, or herself, may be biased because my face is the only thing still here in This, dimension. I'm using Dragon to write this review so don't whine abut possibilities, bla bla. I wanna say with my remaining time: If my x girlfriend Jennifer Cherbopolis ( The spelling of her name eludes me ) -was Elaine Cassidy, I would have touched her face like it was the Dali Lamma's golden journal, and Id have booked enormous suites in Prague and Munich and wherever, covering them with 5,000 different colored flowers, each, And of course written one or three piano pieces in honer of her Lips for Each, town, on the trip. I would also have worked out my pecks as much as necessary, and, I would offer in a very English way, to photograph her Underwater, which is what I do. I take pictures of people under, water. And unlike the X, I would hope she wouldn't make fun of me for wearing black shirts. Not like Jean Skirts Only is a fashion explosion either.. But whatever. So I think Emma is overall, pleasing and highly English. I give it 5 stars because i'm thinking about, Elaine Cassidy. She is, not in the show Emma. But that's not a problem for that particular show, right now. It's not good for it either, I suppose. Again Elaine Cassidy is staggering and Emma is a show here. Now It's time to face the music",1472256000,,3564,4.344827586206897

Beautifully photographed on location in southern England, wonderful music score by Samuel Sim, excellent casting, enjoyable performances by all. Some liberties were taken with the dialog from the book, but acceptable considering the writers were catering to the understanding of a TV audience. I loved the beginning of the series, which explains the situations faced by all three major characters as children. It makes the rest of the story about them as adults so much easier to follow and understand. The characters are presented more like real people than the usual stiff portrayals we've seen in other versions. I love this series and have watched it more than once. A credit to all involved..",1470528000,2,760,5.0396825396825395

She presented her in the only possible manner that could make sense. I realize the manners of that day might beg a different rendition of a lady in her social position,  but there is NOTHING in the book that offers it.

3941424,4,B002KISB56,"We really enjoyed this film. But it is quite slow and complicated with plot and character development. Not your fast moving action film. But the music is lovely, the settings and dress are delights. Emma is extremely well played, as is most of the supporting cast. A great film to watch on vacation. And pay attention at the beginning. That's when the background is set for the plot and character development. We've watched the film three times now and really enjoy it's beauty and meaning. Heartily recommend, but don't expect a fast-paced plot. Just a film that will draw you into another time and era in a very engrossing way.",1469232000,,629,4.7272727272727275

3941426,5,B002KISB56,"Worth a look.  This interpretation of Emma plays her as a pretty silly young thing through most of the film, which is a disappointment.  Why would Knightly even like this silly girl, let alone love her.  Also, the forgiveness of Frank Churchill by everyone is a bit hard to swallow as this actor plays him as a real user rather than someone foiled in love.  Still, not the worst Interpretation I've seen.  Perhaps I just watched because I love Austin!",1469232000,,451,4.5875

3941457,5,B002KISB56,"This is a charming take on Jane Austen's novel.  It is my favorite version of Emma, because of the cast.  Emma is charming, yet unaware.  Some other adaptations have Emma being more of a snob, more aloof.  In this BBC version, Emma is a young woman of a wealthy family who becomes self aware of her own capabilities and of her own heart as she takes on the running of the household once her sister and governess get married.  Mr. Knightley is played by Johnny Lee Miller (currently in ""Elementary"").  The series is done in 4 parts.  As I said, it is one of my favorite Emma movies due to the sets, costumes, cast, and charming characterizations.  If you re-watch the series, you will find Austen's hints at Emma's folly hidden in small clues left sprinkled along the way.",1468627200,,771,4.496402877697841

3941939,4,B002KISB56,"This version of Emma is decidedly more British in its sensibility than the 1996 movie version and far truer to the book and characters. It's well-acted and produced. It is something that you have to sit down and watch as opposed to the lighter, fluffier movie version. It's more Downton Abbey than Jane Austen in that regard.",1464307200,,325,4.719298245614035
3941940,5,B002KISB56,"I cannot say I am an expert on TV productions and movies of Jane Austen's books, but I did read all of her books and watch almost all of the movie and TV adaptations; and I must say this for me is the loveliest adaptation of Emma or any of her books.  Enchanting acting by the Emma actress and others.  I even fell in love with the Harriet character.  Very, very believable in every way.  The Emma actress should be proud of her performance in this piece; just brilliantly natural and tender acting on her part.",1464134400,,511,4.291666666666667

3941947,5,B002KISB56,I've seen this movie 3 times now and I'll see it again soon.  It never fails to enchant me.  Emma's maturning in a different world from mine nevertheless spans the years effortlessly to engage my sympathy and interest.  It's one for the ages!,1463961600,,242,4.5813953488372094
3941948,5,B002KISB56,"Excellent. The lead actress and actor superb. All actors/actresses great. A great script, excellent adaptation of the novel. Wonderful costume drama.  And not a long-term commtment, it's 4 or 5 hours total. I highly recommend.",1463961600,,226,5.457142857142857
3941949,4,B002KISB56,Emma has a decent storyline but ithe is a little slow in conveyance. Acting is very good.,1463961600,,89,4.294117647058823

3941951,5,B002KISB56,This was a surprisingly great story with numerous unforeseen twists and turns. The acting was also quite remarkable at times. On the downside the viewing resolution was just adequate at best.,1463875200,,191,5.193548387096774
3941952,4,B002KISB56,"The first two episodes were not great; it took me a while to accept Romola Garai's performance, but by the end of the series I was very impressed. Overall, it is well worth the time.",1463788800,,182,4.228571428571429

3941956,3,B002KISB56,"Oh, how I wanted to love this version.  Just couldn't.  As a Jane Austen purist, this film just didn't do anything for me.  The characters and their motivations were muddy.  I didn't understand them.  The chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightly?  None.  Additionally, I must concur with other reviews that found the anachronistic mannerisms by the main character disruptive.  However, with all the faults of the acting and screenplay, the soundtrack was simply beautiful.",1463443200,,471,5.27027027027027

3941958,4,B002KISB56,"This is by far the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, and the best version of Emma as well.  The sunny youthfulness of Emma and the endearing relationship with Mr. Knightly come forward beautifully.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  The costumes, the casting, the score, all beautifully and unified whole.  The scene settings, the stately homes, matched my idea of the book completely.  Excellent chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightly of any film adaptation of a novel I've seen.  Highly recommend.",1463184000,2,516,5.083333333333333

3941977,5,B002KISB56,"I really love that Emma is flawed. She is normal, even relatable to girls of this age in that she does make mistakes, and she isn't perfect. This was a great show, and a great companion to the book.",1462665600,,198,4.102564102564102

3941982,5,B002KISB56,"I didn't know what to expect because I've never read a Jane Austen (?) novel. It was an exceptional movie with a true to life theme plot.

3942050,5,B002KISB56,I have seen many adaptations of Jane Austens's novels but this was by far the most enjoyable. Romola Garai's portrayal of Emma was just as I imagined her to be after reading the book many times.  She was able to capture Emma's enthusiasm and playfulnees The scenery and settings  were lovely. I truly enjoyed it and since I was sorry that it ended I will have to watch it again.,1461283200,,378,4.385714285714286

3942055,4,B002KISB56,"Great adaptation of Emma, gets 4 stars partly because no one can top Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightly, and also because Romolai Garai can play Emma a bit too immature at times. Michael Gannon a gem as usual.",1461283200,,205,4.421052631578948

3942075,4,B002KISB56,Enjoyed the show although having thoroughly enjoyed the book I had a much better feeling for the characters. My companion wasn't as enthusiastic about the characters and hadn't read the book.  Not anywhere as enjoyable as A&E's Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters.,1461024000,,271,5.159090909090909
3942076,5,B002KISB56,"Love this edition! It's beautifully directed, lit, staged, costumed, and acted. Ok, there is some Anachronistic behavior on the part of Emma, especially, but the sweetness of the performance carries it off.",1461024000,,206,5.46875

3942091,5,B002KISB56,I love this movie so much!  It's a beautiful period tale of a pushy young woman who does her best to help others with varying degrees of success.  I got it at the library and watched it several times.  I wasn't ready to return it after I'd renewed it the maximum number of times so I figured I should own it.

3942140,5,B002KISB56,"Of all the versions of EMMA, this is the only version that I will watch. I love all of the characters and Emma is so dang conceited and prideful that her ""coming to herself"" moment is a lovely moment of self-awareness and of course, she falls for Mr. Knightly. The cinematography is outright gorgeous and the film score is perfect. Every actor is perfect in his or her role. Worth the 4 hours!",1457136000,,393,4.397260273972603
3942141,5,B002KISB56,"Having seen Jonny Lee Miller cast as Sherlock Holmes before seeing this version of Emma, I was enthralled to see how very handsome and alluring Miller can really be.  In fact, it makes me rather sad that he took the role of Sherlock!  He is so diminished in that role to me.  In any case, I loved this mini-series.  The BBC does everything right, it seems.  I so wish we had an equivalent company in the United States!  Whenever I see that the BBC has created a series, I can rest assured that I am in for a quality treat.  I had recently watched the Gwenyth Paltrow version of the book, Emma, and was completely appalled.  After writing a scathing review for that movie, I read through other reviews where this version was mentioned.  What a happy coincidence for me!  I am quite sure that Austen meant this book to be both enlightening and entertaining at the same time.  This rendition of the classic has both lightheartedness and moments of deep sentiment- indeed, it captured the true love between our heroine and hero very well without coming off as fake or ham fisted.  I enjoyed the music, costumes and the settings.  Another thing I tend to enjoy about BBC productions is the method of the filming.  I am no expert, but English filming is somehow 'earthier' than American productions.  We must use a different type film that is brighter and more colorful somehow.  English shows are filmed with a more subtle color palette that is very easy on the eye.  It seems to match the slower lifestyle of the period, somehow.  In any case, I like it better.  If you were disappointed by Paltrow's, ""Emma,"", you will be refreshed by this one starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller- oh!  and don't forget the guest appearances of Michael Gambon every now and again!",1456790400,12,1767,4.584664536741214

3942155,5,B002KISB56,"Very worthwhile watching!  It's a mini series, not a movie, so it's longer than the famous movie with Hugh Grant. The main character is more bouncy and less ""lady of the manor"" than Gwen's portrayal in the other movie, but if you watch any of the videos on the making of this movie, they were intentional in making the characters more ""modern"" - not wanting to faithfully replicate historical accuracy in dress or mannerisms. That's intentional.  So given that, it's a movie worth watching for it's own sake and it's own adaptation and interpretation of Jane Austen's novel.",1453248000,,574,4.846938775510204

I agree with the vast number of people who love this adaptation of Jane Austin's work and bought the Blu-ray version as a Christmas gift for a friend who also loves the DVD version.  I had noted the Spanish origin and, being in the USA, hesitated buying it. The entire cover is written in Spanish AND clearly says ""Region 2"". Since this was to be a present I decided to try playing it on my SONY Blu-ray player, which recently had the software updated. The unit would not recognize the disc format and play.

3942216,4,B002KISB56,"I'm just biased when it comes to Romola Garai.  I love her interpretation, the choices she makes in how to deliver lines, etc.  I didn't even like ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Atonement"" or ""Vanity Fair"" but watched it all just to watch her at work.  (I even sat through ""Dirty Dancing 2"".)  She's fantastic.  I still think that, if she had been Elizabeth Bennet in the 2005 film ""Pride & Prejudice"", she might have given Jennifer Ehle a run for her money; she's got those same mischievous, teasing eyes without stepping outside the bounds of propriety.

This ""Emma"" perhaps isn't as Austen-esque as some of the earlier ones; some elements did make me wonder.  But Garai's Emma is magnetic.  She's not as dopey as Gwyneth Paltrow's and more sympathetic than Beckinsale's (although the latter was great at Emma's haughtier side).  Garai's Emma can be too modern at times (the scene where she bursts into Knightley's study, crying), but she's fun anyway.  Her facial expression when Emma learns that Elton praised Harriet's horrible painting is spot-on: it really sells not only Emma's understanding of art (that Harriet's a terrible artist) but also her genuine belief that Elton must love Harriet.  The actress also brilliantly carries off Emma's thoughtlessness, and it's not hard to believe she could be cruel without in the slightest bit meaning to be so.  Her remorse after her inadvertent callousness is always genuine, and her cheeky comment at her first ""official"" meeting with Churchill (making reference to having run into him earlier on the road) is delivered with arch sweetness.  Garai is fantastic and really makes the adaptation work.

Anne Weston is done by the highly underrated Jodhi May; I've seen her as the younger daughter in ""Last of the Mohicans,"" then in ""Daniel Deronda"" - as Garai's romantic rival!, and in an earlier version of the non-Hollywood ""Boleyn Girl"" as the conniving Anne Boleyn, and now here as Anne Weston, and she carries off each completely brilliantly.  In general, I'm amazed by both Garai and May - they slip from the competitive equals role in ""Deronda"" to mentor/child ""Emma"" relationship just seamlessly.

Christina Cole is great as Mrs. Elton.  Having seen her brilliant turn as Blanche Ingram in the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson ""Jane Eyre"", I was curious to see her do a Blanche-like role in much lighter fare, and Cole just nails it.  She's got that haughtiness for the role, but she gets the comic timing just right to show Mrs. Elton's silliness.  Lovely job.

The two men in Emma's life do well enough: they're not not Colin-Firth-as-Darcy great, but nice nonetheless.  Jonny Lee Miller was good enough.  He's a brilliant actor and pairs well with Garai, and he has some hilariously comical moments (like tucking his napkin into his collar) that give this ""Emma"" adaptation some levity.  I have to admit his Knightley is softer than I imagined; I always thought Mark Strong and Jeremy Northam fit what I'd thought of Knightley.  As for Dad, I didn't mind Gambon, who goes from a cheeky, politically saavy older ally to Garai's onscreen husband in ""Amazing Grace"" to Garai's sweet but nutty father.  He's not particularly memorable, but I just found this Mr. Woodhouse interesting as a gentle but fretful old man, whereas many Mr. Woodhouses are often more cranky curmudgeon than sweet worrier.  Perhaps not the most memorable portrayals of Austen men, but nowhere near the worst.

Some welcome touches: (1) the opening montage, showing Emma and Jane and Frank as small children.  It really sets up the rest of the story.  (2) the very loving relationship between John Knightley and Emma--they really feel like actual in-laws.",1442188800,2,3674,4.967266775777414

The image is quite good, although not so much at the very beginning of the first episode.

I definitely recommend this movie to any of the classics lovers out there.",1434844800,,588,4.258928571428571

3942300,4,B002KISB56,"A brilliant production, quite simply.

The casting could not be better and the art direction is superb: from the costumes to a display of period desserts, the demeanour of country aristocrats on a strawberry-picking party, to the mansions (interiors and exteriors, both), eveything is not just in the demonstration class but, as far as this scripting of Austen's novel goes, quite unsurpassable. Anachronistic liberties may have been taken with the whooping while dancing, the ladies' marked lack of stiffness (no poise, some might say), and the lead's unrelenting forthrighness throughout ...although I could be dead wrong about these.

The casting is especially felicitous. Although her photo on the DVD cover did not entice, the curiously-named Romola Garai is outstanding and seemed born for this part: fresh and outgoing, charming but not mawkish, pretty yet not beautiful, crafty tho' outsmarted, she helps immensely in turning out one of the best BBC period productions ever--including those that helped propel the substantial careers of Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh ""Blinky"" Grant and Colin Firth.

The rest of the cast also does very well, as usual for BBC productions: also the blushing variety of young ladies, chatterbox governesses, opinionated, out-of-touch gentlemen (Gambon), and younger, tolerant ones, as well as the borderline cads--all are played flawlessly by this (probably RADA) cast.

Even the undramatic denouement was apt, fitting, refreshing. This is Austen, after all, so not ingratiating or amenable to splashiness at the close.

If there's one shortcoming--and one must strain to find any--it's that the marvellous Michael Gambon, in charm and talent equalled in our era only by Maggie Smith, is not exactly wasted in this but is underutilized. Still, he plays his small part to perfection, as usual.

If you like this kind of thing, you will probably love this particular one.

3942313,5,B002KISB56,"After watching the movie with Paltrow/Northam in the leads I didn't think I needed to see another version, as that one was simply superb.  But I have to admit that this one with Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller is superior.  Gywneth Paltrow nails the classy aristocratic side of Emma, but Romola gets closer to the heart of her.  This is a heroine who doesn't know much about herself and who dismisses marriage as being of little interest at at time when it was just about all young women thought about.  This attitude lends her a certain distinction.  We do believe she is above the romantic fray, but are also aware of her youth, inexperience, and vulnerability in contrast to her own self-confidence and socially prominent position.  In watching the Romola/Miller version recently, I felt more conscious of this quality of vulnerability..  Ms. Paltrow is charming, certainly, and her intelligence comes through as well.  But Ms. Garai finds a simplicity in this character that enhances the impact of her self-discovery.  Also, Johnny Miller comes off as more sincere -- not quite as clever as Jeremy Northam -- but ultimately more endearing.  Both versions are terrific, but if you are interested in warmth, the mini-series wins.",1433721600,,1234,4.975609756097561

As she matures in the fourth episode, she's likeable, considerate, and not so giddy, smiley, and completely immature like she is in the middle episodes. I love the ending.

3942420,5,B002KISB56,"My daughters and I have been fans of Jane Austen movies for years, and this is probably my personal favorite.  Not just because the story line is entertaining and the casting is great, but because this is (in my humble opinion) the funniest of them all.  I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Emma -- Romola Garai is just perfect!  The other BBC Jane Austen movies are great, but this one is so very appealing -- it doesn't have the mild conflict that some of the others do.  Now some amount of conflict is usually necessary to make a movie / book / story interesting . . . and it isn't that this movie is dull in any way.  I guess one could say that there is a bit of conflicting emotions and situations in Emma, too -- but it's just different somehow.  Much more lighthearted, and you don't have the feeling that maybe nothing is EVER going to work out for everyone.  If you like clean ""girl movies"" that you can watch with your daughters (and daughter-in-laws) without an apology of any kind, get this.  You owe it to yourself.  And if you haven't ever seen a really clean and pure and funny ""girl movie"", you just don't know what you're missing.  Makes you wish, at least in some ways, that the world was still like this.

My future daughter -in-law has seen the other version, and likes this one better. We are having so much fun watching it together!",1421712000,2,1361,4.339920948616601

3942504,5,B002KISB56,"This is now my number 1 adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. The modern adaptation is still Clueless. Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller are perfect as the two lead characters. I profess Jane Austen is such a terrific writer  that every time it is turned into a movie, important scenes in the story had to be omitted. As such, a four-part series is the perfect answer to Emma. Although I like Toni Collette as Harriett in the movie version, this series packs a power cast with Michael Gambon, Jodhi May and Robert Bathurst. Dan Fredenburgh was excellent as the sharp but impatient John Knightley and Christina Cole portrayed the annoying Mrs. Elton to a T.",1419120000,,652,4.6695652173913045

Romola Garai can not be beat in Amazing Grace and Daniel Deronda.",1418860800,,345,4.2615384615384615

If you want to take a story and turn it into something it isn't because you think you can improve on the original text, don't have the audacity to  use the same title. Better yet, if you are not creative enough to come up with your own story all together, just don't try! that being said, I love this rendition of Emma. There are some changes, but they do not take away from the story, and they give you a deeper sense of a few characters. I love Johnny Lee Miller and think he gave the best performance as Mr. Knightly I have seen yet. Romola Garai also does a knock-out job, and the supporting cast is excellent.

Jane Austin's books rely too much on ""comedy of manners"" to ignore manners in any adaptation. There is no way to update them. The only way to serve the material is to preserve the formality. It's a pity, because I find this cast very likable. The older versions tend to get the necessary formality right, even if lacking in production values.",1417737600,,488,4.433333333333334

To me Emma Thompson's portrayal of ""Emma"" is completely different from Drew Barrymore's. which is what makes each dramatization worth seeing.  Check them both out, you will  not be dissipointed. I first fell in love with Jane Austin's gifts as a writer at Millsaps College where i minored in English Lit.  Millsaps is a small, very much acclaimed school, in Jackson , Mississippi. The irony is that Jane Austin never found the happiness of marriage in real life except in her mind and writing skills which produced her stories which into the endless future past the more than 200 years the y have lived.

3942608,3,B002KISB56,"I love the novel, and I truly wanted to be impressed with this adaptation, but I found there were two major problems which couldn't readily be overlooked: firstly, that Romola Garai is woefully miscast as Emma.  In her comportment, speech, conduct, and facial expressions, Ms. Garai exhibits a total want of elegance and decorum.  I believe that Gwyneth Paltrow, in the Miramax adaptation, had at least been more accurate in her depiction of most of Emma's mannerisms.  Secondly, this adaptation completely dropped the ball on the ending!  Without spoiling the plot, I consider that the outcome of Harriet Smith's storyline was totally unexplained; this marred what was, overall, a reasonably faithful rendering of the novel's events.",1416355200,,734,5.301724137931035

In the true version the hero is more than 10 years older than Emma, (I don't remember the exact age difference, I think 15 years).  He loves her but because of his age difference doesn't come forward until the end, since he thinks he's too old for her.  Also they do squabble but not constantly. This drastically changes the tone of the story so much that  it is someone else's, not Jane Austen's.

I found it totally refreshing that the actors were not your usual well known faces although some are familiar enough to give it a comfortable feel.

3942679,5,B002KISB56,"I don't often write reviews but this movie was so well done I have to make an exception. I have read this book numerous times and I have to say they have ALL the characters exactly right. It was so true to the book, yet it made the story come to life in a way that really shows the story to its full merit. You would never have to read the book to get the same story line exactly as it was intended. To have the grumpy old father so well played and still likeable, Knightly so noble, Emma so perfectly portrayed. I can't find a flaw with this movie. Even Jane was just right. Cleary the director was a big Jane Austin fan. I will always picture these same actors if I ever read the book again, but I would probably just watch the movie instead. It was that good.",1412899200,,762,4.052980132450331

I had only seen the movie starring Gweneth Paltrow where they had to condense the whole story into a mere 2 hours! Where with this one we had 4 hours, what a bonus!!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this BBC mini series!!! The casting was, in my opinion, fabulous! All the characters rightly placed in the hands of well deserved actors! I have seen Romola Garai and Johdi May in Daniel Deronda and loved them in that and in the same i loved them in this! I personally think that one can never go wrong with Jonny Lee Miller as the male lead! I mean c'mon! Scrumptious i say! :) And with other great actors like Michael Gambon and Robert Bathurst it was sure to be a good one! Once again saying that it was well cast!!! I love the story of course and to see the journey that Emma takes throughout the 4 episodes and many months that we see! It just makes me want to live in her time or even live in her shoes!

The length made it perfect for a TV 'escape' on a day off or short enough that one is not likely to forget what the last episode held. Jane Austen continues to be well read and acted out over the decades due to her astute observations on the nature and personality of the human race.  One knows the main characters will eventually see their 'true nature', but the observer has no idea when or how.  I was quite delighted with this presentation of 'Emma' and grateful it was available through Prime at no extra charge.  Good choices, Amazon! *****",1412294400,,683,4.6115702479338845

3942739,5,B002KISB56,"At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is easily one of my very favorite adaptations of any classic novel, and I've enjoyed (and sometimes suffered through!) quite a few :) It manages to adhere very faithfully to Jane Austen's early 19th century novel without feeling even remotely stiff or 'dated'. Like its titular heroine and the actress who plays her, this version of Emma is vibrant, spirited and lively. It's heartfelt and sweetly romantic without being the least bit sappy, and it's clever and witty without being the least bit silly. It's deliciously frothy, spirit-boosting fun, but there are actually more sneakily profound insights into life, love and human nature than the original book or these movies are generally given credit for.

Knightley is my personal favorite of all of Austen's (or, for that matter, other authors'!) heroes, and as much as I loved and appreciated Jeremy Northam's depiction, Johnny Lee Miller blew my Knightley-adoring mind with how perfectly he captured the character and his friendship-turned-romance with Emma. Romola Garai, meanwhile, seems born to play the spirited and eminently delightful Emma, who's my favorite of Austen's heroines because she's such an endearing, compelling mixture of both strengths and flaws. Emma's growth into a more thoughtful and mature woman throughout the film is realistically subtle but a delight to behold. The supporting characters are uniformly well written and perfectly cast. Even the ones who got comparatively little screentime proved memorable for me.

Everything about this movie is just so smile-eliciting and beautiful: the scenery, the costumes, the music, the characterizations, the actors, and the overall spirit. If I could keep only a handful of my many DVDs, this would be among them. My only regret is that I didn't discover it before now!",1409529600,2,1836,5.284246575342466
3942740,5,B002KISB56,"Oh, Emma, Emma.  So young and certain, she nearly missed it all.  Garai is a wonderful and believable Emma.

3942743,4,B002KISB56,"This is a very good version of Emma that's fairly true to the book, unlike the Gwyneth Paltrow version, in which she is shaking her curls a little too much for me. This Emma is properly conceited, but also properly tender-hearted and conscious of her obligations. The other characters, particularly Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, are nicely realized, and I like this Mr. Knightley best of all those I have seen. The sets and costumes are accurate and lovely to look at, and I'm pleased that there has been no addition of ""passionate"" scenes to titillate modern viewers who do not have the proper understanding of Miss Austen's works and think they are intended to be romantic, rather than satiric. Overall, highly recommended.",1409356800,,733,4.919354838709677

In this newer version, Romola Garai is a brilliant Emma. She embraced the role and in every aspect, became Emma. When I re-read the book, her portrayal will be my vision of Emma. As for Jonny Lee Miller, (the reason I purchased this in the first place) stellar performance. Without speaking, he portrays every feeling and thought of Mr. Knightley.

3942784,5,B002KISB56,"This is my favorite adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. I very much enjoyed the backstory of the way Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax were sent away while Emma and Isabella were kept home. That really was an eye opener for me in the rendition of the story. Very moving, even with repeated viewings.

Romola Garai is a terrific Emma. Spirited, pretty but not unbelievably so, she carries herself with perfection. Jonny Lee Miller is a wonderful Knightley, bringing his experience and wisdom to a role that needs it. I enjoyed getting to see him in London with his brother and Isabella as well as gauging his mood by how he held his mouth. A great job for the role.

Altogether well worth the time. I know I've indulged in this movie more than once and will undoubtedly watch it many more times.",1407628800,,791,4.563380281690141

Although they couldn't understand every word or laugh at every subtlety, they really enjoyed it and were able to understand the story through other forms of expression (body language, facial expression, music, etc.).

And yes, I am a longtime Austin fan and though this version was not as traditional as others, it was positively delicious in its own right.

3942824,2,B002KISB56,"If you're a fan of Emma, skip this adaptation. It's interestingbefore I watched this version, I read an article about it. The article talked about how the production lost over a million viewers after the airing of the first episode. The author hypothesized that perhaps the reason it failed was that people were becoming tired of period pieces, and that people were simply bored of the stories and the time period. I, however, think that was not the case, but that this production truly suffered from a grand mistake on the casting department's part. I say the show lost viewers because casting made the misstep of giving us Miss Romola Garai as our leading lady.

Miss Garai was an extremely poor casting choice. She did not capture the true cleverness and wit that Emma has, nor did she behave with the high-bred mannerisms that would have been expected of a young gentlelady in that time. This Emma was far too modern. She ran and squealed; she slouched and yelled; she jumped on couches and made dramatic shows of emotionscomplete with 21st-century-bratty-teenager eye rolls, shoulder shrugs, scoffs, and whines. Her accent slipped at times into casual, lower-class British. For one particular moment, I was shocked because she sounded almost cockney to me. One could practically see her as the lowly farm girls she was so scared of associating herself with. As an actress, I also found Miss Garai to be far too 'showy'. It seemed she was constantly playing to the camera and overacting, instead of honestly communicating with her scene partners. Her performance struck me as very amateur.

If I were to recommend a film adaptation of Emma, it would be the 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow version. While Paltrow's accent is sometimes shaky, she still captures the class, mannerisms, quick-thinking, and genuine concern for her friends that Emma has. Miss Paltrow plays an Emma we root for and come to adore.",1405814400,2,1900,4.934375

Delightful and lovely are the two words that aptly describe this gorgeous show.  The main actress is absolutely perfect for Emma!  She is beautiful, sweet, innocent, and yet so lively and vivacious you want to get annoyed with her poking her nose in everybody's business but can't help but love her.  Mr. Knightley also was so grandiously played - seriously, Austen must have a secret power of knowing what every girl wants in a man - valiant, kind, gentle, witty...Every single character (including that headmaster of Hogwarts!) were very well casted and the ensemble just made it so easy to watch.  I will do a comparison and say that this really is far superior to Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma.  I also want to point out that this show was kinder to the non-British audience and didn't throw us off guard with the fast-talking British style of conversation.

3942875,5,B002KISB56,I love all of Jane Austen's books and the movies that have been made from her books. Emma is played by Gweneth Paltrow and she does a great job. Emma thinks of herself as a matchmaker and she tries to persuade her friend Harriet not to marry the farmer who is interested in her. I highly recommend Emma.,1402444800,,303,4.241379310344827

But, I enjoy how this one brings out more of the story and background happenings than the Paltrow movie.  It is a little slower of a pace, but not agonizingly slow.  I even like some of the casting better in this one than the better known Paltrow movie.  Very well done!",1402272000,,400,4.351351351351352

My six year old daughter loved having girl time and watching it too.  Family friendly.  Unlike one of the other version, Mr. Knightly is not a troll, nor is he so hot that you wonder why she never thought of a romantic relationship with him.  Overall, very enjoyable film.",1402012800,,437,4.6103896103896105

3942884,5,B002KISB56,"We first saw this version right after it aired in Great Britain.  It was a miniseries and we loved every episode.  We are big Jane Austen fans and had seen several versions of Emma previously, but Romola Garai is delightful as Emma and we enjoy Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley.  Michael Gambon as Mr. Woodhouse is a treasure, ""Oh, no!  Not cake!""  Tamsin Greig is wonderful as Miss Bates.

This is an excellent version of Emma and one not to be missed!",1401926400,,454,4.409638554216867

3942889,4,B002KISB56,Emma's character was a little too modern and her manners more like a person from lower society. Jonny Lee Miller was excellent and that is why I rated this 4 stars and not 3.,1401408000,,174,4.147058823529412

3942891,5,B002KISB56,"After falling in love with the Colin Firth-Jennifer Ehle version of Pride and Prejudice, I started on a search of other Jane Austen works that would come anywhere close to the integrity of that wonderful work. I thought I would never find anything worth while. They all seemed so insipid, or stiff, or amateurish. Maybe a couple of characters would be OK, but the others impossible. Or the costumes and scenery so appalling, that I couldn't bear to watch. This beautiful adaptation was free with Amazon Prime, so I checked it out. After watching it once, I ordered the DVD, then watched it on instant video again. It is beautifully done. The characters make you care. This is the first Emma I've found, not only bearable, but lovable. This Mr. Knightly is wonderful. Not how I pictured him reading the book, but warm and lovable. The love scenes are beautifully done. Finally! A Mr. Knightly that meets my expectations, and an Emma that seems worthy of the name!

I need to add a comment on the wonderful music. I love it so much! I found the soundtrack, but postponed the purchase for now. I'll just play the movie in the background, when I want the music!",1401062400,2,1157,4.616504854368932
3942892,5,B002KISB56,"I'd been looking for a mini-series version of this book-and once again the BBC delivered! Emma-well played by Mz Garai,is silly and thoughtful all at once. As she moves through life,witnessing the joys-and heartbreaks-of others she realizes she is no matchmaker-nor even a great judge of character-but Mr Knightley helps her find her way-Emma finally realizes the only heart she needs to examine is her own-This series,I feel is close to the book-you're given more time to notice the sub plots and see the characters develop than you ever could in a 2 hr film. True to BBC form,the costumes are wonderful-the locations sumptuous-you are easily transported to Austen's era. Forget the films-watch this-the lovely ending will make your heart soar",1400976000,,744,5.1570247933884295

Their chemistry is amazing!  The rest of the cast is great too.  In my  opinion, in the Kate Beckinsale version, Knightly was too mean, he never smiled, and did not act like he loved Emma at all until he proposed.  In the Gwyneth version, he wasn't critical enough of her. This one get's Knightly right.  And like the book, it is both hilarious and incredibly sweet.

3942901,5,B002KISB56,"As a big fan of Jane Austen, I get tired of watching the Hollywood versions of her books because they add so much ""artistic license"" to their movies.  I find that the BBC knows how to take Jane Austen and translate it into a modern story without changing it.  Emma is no exception.  Romola Garai is perfect as Emma.  She has such an infectious personality that you root for her despite all her flaws.  Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightly is wonderful!  He is so good, that I find that I can't pick between him and Mr. Darcy.  That says a lot.  Michael Gambon as Emma's father is perfect.  In the novel, you know that he has some ""issues"" but Mr. Gambon makes you feel bad for him, all the while pitying him. If you love Jane Austen, you will like this.",1400544000,,749,4.21830985915493

3942916,5,B002KISB56,"This version of Jane Austen's classic gets it right.

Romola Garai is a delightful Emma -- portraying her sympathetically as both the rather naive, sheltered and indulged young woman who is looking for something to occupy her time, as well as capturing the genuinely warm and affectionate side of Emma that is behind her misguided but well-intentioned match-making attempts but that also makes her so appealing.

Jonny Lee Miller is also well cast as Mr Knightly, striking the right balance between being the protective older brother-in-law, used to guiding a willful child, and a man falling in love with the adult Emma -- a caring young woman who, despite her light-hearted playfulness, takes his guidance to heart and her responsibilities for others seriously.

Finally, the series is beautifully shot and the pacing of the story works well despite being broken up into three episodes.",1399334400,2,888,5.152777777777778

Laura Pyper, however, was an excellent Jane Fairfax, and had a plausible on-line chemistry with Rupert Evans as Frank Churchill though that part was really down-played.

3942980,1,B002KISB56,"I didn't feel that this production was true to Emma as Austen intended her to be. Romola Garai was a terrible Emma. She simply flops around, and basically demeans herself by flopping, rolling her eyes, and acting completely out of character for a young women of the early 1800s. (Yes, Emma was supposed to be completely unselfaware, but she was a highborn daughter of a gentleman who was supposed to have delightful manners. It also bugged me that she keeps being cast as a blonde when it was so clear that Austen intended her to be dark haired. I feel someone like Michelle Dockery would have made a wonderful Emma.
The production does not stay true to very much of the Austen dialogue and it fails to deliver the lighthearted whit of the novel.
Jonny Lee Miler, I thought was far too close in age to Emma to be a respectable Mr. Knightly (remember he is 16 years her senior... or approximately 37). He was also a bit too soft... I thought that perhaps he should have been a bit more stern, consider, he is supposed to be raising a wife.
The one redeeming factor of this production is the chemistry between Frank Churchhill and Emma, which was well done.",1395273600,5,1155,4.504761904761905

She got on my nerves.  But I think middle-school or high-school age girls would like this movie just fine.  It's a good little romance for them to watch.  This version is a good one.  Picture quality and sound are great.  Some of the outdoor scenery is beautiful.  For my taste, it's ok but not great.",1395187200,,471,4.333333333333333
3942984,4,B002KISB56,"It is very well done.  This version of ""Emma"" gives the audience more of a glimpse into the life of Emma Woodhouse than the 1996 version, and allows you to get to know some of the characters a little better, such as Mr. Woodhouse (who is played by Michael Gambon), Jane Fairfax, Frank Churchill, John Knightley, and Emma's sister, Isabella.  I love the chemistry between Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam from the 1996 version.  They will always be my favorite.  But the cast in this version is also fantastic.

3943003,3,B002KISB56,"My two favorite Austen Novels are Pride and Prejudice, and Emma, so I tend to be *very* picky about their screen adaptations. When I compared this version to Gwyneth Paltro's version, I was astonished to discover that I found it far inferior in many aspects. Usually BBC adaptations are vastly superior to anything Hollywood puts out. Don't get me wrong, the ability to dig deeper into the subplots and characters in the novels are a great thing, but somehow, the lighthearted satirical spirit that so categorizes Austen's style became mean-spirited, and too dark. The Bates' who are supposed to make you laugh, instead make you cry.

While Jane Austen admitted that Emma was a girl ""no-one but myself would much like"" I think writer and director took it too literally. Emma was *not* very likeable at all! Ms. Garai, displayed very little of the sweetness, and vulnerability that made you root for Emma to begin with. I also felt like she had none of the elegance and decorum that a woman of her class is expected to have. I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltro, but she managed to have both in spades. It felt like she was always shouting her dialogue whether she raised her voice or not.

I also found myself deeply disappointed with the costumes, and some of the sets (the ballroom in particular) when Harriet Smith and Jane Fairfax are both dressed better than Emma Woodhouse, something isn't ringing true.

However, there were also very good parts that I did enjoy... Mr. Lee-Miller's portrayal of Mr. Knightly was very well done, despite my issues with the adaptation from the book to the script. I thoroughly enjoyed Harriet Smith, when I usually don't. Kudos to Ms. Louise Dylan for making her so charming. I also enjoyed that we got to see the conflict and pain in Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax's courtship, (even though I adore Ewan McGregor and Polly Walker more). Thankfully, the mini-series afforded the time to delve into John and Isabella Knightly, and their children too.

All in all, in spite of what I disliked I think it's great to get to see these marvelous adaptations on Amazon Prime.",1394323200,,2103,4.7534246575342465

3943010,5,B002KISB56,"As many before me have said (even Austen herself), I have always found Emma a tad difficult to enjoy/understand. I've read the book and watched the Gwyneth Paltrow adaptation of Emma and still I found her difficult to wrap my mind around and why Austen liked her. But this adaptation really shined a light, I think, or at least I had a light bulb moment when she first argues with Mr. Knightley about not wanting Harriet to settle for Robert Martin. And Romola Garai absolutely SELLS IT 100% with the kind of feminist passion that Elizabeth Bennet would cheer for herself. Emma truly believes Harriet deserves to not settle (even though we know she's not settling in the end) despite her situation. Knowing that Emma posses this passion, instead of just toying with matchmaking as the previous adaptations have made it seem really rounds out Emma as a character. It also makes her comments towards Mrs. Bates at the picnic all the more shameful and disappointing to Knightley (and to us as observers). Johnny Lee Miller is a wonderful Knightley and he doesn't hold back his disappointment, sometimes too harsh and other times right on target. We can see his lifelong friendship shapes his expectations of Emma and he plays it so well. And realizing his own feelings for her is done so subtlety but shown so clearly that it's no wonder Emma doesn't realize her own feelings until much later. Seriously a masterpiece of an adaptation. This will make you a fan of Emma if you weren't already and will be a tough one to ever out-do in the future.",1393891200,,1542,4.693726937269373

And Mr. Knightley, quiet, mature, and adorable as a puppy (which is a complement if a woman says it - which I am) was a wonderful contrast to the flighty, bubbly nature of Emma.

3943020,5,B002KISB56,"I don't agree with what the other reviews said about the 1972 version, which I do have.  I thought it quite good five stars also.  Concerning Miss Bates she is played by a older actress, more the age of the mother than daughter.  I saw this version on TV and even though it did not have a lot of the words that Jane Austen wrote I still give it five stars.  Romola Carai is a excellant Emma.  And Miss Bates is played by actress who is the right age Miss Bates is supposed to be in the novel.  Someday I will get this version.  This is a very close second to the 1972 version. For those of you who don't have either version and are thinking of purchasing one of them, which ever one you do get, you won't be disappointed.",1393545600,,721,4.070921985815603

3943027,4,B002KISB56,"I wasn't sure I would like this ""Emma"" since the movie version has long been a favorite, but I eventually came to enjoy it quite a bit. At first, I thought Romola Garai was too exuberant, too prone to flouncing to be Emma, but her performance grew on me. And at first, I thought Jonny Lee Miller was too young looking to be Mr. Knightley, but I thought he did a fine job with it. Even though I still prefer Jeremy Northam's version of the part, it's hard to find fault with any miniseries that lets you stare at Jonny Lee Miller for several hours. (I would also argue that Jodhi May is too young looking to be Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, but that's just quibbling.) Overall, I appreciated that this version was, in many ways, more faithful to the book's plot than the movie is--for instance, there's no doubt that the Dixon fantasy begins with Emma rather than Frank Churchill, and I loved that in this version, Mr. Knightley stops himself from kissing Emma's hand before he leaves for London. Overall, it's a very enjoyable program.",1393286400,,1030,4.543010752688172

I think they failed to grasp that what make Jane Austen's work so loveable is her use of language and the emotional depth she gives her characters.

3943056,1,B002KISB56,"I have been reading Austen for 45 years and had delayed seeing this version of Emma having been horrified by Kate Beckensale earlier (not to mention the butchering of Mansfield Park into a ludicrous feminist farce). I recently watched Romola Garai in The Hour about BBC TV in the 50s so I gave this a shot. Awful, just awful. I agree with other commenters that Ms. Garai mugs for the camera, rolls her big eyes, slouches, throws herself about in a sloppy, hammy performance. IHer governess Miss Taylor, played well by Jodhi May who was quite memorable in the The Aristocrats from 1999 (I wonder why it is only available on VHS--which was based on a real family--the Lennox sisters and starring also Julian Fellowes in his acting days) is wonderful here but hasn't a chance to shine given the part. I admit the physical appeal of Ms. Garai, but she wasn't very good in The Hour either. I usually think the Brits immune to the charms of mere physical beauty without elegance/style/intelligence but clearly she will go far regardless of her scenery mastication. And the screenplay does rinse out all subtlety and cleverness that was in the book. Back in Gwyneth Paltrow's youth I thought she barely pulled off the plummy English accent, but by comparison, she was at the height of her powers. Plus this version lacks the amazing Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton. Poor Michael Gambon, an incredibly gifted performer, the best in every scene...trapped in this dreck. Sorry Austen fans.

The characters in the Paltrow/Northam version were much too silly and Paltrow was too unsympathetic for me to care if she got Knightly or not. Garai and Miller were believable, sympathetic, with much more complex emotional tension. The secondary characters weren't caricatures of Austen's extended ""family"" of characters.

**I wanted to remind viewers that the version carried by Amazon Prime Instant Videos is the PBS version which for some reason had several parts edited out. The edited parts, I believe added a lot of back story to the characters. I can't understand why they chose to edit what I consider important context.

Its depiction of Miss and Mrs. Bates was outstanding. And, of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley were superbly written and acted.

However, after watching it a few times I felt there were some scenes missing, and so compared it to the DVD version.  One key missing scene is about 4-5 minutes long immediately following the proposal, where, sitting on a bench outdoors, they explain when they each first realized they were in love with the other.  That scene contains one of my favorite lines of the movie - Emma starts to mention that she had been talking to Harriet and Mr. Knightly, smiling, says ""OK, I don't care what we talk about, we can talk about Harriet if you want to"" :)  Shame to know there are missing scenes in this version.

I've seen a few different versions of Jane Austin's Emma before, and it's a good thing they are all so much different.  Yes, the story is the same, but the script writing, scene variances, actors, and director's point of view make quite a bit of difference.  The only thing I've never fully understood, after watching the opening scenes twice, and seeing other versions of Emma, is what happened with the kids being adopted, and the reasons why???  Maybe I get too distracted to pay close enough attention, but I wished I understood the dynamics of how and why these kids were let go by their parents.

I have two of the previous versions with Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and I liked them both for different reasons but this version is my favorite. I know some reviewers don't like Romola Garai's portrayal of Emma as they thought it was too modern and I can see why they thought that but isn't Emma supposed to be sort of spoiled? I am 26% through the book and that is the message I have gotten so far..loveable but spoiled. Her posture did bother me a bit as I think Emma would not have had a slouch otherwise I enjoyed Romola's performance. She is more animated than Kate or Gwyneth. I really do like all these versions, it is interesting to see how close and different they are from each other and the book..now that I am 26% into it :)  I am enjoying the book too. I know most of the lines so well they are like old friends and I can choose which actor is saying them..in my head.",1388620800,,1011,4.158163265306122

With 4 hours as compared to 2 it was more thorough and an excellent retelling of a great story, but, of course, lacked some of my favorite aspects of the other film. It has a very different feel so the jury's still out as to a favorite. However, I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to any Jane Austen fan.",1388448000,,396,4.142857142857143

3943151,5,B002KISB56,"I was first introduced to Jane Austen when my college roommate, an English major, announced it was 'the perfect novel'.  When I finally read EMMA after college, the book puzzled me.  Nothing seems to happen but conversation, picnics, the occasional dance and more conversation. Austen's works has none of the drama of JANE EYRE, for example.  After reading more of Austen's works, I realized that was the lifestyle for upper society, and that is interesting in itself.  So, the enjoyment of EMMA is in its subtleties.

In this story you have something unusual for the time: Emma, a heroine who doesn't have to marry.  She already runs a household for her widowed father and has the means to not work as a governess.  Meals are cooked, the fires are made and the door is answered by invisible others.  As a bright, outgoing, confident young woman - or slightly 'spoiled' as the character Mr. Knightley describes her, Emma (Romola Garai) is itching for something to do.  She likes managing things and tells Knightley (Johnny Lee Miller), she is intuitive about people.  She will manage marriages she decides, something she's good at she thinks, even though she isn't interested in marriage for herself.  She's never been in love, she says, and wonders if she could fall for someone.

In this film, Emma is played forthrightly by Romola Garai as a modern heroine.  She sits curled up on the sofa in one scene, and laughs with ease.  She doesn't seem to worry about 1800's decorum, perhaps because her place is assured in local society hierarchy, and it's innate to her by now so she knows how far she can go.  Then there's Knightley, who Johnny Lee Miller plays as a kind of 'still waters runs deep', who grows on you and Emma during the film. He tells Emma if she's gone too far. He perceptively challenges Emma on some of her ideas and activities.

Emma's father (Michael Gambon) is a doting, fussbudget who keeps Emma close and doesn't want her to marry and leave him.  The interesting thing about the story of Emma is the friendship Emma has with Knightley, even though he is 16 years her senior.  They speak directly to each other; there is none of the subterfuge and coquettery between the sexes.  They argue, they joke, they speak plainly to each other.  All of this is captured quite well in the film.

As Emma tries to manage the affairs of others' hearts, her plans often go awry which perhaps is Austen's point.  The heart cannot be ruled by the head, even Emma's.  Although her head told her she would never marry and couldn't fall in love, her head is wrong.  As usual in Austen's novels, there are ancillary characters who add humor and zest to the scenes.  In this case, there's the impetuous Frank Weston, the enigmatic Jane Fairfax, the foolish Minister Elton and his insufferable wife.  Their peculiarities spice up the action.  The sets are lovely of the homes of the characters.  Emma's dresses were rather boring, I thought, and not as flattering as they might be.  But perhaps the everyday dresses during this time were rather plain.

This is an enchanting enactment of Austen's novel and brings out its subtle charm.  The story of EMMA doesn't have the romantic tension of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as Emma is clueless to Knightley's feelings, and doesn't seem to know she has any of her own for much of the story.  But you admire her independence and willingness to not be conventional.  This four-part adaptation of the novel does the story a pretty and lively justice.",1388275200,2,3485,4.716887417218543

3943153,5,B002KISB56,The BBC version of this story is fantastic!  Because it is in 4 parts they are able to really delve into the Austen story instead of gloss over interesting character development that many Hollywood films are forced to do to keep the film under a certain length.

The rapport between Emma and Mr. Knightly is lovely - very realistic, Garai's Emma has youth's enthusiasm and privilege's arrogance to instruct others, but still be adorable, while Miller's condescension and exasperation barely mask his affection for her. You cannot help but smile at their bantering and a lot of it is due to his genuine frustration at, but patient tolerance for, her actions.  Michael Gambon's portrayal as the fear-filled father is delightful.  It might be flying into the face of tradition, but Mr. Knightly is quickly passing Mr. Darcy as my favorite Austen romantic hero.",1385769600,,734,5.049586776859504

3943179,5,B002KISB56,"I told myself I'd watch one episode of this show, since it was available on Prime and I needed something to enjoy as a brief study break, and I ended up watching it all the way through until two in the morning. I have previously enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow version of ""Emma,"" and while that film had great chemistry between Paltrow and Jeremy Northam, this version really captured the varied relationships that underpin the story.

The casting was delightful. Romola Garai, who I have loved on ""The Hour,"" is an inspired choice for Emma. I agree with another reviewer that she is perhaps a bit more modernly skewed than other versions of Emma, but the actress' face was so expressive that you could really see every surprise, delight, and frustration that Emma is experiencing. I saw that another reviewer criticized Jonny Lee Miller's age as Knightley, but I was so impressed by his chemistry with Garai that it was hard to be distracted by that fact. Indeed, while I enjoyed the Paltrow/Northam dynamic in the earlier film, the BBC miniseries makes it clear that Emma and Knightley are truly attracted to each other. The supporting cast was equally lovely, and the cinematography was tremendously well-done.

My only complaint, and it is a small one, is the tonal shift that occurred in the third episode. The director suddenly began favoring voice-overs, for example. I do not usually notice these things, so the fact that it actually stood out to me suggests a slight inconsistency in the storytelling. Indeed, there were a few points where shots seemed almost exactly like those employed in ""Clueless"" (the movie starring Alicia Silverstone that updates ""Emma"" to upscale California in the 90s).

The complaints are few. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and may buy a copy for my shelf, just in case, for I know that I'll want to watch it again. I am a big fan of BBC miniseries--""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""North & South"" are well-loved DVDs on my shelf--but I especially enjoyed the tone of ""Emma,"" which was a bit lighter and more ""fun"" than those heavier subjects.",1385078400,,2070,4.825352112676057

3943187,5,B002KISB56,"Nice detail on the subtleties of the story: her father's phobias, Miss smith's simpleness, Miss Bates' tragedies - which contributed to her nervous habits.
And the heroine, herself more realistically told with youthfulness and navet that Miss Austen intended us to feel, by her own description:
Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""[1] In the very first sentence she introduces the title character as ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich."" Emma, however, is also rather spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray.",1384473600,,772,5.336065573770492

Mr. Knightly was a little young, especially considering how much older he is than Emma in the book.
Mr. Woodhouse was played PERFECTLY. By far the best depiction of this character I have seen yet, it was spot on.
Mr. Elton wasn't nearly creepy enough and seemed much for remorseful about his choice in a wife than I expected.

3943235,5,B002KISB56,I ran into this on amazon instant and absolutely loved it. It is a great version of Jane Austen's work and I was sad that it was only four episodes. It's funny and serious at the right times and it's appropriate for all age groups. Will watch again.,1379116800,,249,4.208333333333333
3943236,5,B002KISB56,I really enjoyed this version of Emma. Followed the storyline as it should have. I will probably watch it again.,1379030400,,112,4.65

3943240,5,B002KISB56,I love this version of Jane Austen's book Emma. BBC does amazing work with their shows. The story is enjoyable,1378252800,,110,4.55

3943242,4,B002KISB56,"I liked this one so much I immediately went looking for season two, but  I could not find it, there are so many other great things to watch, I haven't taken the time to research it. Overall I thought it was a very good show, maybe a little short?",1378252800,,246,4.020408163265306
3943243,5,B002KISB56,"""Janeites"" (those who practice ""the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her"") have criticized this version of ""Emma"" because it doesn't match their idealized version of the manners and mannerisms of an 18th century young lady; the screen play doesn't exactly match the sequence of scenes in the book, etc.

However, I am NOT a Janeite, and as with any cinematic interpretation of a beloved novel, I appreciate the art and creativity that goes into bringing the printed word into the multi-dimensional world of the movie screen. Romola Garai, Jonny Lee Miller, and Michael Gambon are wonderfully cast as Emma, Mr. Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley. Though Romola plays a rather more modern version of Emma with her perky, chatty and meddling ways, she is nonetheless delightful and lovable in spite of her character's matchmaking flaws.

The costumes are bright and vivid, more so than other vintage interpretations of Austen; the sets in the manor houses and inns of the nearby town are well decorated and handsome with period detail, and the music adds a subtle but memorable punctuation to so many of the scenes. The outdoor scenes are simply stunning, offering a glimpse of the gorgeous grounds of the stately manor homes during all seasons.

The many scenes between Emma and Mr. Knightley are well acted, and it is entertaining and fun to watch their relationship develop. This is a first class production, one that perhaps even Ms. Austen herself would be pleased to see brought to the screen - if she had even been able to imagine such a thing !",1378166400,2,1588,4.962406015037594
3943244,5,B002KISB56,"Beautiful adaptation of the classic novel. Excellent choice of actors, made the characters very real. Emma was really charming, the best I've seen in this role in my opinion. Enjoyed with my family though my 9 years old got lost in all those marriages  :)",1377907200,,255,4.666666666666667
3943245,5,B002KISB56,I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the book.  It was beautifully done and I felt there was a wonderful chemistry among the cast.  Would happily watch it again and again.,1377734400,,174,4.766666666666667
3943246,5,B002KISB56,"The look and feel of this version is authentically Austen. Everything from the acting to the costumes, pacing to the score was excellent.  I adored Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightly, and I didn't think anyone would match Jeremy Northam's performance, but I would call them equal.  Romola Garai is lovely in the title role; The rest of the cast turned in strong performances.  I don't think it will disappoint, but judge for yourself!",1377734400,,432,4.8108108108108105
3943247,5,B002KISB56,This version is well done and holds true to the book. I can highly recommend watching this version of Emma.,1377648000,,107,4.4
3943248,5,B002KISB56,"I loved the Gwynyth Paltrow version so was reluctant to spend any time on another version, but this was amazing. Johnny Lee Miller IS Mr. Knightley and Romola Garai was fantastic as Emma. Obviously this one is much truer to the book since they have more time. Everything about it is top notch.",1377648000,,293,4.547169811320755
3943249,5,B002KISB56,"This Emma has had great reviews, but, this Emma is not as Ms. Austen presented  her, so it seems.  Kate Beckinsale did Emma as close to the book as is possible, but, if you want another version,, this one is very good, just be ready for the differences.  Mr. Knightley in this version is also played with less authority, though he is very likeable.  Again, the Kate Beckinsale Mr. Knightley is just as in the story.

It is now March 2014, and I have watched this EMMA again and I LOVED it!!! Just wanted you all to know.  Also, I re-watched Kate Beckinsale's Emma, and Gywneth Paltrow's Emma, and while those actors did excellent work with what was given to them to work with, it was very noticeable that much of the story was not developed nearly as much as Ms. Garai's Emma.  So now,  Roma Garai's Emma is my complete favorite.  I love her portrayal, her spunkiness and all.  Also, Mr. Knightley is wonderfully done as real, caring, compassionate, and truly loving his friend, Emma, and wanting the best for her.  He is not perpetually upset and angry as in the Beckinsale version.  So do enjoy!!",1377561600,,1098,4.517766497461929

3943257,5,B002KISB56,There are several versions of Emma but this one blows the others away!  Romola Garai [Amazing Grace] is one of my favorites! If you love British Period drama then this is time well spent.,1376956800,,187,4.5
3943258,5,B002KISB56,"This is a great rendition of an old classic novel!  Unlike other ""Emma's"" I have seen, this one gives more history in the beginning which is better for the overall understanding of the story line.  It was well don't and pretty to watch!",1376784000,,236,4.465116279069767

3943261,5,B002KISB56,I wish someone would create something like this for today! Jane Austen was an amazing author and this movie depicts her book so well! I very much enjoyed watching it. I wished it were longer! Definitely my favorite version of Emma.,1376524800,,231,4.658536585365853

3943264,3,B002KISB56,It's a good period romance but I didn't sympathize with the protagonist. That's no one's fault and it was an entertaining way to spend the weekend anyway. Wouldn't watch again but would recommend to a hungry Austen fan.,1376438400,,219,4.7894736842105265
3943265,4,B002KISB56,This is a nice adaptation of Emma. Some new aspects that are not part a previous versions that help make it distinct.,1376438400,,117,4.363636363636363

3943269,5,B002KISB56,"This miniseries is well crafted, with balanced dosing of levity and gravity so as to enrich and refresh the viewer.

The story accomplishes what few stories do: it explores the imperfections of the main character without adopting a cynical view or forsaking highlighting the needed principles which will elevate and enrich their life.  The story makes sure that both flawed notions and noble understandings are present and realistically included.  The characters are well rounded and appealing, being imperfect but not intolerable, and most in fact admirable.  Such a hopeful narrative brings delight to anyone who pursues valuable qualities such as graciousness, consideration, and human dignity.

I could only wish that there were more stories of this type, and told with such understanding.

The actors, costumes, and sets are likewise thoroughly enjoyable.",1376092800,,860,5.526717557251908

Don't think that I disliked watching it though! I actually adored this overall and think that all the actors/actresses did a splendid job. Definitely will watch it again. A must see!

P.S. I loved the ""daydreaming"" sequences and also agree with the other reviewers that the dancing scene between Mr. Knightley & Emma is divine!",1374624000,,495,4.963855421686747

3943288,5,B002KISB56,"This is an exceptional, full-length adaptation of Austen's classic. What is especially good about this version is that the lead actress shows an astute understanding of the title character. Emma is a silly, over-indulged girl raised by an ambitious governess and a self-involved elderly father. Emma is a busybody without sufficient information to take on the responsibilities she imposes on herself. That said she has neither guile nor ill-will toward any of her victims. No doubt this is why she is beloved by so many especially Mr. Knightly, portrayed here by Johnny Lee Miller who makes up for being a tad too young in the role with his intelligent interpretation. To date this is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen. Romola Garai is just about perfect as a funny, scatterbrained, spectacularly beautiful Emma.",1374624000,,821,5.088888888888889

3943290,5,B002KISB56,Johnny lee miller gives a dashing performance as knightley in this much more extensive version of Emma that blew the Gwen Paltrow version away. The settings are wonderful and vast in a small corner of the world where Emma exists. In all it gave a sense of what it was like to grow up in with too much time on your hands and not enough real life to focus excess energy on. Emma was so busy trying to fill her boring free time up with romantic whims that she almost missed out on the true love of her life.,1374364800,,504,4.101010101010101

Emma was always a favorite Jane Austen book of mine but I think it might have been influenced by my initial love of Clueless (no judging). This BBC version was able to cover so much more than the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and the acting was great.  The two leads, Knightly & Emma, were amazing and their interactions throughout the series were so simple yet sweet. It was exactly what I was hoping for when I clicked play. Previous versions of Emma made me wonder how they could fill 4 episodes but each episode flies by and you feel like you learn and understand the characters so much more than with the movies.

Garai is not Emma - she doesn't come across as a woman of the era or as a vivacious and romantic matchmaker who would attract Mr. Knightly - the essence of the story.  There are credible performances by other actors but none match favorably with their counterparts in the McGrath version.  Skip it.,1369785600,,407,4.771428571428571

3943357,5,B002KISB56,"what i especially liked about this version of emma is that every nuance of the book is developed.  this is impossible in a movie.  this version was done for british tv and had four long segments. no prior version has brought out so well emma holed up in the country with her hypochondriac father and kind governess.  her father cannot bear for her to travel so emma must amuse herself with the people in the neighborhood, her dolls and these two adults.  hers is a privileged existence but she cannot grow in this stifling atmosphere.

unfortunately, she carries into her young adult life all the things she used to do as a child to amuse herself. seeing the people around her as bigger versions of her dolls and her imaginary world, she sets herself up as a matchmaker.  she has initial success with her governess and her sister.  this goes to her head and she spins straight into disaster with their successors whose lives she tries to manage.

mr knightley. played by the wonderful jonny lee miller, is her neighbor and also the person who tries to bring her to her senses.  this also brings them into one another's notice as romantic interests for the first time.

there are great comic characters throughout too.  my favorite was Mr. elton, the preacher.  somehow austen's vicars are always great comic characters. emma mismanages him completely as one of her bridegroom dolls for a protege.  austen also loved invalids and this time it is emma's father who fits the bill. he worries about his health endlessly.  and then there is mrs. bates, who talks constantly and drives emma bats.

i also really liked the gwyneth paltrow-jeremy northan version of emma but that had the shortened length working against it.  if you want the full emma from the page, this is that version.

Romola Garai portrays a good Emma.  She's stared in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Dancing-Havana-Nights/dp/B00023BLXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights</a>.  Romola can portray naive innocence and cheerfulness attitude with the perfect amount of matchmaker busy-body attitude.  I think Romola is a perfect match for Emma.

Johnny Lee Miller plays a perfect Mr. Knightly.  He's more known for his acting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trainspotting/dp/B0057ZAA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trainspotting</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hackers/dp/6305047456/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hackers</a>.

It frustrates me to read because of the constant bickering, page after page after page.  I've read it, but not without throwing it across the room in frustration many times over.  This movie-version makes the bickering fun and pleasant.  I enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow version, too, but not nearly as much as this Romola Garai version.  This Romola Garai was so much more true to how Austen wrote Emma.  This is my go-to Emma.  Absolutely loved it.",1365033600,,547,4.6947368421052635

3943389,5,B002KISB56,"I gave this DVD series five stars because of its outstanding cast, beautiful cinematography and excellent adaptation of Jane Austin's book.  I really can't say enough about the cast - Romola Garai's portrayal of Emma as a youthfully confidant, meddling, but well-meaning character was so endearing it was easy to forgive her arrogant view that she knew what was best for her friends and family.  The character of Mr. Knightly was brilliantly played by Jonny  Lee Miller - always a delight to watch. He captured the essence of a man who loved deeply, but not blindly.  And Michael Gambon, who is a consummate actor, made a character that is often played as a self-centered, whining, complaining father to be a man deeply hurt and damaged by the death of his young wife - shaping his personality by the fear of losing his precious daughters.

The historical houses, the stunning wardrobe and the beautiful landscapes contributed to make this a truly beautiful production.  I would highly recommend this set of DVDs for any Jane Austin fan or just someone who loves a good romance.",1365033600,,1078,4.863387978142076
3943390,3,B002KISB56,that is just it.  I really don't have very much to say about this little saga.  It is just ok.,1364947200,,94,3.65
3943391,3,B002KISB56,"I wanted to like this, was jazzed to have another Emma to view, and also enjoyed the reviews of obviously sincere and discerning folks who liked it so much.  Unfortunately, there was a lot I personally found distracting.  Spoilers follow.  As other critics pointed out, Emma's facial expressions read so modern, and so smack of spoiled teen drama queen, that I found it off-putting.  I noticed she often has her mouth hanging open, which struck me as something someone of that era, at least a cultured young woman, would not likely evince.  She reminded me of a rebellious teen in the style of a young Hayley Mills- all that was missing was a wad of bubble gum.  Also, in a couple of scenes her hair was teased and tousled looking, not in keeping with the period.

The flouncing around on furniture that other critics mentioned didn't bother me that much, though.  And I must say I admired much of the direction, the enlarged view of the grounds, the surroundings, the rooms, very well done and provided a sense of being there, a vivid sense of time and place.  Great locale shots of people walking, riding horses, etc.  I also liked the script's and Gambon's characterization of Mr. Woodhouse, probably the best I've seen, he's more complex and sympathetic, less of a caricature than in other versions.  Ditto with Miss Bates.  Similarly, I liked the script's opening focus on young Jane and Frank being taken from their homes, while little Emma stayed with her father.

I also liked Miss Smith.  But the other characters, not so much.  I felt most of them were lacking, pale, insipid in comparison to other characterizations.  Jane Fairfax a great beauty and talent?  Hardly.  Mr. Churchill a charismatic hunk?  NOT.  The governess, far too young.  Mr. Weston wimpy, for some reason.  And Jonny Lee Miller, interesting, engaging, yes, commanding, no, not dashing leading man material, not here, not for me, anyway.  I've liked all of these actors elsewhere, I'm not sure why they suffered here, likely a combination of the script and the direction.  For example, I thought the ""Badly done!"" scene was decidedly ho-hum.  But I liked the picnic scene before it, thought it well-done, dramatic.  And Romola Garai was certainly charismatic, able to cultivate viewers' interest and sympathy- just so out of keeping with JA most of the time I had trouble getting past it.  In some scenes she is truer to JA, for example, in the carriage scene in which she rebuffs Mr. Elton, her demeanor more befitted a young woman of her station.

Anyway, I give this three stars because I thought, as a standalone film, not compared to the book and other films, it was entertaining and engaging, due to JA's plot and its accessibility, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the time and place.  Also, Garai is charismatic, commands the screen.  And even though I think the production suffers in comparison to others, I think it's definitely worth seeing, to round out one's Emma experience.

Though I think the Paltrow/Northam version is light years better, for my money the Beckinsale/Strong production is the quintessential Emma, by far the best version yet made, both in terms of being true to the book and in being the most romantic, dramatic, with the best-drawn characterizations  (in that version, for example, Frank really IS an impudent dog and Jane is competition indeed for jealous Emma.  And Samantha Morton is great, as always).  If you haven't seen it, do.

And BTW, if you haven't seen the 2004 BBC production of North and South, I thought it FANTASTIC, so poignant, romantic, both heroine and hero WONDERFUL and complex (I just saw it, watched it for free on Prime and immediately ordered the DVD).  It's not frothy, no comedy of manners, it's a drama, slower-moving but portent with meaning, existential, life or death issues, the tension between values in southern and northern England, and those of the moneyed vs the working class.  Also about the love within families, between friends, within our human family, just wonderful.  I loved it SO much I downloaded the kindle version of the book (published 1854) by Elizabeth Gaskell, which I also adored.  Sort of like Jane Austen (less scathing wit, more vision and heart) plus the Industrial Revolution and a social consciousness.  And SO romantic- ""every age is the same, it's only love that makes ANY of them bearable..."" (to borrow a line from Malcolm McDowell in Time After Time).  I also downloaded the evocative, haunting musical theme (links below).

She was less snobbish and I got a sense of her immaturity more so than her arrogance! It was entertaining and light! All the characters were done pretty well.

I disagree with another review that says she does not exhibit the manners of her time and society. She was well-mannered with a jovial spunk. It shows that even though her status required decorum, there was room for individual personality. And the character was not meant to be perfect, along with the society she represents with its presumed superiority (not always superior but arrogant in thinking so).  It was beautifully done.",1362873600,,600,5.05050505050505

3943414,5,B002KISB56,"This is by far the best adaptation of Emma I have seen.  Kudos to director, Jim O'Hanlon and well done, BBC. A casting coup with Romola Garai as Emma and Jonny Lee Miller as Mr Knightley.
Emma is the most whimsical of Austen's heroines with the exception of Marianne Dashwood.  But where she could have come across as a spoilt, matchmaking heiress, Romola plays someone who errs on judgment but is always able to stand up and make amends. She brings a vulnerability and loneliness to Emma that makes you root for her till the end.
Jonny Lee Miller executes Knightley with aplomb and I didn't think I would say this, but he rivals Colin Firth's Darcy by bringing in a perfect balance of inscrutability, firmness and kindness.
A great supporting cast, a tight screenplay, breathtaking cinematography and updated costumes.
Austen would be proud.",1362614400,,842,4.840277777777778

3943424,5,B002KISB56,"There are many, many good things in this Emma. A very fine and varied screenplay that moves along in a leisurely fashion while focusing on character. Generally excellent acting, with neither Mr. Woodhouse nor Miss Bates played for humor (though I do admit considerable enjoyment of Prunella Scales' turn as Miss Bates in Thompson's version). Clever casting: Mrs. Elton is the only blonde aside from Emma, thus emphasizing in physical appearance as well, the likenesses in personality that develop an immediate antipathy in the latter for the Vicar's new wife.

We get plenty of Stately Georgian Manor views, inside and out. Some brief but effective glances of the life lived outside the wealthy set's bubble--which mirrors Austen's own treatment. A judicious selection of dialog. Strong costuming. Direction that is usually invisible, but occasionally partakes in the wit--as in the visual spin-and-snap when the plans for a quiet outing are twice taken over and regimented by Mrs. Elton. Two of the three dances we see are authentic (and they're the best), and the dancing itself is spot-on; and having met my future wife many years ago at a Celtic dancing society where we both were members, I have a small bit of knowledge about that.

Of course, some things are changed, but that's only to be expected, given modern sensibilities. Emma is much more forthcoming in expressing her affection and concern to Miss Bates the morning after insulting her, where Austen is very restrained. And we're never shown Emma withdrawing from Harriet in the film the way ever-class-conscious Austen has her do so in the book, signifying her displeasure with crossing class lines. But there are none of the character rewrites one finds, for example, in the most recent Mansfield Park. There's fidelity to the characters, and that's a very good thing to those who value Austen's ability to create believable personalities that fit within their culture.

The things I don't like are few, but deserve to be mentioned. First, Romola Garai, while a fine actress, is completely of the 20th/21st century in her gestures, facial expressions, and movements. She stands out all the more in that the rest of the cast displays a finer understanding of the appropriate style.

Second, there's a judicious amount of Romantic/Impressionistic musical wash that's completely alien to Austen. I guess it's to be expected in a comedy of manners that, to interest our times, also must be a modern romance. This will probably bother almost no one save me, and as I already wrote, there's some good popular dance music of a folk variety as shown. It's also great to see and hear the actual actresses of Emma and Jane Fairfax sing: a decent amateur and a moderate one. Instead of the professionals overdubbing as was the case in Thompson's Emma.

Third, the cleanliness of it all.  The women visit the outdoor market on market day, and there's no dust, grime, dirt, etc. The entire group go to take the view on a stifling day at Box Hill: nobody sweats, and all the clothes are neat.  Harriet is knocked down by the gypsy boys: when she's brought back to the Woodhouse estate by Frank, the only evidence of this is the tiniest smudge of grime near one eye. It's as though the whole place had a squad of Laundering Nazis dusting, vacuuming, and otherwise tidying up everybody and everything 24/7.

But those are my only complaints. This is far more authentic to character and depth than Thompson's version, which I still enjoy a good deal. And I can make allowances for Garai. If 4 1/2 stars were possible, I'd give them, but since I can't, my objections aren't sufficient to really knock off a star. This is the Emma to get.",1362096000,,3686,4.876996805111821

3943435,5,B002KISB56,"I love Jane Austen. Her stories, though written in the 1800s are timeless. The basic themes of love and family are something we can all relate to. Emma is one of my more favorite of Austen's stories. It is more humorous and lighthearted than some of her other more serious works (Persuasion and Mansfield Park come to mind). This version of Emma really brought out the natural humor in the work.

Emma Woodhouse is a well meaning busy body. I have always found her character to be well intention-ed, if a little naive and pretentious. I think this version really does a good job of showing Emma's progression from a young child with little to no thought about the consequences of her actions to a more mature woman who is more apt to think before she acts.

I love the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightly in this version. The actors have great chemistry. It shows their slow progression from very close friends to lovers. They truly care for the other, they can fight and quarrel and disagree and still love each other. Differences of opinion are not great barriers to their relationship as they might be in others.

One aspect that I really loved about this version of Emma was that it really emphasized some underlying emotions and motivations that I hadn't noticed before. It really emphasized how sheltered Emma was by her father, how afraid he was to let her do anything or go anywhere for fear that he might lose her like he did her mother. Emma often states that she will never marry, citing reason after reason, but never really saying the real reason she didn't want to consider marriage. She is incapable of leaving her father, it would break his heart. She could never do that to him, so rather than longing for something she knew she might never be able to accept, she pushes away all desire to get married herself, stating that she never wishes to marry. Instead she contrives to get each of her friends married. She denies any desire to be married and instead projects that feeling onto nearly everyone around her in a desperate attempt to keep herself from any romantic attachment while at the same time vicariously fulfilling her own desire for marriage. She is constantly pushing suitors that she herself might like or who might perchance pursue her (Frank Churchill and Mr. Elton) off on her friend Harriet. It was an interesting aspect that I had never really given much thought to before, but was subtly brought out through this version.

Overall, between the great acting, the fantastic sets and costumes, and the subtleties that are cleverly brought out this is my favorite version of Emma.",1361404800,,2619,4.711790393013101

This blows the other Gwenneth Paltrow one out of the water. With J. Austin, you need to take the time to tell the tale.

So, guys, take the time to watch, learn... and push aside the need for sex and explosions.

This is a well told tale of the inner workings of meddling relationships and prejudices, and how we overcome them with honesty and sincerity.

The acting is incredible and photography is dead on for the tone, not to mention that it's clean for gals of all ages if they're interested enough in the tale. (which even my 6-year-old was)

Gentlemen, take a couple evenings and snuggle up with your lady or daughters and let the story immerse you in this world of deep relationships, love, frustration and joy.",1360627200,2,951,4.442528735632184

Although Jonny Lee Miller is likeable and did a good job, I didn't have that feeling that I wanted them to get together like it should have been. I would have liked a bigger, handsomer guy for a match with such a beautiful woman. It seemed to me through the years, they were just good friends and didn't know they loved each other until they danced at the ball.  As pretty as she was, and he was older and rich, I think that he would have tried to sweep her off her feet before anyone else got her.  I would have liked him to steal a few kisses throughout the movie to let the audience know he felt a sensual spark for her.  Except for those two points, I just loved it. I love historical romances and this movie brought all the clothes, the old way of life, conveyances, etc. to life for me. I enjoyed all the varied personalities in the many characters, but above all to me, Romola Garai's star quality made this a beautiful success!",1360281600,,1059,4.355329949238579

I do agree that it was a bit slow in the beginning and middle, especially as you're waiting for problems to resolve and for Emma to be reasonable already, but it was fun and pleasant.
Other versions of Emma I've seen make Emma seem a bit too mean-spirited, and I thought this version struck a good balance of making her just naive and a bit self-centered, rather than actually snotty or mean.",1360022400,,514,4.354166666666667
3943456,1,B002KISB56,"Like many of the reviewers, I am an ardent Jane Austen fan and take great enjoyment in the various movie adaptations of her books. The most interesting thing about these adaptations are how the story is re-invented and interpreted throughout the years. Who is cast and how much of the overall look and feel is retained or slightly updated, and how the main leads interact with each other.

I had high expectations for this new version, and heard/read rave reviews. Boy, were all those positive adulations so off the mark! In this version of Emma, we have Ramola Garai. As our lead heroine, while beautiful and flits about in her silly endeavors at matchmaking, fails to convey the clever earnestness and tongue-and-cheek wit that is so Emma Woodhouse, and have seen well executed in other versions. Garai did not understand Emma Woodhouse, and therefore, did not know how to play her. This Emma comes off far too manipulative and calculating, selfish and immature, and worse, insincere at almost every turn, oftentimes putting down every person around her. The elegant intelligence and bubbly charm was gone, replaced with a vapid interest in the trivial and came off...dislikable. That alone is an astonishing feat to manage. This Emma didn't seem to grow up and mature, but became more annoying and frivolous as the film progressed. Johnny Lee Miller is a solid actor, but as George Knightly, is also woefully miscast. He came off timid and uncertain, almost shy and confused, the complete opposite of the Knightly we all know: classy and worldly, kind and wise but always confident but modest. Also, Garai and Miller lacked ANY chemistry! Chemistry alone can make up for a lot. If they were two people playing brother and sister, they would have been ideal, but as two lovers, huh? I just didn't get it at all.

The direction (Jim O'Hanlon), screenplay (Sandy Welch), casting and acting is what makes this movie different from other versions, and not in a good way. The direction was mediocre, the screenplay awful, the casting neither here nor there and the acting, just off. There was no energy, little substance, the dialogue was poorly written and executed, and after the second episode, didn't leave me wanting more though I kept watching, hoping it'd get better. The script was nothing short of uninspiring but the editing was well done. The supporting cast did a good enough job, but they added very little to overall feel of the movie. It felt very much like they just happened to be there and it was all so heavily focused on Emma. There was faithfulness to book's structure that I appreciated but it was constantly mishandled throughout by either the pithy acting or clumsy narration. While not a terrible addition, this just wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be and very surprised by all the praising reviews. The production, musical score and costuming were lovely but unfortunately, for me, this 2009 BBC version of Emma fails to capture any of the most important elements of Emma: a genuine, vibrant and joyful excitement and coy amusement. There was no fun, no lightness. If this was supposed to be the updated and modern version, it failed. I watched it once, and that was enough.",1360022400,12,3202,4.851919561243144

3943459,5,B002KISB56,"After Emma Thompson's 1995 Sense & Sensibility, this is the BEST Jane Austen Adaptation. I wasn't expecting to like it this much, and was frankly very surprised. The first 15 minutes get off to a depressing (and somewhat comic) start, with people dying and rain pouring...I expected it to be one of those bad quasi-Gothic interpretations that Masterpiece Theatre has been cranking out in the last ten years (perfect mood for the Bronte sisters' books, but NOT Jane Austen or even Dickens). However...it quickly goes off in another direction, and becomes very, very funny.

Romola Garai as Emma and Johnny Lee Miller as Mr Knightley was the most perfect casting I've seen in a very long time. The acting was phenomenal--and they struck just the right magical balance of both Emma's lovable good-natured naive-headed charm and her interfering brattiness. With Knightley, they managed to make him every bit the cranky, principled, kind-hearted bachelor who is genuinely attracted to Emma in a very non-creepy way. That is another great thing about this movie--it really gets all the complicated emotions of the heart down right, but it is done real--not cheesily. There aren't any hot kissing scenes, and its not about sexual attraction and projected romantic ideals, but good, old-fashioned, down-to-earth familial affection. You know--the people who know you, who REALLY know you, and they know you are a brat and love you in spite of (or because of?) it. This isn't one of those Austen adaptations that is for sexual/romantic thrills...this is one that is about comedy, and how funny and frail human nature is, and why people are worth it any way. It is really a comedy about ordinary human beings (and how they are so obnoxious and beloved), not a romantic escape of anything. Even my 14 year old brother deigned to watch the whole thing, and loved it.

Like all movie adaptations, there are a number of departures from the book. However, unlike most adaptations, this one definitely gets the 'spirit' of Jane Austen's works. I suspect if she was alive today, this might be her favorite one.",1358640000,3,2092,4.974285714285714

I didn't appreciate pride and prejudice and probably wouldn't have even understood it had they not came out with an updated version on dvd. I enjoyed the movie so much I was encouraged to read the book that I would have never read in high school. I enjoyed and actually found myself understanding the writing and characters. I have watched everything I can put my hands on by Jane Austin including the different versions of Emma. I love how this young lady portrays her so emotionally. She is a little on the spoiled side but is put in her place real quick by her beloved friend whom she doesn't even realize she has feelings for till it smacks her in the face. Her match making finds her and others in trouble but in the end everyone is joined happily as they should be. I just wish Jane were still alive so we could have more clean classical entertainment.

After reading the book and seeing another earlier version, I found this one a rather excellent bit of storytelling in a subtle manner that takes a second viewing to really appreciate, as it gives the viewer a rather good feel for the people presented and the times they live, in the class they are a part of. The longer running time from a 'film' is important in this respect, as otherwise, a lot of the subtle feel of the walking from one room to the next would need to be edited. It could be done, but this is a nice example of 'getting it right'. It's all about choices and the choices made by the production team served them well here.",1356825600,,652,4.308943089430894

All in all, I think Emma was very inferior to Pride and Prejudice (referring to the TV series here). I did enjoy it, but it wasn't nearly as good. Or maybe that's because the original Jane Austen novel wasn't as good. Anyway, I wasn't as taken with Emma.

Still, I think it was an interesting miniseries. I have a few observations about it. It's much darker than Pride and Prejudice, in both senses of the word. I think it's less light and merry in terms of feel, and also all of the rooms are much less well lit. It's probably more realistic for the time period than Pride and Prejudice; I seriously doubt candle-light would create the light rooms there. And it was also more sad. I actually was tearing up in the opening minutes, when the British narrator guy talks about the three children: Emma, Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. So a much darker take, I think.

The casting was pretty well done. Mr. Knightley wasn't that handsome, but I grew to like him a lot throughou tthe 4 hours. (But then again, Emma wasn't that pretty either.) I liked all of the characters except for Harriet Smith; she was so ugly at times. I think she should have been a bit prettier. One other thing that I liked was at the ball, the dancers all applauded the musicians. I don't know if that would have actually happened, but it was a nice touch.

Emma is a nice adaption of the novel and if you enjoy Austen TV/movies or Emma specifically, I would highly recommend it. You can find all of it online.

By the way, in regard to age difference concern with Romola and Johnny.  The two are 10 years apart.

Born Jonathan Lee Miller 15 November 1972 (age 40) - first acting jobs in 1983.

Born Romola Sadie Garai 6 August 1982 (age 30)  - first acting jobs in 2000.

Now I can understand the confusion because Johnny has such a yummy baby face.  But he is 10 years older.",1349654400,,1723,8.698863636363637
3943507,4,B002KISB56,"There are many changes to this adaptation of Emma that mirror the book more closely and give more insight into the characters, owing to not being limited by a film's 2-hour time limit.  All these additions (different from the Paltrow version) I absolutely relished. Knightly, Mr. Woodhouse, The Eltons, The Taylors, Harriet, and the Bateses--all lovely.  The one flaw is Emma herself.

Subtlety, thy name is not Romola Garai.  Unfortunately, Romola is so clownish in her mannerisms, always pulling faces to a cartoonish degree, so distinctly modern, that it is quite distracting and stupid to behold.  Harriet acts more lady-like than she!  Emma should be the picture of ladylike manners--the height of Highbury society and refinement--she is a town patroness of sorts and respected and deferred to by all.  Instead, here she has the bad manners of a modern-day girl with no care for the exertion or modesty appropriate to the Regency period in which the character lives. She is very vulgar and shows no delicacy, no moderation, no refinement, no reserve that a gentleman's daughter ought to embody and be a model of.  She is openly ridiculous.  When Mrs. Elton rolls her eyes at Emma's flagrantly bad behavior at the picnic, you can't help but agree!

Gwyneth Paltrow did a better job of being elegant AND portraying Emma's imperfections at the same time: meddling, impertinent, misunderstanding, etc., with a heart beneath it all (Paltrow's Emma is less conceited than the book's heroine).  Romola Garai instead brings out even MORE impertinence and conceit than the book.  Romola takes the 4 episodes to bring you back to her side and she changes some of her worst flaws (sadly, not her bad acting habits)--I commend her because she pulls that off. At the end, I do believe she is reformed. BUT, it is so hard to forgive Garai for her over-the-top facial expressions!  She also has poor posture (she slouches and walks gracelessly), shouting or screaming dialogue, and even shouting ""Woooooo!!!"" several times at the ball as if she was at a rock concert. She even dances like a farmer's daughter.  The actress portraying Mrs. Taylor is a good example of ""acting your thoughts in a subtle way"" with small looks and slight expressions, rather than making your face EXPLODE as Garai does to convey the same thing.  Now, Garai has a few wonderful moments of purer, simpler acting, but then in the next scene, she ruins it again by over-acting.  It's too bad the director wasn't stricter with her--I felt that with more direction on what NOT to do, she would have been better.

If you can get past how anachronistic she is, however, you will enjoy this. I actually hated the series the first time I saw it--angry with Garai the whole time for ruining it.  The second time I saw it a long while after, I enjoyed it heartily, despite being aware of the problems with her performance. Besides Emma herself, the rest of the series is really stellar: from design and production value to script, ensemble cast, costumes, etc... I recommend this for fans of Austen with the thought that you might enjoy it more once you make peace with Garai's garish portrayal of Emma, or the second time around.",1349654400,3,3187,4.8487084870848705
3943508,5,B002KISB56,"As indicated in the title of my review, customers are charged per episode to view the series, so this is not for the entire movie. The production itself is superior, and I rate it five stars.

Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation, Emma (BBC, 1972) was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in Emma (A&E, 1997) which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of ""Emma"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.

This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as I Capture the Castle,and Daniel Deronda. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.

The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of ""Mansfield Park""Mansfield Park (1999) which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in Byron. I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!

The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version), as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in Daniel Deronda cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park.

The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).

Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of ""Emma"" thus far!",1348963200,2,4628,5.155792276964048

3943510,5,B002KISB56,"As a devout Jane Austin fan, I am thoroughly delighted with this movie version of ""Emma"". Ramola Garari is exquisite. Playful, sharp, and snappy yet capable of thoughtfulness, repentance and tender depth, the beautiful Garari brings this classic, beloved character to life. The cinematography is gorgeous, yet it does not replace or supersede the intelligent dialogue that makes a Jane Austen story so unique and enjoyable.

Jonny Lee Miller is fabulous as well. Although maybe a bit young, his understated yet quietly intense demeanor makes for a handsome, tasteful Mr. Knightly. The music is truly lovely and accurately highlights the important emotional movements of the movie, providing a satisfactory cinematic substitute for Austen's descriptive prose. The scene at the Highbury ball is pure joy.

Michael Gambon created an extraordinary portrayal of the quirky yet beloved Mr. Woodhouse. The two other movie versions of ""Emma"" portrayed such pathetic versions of this complex character. While Mr. Woodhouse is obviously a wounded soul, yet in the original novel he is well loved and truly respected. Gambon enacted this tension perfectly. Gambon's Mr. Woodhouse becomes a rich, sympathetic dear soul.

The supporting cast is more than adequate, although the aforementioned actors steal the show. Frank Chruchill is well cast, unlike other versions. He is both complex, sympathetic and slightly provoking. I love the nuance and narrative given to Frank and Jane's romance. The attention given to their childhood tragedies enriches the plot wonderfully.

So often one feels that a movie has skimmed over the most savory parts of a classic novel. Yet this version of Emma leaves no such residue; instead, Austen fans will be thoroughly satisfied and delighted.

I have not enjoyed a movie so much since A&E's classic ""Pride and Prejudice"". It is a truly beautiful classic that I had to own and will enjoy with my three daughters for years to come.",1348704000,3,1951,5.260450160771704

I personally like Romola Garai, and for the most part I enjoyed watching her as the ever vain but good-natured Emma. But oftentimes I found myself cringing a bit-- Romola's Emma was occasionally a bit overdone.  My biggest pet-peeve (although something many modern viewers would not mind) was that she never carried herself the way a woman in Austen's age was expected to.  She frequently flopped into or slumped in chairs and bounded into rooms.  The camera work and set was very good, and the actors were well chosen for their parts, but aside from Mr. Knightley, the characters were approached a bit differently than what I have read and seen before.

3943521,5,B002KISB56,"This 2009 BBC miniseries of EMMA is, quite possibly, the loveliest screen version yet of the Jane Austen favourite.  Casting the principal roles with noticeably younger actors and featuring a sparkling screenplay by Sandy Welch (""North & South"", 2006's ""Jane Eyre""), this new ""Emma"" will, I'm sure, satisfy all those who hold the story dear.

Emma Woodhouse (played in this version by the radiant Romola Garai) is one of Jane Austen's most singular heroines.  Unlike Elizabeth Bennet, the Dashwood sisters, Catherine Morland or Fanny Price, she is, at the start of the story, already in complete possession of her place in society and has her own fortune.  More pointedly, she doesn't require a husband.  Emma instead has made it her business to play matchmaker for her various family members and friends, and has most recently married off her beloved governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May) to widower Mr Weston (Robert Bathurst).

Her attention is now drawn to Harriet Smith (Louise Dylan), whom she grooms as something of a ""protge"", guiding the inexperienced girl through the pitfalls of finding the proper husband.  Emma is sure that she has found him in Mr Elton (Blake Ritson), but she is shocked when she learns that Elton is more interested in Emma herself!  Watching from the sidelines is Emma's dear old friend, Mr Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller)... could he be another possible match for Harriet?  Emma's manic hobby of playing cupid masks her own growing feelings for Knightley, but as the game draws on, she is forced to finally confront her own restless heart...

Casting this version ""younger"" gives EMMA a newfound shine and sparkle, and I've been surprised at the amount of reviews on here which have criticised Romola Garai's performance in the title role. We've probably been spoiled by the poised, elegant Emma's of Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow (and to a lesser extent Doran Godwin's crisp, no-nonsense Emma in the '72 BBC miniseries).  Each actress has brought something unique to the part.  We need to remember that, in the book, Emma is barely out of her teens and as such probably wouldn't have had the sophistication or elan of a woman who was exposed to London society.  Unlike her older sister, Emma has spent her entire life at Highbury, and this would have significantly impacted her general day-to-day behaviour.  When the imperious Mrs Elton (Christina Cole) arrives on the scene, we can catch a glimpse of the clash between the ""city"" and ""country"" social attitudes, and the life Emma might have had if she indeed ventured on to London.

I'm delighted to see Emma's sister and brother-in-law feature more prominently in the action here (in past versions they were always painted as passing, almost inconsequential characters).  Tamsin Greig's Miss Bates is depicted not as a doddery old spinster but instead a rather vital woman, probably still only in her late-40's (again something completely refreshing and a casting move I heartily applaud).  Jeremy Northam has some serious competition with Jonny Lee Miller's Knightley - I can hear women sighing all over the world.  The Elton's are hilariously overbearing - Christina Cole plays ""snotty"" so terribly well, as evidenced by her earlier performances as Blanche Ingram in ""Jane Eyre"", and as Miss Bingley in ""Lost in Austen"".

Everything about this EMMA is light, fresh and utterly delightful.  It's like discovering the story all over again.  Just let go of your pre-conceptions and enjoy.  Recommended.",1338422400,4,3488,5.082456140350877

I was perfectly surprised, as I did not hear too many great things about the mini series. I think it was fairly genuine in comparison to the novel, and much better adapted than previous versions.

The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).

Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of ""Emma"" thus far!",1333324800,8,4435,5.197202797202797
3943526,4,B002KISB56,"I loved this version and intensely disliked it at the same time.  Most of the cast was absolutely perfect and really brought their characters to life.  Michael Gambon was especially delightful as Mr. Woodhouse (""in case the dancers should do something remarkably foolish...like opening a window"") - lovable, charming, and brilliantly deadpan. Blake Riston was similarly humorous as the fatuous Mr. Elton.

Austen is tricky to adapt because of her strong narrative voice.  Extensive narration isn't an effective tool in film, so adaptations usually struggle with replicating her wonderful dry wit, but this one does it better than most. The minor characters manage to convey the jokes Austen made at their expense and let the audience in on the joke, not an easy task. Mr. Woodhouse's neuroses, Mr. Elton's vanity and foolishness, Harriet's paltry brain activity etc are portrayed in such a way that you get some of Austen's humor, if not her voice.  What is remarkable about this version of Emma is that it's populated by Austen's actual characters, not signifiers for those characters.  Most adaptations are a window onto the world of the book - you get a partial version of Mr. Knightley, or Mr. Bingley, or whoever, and the film relies on you, the reader/viewer to fill in the details from the book.  This Emma takes no such shortcut - it truly brings the book alive.  Well, the supporting characters.

Where it falls completely short is in the title character herself.  I think the script, direction, and actress are equally to blame, but whatever it is, it's maddening.  Romola Garai is imitating another famous RG, Regina George, and starring in Emma: Mean Girls edition.  She's loud (what is with the shrieking?), shallow (Emma is supposed to be intelligent), has exaggerated bratty teenager mannerisms (""um, no""?!?! Are we in 1812 or 2012?), highlighting all of Emma's flaws (and adding some new ones) without suggesting any of her virtues.  As the series goes on it's increasingly difficult to know what Mr. Knightley sees in her other than her beauty (RG definitely looks the part, I just wish she would act it as well).  Austen would cringe watching RG screech, bounce, and 'um, no' her way through the film.

But the rest of the cast is so wonderfully engaging that it makes 'Emma' hard to resist (just Emma herself. Or 'Emmar' as Garai pronounces it).  Read the book again, then sit back and enjoy watching Highbury come to life on film, and ignore the Mean Girl in the title role.",1333324800,2,2494,4.902380952380953

Johnny Lee Miller is great as Mr. Knightly, he really brought out the character on all aspects, his feelings for Emma, his brotherly role, not too overbearing, he had this masculine quality with just a hint of vulnerability, humility, just loved him. I loved all of the side characters, they did just a fabulous job with casting and i kept comparing this to the other versions and just felt the others were definitely lacking.

3943531,5,B002KISB56,"I've seen three adaptations of Emma, the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow, the 1997 TV adaptation with Kate Beckinsale and finally this one, starring Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller. This one is in my opinion the absolute best by far, especially if you read and enjoyed the book, but it isn't your favorite Austen novel. By that I mean that this adaptation manages to stay mostly faithful to the events and characters of the novel, while making some welcome ""improvements"" that are very much in keeping with the spirit of the book.

The leisurely pace of this film (actually a four part miniseries) allows for more exploration of the real motivations of the characters. At the risk of being horsewhipped by some Austen lovers this may even improve on the book. For example, Mr. Woodhouse's (wonderfully portrayed here by Michael Gambon) well known valetudinarianism retains its light humor as in the book, but gains a touch of pathos by the film gently reminding us that his wife's death was sudden and traumatic and that his light tyranny about illness and diet and travel comes from love rather than self occupation. Miss Bates (played by Tamsin Grieg) also enjoys this treatment, showing us not just the silly chatterbox spinster, but also the very real sadness and loneliness of the ""gentlewoman of reduced circumstances"" we so often contend with in period pieces. Even our understanding of Frank Churchill's (Rupert Evans) careless bad-boy-with-a-good-heart antics are broadened by the subtle suggestion that he might be just a little angry that he was sent away by his father all those years ago.

Romola Garai is completely charming as the slightly spoiled and conceited Emma, but she adds a touch of navet and impetuousness to the character to keep her relatable and endearing. Contrast this with Paltrow's portrayal of the character as a sophisticated, politic, social adept in the 1996 adaptation and it's easy to see why Garai's version of the character is so much more lovable. She's so much more human. Similarly, Emma is rendered much more sympathetic by this version's suggestion that her life, while seemingly charmed, has shortcomings and that her misguided matchmaking is not just about her vanity but also an attempt to deflect her own attention from the isolation and boredom she feels as a motherless girl taking care of an elderly father. Plus the added but somewhat shallow bonus of Garai being absolutely lovely to look at doesn't hurt.

Jonny Lee Miller is a revelation as Mr. George Knightley, family friend, neighbor, and the brother of Emma's brother in law. Miller injects tremendous humor and personality into a character that can prove somewhat of a conundrum for modern readers/viewers. Knightley is reinvented from the rather tame, somewhat prematurely middle aged gentleman of the novel into an intelligent, slightly unconventional, independent thinker, making for a much more interesting and engaging character. He plays Knightley as rather in love (though perhaps subconsciously) with Emma from the start, which makes his scolding of her seem less creepily paternalistic and more lovingly done in the service of someone he deeply cares about. And while Miller is just the right age for the part, his portrayal of Knightley with quite a bit of youthful vitality and physicality makes Emma's attraction to a man 16 years older than her much more plausible, and dare I say, much less disturbing. (In fact he was 37 when the production was filmed, the exact same age as the character in the novel, which is why I don't understand the contention by some that he was too young for the part.) Miller excels at the humorous side of Mr. Knightley, indeed, even in scenes where he doesn't have many lines, his facial expressions are enough to make you laugh out loud. Watch him closely during the first dinner party scene where Mr. Elton arrives late, and the scene where Miss Bates comes to Hartfield to deliver the news that Mr. Elton is getting married, to see what I mean. Overall this incarnation of Mr. Knightley is the best yet, in my opinion. Infinitely preferable to the reserved and almost cold Mr. Knightley played by Mark Strong in the 1997 adaptation, and even a bit better than the very capable and attractive Jeremy Northam in the 1996 adaptation.

There's great chemistry between Miller and Garai, and their verbal sparring is exhilarating. On the one hand it's comical because they both so clearly feel that they are the expert on everything, and also a bit sexy by way of the aforementioned chemistry and because this was surely what made for flirtation between clever people in the Regency period. Every zinger they throw at each other is foreplay.

The cast is rounded out admirably by Jodhi May as a surprisingly young Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, Robert Bathurst as the amiable Mr. Weston, Louise Dylan as the hapless Harriet Smith, Blake Ritson as the handsome but pompous Mr. Elton, Poppy Miller as Isabella Knightley (formerly Woodhouse), Dan Fredenburgh as Mr. John Knightley, Laura Pyper as the talented but sad Jane Fairfax, and Christina Cole as the obnoxiously haughty Mrs. Elton. In particular, Dan Fredenburgh as John Knightley was quite enjoyable even though he has very few scenes. He plays Mr. Knightley's slightly less agreeable brother to great comic effect, and yet gives the suggestion by his mannerisms and sense of humor that he and Miller's Mr. Knightley really are related. You actually feel that these are two characters who might have grown up in the same household. Whether this was by design or purely a happy accident is unclear, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.

Overall, a very fine adaptation, not to be missed among devotees of Austen or lovers of period dramas.",1329091200,98,5738,4.990595611285267

3943539,5,B002KISB56,"As a lifelong Janeite, I have read Ms. Austen's books countless times. I have also tried to make it a point to get my hands on any Austen production (and to a larger extent, Georgian/Victorian/Edwardian drama.) Unfortunately, the only ""Emma"" I have yet to see is the Kate Beckinsale version - but I have seen the 1972 BBC, the 1996 Paltrow, and now the 2009 version.

If you took a poll of a number of Austen fans, most would probably say that Elizabeth Bennet is their favorite heroine. I love ALL the heroines (including the much neglected Fanny Price) but were I to choose a favorite, it would certainly be Miss Emma Woodhouse. Of course Jane Austen predicted that hardly anybody would like such a character as Emma except herself, but it is to Ms. Austen's credit how Emma Woodhouse grows and evolves from the beginning to the end. I find it hard to believe that people would harbor any dislike for Emma once the story wraps up - she's an amazing character, and among Jane Austen's most complex creations.

Before the BBC came out with this production, I admit that MY Emma was the Jeremy Northam/Gwyneth Paltrow 1996 movie. It was still my version of Emma even after I saw this version for the first couple times. I thought, at first, that this Emma was a good adaptation but the 1996 one was better. But it grew on me, and quickly too. It has now become a period drama I love and adore and I consider it the version of Emma I love best.

Of course, comparing the two productions would be like comparing lemons to limes - one being a 2 hour movie, the other a 4 hour miniseries. They are both good in their own right, but I hope this may be a little insight as to why I believe this version of Emma is worth purchasing (as well.)

The Paltrow movie uses lines directly from Austen's book, and the atmosphere does reflect the world of the book nicely. The 2009 version, while capturing the essence of the book as a whole (and being faithful, in large part, to the book) does not utilize Jane Austen's witty lines as often as its predecessor. Instead, screenwriter Sandy Welch uses some of her own words to tell the story. It is no question that Austen will always trump anybody's own original words, but Sandy's script is still a good one. I am usually not one to condone liberties when it comes to transferring a book to the screen (especially when it comes to something I love, like Austen). In fact, most of the time my insides tend to boil like hot water in a tea kettle at the thought of a period production going ever-so-slightly off book (I'm looking at you,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mansfield-Park-1999/dp/B004XVMCMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mansfield Park (1999)</a>). But I can forgive Sandy Welch (who has written such beautiful productions such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Theatre-Jane-Eyre/dp/B000LPQ6DE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-South/dp/B000AYEL6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North & South</a>) because while it may not be Austen's words verbatim, Sandy brings Emma to life.

The locations and costumes of 2009 Emma are a visual delight! Almost every scene is like a Georgian era oil painting. It is all so beautiful.

As to the actors - both productions have a wonderful cast. Jeremy Northam was always my Mr. Knightley, and he still has that title, but now he shares it with Jonny Lee Miller. I associated Jonny Lee Miller as Edmund Bertram in that horribly disappointing adaptation of Mansfield Park. He wasn't bad in that movie...but I was nervous because this was EDMUND - somebody already in the Austen canon. But I had no reason to be since Mr. Miller was a FANTASTIC Knightley. He brings a slightly different approach to the character than Northam, but you will still sigh with happiness by the end of the fourth episode. To me, Romola Garai is the perfect Emma. Gwyneth's Emma was a refined, spoiled, snobbish, manipulative young woman. With Romola's portrayal you still have a spoiled young girl whose meddlesome matchmaking ways make the people of Highbury her playthings. However, she matches her friends with the best of intentions - she befriends and counsels Harriet Smith in good faith; she, unlike Gwyneth's Emma, does not look down upon Harriet. Moreover, the scene at Box Hill in which Emma makes a remark against Miss Bates is how I viewed her action best. You could sense a bit of malice in Paltrow's Emma, whereas I feel Romola's said it out of lack of tact, which is how I understood it in the book. However annoying Miss Bates could get, Emma did not hate her and I feel she was genuinely sorry for what she said. Michael Gambon made me love Mr. Woodhouse - he was by far my favorite character in this series. He was as described: a gentle tyrant. And he is laugh-out-loud hilarious. He definitely deserved the Emmy nomination. The rest of the cast are very good from Louise Dylan playing the sweet but simple Harriet to Christina Cole as the annoying Mrs. Elton, and Blake Ritson as the arrogant and pompous Mr. Elton.

This DVD is marvelous in and of itself. The case is hard (it almost feels as if it were a book) with a gorgeous design. The inside is just as gorgeous with a beautiful image of Romola Garai on both discs, and a picture of the Box Hill picnic lining the inside of the case. The features are also very interesting!

3943540,1,B002KISB56,"As an avid Jane Austen fan I have always loved watching so many renditions of her novels come to life. This was the first one which was too arduous of a task to watch the whole thing.  For one, there was no grace, elegance and proper mannerisms for the lead actress who was terribly miscast as Emma.  With her awkward walking, throwing herself on a bed after having a tantrum, and bulging her eyes out at every turn, I found myself paying more attention to her mannerisms than the movie itself. She was entirely too modern to play this role.  She also seemed unsophisticated and refined.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by other actresses managing to have the lady of the Jane Austen era down to a perfect science.  I just didn't find her believable by any stretch of the imagination.

The ladies' costumes paled in comparison to so many other Austen movies as well.  The gentlemen's costumes were nicely done, though.  The sets were lovely; which was a welcome relief.
The story seemed to get lost in the new screenplay which didn't reflect Miss Austen's original storyline.

I am sorry to say that I got through only on disk of the two disk set and have little desire to watch other one...not unless I planned on being ridiculously masochistic one evening.

3943541,5,B002KISB56,"... except for Mr. Knightley, of course.

This is, imo, the best version of Emma. Mr. Knightley is clearly in love with Emma, almost from the begining, unlike in the other versions, and I think that adds to film. Romola Garai's Emma is snobbish sometimes, yes, but she always means well, and just as in the novel, you can't help but forgive her. The length really helps too. I love all of the subplots and nuances, but those take time and they get their first film outting here. The costumes are beautiful, as is the whole design of the shoot.

What sets this version apart from the others is the chemistry between Garai and Miller. They bicker and get on each other's nerves, but they could never not be friends. While he does council and scold her, in this version he does not act like her dad when he does it, and that makes a huge difference. Everybody wants a best friend like this.

My BIGGEST problem with this version was Mr. Knightly. He is one of the most important characters, HOW COULD THEY GET HIM SO WRONG?  Everything about the actor they choose was extremely weak in comparison to the strong, no nonsense knightly which is found in the pages of Jane Austen's Emma. This actor with his squeaky voice and inability to be convincingly stern did not bring Mr. Knightly to life for me. I had to stop watching it.

The A&E version though not as pretty did a better job at bringing the two main characters to life. Although I have issues with that version too, it remains my favorite so far. I am however a tough critic. I cannot love a movie unless I feel the actors have done the characters justice.

However, if you can surpass the ""simplified"" language and you have NOT read the book, this is a wonderful movie. It still expresses Austen's wonderful ability to create likeable characters and wonderful love stories.

3943547,5,B002KISB56,"As indicated in the title of my review, customers are charged per episode to view the series, so this is not for the entire movie. The production itself is superior, and I rate it five stars.

Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation, Emma (BBC, 1972) was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in Emma (A&E, 1997) which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of ""Emma"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.

This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as I Capture the Castle,and Daniel Deronda. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.

The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of ""Mansfield Park""Mansfield Park (1999) which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in Byron. I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!

The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version), as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in Daniel Deronda cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park.

The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).

Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of ""Emma"" thus far!",1313625600,20,4628,5.155792276964048

The scenery is incredible (and there is a segment dealing with locations included), the costumes (also discussed in a segment) are amazing and the characters are loveable, or laughable, as they should be.  Romola Carai is enchanting.  Yes, she is bouncy and breathless, but who could not love this very special young lady.  I fear those who really like their Jane Austin predictable and a little stilted, may not
like this interpretation, and judging from other reviews, are actually offended by what they feel are liberties taken with our plain Jane.
Nonsense!  Slip in the disc and get set for a beautiful production.  Romola Garai is radient and Jonny Lee Miller is, well, very sexy!

3943549,5,B002KISB56,"I'll admit it ... I've never cared much for Emma. Neither the book or any of the other movie versions made previously. I always thought she was a rude, stuck up snob and quite frankly that Knightley deserved better.

After watching this miniseries I have realized that I missed all the subtleties of Miss Austen's amazing creation. I also realized that because I didn't read the book until AFTER I had seen the other two movies that I approached it already believing that I knew what it was. I, like Emma actually, was quite small minded and prejudiced!

For instance I had never understood the true dynamics of Emma's relationship with her father (who it turns out is quite the hypochondriac ... who knew?). His overprotectiveness has kept Emma in quite a small world thus giving us insight into her rather narrow minded beliefs about people and the world. But it is also a relationship of great love and her care of her Father gave her, in my mind, her first redeeming quality.

The storyline with Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill was always so incredibly confusing to me. When did they meet? Why was their engagement a secret? Why did he act like he wanted Emma? Why was Jane always so reserved and quiet? And most importantly why were we supposed to care about any of it? I just never got their point. That is until this miniseries highlighted the incredible paralell between the lives of Jane, Frank and Emma herself. All losing mothers at such a young age. And finally I understood their relevance. FINALLY I got it!! I appreciated how we see that even though they were playing everyone else for fools, their secret relationship took a toll on Frank and Jane. Because of that I enjoyed watching their joy at finally being free to dance in the square.

Every character was fleshed out. Every storyline was told with precision. I could see the joy, heartache, laughter and light in each and every scene. And I realized with a shock that the story of Emma is actually fun and funny.

Thanks mostly to the inspired comic one liners of Austen's most underrated Hero - Mr. Knightley! One of my favorites from his early argument with Emma over Harriet Smith and Robert Martin ... "" Really, it is better to be without wits than to apply them as you do, Emma!"" And his little fist punch and growl of frustration because she's so thick headed. I was rolling I tell you. ROLLING! Or after watching Mr. Elton ride away to London with Emma's portrait of Harriet, ""That man is so full of himself it's a wonder he can stay on that horse."" And even during his tender and overly late pronouncement of his feelings to Emma ""If I loved you less perhaps I could talk about it more!"" was delivered so perfectly as to evoke a chuckle and a sigh at the same time.

But nothing was as impressive to me as Emma's progression as a character, from a self centered, narrow minded, snobbish and spoiled rich girl to kind, thoughtful and maturing young woman. In the end she is not perfect but she, finally, is at last aware. We leave the story knowing that Emma will always be who she is. She'll always have strong thoughts and definite opinions and she will always try to manage those that she loves. She may even find herself being an occasional snob and making quick judgements that come back to bite her in the butt. Yet we also know that she's enough of a woman to admit when she's wrong and learn from her mistakes. Best of all she's a woman who knows her heart. And who has managed to marry the one man in all the world who could manage her!

So for all you Jane Austen fans out there who, like me, felt incredibly disloyal for disliking her supposedly favorite heroine, for just not ""getting"" it ... This movie is for you. It brings Emma to life, giving it shades and depth. It highlights everything that was important and builds on it to the point were all you can see is the good.

I'll go to bed tonight seeing Emma and Knightly standing arm and arm on the cliffs overlooking the ocean and finally will feel like I'm happy that they found their way there together.",1309910400,11,4052,4.488466757123474
3943550,5,B002KISB56,"Move over, Kate Beckinsale. Gwyneth,I love you, but please. Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller are the [...] in the newest, and frankly, the best version of Emma.
The characters are perfectly cast and perfectly delivered--Mrs. Elton as obnoxious as ever, Mr. Elton is ridiculous & Ms. Smith is delightfully foolish.

Most importantly, Johnny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley is FINALLY the right fit. Way better than MArk Strong 'I held you when you were a baby' (voms) and Jeremy Northam 'Perhaps it's our imperfections that make us so perfect for each other?'(queso). Honestly, I would have stopped the betrothal dead if my special man friend had uttered either of those awkward, creepy lines when sealing the deal. I like both the actors, but not as Mr. Knightley. And to be fair, the script adaptation is better and allows for the actor playing Mr. Knightley to be less cheesy.
Anyways, Ladies, gays and Austen afficionados, doooo it and don't look back. The details, costumes, scenery AND two full discs allow you to properly savor the classic. Well done, indeed!

(Obviously if you are a heterosexual male, you could probably give two flips over this, but when your girlfriend is on her lady time, needs chocolate and forces you to watch a chick flick with her, you want her to watch THIS version of Emma. Trust me.)",1309305600,6,1317,4.823008849557522

There is at least one scene completely left out of the movie, and I can't be sure it is the only one.  I was very disappointed as it was at the climax of the movie.  (For those that have seen it, it is the scene on the bench when they are discussing the workings of her heart.)

3943552,5,B002KISB56,"This is a beautiful, spirited adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. The only other adaptation of this book I had seen previously was the Gwyneth Paltrow version (and Clueless!), and although I liked that film, this one far surpasses it, in my opinion. The costumes and sets are beautiful, as well as the cast! Some reviewers have mentioned Romola Garai's modern mannerisms in the film, like flopping down on the bed and what not. First, I don't think there's any reason to believe that people did not act like that when they were alone. I also think that these sorts of moments with Emma allow us modern viewers to connect to the character and the time period more easily.

Finally, the dvd case is beautiful as well. It opens like a book, with the cover resembling and feeling like that of a hardcover.

If you are a fan of Jane Austen, period dramas, or both, then I highly recommend this dvd.",1306022400,7,891,4.5625
3943553,5,B002KISB56,Such a beautiful adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma.  I am so glad they dedicated almost six hours to this version.  Gorgeous music and costumes.  Fantastic acting.  Well done!,1304899200,2,174,5.107142857142857
3943554,5,B002KISB56,"I wasn't all that impressed the first time I watched it. I thought the little prologue was cheesy (and they fudged with the timeline), Emma was too over-the-top, Jane Fairfax was too mousey, and that it just wasn't all that special. But when I got to the third episode, everything changed-I started to love it! And when I got the DVD and rewatched it all, I appreciated the first two episodes more as well.

Being four hours long, this version has enough time to flesh out all the characters and storylines. Both the 1996 versions, being so short, had to obviously cut some stuff out. Either the Frank/Jane or the Harriet/Mr. Elton stuff got the shaft. This one does justice to both, plus more! We get to see a lot more of Robert Martin as well, and we even get to see him go ask Mr. Knightley's advice as to whether to propose to Harriet. It follows pretty closely to the book, but it does make some changes and a lot of the dialogue is different.

The parallels between Frank Churchill, Jane Fairfax, and Emma are stressed more than in any adaptation or the book. Mr. Knightley narrates the introduction with the three as children- when they all lose parent(s) and their lives are changed forever. I found this narration a bit weird the first time I saw it but now I think it was a clever introduction, really. The only reason it bothered me was because it was different from the book, really!

Most of the cast is very good- some of my favorites of all the adaptations. The interplay between the various characters was excellent (in most cases). The Crown Ball scene was particularly well-done. The dances (all originals to this production) were really lively and fun. Emma and Knightley's dance just oozed chemistry. I think I played back this scene three times on my latest rewatch. I could almost go so far as to say the miniseries is worth watching for this scene alone! I also think they got the Box Hill scene right (with the exception of Frank lounging on Emma's lap!). Emma was clearly laughing and joking around and didn't realize how hurtful her comment to Miss Bates was until it was too late.

This was a very well-done series, but not without its flaws. One part I still am not fond of is the end. I thought the editing of the scenes after Emma and Knightley confess their love was a bit choppy. I thought the individual scenes were well-done, but there were really no transitions between them and I had no sense of how much time had passed or anything. Like I said, just too choppy.

Still, all the negatives are pretty minor. I feel that this a must-see for any Jane Austen or period drama fans.",1304294400,,2613,4.5042194092827

The actors capture each of the characters of Miss Austen's work in a flawless, captivating, touching, and highly entertaining manner. I wish to give this movie more than 5 stars. Divided into 4 parts, I simply could hardly wait to begin the next episode. The video clip is good, but the movie is a million times more than that.

3943557,3,B002KISB56,"Many of us already know the story.  We are familiar with details, mannerisms, the wit and subtlety of Austen's work.  If I lay all that aside, this is not a bad movie.  I personally don't find Romola Garai at all engaging as an actress.  She portrays her characters in a ""soap opera"" style, far too overstated for my tastes.

So throwing my own, personal dislike for her aside, I can tolerate this movie.  But I won't be rewatching it anytime soon.  It is NOT Jane Austen's Emma, even in character.  I could forgive the dialogue if I could get over the mannerisms.  Emma is a 21 year old woman, not a 16 year old! And I agree with other reviews in that I think she waves too much, its distracting, especially where a delighted smile would have sufficed.

Unlike other reviewers I actually enjoyed the Jane Fairfax in this movie.  She was pathetic, but I didn't think it was so bad that it took away from the story.  It was interesting for me as an Austen fan to see that side of the story explored in that way.  It caused me to go back and read the story again and notice how they picked up on little details that are placed randomly throughout the story.

I think this movie is worth watching, the costumes are gorgeous, if a bit vibrant for the time, and the acting for some of the supporting characters is quite well done.  Just don't take it as Jane Austen's Emma.  If I had been prepared in that way I may have enjoyed it a bit more.",1302825600,3,1438,4.270370370370371

This film version of the book, however, brings out what I didn't find in Austen's writing. Managing and ignorant (bad combination, that), Emma is still charming and fun, and I make allowances for her, as does the staid but sweet Mr. Knightley.

There is so much artistic license that at times I think that the writers have no sense of the spirit of Emma at all. The characters are not true to their literary nature. I could go on criticizing but I actually don't enjoy putting the creative efforts of others down. If you are looking for an entertaining period drama this is great. If you are looking for Emma you won't find her here. The writers are primarily at fault. Then the Director. Then the primary actors... in that order.

The actors are very likable. The acting is natural although I do agree with the other comments that Romola as Emma was not acting too ladylike all the time with the way she plops on the bed and runs around unlike Gwyneth who was very refined as Emma. Still, Romola is adorable! My favorite is Johnny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightly! He suited the role very well. EMMA is Jane Austen's heroine who is not in need of money, she does not need to find a husband to survive. I would have liked it better if her manor was more grand to give that feeling of luxury. I have seen so many period movies and usually when they are rich, the houses are enormous!

adorable in dealing with Emma. Saw it on TV and had to have it for my collection!

3943592,5,B002KISB56,"I've seen the various adaptations of Jane Austen's ""Emma,"" but no movie (or actress) really seemed to capture the lighthearted brightness, romance and sweetness of that book. Fortunately, such is not the case with the BBC's latest adaptation -- it's a sunlit, enchanting little story that dances along at a leisurely pace, and has a brilliant cast headed by the astonishingly good Romola Garai.

After matchmaking her sister and her governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May), Emma Woodhouse (Garai) fancies herself an expert on human nature, and on ""nudging"" couples into matrimony. The acerbic Mr. Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller) isn't impressed.

And after Miss Taylor becomes Mrs. Weston, Emma ends up becoming best buddies with Harriet, (Louise Dylan) a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the illegimate daughter of ""somebody."" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her, and focuses her efforts on matching Harriet to the rather smarmy but charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest matchmaking attempt falls apart, she vows not to mess with people's lives again -- but she can't help but be interested by Harriet's potential suitors.

At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard of her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill (Rupert Evans), and the reserved and ""perfect"" Miss Jane Fairfax (Laura Pyper). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax -- and ends up alienating her further on a disastrous day out. And as she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.

Out of all Jane Austen's books, ""Emma"" is the frothiest and lightest, and this adaptation reflects that well -- it's bright and sunny most of the time, full of ""fairyland"" balls, lush green fields and forests, and the a quaint little village. There's some moments of seriousness (such as the somber, rainy examination of the similarities between Jane, Emma and Frank), but nothing that keeps Emma Woodhouse's sunny charmed life from proceeding as usual.

Fortunately, the story also explores Emma's maturation over the course of a year or two, and the writers also expand on the feelings and lives of Frank, Jane and Mr. Woodhouse. Ir's laced with plenty of clever dialogue (""That man is so full of himself, I'm surprised he can stay on his horse!""), gently barbed humor and beautifully orchestrated moments of subtle romance, such as Emma and Knightley's dance together or Emma's simple declaration of ""I began to examine my own heart, and there YOU were.""

And Romola Garai makes the perfect Emma: young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and a little snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, and Garai makes her lovable and endearing even when she screws up. Jonny Lee Miller is similarly brilliant as the restrained, stern Mr. Knightley with his sharp wit and unconventional habits (such as when he tells Emma why he rode a horse to a dinner party).

The supporting cast is also brilliant: Michael Gambon is of particular delight as Emma's dismal hypochondriac dad, who still tried his best for his daughters, and Jodhi May is amazing as Emma's ex-governess. Dylan was adorable as the naive Harriet, and Evans and Pyper are excellent as Frank and Jane. Tamsin Greig, Blake Ritson and Robert Bathurst all do good jobs as well -- and Christina Cole is wonderfully horrible as the snobby, domineering Mrs. Elton.

The newest adaptation of ""Emma"" is enchanting from beginning to end -- beautiful direction, solid writing, and an amazing cast. Definitely a must-see for Austen aficionados.",1287273600,2,3731,5.016155088852988

Although it may not be appealing to people who give themselves credit as an ""expert"" of what Jane Austen is all about AND it may not be the best adaptation of the book, it certainly made me want to read the book and compare.  I physically struggle with reading and to have something like this that made me want to read despite how uncomfortable it is for me, has to be something special.  Just from watching this movie, I have wanted to see other adaptations of Jane Austen books in films and do the same by following up with reading the actual story.

I love the chemistry between Knightly and Emma and how it is captured on film.  Out of all the BBC remakes of Jane Austen, the actors cast are the closest to how I see them in my mind.

At first I have to admit I didn't care for it much, but it grew on me in about the first half hour and now I think I prefer it to the older one.

3943599,5,B002KISB56,"The previous two versions of Emma (Gwenyth Paltrow and Kate Bekinsale) left me completely frustrated with the character. Romola Garai has created an Emma that is likable, maybe even lovable. Her character flaws are depicted as symptoms of her unworldliness and loneliness due to her father's terror of the outside.

The other character stories are fully developed, so the focus is not on Emma alone.

My one objection would be the casting of Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston. She and Romola Garai played romantic rivals in ""Daniel Deronda,"" (another Masterpiece, literally) and here she depicts Emma's governess. They are but 7 years apart in real life - she should not be playing matronly figures just yet.

The screenplay is superb, the directing divine. Charming adaptation!",1283817600,3,781,5.182539682539683

Those who makes comments on these pages that Romola Garai does not live up to the role and that others in the cast, such as Michael Gambon, are inadequate are utter fools. Garai is stunning and a superbly nuanced actress and gives a bravura performance. Gambon is a sweet and dear Mr. Woodhouse who is subtly hilarious. Having not read the book in a few years I can not speak to the scene to scene (in)consistencies in the novel vs. screenplay, but this adaptation stands strong on its' own merit. Garai, on whom the whole production centers, as it should, is a far superior actress to Paltrow. And the older productions do not even belong in the conversation.",1283385600,6,694,4.650406504065041
3943601,5,B002KISB56,"I just finished reading ""Emma"" and I think this book is Jane Austen's masterpiece.

I own two film versions of Emma.  The 1972 BBC version, which I thought was very close to the book.  Although the actor portraying John Knightly, John Carson, was 45 years of age and too old for the role.  Knightly was 37 in the book.  The actor portraying Mr. Woodhouse looked like he was on his death bed.  Too old and too fidgety.

And then there is the version with Gweneth Paltrow.  Beautiful scenery, beautiful homes.  They squeezed too much of the book into the film.  And then the cast, good grief.  Harriet Smith is 17 years old in the book, slender, short statured.  What were they thinking when they cast porky older Toni Collette in the role?  Paltrow is an American and her accent just drove me over the edge.  And what was she saying when she realized she loved Mr. Knightly ""oh John oh John, how I love you.""  His name is George, George Knightly.  John is Emma's brother in law, not her love interest.  Good grief.

So, here we have the 2009 version and it is magnificent.  Simply superb.  Brilliant casting.  The actress who portrayed Miss Bates just nailed it.  Mr. Woodhouse is brilliantly portrayed and not like an idiot.  Mrs. Weston is shown in this movie pregnant, as she is in the book, unlike the other two movies.  The actress who portrayed Harriet Smith is appropriate for the role.

Romola Garai is Emma, that lovely flibbertygibit gad about.  Johnny Lee Miller is perfect as Mr. George Knightly whose love for Emma is on his face from the first frame.

Jane Austen said that no one would love Emma but herself.  Well, she was wrong.  And what would Jane Austen think about all these wonderful movies based on her masterpieces?  Thank goodness for Austen's genius.  Jane died too soon at the age of 42.  I wonder what other glorious creations would have come from her pen.",1283299200,5,1883,4.561561561561562

The location photography while pretty, has no particular style. Biggest complaint: why is this spread over four hours? Hopelessly padded. Johnny Lee Miller is no Jeremy Northam.

3943603,3,B002KISB56,"First off, I'm an avid Austen fan, and I've read this novel at least 3 times and I've seen every adaptation it both movies and miniseries. Wow, so this modern adaptation of Emma did not sit well with me at all. When I first found out that the BBC was filming this I was burning with anticipation only to be disappointed when i finally watched it in its entirety.

Whats wrong with it? Romola Garai as Emma. She did a good job as the 18 year old Briony Tallis in Atonement, but this role was not for her. Her mannerisms and conduct definitely set early 19th century propriety at naught. She also lacked the air and self importance that Emma has in the novel. Yes, Romola Garai was cheery and bright like the Emma from the actual novel, but I really don't like Romola Garai as Emma, she just didn't do the job for me this time around. I definitely prefer Kate Beckinsdale as Emma in the 1996 version. This Emma is far too modern. You cant see the division between the classes in this version that is present in other adaptations as well as in the novel. This emma seems to be on the same footing as Mrs. Cole or even Mrs. Elton.

What else is wrong with it? The script. While the storyline followed the novel pretty well, the dialogue was surprisingly lacking in the wit and cleverness that I really enjoy in Jane Austen's novels.",1282608000,2,1328,4.350806451612903

I'll admit that Gwyneth Paltrow was hard to chase out of my head as Emma, but after just the second time of watching this, Romola Garai has easily replaced her. And Michael Gambon as Mr. Woodhouse - classic!! Such a great performance by the entire cast!

3943605,5,B002KISB56,"There is no doubt that the dramatization of a Jane Austen novel is immensely popular, perhaps none so much as Austen's `Emma' which revolves around one of the few Austen heroines who is wealthy and doesn't ""require"" a husband to maintain her status.

The latest adaptation, written by Sandy Welch and broadcast originally as a four-part BBC television drama, is outstanding for it's visual beauty, and production values. Shot on location in the villages and parishes of southern England, you immediately are immersed into a romanticized version of 19th century England. The costumes are beautifully authentic and provide an individualized palette of color for each character that substantiates their personality and status in life.

Director Jim O'Hanlon made excellent use of a continuous camera flow that follows the actors through various rooms without missing a line. The casting choices are right on, with no distracting oddities. O'Hanion, working with this excellent cast, obviously put a great deal of emphasis on facial expression and it is a delight to watch great actors convey subtle nuances that enhance the storytelling.

3943610,2,B002KISB56,"I scanned some of the good reviews of this adaptation, saw the 4.5 star rating, and borrowed a copy, having watched most of Jane Austen's adaptations and still wanting more.  Excited with what I thought would be 4 episodes of Emma and much of the book covered, since the last two I saw were movie-length.

Unfortunately, this was very much a disappointment.  Emma and Mr Knightley as played by the leads in this adaptation are not what Ms Austen described in her book.  Nor are the smaller roles true to the book.  Emma here is so not elegant and so not charming and capable.  Mr Knightley lacks command.  Jane Fairfax fails to appear reserved and beautiful and accomplished.  Miss Bates is too subdued.  Mr Woodhouse's funny eccentricities are not coming across.

And so much liberty was taken with the dialogue and story that from the first scene of this adaptation I was open-mouthed at what they had done to it.  Sometimes certain scenes or plotlines have to be adapted to suit the screen, but here the changes and additions were numerous, made no sense nor improved the original story.  Also, the language in the book may not be modern, but this is a period drama, was there a need to do away with Ms Austen's charming dialogue?  I wonder if the screenwriter is familiar with Jane Austen at all??

If you don't care about all that, this is a pretty series, the scenery and colours are nice to look at, the soundtrack is pleasing, some may even think Emma looks pretty (not me though).  But if you are a Jane Austen or Emma fan, don't just glance at the top reviews, read the one and two-star reviews first before purchasing this.  I infinitely prefer elegant Gwyneth Paltrow's or spirited Kate Beckinsale's Emma.

To finally have a new BBC series of Emma and have this as a result... I hate to think how many years more I have to wait for a good version to be produced.  I am glad I managed to watch this before purchasing a copy.  I would not want this in my collection.",1278720000,7,1976,4.5

But what we need to understand is that they are not making photocopies of the book on screen. They are making movies ""based on"" the books. We should allow the movie makers' immaginations and interpretations and see the movies as an individual piece of art. Now, about this version, I should say that it might not be the most faithful adaptation of the book ever made, but the casting is just perfect. The actors make the book characters come alive for us. Especially, the chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightley is very pleasant.

I was also encouraged by it's length, for surely in 4 hours they would be able to finally show all the subtle nuances and interaction between each of the characters that made me love this book so much. Now I wonder how many of them (including my brother) has even read the book. It was like watching Mel Gibson's Hamlet all over again, an enjoyable movie as long as you have no idea how the story is really supposed to go.

This version of Emma takes all 4 hours to give you the story of Emma's entire life even if they have to make it up.  There is the inclusion of several scenes found no where in the book used to explain (if not outright change) the people around her when simply following the story as given would have accomplished all that and more.  There is absolutely no subtlety to the interpretation but rather it is as if, failing to understand the story themselves, the script writer attempted to make it as similar to the A&E ""Pride & Prejudice"" as possible within the framework of the story given.  The frequent 20th century mannerisms would not have been quite so glaring if not for their frequency at times or their appearance in the same created scenes.  I found myself expressing disbelief more then once in outrage at Emma's entirely inappropriate behavior in a young lady that is portrayed as so refined in the original writing.

The subtle interplay in the book that illuminates the characters is entirely missing with the exception of some lip service in the beginning as to the character of Emma's father.  Even that is dropped quickly and nearly ignored. As I often do with movies like this I watched it with my husband who has not read the books, nor intends to.  Each time something was done differently or omitted and I took the time to explain it to him or tell him the original dialog he would laugh quite heartily; the rest of the time he was for the most part entirely bored.  Afterward I took the time to explain to him the real reason for Jane's discomfort over discussing the Campbells and Dixon, the relationship between Emma and her governess and the inability for anyone other then Mr Knightly to check her, missing scenes of her scheming to bring about a marriage between Ms Smith and Mr Elton, how and why Ms Smith told Emma personally about her decision to marry Mr Martin after all, how much Emma's response to this showed her growth as a person, and just how Emma and Mr Knightly actually convinced Emma's father to give his consent to their own marriage and, as before, my husband enjoyed the explanations immensely but had no way of knowing any of it from what he had seen in this movie.

I attempt to collect the movie versions of each of Jane Austins stories that I feel has done them justice.  This one will not be joining my collection.",1273881600,12,2915,4.481132075471698

It is the scene where Mr. Knightly reveals to Emma his love for her.  His subtle facial expression mixing adoration and self-doubt are absolutely wonderful.  Believe me, this version is well-worth watching just for that scene.

On an additional note.  Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned that the BBC version is different from the PBS version.  I was not sure that I wanted to purchase the dvd, but now I am anxious to see the deleted scenes.",1272412800,5,674,4.6525423728813555

We decided to try this after enjoying ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, and ""Sense and Sensibility"" with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. It is long, and must be viewed in pieces, but we enjoyed each character and every detail. The color and cinematography were beautiful, and the music only enhanced the drama. My only complaint would be being held captive to BBC advertisements at the beginning of every viewing.  Our DVD would not allow us to bypass these same advertisements we'd seen many times to go directly to scene selections to pick up where we left off.

I had seen the 1990s movie with Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and also the Kate Beckinsale production. I think that for both of those, the casting and acting were good--each actor brought their own interpretation to the character. But after seeing this production, the others just couldn't satisfy! Say what you will about liberties taken with the manners and wording, but by the end of this show you can really see the transitions that the characters made and believe in those changes.

This has to be my favorite Emma by far. I enjoyed the Gwenyth Paltrow version because of Jeremy Northam, but I have never felt that it did the book justice. Besides, Gwenyth is decidedly NOT British. This new version is fantastic though. The actor playing Elton is actually the same guy that I loved in Mansfield Park, so that threw me a bit. However, he was perfect in the part, especially since Elton is supposed to be good looking, and it seems they rarely cast a good looking actor for the part. I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Knightley. They make the film. Michael Gambon as her father is perfect as well.

The older versions of the stories have much to recommend them but a fresh new take is always welcome and this new version of Emma is no exception. This rendering takes it time with a longer running time than previous ones and I really enjoyed the expanded story lines. It feels like it breathes more and it answers questions that other versions leave unexplained. The entire cast is quite good and bring their characters to life in a very human way. At first I thought Jonny Lee Miller looked too young to play Mr. Knightly but he is actually about the correct age in real life and does a wonderful job. I also liked Rupert Evans as Frank Churchill. We get to know him better than in previous versions and he brings his awkward situation to life in a way that makes you feel for him even though he doesn't handle it all that well.

However, do buy the DVD - it's a wonderful and surprisingly faithful adaptation. Romola Garai is (apparently) not to everyone's taste but to me she's a wonderful Emma - she perfectly captures the willfulness, self-centeredness, but deeply good heart of Austen's most human and modern heroine.  As Mr. Knightley, Jonny Lee Miller is subtle, deep, and, yes, I couldn't write about an Austen hero without adding 'dreamy.' I'd never heard of him before this but am quickly catching up on all his work - he is a superb actor, profoundly different in each role he plays and absolutely wonderful in this one.  Almost all the secondary actors are pitch-perfect -  particularly John Knightley (an oft-overlooked character played here marvelously), both Eltons, Miss Bates and of course Michael Gambon as an anxious, fussy Mr. Woodhouse.  Gorgeous sets, mostly beautifully lit (I wish they'd used softer lighting for the ball at the Crown - the harshness detracted from an otherwise magical scene) -- all the accoutrements of grand country home, luxurious gardens, rich costumes and careful props you'd expect from a top-drawer BBC production.

Of course it doesn't literally follow the words in the book - it brings them to life, shows emotions and thoughts rather than tells them, and is perfectly faithful to Austen's spirit, her nuanced analysis of the class system, and of course to the evolution of the central love story.",1268611200,3,1588,5.065134099616858

3943657,5,B002KISB56,"There is 5 stars and there is with a particular cast and treatment of a classic,  greatness... in both craft and sensibilities. This is one of perhaps a 100 efforts since movie making started that truly deserves the word.

It is interesting to see different adaptations of Austen ... they often work or don't work because of casting as is the case with all movies.
Although I have given this 5 stars most of that is Romola Garai.

The rest of the cast is too very good with Miss Fairfax's talkie cookie relative excellent I forget her real name. But Romola's humanity... add real faults in the character and her growth and Emma's core playfulness... youth too but in the end budding full adulthood are truly wonderful and put her in the company of the BBC heroines in Pride and Prejudice and too Kira K's work in the adaptation a few years ago which of course were both extremely good if different.

Emma's love interest.. his demeanor  and change to romantic affection hidden...  is extremely well done if under stated which seems perfect; they are well matched for her and his... discovery of her love beyond his long time older brother relationship.

Buy it for Romola's historic performance alone for this is now a classic... but,  there is more in the cast to love.

But yes, Ms Garai's acting is that good but more than that she is so perfectly cast that one forgets while watching how far we are from those times of the early 19th century. This is too, because the series takes its time and tells the book's whole story, so that this version of Jane Austen has none of that need to transpose ideas and scenes and her classic lines, that sometimes confuse and mar so often shorter movies made from not only Austin classics but other beloved books as well.

Here they move at a book's pace but every scene accomplishes a task... and that is one of the secrets of the success of this version of Austin and the mid 90s version of Pride and Prejudice.

By this slowing down and many episodes... one feel's the characters become people, they come alive and are understandable and are not two dimensional personalities out of a historical play but rather are people... the pace is perfect for the material and all without that offensive extremely annoying Hollywood habit of shocking of the audience to keep the dull's attention.

I was not aware of Ms Garai before this movie but I am now a fan... what a sweet happiness exudes from her spirit and so perfectly matched to Austen's sweet meddling young semi noble matriarch of a small village... who is thinking about other people's love and loneliness while forgetting for a time, her own.

As for those who say that Romola Garai is not ""elegant,"" please! Elegance comes from the soul, good manners and honesty.
Not only is Ms Garai's spirit in tune with the story... and obviously... she has a depth of beauty that is rare, but unlike too many JA adaptations... she is wholly real. Mischievous, is a good word,  often happy and aware of her faults and willing to admit them even to Mr. Knightly, but too isolated with her father physically and culturally because of class which she is actually happy about... or rather she thinks she is.

We too see how integrated a prominent family was in a small village at that time straight from Austen's pen and her world without the retrojection of crass contemporary feminist politics that so demeans other versions of Austin, even the last very well done Pride and Prejudice, staring the ravishing Kira Knightly.

Emma is not played here as a cloth draped English early 19th century lifeless book character, rather she is a girl... at times and a young women at other moments who before your eyes, becomes a women with her first real deep understanding and wisdom... but whose elegant charms are most seen in her playful inner life, that is appealing for its humility: she laughs at herself very often and yet she too has an expected pride of class. These qualities too, one senses are a lovely inner part of the real Ms Garai.",1268611200,,4021,4.626404494382022

The British do a fabulous job again with the gorgeous scenery, fabulous clothing, and the estates of old English countryside bringing one into the time frame to share in the story.

I'm no big fan of the Kate Beckinsale version, so I was interested to see this new version starring reputable actors like Garai, Miller, and Gambon. I bought the dvd and just finished watching it with my husband last night, and he and I both agreed that the film is charming. Unlike any version I've seen so far, this series took its time in order to ""flesh out"" the character of Emma and let you see her strengths and weaknesses. It began in Emma's infancy and allowed the viewer to see her as a child, a teen, and then as the 21 year old we meet in the novel. At first I found this slow going, but I came to appreciate all the explication as it shed light on the character. Emma's sheltered life due to her father's overprotection was highlighted here whereas it is usually somewhat glossed over or ignored. I was leery of Jonny Lee Miller as Knightly, one of Austen's best leading men, in my opinion. I felt he might lack the physical presence Knightly needed to be the imposing figure he can be at times. But Miller won both me and my husband over as somewhere in the first episode, we looked at each other and said , ""I like this guy.""  He perfectly expressed Knightly's strength, goodness, intelligence, and humor while still seeming entirely human.  As the series draws to a close, we are shown both Knightly and Emma struggling with realizations about their own lives, and the result was realistic and quite lovely.

I was especially pleased with the chemestry between Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Mr. Nightly.

If you can live with the slightly more modern mannerisms, then you should love this adaptation.  I have a feeling that Ms. Austen would not have minded the slight liberties taken -- she always seems willing enough to welcome the new, while respecting tradition.  What is important for me is that the emotional truth of the novel is maintained, and even enhanced on occasion, if that is possible.

My favorite actor in this Emma is emphatically the beautiful Ms. Garai.  She gives a luminous, expressive and enchanting performance.  But virtually every actor does a great job, and we are allowed through their performances to see almost all the characters as fully rounded human beings, rather than stereotypes.  What a triumph for all concerned!  Do yourself a favor, and watch this Emma.",1267920000,2,870,4.944827586206896

Loved the performances, especially Ms. Garai in the title role -- she made Emma come to life for me in a way nobody ever has (sorry, Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Beckinsale!).  I loved Jonny Lee Miller, too -- actually, everyone was great.  There were so many story elements that I had missed in other versions -- nice to have the luxury, via a miniseries, of making it a bit longer!

The whole thing was outstanding and one of my favorite Jane Austen adaptations ever, and that's saying something because I have really loved several of the Pride and Prejudice interpretations I've seen.

3943675,5,B002KISB56,"Always up for a new interpretation of any favorite Jane Austen novel, I was keen to try this version upon knowing of its existence, though, there is always the trepidation of , `Did they get it right?'. For me, as long as the rendition is within the spirit of the morals, mood, story and style of Austen, I can accept little variances, alterations and additions. Am I a true Janeite? I do think that I am. Was I disappointed in this one? Not at all, I assure you.

Thoroughly eager to be treated, I sat down with my pretty tea cup and saucer (filled to the brim with a warm and delicious favorite milky drink) and with my split, toasted and buttered English muffin (crumpet) on the side. I knew not entirely or precisely what I was about to experience, but with so many fine British actors I had seen before (who generally guaranteed fine performances), and the BBC period piece promise of plenty of English Country eye candy deliciousness, I was confident that I'd be highly entertained.

Yes, there was a treasure trove of teacups, crystal and china; candle holders from the interestingly rustic to glamorous candelabras; wonderful furnishings and paintings, color, dcor and costuming; yummy old English and older architecture from the quaint cottage feel and village row housing, to the country manor and even the abbey or castle style. And then, of course there were the horses, always a personal must and favorite of my own. Who could object to horses? And what is more manly than a man on a horse, I ask you?

Well, after all that preamble, for my part, let me share that this version of Emma is gradually turning out to be my favorite. I watched it back-to-back several times upon receiving the DVD (not in one night, but night after night). Each time I was reaching the ending, I knew I wanted to see it from the beginning again as soon as possible. I still love the Kate Beckinsale version and quite like much of the Paltrow one, but, beyond the fact that this one is longer and therefore has more to offer in that way, there is all the more in other ways as well.

The added back-story of when the key young people were little (and lost their mothers to death) was done wonderfully and sets the stage for our goodly understanding of many of the characters a little more than we might have done before. Michael Gambon quickly and thoroughly charmed me as Mr. Woodhouse. Who could not love that darling man, the way he loves and wants to protect his family and even friends, and to keep them always near him? Gambon's interpretation may seem too subtle to some, but, to me, it is his gentle genius showing once more. Romola Garai sparkles as a delightful Emma throughout, and she evokes plenty of laughter at her mishaps and managements. Her natural beauty is even overshadowed, in a lovely way, by her happy ease of spirit in translating this persona of Emma. This Mr. Knightly, by Johnny Lee Miller, seems to me by far to be the most likeable of any before. I can truly believe that Emma could love him in the end. Indeed, and to be sure. His disparity of age melts away to a mere trifle and then to nothing at all. The Mr. and Mrs. Elton we have here, are each excellently hilariously entertaining. Miss Bates and her mother are sympathetic figures, more than ever before. This Frank Churchill seems a perfect fit too - just the right balance for this character. Yes, this Emma has promptly turned into my own personal favorite.

Add to all that, the extra special features on the DVD were a true treat and my only complaint is that there wasn't more - much more! My added request to that is a widely and easily available soundtrack to match - the music was also wonderful!",1267574400,4,3684,4.525525525525525
3943676,5,B002KISB56,"This is such a fun movie.  The acting is superb.  The music is so beautiful.  I love the scenes with Emma and Mr. Knightley.  The chemistry works so well.  ""Emma"" is not my favorite Jane Austen story.  It's rather silly and light, but this movie fleshes out so many of the characters and gives you more time getting to know them.  There are times when the movie doesn't feel very old-fashioned, but overall, it more than makes up for this.  The second half is even better than the first.  So, give it some time.",1267574400,,511,4.351063829787234
3943677,5,B002KISB56,"On the whole I have not been impressed with the latest round of BBC adaptations of Jane Austen's novel.  Admirers of Austen's novels want versions that capture the spirit of the novels, and that follow reasonably close to the plot.  Mansfield Park and Persuasion both failed miserably in these goals. It was an agony to watch them.  Northanger Abbey was a little better, flawed but enjoyable. Better still was Sense and Sensibility.  The creaters felt obligated to add a graphic seduction scene, incredulous that anyone could actually enjoy a love story that lacked this necessary ingredient, but otherwise I found it to be very good.

I was reluctant to watch Emma based on some of the review I read, thinking that it was going to be another frothy confection like Gwyneth Paltrow's madcap Emma.  Jane Austen wrote of this novel that no one would like the heroine except the author herself.  While it is a novel full of humor, it intended as a journey of Emma's education and growing maturity, not a screwball comedy with a charming but silly heroine.  Finally I did succumb and watch it.  To my surprise, I like it best of the four version I have seen (Godwin 1972, Beckinsale 1996, Paltrow 1996, Garai 2009).  There are occasional hints of modern attitudes and a glaring costume error (darts in bodices, a noticeable anachronism to costume buffs), but the creators managed a nice balance of humor and character development.  Romola Garai did a splendid job of showing when Emma was operating on impulse and when she was actually reflecting on her actions.  She portrayed equally well both Emma's warm heart and her streak of self-satisfaction.  As for Mr Woodhouse, I found Michael Gambon's portrayal to be the best I've seen.  The other actors all seemed well cast and turned in good performances.  I did think that Jane Fairfax's famous beauty seemed to be a little repressed by some country-mouse costume choices, but that is a minor quibble.  All in all, I was very well pleased, and this is the version I would recommend.",1267315200,5,2029,4.820809248554913

I thought they did a great job bringing Miss Emma Woodhouse to the screen.  Every single character is played so well, I felt myself being pulled into the movie.  They did a great job casting perfect people to play each role.  If you're an Austen fan, whether a huge fan, or dabbler, give this one a chance.  You'll love it!",1267315200,,501,4.221052631578948
3943679,2,B002KISB56,"Why read this review if you're already determined to disagree with me?

I, too, am an avid fan of Austen--of her novels and, if they are done really well, their film adaptations. I have seen the previous ITV Emma with Kate Beckinsale (1996), the feature film with Gwyneth Paltrow (also 1996), and this most recent version; and I have to disagree with those who say that this is the best of the three. It is, however, marginally better than the Paltrow.

This adaptation gives us pretty much the entire novel, which is the only reason I give it two stars; but it is not nearly as respectful of Austen's language as the admirably faithful Andrew Davies script of 1996 (ITV). Here, it has been ""modernized"", sometimes even ""dumbed down""--as if today's viewers were not able to comprehend the language of Austen's day. So much of her genius lies in her unique use of language and her choice of words. Even if additional dialogue, other than what is found in the novel, must be created, the screenwriter should try to remain true to Austen's manner of speech. Davies used much of the original dialogue for the 1996 script, but what dialogue he did create is virtually indistinguishable from Austen. Emma Thompson's excellent dialogue for Sense and Sensibility was almost entirely of Thompson's own creation, as there is much less dialogue in that novel than in Austen's other works; but Thompson successfully simulated Austen's voice and the vernacular of that era.

As to the characterizations...as fine an actress as Garai is, nowhere do we find the poised, graceful, self-possessed mistress of the house that Austen created; instead, this Emma is a giggly, awkward schoolgirl, just shy of being downright cartoonish. Yes, Emma is  young; yes, she is deluded; yes, she is a conceited know-it-all; but she is never silly. Because she became mistress of the house at a very young age, she is extremely mature for her 21 years, which is why she thinks she knows it all. Her ultimate conversion (thanks to Mr. Knightly) is all the more striking because of her almost tragic self-possession. Also, Garai's posture and walk are more suited to Harriet Smith or farmer Martin's sister than to the elegant and well-bred Miss Woodhouse.

Another off-the-mark characterization is that of Mrs. Elton. She is one of Austen's greatest comic creations, but there was nothing comic about this particular portrayal; she is played as vicious rather than ridiculously self-important. (The 1996 ITV Mrs. Elton is, in my opinion, spot on.) And much as I admire Michael Gambon, I do think he was miscast as the endearingly alarmist Mr. Woodhouse.

There has lately been a trend for trying to make Austen ""fresh"", ""modern"", ""accessible for today's audiences"". In the effort to do so, it often happens that Austen's distinctive voice is lost. She is ALREADY timeless just as she is. Let her speak for herself. Or use screenwriters with a true ear and respect for period language--such as Andrew Davies. If Austen must be adapted to modern times, then do it all the way, as with the very clever ""Clueless"", or the somewhat less clever ""Bride and Prejudice"".

The 1996 Davies version with Kate Beckinsale still gets my vote as the best adaptation of this novel, for both script and character portrayal.",1266969600,44,3273,4.907775768535262

I thought it did a great job following the book. There was a lot of detail and I loved the scenes. I thought all of the actors did a great job, they fit their roles! I just loved this movie. I have already watched it Twice and I have only had it about a week. I had seen the BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale, I was not thrilled with that one, I thought the picture seemed dark like they never had enought lights for the scenes and the actors just didn't fit their characters. (I mean Emma is suppose to be a blonde!!) Now the 1996 Emma with Gwyeth Paltrow I thought was just amazing. I have to say I think the 1996 version has my favorite Mr Knightly. He was just awesome. All in all this movie is great.

WATCH this movie if you just want a funny romantic movie because it will NOT disappoint!! The first time I watched an older version of Emma I had never read any of Jane Austen's book, my friend started making me watch the movies and I just fell in love with the stories.

To watch them alongside the various adaptations of the other Jane Austen novels, I would place Emma dead last in a list of favorites.  Gwyneth Paltrow even put me to sleep.  But this new BBC version is so far beyond the other attempts, I would place it up there with Sense and Sensibility, just behind Pride and Prejudice.  Let's face it, nothing will ever match the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice.  But this one is highly entertaining through and through.

Emma's character is rather sweet and extremely likeable. Romola Garia really shines here. I really think Garai and Miller are the best Emma and Mr. Knightly ever.

It is such a delightful movie. All of Austen's wit is represented but it also has one toe in the 21st century.

I loved the choice of location for Hartfield, It has lots of regency authenticity and yet reflects a warm and charming atmosphere that is portrayed in the book.

3943685,5,B002KISB56,"This version of Emma puts the others to shame. It is so splendid. All of the requisite elements are there, gorgeous sets and costumes and wonderful acting.

The characters, script and events are relatively close to the book. However it doesn't feel stiff and stilted, like an over done period piece. It does take some liberties with the book, but this makes it seem fresh and relevant. There are little modern flourishes here and there like Emma's hair and manners occasionally, and the music. But these are gentle touches and actually make the production much more enjoyable than an absolutely perfect regency piece.

I was completely enchanted with Johnny Lee Miller's version of Mr. Knightly. He is extremely handsome and witty. His portrayal was perfectly balanced between being the down-to-earth gentleman he was supposed to be and also humorous and engaging. He was just amazing- definitely an award winning performance. Romola Garai was a perfect Emma. She was so delightful. They were fantastic together.

This is not just my favorite version of Emma it is quickly becoming a favorite movie. I just adore it!",1266710400,3,1116,5.054347826086956

The chemistry between Garai and Miller is fantastic. They are both beautiful to watch. And their wit and timing is flawless.

Was Emma crying when Mr. Knightley was trying to confide his feelings to her? And then bursting into Mr. Knightley's study, sobbing that she cannot leave her father to marry him. Emma was such a strong character in the beginning, I don't understand why they turned her into a watering pot in the end. Perhaps it was that time of the month for Emma or the writer?

I still watch the movie over and over again, though I always cringe and try to stop myself from fast forwarding at those parts. Other than that, I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of the characters.",1266624000,2,742,4.496296296296296

One can only assume that the director was captivated by the actors and would not let them go.  There is not  weak performance in a cast combining familiar faces and new. The lead, Romola Garai, is the finest actress to appear for a very long time (and there are some very good young actresses about).  Her performance is so simple and direct that for a while I took her for granted, only slowly realizing that her very simplicity is astonishingly clever, and totally individual.  Once or twice I thought of Judi Dench, but she's nothing like Dame Judi except in ability and potential, nor like anyone except herself.  Austen's Emma is self-centered and tactless as she herself slowly discovers, and Garai makes Emma's blundering attempts to govern the lives of others credible, while making it equally credible that a man of sense and compassion would fall for her.  So do we.",1266537600,2,985,4.752941176470588

One of the best adaptations to date, lots of back fill, terrific acting, and great choices for the roles. This version made me see parts of a well loved story in a different light. Previously, I hadn't given much thought to some of the supporting characters, I just enjoyed them at face value. This adaptation has me seeing layers to them and how the past has carved their personalities. I also like that the sillier characters aren't played over the top, as so often happens. There is only one scene I feel was badly done and it's the scene where Emma goes to break the engagement so that she can continue to care for her father, it just felt like too big of a transition, it just kind of came out of no where. Other than that one scene the rest of the movie is fabulous.

Don't know how long this will last but at least for now, you can go to the PBS web site and see the whole thing for free. I tried to add the link but amazon took it out...can't really blame them.",1266451200,,994,4.177083333333333

i liked the adaptation and writing of this movie very well and in general would recomend everyone who like Jane Austin or period drama to watch it.
The only thing i would say i did not enjoy was some of the exaggeration of the characters: Mr Woodhouse is portrayed a tad on the extreme side and almost like agoraphobic not at all how i think of him. Also Frank Churchill (although well acted) always struck me as more flirty but not deceitful in the book, this adaptation shows him engaged in truly scandalous seeming behavior. Emma herself is also a bit of a problem, shes too argumentative and silly in my opinion.
the only thing i can think of is that the BBC/Masterpiece wanted to engage a more ""modern"" audience by amping up the drama for 2009.  These changes are noticeable but for your average Jane Austin fan who doesn't take the purity of story too serous, Emma is truly enjoyable and well worth the watch.",1266364800,3,1135,4.646766169154229

More shocking is that the multiple scenes cut where not just ""filler"" scenes, but actually dialogue scenes between major characters.  Most shocking is that PBS cut a conversation between Knightly and Emma prior to the dance - discussing her dance card and a scene following the proposal in which Emma & Knightly discuss when each of them realized their love for one another and many other scenes... shame on PBS for cutting the story to pieces!

3943696,2,B002KISB56,"I am quite disappointed with this version of Emma. I knew that something was up when I didn't see any special mentions in many publications prior to its first airing on PBS. In a nutshell, the screenplay (i.e. dialog and physical movements of the characters) is awful and does not do Jane Austen justice. I'm assuming that the reason that they didn't include a lot of Jane Austen's actual dialog was to make it more understandable for modern audiences. Was that the reason also for the characters to engage in so many bodily movements like flopping on couches and lounging while speaking and such that the upper classes would never have indulged in even in recent times? If I had behaved like that when I was growing up, I would have been quite censured (and I do not consider my family to be upper class or part of the aristocracy). I had the hardest time watching this version because of that, and some of the dialog made me wince or my eyes roll. I have yet seen a very good and true adaptation of Emma on screen, unlike ""Pride and Prejudice"", and I hope that at some point someone will make one. I, for one, can't wait! Be sure, this version is not it.",1266192000,16,1156,4.406542056074766
3943697,5,B002KISB56,"Believe you me when I say that I was very very skeptical and cynical before I started watching this version of Emma.  I had my doubts about Romola Garai and being such a big fan of Jermey Northam, I did not think Jonny Lee Miller would make a good Mr. Knightley.  I was proved wrong on both accounts.

This new version of Emma is absolutely delightful!  Some reviewers have called this Emma ""skivvy"" and too modern, but I found her to be fresh and lovable.  She is energetic and full of life.  Romola Garai portrays the many emotions of Emma so very well.

And as for Mr. Knightley--KUDOS to Jonny Lee Miller!!  I really did have my doubts--I just keep seeing him in Trainspotting--but he played this role like he was born to play it.  He begins to grow on you as Mr. Knightley right away.  The chemistry between the two is so very sweet.  The scene when they dance together at the Crown Ball was my absolute favorite--even more than the proposal.  I've watched that scene about a 100 times now (NO JOKE) and it makes my heart swell every time.

The supporting characters do a great job as well--though I prefer the last adaption's Miss Bates (PORK!).  The music is beautiful as well as the scenery.  Overall, so very well done!  Yay!

First of all, Knightly (Johnny Lee Miller) is way too young - isn't there supposed to be a 15 year age difference?  It looked to me like the producer's wanted a good looking actor instead of staying true to the story.  That brings me to my next point - the dialouge.  It seems that the screenwriter has decided to make changes that were un-necessary.

The best versions of all of Jane's stories are the ones that stay true to the entire story.  In the case of Emma, the version starring Kate Beckinsale is far better.

I have trouble keeping all the characters straight, especially since some of them have taken different names (Frank Churchill is actually Mr. Weston's son, for example).  When I started watching this, I was as confused as ever.  But I kept watching, hoping that I would be able to get everything straight in my head.  By the time PBS aired the last of the three parts, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.

Good casting, fine scenery, and gorgeous costumes are things I've come to expect from BBC productions of classic works, and Emma didn't disappoint.  After seeing this beautiful adaptation, I may have to rethink putting Emma at the bottom of my list of favourite classic stories.",1266105600,2,868,4.701986754966887
3943702,5,B002KISB56,"With the enduring interest in the novels of Jane Austen, an author eons ahead of her time as far as writing stories that dealt with women's view of the world, it is not unexpected that the film makers repeat versions of these rollicking tales.  This may be the fourth or so version of EMMA and for this viewer it is the most successful.  A large part of the success of this version of the novel is both the screenplay by Sandy Welch and the direction by Jim O'Hanlon who elect to open the graphic gates of Highbury with a sequence that shares with the audience the background of the diaspora of the children whose parents have died and whose lives will eventually come together as adults.  It works very well in setting the scene and the mood of class distinction so prevalent in England of the period.

Emma is brought fully to life by Romola Garai and this role further establishes her as one of the more important character actresses on film.  The remainder of the cast is perfectly balanced, with Michael Gambon as Emma's ever needy father, Jonny Lee Miller as the perfect Mr. Knightley, Lousie Dylan as the ditsy Harriet Smith, Tamsin Grieg as the hilariously boring and mouthy Miss Bates, the striking Blake Ritson as the vicar Mr. Elton, talented Laura Pyper as Jane Fairfax, and Jodhi May as the governess turned neighbor Anne Taylor.  The ensemble casting is as fine as any of the Austen transitions to the visual and the cinematography and costumes are first class.

The words may not all belong to Jane Austen (Sandy Welch has introduced some very apropos new lines), but the feel of the novel would likely please the author as much as it pleases the audience.  The 4 episode BBC production comes in two CDs and the quality of production is superb.  In every way, this EMMA is a joy.  Grady Harp, February 10",1266105600,,1819,4.569230769230769
3943703,4,B002KISB56,"Emma has been particularly well served on film and this version is much longer than either Paltrow's or Beckinsale's which is a plus. Here we have an Emma who is rich and handsome but not quite as clever as she should be, a victim of the modernized dialog many reviewers have commented on. Why not leave well enough alone - there's a reason we're still reading these books 200 years later!

The supporting players are very good as are the production values. All in all not up to the recent Sense and Sensibility but despite the above caveats well worth having.",1266019200,2,560,4.544554455445544

This version interprets the heck out of this thing, and adds a lot of dialogue to clarify their interpretation while cutting much of Austen's (superior) dialogue .  Harriet's voice is grating, although they do develop her character more than some of the other versions.  Emma constantly echoes Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal--not surprisingly.  I do like some of the points they make and some of the contrasts they draw: Emma's childhood fate, Miss Bates' poverty.  All in all, though, not worth it.  I would highly recommend either of the '97 versions over this.",1265932800,10,698,4.872881355932203

3943707,5,B002KISB56,"I was very very skeptical when I first heard that Masterpiece theater was doing another adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, masterpiece is very hit or miss when it comes to adaptations. But this movie was GOOD! Actually, it really was a miniseries cut into 4 parts. If you have seen the most recent adaptations with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam than you have to prepare for a different feel to this re-telling. It follows the book quite closely but it does take a few liberties. You can tell that they were going for a more realistic feel to this adaptation. Not every hair was always in place and not all of Emma's dresses were ball gowns. What I liked about this version of Emma was that they made Emma herself more realistic to her age and situation. She is young, only about 20 or 21 and has grown up loved but very spoiled. Also, her manner is consistent with how she would have grown up! Although born into wealth, she grew up around townspeople who were not of the same status. Although she knows her status and her manners reflect it, she is sheltered and used to her surroundings. This version was very realistic.
Two thumbs up! It's certainly worth watching and not to mention the two leads (Garai and Miller as Emma and Mr. Knightley) were especially convincing in their roles and had amazing chemistry with each other!",1265846400,3,1335,4.566666666666666

So I have a feeling that the one being sold here will be the version that cuts out that scene.  Why do movies that were originally released in the UK always have to be edited down?

3943712,3,B002KISB56,"Austen, of course, loved irony, but she might not appreciate 21st century directors who say how well she connects with people 200 years later, then ""modernize"" her books in their productions--to improve the connection. This latest screen presentation, alas, continually reminds us how perfect Miss Garai COULD have been, had this been Austen's Emma--which it is not.

Why? Because, in the 18th and 19th centuries, people at the age of 20 were considered adults and deported themselves with some dignity--especially if they occupied positions of social prominence and responsibility. This is the brilliance of Austen's Emma, the calm, cool, poised Mistress of Hartfield, whom we see grow through her calm, cool, poised--and calamitous--mistakes. Yet, especially in the interactions with Knightly, restrained emotion here is replaced with raised voices and waving gestures, even shouting; and at Box Hill, Emma and Churchill practically roll over the edge of the grassy precipice locked together.

Sadly, this has all the subtlety and none of the impact of a sledgehammer. The best (or worst) example? When Emma crashes, unannounced, into Knightly's library, hysterically slobbers out a relunctant refusal, then lopes off through the field, chased by Mr. Knightly. Good Lord. It's as bad as the scene in the recent production of Persuasion, where Anne Elliot races through Bath, coatless, hatless, heaving and gasping, to catch up with Wentworth.

Sorry, folks, this simply would not have happend in Austen-land, at least not without the author's laugher. Her brilliance was in revealing the emotions behind the outward decorum, not in ripping them out to the exterior (which was the technique of the later Romantic writers).

ALL of these brilliant actors could have delivered on a more understated and accurate portrayal. Had there even been a decent historian on the set, some mistakes could have been avoided--such as Churchill grabbing Emma's waist and watzing her down the empty Assembly Rooms: the waltz was still 25 years in the future, and he would have been cut by every family in town afterwards (especially by a justifiably smug Knightly--who, by the way, did not look to be Emma's elder by 16 months, let alone 16 years).

Having said all that, these great actors pull it off, despite (not because of) the directing, and the production entertains more than it annoys--just. The Eltons were perfect, as was Harriet, whose gentle humility convinces Emma that Knightly finds the young girl appealing. (Miss Bates, however, seems to lack the bustling energy that sparked her endless comments and which Prunella Scales nailed brilliantly.) And to see Miss Garai REALLY radiate, check out Daniel Deronda--where the scriptwriter and director are sensible enough to realize that they do not have more genius than the author.",1265673600,13,2827,5.287305122494432
3943713,5,B002KISB56,"I approach my Jane Austen adaptations as I do productions of Shakespeare....each will bring their own view to the story, each emphasizing different aspects.  Some will more true to the original text, some less so....and unless they violate the spirit of the original (sadly like Mansfield Park), I take each one on its own merits. This Emma may not follow Austen's text exactly, but in my opinion it was one of the most enjoyable Emma, or for that matter Jane Austen, productions I have seen. In retrospect, previous movies/series have been beautifully done...but this was both beautiful and the most emotionally engaging.

Ramola Garai is a lively Emma that, after early reservations due to her more modern manners, grew on me as the series progressed...much as Emma does in the book itself.  Emma's maturation over the course of the series is more believable and more evident here than in any other Emma adaptation I have seen.  Any hesitation I may have had about the casting of Emma faded as I watched the series - and the scene where she realizes she loves Mr. Knightley, but has potentially lost him due to her own actions was an incredible piece of acting on the part of Ms. Garai.

Ms. Garai's chemistry with Jonny Lee Miller is palpable and believable. My highest compliment of all is reserved for JLM: he is, by far, my favorite Knightley of all time...and this is from a huge Jeremy Northam fan (forgive me!).  He was the first I've seen to strike the perfect chord between the character's big brotherly scolding and his dawning realization of his true feeligns towards Emma. Incredibly subtle acting which conveyed more of this somewhat opaque character's inner workings than I could have imagined possible.",1265673600,32,1719,4.86986301369863
3943714,3,B002KISB56,"I recently watched this series on PBS's Masterpiece Classics.  I was reasonably entertained but did not enjoy this production as much as the 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma/dp/B00000G3AZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma</a>) which is, by far, the best.

I really wanted to like Romola Garai as Emma.  She's very pretty but, as someone else mentioned, her eyes tend to bug out a little to often for someone who is supposed to be a genteel young lady and her mouth is always hanging open, which I found distracting.  Also, some of the choices that she (or possibly the director) made did not suit the part she was playing.  Overall, I thought she was very sweet and charming but lacked the refinement needed for this role.

I really disliked the portrayal of Mr. Woodhouse.  Instead of being the lovable worrywart, he was just a depressed old man who seemed to take no pleasure in anything.  I thought Mr. Knightly was fairly well done by Johnny Lee Miller but still no comparison to Jeremy Northam, who was the ultimate gentleman.  The rest of the characters were reasonably cast, if not exactly perfect.  This film's Miss Bates seemed to be copy-catting Sophie Thompson's portrayal of the same character.

The worst part is that they changed much of the dialogue, which I can't understand, because it stands well enough on its own merit.  They took something which could have been very good and made a so-so production.  It was entertaining enough to watch on TV but I definitely will not be purchasing this series.  I'll stick with Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma.",1265587200,6,1634,5.1169811320754715
3943715,3,B002KISB56,"Having read the novel and watched both the Gwyneth Paltrow version and the Kate Beckinsale version, I must say that this BBC version is the most dissapointing of the bunch. I am an avid Period Piece lover and was simply over the moon when I heard this was coming out. Again, what a dissapointment!

The movie looks lovely and picturesque with great locations, props and architecture. The soundtrack is also pleasant and fits really well. The problem lies entirely with the portrayal of the characters. Almost every last one had me cringing at times.

To start: I have always pictured Emma as put together, collected, well spoken and for the most part, well-mannered. This version's Emma came off as immature at times, as well as goofy and appearance-wise- almost frumpy in certain scenes. Some of the costumes seemed ill-fitted which doesn't suit the character of Emma at all. Her actions and behavior came off a bit modernized and out of place.

Next, Mr Knightly, who should have been the epitome of suave and sophistication-instead looked stiff, unsure and almost out of place at times. Even as he scolded Emma, it was without the proper passion that could easily be felt from reading the book or even watching the great Jeremy Northam. Very dissapointed by his portrayal.

Mrs. Weston, I have always envisioned as almost regal, genteel and astute. But here, she comes off as a smiley, goofy lady who barely has any influence over Emma. I found her to be very odd here.

Frank Churchill was rude and pompous moreso than I ever imagined him to be and quite annoying. While hiding his love for Jane Fairfax, he goes off and completely insults and makes fun of her? The complete opposite of a gentleman who should have been brought up much better than that. Again, his character was not at all how I perceived him to be.

Speaking of J. Fairfax: Skittish, awkward and constantly wide-eyed here. Did not like her character at all.

I could list every single character's faults but as this would take forever, I shall stop with the main players. I know everyone has their opinion, but as an avid Jane Austen lover, I was deeply confused by the odd portrayals and again, dissapointed by the whole thing.

This isn't a bad adaptation, just a more modernized take, which isn't to my liking. For me, the 1996 feature version will remain my favorite and most accurate.",1265587200,20,2361,4.741463414634146
3943716,4,B002KISB56,"I have always considered myself an Austen purist, therefore I am not a little surprised at my reaction to this 2009 production of ""Emma"". In spite of the modernization of the language (phrases like ""set the record straight"" among others), and Romola's flouncing and padding and plopping about (entirely, charmingly in character, I feel; Emma, as played by Romola Garai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Capture-the-Castle/dp/B0000SX9MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Capture the Castle</a>), is an enthusiastic young lady who has grown up without much reining in), I was enchanted by it.

  What some see as out-of-character lowness in this portrayal of Emma, I see the behavior of a very spoiled, unworldly, untraveled country girl-- yes, Emma is every bit a country girl-- who has had her way in everything, is very used to praise (her class as much as anything, opens her to this, since her ""inferiors"" want to please and flatter her constantly), has never wanted for anything, and is, by nature, not given to introspection. Her heart is good, and she eventually learns to empathize with those around her even though she wreaks havoc in the meantime. It is interesting that the only two characters given to impulsive/compulsive smiling are Emma and Miss Bates, suggesting that, perhaps, in better days, Miss Bates' character was similar to Emma's ?

  In the book, Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse, a country squire and fearful but lovable hypochondriac(played by the equally lovable Michael Gambon), is somewhat unconventional and blurs the lines of social distinction on occasion (for example: after the marriage of Miss Taylor Mr. Woodhouse is concerned whether his coachman, James, would be agreeable hitching the horses up to the carriage for such a short trip as the half mile to Randalls. This familiarity with servants would be frowned upon by some other Austen characters like Sir Walter Elliot of ""Persuasion"" or Lady Russell of the same novel.), so this leaves in Emma's upbringing something to be desired according to the standards of the day. Thus, it is not that unusual for her to present a somewhat less than perfect model of behavior. Certainly, the vulgar Mrs. Elton (played by Christina Cole) is as critical of Emma as Emma is of her. Perhaps they see themselves as mirrors of one another as well as social rivals.

  Knightley is played by Jonny Lee Miller, himself a native of Surrey and the same age as the book's character (Knightley is 37; Emma is 16 years his junior; Miller and Garai are 10 years apart). His approach to the character is understated, realistic, layered, and natural. He portrays this Austen hero as a mature, comfortable very un-Darcy-like man. Hinting at a humanist approach, Knightley appears to judge others on their merits rather than their positions (he is friendly with Mr. Cole, although he is ""in trade""), and his observations are handled with a dry wit that would be appreciated in the period. Ever realistic, he casts a blind eye on the merits of poor, Harriet Smith (played by Louise Dylan), later to admit his error. The chemistry between Garai and Miller is natural, fluid, and friendly. I find Romola Garai luminous,radiant and buoyant, this radiance playing off Miller's calm concern. This is not the hidden, grand passion of ""Pride and Prejudice"" where all codes are broken to attain the beloved. It is a marriage of equals and of friends.

  The production itself is radiant with sun dappled fields, snowy landscapes, persimmon colored gowns, gorgeous candlelit interiors, and the obligatory, revelatory Austen ball. How these filmmakers put together these beautiful ballroom scenes and make each one unique is beyond me. The costumes are meticulously accurate in fabric, color, and detail, and appropriate to each character's station in life.

  In all, the adherence to the emotional story of these people, the dynamics of the relationships, whether between family members, friends, or acquaintances, really fleshes out the characters in a way that another treatment might not. Still, my generosity does not extend to a full five stars. That level of perfection I must reserve for two other productions. One is the 1995 theatrical release of ""Persuasion"" with Amanda Root as Anne Elliot and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B00003JRCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>), directed by Roger Michell. The other is the 1980 production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-BBC-1980/dp/B000244FDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)</a>), directed by Cyril Coke. To me, Elizabeth Garvie will always be Elizabeth Bennet and David Rintoul will always be Darcy.

  As for this lovely presentation: the little modernizations of language and behavior (Emma goes unescorted, in the carriage, to the ball; she steps down and stands alone outside the Inn where the ball takes place; not a soul in sight to greet her, help her down, or protect her if she is accosted) do take down the level of Austenian purity but it is made up for with emotional content and sheer beauty (even the musical score is lovely and supportive).

  My earlier standard for ""Emma"" has always the Beckinsale version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma-A-E-1997/dp/0767020308/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma (A&E, 1997)</a>), which for many reasons still remains a favorite, but this newer version will share that position and may-be even overtake it. The beautiful, vibrant love story is wonderfully told without slipping into a gushing, heavy handed romanticism which would be so inappropriate for the period and flavor of Jane Austen's work.",1265587200,33,5848,5.555680539932508

It also contains no subtlety, whatsoever. It spells out every implication of every plot and character shift out loud, in bland, modern English, as if the best they expect from the audience is for them to keep the drool wiped off their chins.

It lacks Jane Austen's dialogue (nearly 75% of the script is new or altered), wit, and charm.

Mr. Knightly, Miss Bates, Mr. Woodhouse, and Harriet were all fine enough.

Jane Fairfax and Mrs. Weston were insipid dopes with two expressions a piece in their pockets.

Frank Churchill is so wretched that when this Emma hoots and delights, preening like a glittery peacock at his flattery, it is clear she is a woman who could never be worthy of Mr. Knightly. It is the first Emma where I actually hoped against all odds that he might end up with Harriet.

It's a great love story however it is packaged. This is  why Clueless (based off this story) was so fun!  There are things I like better in the other versions, but, as a whole, this is my favorite adaptation.  The character of Mr. Knightley, a Jane Austen favorite for me,  is handled well in my estimation.  Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley  has the hard task of starting out like a brother to Emma and slowly transitioning to passionate love interest in a believable way. He does a good job.  Mark Strong (previous BBC version) had a hard time breaking out of older brother and  Jeremy Northam (Hollywood version) never seemed to really start there.

She also looks like a first year undergrad. just arrived at college! Lacking grace and poise. For me, Emma is far more self-assured and haughty, and I think Paltrow captures her character far better.

I've seen her in other productions and thought she was good, so perhaps this is the fault of the director??  Also, have you noticed the proximity of the actors to each other when speaking etc., this is not natural nor is it the behavior of proper folks from the upper class.  The acting was far superior in Emma with G. Paltrow, J. Northam, A. Cumming, J. Stevenson, S. Thompson.  See the older version first then you'll see this is filled with many copy cat performances, most of which cannot compare to the stellar cast in the Paltrow version.  I feel as if I'm watching an acting class production.  It's as if the actors are trying too hard.  It doesn't have the warmth, flow or charm of the Paltrow version.  The only stellar performance so far is by M. Gambon.  He knows what he's about as always. He never over acts, he just is the character he's portraying.

Although I do think this current version is beautiful to watch and I appreciate the scenery, it will never come close to the earlier version. The quality of acting is just not there.  I even prefer the A&E production over this one.

I will not be adding this version of Emma to my collection.  I am so disappointed after reading the glowing reviews in the newspapers.",1264464000,27,1547,4.455516014234876
3943729,4,B002KISB56,"It says something for the enduring qualities of Jane Austen's romantic comedy ""Emma"" that it gets redone every few years for television or the movies.  The latest (2009) BBC production reproduces, more or less faithfully, Jane Austen's novel at a length of four hours, framed by excellent production values and superb period sets, costumes, and carriages.

As the story has it, the rich, handsome and clever Emma Woodhouse imagines herself to be the able matchmaker of the village of Highbury, a role she takes on against the advice of her older and wiser friend Mr. Knightley.  The energetic Emma succeeds mostly in entangling the lives of several people, including her own.  The show offers some excellent comedy wrapped around what is a coming of age journey for Emma.

Romola Garai is an expressive Emma.  Michael Gambon is a very good Mr. Woodhouse, capturing the many quikrs of Jane Austen's original.  Johnny Lee Miller ends up being fairly good Mr. Knightley, even if he looks a little young for the 16 year age difference with Emma, with whom he eventually works up some good chemistry.  The supporting cast is quite good.  Blake Ritson is spot-on as the pretentious Reverend Elton, while Rupert Evans is equally good as Frank Churchill.

This version of ""Emma"" is highly recommended as good entertainment to fans of Jane Austen and of PBS' Masterpiece Theater.",1264377600,,1370,4.969298245614035
3943730,2,B002KISB56,"As a long time Janeite, I've seen all the adaptations, and one thing that is critical for them is to recapture the manners and spirit of the period, and the flavor of the novel.  To me, the best adaptation of Emma to screen is the BBC version with Beckinsdale and Mark Strong, who were perfect as Emma  and Knightly.  Emma in this latest version appears more like a skivvy or a shopgirl in her expressions and manners -  Romola Garai is gauche and gushing - with her abrupt bobbing curtseys and bouncing in and out of chairs and rooms she seems more like a chambermaid in a middle class house than the daughter of a gentleman. How can she be appalled at the middle class Mrs Elton when her own manners and demeanor have none of the polish or poise of a gentlewoman?

One of the characteristics of Emma was that she was very full of her family's position as one of the first in Highbury, which necessarily leads to her imagining Harriet as a gentleman's daughter too good to throw herself away on an otherwise respectable farmer, to her clashes as the Coles attempt to ""move up"" into ""first class"" society  - something the rest of her set -- Knightly, the Bates -- have no issue with, or her rejection of Elton and Mrs Elton.  Emma's expressions, posture, even her hair, are entirely out of character for this important point in the novel.

Knightly (Johhny Lee Miller) appears too young  -- you don't get the sense there is the necessary 16 year difference that is essential to maintaining the initial romantic distance between them.  He also doesn't have the inherant dignity and decorum that is Knightly.  The whole cast appears skewed to 2010 values in demeanor.  Jane Fairfax had a great deal of revealing expressions for someone who is supposed to be so reserved.

On the pluses, Mr. Woodhouse is rather good, but he's been doing this sort of period work often in his career, and understands the requirements.  The rest of the cast is passable.

The best adaptations also use as much of the books narrative and dialogue as possible.  Unfortunately the author of this screenplay, unlike Andrew Davies, chose to put her words in the character's mouths.  The dialogue doesn't have the cadence of the original, and the dumbing down of the expressions to 2010 speech is a serious annoyance for those of us who love the irony and wit in Jane Austen's turns of phrase.

Still, the film is pretty to look at and it is passable. But if the point of putting Jane Austen to film is to recreate Jane Austen, it would help to take some care to make it Jane Austen, in characters, in mores, and in period. Emma and Knightly have been brought forward too much and lost their essential natures. This flawed adaptation reminds me of the recent adaptation of Mansfield Park, -- if not as bad -- where they substantially transformed the heroine and the dialogue to 21st century standards.  I'm sure there are people who will like this more populist version of Emma, but it doesn't work for me.  For other purists, again, I'd recommend the BBC Beckinsdale version, which is unfortunately a much shortened version of the book, but still captures better its tone and spirit. I can only hope someday someone does a more faithful adaptation of my favorite Jane Austen novel.  In the interim, this is worth a rental, if not a purchase.",1264377600,178,3315,4.613287904599659
3943731,5,B002KISB56,"I will admit it. I've never really liked Emma as story. It's the truth. I always felt she was arrogant and a little ridiculous. While I, of course, appreciate the humor and comedic moments, I just never fell in love with the characters. . . until I watched this little gem. In this film Johnny Lee Miller is an absolute dream as the practical, patient, opinionated Mr. Knightley--wonderfully full of angst, a bit of jealousy, and good, noble intentions. Emma was likeable, even loveable. You see why she does what she does, and how she develops and learns. You see how her worldview has been colored by her doting, but very overprotective father, who never let her out of his sight. You see why Mr. Knightley lectures her and what behaviors she exhibits around Mr. Frank Churchill that he abhors. And they argue. a lot. Delicious, frustration-tinged argue. It's wonderful. I also love that you are given more access to Jane Fairfax and Harriet Smith and especially Miss Bates. You see her perpetually optimistic chatter as a means of warding off the insufferable loneliness and hopeliness of her situation, making Emma's mockery all the more potent and hurtful. Her preoccupation with Jane's accomplishments are a way to comfort and to assure her that she and her mother did the right thing in sending her away, giving her wonderful opportunities (and that those opportunities might one day be a way out of penury for herself and her mother). As Miss Bates chatters, Mrs. Bates falls more and more silent--the one trying to balance out the other. All characters evolves; you see it. Harriet is sweet and innocent. Mrs. Elton is snobbish and bossy. It is a wonderful, wonderful adaptation, both comedic and dramatic and especially romantic.",1264291200,13,1739,4.898305084745763
3943732,4,B002KISB56,"I really, really enjoyed this version of Emma, although there were a few aspects of it that I didn't really agree with. First, the good! JLMiller's Knightley is my favorite by far! He's not too wishy-washy, not too stern - he finds a perfect balance between boyish charm and firm, quiet manly goodness :). I thought Romola Garai was quite good as Emma as well, although at times I was a bit put off by her slightly modern mannerisms. Almost everyone else was really well cast - I especially appreciated that Ms. Bates wasn't portrayed as a complete fool (in the other films she seemed more like a caricature than a character to me).
Now the bad: Emma's modern mannerisms. Things like plopping down on sofas, and generally being a bit lacking in the grace department. If she thought so highly of herself, it seems to me she would have been a bit more self-aware.
Also, Mr. Woodhouse. He was just depressing. In the book he's portrayed as a lovable, slightly silly, worried old man, and I really thought Michael Gambon would do a really good job playing him, but I felt that his performance fell rather flat. I just felt uneasy and depressed watching him.
The last aspect I have an issue with is the script. It's a great script, but I would really like to have seen more of Jane Austen's witty dialogue in there. The script seems to rely a little too heavily on new ideas of humor, or to leave it out altogether. I just don't understand why more of Austen's subtle humor couldn't be included.
That said, overall I thought it was a really good adaptation, with a (mostly) spot-on cast, great acting, decent script, beautiful sets and costumes, and a lovely score. Oh, and I haven't mentioned the best part - people play the piano and sing, and it actually sounds like they're singing! There's no sudden prima-donna-on-a-sound-stage moment. That is a thing of beauty rarely experienced in most period movies. Five stars for that, minus one for slight character and script flaws.",1263600000,153,1974,4.659025787965616
3943733,5,B002KISB56,"This version of Emma is definitely my new fav.  Romola Garai is great as Emma Wodehouse, a spoiled, conceited, even at times manipulative wanna-be matchmaker but she still manages to be pretty darn likeable.  I also liked that this version took the time to examine the lives of the other characters a bit more deeply.  Of course, in true BBC style, the sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, and every actor tailor made for their parts.  Very well done!!",1263513600,9,459,4.7
3943734,5,B002KISB56,"It is so lovely to sit down to a period piece where one can simply watch human drama unfold without crassness and general degeneracy intervening and without being plagued by technology, noise and rubbish dialogue.  So, this is a real treat with the story unfolding over 4 episodes giving plenty of time for human drama and maturation to take place.  This is what the BBC do best!  What can one say but that I came away from this piece feeling that life was good and that human beings could indeed be generous, magnanimous and loving.  Bravo!!!",1263168000,16,543,4.625

I now all the actors from previous works and the casting was brilliantly done, to say the least.  There is one comment about Gwyneth Paltrow's ""fake British accent"" which does not ring true.  Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent is not fake in any shape or form.  Gwyneth was raised by her mother,Blythe Danner,an excellent British actor in her own right.  Gwyneth's British accent is flawless, to say the least. You will read more from me after I watch the new Emma!",1262736000,6,637,4.584070796460177

8372007,5,B002KISB56,"Perhaps one of the very best Jane Austen adaptions out there. The ""condensing"" of the story (not an easy feat with a full Jane Austen novel) is superb. Often for the sake of filming, characters and supporting stories are cut, however with this particular version of Emma they were able to incorporate many of the smaller supporting stories (at the very beginning of the movie) to help fill out why and what the characters are in the bigger tale.

The acting is excellent. Experience Jonny Lee Miller before Trainspotting fame and the current programme Elementary.

Highly recommend as a wonderful period movie and definitely if you are an Austen fan.",1527811200,,650,4.9

8372011,2,B002KISB56,"Emma's probably my favorite Austen heroine. Unfortunately, this adaptation completely fails to capture her breezy charm, making her feel annoyingly melodramatic. The choices they make in regards to Frank are very odd and uncomfortable. The pacing is awkward, especially near the end. You'd think with all the time given to ""deepen"" the characters, you could at least spend a little bit on Emma's torment of mind when she think's she's lost Mr. Knightley, but that's almost criminally glossed over. Overall, trying to introduce extra drama (never the best of ideas in Austen) detracts from the mood and kills most of the wit.
The people who like this version are probably the same ones that preferred Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet to Jennifer Ehle's. One thing you'll notice about a lot of the 5 star reviews is they all say it's the best adaptation of their least favorite Austen. That's all well and good, but if you love Emma like I do you're liable to come out of this series vaguely disappointed. Better than 1 star, but still... badly done, Emma. Badly done.",1526083200,,1068,4.906077348066298
8372012,5,B002KISB56,"This is, by far, my favorite version of Emma. The character progression in the story is so subtle that I think only a miniseries could capture it. This version really shows the nuance and complexity of the story. An argument could be made that the mannerisms are a bit too modern and informal for the period. I just couldn't care less, honestly. And Tamsin's Mrs. Bates is so brilliant- just wow.
