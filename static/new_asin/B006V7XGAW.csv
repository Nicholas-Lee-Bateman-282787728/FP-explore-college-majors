8504909,4,B006V7XGAW,"[GIRL IN CAPTIVITY; PSYCHO TORTURE CHAMBER - 2008 - 74 minutes - Japanese w/ English subtitles] This entry from Cinema Epoch's Tokyo Erotique series is better than some of their other releases, as it avoids most of the clichd story traps we've come to accept as part of our Asian exploitation adventures. Not your typical women in prison, cages, forced factory slaves or nympho killing machines - not that I'm critical of such trash; after all, how do you think I became Dr. NoItAll in various exploitation circles?  (And I'm still not certain this is something I should be proud or shamed of...).

A cute Asian teen (possibly very young adult) awakens in a strange boiler room, chained to pipes, realizing she's been kidnapped by possibly the most bizarre captor I've seen (outside of a horror torture porn flick) - what appears to be a Sumo wrestler with a gas mask and voice camouflage who enters the room like he's headed for a WWF cage fight.  Thankfully for the teen, this isn't the case; it's just a bout of fondling and ""Getting to know you, getting to know all about you"", before he does a few Sumo warm-ups, demanding that she ""Cheer for him... with vivacity"", then exits, stage left.

The hostage is the daughter of a tycoon who's on the verge of a large corporate merger in Beijing and might be being blackmailed for an ongoing affair he's been having with his personal secretary - but the kidnapper's true intentions are kept mysterious. The negotiations boil down to ""Cancel the merger and I release your daughter"" - it's obvious the kidnapper knows the father, but from where?

Not to worry, we're treated to twofold sexcapades - sexual scenarios of the father's infidelities with his secretary as well as those between hostage and captor. The first is fairly straightforward, the second fairly perverse. Nothing heinous or horribly shocking though (then again, I'm numb to a lot of bats*** crazy stuff). Add a bit of Stockholm Syndrome, a surprise identity revealed, some more flesh, a few deaths and an almost touching ending and you have a slightly different take on transgressive cinema. It's worth a gander for those reasons alone. And, thankfully, there's no real torture going on. I was sick of that drivel years ago.

This is much better than the 'Girl in Captivity; Hitwoman in Chains 2' IMO. In the final analysis, it's just more Asian exploitation, or `Exploit-Asian' as I call it, but if you've read this far, we're choir mates, so sing for the psycho and the `Girl in Captivity'. 4 stars (for this genre entry).",1361059200,11,2539,4.7722095671981775
