1885230,4,B00009MEEN,"A monumental film of the old Romans after the famous novel of Edward George Bulwer.

The film belonged in my young days (the sixties) to my favorite films. I admired particularly the good-looking Steve Reeves because of its

body. His partner  was the young Christine Kaufmann, which became later woman of Tony Curtis. The movie-biographies are incomplete, the film were revised at sound and picture.  Last Days of Pompeii is absolutely comparable with movies at this time like The Robe"" or

Quo Vadis"", maybe we miss only famous names of these films.",1101081600,10,551,4.945652173913044
1885231,4,B00009MEEN,"Overall one of Steve Reeves best movies. Certainly his most lavish. Good sets, great arena scenes and quite a good ending showing (some of) the actual horrors of Pompeii'a destruction. Sure it's sword and sandel. But it's one of the best with some exciting action sequences.  Mike Markowski....Dorchester, Ma.",1096761600,11,309,5.3061224489795915
1885232,1,B00009MEEN,"We had read with interest the review from another person that gave the movie one star, and still thought we would try it ourselves.  The movie is set for wide-screen so you miss most of the action.  The acting is below average.  We just returned from Pompeii and looked forward to seeing some scenery of how Pompeii looked prior to the volcano, but the setting was not of Pompeii.  The plot was good and with good acting and directing, the movie could have been interesting.  As it was, we cannot recommend it to anyone.",1093564800,8,520,4.48936170212766
1885233,1,B00009MEEN,"As a big fan of the Sword'n'Sandal genre I had really been looking forward to owning this movie, as I had seen it rated by many people as being THE best movie of this type.
Well first of all, I was extremely upset to find that this is yet another case of a lush, beautiful late 50s/early 60s period piece super-duper deluxe WIDE SCREEN movie being released in an el-cheapo panned and scanned FULL SCREEN version. In this movie's case, the vista must have been extra-wide, because it seems that at least 1/2 of the picture is missing at all times. Thus I found it IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy a viewing of this DVD. Not only that, but the print of the movie used is in extremely faded and poor condition.
This DVD boasts that as a bonus it also contains the full 1913 silent version. The print of the 1913 movie is in equally abysmal shape.
As for the movie itself, although it is very highly rated by many people, I personally did not enjoy it as much as Reeves' other flicks. The story centres around some oh so goody two-shoes Christians in Pompeii who are being persecuted by the oh so evil, underhanded and two-timing head priest of the local heathen-god worshipping temple and his equally heathen and Godless henchmen. I guess if you're a hard-core Christian you may enjoy it, but I found myself gritting my teeth at times at the utterly preachy plot.
It should be mentioned that this story was also made into a TV mini-series in 1984, and although it shared the same stilted plot with this movie, I found that it was still much more entertaining, enjoyable and watchable than this rather plodding and dated version. If the 1984 mini-series were to come out on DVD (hint, hint, DVD making people out there) --remastered and the FULL uncut mini-series that is--, I would be interested in owning it, what with its high production values and good actors.
As for this movie, if you're a Steve Reeves fan or a fan of 50s/60s Italian Sword'n'Sandal flicks you will probably still like it, but I would recommend waiting till a better DVD version is made. The lazy people who put out this present horrible version do not deserve to get another penny of anyone else's money.",1077580800,92,2161,4.543589743589743
1885234,5,B00009MEEN,"This 1960 version of ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" has a much more subtle style than most films or shows of this type. There is violence, blood, and hints of other ancient Roman debauchery, but it was (and is) mild enough to be seen at a kiddie matinee when I was about 8 years old. A beardless Steve Reeves is great in his role, as are the other actors. It was odd that during the volcanic climax there was no lava or volcanic ash anywhere (there was a little flowing mud). Overall, it is a good flashback made better by an excellent print in widescreen.",1489881600,3,552,4.266666666666667

1885246,1,B00009MEEN,"""The Last Days of Pompeii"" is a movie I automatically damn with faint praise: at least it isn't as bad as the book.

And no, it isn't. But this Italian adaptation of Lord Bulwer-Lytton's soggy overbloated mess of a novel isn't that good either -- the actual eruption of Pompeii doesn't actually have much to do with the main plot, which involves a tortured muscle-man who ends up in the middle of a really incoherent conspiracy involving Christians. The plot is incoherent, the acting is hilariously bad, and a legendary volcanic eruption serves merely as a halfhearted coda.

Upon returning Pompeii, young Centurion Glaucus (Steve Reeves) is enraged to find his father murdered and his home ransacked. Since these attackers leave a crude cross on the wall of every place they attack, everybody assumes (in true Neroian tradition) that Christians are responsible. After all, nobody else could scrawl a cross on a wall, could they?

But after his friend Marcus is mysteriously murdered in the temple of Isis, Glaucus becomes convinced that the Christians are actually being framed. Not because he's open-minded or smart or anything -- he's just become enamored of a hot Christian girl, Ione (Christine Kaufmann). Ione says that Christians couldn't have done it because all Christians are nice people, and that's good enough for a guy who thinks with his biceps.

But when Glaucus tries to alert Ione's dad to this frame-up, he finds himself attacked by assassins, framed for murder, and finally accused of being in league with the Christians (who spend most of their time sniveling). Oh, and eventually the volcano erupts. Spoiler.

Admittedly sword-and-sandal epics are not my forte, but it is a genuine chore to sit through ""Last Days of Pompeii."" Most of the movie involves people just sort of wandering around talking, and occasionally Steve Reeves gets into heavily-choreographed fights because... well, when you have Steve Reeves in a movie, it's a waste to not have him beat up a cartoonishly evil villain for trying to rape a blind slave.

The biggest problem is the plot, which is riddled with massive plot holes. In the last act, the villain suddenly unveils herself and reveals her whole sinister plan... which is based on hatred for Rome that we've never seen, because of backstory we've never heard of, and with an army of loyal followers who have no real reason to follow her. Her plan? Overthrow the entire Roman Empire using a cache of treasure small enough to fit in a backpack.

What does this have to do with the Christians? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But that doesn't mean that the movie won't have more religious content than most actual religious movies. For some reason, all the evil Romans worship Isis instead of their own pantheon, and there are many scenes of people talking about God and Christianity and how wonderful they are because... reasons.

Oh, and that volcanic eruption that destroyed two major cities and killed over FIFTEEN THOUSAND people? It's tacked on hastily during the final fight scene, as if the filmmakers belatedly remembered ""Oh yeah, that happened!"" and threw in some stock footage. It's presented so halfheartedly -- there's no volcanic gas or earthquakes, just the buildings randomly falling apart FOR NO REASON.

Steve Reeves is effective as a mass of muscles, but he's kind of miscast here -- the role of Glaucus actually requires some acting, since he's supposed to show subtle shades of vengeful anger, love, desperation, and so on. He's honestly at his best when he's slaying lions.

Most of the other characters are delightfully two-dimensional. We have a slew of Glaucus's friends who are barely even named, a thief who has no other characteristics, a pure-hearted Christian girl who exists just to make sure the hero will convert, and her blind slave girl. No, I don't know why someone would buy a blind slave. Most of the acting ranges from earnestly mediocre to hilariously awful.

It's good for a friendly riffing party, but ""Last Days of Pompeii"" is too embarrassingly awful for any other purpose -- especially if you're a fan of plots that make sense. Just don't read the book.",1400284800,,4145,4.95821325648415
1885247,4,B00009MEEN,"Let's be very honest, these types of sword and sandal Italian made ""epics"" with Steve Reeves and company are very simply, what they are. there will be no Academy Awards or accolades at all.

1885248,5,B00009MEEN,"Hot ladies and dudes with swords. That's all I have to say.

Acting is typical of the area. I do warn that the movie gets a bit preachy, given that it was set during the Roman persecution of the Christians at Pompeii.",1387152000,,217,4.166666666666667

1885250,5,B00009MEEN,"Not bad Steve Reeves sword-and-sandal epic.  The story is no different from any other of this genre.  The volcano blows its top in the last 15 minutes.  Everything before is political intrigue and persecution of Christians.  My complements are for the quality of this DVD release.  It has no extras, but it is in widescreen, the picture is clear, the sound is fine and the color is beautiful.  The cover art is great.  This is the best DVD release of a sword-and-sandal film I have ever seen.  The logo on the back of the case says Hollywood's Attic.  I highly recommend this version to fans of the genre.",1381104000,2,605,4.527777777777778
1885251,5,B00009MEEN,"I had been looking for this movie on DVD for several months.  I love this historical drama set amidst the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, which buried the city of Pompeii, Italy.  The picture quality on the DVD is okay.  It definitely shows its age, but the story is very good.  The last 15 minutes when the eruption occurs is very exciting.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys classic disaster films.",1371600000,2,410,4.561643835616438
1885252,5,B00009MEEN,"This Steve Reeves remake of a 1930's disaster classic is surprisingly a good transfer onto DVD.  This sure fits well into my fantasy films collection!

1885255,5,B00009MEEN,"Steeve Reeves was the highest paid actor there was at the peek of his career as a movie star. Former body builder turned actor Steeve paved the way for others like Lou Ferregno and Arnold schwartzenhagger. Steeve was a true self made man never touching steriods and promoting a healthy drug free life style he pumped out sword and sandal films as much as he pumped iron. This is one of my favorites of his. I'm not 100% sure but I think his debut film was Hercules. In this film Mr. Reeves battles the romans ,Lions and a alligator as he fights to protect his cristian friends who are being framed by the Romans in Pompeii the film climaxes with a blast as he helps said friends escape the biggest apponate of all a volcano. This movie and ""the giant of Marathon"" and ""Duel of the titans"" are among my favorite Reeves films. Sergio Leon offered steeve the starring role in a western trilogoy, he turned it down and Clint Eastwood got the part in ""A fistfull of dollars"", "" For a few dollars more"" and ""The good The bad and The Ugly"". Sergio Leon's man with no name character launched Clints Carreer into super stardom.",1355011200,6,1118,4.432038834951456

1885258,5,B00009MEEN,"The plot is actually quite deep, despite some of the comments. It deals with the early opression of christians and is (within dramatic license) historically acurate. If you hate christians, then I can see why there might be some bad reviews. But un biggoted views aside, it is an -extrodinary movie, One of reeves best. It is actually one of the most thought provocing as well. But if its a rambo-like movie you want, this is not it. This is more of an artistic work of historical fiction. it does have great action also though, but the movie is not centered around this.",1237852800,3,571,4.553398058252427
1885259,2,B00009MEEN,"This 1959 ""Last Days"" was a cooperative production between four European nations, and partially scripted/directed by Sergio Leone. The highlight of course is the anticipated event, Mt. Vesuvius erupting. Bodybuilder Steve Reeves is oiled and in his prime in this (minus the volcano) otherwise typical swords, sandals and togas outing.

Reeves is a Roman tribune who returns to Pompeii while on extended leave from the legions. He learns his father's been murdered and the story becomes an exercise in investigation and plotted revenge until Vesuvius sends our hero running for his life. Decent special effects (for its day) in the big disaster scene; points added for beautiful people, scenery, costumes.

Now the major downside:
Pre-recorded VHS tapes manufactured in the SP mode play just fine in most well-maintained machines. Those done in LP and SLP do not. GOODTIMES always used the slower tape speeds, therefore this version of LAST DAYS OF POMPEII is NOT recommended.

(For more details and a good review, see the film's entry at imdb.com.) On the minus side, this a narrated version with a rather hokey voice-over and, though it does not appear to be censored, it does seems to be missing some frames here and there. Despite the less than ideal condition of this print, the 1926 version is so rare, and so worth watching, that seeing it on this DVD will still be a treat for interested viewers.
