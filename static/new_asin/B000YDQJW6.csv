8311193,2,B000YDQJW6,Not a serious about Ping Pong video. Don't buy it!!!,1455321600,,52,4.3
8311194,5,B000YDQJW6,"Though this probably won't appeal to the hardcore Table Tennis player, it is hilarious. The premise is basically ping pong in an apartment with crazy players, hot female referee's, comedian commentators, oh and drinking rules. Everyone has to do shots when they miss a shot, or get slammed on. What really makes this so funny is the commentators who bash everyone, insult everyone, and make the funniest comments I've ever heard. If you like stupid humor, good looking girls, and drinking, this is definitely worth checking out.",1215648000,,528,5.080459770114943
