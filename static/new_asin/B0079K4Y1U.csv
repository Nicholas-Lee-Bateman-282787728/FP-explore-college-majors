5066619,5,B0079K4Y1U,Daughter rented this movie from Red Box and loved it. She asked to have this movie as one of her birthday presents. She loves dogs and the story is sweet. Worth purchasing.,1352678400,5,172,4.40625
5066620,5,B0079K4Y1U,"Cinnamon is a heartwarming movie that a family can sit down to, without all the cursing and sex of the new blockbusters that are out now. For all you dog lovers (me included) that look at your dogs as part of the family---you will be able to relate. Cinnamon (a spoiled female Maltese)doesn't want her mommy to fall in love, thinking she won't get as much attention and love. She does everything she can, but then falls in love with the guy and his family herself. The dog has a voice over, and it's cute......bring the popcorn.",1343260800,7,528,4.453608247422681
5066621,3,B0079K4Y1U,"'Cinnamon' aka 'My Dog's Christmas Miracle'(although there's not too much about Christmas here)is a lightweight, corny, predictable romantic comedy(RC) that's actually entertaining.

Nuts and bolts of story: a divorced woman and her beloved Cinnamon meet the potential love of her life in widowed architect, Kevin and his son.  There's definite chemistry, but the dog feels threatened at losing her master's attention and goes about disrupting the relationship.

One can hear what the animals are thinking.  Cinnamon has an annoying voice that goes with her character, but the dog's cute and our kids liked her.  The more trouble she does the more they like her.  Go figure.

The actors are ok with some veterans. Cynthia Gibb(I remember her from 'Youngblood' with Rob Lowe.  Yikes, does that date me!) portrays the somewhat scattered heroine.  Robert Carradine plays an irritating professor.  Leslie-Anne Down has a role as an aunt.

It's basically by the numbers, and if you like mindless RC's, like we do from time to time, you'll probably like this one.  There's no language, violence, or sex, well, there's some smooching by the leads that the kids roll their eyes at, and there is some teen dating and mild family issues.

Nothing new or outstanding, but then again, it's unusual to get to watch an RC that the kids will sit for.",1337299200,7,1335,5.013636363636364

5066686,3,B0079K4Y1U,It was fun to watch but leans more toward older kids.  Precious dog.  It shows that some adults  can really get wrapped up in their pets.  A man and woman meet and are attracted to each other but her dog has other ideas.  As you can see the dog does her own narration in the movie.  I must admit that by the middle of the movie I wanted to put a muzzle on her.  Yapping dogs bother me.  But I'm sure any dog lover would enjoy it.,1403395200,,429,3.8505747126436782
5066687,4,B0079K4Y1U,"My kid loved it and we liked little violence factor. If the daughter showed less cleavage would have 5 stars as it bothered my other daughter.

5066730,5,B0079K4Y1U,This is a very cute movie from a dog's perspective. It was funny listening to the dog tell his life story.,1383436800,,106,4.095238095238095
5066731,2,B0079K4Y1U,"Amazing to see a complete disregard to represent today's population in a simple movie. Forget trying to identify with your audience.

In essence:

If you're Latina, you can identify with the maid (haven't seen that before).
If you're any other minority (except Asian) you can identify with a T.S.A. officer, perhaps an airline agent, or just some extra that happened to walk by the camera.
If you're Asian, I'm glad to see there are so many architects out there.
African-Americans barely got on camera let alone utter a line.
If you're white, finally; good jobs, Architects, Professors, or just simply not working but having a great life somewhere in Beverly Hills suburbia. That sure is L.A. though, not one minority in sight for most of the movie.

Seriously, this is a family and children's movie... I would like my child to know diversity, to identify and see that people other than template white can have serious and important jobs. Or, dare I ask for an Asian or white maid?",1376092800,,981,4.792899408284024

5066738,3,B0079K4Y1U,"CINNAMON is an enjoyable family film that follows the familiar formula of similar tales, adding ""talking"" animals to the mix.
The most annoying aspect is the awful electronic music that sounds straight out of the eighties.
The cast is good in their clich roles:  Cynthia Gibb as the dog-spoiling mom; Greg Evigan is the widowed dad; and lovely Lesley-Anne Down as the doting aunt.
It's all silly and predictable, but it should entertain both kids and patient adults.",1352851200,,466,4.9743589743589745

Cinnamon the movie is a delight from start to finish. We watched it after Christmas Day lunch and it was great fun and very well acted by all concerned especially Cinnamon the dog.
