5459733,5,B00ANGIC4W,"This movie is about a transsexual teen and her harsh new journey after her father gets out of prison. However, even though the father is the destructive force, who in many ways pushes the teen into defending and demanding her sexual identity even more, his journey is also depicted on screen in a way to get the audience to relate on a basic level. Therefore, the most potent feeling in the movie is pain instead of say pity or disgust. The viewer can experience the pain felt by the overly abused teen, and the pain the father feels as he acts on what he believes will help while also dealing with a world that treats him just as badly. In the end, its a movie that accepts transsexual identity, but from which perspective, one of reluctant tolerance or personal need, is up to the viewer to decide.",1362873600,8,800,4.448979591836735
5459734,5,B00ANGIC4W,"I saw this movie over a year ago and have been awaiting to finally be able to add this to my collection. The release date has changed several times and not sure why it has not been released yet as this came out before ""Pariah"" and that was available on DVD last year.

Gun Hill Road is an interesting story about family dynamics along with the evolution of adolescence and how someone who is different has to deal with societal views intermingled with family perception. It is a true coming of age story in the genre of alternative lifestyles. Definitely, a must see for the evolved and free thinker.

I just hope that it is released as described this time and not delayed any longer.",1358640000,5,684,4.464
5459745,4,B00ANGIC4W,"""Gun Hill Road"" tells a tale that goes beyond cultural values, into the heart of what makes us special as human beings.
Esai Morales is customarily fine as a father trying to re-connect after a stint in jail. Imagine his surprise when his dreams are smashed to discover his son has gone a different route than he'd hoped for. He struggles to understand, but can't get it in his head.

The film works well, as we get to know the son, brilliantly played by Harmony Santana. I haven't heard much of Ms Santana since she made this film; almost like she went the way of Jaye Davidson after ""The Crying Game"". Pity.

Another film released that same year, ""Pariah"", deals with somewhat similar subject matter, though in that case, the father is more sympathetic than the mother. Still, a courageous effort for all involved.",1400976000,2,816,4.659722222222222
5459746,4,B00ANGIC4W,"I have heard about and read reviews on this film.
Most of the reviews were positive.
I rate this film 3 1/2 stars for the acting alone.",1394409600,,135,4.037037037037037
5459747,3,B00ANGIC4W,"Left us in suspense at the end, what happened after he got arrested a 2nd time? Is there a part two coming up?",1392336000,,110,3.8260869565217392
5459748,5,B00ANGIC4W,"I feel this movie is a must see for anyone wanting to learn about the Transgender struggle and how culture/status plays a role in shaping Transgender individual.
  Overall the characters were great and showed real emotion which I felt helped me understand the struggle that Harmony Santana was going through in her youth.
  This movie tells a story that I feel will help people be more understanding and aware of what Transgender individuals have to go through.
  The movie was so good, that I wish they made a part 2.",1390262400,,518,4.7
5459749,3,B00ANGIC4W,"I chose this rating for several reasons. I enjoy watching Esai Morales act in ANY movie. I am a huge fan. However the movie didn't end the way I expected and there were some ""loose"" ends pending....leaving viewers with unanswered questions. Nevertheless I'm glad I purchased it.",1389744000,,278,4.9361702127659575
5459750,4,B00ANGIC4W,I rented this movie 3 times to watch with three different people in three different places because the experience of this watching should be shared if at all the potential viewers are willing to open their minds and empathize and celebrate the imperfect beings we are whether in transition or watching someone who is transitioning beyond the confines of a previous life.,1383091200,,370,4.983870967741935
5459751,5,B00ANGIC4W,This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. I can relate to it so much!! Only problem is amazon failed to inform me that my purchase went through when it said that my purchase didn't go through. So I pretty much paid for a rental of this for no reason and bought it on itunes instead. Thanks a lot amazon for waisting my money!! -__-,1376179200,,336,4.029850746268656
5459752,5,B00ANGIC4W,"I thought that the acting and the story were incredible. Esai Morales was so convincing that I was angry at his character throughout the film. If you want a tear jerker, this is it!",1372723200,2,181,4.352941176470588
5459753,5,B00ANGIC4W,I THINK THIS MOVIE HAD A GREAT MESSAGE & I WOULD RECOMMEND IT... NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 16 AS AN F.Y.I,1372032000,,98,3.7142857142857144
5459754,4,B00ANGIC4W,it was very interesting movie to watch.... if your curious about how a father really feels about having a gay son and want to know if the father would ever accept him as bring gay....,1371686400,,183,4.257142857142857
5459783,5,B00ANGIC4W,"movie/flick,about hard times&real life drama situations,almost mirrors the other movie with Benjamin Bratt(La Mission),Except this one's set in New York",1369612800,,152,6.65
5459784,2,B00ANGIC4W,"I would rather chew cut glass than sit through this film again. The characters lack enough intelligence (or common sense) and sufficient motivation to be realistic.
I am a fan of Esai Morales, but his character is such a thug in this film, that it is impossible for me to like the movie.",1368921600,,287,4.433962264150943
5459785,3,B00ANGIC4W,It didn't seem finished. I expected more from Esai Morales. He's one of my favorite actors and cute to boot!,1368144000,,108,4.45
5459786,5,B00ANGIC4W,This movie was excellent. I did not like the way it ended but there were so many reasons and stories that all can relate too. Punishing your child because of their choice for who they choice to be in life is called live and learn not punish and hate. Down Low is shown on many levels that should wake up many young ladies and women in the choices as well they make in their lives. At the end of the day it is about free will and choices. Good work Esai. Look forward to seeing more from you.,1366761600,,491,4.020408163265306
5459787,2,B00ANGIC4W,"Enrique (Esai Morales) gets out of prison after three years. He doesn't want to violate his parole and go back, but the cards are stacked against him. His wife Angela (Judy Reyes) had taken on a lover (Vincent Laresca) which Enrique is understanding and forgiving, but now it must be over. Their son Michael (Harmony Santana) prefers to be called Vanessa. Angela is supportive of him, while Enrique is as confused as a rabbit in the headlights.

And that is pretty much the story. The action and plot are light. I imagine the film is supposed to deal with growing up transvestite in a poor Hispanic neighborhood, but it misses the mark on that. As I kept waiting for the film to start they rolled the end credits. The film was well acted with some interesting scenes, but there was no hook.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex. Brief opaque side shower nudity.",1366243200,,861,4.657894736842105
5459788,3,B00ANGIC4W,This is a very well acted movie of a rather mundane story.  Esai Morales and the other actors brought life to what is just a so-so story.,1365206400,2,137,4.074074074074074
5459789,5,B00ANGIC4W,"I cannot believe I knew this writer/director as a child!  Hope your future is very successful, Mr. Green!  This film was awesome!",1365120000,3,129,4.818181818181818
5459790,5,B00ANGIC4W,"It was worth the wait... I missed all the screenings for this movie in NYC, and then had to wait for the DVD. But I was all worth it. This is an excellent movie for those LGBT teens that just don't know what to do when it comes to parents. I would and have recommended this movie.",1364947200,2,280,3.9298245614035086
5459791,5,B00ANGIC4W,This film covers a great deal of social intersectionality. The story is handled incredibly well and creates a beautiful experience.,1364083200,2,131,5.6
5459792,4,B00ANGIC4W,"I have been waiting to see this film for awhile now, and I thought that Mr. Ernesto did a great job on his first feature, there was good acting and a strong storyline.  I can't wait to see his new work!!!",1363046400,3,204,3.975609756097561
8554695,5,B00ANGIC4W,This was a beautifu done movie that I would highly recommend.  Transitioning it not only hard for the individual but also the family.,1519948800,,133,4.782608695652174
8554696,3,B00ANGIC4W,Could have been better. Esai has the same stone face throughout the entire movie.,1508371200,,81,4.857142857142857
8554697,5,B00ANGIC4W,"A very real story about being transgender today. Very moving and real. Great acting by all the stars, especially Esai Morales and Harmony Santana. I only wish this digital Amazon version had X-Ray. Highly recommended.",1477440000,,217,5.228571428571429

8554699,3,B00ANGIC4W,"I remember reading uniformly good reviews of this movie and the storyline sounded compelling, plus I've long been a fan of Esai Morales.  We rented the movie today (from Amazon) and it was a *huge* disappointment; it was absolutely one of the most boring movies we've ever watched.  I will say, however, that Harmony Santana gave a credible performance.",1448755200,,353,4.966101694915254

8554703,5,B00ANGIC4W,"Same as above, but I like La Mission better!
Both movies are good in that they address a REAL ISSUE and by the movies being so real with the issue matter it makes it a better movie!
