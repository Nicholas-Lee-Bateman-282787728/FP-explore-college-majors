2199976,5,B00073SK8E,This is a very good movie and I watch it quite often.  The actors perform in a way that you feel they are living the role.  The movie shows how lives can intertwine and people can give to one another.,1290988800,,200,3.975
2199977,5,B00073SK8E,"This movie was GREAT!!  Those older men were really wonderful to the pregnant girl.

I loved the movie and showed it to other people and they loved it also.",1252454400,12,156,4.344827586206897
2199978,5,B00073SK8E,One of the very few books to make it to the screen with its original story intact. Great movie from a great book by Haruf and a great movie version by Hallmark.,1238112000,15,160,4.03125
2199979,1,B00073SK8E,The book is wonderful.this movie doesn't even come close.it was a big disappointment.i am sorry I wasted my money on it,1398124800,,119,4.714285714285714
2199980,5,B00073SK8E,"I read the book, and when I saw it was a movie, I just had to have it. This movie remains VERY faithful to the book and is perfectly cast.",1377216000,,138,3.6333333333333333
2199981,5,B00073SK8E,The DVD came before the date it was promised and was in the condition promised. I got it because I was reading a book with the same title and I thought I recognized the story line. So I put in the name on amazon and  it came back that there had been a movie made by Hallmark Hall of Fame. I have watched every Hallmark film ever done so I knew where I had seen it. I ordered it to see if it was true to the story line and it seemed to be.,1375660800,,438,3.6595744680851063
2199982,5,B00073SK8E,"I dude's this movie.  Had to fast forward through commercials and of course wonder what was cut from the movie in order to fit it in the box.  I found that I loved this movie even more than I remember.  Even my husband watched it with me and THAT is saying a lot for the grit of the movie.  He usually reads serial killer books.
I hope you will give sweet movie a chance. The theory that family doesn't' t always come com blood is proven here.",1375056000,,443,4.057471264367816
2199983,4,B00073SK8E,"Not of the typical Hallmark quality. Some aspects missing to really delve into the character's and give us more of a back story. For example, we never find out what the problem is with the mother, Aidan Quinn's wife and why she leaves the family - depression? Don't know. Never find out what is up with the bully and what drives him. I could go on.",1362441600,2,348,4.287878787878788
2199984,4,B00073SK8E,Good movie.  Quality and all was good.  There are movies I've enjoyed more; but this one was good and i'm sure I will watch it again and enjoy it.,1361577600,2,146,4.0
2199985,3,B00073SK8E,The dvd skips and stops about 2 or 3 times while playing and you have to fast forward to get it going again,1360108800,2,107,3.6956521739130435
2199986,5,B00073SK8E,"Unlike many Hollywood's movies today, this movie takes you to a place to where some of us long to belong. It is a great family movie. Highly recommended.",1360022400,3,153,4.5
2199987,5,B00073SK8E,"Like so many Hallmark movies, this is a wonderful and touching movie the family can enjoy together. Some lighthearted and humorous moments added even more to the overall story. My daughter and I loved watching it together.",1348963200,6,222,5.027027027027027
2199988,5,B00073SK8E,"I read the book for the 2nd time just recently and found there was a movie made; thanks to Amazon.com (the best merchant in the world)!

If you like the book, you will like the movie. It captured everything I imagined when I read the book. I could not believe how they got it right. The people, the town.

This is not the book review, but if it were I would say I did not like the book's certain expicit decribed situations, totally not needed. I do not know what the author was thinking! He did need to add them to an otherwise great story. But, thankfully, those worthless scenes were omitted and not needed to make this a good film and better then the book for doing so.

A totally wonderful adaption to a unique book.  Plain Song, very plain, and simple, like a simple and sweet song. So well done and true to the story. I loved it and recommend it to all small town life story lovers. Real people connecting and touching; a sweet and uplifting movie!",1312156800,6,955,4.288888888888889
8044595,4,B00073SK8E,"This movie, to me is a window into a span of days in the lives of several people. The characters are presented without background. Many scenes just go from one person to the next. There is no resolution of the wife's issues. The Bully's story is not finished. However this story of a Father, who is also a Teacher who is trying to take care of two sons after his wife leaves him, seems realistic in scope. There is also a pregnant teen, 2 women who have their eyes on the Dad. Two older brothers who live on a farm. Then there is an older woman who supposedly passes away in her chair while still breathing. From the comments, this was a movie made from a book. I never read it. The movie has people that are just plain mean to children. That makes me mad. Then the older men are so sweet to the children and the female teacher helps everyone. How kind. The baby is sweet to look at. Like I said, this is a snapshot of people in a community interacting with each other. Not sure what to take from it. I can fill in the gaps with my own imagination. Not a bad movie. I always enjoy Aiden Quinn. Enjoy!!",1520380800,,1101,4.149532710280374

8044599,5,B00073SK8E,"Gentle, engaging treatment of Kent Haruf's novel.  (But do read the book first.)",1474329600,,80,5.153846153846154
8044600,3,B00073SK8E,"This is a very sweet, low-key movie. The PG rating makes it easy to use in a classroom; however, you also lose the edginess of the novel and DCPA play script versions. They also combined several plot threads in the interests of dramatic climaxes and cinematography, but this also made it less beleivable. The acting was good, the script well written. It's obviously not set on the northeast plains.
The filmmakers opted for a more dramatic, mountain-filled skyline, rather than a realistic one.
Worthwhile if you just want to reinforce the novel or play for understanding.",1464652800,,572,4.96875
