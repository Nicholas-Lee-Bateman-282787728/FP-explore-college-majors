Anyone interested in the paranormal or just a fan of Hollywood, this is a MUST see!!",1065398400,10,166,4.387096774193548
1882861,5,B00009EIPN,"I found this documentary, Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites to have exceeded all my expecations on the subject. The stories
told here are not new, just interesting. Just seeing all these
old Hollywood studios and movie star haunts was worth the cost
of the DVD itself. The longest section of this documentary is
the gravesites segment. This DVD clocks in at about 61 minutes.
Very well done and excellent production values.
Every self respecting star grave hunter should own this DVD.",1061164800,23,482,5.0375
7990667,1,B00009EIPN,This is just a bunch of people telling ghost stories. Very boring!  I've seen a lot better videos that show actual footage of paranormal activity! Don't buy this unless you like talking.,1509062400,,186,4.8125
7990668,5,B00009EIPN,"When I think of ""Old Hollywood"" or at least the imagery that comes with that saying, I think of Rudolph Valentino, Barbara LaMarr, Jean Harlow, Clara Bow, Mary Pickford and several others. This program takes a look at the older celebrities that pretty much started Hollywood, lived and died there.
 Several Hotels that are rumored to be haunted, The Roosevelt Hotel, The Knickerbocker Hotel are shown. Studios like the Raleigh Studios are known to be haunted by a few figures, one being a stageman that fell. Paramount that sits right next to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery is also covered. Several Graveyards in and around ""Hollywood"" are covered as well, ""Forever"" being one of them in which hundreds of deceased celebrities are buried from the ""Golden Age"" of early Hollywood. Forest Lawn of Glendale is also talked about where hundreds more are resting in the afterlife.
""The Grey Ghost"" aka The Queen Mary ship is said to have a few spirits aboard her vessel and is discussed.
The ""Jean Harlow/Paul Bern"" house is talked about as it saw an apparent suicide by Paul Bern when he was married to Jean Harlow. Sharon Tate was known to have lived there and maybe saw her own vision of impending death. Elke Somers home is also discussed as it may have several spirits living there.
All in all, a good overview of some of the stories that have lingered in Hollywood ""Lore"" when it comes to hauntings and the cemeteries here.
There are a few minor mistakes though such as dates being inaccurate or graves shown that are not the person talked about. Whoever chose the music for this also could have selected some better background sound. My thoughts.
Running time about 1 Hour,
Marc Wannamaker, A Hollywood Historian, talks about several areas of known interest.",1436659200,,1759,4.824503311258278

7990670,5,B00009EIPN,Very interesting movie telling about ghosts of hollywood.,1402099200,,57,6.25
7990671,5,B00009EIPN,I really enjoyed this DVD. I like ghost stories and watching this DVD was great! I hope to one day go to Hollywood and see this stuff myself but for now this will do,1341187200,,165,3.8823529411764706
7990672,3,B00009EIPN,This talks about the ghosts of Hollywood and Marilyn Monroe! Sounds like a lot of fun!,1212624000,,86,4.4375
7990673,1,B00009EIPN,"I finished watching this last night.  What scared me most was that I paid money for this. (I bought it from another vendor.)  I will be donating this and two others like it (California ghosts and Haunted England) to the library I work for.

The production was amateur.  It's like they made it up as they went along.  Even documentaries have to follow some sort of outline.  One bad point was that the narration started 10 to 15 minutes into the film.  And it was bad narration.  The tour guide they had did a better job of telling the story of Hollywood's haunted places.

Fred Calvert is listed as the producer, writer, director, and narrator.  This screams low budget, which it was.

Avoid this one.",1193529600,,701,4.528
7990674,1,B00009EIPN,I gave this movie one star because i didn't like it. It did not have a lot of hauntings and it only talked about dead cleberties. and where you can see there grave site. it was a disappointment.,1168387200,2,194,4.131578947368421
7990675,3,B00009EIPN,"Unlike so many others, this is not about researchers trying to contact the spirit world.  It is a documentary presentation of various stories and sites of hauntings and then you get tours of the gravesites of the stars (of course, Valentino is included).  I did enjoy the DVD but did not feel compelled to watch it over and over.  I would recommend it to those interested in this type of documentary.",1129766400,6,400,4.605633802816901
7990676,3,B00009EIPN,"I love the DVD and found the Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites very interesting, however, i think it truly left out a lot of other ghost folklore from CA. Also, I found the DVD lacking in ghosts. It had more gravesites than ghosts in my veiw. However, i liked the DVD but, i think it should had more ghosts in the movie.",1090368000,10,318,4.229508196721311
