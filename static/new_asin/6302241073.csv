444970,1,6302241073,"In the 70's, people will write, we took the first step in forgetting about ""them"" and thinking only of ""me."" The seed was sown by the sex, drugs and rock 'n roll generation that begat the ""Me"" generation. And part and parcel of that was the ""into's"" like 'I'm into  EST,' 'I'm into vegetables,' 'I have an eating disorder' and 12 step programs for people who had too much sex. And the Bert Convy role (Friedrich Bismark) is truly hilarious if you don't mind laughing at yourself. He is the latest czar in programs to be into. And he spoofs us and probably him better than anyone I ever saw. The rest of the movie is just horrible. Too strong a word? How about abysmal, tasteless and stupid.

First of all, what kind of Dorian Gray choice did Burt Reynolds make, having done Academy Award work in ""Deliverance"" six years earlier to embark on a career of flatulent humoresqe (I hesitate to use the word) comedies? What garbage.

Jill Clayburgh as the girlfriend (very nice word) of the 2 studs, Reynolds and Kristoferson. Boy that's believable. Can't say . . . anything about her. Reynolds. Come on Burt. Just say you did it for the money along with the other 88 ""comedies.""

Oh. I'm sorry. The movie. It's about football loosely based on the Dallas Cowboys and Kristofferson seems to have won (wow, this is tough to say) the heart of Ms. Clayburgh after both he and Reynolds have, errrr, known her extensively. Now Reynolds realizes that he might just love her and she's about to walk down the aisle with Kristofferson  . . . that's it.

444972,3,6302241073,"NORTH DALLAS 40
BY PETER GENT (1973)
 FILM STARRING NICK NOLTE AND MAC DAVIS (1978)
SEMI-TOUGH
BY DAN JENKINS
FILM STARRING BURT REYNOLDS, KRIS KRISTOFERSON AND JILL CLAYBURGH (1975)
Some great sports books are terrible films, such as Dan Jenkins' riotous Semi-Tough, which was a clunker 1975 film starring Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristoferson and the abysmal Jill Clayburgh.  Then there are great sports books that make pretty good films, as is the case with Peter Gent's North Dallas 40.  The 1978 film, starring Nick Nolte, was about as good as sports movies got in that era.  Subsequent efforts have raised the bar, but despite some hokiness, good acting and story development hold it up.
North Dallas 40 followed the same pattern as Semi-Tough, depicting in semi-fictional manner the intertwining of football, manhood and Texas.  These are probably the two best football novels ever written; both are raw,  funny and sexy.  North Dallas 40 takes the story one step further, by introducing tragedy and pathos.  Today, every Tom, Dick and Harry loves to pretend they know The Bard, and would say this book was Shakespearean.  I would not go that far, but it is good!  Finally, North Dallas 40 is the third of the great ""tell-all"" sports books of the 1970s.  Before North and Semi, there was Jim Bouton's Ball Four.
North Dallas 40 unsuccessfully tries to pass off an opening disclaimer that the characters are fictional.  Forget about it.  Phil Elliott is Peter Gent, a Dallas Cowboy's wide receiver in the 1960s.  B.A. is Tom Landy, the Cowboys legendary coach.  Seth Maxwell is Don Meredith, their quarterback from 1960 to 1968 (some tried to say he was Craig Morton, but he is ""Dandy Don"").  Thomas Richardson is Duane Thomas, the surly black militant Dallas running back and star of the 1972 Super Bowl.  Conrad Hunter is straight-arrow owner Clint Murchison, Art Hartman is Roger Staubach, and Jo Bob Williams is probably Bob Lilly.
It is a simple enough tale of a week in Elliott's life, preparing with his team for a pivotal game against Fran Tarkenton's New York Giants at Yankee Stadium (circa 1969).  Elliott is a rebel, a malcontent, a non-conformist, a drug addict, an alcoholic, a bi-curious womanizer, an atheist, maybe a Communist, and a clutch wide receiver.  He is appealing in that ""bad boy"" way that we love dark characters, like Paul Newman in ""Hud"".  He is having an affair with the fiance of the owner's younger brother, all the while soothing his terrible aches and bodily pains with a variety of pills, booze and pot.  His pot-smoking partner is Maxwell.
B.A. is a straight-arrow Christian who cannot understand why everybody cannot be like that.  He also has no personal feelings for his players, all of whom he motivates by mixing an even dose of  fear, loathing, intimidation and pain.  Much of Landry's ""plastic computer coach"" reputation stemmed from this book.  Maxwell is not anybody's friend, but rather a totally self-centered genius leader on a football field.  Elliott gets hooked up with the lovely Charlotte Caulder, and after the loss to the Giants, he is ex-communicated from the club for smoking pot.  Maxwell's pot smoking is conveniently overlooked.  Elliott's real crime is sleeping with the fiance of Conrad's brother.
In the book, when he returns to Charlotte, he finds that she and her black lover have been killed in a grisly love triangle murder.  The film, featuring the brooding Nolte at his anti-social best, and an excellent ""good ol' boy"" performance from Davis, steers from this hole and leaves us with the memory of Phil as victim of corporate hypocrisy.
Semi-Tough is much lighter, filled with sex, semi-macho Texas homilies, and Jenkins at his pure funniest.  It is the story of three childhood friends.  Billy Clyde Puckett (Reynolds) and Shake Tiller (Kristoferson) are superstar football players with the New York Giants who played together in high school in Ft. Worth, Texas, then at T.C.U..  Barbara Jane Bookman has been with them every step of the way since kindergarten.  The film is destroyed by Clayburgh's portrayal.  In the book, she is described as Pamela Anderson fine.  In 1975 Loni Anderson might have cut the mustard.  Okay, her character had depth, so they needed an actress, but Clayburgh was semi-pretty at the very best.  The idea that men would fall for her in the manner required is ludicrous.
The book succeeds because it can meander in and out of Billy Clyde's fervent imagination, making full use of his storytelling skills.  Billy Clyde describes writing Semi-Tough while Jenkins writes Semi-Tough, all during the week leading up to the Giants Super Bowl match-up with the Jets at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Films, which require a tight, three-act structure, fail when they meander, as this one does.  All the sight gags that Jenkins has the reader rolling in the aisles over are duds on the screen.  Nevertheless, three out of four ain't bad.",1077494400,3,4925,4.951278928136419

445016,3,6302241073,"Call SEMI-TOUGH (1977) less a gridiron film than a love triangle with a self-help seminar subplot. Ballplayers Burt Reynolds and Kris Krostofferson roommate with and share the platonic affections of team owner Robert Preston's daughter, Jill Clayburgh until she begins to fall for one of them, which creates a rift between the men.

While not listening to Gene Autry records, Big Ed (Preston) experiments with every psychic fad that comes along: pyramids, ""pelfing"" and more. Bert Convy figures large as the ""est""-like guru who instills confidence in the man that then wins Clayburgh's heart.

This movie was widely panned for deviating from the Dan Jenkins novel by concentrating on New Age stuff rather than football, thus an outstanding supporting cast is squandered here.

445022,4,6302241073,"I have to respectfully disagree with many of the other commentators and ""reviewers"" on this particular film. In truth Semi-Tough is a daring, imaginative, and intelligent reinvention of classic Hollywood comedies of remarriage, (Ritchie's model was The Philadelphia Story) from the point of view of Ritchie, who was influenced by the observational, loose camera styling of documentary work as much as he was influenced by the sort of sharp, merciless social satire of American foibles and set not in a drawing room but in the world of pro-football.

All three leads are perfect. Each works well off the other two, and one of the astonishing things about Semi-Tough is how it manages to dip into the lowest of farcical and sexual humor and yet retain the dignity and verbal sophistication of the writing from the thirties and forties. Convy is perfect ( and perfectly sleazy) as a Werner Erhard imitator and it is the greatest fun to see a movie so willing to criticize and lampoon so many cherished movements and fads that would come to dominate our lives in this country even more so in the three decades that followed this movie. The movie is relaxed about sexual matters. It concerns mature, adult themes and manages to tonally shift throughout from burlesque to genuine intimacy between its characters. It both respects and criticizes the world of sports and actually gives informed perspectives about how awful all of the earnestness of some of these spiritual movements can be for those that get caught up in them. Burt Reynolds is the sane center of the film: his common sensical rejection of a culture that takes itself too seriously and his playboy libertine ways are a great foil for the dilemma of Jill Clayburgh's falling in love with Kris Kristofferson. Semi-Tough has wonderful moments and comic vignettes that, though they contribute to the movement of story, reflect a different attitude towards storytelling in the 1970s and exist for their own sake, respecting the art that actors engage in. Even Brian Dennehy is interesting as a neanderthal, stereotypical jock; though he is brutish you never lose a sense of the humanity present. Robert Preston and Lotta Lenya only add to the fun.

Is it dated and terribly 70s? Yes and that is a virtue here because it is also a sociological document, a time capsule, in keeping with Michael Ritchie's background in documentary. You never know what will happen next in a film like this. Even the ending seems to run off the rails, becoming a different kind of movie completely, which shows daring on the part of the makers since they had no qualms about shifting a movie from one emotional center to another for stylistic effect.

Semi-Tough is from a time when filmmakers were genuine artists and took chances, even in the confines of a big budget studio movie. For that and all other reasons listed above I recommend it without any reservations.",1290902400,13,2903,4.896341463414634

445064,3,6302241073,"This is an OK film that attempts to skewer both professional sports and new age encounter training and falls short on both counts.  To be truly great satire you have to lacerate your intended targets not merely tweak them.  It seems the makers of the film were so afraid to offend their intended targets that they took a cowardly approach to their subject matter.  Shockingly, the film was directed by Michael Ritchie whose previously satirized brilliantly beauty pageants and organized children's sports in ""Smile"" and ""The Bad News Bears"" respectively.  Ring Lardner Jr., who wrote the script for ""M*A*S*H"", had his name taken off the credits.

If you or a loved one or friend is getting sucked up into the latest self-help guru or movement like the Law of Attraction or Wayne Dyer this is a must see.  Semi-Tough parodied Est and many of these things.  If you ever considered paying for your ""special"" mantra this is for you.  It is an incredibly funny parody of these movements and gurus.  My favorite scene is when Burt Reynolds attends the seminar to ""pull its pants down"".  You are supposed to be in the seminar room and not leave to go to the bathroom.  It's the classic cult brainwashing technique of humiliation.

445067,4,6302241073,"""Semi-Tough"" is not a movie for everyone. For those who love sports, sick humor and love the politically incorrect, this is definitely your movie. Dan Jenkins (suthor) makes great fun of pro football and the preliminaries leading to the Super Bowl. While the movie is about a Texas team (the Dallas Cowboys?), the foibles are applicable to most pro teams. Sex, boozing, and offbeat behavioral science are the ingredients, Jill Clayburgh, Robert Preston,Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristopherson are the players and they are downright fun, if a tad unbelievable at times (remember, this is a spoof).

445068,5,6302241073,"First off, the movie is different from the Dan Jenkins novel.  It is far more textured and layered.  The send-up of Est training is hilarious.  This is not so much a movie about football as it is a love story with a strong subtext satirizing self-help movements (including Pyramid Power).  The dialogue is memorable and Preston's performance would have garnered an academy award if the movie had been perceived as serious and weighty.  It IS serious and weighty, but it is done with a light, humorous touch.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times and never tire of it.  The reason: the performances, of course, but the one-liners are priceless.  This is the best introduction to the pantheon of Jenkins characters populating his Ft. Worth-centered novels, with a young Brian Dennehy doing a star turn as T. J. Lambert.  If you don't know the novels, you've got a great set of treats ahead of you.

445071,4,6302241073,"Semi-Tough is one of the few football movies I never got around to seeing until the other day and I am sorry I waited. It is a humorous, energetic send-up of football, celebrities, and post-sixties New Age mumbo-jumbo. As for what another reviewer said about Jill Clayburgh, I have to agree, she's completely miscast here, but that's my only acting criticism. I think Reynolds is outstanding in this role and really stands out. He is compelling and believable as Billy Clyde Puckett and his presence basically carries the film. What I found most unique and valuable here, however, was the satire involving Friedrich Bismark and BEAT--which was a paper-thin roast of Werner Erhard and EST. It is rather courageous that this movie decided to tangle with those parasites in the way they did, but it remains a rare example of Hollywood using its special position in society to advance the public good. There are other inventive parodies here as well such as the owner's devotion to ""moveogenics,"" and Reynolds having to get ""pelted"" by a quack doctor.

They are all great buddies and hopelessly irresponsible party animals of varying degrees. Things seem to be fine until Kristofferson and Clayburgh decide to get married. At that point, Reynolds realizes that he has had a lifelong crush on her and schemes how to get her without loosing his friends in the process.

He is aided by Kristofferson being the disciple of a New Age guru type who makes million trying to get ""IT"". The problem most people seem to have with getting it is that ""IT"" is undefined and doesn't mean anything. Kristofferson wants his fianc to get ""IT"" but she doesn't get it. Reynolds pretends he does but really knows it is all a crock. He uses his knowledge of their personalities to maneuver things the way he wants.

Seems the three have been friends all their lives, but now romance has erupted between B.J. and Shake. Will they make it to the altar, or will B.J. realize she should be with Billy Clyde instead?
