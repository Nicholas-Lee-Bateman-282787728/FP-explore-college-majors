6259842,4,B00IDPZYR8,"Recently, I saw photographs of two women in their 50's to 60's. Their faces looked youthful and firm, without that obvious (and often unattractive) look of having had plastic surgery. I was interested to find out what they both had in common was practicing yoga for the face (as well as the body). So to Amazon I went, to find an instructional DVD.

The instructor has a warm, positive attitude. There is a primer at the beginning showing you most of the exercises. Then there is a 7 day program. Each day's exercises take only minutes. Some of the exercises will take a little practice to isolate the correct muscles. And, it is sometimes difficult to see exactly what the instructor is doing (i.e, is she pushing her tongue out, or curling, more, etc.). With a couple of exercises there are titles on the screen giving instruction. Since it is difficult for her to give tips while she is performing the exercises, and with some you turn away, look up, etc., more the of the exercises should have on screen tips.

After only doing this program a few times, I could see my face lifting and tightening. I have been doing yoga for years, I'm only sorry that I wasn't practicing yoga for the face too.",1406937600,10,1198,4.541666666666667
6259843,4,B00IDPZYR8,"Very self explanatory, picture speaks a thousand words and easy to follow along with.  You must first isolate certain muscles to get it right so therefore doing a few at a time is best.",1398643200,8,185,4.4411764705882355
6259844,5,B00IDPZYR8,"Finally!  I have her book but the DVD brings Yoga Face to life!  The face exercise routine is a great way to beautify naturally instead of wasting money on expensive creams or treatments.  I found it easy and simple to follow and starting using it daily.  Plus, it's fun, and rejuvenating!",1393459200,5,289,4.607843137254902
6259845,5,B00IDPZYR8,"I loved her book but this DVD is soooo much better! I love that she shows you basic techniques in the first chapter then ""7-day Face Lift"" in the second chapter. I haven't completed the 7-day program just yet, but I already feel the difference after 2 days! This DVD is so easy to follow, and anyone can do it, anywhere, anytime. I wish I had this 5 years ago! Thank you!!",1393459200,11,372,4.180555555555555
6259846,5,B00IDPZYR8,Forget Botox. If you want an all natural way to remain looking and feeling young watch this DVD. I have the book and have given it to my friends as gifts.

8641305,5,B00IDPZYR8,"I love the book and the dvd.  The learning curve, like any form of exercise, is discovering and isolating your facial muscles. Once you get it you will  be more than satisfied. Annelise knowns what she is doing. You can see it in her face.",1478995200,,239,4.288888888888889

8641310,1,B00IDPZYR8,"I've been practicing yoga for 14 years, so I've had alot of yoga teachers and I have done alot of yoga.

First off, the dvd packaging refers to Annelise Hagen as a 'renowned yoga instructor.'  She was teaching and may still teach at NY Health and Racket Club.  No 'renowned' yoga teachers teach at gyms, they have their own studios.

Secondly, she said in some videos online that she made up alot of the exercises herself.  Well, maybe, but yoga for the face and is not a concept she thought up.  Its been done for centuries in India.  Some of the exercises in the video are not her original invention, so there is some dishonesty in her statements.

Thirdly, there is no audio instruction in the video!  The video consists of of her doing the exercises and that is it.  A few exercises have a line of instruction printed on the bottom, but no more.  In the video she doesn't tell you which muscles to relax and which muscles to tense.  NOTHING!  That is shocking to me as actual yoga is all about the specifics of the instruction and breathing.

I did a jaw exercise she made up, and my jaw aches.  which to me indicates that she has no clue.  I sent this back for a refund.

I recommend FACIAL FITNESS by Patricia Goroway.  I bought it on amazon and its fantastic.  Goroway really knows what she is doing.  You get a book and a dvd.  Goroway worked with a craniofacial expert in developing her exercise program and its far far superior to this dvd.",1439078400,10,1450,4.37593984962406
