2043417,5,B0001Z36PA,"I was very happy to see that this video is back to the Wiggles quality I had hoped for. A few of their releases were very disappointing, especially Cold spaghetti Western which even my 19 month old son won't watch, and he'll watch anything Wiggles. But this one is lots of fun, and colorful, and the music is good. It's not the same old songs they repeat in many of their other videos, and these songs are just as catchy as the earlier ""classics"". As far as having repeated material on their TV show that another reviewer mentioned, that's the whole success of the Wiggles branding. They repeat all their stuff in different formats and can keep selling it repackaged. I can't fault them for that. I personally have not seen these segments on their TV show, but we only watch on weekends. Overall, if you're looking for a new Wiggles video, and don't want to be disappointed, this is a good option. Both my son, and myself, enjoyed it.",1092614400,2,934,4.5
2043418,1,B0001Z36PA,"This is the lights camara action from the TV show,it looks like it was done in a hurry using old stuff from the TV show,just to get a DVD?VHS out. We love the wiggles,we have all of the dvd's I wish we had not bought this one. The music is bad bad bad.",1092441600,4,252,3.7735849056603774
2043419,1,B0001Z36PA,"My husband and I are huge fans of the Wiggles; we enjoy their fun, wholesome songs and the good lessons they teach our children.  We even took our son to see the Wiggles live when they came to town, and we loved their show.

This video, however, was very disappointing.  The gremlins creep around doing nasty things to sabotage the Wiggles.  For some reason the Wiggles can't see them, despite the fact that they are life-sized people lurking around in ridiculously bright costumes.  But the worst part is that the music on this video is sooo lousy.  No catchy tunes.  No bright, sparkling lyrics.  None of the things we love about the Wiggles.

JMHO",1091664000,3,650,4.631578947368421
2043420,4,B0001Z36PA,"Now that we've grown accustomed to having The Wiggles at home on a daily basis, we really look forward to each new DVD, to give the others a well deserved break. Sometimes they hit, sometimes they miss, but they are never-the-less always welcome.

This one is a hit, especially with my three year old, who has watched it repeatedly since it arrived.  It is indeed a vast improvement over Cold Spaghetti which was overcooked, overdone and not appetizing.

The concept is funny, with two mischievous gremlins wrecking havoc on The Wiggles and friends.  The gremlins may be a bit annoying to adults, but are definitely a hit with kids, the intended audience.  Captain Feathersword has a lot more quality screen time in this one, and Anthony isn't as hammy.  Greg, however, should never be required to do any dance steps that involve moving his hips, which have absolutely no ball bearings.

The choreography again is not the best, but is improving.  Those ever-present red marching band uniforms are back again, but this time they more or less fit in to the theme.  Even The Wiggles donned them this time, so somebody obviously likes them.

The songs are the best they have done for a while, with quite a few sing-worthy tunes. The songs are:

Camera One

Gulp Gulp

Testing One, Two, Three

Bit By Bit (We're Building A Set)

Vegetable Soup

Hats

Music With Murray

Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles!

Dressing Up

Where's Jeff?

Anthony's Workshop

Overall, one of the better Wiggles productions.

2043421,3,B0001Z36PA,"This video features a lot of the songs and segments that are now shown on the Wiggles Playhouse Disney show. Those songs don't appear on any other video they have out, so they are at least new. It would have been nice to see something new. I kind of expected more than what I could get off of T.V.. Usually their videos have more new songs and such. You could tape their ""new"" (actually filmed 2 years ago)show for a week and you'd find most, if not all, of these songs. My 2 year old daughter loved the video though. However, she would watch anything they do, because they are such great entertainers for kids. I just expected something new out of this ""new"" video!",1091145600,,666,4.336
2043422,4,B0001Z36PA,"Younger kids (less than two years old) will probably not enjoy this movie as much as other Wiggles movies.  Some of the Wiggles earlier DVD's were really just a collection of 60-90 second songs which appealed to the limited concentration spans of kids from 9 to 18 months.
This feature is different - it has a story line and is littered with songs along the way.  The songs are typical Wiggles - catchy and kids love them.
If you have younger kids, go for Yummy Yummy or Toot Toot.  If your children are older and like Wiggle Bay and Space Dancing then they will love this.
It is very difficult for parents to objective critics of the Wiggles - but this is one of the better features - better than Wiggle Bay and has more songs than Space Dancing.
The features on this DVD (Region 4 version anyway) are quite good.  It has the obligatory photo slideshow with music, and it also has a half an hour TV episode of the Wiggles TV show, which is a good bonus.
Enjoy, and keep on Wiggling!",1089676800,3,983,4.326086956521739
2043433,4,B0001Z36PA,Wiggles fans....this is an great DVD for getting your little ones hopping and beebopping.  Great songs that are (parents beware) quite catchy. ;),1387238400,,145,5.304347826086956
2043434,3,B0001Z36PA,"If you have other Wiggles DVDs with episodes of Lights Camera Action then a lot of this will look familiar. I think Bit by Bit, Little By Little might be another Cockroaches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-The-Cockroaches/dp/B006M6W6QC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of The Cockroaches</a>&nbsp;song that's been Wigglfied. Caveland from this era definitely is.

Simon Pryce, Ringo the Ringmaster and the red Wiggle as of 2013, is one of the Gremlins and exhibits the playful charm needed for a Wiggle. The other is one of the dancers who's name escapes me but he has a big smile and lots of curly blond hair so you can't miss him. Alas they don't use the gremlins as much as they could, as most of the bits were intended to be chopped up for later use in the LCA series, but the idea is there. The gremlins make innocent mischief, no one gets hurt, and kids learn a bit how a TV studio works. Alert ears can listen for Sam Moran's operatic voice but he doesn't appear.

Look for the extra songs in the Jukebox menu, the one about the flowers is one of their better songs and sounds like a grown up one they'd play on the radio.",1364256000,,1187,4.93

2043436,2,B0001Z36PA,"I took a chance on this one but it just isn't one my toddler likes.  The gremlin story sounded good on paper but just is kind of weird in the movie.  Also, it recycles a lot from the ""Lights, Camera, Action!"" DVD which is much better in my opinion.",1355875200,,248,4.040816326530612

2043438,4,B0001Z36PA,"Personally, I think this is one of the worst Wiggles I've seen. The songs are really stretching it & in my opinion horrible! BUT it's not supposed to be adult entertainment. That being said, my 18 month old son LOVES this one! He picks out his own movies that he wants to watch and this one has quickly become a favorite! Regardless of if adults think it's good, it is for the kids and his attention to it and smiles over it speaks for itself!",1323648000,,443,4.223529411764706
2043439,5,B0001Z36PA,"This is a fantastic dvd.  My 3 year granddaughter has to watch this show every day.  This one, space dancing, and toot toot the big red car are her absolute favorites.  Not only do we have a lot of the wiggles dvds, we also have most of their cds.  We especially like all the ones with Greg in them.",1274313600,2,299,4.016949152542373
2043440,1,B0001Z36PA,We have watched nearly all the Wiggles DVD's but my daughter aged 3 was terrified of the Gremlins and didn't understand the plot. She refused to watch it after one viewing. It's all rather convoluted and not much fun.,1267488000,,217,4.589743589743589
2043441,5,B0001Z36PA,My 2 y/o son gets bored with the new episodes of the Wiggles. The old shows with the first yellow wiggle are much more active and he loves them!,1261958400,,144,4.0
2043442,5,B0001Z36PA,"My son loves this DVD.  He is a wiggles fan.  for reasons beyond me, he loves this DVD.  I am not sure why.  I prefer the wiggles concert DVDs.  But this is one of his favorites.  I had to buy it twice because the first one wore out we played it so much.",1239235200,,254,3.69811320754717
2043443,3,B0001Z36PA,"I am a big fan of the Wiggles and I did enjoy some of the songs, like vegetable soup, but I was slightly dissapointed with this video overall.  It seemed like they were a little less polished, maybe finding what format worked best for them in this one. I guess I am slightly biased because I don't enjoy the Network Wiggles quite as much as some of their other scenarios. It had a lot of dialogue in it between songs, which did not attract my eighteen month old's attention quite as much as it normally does.  I also did not really care for the gremlins, but the first time my daughter saw one of them running in the opening sequence, she laughed and giggled. Worth buying but definitely not my favorite to watch over and over and over...",1233532800,,738,4.340579710144928
2043444,4,B0001Z36PA,"Wiggly Gremlins was the 5th Wiggles DVD that we acquired and at first I was very disappointed. It seemd to me that the performance lacked heart; the Wiggles were running out of ideas. However, I should have consulted with my 23-month-old daughter before passing judgement: this DVD immediately became her favorite! It took me quite by surprise, as we had just purchased Wiggly Wiggly World the day before (ruling out the novelty factor), which I think is extrememly well produced. After having watched the Gremlins with my daughter for the umpteenth time, I have to say that I have grown to like it quite a bit: the songs are catchy, the plot is cute and sufficiently simple for a toddler to follow, and the performance of the Wiggles is good. I suppose the only thing that still bothers me is that Captain Feathersword blamed Wags for a decision he made himself. I hope my daughter won't catch it or our dog may become the designated scapegoat in our house :-)",1168905600,,961,4.658823529411765
2043445,4,B0001Z36PA,"This is a very good selection of songs that are brought together by a little story concerning gremlins, who attempt to prevent the Wiggles from getting to the studio to put on their show. My son is twenty-eight months old now and has really enjoyed this DVD over the past eight months or so. Okay, I admit it! I like singing along with the songs as well. Absent a few notable exceptions, these are some of the best songs they have recorded. I cannot think of very many other children's acts that are genuinely entertaining for both parents and children; Sesame Street is one, albeit to a lesser degree than the Wiggles. The DVD also features an episode of ""Network Wiggles"" and a couple extra music videos, including ""Go To Sleep, Jeff"" (sung to Brahms' Lullaby). Playing this has worked like a charm to put my son to bed after he had spent the better part of an hour dancing to ""Woo Hoo! Wiggly Gremlins!"" I picked it up for $7.50, so I consider it a fantastic deal.",1156204800,,967,4.438202247191011
2043446,1,B0001Z36PA,"We love the Wiggles at our house, but do not love this one. I have never been a fan of their Network Wiggles phase and this is that to the extreme. My toddler never got into the video.",1135123200,,184,3.8684210526315788
2043447,5,B0001Z36PA,"This is a great DVD. Just because they made a TV series from this DVD doesn't mean it's a bad Wiggles collection of songs. In fact, this is one of my 3 childrens' favorite Wiggles DVDs and the fact that it inspired an entire season of their show on Disney Channel should tell people that the quality of the music. Some of the best tunes on the project includes the ever infectous:

Lights, Camera, Action!

Hats

Testing 1 2 3

Music Murray

Where's Jeff

Bit By Bit

 I read a lot of adults moaning and griping about this DVD, but the kids still love it despite the whiney big people's grumping; that's where the true success of this project should be measured... in the hearts of the children.",1115856000,,742,4.462686567164179
2043448,2,B0001Z36PA,"I love the Wiggles, but this dvd leaves much to be desired.  The storyline is practically nonexistent and the songs are definitely not the best.  I do wish I had chosen a different title, but my 17 month old has been glued to it, so I suppose it can't be all that bad.",1107043200,,268,4.037735849056604
2043449,5,B0001Z36PA,"I didn't know this was a repackaging of a lot of the songs from the 'Lights, Camera, Action' series on Disney & at first I was a bit cheesed off because of it.  But my 9 month old daughter absoultly LOVES this video. It's her favorite of all the Wiggles videos we own. I think it's because she has seen it so often on TV.

Older kids might be bored with it because it has a lot of the ame songs as the TV show but my infant loves it.",1100563200,,433,3.8
2043450,2,B0001Z36PA,"I was excited to watch a new Wiggles DVD with our 18 month old son. He loves his other video and the TV show. This one has a lot of talking and our son gets bored in between the songs. He's watched it a few times but prefers the other one - Top of the Tots.

I do like the two bonus videos - they are cute and our son dances to them.

Overall I would not reccommend this new DVD.",1098835200,,379,3.6666666666666665
2043451,5,B0001Z36PA,"Wiggly Gremlins is a new wiggly movie that's made up of Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles episodes, and like all the other DVDs of The Wiggles, this is also much better then (Magical Adventure).

Most of the songs are exactly the same- and one bonus song from ""Go To Sleep, Jeff"" gives me an idea of what that might look like when it comes to video & DVD.",1097712000,,353,4.268656716417911

If I had one complaint it would be that there is too much dialogue in between songs, but that's really not too big of a deal since you can skip forward if you need to.  Make sure you watch/listen to the Dancing Flowers song under the ""Extras"" section -- it's the best!",1092787200,,507,4.216494845360825

8018468,3,B0001Z36PA,"Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Whoo Hoo Wiggly shocks by its plausibility.

Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Simon and Greg as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Murray, too, has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Whoo Hoo Wiggly is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique. ..

The Wiggles - Whoo Hoo Wiggly, prepare to be disturbed!",1428969600,,1682,4.960992907801418
