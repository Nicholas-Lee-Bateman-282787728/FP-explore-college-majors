3089036,5,B0012GTPPM,i was made aware of this series via a podcast that i listened to. this is an intelligent science fiction series...you must pay attention to the shifting storylines and cast of characters. i have enjoyed viewing this series. i think it stands up overtime and have made other links and discoveries each time i watched. it's a good mystery.,1372896000,9,337,4.728813559322034
3089037,5,B0012GTPPM,This is a unique and interesting series that I had not heard of as an American.  The plot line is not completely unique but the way it was filmed and the whole feel of the series is very different from the run of the mill in the US.  Plus it take place in South Africa.  Americans need to learn about other places in the world.  Yes!  There are other places.,1289606400,12,358,4.057142857142857

I strongly suggest binge watching so that you can keep up with all that is going on.  Yes, they do 're-caps', and at times I felt they over did this, but I had the luxury of fast forwarding and binge watching.
Sadly, I don't think this show would do well in the USA.  Fellow Sci-fiers will love it, but the population in general would be lost on the concepts presented and the story line.
With that said, I think it is one of 2 best Sci-fi movies of this decade.  The other one being 'The Expanse' which has been a pleasant surprise.  Both shows are somewhat original and contain many twists and turns that leave you guessing.
I couldn't quite give Charlie Jade a 5 star rating because I felt some of the middle episodes added fluff to extend the season.  But the biggest knock on the show is the ending.  Were they planning on doing a 2nd season or were they leaving arguably the 2 main characters without an ending?

3089083,4,B0012GTPPM,"I really enjoyed this short series.  I'm a sci fi junky and it did not disappoint.  Its low budget & out there (meaning a bit weird) at times but nothing too detracting.  Its about parallel universes - some known, some to be discovered; the technology/corporation controlling them; and the never ending battle of those who strive to keep one from destroying the other.  There are old time & new friends, strangers, enemies, frenemies, lovers and many more.  I was worried, with so much going on the last two episodes, that it was going to leave alot of holes but didn't go down that way.  In my opinion (didn't fact check), it was written to be exactly as long as it is so you get a good amount of closure.",1494201600,2,706,4.434108527131783

3089085,2,B0012GTPPM,"I purchased season one because it looked like a great deal for all those episodes. The summary sounded really interesting as well. Parallel realities happening in the near future. And I read a whole lot of fantastic reviews.
This show is really bad, like...unwatchable bad. The acting is really bad, and the way they film it is like porn without out the sex. I hate to blame the actors, so Im just going to assume its the writing....just really bad dialogue.... Its too bad, because this had such a great storyline. Im irritated because I spent the money so I might as well watch it. Ive tried three different times, I managed to make it to the second episode before finally throwing in the towel. I feel bad they spent all this money on a production and it has such bad writing and cinematography.",1493078400,3,798,4.548611111111111

The opening scene is follow by a car scene that is supposed to be intriguing because... it's a muscle car... in atmospheric mist...wow. I made it to 3:45 and couldn't take it any more. But it's science fiction, so I'll give it an extra star.",1492473600,,388,5.274193548387097
3089087,4,B0012GTPPM,The series has some interesting plot twists. It starts out in a dystopian world which has the look and feel of the one from Blade Runner. Take a close look one of the minor protagonists SewSew Tukars and compare him to Edward James Olmos's character in Blade Runner they could almost be twins. The character development for Charlie Jade is fairly well done but there is not much exposition given to the rest of the cast's character's and that is my main complaint. Also although the ending gives you  some answers it leaves some big ones unanswered. Keep with it to the end as it is fairly enjoyable throughout. As to the ending  (don't worry no spoilers) my guess is there was planned to be at least another season but it must have been cancelled. A shame as it was holding my interest and was I think a more imaginative plot than most of the series broadcast now. As quite frankly I am getting burnt out of the Marvel universe.,1490140800,5,929,4.458823529411765
3089098,2,B0012GTPPM,I made it to the middle of episode 3......very slow and kinda just meanders with no solid reason,1489536000,,96,4.388888888888889

The acting is believable, the filming is a little out there, but it fits with the genre therefore it works. I enjoyed this series. I understand why there was only one season and they wrapped everything up quite nicely at the end. Obviously, like any other science fiction show you can't over think it and you must be willing to suspend reality. If you can do that, you'll enjoy it.",1488153600,4,485,4.651162790697675
3089101,5,B0012GTPPM,"This is not Stargate or Star Trek. There are no spaceships or time travel, but it is excellent scifi. This could be compared with the Expanse, just set closer to our time.
Follow the story closely, there are twists and turns throughout, and the series is tied up nicely at the end. It would have been nice to see a second season, but so many shows, like Battlestar Galactica, get their timeline dragged out to make more money, or like Star Gate Universe, they get cancelled before things wrap up. It is nice to have a well written series that does not end leaving you completely hanging.
One or two of the episodes could have been left out, they seemed to not fit in the entire story line, but other than that this is better than something to binge watch. This was a great series.",1487376000,12,780,4.386206896551724
3089102,5,B0012GTPPM,"I admit, after reading some reviews I wasn't sure about this program, so I watched the final episode FIRST.  I then watched it all in a marathon.  What everyone else found slow, confusing, or disconnected...wasn't.  I thoroughly enjoyed ALL the episodes...except when the ""father"" visits Gama.  The only part they didn't clear up in the final was the back story on the ""grey men"".  But, I figured it was a hanger for future episodes.  The benefit of watching the last episode first was I didn't have to watch it all again for the ""ah ha"" moments.  Enjoy!",1487030400,7,554,4.649484536082475
3089103,2,B0012GTPPM,"This should have been pulled and BURNED at least before episode 6.

-10 worst TV score of all time. Irritating, avant-garde music ruins what could be passable Sci-FI. I could have watched it otherwise. By episode 5 I could not stand it any more.
-5 Terrible video. Did they shoot this on a cell phone?
-3 Acting is from passable to terrible but I think the 'terrible' was due to direction.
-2 Script? This is not a script. It's pieces of one liners with words thrown around them ambling towards some storyline.
-1 Directing and editing is just not.  I cannot believe that Michael Filipowich & Patricia McKenzie are that bad - it has to be the direction and choppy editing. ...
...

A total *** waste of time.

I'd say I hate it (a ""1"") but I do not really 'hate' anything.  Amazon should really have a ZERO rating to mean ""Not even worth a review.""",1486944000,2,854,4.379746835443038

3089105,4,B0012GTPPM,"I discovered this series many years ago on cable late one night and was hooked.  Over the years I have wondered if there was ever a second season and if it would every come on TV again.  I have occasionally searched here and on Netflix from time to time but no luck.  What a surprise to find it here.

I found the show very interesting, despite having to really pay attention since the jumping back and forth between worlds can sometimes be confusing.  At least here I can replay scenes to clarify.

I think it is a really good low budget TV sci-fi offering for it's decade.  When it came along there was not nearly as much of it going around as there is today.",1483142400,,661,4.24
3089106,2,B0012GTPPM,"Simply put, it is badly acted and over dramatized.  Moves way too slowly.",1483056000,3,73,4.615384615384615
3089107,4,B0012GTPPM,"This is not for the faint of heart, reading other reviews should tell you that much.
I enjoyed, it was slow and hard to track at times, the final episode really made the weirdness make sense, like how fight clubs awakening in the end had. I don't consider my time wasted and would have liked to see what 2nd series could of done, but given most don't wrap things up, was nice to this one did.",1482019200,,392,4.171052631578948
3089118,2,B0012GTPPM,"The concept was interesting, and the writers weren't doing too badly with it. Almost without exception, the acting is extremely bad. The lead character is the worst. Rather than selecting an underwear model, the production team would have done better selecting a guy who looks the part of a jaded investigator and can actually act. HIs girlfriend also looks like an underwear model and has all the acting capability of a robot.  After two episodes (giving them a chance and all) I couldn't tolerate the poor acting to see if the writers got into their stride later in the series. The mom and kid the guy meets after landing in a desert were the only two actors who could act. Everyone else was embarrassingly dismal. The music, scenery, and filming is boringly cliche. This show is really pretty bad. The actors should consider a job in underwear modeling and the writers should consider working with a different team that can present their ideas more successfully.",1480896000,6,965,4.848484848484849

3089120,1,B0012GTPPM,"Another failed Sci Fi TV series, this time a collaboration of South African and Canadian interests. With a storyline based on the notion of parallel universes, the series seemed promising. But the very gloomy atmosphere, the unappealing settings and the mediocre acting chased me away. Before the completion of the third episode of Season 1 I was gone, with no desire toad my misery to that of the film's inhabitants.",1480118400,3,417,4.9714285714285715
3089121,2,B0012GTPPM,I've watched 3 episodes so far. I wanted to like it but it's just too boring.,1478822400,3,77,3.875
3089122,5,B0012GTPPM,"I came across this show by accident, and decided to see what it was. I was not disappointed. Indeed, I was surprised at how well it was done. The premise is simple. Multiple earths, with a corporation setting up machines at three earths so they can move resources and people around. The corporate complexes are destroyed, leaving only a few people who can travel between the worlds without the machines (because they've traveled so much they have certain particles that allow it, it seemed).

But the real story is about Charlie Jade who is a detective. The corps are powerful in all 3 worlds, but each world is different. Charles earth is 50 years ahead of the other two (including ours) in technology. A freak circumstance flings him and another woman character into our world. Now he has to find out how to get back to his own earth. Charlie's world in in dire straits with some ecological problems, so his world is more complex. People are grouped as C1, C2, or C3, and your life revolves around your classification. The corporations are the bad guys in the show, but there's no mention of how their government works, so you can't compare the two or separate them.

I thought the acting was good, the characters interesting, if not over the top at times. But that made the show unpredictable. You don't need expensive FX or explosions to make a good show, and this keeps you going. It's also filmed in a unique way, or maybe it's because the budget was low. (which to me, keeps the background from getting in the way of the acting).

This seems to have been made quite some time ago (I can't believe I've never heard of it), but easily stands up in today's world.

I was hooked on the first episode, and watched them all within a few days.",1477699200,,1743,4.523809523809524
3089123,1,B0012GTPPM,"At no point did this show pique my interest. To be fair, I even finish the first episode, so maybe it improves. I just have no desire to find out.",1477353600,2,146,3.9
3089124,5,B0012GTPPM,"Sci Fi for intelligent people. Does not spoon feed the plot to you. There are clues in every episode that are easy to miss unless you pay attention. This is deliberate on the director's and show runner's parts. Exercise is good for your brain and the work pays off, slowly but surely. A couple of the episodes haunted me, something I can say about very few shows.",1477267200,7,363,4.432835820895522
3089125,3,B0012GTPPM,I wanted to like this series but it was just too weird. You know like when you used to watch Sponge Bob on Nick. It was so ridiculous and never made sense but you kept on watching it anyways. I made it to the 10th episode and couldn't take it anymore. I also found the randomness of the story distracting. It also didn't help that they had to say G@# D!@# in almost every episode. I agree with the other postings that this could have been a really good storyline had the writers been better and the actors left a lot to be desired too.,1477180800,,535,4.104761904761904
3089126,2,B0012GTPPM,"Interesting concept.  Could have been a good show, however the cinematography was poor an the writing was sub-par.  The actors are a mixed bunch.  Some were good but most either over acted or didn't portray a feeling of reality.  The show kind of made me think about the old 70s scifi, where everything was kind of corny.",1477094400,3,321,4.578947368421052
3089127,5,B0012GTPPM,"I just finished the series, was worried that with only 1 season there would be many story lines left hanging, but they wrapped it up pretty clean. It is very interesting how the characters evolve, especially 01 Boxer. I ended up going back & re-watching episodes a couple times to help clear up questions, it is that engaging!",1476316800,6,326,4.637931034482759
3089148,3,B0012GTPPM,"Uneven. Meandering. Excessive use of flashbacks, including one episode that consists almost entirely of flashbacks. Does not get better as the season progresses, though excluding that flashback episode and the final episode, they're all roughly the same in terms of goodness. The only good thing to say about the final episode is that they ended the series.",1475884800,3,357,5.280701754385965
3089149,2,B0012GTPPM,"A good concept, but the writers weren't up to the task of implementing it. I can think of any number of first-rate science fiction and fantasy writers, past and present, who have produced  excellent treatments of the parallel universe theme.  Among other things, they didn't have to resort to voice-overs and flashbacks to keep things moving.",1475280000,7,342,5.089285714285714
3089150,5,B0012GTPPM,"I just watched the whole series.  It is defiantly a pensive sci-fi that at fist could look like just a whimsical piece,to some, but I could not be further from that.  I am a big sci-fi fan, and had never heard of this, but stopped following media and V for more than 10 year.

There are three uni-verse-'s..But are all parallel:  Alpha-verse which is like the future,..Beta-verse, which is suppose to be the present..early 2000-ish and Gamma-verse... the world like eden. Beautiful and untouched.  Charlie Jade comes from Alpa-verse but there is something very special about him, for he has visions of all three universes.  (there are more than three but only Carlie and this little girl can see them) .  Charlie can travel, so can the son of the big corporate empire from the future universe.

I don't want to give too much away but this is very well written and acted.  It does NOT have this crazy huge production budget so I think people that watch it can assume it is not well made as I did after a few episode... I then got hooked and realized it doesn't not need big budget to be great.  There are surprises, not like huge plot twist but a shift in how we see characters, and it is not typical... it does not sell out, so to speak, as other productions do.  It reminds me of Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" series..

The main actor is fantastic, and so are many of the other cast member.
It is not about time travel!  It is well acted unlike a few reviewers complaints.
It is something to rewatch twice... for they do not dumb it down and there are things to be missed.
I thought the ending was very well done too, unlike what they did to that show ""Lost""..and how the sold out.  This is not like that.  It leave you thinking.",1475107200,4,1724,4.377358490566038

3089153,4,B0012GTPPM,"Pretty good so far 3 episodes in. It took 3 episodes to really hook me, though, so give it a chance.

Detective, mystery, scifi action type series. The lead character is cool. Acting is average to good, sets are nice. It's well done, writing is realistic and material. I gave it four stars for plot development and for being interesting. After the 3rd epi, I'm hooked.

Plus, if you have Prime, it's free!

The interesting aspect isn't the parallel universes, although much more interesting than the impossibility of time travel. (Einstein never said you could ""time travel."" that was a Hollywood misconception. He said if you could get close enough to a black hole, time would move more slowly, and if you could come back, you would see a world ""in the future"" as time ""moves"" slower at higher gravity--which is proven. Five minutes in a near black hole would equal 50 years in out time.) Any scifi that relies on time travel is extremely boring to me. I mean, why not just go back a little further and undo the undo ad infinitum? Parallel Universes cannot be that easily dismissed.

Anyway, the sci-fi aspect of it is not the most interesting, although the technology is interesting vs other universes, which is a cool device, but what I find interesting is how all of the characters are a piece of the puzzle, and how they interact through the parallel universes in away that show different aspects of personalities for all of the same characters and the implication that we can make our world what we want, full of socipathic corporate goons that write sociopathic laws in a polluted and dying world, or as beautiful as a universe comprised of laws that benefit all people who live according to human compassion and love. It's not that original, but the way the story is told is artistic and clever, surreal, and mesmerizing due to the colors, ambient sounds, sets, and beautiful scenes from around the world. It's more like an abstract painting than a realism.

That is why I gave it four stars, and not a high 3 star rating. It's a thinking persons series. It's interesting and believable, and the acting and writing are realistic.",1473638400,17,2137,4.7032085561497325

3089155,2,B0012GTPPM,"It's a shame.  This could've been really good.  The main issues are the order in which the story is told and the voiceover.  There's a lot of shifting back and forth in time, and though there's a voiceover of the eponymous character, the point of view changes a lot.  There's a lot of head-hopping.  Even Reena gets to have a few seconds of voiceover in episode 2 (I think).  And the writing of the voiceover is worse than Deckard's in Blade Runner.  The concept of the voiceover is terrible.  I was kind of interested in what was happening, but it was put together so badly that I just couldn't take it anymore.",1473033600,6,612,4.401785714285714

Its about parallel universes - some known, some to be discovered; the technology/corporation controlling them; and the never ending battle of those who strive to keep one from destroying the other.  There are old time & new friends, strangers, enemies, frenemies, lovers and many more.  I was worried, with so much going on the last two episodes, that it was going to leave alot of holes but didn't go down that way.  In my opinion (didn't fact check), it was written to be exactly as long as it is so you get a good amount of closure.",1494201600,2,706,4.434108527131783

This show is really bad, like...unwatchable bad. The acting is really bad, and the way they film it is like porn without out the sex. I hate to blame the actors, so Im just going to assume its the writing....just really bad dialogue.... Its too bad, because this had such a great storyline. Im irritated because I spent the money so I might as well watch it. Ive tried three different times, I managed to make it to the second episode before finally throwing in the towel.

3323584,4,B0012GTPPM,The series has some interesting plot twists. It starts out in a dystopian world which has the look and feel of the one from Blade Runner. Take a close look one of the minor protagonists SewSew Tukars and compare him to Edward James Olmos's character in Blade Runner they could almost be twins. The character development for Charlie Jade is fairly well done but there is not much exposition given to the rest of the cast's character's and that is my main complaint. Also although the ending gives you  some answers it leaves some big ones unanswered. Keep with it to the end as it is fairly enjoyable throughout. As to the ending  (don't worry no spoilers) my guess is there was planned to be at least another season but it must have been cancelled. A shame as it was holding my interest and was I think a more imaginative plot than most of the series broadcast now. As quite frankly I am getting burnt out of the Marvel universe.,1490140800,5,929,4.458823529411765

Follow the story closely, there are twists and turns throughout, and the series is tied up nicely at the end. It would have been nice to see a second season, but so many shows, like Battlestar Galactica, get their timeline dragged out to make more money, or like Star Gate Universe, they get cancelled before things wrap up. It is nice to have a well written series that does not end leaving you completely hanging.

The only part they didn't clear up in the final was the back story on the ""grey men"".  But, I figured it was a hanger for future episodes.

-5 Terrible video. Did they shoot this on a cell phone?
-3 Acting is from passable to terrible but I think the 'terrible' was due to direction.
-2 Script? This is not a script. It's pieces of one liners with words thrown around them ambling towards some storyline.

Over the years I have wondered if there was ever a second season and if it would every come on TV again.  I have occasionally searched here and on Netflix from time to time but no luck.  What a surprise to find it here.

I found the show very interesting, despite having to really pay attention since the jumping back and forth between worlds can sometimes be confusing.  At least here I can replay scenes to clarify.

Rather than selecting an underwear model, the production team would have done better selecting a guy who looks the part of a jaded investigator and can actually act. HIs girlfriend also looks like an underwear model and has all the acting capability of a robot.  After two episodes (giving them a chance and all) I couldn't tolerate the poor acting to see if the writers got into their stride later in the series. The mom and kid the guy meets after landing in a desert were the only two actors who could act. Everyone else was embarrassingly dismal. The music, scenery, and filming is boringly cliche. This show is really pretty bad.

3323619,5,B0012GTPPM,"I came across this show by accident, and decided to see what it was. I was not disappointed. Indeed, I was surprised at how well it was done. The premise is simple. Multiple earths, with a corporation setting up machines at three earths so they can move resources and people around. The corporate complexes are destroyed, leaving only a few people who can travel between the worlds without the machines (because they've traveled so much they have certain particles that allow it, it seemed).

But the real story is about Charlie Jade who is a detective. The corps are powerful in all 3 worlds, but each world is different. Charles earth is 50 years ahead of the other two (including ours) in technology. A freak circumstance flings him and another woman character into our world. Now he has to find out how to get back to his own earth. Charlie's world in in dire straits with some ecological problems, so his world is more complex. People are grouped as C1, C2, or C3, and your life revolves around your classification. The corporations are the bad guys in the show, but there's no mention of how their government works, so you can't compare the two or separate them.

I thought the acting was good, the characters interesting, if not over the top at times. But that made the show unpredictable. You don't need expensive FX or explosions to make a good show, and this keeps you going. It's also filmed in a unique way, or maybe it's because the budget was low. (which to me, keeps the background from getting in the way of the acting).

This seems to have been made quite some time ago (I can't believe I've never heard of it), but easily stands up in today's world.

I was hooked on the first episode, and watched them all within a few days.",1477699200,,1743,4.523809523809524

It was so ridiculous and never made sense but you kept on watching it anyways. I made it to the 10th episode and couldn't take it anymore. I also found the randomness of the story distracting.

3323647,5,B0012GTPPM,"I just watched the whole series.  It is defiantly a pensive sci-fi that at fist could look like just a whimsical piece,to some, but I could not be further from that.  I am a big sci-fi fan, and had never heard of this, but stopped following media and V for more than 10 year.

There are three uni-verse-'s..But are all parallel:  Alpha-verse which is like the future,..Beta-verse, which is suppose to be the present..early 2000-ish and Gamma-verse... the world like eden. Beautiful and untouched.  Charlie Jade comes from Alpa-verse but there is something very special about him, for he has visions of all three universes.  (there are more than three but only Carlie and this little girl can see them) .  Charlie can travel, so can the son of the big corporate empire from the future universe.

I don't want to give too much away but this is very well written and acted.  It does NOT have this crazy huge production budget so I think people that watch it can assume it is not well made as I did after a few episode... I then got hooked and realized it doesn't not need big budget to be great.  There are surprises, not like huge plot twist but a shift in how we see characters, and it is not typical... it does not sell out, so to speak, as other productions do.  It reminds me of Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"" series..

The main actor is fantastic, and so are many of the other cast member.
It is not about time travel!  It is well acted unlike a few reviewers complaints.
It is something to rewatch twice... for they do not dumb it down and there are things to be missed.
I thought the ending was very well done too, unlike what they did to that show ""Lost""..and how the sold out.  This is not like that.  It leave you thinking.",1475107200,4,1724,4.377358490566038

3323650,4,B0012GTPPM,"Pretty good so far 3 episodes in. It took 3 episodes to really hook me, though, so give it a chance.

Detective, mystery, scifi action type series. The lead character is cool. Acting is average to good, sets are nice. It's well done, writing is realistic and material. I gave it four stars for plot development and for being interesting. After the 3rd epi, I'm hooked.

Plus, if you have Prime, it's free!

The interesting aspect isn't the parallel universes, although much more interesting than the impossibility of time travel. (Einstein never said you could ""time travel."" that was a Hollywood misconception. He said if you could get close enough to a black hole, time would move more slowly, and if you could come back, you would see a world ""in the future"" as time ""moves"" slower at higher gravity--which is proven. Five minutes in a near black hole would equal 50 years in out time.) Any scifi that relies on time travel is extremely boring to me. I mean, why not just go back a little further and undo the undo ad infinitum? Parallel Universes cannot be that easily dismissed.

Anyway, the sci-fi aspect of it is not the most interesting, although the technology is interesting vs other universes, which is a cool device, but what I find interesting is how all of the characters are a piece of the puzzle, and how they interact through the parallel universes in away that show different aspects of personalities for all of the same characters and the implication that we can make our world what we want, full of socipathic corporate goons that write sociopathic laws in a polluted and dying world, or as beautiful as a universe comprised of laws that benefit all people who live according to human compassion and love. It's not that original, but the way the story is told is artistic and clever, surreal, and mesmerizing due to the colors, ambient sounds, sets, and beautiful scenes from around the world. It's more like an abstract painting than a realism.

That is why I gave it four stars, and not a high 3 star rating. It's a thinking persons series. It's interesting and believable, and the acting and writing are realistic.",1473638400,17,2137,4.7032085561497325

There's a lot of shifting back and forth in time, and though there's a voiceover of the eponymous character, the point of view changes a lot.  There's a lot of head-hopping.  Even Reena gets to have a few seconds of voiceover in episode 2 (I think).  And the writing of the voiceover is worse than Deckard's in Blade Runner.  The concept of the voiceover is terrible.

Plenty of twists and turns, intrigue and drama. The cinematography is awesome. The director creates a visual feel for each universe, so well, that the screen tags telling which verse the story is in, isn't really needed.

Some of the secondary characters are not very well acted. For me many of the episodes dragged and I fast forwarded.

8245878,3,B0012GTPPM,"Initially watched because it was free and even though the first episode left me with a 'what's going on here', I continued to watch.

I really think the theme of the show was awesome - the ruined Alpha universe establishes a link to Gamma & Beta universe to steal their resources -is a unique story line.  However, the way the story is told .. left much to be desired.  It was often weird, and left the viewer with no information to put the story together.  I especially disliked the repetitive dialog, like it was a skip in the film reel.  You never really got a feel for how Alpha got to be in a ruined situation or how the class system worked.  Plus, there seemed to be oddities like .. why doesn't Charlie ask what year it is when he finds himself in Beta? Instead he acts defensive & moody to poor Karl who's only trying to help him.  Note: Karl was my fav character <3

If the series ended at episode 19, I would have been happy, but the 20th episode was a strange way to wrap things up with no explanation as to why Charlie & O1 Boxer were able to come together to open & join all the universes (maybe a good vs evil theme?).  Perhaps I missed the reason, but that's the way the whole series went for me - understanding some of the story line, but not enough to come to any conclusion.

If they had season 2 I would watch it.

This is a detailed story and can be hard to follow if you skip things because everything is connected.  Pay close attention to which universe each person is living in.  Gamma, AlphaVerse, BetaVerse each are unique worlds and the story is in the details.
