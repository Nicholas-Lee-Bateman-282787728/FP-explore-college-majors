8576006,1,B00C00UR3S,It's one of those things where a comic cant make a living as a stand up comic so he decides to make money on the side selling a dvd of himself.  Horrible junk.  He's also the same comic that got kicked off of Americas Got Talent TV show for stealing another comics work.  Great to get comic advise from a guy that steals his jokes.  Horrible DVD  save your money.,1398556800,,363,4.128571428571429
