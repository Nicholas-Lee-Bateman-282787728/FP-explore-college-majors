8408066,4,B003XF1VHU,"Tom Conway is sober and sharp, doing a silky smooth job in a Falcon type role. An example of the era in British mystery films, cheaply made but the stamp collecting subject matter is interesting. The sidekick named Barney is well-played and enjoyable. I love the long, extended sequences of  actual Lockheed Constellation aircraft landings, and the Jaguar auto in original condition. Early 50's nostalgia for fans of such things.",1432339200,5,429,5.128571428571429
