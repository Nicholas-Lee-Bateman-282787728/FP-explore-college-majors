8047193,3,B0007GADX6,"Best known for films like 'Cure' and 'Pulse' that chill the spine more than warm the heart, Kurosawa is the dark prince of the Japanese new wave. After the series of horror quick videos,he emerged onto the film scene with the psycho-thriller, Cure(1997),then made this film before the state-of-the- nation masterpiece, 'Tokyo Sonata'.Dilapidated buildings,cold barren landscapes,the disaffected,drifting young with no future,shot on digital video by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. The use of luminous symbolism,the acclimatising of a pet red glowing jellyfish to fresh water. This is a movie about a charismatic killer,Mamoru, who through his friend sends a swarm of home-bred mutant beasts into the world to continue doing his murderous bidding after he sheds his mortal coil. Characters that are bored to death,who have nohope. They have inherited miserable lives. Mamoru(Asano Tadanobu) having been imprisoned for killing his complacent boss's family and his boss, advances Yuji(Joe Odagiri) towards his destiny. Yuji's acclimatization of the jellyfish to freshwater is symbolic of Yuji's adjustment to the world and coming to grips with it,finalized by the accidental release of the jellyfish into the city system of sewers and waterways. They metaphorically force their environment to accept their demands instead of the other way around. Some beautiful imagery here.

Sometimes the narrative surface, aided by long takes and a static camera,is submerged by the subtext,where interesting ideas and effective moments do not quite gel into a fully satisfying whole. The representation of the generation gaps as well as the dreary disillusionment captured by the cinematography are excellent. Kurosawa - no relation to Akira - is one of the best directors out there at withholding information in a dramatically interesting way; he sucks almost all traditional personality from his characters, leaving only the most poignant and potent core ideas. The focus of the story becomes Yuji's emergence from his bubble of aimless disaffection into finding purpose and direction through learned responsibility. The failed father(Tatsua Fuji) and the not much more successful surrogate son devote all their energy to raising a colony of little creatures, which they have the hardest time letting go of,refusing to acknowledge that the critters are old enough to take care of themselves,but discovering a sense of gratification when the young do finally swim out to sea. The film's ending with an army of neon-head-phoned thrillseekers marching along to a popular song walking out onto the road with an army of followers was ambiguous but superb,leaving you to draw your own conclusions about the `Bright Future'.",1309651200,3,2691,5.5157384987893465

""Bright Future"" is a mystical film.  I use that term in the sense that something other than logic is driving events.  The film has a contingent plot structure with Mamoru's murder of his former boss seemingly coming abruptly and without explanation.  The visual effects with the iridescent jellyfish are visually stunning.  Perhaps Mamoru identifies with the jellyfish because they are beautiful & lethal.  The ending sequence raised questions for me.

This film is well-paced, visually stunning, with strong performances and relationships between the main characters.  Enjoy!",1212364800,7,1264,6.073446327683616

8047196,4,B0007GADX6,"Bright Future (Kiyoshi Kurosawa, 2002)

Kiyoshi Kurosawa gets away from the niche he's carved out in the atmospheric-horror genre for this odd little comedy/drama that features a seriously loaded cast and a truly absurd premise. Fans of Kurosawa should be warned that there aren't any ghosts, serial killers, or creepy crawling children to be found here, though you do get some poisonous jellyfish and a bit of senseless (and completely offscreen) violence. Also, those who come to this because of critics' likening it to the films of David Lynch might be best warned that this is not the best entrance point into the world of Kurosawa, despite its Palme d'Or nomination; the (justly) internationally-renowned Cure is a great place to start. Come back to this one, but make sure you do.

Nimura (Azumi's Jo Odagiri) and Arita (The Last Life in the Universe's Tadanobu Asano) are brothers who spend their time slacking off in arcades when not working at a towel factory. Their boss, Fujiwara (The Hidden Blade's Takashi Sasano) is a well-meaning guy, if a bit obnoxious. He certainly doesn't deserve to have his entire family slaughtered, but Arita does so, for no reason that anyone can discern, and goes to prison for life. He passes the care of the only thing in the world that matters to him-- a poisonous jellyfish he's trying to adapt to life in fresh water-- to Nimura. Their father Shinichiro (Tatuya Fuji, recently seen in The Man in White), shaken by Arita's act, attempts to heal the rift that's developed between Nimura and him.

Kurosawa is a fine director; if any of the new crop of young Japanese autuers deserves to carry the Kurosawa name, it's Kiyoshi (though he is no relation to the more famous filmmaker to bear that surname). His movies are sparse, understated affairs where far more goes on between the lines than in them, and Bright Future is no exception to this. Expect a slow, deliberate drama, and there's a lot to be gotten out of this; Kurosawa gets top performances out of his actors every time, and he retains cinematographer Takahide Shimanushi (S&eacute;ance) , who's done fine work for him previously. The Lynch comparison comes in not only in the absurdity of the basic premise, but in the way Kurosawa and Shimanushi shot this film; Kurosawa knows chiaroscuro, and exploits it, much as Lynch (or, more recently, David Fincher) does. More stuff happens in David Lynch pictures, though. Here, you're just supposed to watch it, then spend a lot of time thinking about it. The payoff is great, though ""understated"" is perhaps not strong enough a word. A lovely little film. *** ",1173744000,,2610,4.871621621621622
8047197,4,B0007GADX6,"Kiyoshi Kurosawa is becoming one of my favorite current filmmakers, and the further he gets from by-the-book J-horror (preferring to reach further into less categorizable reaches of his own cinematic imagination), the better I think he is.

Deeper meanings mingle with absurdist humor, and the kind of chance occurrences that enliven the fiction of Paul Auster and Haruki Murakami also figure heavily in Kurosawa's films; cinematically, everything from Lynch or Fellini to ""Dirty Harry"" can be a touchstone for further exploration.

BRIGHT FUTURE is like an improved CHARISMA - more refined, less loony, and considerably more poetic, but Kiyoshi Kurosawa's many thematic concerns - trashing of the environment, a sense of depersonalization (and discreet nihilism) in younger/future generations, the erosion of a society's cohesiveness (especially when that erosion originates within, and not from some external source) - are handled very well - the last shot offers his darkest and most ironic humor, with the cross-generational understanding becoming something quietly heroic evoking certain past masters of Japanese film. A sense that - if younger generations have drifted towards a nihilism that could destroy them or you, it is balanced by an equally withering take on the older generations that somehow let them down; this film in many ways visualizes the idea of getting over it, and moving on with life (after presenting some of the consequences for not doing so).

Tadanobu Asano's presence here is somewhat hyped (definitely on the DVD cover), undoubtedly due to his ascendant global stardom, but his performance here is eclipsed by co-stars Joe Odagiri and Tatsuya Fuji, who both deliver dynamic performances of great range and control.

Mysterious, poetic, beautifully shot (on DV), open to many interpretations, and one of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's finest.

8047198,4,B0007GADX6,"Having lived in Japan, I connected with this film immmediately. I would say that this type of Japanese filmmaking is a lot like the soaps that air on Japanese television. No incredible lighting effects, excessive props or music scores. The camera basically sits their and shows people and what they do. That's about it. I highly doubt anyone who is not Japanese or does not have an idea about what Japanese culture is like will like this film. I'm not going to go on like some people and talk about the ""artistic value"" of the film. The film is what it is, a story about a couple of guys who try to get a jellyfish to swim in fresh water.",1143072000,6,638,4.325
8047199,4,B0007GADX6,"Many viewers look at Bright Future and throw up their hands in

confusion, even those who admire Kurosawa's style. I've thought a lot

about this movie and I don't think its intentions are that obscure,

though I confess it can be inaccessible. It's just that Kurosawa's

approach is VERY contrary to how Westerners understand film.

Bright Future examines the disillusionment of Japanese youth towards

their parents' generation, and, in turn, their parents' feelings of

failure towards their children. Throughout, a poisonous red jellyfish

symbolizes disaffected youth, drifting along silently, not threatening

unless you cross their path.

Namura and Arita are two 20-somethings working at an industrial

laundry. Namura is apathy itself. He cherishes his dreams of a ""bright

future,"" but in his daily life, he barely registers much more than a

blank stare. He's such a loser he even sucks at his few hobbies; the

one time he goes out to an arcade with his upwardly-mobile sister and

her yuppie boyfriend, the boyfriend casually kicks Namura's ass at

games Namura plays constantly. On his lone trips to a nearby bowling

alley, Namura rolls mostly gutters.

Arita, Namura's only friend, is more mysterious, with a placid surface

underneath which lurks hints of menace. Arita's sole hobby is the care

of his pet jellyfish, which he is trying to acclimate to fresh water.

Arita gives the clueless Namura hand signals (thumb inward means

""wait,"" finger pointing means ""go ahead"") so he'll avoid doing anything

""crazy."" Namura isn't sure what to make of this, but we get hints Arita

is more in tune with prevailing moods. ""There's a storm coming,"" he

says ominously.

The boys' boss at the laundry lamely attempts to court their

friendship, borrowing a CD from Namura and popping up uninvited at

Arita's apartment. There he goes into a pathetic speech about ""When I

was your age..."", but loses his train of thought and gets caught up

watching cable. Namura and Arita view this middle-aged boy-man with

barely concealed contempt; you can tell they're thinking, ""God, is this

what I have to look forward to when I'm 55?"" When the boss sticks his

fingers in the jellyfish tank, Arita stops Namura from warning him

about the poison.

The boss, when he learns what could have happened, confronts Arita, who

quits his job the next day. The boss remains friendly to Namura,

throwing the socially inept young man into further confusion. That

night, Namura angrily goes to the boss's house to get his CD, only to

find Arita has been there earlier and murdered the man and his wife.

Arita is arrested but makes no particular attempt at a defense. In

jail, he cordially (but not warmly) greets his estranged father, and

only wants to talk about his jellyfish to Namura, in whom he has

entrusted its care. But when Namura, in a rare emotional outburst,

declares he will ""wait 20 years"" for Arita's release, Arita coldly

snubs him. Now even more bereft and confused, Namura angrily smashes

the jellyfish tank, inadvertently releasing it into the city canals.

Not long after, Arita hangs himself in his cell, his hand wired into

the ""go ahead"" signal. Namura regrets his rashness, and is overjoyed to

find the jellyfish still alive. He also strikes up a bond with Arita's

father, who makes a meager living salvaging discarded appliances (a

metaphor for pointlessly hanging onto the past). The father, who hadn't

seen Arita for 5 years before the murders, and who is held in such

disdain by his one other son that the boy has taken his mother's last

name, sees in Namura the chance for a real father-son relationship.

I've concluded that we're supposed to see Arita and Namura as two

different incarnations of the same person. This interpretation would be

consistent with Kurosawa's follow-up, Doppelgnger, whose hero

confronts an arrogant and violent duplicate of himself. Bright Future's

script hints that Kurosawa may have intended this:

At one point Namura says he thinks Arita killed the boss ""before I

could do it""; indeed, right before Namura goes to the house, we see him

grab a metal pipe off the street and swing it in wild unfocused rage.

In another scene, we see Arita's ghost(?) watching his father and

Namura. Also, the way Arita's father cherishes his bond with Namura; a

reconciliation after an argument they have plays like the father is

really forgiving Arita and his other son for abandoning him (especially

the father's line ""I forgive all of you for everything""). Finally,

Arita's rejection of Namura when Namura declares he'll wait for him in

prison; if Arita is really Namura's ""evil doppelgnger,"" then the

rejection makes good thematic sense. It's Arita's way of saying, ""You

idiot, don't you know that as long as you hang onto me, you'll always

be a loser?""

So is Arita the violent, acting-out side of Namura's personality made

flesh, who, once he commits the crime Namura fantasizes about, feels

it's time to give Namura the ""go ahead"" signal and bow out? An

intriguing possibility, and one certainly in keeping with Kurosawa's

magical realist approach.

The final scenes, in which Namura - saying ""I got my go-ahead signal

long ago"" - finally decides to stop drifting aimlessly (like the

jellyfish in the tank) and set himself towards the ""bright future"" he

used to dream of (like the loose jellyfish, now ""escaping"" from Tokyo

and drifting toward the sea), brings the movie's theme full circle. The

climactic shot of hordes of glowing jellyfish floating down a canal is

a truly stunning image. (And one thematically underscored by its

juxtaposition with the very last shot, of a gang of kids Namura briefly

falls in with, drifting aimlessly down the sidewalk to nowhere in

particular.) The title turns out to be not ironic at all. The young can

have a bright future, but sometimes, you have to know when to wait, and

when to go ahead.",1118016000,37,5922,4.928861788617886
8047200,3,B0007GADX6,"I can see the maddeningly inscrutable ""Bright Future"" serving as the subject for some poor film school student's dissertation in a course entitled ""The Use of Enigma and Symbolism in Post-Modernist Cinema""  or (if you prefer the vernacular) ""What the Heck Was That Film All About Anyway?""  For I am absolutely convinced that one could spend a full semester - at the very least - trying to fathom the various levels of meaning in this film and never come up with a thoroughly satisfactory answer at the end of that search.  And here I've always thought Ingmar Bergman movies were a challenge!

Shot through with heavy doses of allegory and Magic Realism, ""Bright Future"" tells the story of a sullen, moody young man named Yuji, who works at a dull factory job with his close buddy, Mamoru.  The latter owns a deadly Red Jellyfish that he keeps in a little tank at home.  One day, he gives the jellyfish as a present to Yuji, telling him that he has decided to quit the job and move on to bigger and better things.  But instead of doing that, Mamoru murders the boss and the boss' wife, with little or no explanation given as to motive.  Mamoru is immediately arrested and charged with first degree murder.  Meanwhile, in a fit of despair, Yuji turns over the tank, only to have the jellyfish slide through the cracks of the floor and somehow land in the Tokyo water system, where it miraculously proliferates to the point where the area is literally inundated with freshwater killer jellyfish.  While all this is going on, Yuji begins to develop a close but tentative bond with Mamoru's father, who was pretty much estranged from his son before the murder.  As Yuji gets more and more obsessed with finding the elusive jellyfish, he seems, paradoxically, to be coming to a greater sense of reality.  Well, there's the ""plot"" in a nutshell; now it's your turn to try to figure it all out.

If none of this makes any sense to you, don't feel bad because it doesn't make any sense to me either.  The best I can make of it is that Yuji is intended to represent the younger generation in modern day Japan - disconnected, rudderless, utterly lacking in motivation, purpose and goals, and prone to act out of ill-defined impulse rather than rationality and logic.  And somehow, Mamoru, by committing the murder that Yuji is actually intending to do (though here again, we are given no preparation or motive to explain WHY he would do so), is really sacrificing himself so that Yuji can be saved from his own spiritual ennui and set on the path towards a meaningful life, primarily by caring for this jellyfish, which is itself a symbol of tenacity and beauty.

Or perhaps not....

Despite the fact that the film will probably have you pulling your hair out in bewilderment and frustration, ""Bright Future,"" for all its self-conscious pretentiousness, is actually a fairly intriguing film just on the level of its visuals and the relationships it develops among the various characters.  It's very well directed and very well acted, and if you can get beyond the symbol-gazing, you may actually find yourself mesmerized by the experience.

And I will be expecting those dissertations on my desk bright and early tomorrow morning.",1114300800,12,3219,4.736559139784946
8047201,3,B0007GADX6,"This film ends with one of the most ironic shots I have ever seen.  I won't spoil it here, only I'll say that those who are optimistic about our future should check out this film.  The film deals with two men who attempt to create a freshwater jellyfish. Do they do it for any specific scientific purpose? No, just to keep busy. In that respect this film has a close cousin in ""Primer,"" as that film dealt with another group of men who were pretty much cogs in The Man's machine.  Both films show these men striving for greatness and in the end being truly great at messing up the world.  In this film the title implies that we all want a bright future. Nobody wants to be stuck at dead end jobs until the end of time, least of all these characters.  And while living in a capitalistic society may well encourage that kind of behavior this film has reservations about it.  To do so makes it so that you have to dump on other people's lives too and proclaim them insignificant.  Also, and more importantly, just because you are doing something doesn't mean the world is better off because of it.  In today's world we can have people who do nothing more that cook books and shuffle papers but they are declared important because they have a ""real job"" and thus can show their face at the family reunions.  Meanwhile, their work is cheating Americans out of their pensions. On the other hand food service workers do nothing but make people lunch. They (in general) aren't out to destroy anybody, and even if they were they wouldn't have the means of going about it.  However, they cannot show their face around their family because they are not successful enough.  So for attacking our mind set in this country and in Japan (where this film is from) I applaud them.  On the downside this film bought into the idea that the slower a film moves the more profound it is.  As with so many of today's Asian films nothing really happens. I understand they like mood over narrative, I just don't understand why they like boredom over narrative.  Also, I don't think that the film dug as deep as it possibly could have. Why not use the murder in the beginning in a more purposeful way?  Why are the hooligans necessary?  It is because of those reasons that I will not recommend this film, although I was very close.  The cinematography was also very beautiful. The film has a feel all its own, and the jellyfish is a wonder to behold. ***",1111795200,5,2427,4.442437923250564
