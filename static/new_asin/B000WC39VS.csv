8222398,5,B000WC39VS,"I have no prblems with the movie itself, it's extremely funny and well worth the money I paid. However, I am slightly disappointed in amazon's product information as it was misleading and I was looking forward to seeing this colorized after having seen it Black & White.

Despite the deceiving colorize photos, THIS MOVIE IS BLACK & WHITE. At the time of this review I requested an update to the product info, which also erroneously states the movie is in color. See the following quote from Internet Movie Database...

-""Marilyn Monroe wanted the film to be shot in color (her contract stipulated that all her films were to be in color), but Billy Wilder convinced her to let it be shot in black and white when costume tests revealed that the makeup that Tony Curtis and `Jack Lemmon' wore gave their faces a green tinge.""-",1203120000,6,824,4.675862068965517
