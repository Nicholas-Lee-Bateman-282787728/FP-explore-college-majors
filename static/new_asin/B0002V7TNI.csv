2121204,5,B0002V7TNI,"Even though all the previous 'STAR TREK' series were filmed in color, their stories were, for the most part, BLACK&WHITE..... And then came DS9, a study of Gene Roddenberry's universe in complex shades of gray. With thought provoking episodes like 'The Darkness and the Light', in which Kira is forced to confront the consequences of her actions as a member of the Bajorian resistance (considered a terrorist group by the Cardassians), and 'In the Pale Moonlight', where Sisco finds himself an unwitting accomplice in the assassination of a Romulan Senator and then an active participant in it's cover-up, DS9 will challenge as well as entertain you.",1121558400,12,650,5.1415094339622645
2121205,5,B0002V7TNI,"I saw this series when it first aired and I have seen it in syndication many times since. I even watch it now on the Spike channel. It is by far one of my favorite Star Trek's or any TV series for that matter. The last few seasons were especially exciting. It is amazing how you watch the characters grow over the years. I can't say enough positive things about this series. Sisko, Nerys, Odo, Jadzia, Worf, Quark, Bashir, and Garak added wonderful characters that really made a difference to me. The guest stars were great too. The directing, cast, stories, sets, music, and the rest the production are first class all the way. If you are a fan of SciFi and not buying a number of other TV series, buy this set.

Now that said, I would like to say Paramount needs to be slapped up side the head for being so greedy, and that is saying it nicely. I can buy a season of ANY other Non-Paramount series for half or less the price. Why are you making us fans of Star Trek suffer? Do you think, oh they are Star Trek fans, they will pay anything? Give us some credit. I am not buying this series unless you lower the price. I bought all the original Star Trek series and even three seasons of Next Generation. But after spending over $650 for six seasons I realized this is absurd. I bought six seasons of Stargate SG-1, a great series, for under $300 with tax. Here's a concept Paramount, sell it reasonable so you will make more sales and your customers will appreciate you.

I decided to go ahead and get this set since they at least give a break for buying all seven seasons together. Do not use Amazon overnight or two day shipping unless you are home all day. I paid for two day shipping but I didn't know Amazon would insist the package be signed for in person. UPS took four days to finally bring it by when I was home after work after they said they couldn't except a signed receipt and I then told them to come after 5 PM.

This set is FANTASTIC. Even better than I remembered. For some odd reason my wife and I thought the first couple seasons weren't all that good. Now that we are watching them again, we are very impressed with all the episodes. The only thing I can figure is at the time they were originally shown we were more interested in TNG since they were exploring space and we thought a space station was not as interesting. Seeing them now I realize that was just not true and we did it an injustice thinking that way.

ADDENDUM: Don't buy thses for more than fifty-five a season. I have seen them for that and and now kicking myself for paying this price. Furthermore they have now brought down the price on STTNG set and I bet this is next.",1119225600,142,2661,4.273809523809524
2121206,4,B0002V7TNI,"My wife and I are Star Trek fans, we have always watched one series or another together.  I was a bit wary of this one, because I remember how I didn't think the plots or characters were as good as the original ST and STNG and we didn't make it to the end because we moved overseas.  But we got a far less expensive version from Amazon UK (about 1/4 the US price), so I thought, why not?

Watching them a couple episodes at a time, I was astounded to find that I had completely misjudged this show:  there is a plot that progresses on several fronts, significant development of character, and a whole host of new themes introduced.

I would characterize the episodes in several categories.  First, there is the principal plot line, i.e. that the wormhole has put the Federation in contact with aliens from the other side as well as the timeless, God-like entities that live within it.  Second, there is the conflict with the Cardassian Empire, which goes from tense to outright war.  Third, there are time travel episodes, a genre that is one of my personal favorites for the paradoxes, etc.  Fourth, there are the parallel universe ones, the place that Kirk left Spock in charge of from the original series; it is a truly horrible place where everyone is seemingly ruthless, cruel, and stupid.  I find these pretty weak, as if they're grasping at straws to revive an exhausted format.  Finally, there are filler stories, which vary widely in quality, sometimes they're even supposed to be comedy, melodrama, or adventure intrigues.

There are cross-cutting character themes that advance in every episode.  I think the most intriguing one is the nature of Sisko, who serves as the messenger of the prophets within the wormhole.  The other characters are all fun, too, such as Kira (a personal favorite), Quark and family, the symbionts, and the others that are too numerous to categorize.  Over the 7-year run, they evolve and grow and some even die.  THere are also many new concepts, such as the changlings and their minions, which represent a radical departure, e.g. the Jem Hadar.  It adds up to a pretty dazzling array.

In terms of criticism, a lot of the episodes are clearly second-rate filler.  This is inevitable with a series, of course, but I think they could have done better, particularly in the 7th season with the hottest part of the war and the wrapup - the producers in one of the extras complained that they could have spent much more time, so why didn't thy instead of doing silly episodes like the ones in the holosuite?  Finally, the war ended too neatly and quickly.

Recommended.  I give this 4 stars only because the quality was a bit uneven.",1119225600,,2667,4.6781115879828326

2121208,5,B0002V7TNI,"When i finished the series i was sad that it was all over. I really enjoyed the story line.  The ending was sad for sisko,but was a good way to end the series.  Felt lost as you would feel after a good book is ended.",1117411200,4,216,3.7777777777777777
2121209,5,B0002V7TNI,"I just finished the last episode of Deep Space Nine, called ""What You Leave Behind,"" after watching every single episode in order.  All 176 of them.

I am convinced that DS9 is the best acted, written, directed, and produced television series of all time, not just of the Star Treks.  It goes far beyond standard science fiction and ventures into the realm of things like spirituality and even metaphysics.  It's the best Star Trek series because it is the most realistic.  The other series are mainly episodic, with the Enterprise crew solving whatever problem they encounter, and then triumphantly warping off into space at the end of the episode, having no bearing on the following episode.  With DS9, the characters and their relationships are very real, complex, and developed, and they face the consequences of their actions for the rest of the series.  Also, the very black-and-white good-vs.-evil of most of the rest of Star Trek is totally gone here.  Everything is a much more realistic shade of grey.  You see the good guys forced to do things that are not moral.  You feel compassion for the bad guys.

As for the original Star Trek series from the 60s, it's too cheesy for me to take very seriously (although it's to be expected of its era, and I admittedly have never seen a whole episode).  As for Voyager (1995-2001), while it does have some good episodes, the best word I have seen someone use to describe it is ""anemic.""  And of the new series, Enterprise (2001-2005), I've only seen a couple episodes but it doesn't interest me too much.

Deep Space Nine is often neglected, since it was sort of the ""middle child"" between TNG and Voyager.  But while all of the other series have more or less the same premise (a starship flying around and exploring space), DS9 is set on a space station in a region reeling from the recently-ended and bloody Cardassian occupation of Bajor.  Next to the station is a wormhole that not only connects the Alpha Quadrant with the Gamma Quadrant but is also the home of the Prophets, the noncorporeal aliens who are the Bajoran gods.  There is nothing else like it in all of Star Trek.  Especially starting with the 3rd season (though the 2nd season has a lot of good stuff too) and getting even better in the 4th and 5th, and becoming unbelievably good in seasons 6 and 7.  Plus there are episodes with amazingly cool titles like ""Whispers"", ""Rapture"", ""In Purgatory's Shadow"", ""By Inferno's Light"", ""Far Beyond the Stars"", ""Wrongs Darker than Death or Night"", ""In the Pale Moonlight"" (which is often accepted as not only the best episode of Deep Space Nine, but of any Star Trek series), ""Image in the Sand"", ""It's Only a Paper Moon"", ""The Changing Face of Evil"", and ""When it Rains..."".  And of course ""What You Leave Behind,"" which I think is the best title the series could end with.

The Next Generation (1987-1994) I have always loved.  But as a series on the whole, the richly developed, growing characters and continuing storylines that run throughout the entire series of DS9, from 1993 when its pilot aired to the final episode of 1999, are so compelling that it narrowly edges out TNG as my favorite Star Trek series.  After TNG, there's a huge gap and then the others kind of land in a limp, half-hearted pile an indeterminate distance below.",1111449600,32,3304,4.697916666666667
2121210,5,B0002V7TNI,"Star Trek Deep Space Nine will always be the cult within the cult. Although not as popular as the other Star Trek spin-offs(even the anemic Voyager who had the benefit of the UPN network behind it),it has the diehard follwing of Trekker Niners who'll easily attest that DS9 was the best Trek show ever.
Unlike the other spin-offs,the show as well as the characters evolved in its seven seasons. Notably The lead character Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) who started as a brooding arbitrator of a rundown space station. In the later seasons, the character was injected with the same passion that fueled Kirk and Picard,becoming a great Captain as well as accepting his role as the Bajoran's Emissary and in the end,joined the Bajoran prophets. Sisko's crew includes first officer/Bajoran lieson Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor),Trill science officer Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell),Cheif Medical Officer Dr Julian Bashir(Alexander Siddig),Cheif of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and changeling Security Chief Odo (Rene Abourjonios).Station residences includes Ferengi Barkeeper Quark (Armin Shimmerman), Cardassian Tailor, former spy Garak (Andy Robinson) and Sisko's son Jake (Cirroc Lofton).
Although known as the darkest of all the Trek shows(despite having some of the most humorous episodes in the entire franchise)DS9 has the most complex storytelling ever to come out of Gene Roddenberry's universe.
In season one we have the humble beginnings of the station formerly known as Terok Nor. Sisko was more of an administrator than the passionate individual he is to become,Kira Nerys is unsettlingly fiesty,Julian Bashir rates high on the arrogent meter,and Jadzia Dax comes off as somewhat aloof. The shakedown season still plays better than the latter seasons of any of the following Trek Series(Voyager,Enterprise).The standout episodes include Past Prologue,Captive Pursuit,Progress,In The Hands Of The Prophets,and Duet,which in many opinion, is the best ever DS9 episode.
With the final season of TNG over shadowing,as well as the upcoming Voyager series in the wings ,DS9 was trying to find it's footing in the second season. Besides character development,we see the seeds of events begin to evolve,including the rise (and eventual downfalls) of Kai Winn & Gul Dukat,the re-introduction of The Original Series ""Mirror,Mirror"" Universe,as well as the dreaded Dominion.
The standout episodes includes Cardassians,Whispers,Blood Oath,The Maquis,The Wire,and The Collaborator.
Season two ends with the ominous The Jem'hadar,preparing us for a direction never seen in Star Trek
With the Dominion threat,and the introdution of the battleship,Defiant,DS9's third season was finally coming into it's own.
Along with more character development in the lead as well as the supporting cast(Garak,Dukat,Kai Winn,Rom & Nog),the writing was even stronger than before with great episodes such as House Of Quark,Civil Defense,Second Skin,Visionary,Past Tense,and Explorers. Also introduced in this season are Leeta,Ishka(""Moogie""),Brunt,Shaakar,and Lt. Commander Eddington.
Unfortunately with Star Trek Generation hitting the big screen,and Star Trek Voyager's big premire,DS9 was lost in the shuffle. But it would use it's underdog status to emerge as the greatest Trek series the following season.
The final ingredient that was needed in DS9,Worf becomes a member of the crew in the fourth season,and it will never be the same again.
Not only it was Starfleet's Klingon officer's introduction,but Way of the Warrior was DS9's most exciting episode(it's equivelent of TNG's Best Of Both Worlds),dealing with the Federation-Klingon Empire relation being strained and underminded by the Dominion,which concluded with the greatest battle scenes ever seen on televised Trek.
Sisko ,promoted to Captain in the previous season,finally emerges as a commanding presence,in part to his image makover including a bald head & goatee.
Many classic episodes including WOTW,The Visitor,Little Green Men,Our Man Bashir,Rejoined,The Sons Of Mogh,Bar Association,Hard Time,and Broken Link which concludes with a surprise ending for the season.
This is the season where the writers & producers realise that the show will never come close to being the success that TNG was,and decided to make the show something to be proud of and making it's place be known in the Star Trek Universe.
 DS9's fifth season proves there is so much more to the show once described about a station that didn't ""go anywhere"".When most TV shows wear out their welcome by season five,ST-DS9 just kept getting better
One of the factors is the strong writing,as well as the characters evolution(Worf & Dax's romantic relationship,Bashir's genetic enhancement secret)and such classic episodes as,Looking For Par'Mach In All The Wrong Places,The Ship,Children Of Time,By Inferno's Light/In Purgotory's Shadow,and Trials and Tribble-ation(featuring the original ST crew).
The season ends with the beginning of the Dominion War which has been building up since season three.
In the sixth season ,you come to realise that it's far removed from the premise of a darker edgier Trek of the first two seasons ,only to emerged as the greatest Trek show of all time.
The writing had become more ambitious than any other latter day Trek Series(TNG,VOY,ENT),and it was only the penultimate season. The six-part Dominion War Arc(including classic episodes A Time To Stand,Rocks & Shoals,The Sacrifice Of Angels) showed the producers going for broke as well as establishing DS9 as a show that's not afraid to take chances.
The best season six episodes are too many to list(....Cordially Invited...,Waltz,Far Beyond The Stars,Inquisition,His Way,Reckoning,The Valient),but it's In The Pale Moonlight that is the highlight of the entire season(as well as my 3rd favorite episode behind season one's ""Duet"",and four's""The Way Of The Warrior"")as Captain Sisko wrestles with his conscience as Garak helps him to dupe the Romulans into joining their efforts in the war. The season ends on a dark tone with ""Tears Of The Prophet"" in which Jadzia Dax is killed by a Pah-Wraith possessed Dukat.
  Although season six staked DS9's claim as Star Trek's best ever show,the seventh, and finale season of DS9,coming after a three season winning streak,hits a bump during the season ,yet it was still superior than any other show of it's genre .
The death of Jadzia Dax somewhat took the wind out of the series,and the new Dax,Ezri(Nicole DeBoer)an unprepared new Trill host,was written as""Ally McTrill"",only to emerge as more comfortable with the roll as the show wound down.
Some episodes ranged from mediocre(Prodigal Daughter) to downright weak(The Emperor's New Cloak,Extreme Measures) .Aside from the Finale Arc(including Penumbra,Strange Bedfellows,Tacken To The Wind & Dogs Of War),Take Me Out To The Holosuite,The Siege at AR 558,Chimara and Inter Arma...ranks as some of DS9's greatest episodes. The ten part finale arc which ended with What You Leave Behind closed the show on a fitting yet premature ending.
Paramount released the DVD sets throughout 2003(the tenth anniversary of DS9)as well as insatiate the many fans of this brilliant yet overlooked show(hopefully a series of TV movies in the future),reminding us of how great DS9 was,and that hopefully we'll return to her someday.

2121386,5,B0002V7TNI,"The show itself needs no introduction, so I'm only reviewing the product from a value-for-money perspective.

Why do you want to buy this set when the whole show is available to stream on Netflix/Amazon/CBS All Access? Paramount may never re-master Deep Space Nine or Voyager, but they still kept one single advantage only to the DVDs of those two shows: both shows are available in Dolby Digital surround sound only on DVD, so yes, even if you buy the seasons on iTunes, you'd be paying for more than the cost of the DVD set, but only getting stereo. If you love Star Trek and you have a decent home sound system, you simply don't want to watch any Star Trek show in stereo.

Also, I see a lot of older reviews complaining about the packaging. First, I have to say I've seen how cheap Paramount can be with their packaging, so I never had high expectations. The outer boxes for both Deep Space Nine and Voyager are sturdier than their other shows. I bought them from Best Buy, and they were carefully packaged, but unavoidably some discs still fell off during shipping. So far though, I haven't seen any disc scratched. Therefore, I believe Paramount did improve the packaging since the new sets were first released.",1520553600,,1217,4.62962962962963

I tried cleaning the discs, anyway, with a lint-free microfiber cloth and weak isopropanol solution, to see if it would clear away dirt that I could *not* see. No joy.

2121501,5,B0002V7TNI,"This is an incredible series - unlike 'Voyager', it takes what you think you know about Star Trek and turns it on its head. The characters are so well developed over the series - especially the female characters - Major Kira has to be the most interesting female character in Trek's history. There's some rough episodes in the first season I think because they were trying to make it like Next Generation but from the end of the first season, the series starts to come into its own. As Trek does best, the series is filled with social commentary that deals with colonialism, genocide, racism, sexism, war, religion and theology, terrorism, greed, love, death and in the end, humanity - everything I want from Star Trek. As the series progresses, it gets more serialized and deals with a destructive war within the Federation and it's all handled beautifully. The DVD set itself is fine, I believe it's a re-hash of a previous release - great bonus features if you like interviews with the actors and writers of the series. There's some powerful episodes in this show, The Visitor, Duet, Far Beyond the Stars and In the Pale Moonlight to name a few, some comedic episodes, action packed episodes, it's got it all. Highly recommended. This is the underdog of Star Trek and I mean that in the best possible way.",1505347200,,1308,4.691304347826087

Some discs float free and arrive scratched. The graphics on the case covers are grainy and faded. The DVD menus are awkward. I understand that the show was filmed in a way that prevents a blu ray upgrade, but that doesn't excuse the fuzzy video. It's like a copy of a copy of a VHS. It actually looks worse on DVD than it does on Netflix. If I had seen the packaging before buying it, I'd have thought it was a bootleg.

2121740,5,B0002V7TNI,"I watch Star Trek daily on Netflix and have been waiting to own this series for a long time. I have been buying the box sets of all of the Star Trek series in blu ray as they are now at a much more reasonable price. It is sad  that CBS transferred their original film recordings to video tape and sold the film of Next Generation, DS9, and Voyager. Because of that it now is very expensive and time consuming to get them transferred to blu ray. They tested out the sales on Next Generation when they went through that costly process and because of low sales they decided it would not be worth it for for DS9 or Voyager to be transferred. If they still had the original film we would of had them long ago. So now we are stuck with DVDs on those 2 series until technology makes it easier and cheaper.

This is my favorite of all the Star Trek series. It took 2 seasons for the series to find it's legs but once it did it got really good. It is a different format from the starship exploring new worlds. Instead it focused on a deep season long plot lines. They focus much more on character development and they used a much larger supporting cast then the other series did. The only downside of this series is that if you just want to sit down and watch a random episode (especially in later seasons), you might get lost or not get all the connections that are being made if you did not watch some pervious episodes.",1493942400,9,1413,4.210332103321033
2121741,4,B0002V7TNI,"This is hands down my favorite TV show of all time. I docked it one star for the craptacular packaging. As others have noted, there are a couple of discs stuck into the box with an adhesive disc. One of my discs came loose and had the adhesive stuck to it. After I took a picture of it to keep myself from being sad, I realized that it wasn't completely stuck on. There was a tiny gap I got my thumbnail into and carefully pried it off. Then I washed it with some dish soap and dried it as carefully as I could. As a result there is now a (seemingly) fully functional disc with a small smudge of adhesive residue and some micro-abrasions where before there was a completely unusable disc.

If you're looking for packaging that will stand the test of time, this ain't it. If you just want the shows to load into a digital library, there's probably better ways. But if you're a big fan on a small income, this is a decent bet.",1493856000,5,924,4.191011235955056
2121742,2,B0002V7TNI,"Just purchased this set and it arrived today (May 4th, 2017) and the first thing I did was check the discs for scratches. Specifically the much talked about Season 6 disc 7 that is not even in the book inside the cases but attached by itself to the back of the box its in. Needless to say I a writing this review because mine was loose when it came and has big scratches on it due to the poor packaging these series come in. I knew what to expect because the cases are the same as the ST The Next Generation bluray set which I also own, but I had no issues with that set when I got it. Contacted Paramount (phe_customerservice@paramount.com) about a replacement disc and waiting to hear back. Will update my rating based on the response I get from them.

Note: This review is based purely off the physical item itself , the series is 5/5 IMO. But the series is available to everyone on Netflix if you want to watch it, only reason I bought it was for a physical copy for my collection. The packaging is horrible.

2121767,2,B0002V7TNI,"The series is great. The packaging is hideous. The series comes in three boxed sets: Seasons 1-3, Seasons 4-6, and Season 7. Each box has hinged pages. They tend to fall out, but that's not the problem. The problem is disk 7 of Season 6. It doesn't fit in the hinged pages, so instead they have molded one disk center piece into the box itself. That might be OK; but then somebody decided it would be smart to add a double-sided adhesive disk to stick the DVD to the case -- on the data side of the disk! A sticky mess, even after I peeled it off. I've given the series two stars for the packaging. I'm watching the DVD in question now. If I have any viewing problems, I'll knock it down to one. Nobody should be dumb enough to stick an adhesive on the data side of the DVD.

EDITED TO ADD: I was wrong. The ONLY thing holding the last DVD of season 6 in place was the double-sided adhesive disk. Now there's nothing to keep it from rattling around in the case.

It took me a minute to figure out how to get the discs out but it's an ingenious design: Remember to take each disc out exactly like this or you will have a tough time getting them out: (See my pictures for a demonstration with where I place my fingers to take a disc out)

- For the top disc of each page: place your thumb in the center and your other finger at the top and press in with your thumb and pull the top of the disc towards the center.

- For the bottom disc of each page place your thumb in the center but pull the bottom of the disc towards the center.

The rolodex-style flip books (case 1 and 2) are not connected to the inner case (just like the The Next Generation/Enterprise UK, region free, blu ray releases) and they do come out - so be careful. The cases have 2 discs per page and the second and third cases have one disc on the back-inside of the case.

The DVD set is about what I was expecting - the set comes in two large clam-shell cases (seasons 1-3, and seasons 4-6) and one single season case (season 7). Given the number of the discs and how they are packed - I was surprised to find that none of them had come loose in the cases (a first for me with most collections that I buy like this). The video quality is a bit rough compared to what passes for television today, but given the age of the show and the technological advances in video mastering since then, I'm just happy to have something better than the VHS tapes.

Two of the plastic cases are thick, with the discs attached to a separate plastic divider that is NOT secured to the case.  The plastic cases have two ""closures"" at the top and bottom, one of which was already broken off when I opened it, so the first thick case will not close anymore.
To top it off, when I received the box I could hear discs moving around on the inside.  When opened, I found 3 discs floating loosely in the cases, one of which had scratches on it due to it not being secured.  Which didn't really surprise me, given the state of the cheap plastic dividers and cases.
All in all it was a decent price for a great show, but I am disappointed that CBS didn't try a little harder with the presentation.",1489449600,4,895,4.241176470588235

When I got it there was one disc that had came loose during shipping but wasn't really scratched too bad and the box had some cosmetic damage with a slight tear in the box.

I have read comments on an IndieGogo campaign (What We Left Behind) currently occurring (February 2017) where interests have been raised by participants in getting a re-master of this great series.  I certainly hope it comes to fruition some day.  The documentary being developed should be very interesting and has the support of many of the cast members.  Plus some good perks if you choose to support the effort.",1487894400,,702,4.620967741935484
2121853,3,B0002V7TNI,"I'll get this out of the way early.  Star Trek Deep Space Nine is hands down the finest Star Trek television series made to date.  Rich characters, grand scope, still to this day solid visual effects, and a dark and unforgiving re imagining of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek Universe make DS9 easily one of the greatest Sci-fi shows of all time.  However, the more impressive feat is the fact that DS9 holds up as a great television series outside the lens of science fiction.  I won't spoil the series for you.  Just know that Star Trek DS9 is one of the most underrated television shows in history let alone within the Star Trek Universe.  So....On to the review of this particular DVD Re-Release of Star Trek DS9 in 2017.

The elephant in the room is the fact that these discs are not Blu-Ray.  They are in fact still produced on DVDs.  I am not sure that anyone on the planet still has a functional stand alone DVD player.  This is a tremendous disappointment...If CBS couldn't be bothered to remaster the entire series in HD the way they did with the Next Generation couldn't they at least ported them over to the more reliable Blu-Ray disc format?  On top of the DVD disappointment comes the fact that the menus/GUI haven't been updated since the original DVD release either.  DS9 deserves better than this.  I realize that there is expense in a full re mastery of the disc menus and the series itself but my lord.  As a side note...CBS claims that the expense of re-mastering the series gets cost prohibitive because they would essentially have to do all of the CGI shots (ship battles) from scratch.  Well I am not buying it because there are plenty of fan made video recreations of these scenes on YouTube that look incredible and the people making them are fans not billion dollar companies.  However, that is an argument for another time.

So how does this DVD set stand up in 2017?
The box art and casing is very well done.  The main housing for the individual disc casings is textured, vibrantly colored and looks awesome. There is even a photo of Quark (one of the characters) with Tribbles all over him in the very back of the case which can only be seen once all the contents are removed, a very fan-centric touch.  The video quality is sub standard by today's standards but the best you'll find for this series, same goes for the audio.  Fans who have already purchased DS9 on physical media will find little has changed over the past ten years.  However, the collector will find some very well done box art tempting them back into the DS9 universe.

Ultimately, this DVD re-release of a 15+ year old TV series has seen no enhancements which is a shame because DS9 is the best Trek series to date and deserves better.  However, this should not deter the person who has never seen this show to take a chance on it because they will be handsomely rewarded with a fantastic ensemble of characters playing for big stakes on a galactic scale.",1487721600,4,2952,4.549242424242424

2121856,3,B0002V7TNI,"This is not a review of the show, but of the packaging. Externally my copy was unharmed, but several discs featured a rather remarkable amount of scratches and scuffing. Nothing that could disrupt a modern DVD player, but still extremely disappointing. At least one was cracked in the center, so QA is apparently rock-bottom. Additionally, the 2nd disc box was shattered along the back edge of the seam, and the last disc in the same box was bizarrely fixed to the case with a small disc of foam adhesive, as I write this I am trying to clean it off.

Look closely at your copy when you receive it.",1487548800,14,598,4.486238532110092

2121918,4,B0002V7TNI,"Initially I posted this review with 5stars, but now that Ive opened it several times to watch, it loses one. These clear plastic ""keep"" cases have peculiarities, and if you're not careful, you will wind up with damaged discs. But first, this listing is a prime example of why Amazon needs to continue its due diligence addressing the disparity between older product reviews and the same (nonrefurbished) content just newly repackaged.

OK, so what you receive is a 7.75 x 5.625 x 5.0 cardstock box, with a textured space station decorating two outer sides, that contains three clear plastic keepcases. (Note: No flip discs or paper sleeves here.) The first 2.0 thick protective case contains seasons #13 spread over 20 discs on five hinged pages. The second 2.0 thick protective case contains season #46 spread over 21 DVDs on five hinged pages AND one on the inside back cover. The last 1.0 thick protective case contains the final season (#7) spread over 7 discs on three hinged pages AND one on the inside back cover.

Note: This totals 48 DVDs in all, one more than this listing advertises.

Now for the undesirable peculiarities. These two hinged bundles ARE NOT ATTACHED to the inside of the protective case. Open too roughly and these hinged bundles hit the floor. Furthermore, the 21st disc in the second bundle is attached inside the back cover to a spindle THAT IS NOT molded to the case. Its just stuck in place and my DVD came loose, rattling around still attached to the spindle. The third case is just fine, with attached hinges & molded spindle.

Personally, before now Ive never owned this collection. But Ive rented it through Netflix, and though the artistic image adorning each DVD is now just simple grey, the content is laid out identical fashion to those older original Netflix discs. Now that Ive watched a few discs I definitely believe this to be more of a repackaging rather than a refurbishing when it comes to audio/visual quality. Here is some more information taken straight off the packaging.

Disclaimer: I was a youngster when the first season of Star Trek hit the boob tube back in the midsixties. I often joke with people that all you need to know about life can be learned from viewing Star Trek.

2121921,5,B0002V7TNI,"I read a few of the other reviews here before posting mine. I have to say, I don't really see what all the complaints are about. Yes, this is in the original aspect ratio. If you take 10 minutes to research the product before purchasing it, you would find out that there is very little they can do to enhance this series for newer players and HD TVS. Voyager and DS9 was the first of the Star Treks to use CGI instead of models and camera tricks for a lot of the scenes. This causes an issue when trying to up convert the series to HD because if they do, they will need to reinvest a million dollars into recreating the CG shots and even a lot of the backgrounds.  The Next Generation was easier for them and less costly because they didn't really use CGI.  This being said, this re-release is great in my opinion. I bought all of Voyager a few years back and just a few months ago I picked up the new re-release of TNG and TOS in the box sets. I had wanted DS9 for a long time but most of the complete collections were expensive and some reviews said that the discs were printed in China and unreadable. I did not want to pay 300 bucks for something that didn't work. That being said, this collection was a bargain for under 100 bucks. Yes, some of the first seasons don't look great on HD tv but as a Trek fan, I can live with it.  I love having it in my collection.

I will state that the same disc in other reviews that is loose, season 6's final disc, was loose for me as well but still playable.  Hopefully they will work on that issue for others. (I'm sure it comes lose during shipping most times.) All in all, great purchase and great addition to my collection.

EDIT. I received a replacement copy today. This time there were two loose disks but neither were scratched. As far as the series goes, the quality of the first season is really not that good, but far from a horrible deal breaker. The quality is much better in the later seasons, which were the ones I initially tried with the previous copy. The packaging is still terrible with the disks far too tight.

2122104,5,B0002V7TNI,"Look, DS9 is one of the best series ever made and is very influential on the way stories are presented in TV shows today, so the show gets 5 stars.
But this pricing gets 1 star.  600 dollars...what madness is this?
It was bad enough shelling out 50 bucks per season, but I did that because there was no choice at the time.  That was 350.00 and over the course of several years at least to soften the blow.
Now, with the series doing really well in Netflix views and is also on hulu and Amazon video, there are more choices available to watch DS9 than ever before. So why the extortionate dvd pricing?  Because people are apparently paying that price. That's how this works.
My recommendation is to make the extra effort to get the individual season sets and pay less.

Now more about the actual disc sets:  I do have all of these and it could use some cleaning up for newer tvs.  A ""remaster"" is deserved.
The packaging is pretty clumsy, as are most of the CBS/Paramount products. Expect the folding plastic covers to wear away and break after a year or two.  The plastic trays that hold the discs are prone to cracking and the sharp edges can scratch the discs, so watch out for that too.
I hope for another attempt at a disc set because this series above all others deserves royal treatment, but I am expecting to rely more on watching it on a streaming service going forward.",1448064000,5,1378,4.3803921568627455

2122170,5,B0002V7TNI,"FIRST THE STAR TREK FRANCHISE :
As I was packing away my collection of over 2 thousand disks (dvd) I came across many which I knew I would want to watch again. Especially the shows which I considered groundbreaking for the times. Almost all my dvds were individual movies or tv shows . I thought how nice it would be to see the many episodes of series which I  liked for many reasons but missed for one reason or the other. Since STAR TREK the original series gave me much pleasure and stimulated my imagination in my youth I thought I would begin there. This led me to TNG then Voyager and finally in 2012 bought DS9. These were happy moments reliving as well as watching episodes that were missed the first time around. The difference this time was how these shows were not just fun scifi to watch but had something to say to me about the world we live in. They had an additional agenda. They entertained as well as gave me some thought provoking moments.
DS9:
OF all the different series in the franchise DS9 was the show that held for me important ideas which seemed (and are) so very important. The need for forgiveness and acceptance for past enemies. There seemed to be a theological theme running through the entire run . I am not especially (or was) a person looking for answers but always felt there was more going on and it was up to me to find it. Kind of heavy for a scifi tv show.
And of course there was much humor. Many episodes dealt with parenting and love of family its weaknesses and strengths. Not bad for scifi.
Of all the different shows DS9 was the least gimmicky in turns of objects from the future. The show held its own with great acting ,serious topics and the thread of important social issues running through each episode.
This is the star trek franchise that should not be missed.",1442361600,20,1811,4.405970149253731

2122173,5,B0002V7TNI,"I have just finished the final season of DS9.  What a series!  What a finish!  Everyone involved in the production of this series made it the best Star Trek ever.  Still, I cannot remember ever wishing a series did not end more than this one.  Watching the series has been a wonderful experience, one I hope to repeat someday.  Some have described DS9 as more character driven that its predecessors.  I would have to agree.  But they are great characters.  And yet there is no want for action, particularly in the later years covering the war.  Although, I would have liked the DS9 series to have continued, the producers were probably correct to end it the way they did.  I have seen some series that went on too long, running out of good stories and allowed their characters to deteriorate.  I think DS9 certainly ended on a high note (or should I say a tenor note with credit to Vic Fontaine and The Way You Look Tonight).",1433116800,3,925,4.473053892215569

2122175,3,B0002V7TNI,"Did you know war is hell and different groups of people don't always get along?  If not, DS9 can really teach you something. Do you like Star Trek, but want there to be less exploration, less new ideas, creatures and places?  Do you want more romance, evil conspiracy and bureaucracy? Would you prefer Star Trek to have a lot less science fiction and a lot more serialized drama? Than DS9 will be for you.

Others say that it has sophistication because it is not afraid to get dark because dark = better. By doing so it becomes like any other drama, albeit with the consequences to the characters usually only lasting one episode or returning when convenient to the plot.  Taken for what it is, it might average out to be on par with others of the ST series as its bad episodes are not nearly as bad as OS or NG. However, you might remember a line, a relationship or a moment, but there are only a few standout, start-to-finish, great episodes. I know that it is serialized when the others were not, but it is a lot harder to make a point when you have to write a teleplay rather than have a whole season to present something. There is a lot of completely meaningless padding in DS9.  As a result, there is far higher of a margin of error so it just stayed on the good-very good course for its whole run, without taking any real risks because it didn't have to. It worked within a tried-and-true TV drama formula (add 1 part space, 1 part aliens, and 1 part mysticism) . By turning it into a soap opera/war drama that happens to take place in space, it becomes a lot easier to write but loses many of the elements that make Star Trek transcendental and becomes like something we have seen many times before.

SPOILER:
There is an intergalactic war in which billions of people die--except any main characters. So novel. So dark. So subversive.",1432166400,,1842,4.4188790560471976

2122211,2,B0002V7TNI,"I'm not really a big fan of sci-fi, but since my childhood I felt that Gene Roddenberry was a rare genius for giving us Star Trek: The Next Generation. I'll also come right out and argue that there is no finer Star Trek captain than Jean-Luc Picard - portrayed by the inimitable Patrick Stewart, whose talent is indisputable and truly shines in TNG.

So I was truly saddened and disappointed by DSN, which I feel suffers from a combination of poor casting and sub-par plot lines - some episodes are fantastic, only to be followed by several that leave you wondering why anyone bothered to show up for work after reading the script. Nana Visitor, in particular, is a terribly poor actress - at least in this series - with absolutely NO range and, worst of all, zero ability to commit to and display true emotions. Every time she's supposed to be upset or crying, watching her unbelievably bad acting is just painful. Even Avery Brooks as the central character, station commander Benjamin Sisko, overacts most of the time and fails to deliver a believable portrayal of...well, anything really. It seems rather strange that the best acting is delivered by the supporting cast - especially by Marc Alaimo as the villain you love to hate, Gul Dukat; and Andrew Robinson as the cryptic and exiled former member of the Obsidian Order, Garak.

While I'm no expert on sci-fi as a genre or Gene Roddenberry in particular, I found this entire series to be lacking the je-ne-sais-quoi that made TNG so fantastic. This series relies just ambles all over the spectrum without giving any kind of consistence, so that it fails to engage the viewer with the individual characters and the storyline on the whole - if you can even say that there is one. The show started two years after Gene Roddenberry's death, and while it's obviously pure speculation on my part, it seems to me that his style was abandoned in this series.",1423785600,,1907,4.706586826347305
2122212,5,B0002V7TNI,"Friendship.  That's the word I would use to describe the series from start to end; in all shades and forms.  Unlike all the other Star Trek series where the characters are all just noble and natural coalesce around each other this one has realistic push and pull. Friendships take time to build however and as someone from an actual military background the inter-workings of personal dynamics make the series worthwhile.

Some of these characters do not get along and in fact never like each other.  Quark and Kira feud the entire series and realistically so, they have different value systems, beliefs and goals that will never quite see eye to eye.  Even after saving each others lives a couple times (out of mutual purpose or duty) you see them more friendly for a couple episodes then back to arguing.  O'Brien and Bashir form the series tightest bond after initially finding each other annoying.  A young idealistic doctor and a battle hardened noncommissioned officer make the best series odd couple.  They don't become friends though until the doctor grows up a little bit and O'Brien, beset by an unhappy wife and family responsibilities, rediscovers a little bit of the kid in him. It doesn't happen overnight and literally takes seasons to full develop. Rom and his brother Quark cannot be more different and Rom's son Nog grows up with the best qualities of both and his close friend Jake Sisko.  Odo, ever the dogged investigator who sees the world in black and white struggles to work with a crew that sees the world in plenty of grey shades but eventually finds the courage to reveal and pursue his crush on Kira.  All of this set against the backdrop of a world recently freed from a military occupation; the one time buddhist-esque peace lovers forced to face hard realities attempt to rediscover their compassion while never again allowing themselves to fall under the thumb of an oppressor.

If you want the constant exploration of the original Star Trek series with its Roddenberry inspired optimistic view of humanity this may not be for you.  If you like characters who have to find a way to work with each other despite differences in order to achieve shared goals and overcome adversaries; this is a perfect series Trek fan or no.",1423612800,30,2253,4.808290155440415

Religion, politics, ethics, family, and friendship--these are values and issues that we deal with every day in our own lives, and it's what makes DS9 such an amazing drama.  If you're looking for escapist entertainment, DS9 is not the Trek for you.  But if you want a show that is mature, intellectual, and doesn't hit the ""reset"" button at the end of the episode... well then, Deep Space Nine was made for you.

*You should watch The Next Generation, though, just for the needed background on Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, and the like... just expect a lot fewer episodes worthy of a five-star rating.

2122348,5,B0002V7TNI,"What I like is the depth that this series goes compared to TNG where most episodes are stand alones, there are various story lines running parallel and over multiple episodes and seasons. This is great for a dvd-set as you can watch it as much as you want but it may be hard to follow if it's just a once a week episode on tv.

I bought the dvd-set ""used"", all the discs were in great shape, just the plastic case of season 7 was cracked and plastic pieces fell all over when opening for the first time, But since it's all about the discs it was well worth the discount of getting it used.

As for ranking the various Star Trek series, I have seen Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise and I love them all. The best aspects of Star Trek is the philosophical, political and social depth of it in questions, problems and stories. I love it when it makes me reflect on the same kind of situation in this day and age on earth. I don't know if this has been designed by writers to be so in depth or just happened but I love it.",1402099200,,1041,4.148514851485149

2122350,4,B0002V7TNI,"The show itself very good. The first two seasons are little slow and more episodic. After that story arcs happen which makes for a very compelling show. Definitely best trek compared to all others. I give the show itself 5 stars.

1/2 star taken off due to a pretty bad menu interface. I don't mind the Cardassian graphics, it's just that trying to cycle through back to back episodes or cycling through special features is slow and clunky. Basically the design was bad.

1/2 star taken off for the cheap DVD cases too. When the book of DVDs is enclosed in the flimsy sleeve, it's fine, all the DVDs are snugly in place. The problem is the book of DVDs when you take it out of the sleeve. The pages (hard plastic DVD holders) are stacked on top of each other, then were literally scotch taped together on the left side to make a seam, so you can flip through the DVDs. Already one page of the season one book came loose. I guess on the bright side I can easily repair it with more scotch tape, but I really shouldn't have to do that. The other minor aggravation with these books of DVDs is that you to open two front flaps, one to the left and one right. I'm having to use the backs of my hands to keep the covers out of my way while trying to flip to the DVD I'm to get at.

2122352,3,B0002V7TNI,"First let me say that the series is good.  Different than TNG and Voyager in that it's a space station and deals with the perils of space station permenance.  I enjoy this series in a different way.  TNG and Voyager are easier to watch because they are self contained episodes and missing one or 2 (or skipping ones I don't enjoy) really does not effect the overall viewing.  This series relies a little more on season long (series long?) themes.  Missing an episode or 2 can really mess up your overall understanding.  So as a series it is a 4 star (For me Voyager was the best, followed by DS9 and TNG then the original- I never got into Enterprise).  SO why the 3 stars?  PARAMOUNT!!!! What a lousy job they did with these DVDs.  I mean the picture is not the clearest (almost like the tracking was slightly off).  The menu interface is horrible (yea I felt like I was actually trying to learn a Cardassian computer system), and the overall packaging is the absolute worst thing I have ever seen.  Even my $.99 Walmart specail DVDs come in better packaging than these.  No way these DVDs are going to stay safe.  I'm building a storage crate just for this series in the hopes that I can minimize the wear and tear these containers will see.  I would be so mad if I had only paid $50 to $70 dollars for the series- but at (currently) almost TWO HUNDRED BUCKS- dang it I expect something other than a flimsy plastic wrap around sleeve and a super super cheap multi case dvd holder.  Ugggh Paramount you so cheapen your wears.  I guess the only thing worse than this would have been bootlegged copies in Chinese- but the cases probably still would have been better (and possibly the picture quality).  So 4 stars for the series- 1 Star for the quality- and 5 stars for the merchant who shipped this very fast, and securly, and was $10 bucks cheaper!",1395619200,3,1849,4.423076923076923

Similar to Babylon 5, Stargate SG-1, and Red Dwarf, it includes several long story arcs that extend through the entire series, with extensive character development and evolution. The setting and the characters grow dramatically, but remain consistent to their personalities and loyalties (rather than the spontaneous, incoherent, and jarring changes seen in some science fiction television series), without proselytizing.
It presents several points of view, including several from outside the federation, exploring their culture and behavior rather than using aliens only as comic relief or faceless enemies.

It has the most action, the best special effects, the most intense drama, the most memorable recurring characters, and the most detailed stories. Individual DS9 episodes, like ""Duet,"" ""The Maquis,"" ""The Wire,"" ""Homefront,"" ""Paradise Lost,"" and ""Waltz"" are among the best Trek ever filmed. And yet, it was really DS9, not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyager/dp/B00062IDDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyager</a>, that killed the franchise. As much as I loathe J.J. Abrams' take on Trek, old Gene Roddenberry's vision perished a decade earlier.

The main storyline of the show is the Dominion War, spanning multiple seasons. This arc led to a few excellent individual episodes, but as a concept, it was dismally weak. For all that the show was said to bring a more modern, morally fractured worldview to Trek, the Dominion War was really pandering to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tolkienist/dp/0544003411/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tolkienist</a>&nbsp;interpretation of history, in which the good elves fight the evil orcs and never have to think too hard about it.

The show started with the Cardassians, possibly the greatest of the villainous Trek races. They were intelligent, dangerous 20th-century nationalists, eloquent sophists with philosophical arguments supporting their way of life, efficient soldiers whose loyalty to their families was as great as their devotion to their totalitarian state. They were scary, formidable opponents. Over seven seasons, however, the show transitioned to the Dominion, an evil empire populated entirely by comic-book villains. No sentient individual could possibly make a conscious choice to support or join these people, and indeed, none ever did: all of their soldiers and bureaucrats were cloned or grown in vats, genetically engineered to be loyal. Among other things, this made it impossible to feel the least bit of respect or compassion for them. They made perfect cannon fodder for action sequences.

The other major theme of the show was the plight of the Bajoran people and their effort to recover from years of Cardassian occupation. The show's portrayal of the Bajorans was straight-up Victorian&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orientalism/dp/039474067X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orientalism</a>, with a liberal veneer for the Clinton years. On one hand, the Bajorans were unambiguously good and enjoyed full moral indulgence from the writers. Individual Bajorans would frequently express regret for ""doing some things during the occupation,"" but the show never took them to task for it, and those ""things"" were rarely dramatized or elaborated on. But Bajorans couldn't even be culpable for helping the Cardassians. When Kira learns that her own mother collaborated (sort of) with the occupiers, at first she's angry, but inevitably progresses to forgiveness.

That's all fine. After all, it was impossible not to sympathize with the Bajorans, since the writers had the Cardassians commit literally every single crime ever found in human history: concentration camps from the Nazis, comfort women from Imperial Japan, slavery, forced labour, show trials, and so on. But as much as the show was on the Bajorans' side, it still didn't trust them to run their own planet. This began with the very first episode, in which it is revealed that the gods of the ancient Bajoran religion exist inside a wormhole, but that these gods have no wish to directly talk to the Bajorans, and have instead appointed a human Starfleet officer as their Emissary.

I couldn't have thought of a more condescending symbol if I'd tried. A whole planet worships these beings and prays to them for deliverance, but the jerks don't even acknowledge the people they're protecting, and decide their fate together with a foreign soldier. This inadvertently reflected the writers' own attitude -- throughout the show, the Bajorans were objects of interstellar politics, not subjects. They were allowed to be sympathetic, but only in a secondary role, as objects of the Federation's benevolence. In the second season, the writers briefly toyed with the idea of a Bajoran nationalist movement (""The Circle"") that wants to expel the Federation and govern independently. This would have led to interesting gray areas, so naturally, the writers discredited the movement by revealing that the Cardassians had sponsored it.

But then, the show was condescending to everyone. The Klingons became fantastically incompetent, even more than on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TNG/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TNG</a>, so much that even Worf was forced to admit (""Tacking Into The Wind"") that his culture was hopelessly backward. Even the sneaky Romulans were no match for Ronald D. Moore and the power of the Federation (""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges""). And, while the Cardassians were evil, it was perfectly OK to use Garak's skills as a spy and assassin to achieve the Federation's goals, while still looking down on him for being a savage Cardassian, of course (""In The Pale Moonlight"").

The philosophical core of DS9 is Ronald D. Moore's fascination with the idea of using unlimited state power to do good and bring about World Peace. To be fair, in ""Paradise Lost"" (one of the show's best episodes, and a highlight for Trek as a whole) he has Sisko uncover a conspiracy by Federation hard-liners to stage a military coup. But in seasons six and seven, there doesn't seem to be a problem with Federation flag officers outsourcing government policy to a rogue intelligence unit. Perhaps the problem with the hard-liners was that they simply didn't follow the proper procedures.

This could be great drama, and often was, but there was little room in it for Star Trek. Compare it with TNG, where Picard could intellectually respect Klingon culture while distancing himself from it, and demonstrated considerable moral rigour in the face of witch hunts or political conflicts. The one thing missing from DS9 was Picard's sense of responsibility.",1377388800,8,6379,5.8076923076923075

2122438,5,B0002V7TNI,"It was no mistake or coincidence that Deep Space Nine was presented as a 'grand central station', a terminus to the stars.  It had more speaking roles for characters than the other shows, combined.  It grew from what was a glorified shopping mall in the sky to a stationary ship of war.

The series began as a claustrophobic little show with characters whose problems were presumably 'space related' but could occur anywhere to anyone.

The producers then began evolving the show.  The Dominion War began with some fascinating dramas with men in combat, couples and families torn asunder, and character(honesty) challenged.

The original ensemble cast included a dishonest Ferengi(is that redundant?) club owner, the station chief and his son, the security chief, and an assorted cast of underlings.  Not that fascinating...

Ah, but added to this mix eventually was a renegade tailor/assassin with enough angst for a small city; Worf from the Next Generation; a complete cast of characters playing the Dominion(the ultimate enemy of semi-corporeal beings); a sinister injection of questionable agents from the Federation itself; away missions; visitors guilty of a holocaust, grand theft, political intrigue, etc etc.  From the ridiculous (a Ferengi 'rescue team' sent to save a hostage) to the sublime (the marriage of Worf and Dax and even more evocative, the growing relationship of the station's chief and his son).  The show didn't miss a trick, even including one of the initial, and hottest, female-to-female kisses ever broadcast...

The show covers it all, life and death, peace and war, boom and bust.  It's actually a lot of work keeping up with characters, locations, and continuing plotlines.

2122481,4,B0002V7TNI,"I love Star Trek. This is has all the seasons, plus extra bonus material on the last disc of each season. I would recommend waiting until after you see all the episodes before watching the extras because a lot of them are character dossiers, which include interviews with various actors and actresses, but they discuss the character throughout the entire series: how he/she changed, grew, evolved. So the season 1 character dossier will talk about what happened with the character in later seasons.

If you're already very well acquainted with the series and all the episodes, then no problem. However, if you want to take the series episode by episode because you don't have a photographic memory, then I suggest waiting and watch the extra bonus material after you finish the entire series.

One more thing: there is a piece of paper that covers the back of each season, wraps around the bottom, and comes up just a little in the front. This piece of paper is held on by that clear glue that easily peels off. Meaning: that paper will very quickly either fall off, get turned...in short, it will become an annoyance.

2122513,5,B0002V7TNI,"I grew up on the second generation of Trek series (TNG, DS9, VOY) in the 1990s. All were interesting and had their strong points as well as their weak points. However, the one that stands out as the strongest was Deep Space Nine. Rather than retread the mindless idealism and admittedly absurd plots of the original series, Deep Space Nine added a much needed dose of political realism to the Star Trek universe. In many ways Deep Space Nine built on storylines and characters established by its more idealistic predecessor The Next Generation, but gave them a more morally complex spin.
Deep Space Nine (from its third season onward) is the first show in the Trek universe that should be introduced to a general audience (whereas Enterprise should be kept away from non-geeks at all costs, lest they shirk Star Trek forever). Deep Space Nine is (for the most part) devoid of the preachiness and impractical ideologies that define major characters' actions in TNG and TOS. In addition to the elements of political realism and somewhat grimmer outlook on life presented in Deep Space Nine, there is a strong element of fantasy in the series, which may alienate fans of straight science fiction. However, this is used to explore themes of religion in depth. Fans of cultural anthropology (as well as those who tend to think deeply about spiritual matters) may appreciate this aspect of Deep Space Nine (it also has an added awesome factor for being the only Star Trek series whose captain is qualified to speak on behalf pf a higer power). Additionally, Deep Sace Nine provides an engaging multi-episode story arc in the form of the Dominion War storyline that defines the second half of the season (which lends the series some of its more interesting recurring characters such as Weyoun and Sloan, each of whom are quite intimidating when they appear on screen. Every time these characters show up, the audience is left wondering just what will happen next).
It is not hard to see where Deep Space Nine may alienate some more traditional Trek viewers. In many ways the themes explored seem like they would be fitting for a setting like that of Dune or Game of Thrones, rather than to a world based on Rodenberry's vision of peacemaking and exploration as well as a thinly disguised take on the Liberal school of international relations theory. However, this is where Deep Sace Nine's strength lies. Rather than being a black and white tale of advanced, enlightened humans debating whether or not to interfere with more primitive civilizations, Deep Space Nine pits two complex sides against each other, making for a story rife with suspense and intrigue, led by a strong main cast that includes interesting, multi-layered characters dealing with complicated issues that are quite relevant in our current world.",1355616000,2,2809,4.928270042194093

2122539,5,B0002V7TNI,"My personal favorite of all of the series, and the ""Star Trek"" that I feel has aged the best outside of the original, Sixties-era show.

Though I will always have a soft spot for TNG - it's the first ""Trek"" that I ever watched regularly, and the first show I ever really loved - some of that series' stories played it a little too safe; also, TNG's early years haven't aged well at all from a visual or acting standpoint (though hopefully TNG's upcoming Blu Ray release may fix some of that). DS9, however, seemed to benefit both from a decent budget and from the writing lessons learned on TNG: stories here are riskier and more complex than in any other Star Trek, and the characters are fully fleshed out and human. They're all the more interesting because they are not the idealized versions of people that TNG too often presented. And, unlike ""Voyager"" and (especially) ""Enterprise,"" the episodes and ideas presented still feel fresh and interesting.

*I do have one note specific to the product, rather than the episodes themselves: As has been noted in reviews of other Star Trek series releases, Paramount's pricing plan for seasons of ""Star Trek"" is ridiculously expensive.

 ... das, wenn man geschickt recherchiert (und einem bekannt ist, das ""lnderbergreifende"" Auflagen meitens immer denselben Hersteller haben), man im europischen Ausland gnstiger kauft.

Da ich genau wie die meiten hier immer noch warte, ob endlich mal der Preis in Deutschland dafr unter die 100 Euro - Marke fllt, habe ich eben zusammengerechnet, was alle Staffeln hier (Slimline Edition, Seasons 1-7, deutsche Tonspur !) einzeln in UK kosten wrden. Und was kommt raus !?

Wrden sie heute bestellen, wren es z. B. in UK 74,93 Pfund Sterling, - macht laut aktuellen Wechselkurs gerade 85,95 Euro.

Ansonsten gibt es hier absolut nichts zu beanstanden, - Deep Space Nine ist wohl die beste Serie aus dem ganzen Star Trek Universum. Allein schon die deutliche Nhe zu Babylon 5, von der gewaltigen, spter (ab Staffel 3) episodenbergreifenden, epischen Geschichte bleibt einzigartig.

Wie bei Babylon 5 dienten die ersten beiden Staffeln also mehr dazu, um smtliche, einzelnen Charaktere erstmal beim Fan einzufhren.

Okay, nun dichte ich gerade der Serie zuviel gutes an ;-)

In Wahrheit verhielt es sich schon eher so, das man zunchst einmal nicht wute, wird das Projekt bei den Fans angenommen. Man wollte sich eben ein wenig absichern, dh. wre die Serie vorzeitig wieder abgesetzt worden. Daher entschloss man sich am Anfang, fast alle Episoden fr sich abschlieen zu lassen.

Nach dem trotzdem furiosen Start ... und sptestens, als das Thema immer mehr in Richtung groer Konflikt mit den Grndern bzw. das ""Dominion"" gegen die Fderation ging, wurde es aber immer besser.

Ich habe selten (wie gesagt, hchstens nur im Vergleich noch bei Babylon 5) dermaen vielschichtige Personen gesehen wie in dieser Serie, dagegen kommt ein Jean Luc Picard nicht an.

Auch eine Kathryn Janeway hat mich da weniger begeistern knnen, ebenso berhaupt alles von TNG (davor) bzw. VOYAGER (danach) ...

 ... was hier passiert, ist, das mit dem davor schon beinahe Star Trek blichen - und inzwischen echt langweiligen Schema von ""schwarz und wei"" radikal aufgebrochen wurde. Kaum einer ist hier eindeutig gut bzw. schlecht, - alles hat Grauzonen.

Sogar ein Gul Dukat - obwohl im Grunde das personifizierte bse, kann einem da zuweilen recht sympathisch werden. Und manchmal ist man sogar angewidert von den Sympathietrgern, vor allem, wenn ab,- und zu auch deren ""Leichen im Keller"" (wie z. B. Fehlentscheidungen oder moralisch fragwrdiges) bekannt werden.

Wir sehen wieder einmal mehr, das auch Science Fiction, die Zukunft, keineswegs ""perfekt"" ist. Es ist im Grunde nur eine Fortsetzung unserer heutigen Probleme. Und das macht eben das besondere an Deep Space Nine aus, es bleibt ein Spiegelbild der derzeitigen Gesellschaft.

Der Spannungsbogen baut sich immer weiter auf und dadurch ist es einfach schn, kann man dann wie hier, das ganze am Stck, - Folge fr Folge und ohne Werbeunterbrechung genieen.

Kaufempfehlung, fr die komplette Serie (DVD Auflage) !

Edit: damit war gemeint, sie bekommen deutsche Tonspur auch im Ausland, aber eben bedeutend billiger !",1328313600,,3114,5.269230769230769
2122556,5,B0002V7TNI,"When Deep Space Nine premiered in January 1993 I was a huge fan of The Next Generation.  I did watch the first season of Deep Space Nine but was not able to really get into the second season because my parents moved and the new local Fox station did not syndicate DS9 the way they did TNG.  I managed to catch a few episodes here and there over the years, but I didn't really get to watch the series in its entirety until I borrowed it from a friend a few years ago.  Many people criticized DS9 as being sub par compared to The Next Generation, Voyager, and even Enterprise.  Some complaints I heard were that the series was too dark, there was too much conflict among the core characters, the show got too bogged down into the religious aspects of the Bajoran people and the politics of the Federation/Dominion War.

I have to say all of these criticisms only gave the show strength.  These things set the series apart from it's predecessors and successors.  While I absolutely adored The Next Generation, that show's biggest weakness was its lack of character development for several of its core characters.  Writers of that series put extreme focus on the characters of Picard, Riker, Data, and Worf while largely dismissing Crusher, La Forge and Troi.  DS9 succeeded not only in fleshing out every single one of its core characters, they created and developed a slew of memorable supporting characters and succeeded in reinventing one of their key characters (Dax) for the series' final season.  The internal conflicts between the main characters work because DS9 isn't a Starfleet space station and the political and religious struggles provide layers of intrigue.

If you've never given DS9 much thought, I highly recommend it.  I'm hoping DS9 will appear on Blu-Ray next year as soon as The Next Generation's seven season run is released.",1327276800,2,1845,4.785488958990536

And then the further I got into watching the discs, the fewer of them would play.

The main characters are really strong and well developed. They forge deep friendships and even romances. The Dominion War plot allows the series to explore darker moral questions where the right answer isn't always clear. While the DS9 crew is on the ""good side,"" the show has a moral complexity not present in other Treks. However, what really makes the series for me is the recurring characters. Garak, Weyoun, Dukat, Martok, Damar, Rom, and even Kai Winn all drive the series forward and serve as great foils for the main characters (arguably, by the end of the series these characters had more screen time than some of the main characters). Overall, definitely recommended if you like Star Trek and thought-provoking morality plays.",1322870400,,902,4.788461538461538

2122576,5,B0002V7TNI,"This is not your Fathers Star Trek.  The days of James T. Kirk have grown up. Not even the Next Generation series was as brilliantly written and filmed as Deep Space Nine.  This series was a novel written for TV.  A continuous story about a new Lt Ben Sisko as the first Federation officer taking command of a large space station for the Federation Of Planets. His beginnings are shaky trying to get used to a new command and his new home, DS9, located out in deep space, very far from Earth.

Sisko soon finds his place with his staff and they slowly become more like a family in surreal surroundings.  ST:DS9 has everything that a good novel should have. Love, hate, peace, war, duty, mystery, intrigue, wonderment, quality special effects, and friendship. Over time, we see every one of these aspects. We get to know each of the perfectly casted characters as if they are our own friends, and yes, enemies. We feel their pain, and their triumphs. In essence, Deep Space Nine becomes home, and the casts are our neighbors and friends who we care about.

This series is not a video game designed around the special effects. Although there will be some good action and adventure, it is not the constant action adventure of the other Star Trek series. DS9 is a darker story about the characters and their lives. It is about the loyalty of duty and friends. It is about freedom and patriotism. It's about families. It is about many alien races working together, fighting in a common cause for the benefit of everyone.  This series had a good budget which shows in the quality of the scripts, lavish sets, and very good special effects.

Before the series ends, you will have laughed, cried, jumped for joy in victories, sat on the edge of your seat many times, and pounded your fist in hate and frustration for the bad guys. You can't help yourself. The stories draw you in like a dream you don't want to wake up from, just so you don't miss anything.  My only regret at the end was that it ended. But as they say, all good things must come to an end.  Deep Space Nine is for the true trekkie at heart that loves everything about the Star Trek universe. If that describes you, then DS9 will not disappoint you.  I have watched this series in TV reruns maybe 5 or 6 times, and yet I just purchased the series on DVD. Am I crazy? Maybe a little, but I like to look at myself as a true fan, and a dreamer.

UPDATE: Bad but a happy ending.....

Most of the discs had problems with skipping, freeze frames, and many episodes would not finish playing near the end. I returned the set to the seller and got a refund. Then, I repurchased the series from an different seller, and found the same flaws in exactly the same time marks on the same disc number and episodes. I just returned the new set for another refund.

Then I purchased the series direct from Amazon on sale. When I got the replacement, I noticed it was packaged differently.  And every episode was much higher quality and without defects of any kind.  Then it dawned on me that the packages I got from other dealers were either poor illegal copies, or much older repackaged defective packs being sold cheaper.  Either way, be aware of this.  Alawys buy directly from Amazon or only sellers that are fullfilled by Amazon.  Many sellers get illegal copies packaged to look like the real thing, but they are not.  But Amazon direct sales are always the real thing.",1309305600,5,3417,4.480645161290322

2122598,5,B0002V7TNI,"When I first heard about DS9, I was one of the doubters. Star Trek stuck in one place? On a space station? Couldn't that get old in a hurry?

Well, it didn't. The creators and writers knew what they were doing. Once again the cast and characters were diverse and interesting, and DS9 became the first full fledged ""continuing series"" in the Star Trek canon. Political intrigue, spies and counter-spies, rebel Maquis, and troubles aplenty from the far side of the wormhole combined to keep the series not only fresh, but also inventive.

Sisko made an excellent commander, and one with many facets. O'Brien and Worf helped tie the series into TNG and draw in otherwise reluctant fans. The multi-lived Dax was a brilliant concept, and I never stopped being amused with Sisko calling the young and beautiful Jadzia ""old man"". Odo at the start seemed to be a gimmick, but soon was a rich character with his own set of problems and goals. Dr. Bashir had an innocent charm, even through his tendency to be a ""wolf"". LOL Quark and the Rules of Acquisition always hit the spot with some comic relief. Major Kira is probably a tie with Katherine Janeway as the female officer you most want to stay on the good side of.

By the end, I found that I missed this show the most when it was retired. The officers and residents of DS9 came to feel like family, and its a bit sad to have no new stories of how things turned out.

The DVD set itself is magnificent. The presentation on these DVDs is, I believe, far superior to what I saw when the shows originally aired. The sound is solid. Even the menus are visually exciting.

As other reviewers have noted, beware of cheap imports on the secondary market. This is a problem for all three 7 year Star Trek sets. Just remember the old adage that if the price looks too good to be true, it probably is. I searched out Amazon and eBay for quite some time until I learned to recognize the tell tale signs of the cheap bootlegs. In the end, I delayed long enough on all of the series that the regular Amazon price dropped to acceptable levels. I wound up making all the Star Trek series purchases directly from Amazon as a result. I got the correct products. They are excellent in quality, so I'm very glad I wound up making the purchases in that way.",1293494400,4,2282,4.436754176610979
2122599,4,B0002V7TNI,"Well, I love DS9.  I'll just get that out there, but now to the boxed set...  My wife bought me this boxed set as one of my birthday gifts.  Initially I was thrilled, but that feeling quickly left after examining it.  Even though it was shrink wrapped, one of the seasons was facing in the opposite direction.  After opening each season, they all felt really cheap and fell apart immediately.  Also, on the back of each season, by the Paramount seal, Star Trek was misspelled Satr Trek.  I'm telling you guys, if your set looks like this, and you bought it 'new' from the marketplace, you just purchased  counterfeit goods, my friends!  I knew it the second I looked at it.  She was just trying to get the best deal and saw a 'new' sealed set on Marketplace for roughly 1/3 off the Amazon price and made a rational economic decision.  I am furious, though, that people are using the marketplace for these goods.  Paramount doesn't always put love into their packaging, but it would never be this bad.  Short story:  we returned the product, got our money back, ordered from Amazon.

After receiving the 'real' product from Amazon, I can say that you will know yours is real because the colors on the plastic are vibrant and quite visible, the Paramount seal is easy to make out clearly, and Star Trek is spelled correctly.  It will look very much like the picture on this page.

The knock-offs are getting good, but if it doesn't feel right and things are not spelled correctly, just send it back - or better yet, buy from Amazon directly.  It is easily worth the extra money to get the real thing, and I am very pleased with it.  Hope this helps someone.",1291161600,15,1655,4.493288590604027

Re-discovering all things wormhole with sides of Cardassian, Bajoran, Jem'hadar, Founder, Romulan and all the things that Star Trek brought is a real treat.

Also I tend to set my dvd series to 'play all episodes' and level them running in the back ground while I work but who ever designed the dvd menus for this series left out that option, you have to start EVERY episode individually, which can be a pain but like I said this is still a little nit picky.

2122602,3,B0002V7TNI,"Since I had no problems with the Chosen Collection bootleg I purchased this review will be about the show itself and not the product.  Unlike the previous Star Trek shows this one happens aboard a space station and appears to be more soap opera than action.

Oddly the show should be action packed because it teases you with Political elements and WAR.  However, many times the show goes into exploring all the characters way too much.  Even Leeta (who is a casino worker ""Dabo Girl"" at a space bar ""Quarks"") has an episode or two dedicated to her lifestyle, although she rarely is seen any other time on the show.

On a positive note: the episodes relating directly to War, Politics, and Religion are some of the best Star Trek episodes ever made.  If they had stayed within the original set guidelines and kept producing more stories relating to the actual plight of the Bajorins and the evil surrounding the Cardassins, Jem'Hadar, and the founders, this series could have been the best of all the Star Treks (which may be why some people consider it the best Star Trek Series ever).  That is why it still receives 3 stars although it is actually closer to 3 1/2 stars from me.

2122606,5,B0002V7TNI,"Although I am sure there are those who will disagree, DS9 represents the best of Trek.  True, it is darker and not as rosy/hopeful as the Next Generation, and it does not resolve itself as neatly and happily as Voyager.  I grew up on the original show, and loved it.

DS9 started out shaky the first few seasons.  I don't think the writers were sure what to do with it.  They had the space station idea down (as opposed to the show being based on a ship) but weren't sure what else.  In the bonus features, you can hear the writers talk about how they didn't get the Emissary concept at first, but ended up being glad they put it in there.  Basically this show deals with religion, politics, war, and the concept of pre-destiny.  It works in a wide arc, but brings things together in a conclusion in which not all the characters survive--in that sense, it is more ""real"" than the other versions of Star Trek, where everyone is generally happy and content and things usually seem to work out fine in the end.
Although there are episodes here and there which fall short, it is worth making the journey through the entire series.  Other reviews may focus on specific episodes, and there are several excellent ones, but this is about the series as a whole.  As with all Treks, this one is character driven, and all the major characters take interesting journeys during the 7 year run of the series.

I was not sure when the show's 4th season first premiered that adding Worf to the cast at the end of the Next Generation's run was a smart move (it seemed like a desperate move at the time) but it turned out to be brilliant, because it allowed us to delve more deeply into the world of the Klingons, how they view conflict, and how they achieve honor.  The interaction of the cultures - the artistic, religious (and persecuted) Bajorans...the political, calculating Cardassians...The aggressive and honorable Klingons...the greedy Ferengi...the secretive and isolated Romulans...and the (not so) innocent Federation (thanks to Section 31) - makes for TV that does more than entertain.  It elevates.

If you like this show, and you have not seen the new version of Battlestar Galactica, you should.  It was created by some of the same people, and takes some of these same concepts to an even higher place.  I like shows that make you think as well as entertain you.  DS9 will certainly make you rethink what you think you know about the Star Trek universe.",1265068800,3,2451,4.6235565819861435
2122607,5,B0002V7TNI,"Why precisely was DS9 the finest of the STAR TREK series?  It had a very good cast, though not clearly the best of the various series in the franchise.  Deep Space 9, the space station, was not especially compelling nor were the sets much different than other shows.  I think the reason it easily surpassed the other shows in quality was the political premise of the show and the way they stuck with that from beginning to end.  While Cardassians, Romulans, and Klingons appeared on other series, only DS9 fully exploited the potential of their struggles with one another.  The introduction of the Bajorans, the Jem'Hadar, the Dominion, and the Breen gave the series a complexity that none of the other series even remotely approached.  Long story arcs always give series more depth and focus, and this was one of the great limiting factors in the other series, all of which relied on standalone formats without any real overarching story, even VOYAGER, which had a long story arc built into its very structure, that it failed to embrace.

While the main cast was not clearly better than other STAR TREK series, the cast of recurring characters were far and away to best.  Garak, Gul Dukat, Rom, Nog, Martak, Keiko, Leeta, Zek the Grand Nagus, Weyoun and Brunt (both played by Jeffrey Combs), Damar, Vic Fontaine, and many others gave the show a marvelous depth and diversity.  Oh, and we can't forget Morn, perhaps the most famous TV character never to have uttered a single word of dialogue.  The show also does the best job of the various TREKs of fully exploiting the contrasting cultures of the various races.  I never really came to like the Klingons in any of the series and DS9 shows it as a rather foolish culture, with hints that they were on the verge of collapse and change.  I was slow to like the Ferengi, but I came to enjoy the absurd light they are used to place hyper free market capitalists in our own society (sort of Milton Friedman taken to his logical extreme).

Although DS9 depended upon a mythology developed in the original series and refined in THE NEXT GENERATION, the series actually resembles BABYLON 5 more than those shows.  Both were set in space stations built beside wormholes.  Both dealt with ongoing political conflicts.  Both had commanders with a prophetic destiny.  Both began at roughly the same time (DS9 began in January 1993 while BABYLON 5's Season One began in 1994, but the made for TV movie that served as a back door pilot was released in Feberuary of 1993).  B5 has a substantial number of passionate fans.  I am not among them.  I have a number of problems with it, from what I believe is weaknesses in the writing deriving from a lack of a strong writing staff (J. Michael Stracyznski, though unquestionably a very good writer, simply tried to shoulder too much of he writing, despite not being very good with humor and writing somewhat stilted dialogue -- I think the show would have been stronger if he had allowed other writers to take on much of the burden, allowing him to work more on redaction) and rather extreme over acting and rather bizarre character design (I am thinking of Peter Jurasik's ridiculous hair and absurd accent).  I understand completely what aspects of B5 some find appealing, but they generally are not bothered as I am by the weaknesses of the show, or at least are able to overlook them.  DS9's overall story arc doesn't contain quite the degree of pathos of B5, what with the tragic story of Londo and the complex fate of G'Kar, but I find it overall a more consistently successful series, with fewer of the missteps that marred B5.

I have found in discussions that a surprising number of people who have watched the original series and THE NEXT GENERATION, or even VOYAGER, have not seen DEEP SPACE NINE.  Of the four major series in the franchise (I see ENTERPRISE as a rather minor offshoot of the other series), this was the least watched series despite being by far the best.  I think part of the explanation for that lies in the more involved story.  With the other three series, you could easily miss a dozen or two episodes and completely enjoy an episode, understanding every aspect of the episode.  But if you missed a dozen episodes of DS9, you would find things completely changed since the previous episode.  This reflects the ongoing evolution of the story.

Although I've seen all of the STAR TREK series at least twice all the way through, this is the one series that I would be most interested in rewatching once again.  I have to admit that all in all I'm not a huge STAR TREK fan, but I am very definitely a DS9 fan.  In my own ranking of the best SF series of all time, this is the one STAR TREK series that I would rank up with BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (which was headed by DS9 alum Ronald D. Moore), FIREFLY, and FARSCAPE.  Any serious fan of TV SF has probably seen this a couple of times already, but I think something that Nana Visitor said in the extras for the Season Seven box set is true, that people might have liked this when they first watched it, but upon rewatching it they are going to be genuinely surprised at how good it is.  And the mark of a good series is definitely that it is better the second time through.",1261180800,5,5232,4.579399141630901
2122608,5,B0002V7TNI,"The best written, the best acted, the most realistic and yet profoundly fantastic series in ALL of Star Trek. A great mix of people and aliens, plus a progressive way of telling stories--nothing is taken for granted here, and each episode is not just there to entertain you, it 's there to tell a pointed story. And the entire series was good because it allowed the galactic masses to come to YOU (DS9), as well as go to them-in the Defiant. This was the new Battlestar Galactica of it's time as far as drama went--and DS9 started that kind of raw story telling that we see all the time now. DS9 was ahead of it's time, and Gene R., although not always enjoying the concept of a long war (Dominion War), would, with all the other series going on anyways, would like the change of pace that DS9 provided--not to mention the surprising end to the deadliest war in the Milky Way. And, there's Gul Dukat. As far as Star Trek Magizine is concerned, Marc Alimo's charactor was the all time #2 best villian ever; right behind Khan. #2!! That's a good show.

All the usual conflicts are located on DS9: racism, prejudice, anger, arrogance. And they're all jammed inside wonderfully visual sci-fi settings and characters. All the genres are there, too, including romance and mystery.

From the first season to the last, the characters develop in both depth and relation to the others. Here's my favorite part of DS9: The same old racial attitudes prevail, but a couple of naive kids cross the forbidden borders to form the kind of friendship only kids can form. Nog is the Ferrengi kid, and Jake is the human kid, the son of Commander Benjamin Cisco.

2122622,4,B0002V7TNI,"Many other reviewers have raved about what a stellar series DS9 was, so I won't repeat it.  Rest assured that DS9 was the pinnacle of Star Trek storytelling.

That said, when I purchased the individual season sets (yes, I own all 7), I have been consistently disappointed with the packaging.  If you love Star Trek, DS9, or sci-fi in general, don't let the shoddy packaging stop you from enjoying this brilliant show...but be aware of what you're about to get.

The visual design of the packaging is lovely.  There are clear and colored parts of each case which nest into each other, and each season comes with a list of episodes by disc on the inside of the packaging (in addition, each disc lists its episodes on the disc label).  Each season set comes with an outer case which slides off, and an inner case which unfolds to directly hold the discs.  However, the inner case of each season is plastic, which is scored at the corners in order to be bent into a box shape.  I'm constantly paranoid that merely OPENING/UNFOLDING the case will prove too much for the bent plastic at the hinge points, and a piece of the case will snap off.  If you're not sure what I mean, think about board games (or other things) that come with plastic pieces formed in a single mold, which you then have to snap free from a central rod before using.  You know how you bend that plastic back and forth a few times, and then the piece snaps free?  Yeah, THAT'S what the corners of the outer ""box"" are like.  Hence my paranoia!

Once you gingerly unfold the inner box, the DVD's are seated in individual clear plastic trays.  The trays seem to consistently hold the DVD's firmly, one per tray, so I haven't seen any issues with DVD's falling out or scratching each other due to poorly designed packaging.  However, the ""hinge"" between each tray seems just as flimsy as the outer ""hinges"" of the box....it's either scored plastic, or possibly even some kind of tape, holding each tray to the ones on either side.  I'm just as paranoid about the trays eventually snapping free if I leaf through them too often or too hard.

I would recommend this show to ANYONE as some of the most brilliant sci-fi ever shown on television.

However, the poor quality of this product became evident as I started to watch the early discs. Several episodes skipped badly. Disc 12 was missing the inner foil layer between the clear plastic layers. Flip the disc upside down and you can see ""Star Trek Deep Space 9"" clearly through the plastic. Every time the laser got to the words, it would skip. Sometimes it was every minute but the closer the letters were, the shorter the skips. The discs were out of order in the packaging. Most, if not all, of the discs showed damage to the inner ring that sits on the DVD spindle.

This is a HUGE disappointment. I truly enjoy this show, but the shoddy quality of this package is disgusting. I've been searching for ways to contact Paramount to complain about this product but so far, I've been unable to find a way to even contact the company. This is a reprehensible way to treat customers. They should be disappointed. I feel ripped off.

2122626,5,B0002V7TNI,"I recently had a discussion about the best hour of television I have ever seen. After some consideration I had to conclude that DS9 season four's ""The Visitor"" still stands as that hour. I had to look up the episode as I had no idea what it was called or what season it was, but it stuck in my memory years after I had seen it.

I haven't seen much of season one, but I have seen most of seasons two through seven, and despite a handful of weak episodes, DS9 is easily the best science fiction television series I have ever seen. It even exceeds original Star Trek and Next Generation though I do love both of those series. It actually reminds me most of the new Battlestar Galactica, but with a sense of humor and a far richer setting. Many of the themes are identical, of course, as both shows had many of the same writers. The acting in Deep Space Nine is top notch.

For the record, The Dominion are still the best Star Trek villains. Ever.

If the box set were ony $200, I would buy it immediately, but at over $300, I'll just grab this great series on Netflix.",1244160000,2,1066,4.215686274509804
2122627,1,B0002V7TNI,"When Gene Roodenbery created the original ST, STNG and Voyager his idea was based on two priniples, his Prime Directives, so to speak.  They are:

1)  The concept of traveling (Treking)and exploring into unknown territory and, hopefully,  making friends with the new alien races found.  In the above mentioned seriess what made them engaging WAS having the ship TREK from system to system and see who lives there.

2) An optimistic outlook on the human condition.  Rodenberry believed that despite all of our flaws, we humans have the ability to be more enlighened, tolerant of our differences, less influenced by our dark side like the lust for power or greed.

STAR ""TREK"" DEEP SPACE NINE VIOLATES THESE PRINCIPLES SO EGRIGIOUSLY IT WOULD BE LAUGHABLE IF IT WEREN'T SO PATHETIC.

It should have been titled ""Star Port Deeply Dark Morons"".

Watching the series was BORING (no Treking) and DEPRESSING (will we devolve into that amount of nastiness?)  If I had to put up with one more dispute, attack or war between the Cardasains and Bejorans with the Starfleet commander helplees to end it for good, I felt like puking.  Every time ""Quark"" was on scene I felt like throwing a brick on the TV.  I LOVED to HATE the Borg, Romulans Vinidians and (in the original ST) the Klingons and other lesser known villians.  I just HATE the Ferengi.  Their completely amoral pursuit of greed is tolerable for 3 or 4 episodes but after that it is profoundly irritating.

There is a looming war threat that spans most of the seasons and finally plays out. Overall its pretty well done, and there are some great episodes. However, in my opinion the cast of main characters was not as great as the other Star Trek shows, and I just didn't enjoy the show as much as the others. It does however have a large cast of side characters, (more then any other show I can think of) that make frequent appearances throughout the span of the show.

2122645,5,B0002V7TNI,"After I watched this episode again recently, it set me thinking about a lot of things that I not only saw with this particular version of Star Trek, but science fiction as a whole. The episode 'Far Beyond the Stars' is easily the high-water mark for this entire show, despite the fact that it was completely separate from the main and ongoing story-line of the show. This episode actually stands by itself much like 'Inner Light' does with Next Generation and 'City on The Edge of Forever' with the Original Series.

The main thought, and I won't even bother to say premise, is that the ever lingering question that plagued this show and made things abrasive for many of the cast members was openly and very adroitly addressed here.

The question being: Can a show have a black Captain, or a black hero as the driving force?'

Avery Brooks as Captain Benjamin Sisko suffered under this plague the entire time that the show ran. While many think that Hollywood is colorblind, it just isn't the case. Tensions from this show probably derailed much of what was going on with Star Trek in the nineties and quite possibly damaged the franchise for a long time to come, much like a butterfly effect. I'm sure the producers would disagree. Of course they would. I'm not saying that it was the fault of Avery Brooks or because they cast a black Captian and that it was a bad idea. Not at all. On the contrary.

The executives in charge of DS9, as well as the head writers were openly hostile towards Brooks and even through the seven years the show ran, the problems continued and never seemed to fade until finally, the show ended. Star Trek lore is rife with information about the relationships between Avery Brooks, Rick Berman, Brannon Braga and Steven Behr. Let's just say it mirrors what Albert R. Broccoli once said about Sean Connery as James Bond when they were originally trying to get Carey Grant: 'He's not exactly what I was looking for'.

This episode speaks to this tension, in my opinion, more than anything. Not being a trekkie without inside knowledge doesn't diminish it either. Benjamin Sisko is 'Benny', stuck as a black science-fiction writer in 1950's America, during Jim Crow, Segregation and probably just before the bulk of the civil rights movement and dreaming of a better future for all of us, not just himself. The episode in this context is bleak and has the same sinister feeling that most of the DS9 episodes had, but deals directly with every day issues. It was a stroke of genius to have a science fiction show set 200 years in the future deal with an issue that is apparently 50 years in our past, but still relevant and eye-opening. Should this episode have won a Hugo Award? Yes. Without any doubt in the world. In 1998, when this episode and aired and would have been a contender, it never even got a mention. The Hugo in 1998 went to the film 'Contact'. Just shameful. I wonder if it had anything to do with 'a Black Captain'?

The struggle Benny is going through in this, shows the pain that all writers must endure on some level, some more than others. Charles Bukowski, suffered much like our good friend Benny and once stated: 'The Gods have really put a shield on me'. I've truncated that quote for reasons that are obvious to anyone that has read Bukowski. I fall apart every time I watch this episode because Avery Brooks depiction of the frustrated writer, caged in like a parakeet, is very true and very well-acted. It's painful to watch, not because of the intensity that he's going through on-screen, but because every word and gesture he emits is more than true. You can feel on some deeper level that you're seeing the events of perhaps thousands of peoples lives. It takes you all the way back to another question: 'Does the caged bird still sing?'

His soliloquy of 'you cannot destroy an idea' is powerful and so in the face of everybody that has never faced a day like this, a moment like this, a life like this.

I don't want to recap the entire episode as many folks have already done that. Watch the episode if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out if you haven't. If it's been awhile ... revisit it, it's honestly Star Trek's finest hour, bar none.

This episode 'Far Beyond The Stars' is from Season 6 and is Episode 13. It premiered February 11th, 1998.

But instead the whole show just ended up becoming a bad soap opera involving a few eye-candy main characters and some bizarre-looking humanoid races that are trying to dominate each other, and rather mundane silliness involving devious Ferengis and scantily clad bar ladies. The plot lines seem to have very little depth beyond this. Frankly, the aliens in most sci-fi shows like this today seem rather boring. Where are the really interesting ones, like the ""Taelons"" in ""Earth Final Conflict""? Also, I would have liked to see them make Deep Space Nine a slightly weirder place, perhaps putting in some unexplored dimensions harboring a few deep, dark secrets -- things that instill a sense of wonder and transcend the predictable. If somebody is traveling through a space wormhole, I want him to encounter something really unusual that makes the trip worthwhile. How about some interesting MONSTERS that may or may not be intelligent but look like something other than mutant humanoids? Maybe also a narrator ruminating a bit about what weird, unimaginable horrors we have to look forward to. Maybe even some tongue-in-cheek silliness too as long as it's actually funny! This was done quite well back in the 60s with shows like ""Lost in Space"", but unfortunately, today's producers rarely seem to have the imagination to come up with such material!

The problem I have is with the DVD construction.  There's no booklet in the DVDs showing an episode list and a caption on the episode and unless the opening teaser lasts at least 4 minutes, skipping to the second chapter in order to skip the credits will make you miss showtime (these two things I believe should be neccessary for any DVD, I didn't pay all this money to have to fast forward through the credits)...and it would have been nice for there to have been episode commentary or the TV episode previews.

I waited a while to purchase Deep Space Nine on dvd, waiting not only for a good price, but for a time when I would have a chance to spend some serious time with one of my all-time favorite shows. When the now-familiar amazon package arrived, it made my day, and I immediately put the first disc in. My emotional response was immediate, and quite intense: it felt like coming home after many years away. I hadn't quite realized until that moment just how much I'd missed coming to this place each week. The premiere was set up perfectly, introducing the major characters and conflicts that would play out over the course of the season, and, ultimately, the series.

The strength of DS9, as its fans will tell you, is in its depth. Setting the show in a stationary locale, the major plot-ines involved places and characters that would be back week after week, season after season. The regional conflict between Bajor and Cardassia, in particular, of necessity had to be complex enough to form the backbone of the overall story. The show couldn't introduce a story element and resolve everything tidily as the ship went on its merry way. The people stayed where they were, for the most part, and each plot added to the tapestry.

For this show to work, the characters had to be strong, as well, and boy are they ever. The strong Commander (later Captain). The Bajoran freedom-fighter torn between old loyalties and new.

There are bonds of friendship and love, but of conflicts and rivalries as well.

Granted, only my 42"" 3LCD HDTV I don't expect the expanded picture to be perfect, that's what HDDVD is for, but on a 27"" TV it should look spectaculer and it doesn't.

2122695,5,B0002V7TNI,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is the most unique, and in my opinion the best, of the five Star Trek series.  Set on a space station and not a starship (though they get their own starship in the Defiant), Deep Space Nine gives you the chance to really live in the Star Trek universe for seven seasons.  Since the crew can't just solve planet-wide problems in 45 minutes and move on to the next system, you end up with much deeper and long-lasting storylines.  Just as one example, you first hear of the Dominion in season 2 before you ever meet them in the Season 2 finale, and they remain a major part of the series until the very last episode.  Actions have consequences for every character.  And there are as many fascinating recurring characters as there are in the main cast.

Due to its ongoing-story-line nature, this is also the best Trek series to own on DVD--catching an episode now and again on TV just doesn't cut it as well with Deep Space Nine.  Season one starts out fairly slow (except for gems ""Emissary,"" ""Duet"" and ""In the Hands of the Prophets"") but gets better and better withe very season right up until the end.  Season 6 is, in my opinion, the best season of any Star Trek series.

The characters, stories, and setting are rich and deep. Everything seems to flow logically through-out the series.

2122716,5,B0002V7TNI,"For those who like exciting effects this set will make your day.  I started watching this series about a year later after seeing Star Trek TNG which was again something to do during the cold winter.  The series had excitement, adventure, comedy, some romance, and even tragedy.  The first two seasons was like settling in on the station just like being on a vacation in space.  Here you meet interesting visitors including some TNG visitors such as Q and Lwaxana Troi.  My favorite visitors were the Grand Nagus Zek and Moogie.  They were pretty funny and humorous.  Then as it got into the third season and onward, things started to get serious.  Relations with the Cardassions and the Klingon were broken as war begins to break out at Bajor and DS9.  For defense the Federeration gave DS9 a fast starship named the Defiant.  I loved the Defiant very much because like the Enterprise they too were using it to explore nearby areas of space.  Thanks to Worf joining the DS9 crew in the fourth season he was able to convince the Klingons to help the Federation to fight the war and win back DS9 from the Cardassion invasion in seasion six.  In season seven,  the Dominion forces who was ally to the Cardassions turned on them and invaded Cardassia forcing them to call the Federation to help.  Finally the Federation came as the war on Cardassia ended with a peace treaty and a withdrawl of all Dominion forces from Cardassia.  This was one series that gave me the most reactions.  In some episodes when members of the Dominion would maturilize on a planet with the landing party by surprise I would yell out ""Oh Oh!"" because this meant trouble.  In another episode during the war,  when I saw the the Defiant exploding I yelled out ""Oh No!"" as my favorite ship on DS9 was gone.  My favorite episode was ""Trails and Tribbilations"" which again brought memories of an old classic episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" where DS9 crew had to stop Darnell from changing the past which was killing Captain Kirk with a bomb.  Here DS9 crew had to search around on the old Enterprise and space station while looking at scenes from the episode including the funny parts.

Once again what I did not like was season finales with started with a beginning but no ending.  When aired on the FOX Network they kept showing reruns instead of part two thanks to the lousy writers and producers.  But with DVD set you don't have to worry you can see the whole story togethor at once on the same day not twelve weeks like before.  I also noticed by episodes day after day I can keep up with the story as well as having a better understanding of what is going on episode after episode.  The other dislike about the set is the high prices.  My stratgy to simply buy one series at a time once a year by shopping around for the best price.

Deep Space Nine doesn't even come close to the acting, imaginative, and thought-provoking qualities of the original ST and TNG.

2122729,3,B0002V7TNI,"Briefly put, this was a great and very underrated series that I preferred over all other Star Trek series, even the mostly excellent NextGen. Probably because, unlike TNG, DS9 was not afraid to be about non-idealized heroes, and because the writers on 'Nine were willing to take chances in dark, humorous, and unexpected ways.

Would give it 5 stars, but I have to dock it one star for the (ridiculously high) price, and the fact that this series really deserved (and was plotted out for) an eighth season, but was denied it due to some truly idiotic decision-making by the suits at Viacom and Paramount.

Would also add that, as much as I'd like to buy the series, I won't until the price comes down to about $60/season, and $399 or less for the 7-season box set. That's fair, the current pricing isn't... its just greed + stupidity on Viacom/Paramount's part.

Hey V/P, my credit card's always at the ready if you ever decide to get realistic about this.

PS- Since I wrote this review, the Viacom/Paramount suits have taken one step forward, one step back on pricing.

The good news: The first three seasons of DS9 are now available for around $55 each- a very fair price, and I encourage anyone interested in the series to pick them up, especially Season 3 (the show was still finding its legs in Season 1, and for part of Season 2).

Judging from the (VASTLY) improved Amazon sales ranks for these seasons, the lower prices have definitely goosed sales, so perhaps the suits will finally get it through their skulls that this is the way to go.

The BAD news: The price for the full 7-season set jumped from the already-ridiculous $630 or so to $818. LOL, just too funny, especially considering that with the price drops on the first 3 seasons, you can still buy the 7 seasons individually for $630 and save nearly two hundred bucks. Not that you'd really want to, since you'd still be vastly overpaying for Seasons 4 thru 7.

Even if you are a huge DS9 junkie, I'd say hold off 'til all the seasons are at the Seasons 1-3 price, and the total series' box set drops to $399 or so. That's the fair price, too bad Viacom still doesn't get it.

PPS- (1/10/11) Well, whaddya know? FINALLY a good price on the Complete Series set. Yay Viacom, you finally got it together. Or it just wasn't selling at the ridiculous former price, whichever.",1137024000,27,2339,4.563245823389021

2122732,5,B0002V7TNI,"I love The Original Series and Next Generation of Star Trek, but Deep Space Nine really has a special place in my heart. This show is nothing short of unbelievable. The story unfolds slowly, as the characters develop and more and more mysterious are unveiled. By the end of the series, there were MANY very important characters. Also, as the show's story was not completely outlined in advance, it doesn't get as extremely epic as Bablyon 5, for example.
Anyway, this show starts out as a spin-off from a TNG plotline (stared in the episode 'Ensign Ro,' in case you were wondering) in which the Cardassians, a powerful and corrupt empire, have occupied the downtrodden and once advanced planet Bajor. Captain Sisko, whose wife was killed by Captain Picard's Borg alter-ego of sorts, must command a dilapidated and abandoned space station after the Cardassians suddenly pull out. However, it gets much more complicated than that, and this is just the beginning. Watch 'Emissary' and the story will begin to unfold.
Anyway, enough said about the series itself. I highly recommend it, and have a feeling you will truly enjoy it. There are a couple mediocre episodes, mostly in the first and second seasons.
[...]  It's quite frankly way too expensive. It would actually be cheaper to buy each set individually, unless you go to [...], where you can get the whole series used for something in the range of 300 dollars. If you're really low on dough, go for the Asian collector's/bootleg edition (there are Chinese official ones, but they are really hard to differentiate from the bootlegs.) You can get that for the screaming deal of under 100 dollars. But then you run the risk of getting copies whose episodes cut off early, causing you to often miss the last 5 to 10 minutes of an episode. Your choice.
Anyway, you're missing a lot if you don't watch this series eventually. The one sad thing is that when it is over, you will definitely feel a void. After I finished the series, it was truly depressing. I was in a melancholy mood for about a week. Fortunately, unless you've seen everything, you can always move on to another Star Trek series, or Babylon 5, which I am in the process of enjoying now.",1133049600,7,2201,4.731770833333333

2122736,5,B0002V7TNI,"Star Trek: Deep Space 9 is without a doubt my favorite Star Trek series. Heck, it's probably my favorite TV series, period. Deep Space 9 is one of the most well crafted Sci-Fi shows ever made. Just thinking about the actual station fills me with a warm, fuzzy feeling. For those unframiliar with it, Deep Space 9 can be split into two sections. The first few seasons were more episodic (like the previous Trek series, Next Generation), and mostly featured episodes involved in the Cardassian/Bajoran struggle. The second half of the series focused on the long and exciting Dominion War Arc, which to this day remains the longest (and most well done) arc on any Star Trek show.

The cast is the most diverse and has the best chemistry of any of the Trek shows. Avery Brook's Commander (later Captain) Sisko is a strong character, whose morals and strengths are at the center of the entire series. Really, everone does a good job on this show, from everyday man Chief of Operations Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) to shapeshifting loner Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), every character on the show if well fleshed out, and they each have strong relationships to the other characters. DS9 also had a large supporting cast, including fan favorite Garak (Andrew Robinson), the simple tailor who's more than he seems to be.

Deep Space 9 is an exciting adventure on the edge of the galaxy that you'll be hard pressed to ever forget. Perhaps better than any of the other series, Deep Space 9 was able to handle serious issues as well as offer more humorous, lighter stuff. The Next Generation may be more popular, and Voyager may have more... well, 7 of 9, but Deep Space 9 is easily the most supperior series.",1125100800,11,1700,4.720538720538721

2122738,5,B0002V7TNI,"To watch these episodes, start with a number. Give it a name. Something good no one would believe in, like the imagination. So let's say you have inspiration.

There's an episode where Jake is being mind controlled by an alien spirit who's masquerading as a woman, and she feeds off his mind for energy, but this allows him to write great words. At the end of the episode, you too have great words.

I view these episodes as magic spells. They require no imagination. You just have to have good words to begin with. Concepts.

Other episodes touch on humour and death, adding depth with every pause between character lines. There's one excellent episode that claims people die because of boredom. So the characters step into the ""Cellular Regeneration and Entertainment Machine"". Already you're fascinated.

I disagree with any name-calling of other Star Trek episodes in any other series, as I tend to think that when you like Trek it's usually just an episode. Then it's over. Not with Deep Space Nine. Unlike Voyager, which felt modular and moral, these episodes will intrigue you as their story fits together so perfectly.

It's a very introspective thing that tells you you can always do self-improvement. Even if you feel self-improved, you can always feel better. Watching these episodes made me feel very secure in myself that I was an okay person. They made me feel better. I think that's the meaning of compassion.

What matters most is that these episodes challenge you so much to accept the truth that everyone is doing bad things, smart things, funny things, and not to build a mind. Don't make a special mind or anything. Just take it as it goes. Don't form special thoughts or conclusions, beliefs, or whatnot. I think that's why that word was invented. Look it up in the dictionary. It means nothing.

I think that's also why Jadzia Dax had to be retired. When Ezri took her place in Season Seven, it was supposed to have Meaning. I thought Season Seven was the best of all of them, kind of like life, when you wait, long enough.",1121990400,10,2045,4.711484593837535

8032352,4,B0002V7TNI,"Nice set but cheap packaging. I did not notice any defects in mine, but I bought one some time after the release date, so it appears that the problem was fixed after examining all the discs.

Beware of fakes that contain 5 inner boxes as shown in the photo-they're identical otherwise.",1524960000,,285,4.588235294117647

Paramount has a way of poorly packaging them. I've seen the photos of what can happen to them. I got lucky with my purchase and the discs were fine. Don't sleep on this show.

I'm past the point of no return from Amazon, and Paramount customer service is a joke. I submitted a request for a replacement disc, and received an automated reply that I would receive a response in 2 weeks. 2 weeks go by... nothing. 3 weeks... nothing. I send a follow-up and no reply. Paramount you're horrible. If you have that many complaints that you can't respond, maybe you have some other issues that should be addressed. But you should respond to requests.",1523491200,2,608,4.4375
