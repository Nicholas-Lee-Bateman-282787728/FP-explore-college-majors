8325048,5,B000E42SNY,"When I first bought this dvd, I felt that it was inadequate, but my students liked it. As I viewed it with them, I cam to appreciate the techniques used to divert the mind from the mean words of bullies. I appreciated the inference that we. as educators sometimes force children who are trying to cope with trying situations, into the same painful experiences, as was shown by the principal sending Sally to play with her bullies, only to suffer humiliation as everyone else was picked for the game except Sally. The song was catchy, and it is something kids can sing to themselves when they feel hurt. My students like the dream, but I think that that was for its comedic value. More techniques could have been taught to ensure proper value for money, though.",1355616000,,760,4.595588235294118
8325049,4,B000E42SNY,"This DVD really appeals to kids! It's easy to follow, educational, AND entertaining. Since showing it to my 2nd grade class, they've been practically begging for more. I can't wait for subsequent episodes to come out.

The show explains what stress is, how it can effect your health if not propperly dealt with, and so on. The story involves the character Stressball Sally having to cope with some bullies in her school. Very close to home for a lot of kids, and very well executed.",1140134400,,482,4.670588235294118
