3865163,5,B0027CT8VG,"This film was one of the best films of recent memory that dealt with the Columbine shooting. Told from an insider's perspective, we can see the chaos and the fear first hand. We experience the uncertainty of friends that may have been lost coupled with the crushing reality of those that were. We see the inevitable overbearing hand of the media interfering in the lives of the survivors and more importantly, we see the psychological toll that it all takes on them. Far from being plot heavy and full of action, this movie centers on the emotional impact of the event and not on the shooting itself. This was a most welcome change of view.",1245628800,2,640,4.573913043478261
3865164,5,B0027CT8VG,"While Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" depicted a school shooting through clever (yet ultimately boring) film techniques and character stereotypes, ""April Showers"" depicts this tragic event with frightening depth and realism.",1245628800,2,218,6.3

3865166,5,B0027CT8VG,"I purchased April Showers after watching the trailer online. I didn't know if it would be good or not, and believe me when I tell you that it is well worth the price. In this emotionally charged movie, Sean (Kelly Blatz) is distraught over the loss of one of his friends to a school shooting. I think everyone remembers where they were on April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot 12 fellow students and 1 teacher at Columbine High before killing themselves. I think the director of this movie, who survived a school shooting himself, should stop whatever he's doing right now and pat himself on the back. A fresh young cast and amazing cinematography truly make this movie the best I've ever seen.",1243814400,14,712,4.6141732283464565
3865167,5,B0027CT8VG,An amazing film. Written and Directed by a Columbine survivor. The shooting scenes ring as true as any film moment I have seen. An important film as well as a great one.,1241481600,3,169,4.3125
3865247,5,B0027CT8VG,April Showers is an emotional film depicting not only the terror of school violence but also the after math. The characters are real and you can't help but feel for them as you're pulled into the circumstances that have befallen them. This is an engaging and emotional film.,1246924800,,274,4.729166666666667
3865248,4,B0027CT8VG,"From new filmmaker Andrew Robinson -- an ex-Columbine student who attended during the infamous April 1999 tragedy -- comes a movie that most people still believe should be unfilmable: the 1999 Columbine school shooting. Of course, because the material is such a sensative subject, there were films made that were loosely based on the Columbine shootings:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elephant-A-Film-By-Gus-Van-Sant/dp/B0001EFUFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elephant: A Film By Gus Van Sant</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zero-Day/dp/B0007PAMII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zero Day</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duck-Carbine-High-Massacre/dp/B0002UB2Y6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duck - Carbine High Massacre</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Room/dp/B0000BXMZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Room</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Final/dp/B00344EAIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Final</a>. However, none have come as close to the actual Columbine tragedy as ""April Showers.""

I've read all the books, seen all the evidence, read through all the eyewitness accounts and researched all the special investigative reports about that dreadful day. Although it is never actually said that the school is Columbine and that the film is ""based on actual events"" with names changed and characters added for dramatic effect, ""April Showers"" is probably as close as the filmmaking community will get to the retelling of the Columbine tragedy. Who's to say if in about 10 or more years, some new filmmaker comes along and does an exact, no-holds-barred movie on the event? But, so far, this is the best of the bunch. And who better to do it than a filmmaker who was attending the school at the time of the shootings?

Using mostly unknown actors (with the exception of Daryl Sabara (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spy-Kids-Spy-Kids-2-Island-of-Lost-Dreams/dp/B000QUU4NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spy Kids / Spy Kids 2 - Island of Lost Dreams</a>), Tom Arnold and Illeana Douglas, all giving riveting dramatic performances), Robinson sets out to fully capture the heartwrenching emotions that well up after such a tragedy, asking the enduring question: What happens now? After the camera crews and journalists -- whose overabundence feeding frenzy of coverage -- have stopped filming and calling, how do we pick up the pieces -- in the community and within ourselves? These questions are asked in abundence from every side of the spectrum as we not only see the main character deal with the death of his girlfriend April, but also see various other characters deal with the loss of friends -- both the victims and the killer.

I was a bit surprised that Robinson actually filmed the tragic event as, from the description, I thought it would merely be about the aftershocks of the tragedy. However, he shot the event in a way that was neither exploitive nor graphic. ""April"" is an emotionally gripping, haunting film. So much happens within the first half hour that I was expecting the film to end at any moment without fully satisfying my emotional investment (something that disappointingly happens quite frequently with indie films). But, to my surprise, the movie kept going and each character's journey was satisfyingly fulfilled but without that sense of finality that most studio films go for nowadays; there was still that feeling that these characters will have to live with the repercussions of this event for the rest of their lives. I also liked the fact that the shooter was not the major focus in this film; but that the focus lay on the victims and particularly the survivors. Kelly Blatz, who plays lead character Sean, and Rachel Lien, who plays April's best friend Jessica, are both superb and should be in many more movies. And composer Dominik Rausch's score is hypnotically beautiful and memorable all the way through. My only issue with the film was that there wasn't enough focus on characters whose impacts would've increased the story: namely Tom Arnold's math teacher Mr. Blackwell (who mirrors Dave Sanders) and the briefly featured Vicki (played by Janel Parrish, who has a major credit on the movie poster), who I wonder how she fit in amongst these characters. It seemed like they had great introductions only to be prematurely dropped from the overall story. I also was hoping for slightly more on the budding romance between Sean and April. However, since the time frame of this film is one school week, and there were flashbacks that could still give you a decent idea of their relationship, I guess that their scenes didn't leave too much out and wasn't too lacking.

Nevertheless, ""April Showers"" is a tremendously emotional movie that will take hold of you (particularly if you're a parent) long after the credits have stopped rolling. This is an intense piece of filmmaking with beautiful cinematography by Aaron Platt. I look forward to more of Mr. Robinson's work.",1246924800,9,5173,5.93029490616622
3865249,5,B0027CT8VG,"I finally had the chance to see this movie now that it is out on DVD and I'm glad I made the effort.  The movie is strong in all areas, the actors do an exceptional job of the nightmarish feel of the flick.  More than likely they have never experienced, first hand anything of this magnitude, yet they were able to convey an all too real sense of the confused numbness that follows a tragedy like this.

The media reaction is the common dig and pry while sporting a psuedo charade of caring and understanding.  The movie shows human nature to find an enemy someone to focus our anger on, and displays the political agendas that are usually pushed forward in light of these tragedies.  The movie at times almost feels like the camera is itself just a news camera walking through the thick of this horrendous event capturing real loss, emotion and confusion.

Personally I felt the part of this movie that stood out most to me was the point of view of the film itself.  We've seen school shooting movies an endless list of movies all trying to tackle the question of ""Why?"" Many simply tell the killers stories, the victims appear as they appear to the killers, faceless, emotionless and insignificant.  Yet this film focuses on the all too often forgotten about victims, the survivors themselves.  The survivors are left with the guilt, the sorrow and the inevitable torment while they question what they could have done to change what has happened.  This is where this movie truly finds itself is in it's ability to show us the after effects on those who experienced these horrific events.  I cannot imagine how I would ever be able to get up and be able to live a normal life again after living through something this awful and senseless.

The movie itself sums it up best during the end credits when the film is dedicated not only to the victims of every school shooting in the United States (killers who died are included), But also to all those who survived.  This film doesn't provide any answers, it doesn't solve the questions we keep asking when these events occur.  It does however help us, if just for a moment empathize with those who've been there, and for that moment the world feels just a little less detached.",1245974400,6,2225,4.585858585858586
3865250,4,B0027CT8VG,"I had the pleasure of viewing this fine film in the theatre.  Unfortunately, powers that be rated this film ""R"", which it is not.  While it does not avoid the harsh reality of events surrounding a high school shooting, it does not dwell on the violence.  Rather, this film gives an entirely new perspective to the affect on and trauma endured by the survivors of such an event.  It gave me a whole new perspective, not only on the individual, but violence in schools as a whole.  Every American should watch this film.",1245888000,3,518,4.526881720430108
3865251,5,B0027CT8VG,"I have seen this movie three times in the theater, own a copy of the DVD , sound track and several posters. If it were still in local theaters I would see it again. It will stay with you for a very long time. It touches you deeply and profoundly. The music, acting and story comes from the heart and soul. For those people out there who care about the world and making it a place worth sharing and enjoying take the time to experience the message Andrew Robinson and his wonderful cast and crew have created in April Showers. No one is exempt from the underlying meaning this film portrays.

3865252,5,B0027CT8VG,"April Showers (based on actual events) focuses on the aftermath of a devastating school shooting. This perspective is what makes this film so compelling. We get to see what happens next. How do the students and families cope? How does a community heal from such trauma? Seeing this perspective from the mind of a Columbine survivor makes it even more compelling.

I was completely ripped apart by the story of one student (played brilliantly by Daryl Sabara) who suffers post-traumatic stress following the shooting. It's so well done, real and felt.

There are images from this beautifully shot film that I'll never get out of my mind. (At least that's how it feels, they're still there months later.) The cinematography and score are both brilliant and tragic.

This is a film that I feel would make a huge difference for teenagers and parents- in creating an open dialogue. I hope that it reaches people far and wide for this reason alone.",1245628800,3,942,4.838509316770186
3865253,5,B0027CT8VG,"Such a tremendously done film-- the facial control and emotion is not contrived, the music is beautiful and original, the choices by the director are tasteful and keep your interest. This is a movie that should be showing in schools everywhere, and a movie that inspires conversation. We tend to really care about a cause or issue when it's immediately in our face, and over time we forget, and go back to the behaviors that caused the incident in the first place. We need to continue as a culture to fight against school violence, and to cultivate the attitudes and behaviors in our children that are needed to create a positive environment in our schools. This movie reminds us of that.",1245628800,3,688,4.694214876033058

3865255,5,B0027CT8VG,"April Showers is a riveting story about surviving an unimaginable event.  The acting is superb and draws the audience into the lives of the characters.  Heart wrenching yet tastefully done without graphic, gory details.  The focus is on the emotional pain the survivors experience and how they attempt to deal with it.  Excellent movie about a difficult subject.",1245628800,2,362,5.189655172413793
3865256,5,B0027CT8VG,"April Showers is a movie that will touch you and leave you thinking.  It portrays not only what happened at Columbine High School, but also the sinking reality of what is happening everywhere.

8354562,5,B0027CT8VG,This movie was very scaring but sometimes it happens in real life also! It is hard to know how to prevent it from happening because of diagnosing mental illness in someone that is psycho with a gun.,1410739200,,198,4.378378378378378

8354565,4,B0027CT8VG,"Despite the kind of cheesy name (""April Showers""?  Really?), I was impressed by this movie.  Told from the perspective of the victims of a school shooting, the movie is like a roller coaster in that it shoots the viewer from a stand-still to 100 mph in about a blink of an eye.  Cast with a majority of unknowns (at least to me), the acting was excellent, and the script realistic, if a little heavy on the romantic subplot.

I liked this movie so much better than ""Elephant"" (which could have been condensed to about 15 minutes), and is an excellent companion to ""Zero Day"", which focuses on the killers and their motives.",1359849600,,623,4.535714285714286
8354566,5,B0027CT8VG,Good School shooter movie. Liked the ending (that there is no happy ending for something like that) But what really stuck out in my head was how GREAT the acting is in this film! You are going to see the kids in this film down the road in bigger things. Mark my words. See it for the story & really enjoy the skill of all involved.,1262390400,2,331,4.03030303030303
8354567,3,B0027CT8VG,This is a very disturbing movie.  It moves very slow and I struggled to sit through it.  I am just going to say it was OK but I never really got into it.  I could have stopped watching it anytime but I was bored and finished the movie. I gave it 3 stars because I think the story needed to be told especially after all the college shootings we have had.  It just did not seem real to me nor was I impressed with the acting.  I would have liked to rated this as a 2.5 stars.,1254355200,,473,3.8350515463917527
8354568,5,B0027CT8VG,"This is a well made movie based on the mental trauma suffered by a survivor of the Columbine High School tragedy.  Kelly Blatz was simply wonderful, great acting.  Although an event like this is unlikely to happen in my country as we have very strict `gun laws' nevertheless this true story make us become more aware of our responsibilities as parents and teachers.  Parents must always look for signs of depression and aggression in their children and teachers must be just as aware to prevent such a tragedy from occuring.  In the aftermath of such a tragedy the adults again play an important role to help survivors overcome the trauma.  See it, experience it and learn from it.",1253836800,,681,4.737288135593221
8354569,1,B0027CT8VG,"April Showers.
The title alone carries with it the melodramatic weight of an emo-boy writing to his lost love.
This is a movie that points to our flawed human psychology; we need easy answers.  We need easy closure.  We need fixes.  We don't want to believe the world can be dark, scary, random, and unexplainable.  Movies, in one way, are a perfect resource for this idea.  However, in the objective look at things, personal tragedies such as Columbine, when given this 'easy' spin, can result in Disney-esque results.  Why approach horror in such a way?  What if the Holocaust was portrayed in such melodrama?  Or Pearl Harbor (see: Michael Bay film)?  It removes dialogue and thought from the topic in favor of a storybook portrayal; easy open, easy close.
Columbine, school shootings, teen violence; these are topics to be discussed, to be debated, and to be a foundation for teaching critical thought in regards to the violence-in-art(media) issue.  A vision of the events like April Showers, in which we have sweeping scores, action-style editing and cinematography, and an 'everything is going to be okay' outlook seems like spitting in the face of the spectator; let's give the audience some credit.

I also call into question the intentions of the director, one of the survivors of the event.  During all trailers for this movie, and all clips found on youtube, there is a scroll bar instructing people to purchase the DVD of the film.  There is certainly a confusing blend of consumable spectacle at work here.  While I do not deny or invalidate his feelings and thoughts, his execution seems a little strange.  (I also have to wonder why, based on his testimonies of the shooting, he would craft such a subjective and fictional piece?)

This is why I only give this movie one star.  From a technical standpoint, this is a well made film; it LOOKS like a high budget film.  But was this the point?  Form and content are inextricably tied, let's not forget this.  If a film's form is reminiscient of a sweeping action epic, the content will reflect as such.
This should have been high class catharsis.  Instead, it's fast food.",1247616000,3,2136,4.813186813186813
8354570,5,B0027CT8VG,"WoW.......what a remarkable movie based on a horrible event. The main characters did some excellent acting. I love Tom Arnold who did an great job. The movie was very tense. Great story from a Great Director.
