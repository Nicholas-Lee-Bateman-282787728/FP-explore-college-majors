8348379,5,B00200KHM4,"I am grateful to the director (Hidetoshi) for conversing with me about this film while it was being released for the film festivals, and sending a preview copy so that my students could study this film along with the poem for our IB class. He wrote that the film would most likely spark controversy and interesting conversations regarding his divergent interpretations of the relationship between the traditionally medieval reading and his more analytical reading of the poem. We spend a lot of time discussing Keats' conflict between pursuing his art as encouraged by Leigh Hunt and other friends.... or staying with Fanny in England, where she may have been seen as a distraction. The director's presentation of the poet/artist versus the femmefatale/intoxication of art/fame/beauty is gorgeously rendered in this film. I applaud the interlinear reading of ""the question"" and ""the dilemma"" facing an artist. ""What will you give?"" The dichotomy between choosing art or choosing the safe path is universal and pertinent to Keats' own journey.  Read the poem, watch the film-- you will not regret it.",1456272000,,1099,5.209039548022599
8348380,5,B00200KHM4,"I have been waiting years for this short film to be released. It is beautiful in a mystical sort of way.  Even though it is only about 15 minutes long it remains true to the poem it is based on, I wish it was longer, but what you get is quality.",1272931200,,245,3.803921568627451
