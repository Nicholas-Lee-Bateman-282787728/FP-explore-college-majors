8141605,3,B000HWXO4U,"I have long given up that pop stars will include all their videos in one set. As the case here, See You and The Meaning Of Love never appeared in any Depeche Mode collection. So I'll have to thank YouTube for filling the void!

Depeche Mode is fond of using plants and flowers on their covers for Exciter and Violator. However, the content here is far from the pure white rose pictured. Many videos have disturbing and/or adult themes, so you might want to keep it from minors.

The general themes of construction, cars, isolation in big places, temptresses and whorehouses are pretty consistent throughout.

Personal Jesus shows the group visiting a whorehouse in the middle of a big lonely desert. In I Feel You, a temptress saunters in and poses seductively next to a statue of a religious figure to juxtapose sin and religion. Rather distubing like their song Blasphemous Rumours. Barrel Of  A Gun sees Dave Gahan doing a spot of automatic writing while possessed. Suffer Well has him walking pass a place with the signage HELL SUFFER WELL and then coming to a shop with Martin Gore dressed as a bride. It's all so subtle.

When you watch the videos in succession, it is easy to see the change in directors. Everything Counts, People Are People and Master And Servant by Clive Richardson are kind of similar, using machinery and construction to match the music. Then videos seven to 17 are helmed by Anton Corbijn, who's fond of using grainy shots of the vast desert. There are also two versions of Enjoy The Silence.

So yes, The Best Of Volume 1 is incomplete but on the whole it is still a decent set with enough rock and roll themes to freak out conservatives. Just don't air this during family gatherings.",1318550400,,1714,4.64026402640264

8141608,1,B000HWXO4U,I have been looking for a collection of videos by Depeche Mode.  I purchased this cause I liked the songs listed.  When I got it the region was wrong.  It looks like all the ones available are not able to be played in the USA so BE CAREFUL.  I'm currently trying to get a refund on a return of the dvd.  Not fun!,1202947200,3,312,3.888888888888889

8141610,5,B000HWXO4U,"This is a great collection of videos.  Good for new fans, as a gift, and even good for old fans.  It is a great overview of the most popular work (and videos) from dm.  I would help the previous commentor and give a track listing, but frankly I'm too lazy to go downstairs and get it, and he/she should learn to use a search engine.  Also, very tasteless to give a bad review on a product when you are aiming at Amazon for not giving a track listing.  Get it straight.",1196208000,5,468,4.0989010989010985

I mean this is a U.S. release and not some German import.  the link they suggest for ""more information on this product"" is useless.  needless to say, amazon has made it way too much work to buy this product from them.  Perhaps Boarders.com may be more informative.",1196208000,,465,4.542168674698795
