3113099,4,B0013JG7IQ,"The art direction and cinematography are great.  But what's really exciting is the emotional depth(lacking in the original fairy-tale libretto) that's added by reimagining the setting as  the battlefields of World War I.  The libretto is translated (perfectly appropriate for Mozart, who authorized both Italian and German versions of Marriage of Figaro), and the new English lyrics revitalize the story without straying too far from the original.  I'm not sure this would  be a good introduction to the opera, but if you know it already, each new twist is a delight.
The singing is lovely.  It's not world-class opera quality, but it's more than adequate for what this is, which is a great movie rather than a visual record of a great performance.",1236556800,11,748,5.040650406504065
3113100,3,B0013JG7IQ,"This is not the first time that the Magic Flute is delivered as a film.  It is almost impossible to forget the great rendition of this opera by Bergman in 1975.  Although the spirit of Bergman is present in Branagh's version of Mozart's opera, Branagh is far much darker in his approach.  I do not think that this is a film for people who really know about opera.  Firstly it is considered almost an obscene practice in the opera world to change the language in which the opera was originally conceived by the composer (Bergman does it too).  Secondly, although the orchestra is quite good, most of the singers have a hard time trying to sing their parts.  Lyubov Petrova as the Queen of the Night and  Tom Randle as Monostatos are the only exceptions in the whole cast.  They are really good.  Joseph Kaiser as Tamino gets better towards the end but his start is pretty bad.  The rest of the cast migth be good for a Broadway's musical but Mozart is a complete different story.  Amy Carson, in the extremely important role of Pamina, is probably the worse of the whole cast.  She has a very small and unidimensional voice that cannot be enhanced even with the audio magics.  Ren Pape as Sarastro has an extremely uneven and shallow voice that does not correspond with the role.  Benjamin Jay Davis is completely forgettable as Papageno too.  I have the feeling that with a better cast this film would have worked much better, at least for an opera aficionado audience.  In these days of Eurotrash productions of classical operas in almost every european stage, I do not think I should criticize Branagh's rather traditional interpretation of the original libretto. Moreover, I really like his fresh approach to a very well known subject.  Apart from some common places that could have been avoided I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.  Although I am not a big fan of this director I have to admit that he usually puts the best of himself in his projects.  You can easily feel in this film the love and trust of the director for what he is doing.",1218067200,13,2051,4.5698630136986305
3113101,5,B0013JG7IQ,"It's a unique approach to the storyline of Mozart's Die Zauberflte, which wasn't known for the coherency of it's libretto, by Emanuel Schikaneder, anyway.  Kenneth Branagh is probably best known for his increasingly experimental Film adaptions of Shakespearean plays, and he brings that mindset to The Magic Flute.  The story is transported to a fairytale-esque riff on WWI, scrubbed of the majority of its masonic, racial and misogynistic elements, and given an english libretto by Stephen Fry.  All of this is well and good to me as a causal opera buff- it may offend the sensibilities of more trained ears, but I appreciate the efforts to make opera more accessible to contemporary audiences.  The way I see it, if Mozart insisted his works be performed in German rather than Italian because it was the music ""of the people,"" then why wouldn't a British director (who caters to a British/North American audience and is known for wanting to make notoriously difficult sources more accessible to the masses) want to translate to the language ""of the people""?  It seems a natural progression, though there are a few moments where they could have taken the license in ordering or libretto to iron out issues in continuity present in the original work that are puzzlingly left intact.

Branagh chose mostly unknowns (at least in American film) that could sing their parts over Hollywood faces with dubbed, or worse, poorly sung, vocals.  I agree with the decision completely.  The cast is excellent- Benjamin Jay Davis as Papageno was probably my favorite.  The music that I have loved from childhood is all there and intact and beautifully sung, to my untrained ear.

The storyline is a bit silly, as it always was, and I respect Branagh for just going with that.  Sometimes it goes too far- there are moments in the Queen of the Night's aria I get dizzy and just want the camera and/or character to stop jumping around, or would rather not be looking at a closeup of her molars as she hits the famous high notes.  Other than that, it's rich and beautiful and full of life.  It's quite storybookish in the manner of 2003's Peter Pan.  It's probably not going to appeal to people who never were interested in opera to begin with, but for someone who loves musical and has an interest in classical music, this is a very good introduction to the genre.",1466121600,2,2348,4.794044665012407

3113105,5,B0013JG7IQ,"This is a beautiful versionof Mozart's great opera.
Kenneth Branagh performs his usual brilliant direction giving us magnificent beauty even in the trenches and horror of Word War 1. Photography and editing is perfect. Even those who are not familiar with the Mozart opera, or even like opera,could appreciate this movie on a strictly ""musical"" basis.  eg "" Little shop of Horrors"", ""The King and I"" or any Rogers and Hammerstein musical.
Branagh uses relatively lesser known singers except for the Sarasastro role - Rene Pape.
When the Queen of the Night enters on a tank I was sold!!! And can this lady sing!
Watch it on the internet - a Russian download but buy the DVD. It's magnificent.
Wish I could get it on Blu-ray but apparently Hollywood or the US studios think the public will not buy quality recordings of ""OPERA"" for them to make a profit.",1457136000,,852,4.718120805369128
3113106,5,B0013JG7IQ,"If Bergman's ""Flute"" was full of bright, childlike magic, Branagh's magic is dark and threatening. This is (on;ly) the fourth version of ""Flute"" I've experienced, so I'm no opera expert. But this is the first version in which I felt that the promised happiness was under serious threat. The nobility, the romance, and the comedy are also there, but until the very end, we aren't sure that we have emerged from darkness. The overture conveyed tension; the Queen of the Night was really scary, Sarastro was wise and compassionate, Papageno/a was/were delightful. I didn't miss the Masonic symbolism and spiritual growth motifs, which were  replaced by the idea that love may lead the way to brotherhood, healing and peace.

I was going to the opera before there were subtitles in the houses.  While I enjoyed the music, I never knew what was happening.

3113119,4,B0013JG7IQ,"This movie is imagination at full power.  It is a movie, so it already makes it different than a staged production, and some purist may object to the lip singing. I started watching and was taken aback by the war scenes, too real to me, but it didn't take long to move to the magic world, magic scenes and, of course, Mozarts music.  It is sung in English but there are not subtitles. It is very often difficult to understand the English lyrics, but the scenes and the music more than compensate for this flaw.  Musically it is an enjoyable production of the Magic Flute. It is not an outstanding musical rendition, but I don't think that was the purpose of the production.  Because the first scenes are too real, I wouldnt recommend it for young audiences, it is supposed to be magic, irrespective of the actual place or the actual period it is set up, and the film succeeds very well in that.  The acting of the protagonists (and singers) is quite good and believable, much more than in a stage production.  I strongly recommend this movie to those who know the opera and are open to some inventive cinema interpretation.  Too bad, there is no insert with the DVD and almost no information about the concept, the English lyrics or anything else.  The interviews in the extras fill some of this gap, but I cant understand why after making such an effort to create a successful movie, they went so cheap on the information.

3113125,5,B0013JG7IQ,"I highly recommend this production. With some wonderful sets this beloved opera , to me my favorite Mozart- has been placed in a WWI ""reality"". Here was an opportunity to have opposing armies come together for a little Christmas party thanks to the transforming effect of the magic fltue and chime box of Papageno. You ought to be somewhat bedazzled by the technical difficulty of this set design. I have no problem with the concept at all..rather nice, , in fact, I'd like to see even more imaginative productions like this one...the Swedish version by reknown film maker Ingrid Bergman is still my favorite so far.

I have one complaint, which doesn't take away from this production, except for those of us with white whiskers. It is sung
in English. Boooooo.

Beverly Sills tried this with ""La Fille du Regiment""..and that too, I hardly caught a single word that was intelligeable. It just does NOT work! To understand this, you sort of have to be that age where the eyesight is not so great, nor the hearing - all of us lose the upper range. Once you arrive at this sorry state, you will obsrve that NO ONE speaks the King's English well!..especially young people who are talking faster and faster and faster with each passing year. Today, any youth could ba an auctioneer...it wouldn't matter if youdidn't understand them...all except for ""going, going...sold""

Those of us who sing, know that when we sing in Italian, the best language for singing, period...each and every vowel has a strictly precise shaping of the mouth lips and tongue. There is some variance re.  intonation,,resonating farther back in the
mouth and throat, and sometimes forward...all achieved by precision movements and shaping - round for ""O""...wide open for ""A"", almost a grimace for ""i"" or ""ee""; lips protruding for ""U"" ""oo"".Italian voice coaches have been known to train young singers for months , working on just the vowels..and then gradually teaching to just touch on a consonant, but touch on it with great clarity! You will know a ""T"" from a ""D"", or a ""P"" froma ""B"". You can observe this now ~ that you know...watch great Italian singers, and Spanish ones, of course, Domingo,Jose BRos, Carreras, Caballe, Maria Bayo, etc.,  and you will clearly see the mouth shapes I describe above.

Then observe in the ""features"" track of this DVD, the interview with the producer and actor kenneth Branagh..watch carefully as he speaks through a narrow slit of lips..bringing the lips together only if he absolutely HAS to...this is how all young people today speak...doing virtually all the pronouncing in the very back of the throat, with barely moving lips.

In a word?...""Gargling words""...gargling! The lips are there for a reason, people!

And singing coloratura embellishments and roccoco curly cues, a dozen notes or more on one freaking syllable...and do you think that is understood? it is impossible to understand!..So..my friends with white whiskers...you are forewarned...you absolutely must know the story very well to know what the hell is going on with this production.",1379980800,3,3061,4.97651663405088

Ingmar Bergman had his go, producing a classic treatment, and now it is Branagh's turn. His film is lushly imaginative, but in my view overly so.  There are so many self consciously brilliant ideas that the mind and the heart find no place to rest.

I was disappointed by the music track. Tempos are rushed, probably to keep pace witb Branagh's vision, and the singing is uneven, to say the least (In the Bergman film, a so-so performance was salvaged by the directorial genius). The weakest link in this current film is the utterly miscast Tamina, not particularly compelling in her physical presence, but, much more crucial, with almost no singing voice at all.  How did an intelligent director manage to make such a colossal mistake?

If this treatment helps to find new friends for Mozart's transcendentaly  beautiful score, than so much the better. Mozart's music is eternal, after all.",1374451200,,1059,4.96045197740113

3113133,4,B0013JG7IQ,"Branaghs Magic Flute took 7 years to find a release here in the States. Finally we get a very limited release to theaters and simultaneously a DVD at a ridiculously low price.

Following the current trend in opera this is the director's final viewpoint - not necessarily the composer, the librettist, the music. So Branagh sets his Magic Flute in the trenches of World War I. What? You are going to play one of the most magical of operas in the most realistic of settings! Ridiculous.

 When ""regie theater"" (Eurotrash) is bad it destroys the original work unless the musicians can overcome whatever distractions the director throws their way.

 But when it works you come away with new insights and appreciation for the work. And that's what happens here. Bragagh and Steven Fry (Monty Pithon) translated and rewrote the screenplay and Fry did the lyrics. I'm not going to describe the production in any detail because I want you to have the pleasure of wondering how they are going to do something. How will the Queen of the Night enter? You'll be amazed and probably let out an ""ah ha!""  I wept tears of sheer joy at the ending: something that has never happened to me with the Flute before.

 The reason I'm giving this DVD only four stars is presentation. There are no subtitles. And even if an opera is in English you need subtitles although Branagh does a great job with ennunciation. But it is almost impossible to understand the women singing. And that's a shame because Fry's lyrics are wonderful - witty and funny.
 Second there is a minimum of packaging. Not even an insert of a cast list. And why are these people putting the cast lists at the very end of the DVD rather than at the beginning where they always identify the director and conductor. Most singers unknown but really good singing actors. True, the only name in the cast is Rene Pape who steals the show as Sarastro. But I do think some of these singers will become famous soon.

3113139,5,B0013JG7IQ,"Kenneth Branagh and Stephen Fry have reworked Mozart's strange but beautiful comic opera ""The Magic Flute"" as an anti-war story set in the first world war. The music and acting are brilliant: aspects of the revised story are very peculiar (though no more so than the original) but in general it is both beautiful and entertaining.

In the original story, the hero Tamino (Joseph Kaiser) is a prince: here he is a junior officer in the army of some unidentified European power, and at the start of the film he and his men are sent ""over the top"" in an attack on the enemy trenches.

Where the 18th century opera had the hero attacked by a serpent and rescued by three ladies, in this version the ladies (Teuta Koco, Louise Callinan, and Kim-Marie Woodhouse) appear, initially, as nurses and rescue him from a cloud of poison gas. Recovering consciousness, he finds himself in a slightly different World War One trench system, where he meets the ""bird man"" Papageno (brilliantly sung and acted by Benjamin Jay Davies.) In this version the bird man uses his feathered friends to check for clean air: as in the original he also provides companionship to the hero and comic relief.

On the front where the hero now finds himself, the opposing armies are those of the Queen of the Night (Lyubov Petrova) and the sorceror Sarastro (Rene Pape), and it does not become obvious for some time which represents good and which is evil. The Queen makes her grand entrance on top of a Mark V tank and begs Tamino to rescue her daughter, Pamino (Amy Carson) who is being held prisoner in the fortress of Sarastro. Tamino and Papageno set off to rescue her, but it is soon apparent that in this magic world few things are what they seem ...

Director Kenneth Branagh, who co-wrote the screenplay with Stephen Fry, has removed most of Mozart's masonic symbolism, though not quite all, and replaced it with imagery reflecting the horror and waste of war. Stephen Fry produced a new English libretto to reflect this. For example, the song which in the original has the lyrics ""O Isis and Osiris"" has been given completely new words to fit a commemoration of the dead, which is taking place in a war cemetary, with a message pleading for peace.

One aspect which has been changed hardly at all is Papageno's desperate desire to find the girl of his dreams, Papagena (Silvia Moi) and their eventual meeting is brilliantly funny.

""The Magic Flute"" contains perhaps the most beautiful song ever written for the human voice, the Queen of the Night's aria, which in context is also one of the most shocking things ever written. I presume Lyubov Petrova must have first recorded this in a studio and then mimed to her own voice while filming: both her singing and acting are first rate, and this scene is both psychedelic and truly horrifying.

Nobody with more imagination than a stone ever forgets the first time they see this aria performed in context and those watching this DVD who have not previously seen a stage or film version of ""The Magic Flute"" will find it no exception - it will sear itself into your memory.

Parts of the opera, like the original, are pretty nonsensical, but it worked for me. The singing, both from the main performers and the backing from the Chorus Apollo Voices, was excellent throughout, as was the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Special Effects were very cleverly done.

I agree with those reviewers who thought that subtitles would have been useful: the male performers were without exception easy to follow and I didn't have too much difficulty making out what Amy Carson as Pamina or Silvia Moi as Papagena were singing. However, Mozart's music, beautiful as it is, makes extreme demands on the voice in certain places, particularly for the Queen of the Night and the three ladies, and there were certainly sections where I had difficulty making out the new words which Stephen Fry had written for these characters.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed this version. If you are a fan of Mozart in general or the Magic Flute in particular, buy or rent this, and I think you are most unlikely to regret it.",1273622400,43,4105,4.712691771269177
3113140,5,B0013JG7IQ,"Based on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's final opera, ""Die Zauberflote,"" renowned actor-writer-director Kenneth Branagh's film is a visual wonder and a musical triumph in every sense of the words. Sadly, this beautiful movie is not available in Region 1, but it should be seen everywhere, and appreciated. For me, it off-sets the semi-disappointment I feel of his remake of ""Sleuth."" The acting, cinematography and everything else was top-notch. I highly recommend this movie, and would rate it PG for mild violence, both war-related and comic.

3347596,4,B0013JG7IQ,"The art direction and cinematography are great.  But what's really exciting is the emotional depth(lacking in the original fairy-tale libretto) that's added by reimagining the setting as  the battlefields of World War I.  The libretto is translated (perfectly appropriate for Mozart, who authorized both Italian and German versions of Marriage of Figaro), and the new English lyrics revitalize the story without straying too far from the original.  I'm not sure this would  be a good introduction to the opera, but if you know it already, each new twist is a delight.
The singing is lovely.  It's not world-class opera quality, but it's more than adequate for what this is, which is a great movie rather than a visual record of a great performance.",1236556800,11,748,5.040650406504065
3347597,3,B0013JG7IQ,"This is not the first time that the Magic Flute is delivered as a film.  It is almost impossible to forget the great rendition of this opera by Bergman in 1975.  Although the spirit of Bergman is present in Branagh's version of Mozart's opera, Branagh is far much darker in his approach.  I do not think that this is a film for people who really know about opera.  Firstly it is considered almost an obscene practice in the opera world to change the language in which the opera was originally conceived by the composer (Bergman does it too).  Secondly, although the orchestra is quite good, most of the singers have a hard time trying to sing their parts.  Lyubov Petrova as the Queen of the Night and  Tom Randle as Monostatos are the only exceptions in the whole cast.  They are really good.  Joseph Kaiser as Tamino gets better towards the end but his start is pretty bad.  The rest of the cast migth be good for a Broadway's musical but Mozart is a complete different story.  Amy Carson, in the extremely important role of Pamina, is probably the worse of the whole cast.  She has a very small and unidimensional voice that cannot be enhanced even with the audio magics.  Ren Pape as Sarastro has an extremely uneven and shallow voice that does not correspond with the role.  Benjamin Jay Davis is completely forgettable as Papageno too.  I have the feeling that with a better cast this film would have worked much better, at least for an opera aficionado audience.  In these days of Eurotrash productions of classical operas in almost every european stage, I do not think I should criticize Branagh's rather traditional interpretation of the original libretto. Moreover, I really like his fresh approach to a very well known subject.  Apart from some common places that could have been avoided I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.  Although I am not a big fan of this director I have to admit that he usually puts the best of himself in his projects.  You can easily feel in this film the love and trust of the director for what he is doing.",1218067200,13,2051,4.5698630136986305
3347598,5,B0013JG7IQ,"It's a unique approach to the storyline of Mozart's Die Zauberflte, which wasn't known for the coherency of it's libretto, by Emanuel Schikaneder, anyway.  Kenneth Branagh is probably best known for his increasingly experimental Film adaptions of Shakespearean plays, and he brings that mindset to The Magic Flute.  The story is transported to a fairytale-esque riff on WWI, scrubbed of the majority of its masonic, racial and misogynistic elements, and given an english libretto by Stephen Fry.  All of this is well and good to me as a causal opera buff- it may offend the sensibilities of more trained ears, but I appreciate the efforts to make opera more accessible to contemporary audiences.  The way I see it, if Mozart insisted his works be performed in German rather than Italian because it was the music ""of the people,"" then why wouldn't a British director (who caters to a British/North American audience and is known for wanting to make notoriously difficult sources more accessible to the masses) want to translate to the language ""of the people""?  It seems a natural progression, though there are a few moments where they could have taken the license in ordering or libretto to iron out issues in continuity present in the original work that are puzzlingly left intact.

Branagh chose mostly unknowns (at least in American film) that could sing their parts over Hollywood faces with dubbed, or worse, poorly sung, vocals.  I agree with the decision completely.  The cast is excellent- Benjamin Jay Davis as Papageno was probably my favorite.  The music that I have loved from childhood is all there and intact and beautifully sung, to my untrained ear.

The storyline is a bit silly, as it always was, and I respect Branagh for just going with that.  Sometimes it goes too far- there are moments in the Queen of the Night's aria I get dizzy and just want the camera and/or character to stop jumping around, or would rather not be looking at a closeup of her molars as she hits the famous high notes.  Other than that, it's rich and beautiful and full of life.  It's quite storybookish in the manner of 2003's Peter Pan.  It's probably not going to appeal to people who never were interested in opera to begin with, but for someone who loves musical and has an interest in classical music, this is a very good introduction to the genre.",1466121600,2,2348,4.794044665012407

The nobility, the romance, and the comedy are also there, but until the very end, we aren't sure that we have emerged from darkness. The overture conveyed tension; the Queen of the Night was really scary, Sarastro was wise and compassionate, Papageno/a was/were delightful. I didn't miss the Masonic symbolism and spiritual growth motifs, which were  replaced by the idea that love may lead the way to brotherhood, healing and peace.

It is sung in English but there are not subtitles. It is very often difficult to understand the English lyrics, but the scenes and the music more than compensate for this flaw.  Musically it is an enjoyable production of the Magic Flute. It is not an outstanding musical rendition, but I don't think that was the purpose of the production.  Because the first scenes are too real, I wouldnt recommend it for young audiences, it is supposed to be magic, irrespective of the actual place or the actual period it is set up, and the film succeeds very well in that.  The acting of the protagonists (and singers) is quite good and believable, much more than in a stage production.

Here was an opportunity to have opposing armies come together for a little Christmas party thanks to the transforming effect of the magic fltue and chime box of Papageno. You ought to be somewhat bedazzled by the technical difficulty of this set design. I have no problem with the concept at all..rather nice, , in fact, I'd like to see even more imaginative productions like this one...the Swedish version by reknown film maker Ingrid Bergman is still my favorite so far.

I have one complaint, which doesn't take away from this production, except for those of us with white whiskers. It is sung
in English. Boooooo.

Beverly Sills tried this with ""La Fille du Regiment""..and that too, I hardly caught a single word that was intelligeable. It just does NOT work! To understand this, you sort of have to be that age where the eyesight is not so great, nor the hearing - all of us lose the upper range. Once you arrive at this sorry state, you will obsrve that NO ONE speaks the King's English well!..especially young people who are talking faster and faster and faster with each passing year. Today, any youth could ba an auctioneer...it wouldn't matter if youdidn't understand them...all except for ""going, going...sold""

Those of us who sing, know that when we sing in Italian, the best language for singing, period...each and every vowel has a strictly precise shaping of the mouth lips and tongue. There is some variance re.  intonation,,resonating farther back in the
mouth and throat, and sometimes forward...all achieved by precision movements and shaping - round for ""O""...wide open for ""A"", almost a grimace for ""i"" or ""ee""; lips protruding for ""U"" ""oo"".Italian voice coaches have been known to train young singers for months , working on just the vowels..and then gradually teaching to just touch on a consonant, but touch on it with great clarity! You will know a ""T"" from a ""D"", or a ""P"" froma ""B"". You can observe this now ~ that you know...watch great Italian singers, and Spanish ones, of course, Domingo,Jose BRos, Carreras, Caballe, Maria Bayo, etc.,  and you will clearly see the mouth shapes I describe above.

Then observe in the ""features"" track of this DVD, the interview with the producer and actor kenneth Branagh..watch carefully as he speaks through a narrow slit of lips..bringing the lips together only if he absolutely HAS to...this is how all young people today speak...doing virtually all the pronouncing in the very back of the throat, with barely moving lips.

In a word?...""Gargling words""...gargling! The lips are there for a reason, people!

And singing coloratura embellishments and roccoco curly cues, a dozen notes or more on one freaking syllable...and do you think that is understood? it is impossible to understand!..So..my friends with white whiskers...you are forewarned...you absolutely must know the story very well to know what the hell is going on with this production.",1379980800,3,3061,4.97651663405088

Tempos are rushed, probably to keep pace witb Branagh's vision, and the singing is uneven, to say the least (In the Bergman film, a so-so performance was salvaged by the directorial genius). The weakest link in this current film is the utterly miscast Tamina, not particularly compelling in her physical presence, but, much more crucial, with almost no singing voice at all.

Following the current trend in opera this is the director's final viewpoint - not necessarily the composer, the librettist, the music. So Branagh sets his Magic Flute in the trenches of World War I. What? You are going to play one of the most magical of operas in the most realistic of settings! Ridiculous.

 When ""regie theater"" (Eurotrash) is bad it destroys the original work unless the musicians can overcome whatever distractions the director throws their way.

 But when it works you come away with new insights and appreciation for the work. And that's what happens here. Bragagh and Steven Fry (Monty Pithon) translated and rewrote the screenplay and Fry did the lyrics. I'm not going to describe the production in any detail because I want you to have the pleasure of wondering how they are going to do something. How will the Queen of the Night enter? You'll be amazed and probably let out an ""ah ha!""  I wept tears of sheer joy at the ending: something that has never happened to me with the Flute before.

 The reason I'm giving this DVD only four stars is presentation. There are no subtitles. And even if an opera is in English you need subtitles although Branagh does a great job with ennunciation. But it is almost impossible to understand the women singing. And that's a shame because Fry's lyrics are wonderful - witty and funny.
 Second there is a minimum of packaging. Not even an insert of a cast list.

3347636,5,B0013JG7IQ,"Kenneth Branagh and Stephen Fry have reworked Mozart's strange but beautiful comic opera ""The Magic Flute"" as an anti-war story set in the first world war. The music and acting are brilliant: aspects of the revised story are very peculiar (though no more so than the original) but in general it is both beautiful and entertaining.

In the original story, the hero Tamino (Joseph Kaiser) is a prince: here he is a junior officer in the army of some unidentified European power, and at the start of the film he and his men are sent ""over the top"" in an attack on the enemy trenches.

Where the 18th century opera had the hero attacked by a serpent and rescued by three ladies, in this version the ladies (Teuta Koco, Louise Callinan, and Kim-Marie Woodhouse) appear, initially, as nurses and rescue him from a cloud of poison gas. Recovering consciousness, he finds himself in a slightly different World War One trench system, where he meets the ""bird man"" Papageno (brilliantly sung and acted by Benjamin Jay Davies.) In this version the bird man uses his feathered friends to check for clean air: as in the original he also provides companionship to the hero and comic relief.

On the front where the hero now finds himself, the opposing armies are those of the Queen of the Night (Lyubov Petrova) and the sorceror Sarastro (Rene Pape), and it does not become obvious for some time which represents good and which is evil. The Queen makes her grand entrance on top of a Mark V tank and begs Tamino to rescue her daughter, Pamino (Amy Carson) who is being held prisoner in the fortress of Sarastro. Tamino and Papageno set off to rescue her, but it is soon apparent that in this magic world few things are what they seem ...

Director Kenneth Branagh, who co-wrote the screenplay with Stephen Fry, has removed most of Mozart's masonic symbolism, though not quite all, and replaced it with imagery reflecting the horror and waste of war. Stephen Fry produced a new English libretto to reflect this. For example, the song which in the original has the lyrics ""O Isis and Osiris"" has been given completely new words to fit a commemoration of the dead, which is taking place in a war cemetary, with a message pleading for peace.

One aspect which has been changed hardly at all is Papageno's desperate desire to find the girl of his dreams, Papagena (Silvia Moi) and their eventual meeting is brilliantly funny.

""The Magic Flute"" contains perhaps the most beautiful song ever written for the human voice, the Queen of the Night's aria, which in context is also one of the most shocking things ever written. I presume Lyubov Petrova must have first recorded this in a studio and then mimed to her own voice while filming: both her singing and acting are first rate, and this scene is both psychedelic and truly horrifying.

Nobody with more imagination than a stone ever forgets the first time they see this aria performed in context and those watching this DVD who have not previously seen a stage or film version of ""The Magic Flute"" will find it no exception - it will sear itself into your memory.

Parts of the opera, like the original, are pretty nonsensical, but it worked for me. The singing, both from the main performers and the backing from the Chorus Apollo Voices, was excellent throughout, as was the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Special Effects were very cleverly done.

I agree with those reviewers who thought that subtitles would have been useful: the male performers were without exception easy to follow and I didn't have too much difficulty making out what Amy Carson as Pamina or Silvia Moi as Papagena were singing. However, Mozart's music, beautiful as it is, makes extreme demands on the voice in certain places, particularly for the Queen of the Night and the three ladies, and there were certainly sections where I had difficulty making out the new words which Stephen Fry had written for these characters.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed this version. If you are a fan of Mozart in general or the Magic Flute in particular, buy or rent this, and I think you are most unlikely to regret it.",1273622400,43,4105,4.712691771269177
3347637,5,B0013JG7IQ,"Based on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's final opera, ""Die Zauberflote,"" renowned actor-writer-director Kenneth Branagh's film is a visual wonder and a musical triumph in every sense of the words. Sadly, this beautiful movie is not available in Region 1, but it should be seen everywhere, and appreciated. For me, it off-sets the semi-disappointment I feel of his remake of ""Sleuth."" The acting, cinematography and everything else was top-notch. I highly recommend this movie, and would rate it PG for mild violence, both war-related and comic. I have a feeling that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart would be proud of this film version of one of his most popular operas.",1255132800,12,655,5.188679245283019
8251291,5,B0013JG7IQ,This is not your average opera production. It takes Mozart's innovative and timeless music and puts in an unexpected setting. The WWI setting does both the play and the history it is referencing justice.,1510099200,,203,5.0
8251292,4,B0013JG7IQ,"I offer my 4-star recommendation of this film with a modest suggestion: appreciate it for its own unique qualities, without comparing it unfavorably to other productions. Branagh sets the action in an era similar to World War I, and within that scenario he finds many brilliantly inventive ways to bring out the whimsy, the menace, the surreality and the seriousness that Mozart's music and Schikaneder's libretto dreamed-up in their creation of Die Zauberflte. The roles are excellently cast, the sets and costumes are cleverly done, the cinematography is nicely accomplished, and the opera is well performed. (By the way, if you wonder how much you might like this adaptation of The Magic Flute, you can actually preview the entire film on YouTube, though in a lower resolution than what you will find on this DVD.)
I think it would be impossible to produce a ""best"" or ""definitive"" performance of Die Zauberflte, simply because it is so rich in interpretive possibilities. Ultimately, though, I consider Branagh's version -- with its charming English translation by Stephen Fry -- to be quite satisfying.",1503100800,,1107,5.155555555555556

8251295,5,B0013JG7IQ,"I was a public school music teacher for four years, so I like to think I know a little something about music.  But first, for an opera, it's well-staged.  It's sung in English, and, if you order the online version, you get English subtitles, although some of the words do not have subtitles.  I think that you'll find the opera easy to understand, even though some conventions take a little getting used to.  The singing is great, the music magnificent, and the actors and actresses look the part (that was Kenneth Branagh's requirement).

This is a ""rom-com"" opera that espouses ideals.  That's because, like many in his day, Mozart was enamored with Masonic principles.",1478908800,,671,4.842105263157895
