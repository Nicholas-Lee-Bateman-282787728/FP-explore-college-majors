8432141,5,B004K3HFUG,I am a certified labor doula and doula educator.  This is my second copy of this video.  I show it at prenatal visits to prepare clients for labor and to give an example of positions that we may be using in labor.  The positions that it shows are positions that are regularly used for client comfort in labor and birth.,1405209600,2,319,4.283333333333333

8432145,4,B004K3HFUG,Simple and to the point good demonstrations ... a few positions were repeated for different stages of labor... that was just a little redundant but for the most part I was pleased,1298851200,5,179,4.625
