3730777,5,B001OMZYHC,"The series does start out slow but picks up later.  The first part indroduces you to characters, backgrounds, concepts, and you start to dip your foot into the plot.  Later on, you're fully submerged into the plot and you cling to the end of your seat waiting for what comes next.  Fights don't drag on forever but don't end too quickly.  It's filled with lots of action, some dark stories, and humor that will have you laughing out loud.

I love the charaters in D. Gray-Man.  They range so much and have so much personality to them.  You get to know both bad and good guys and love them both, even the Earl.

I recommend this series to everyone.",1234656000,8,647,4.378151260504202
3730778,5,B001OMZYHC,"If Tim Burton were ever to attempt a steampunk horror story, then I imagine the results would be something like ""D.Gray-man.""

And the first thirteen episodes of this gothic, deeply quirky anime attempts just that kind of atmosphere. ""D.Grayman: Season 1 Part 1"" starts off relatively slowly as it introduces the main storyline, the akuma and the sweet-natured Allan Walker. But the story really blossoms as our likable, haunted hero begins his new life among other exorcists.

Two cops are investigating an abandoned church when Officer Moore encounters a strange boy with a deformed hand, Allen Walker. After her partner is killed, Allen manages to save Moore from an akuma -- an enslaved human soul under the control of the evil Millennium Earl. When Allen is placed under house arrest in Moore's home, he reveals that the akuma is nearby... and its origins lie in a horrific tragedy from Moore's own past. Only Allen can stop it.

Later Allen arrives at the clifftop Exorcist Headquarters to introduce himself as an official exorcist. But things don't go very smoothly -- he's mistaken for a spy, the exorcists are weirdos, and the place is governed by mad genius Komui and eerie Hevlaska. But Allen finds out just what ""Innocence"" is, and why the exorcists are racing to find it.

His first missions are no less stressful: first Allen is called to accompany antisocial swordsman Kanda to an abandoned city haunted by a ""ghost""... and a shapeshifting akuma. And he encounters a young boy determined to fight the akuma, but unaware that someone close to him is one -- and a face-to-face encounter with the Earl reveals the horrifying reason Allen became an exorcist.

Then Komui's sister Lenalee is sent with Allen to a town that is repeating the same day over and over -- and only the pitiful Miranda Lotto notices. But their mission is complicated by a mysterious human girl who has come to locate the hidden Innocence... and take it for the Earl.

Cyborg demons, cross-embedded magic arms, virus-filled biobullets, giant glowing worms with collagen lips, and a mountain fortress filled with eccentric exorcists out to save the world from a grinning, rotund demon who looks like a Blue Meanie and may (or may not) have rabbit ears. Yup, ""D.Gray-man"" is not your typical manga series, even as quirky horror goes.

And ""D.Grayman: Season 1 Part 1"" does an excellent job sticking to Hoshino Katsura's manga series, introducing a gothic Victorian world and introducing the akuma, the Earl, and the exorcists. It also lays the groundwork for what the Earl's plans are, and what the exorcists are doing. It's a pretty standard ""get the artifacts before the bad guys do"" goal, but with a couple interesting twists.

And along the way, we're given plenty of explosive, horrific action with macabre creatures, graveyards, little shadowy towns, and the tragic, horrific origins of the akuma. But lest the series become too grim, we get plenty of funny stuff as well -- including an entire episode devoted to Komui's deranged robot rampaging through Headquarters, trying to operate on the exorcists.

Allen is a pretty endearing hero from the start -- polite, apologetic, selfless and courageous, even when people are nasty to him. But he becomes truly striking character it's shown how got his cursed eye, white hair, and ability to kill akuma. He's backed by a solid supporting cast -- the snotty Kanda, sweet-natured Lenalee, eccentric Komui and frenetically depressed Miranda. And the Earl is a very creepy villain -- not just because he wants to kill God, but because he smiles cheerfully even as he destroys people.

""D.Grayman: Season 1 Part 1"" has a few episodes that don't quite reach ""superb,"" but it's an excellent start to an outstanding anime series. Absolutely brilliant -- and promises to get even better.",1230681600,26,3814,4.963949843260188

3730827,4,B001OMZYHC,"First off, I love anime but I get tired of seeing this computer animated drawn stuff where characters have cooked macaroni looking elbow and leg joints----I love the Berserk style hand drawn characters (I know those days are gone, but I gotta rant okay?).  However, D gray man does do a nice job of having a darker/suspenseful looking series going on.  I didn't care for this show for the first few episodes, then it started to grow on me and now I do in fact think others should see this series.  What is great about this show?  The main character has a very nice group of SUPPORTING characters!  A huge plus!  If you like Inuyasha, then you may enjoy this---as both series have a great group of people to surround the main character.  I'd say this isn't a five star series---but it ranks a good 4 star ranking for me.  One place this series takes a hit for me is Allan's sidekick, Tim Campi---seems relatively weak as, well, being in the story.  He doesn't do much--kinda like a paper weight--Does he serve a purpose, yes he does.  But compared to other minor supporting allies in other shows--like Kirara in Inyuasha or Ichigo's Zanpakto in Bleach----Tim Campi falls very very short.  That is, unless he does something super huge later on but I have only made it as far as the end of season 2 part 2.  So I hope you check this out, it is worth seeing.  :)",1293494400,,1358,4.42741935483871
3730828,4,B001OMZYHC,"This series is a mix of supernatural and horror genres with a religious underscore. A teenager named Allen Walker, has been training with an expert Exorcist in order to become an Exorcist himself, a person who is specially skilled and capable of fighting against an evil being known as The Millennium Earl.

The Millennium Earl's insane goal is to destroy the human race in order to bring the world to it's death.

The story centers around Allen , who has joined up with an order of Exorcists called The Black Order, going on various missions for the purpose of retrieving a rare powerful mineral substance called Innocence. This substance is scattered in various deposits around the world.  ""Finders"", specially trained people who are trackers working for the Exorcists, locate the substance where ever it may be, then guard it until an Exorcist can arrive to take possesion of it.  Innocence contains mystical properties allowing the Exorcists to use it to give themselves supernatural strength and weapons in their struggle to stop the Earl.  On his missions Allen encounters and battles various ""Akuma"" entities, these are minions of the Earl who are bio-mechanical monsters, each powered by a tormented human soul trapped inside them.  This is relevent to the key point of the story, the search for the substance called Innocence, because only a weapon that is powered by Innocence can free a soul from its imprisonment inside the Akuma.  The Akuma are created and sent by the Earl to try to collect and destroy the Innocence substance before the Exorcists can get hold of it.

I've viewed a lot of Anime series and movies, from humor to horror and everything in between.  I know what I like and what I don't like.  And, I initially had mixed feelings about this series.  Technically, the level of detail in the animation itself is impressive, perhaps among some of the best animation ever produced, but the story seemed overly complicated, the characters initially are underdeveloped and difficult to sympathize with, the initial battles are poorly choreographed making it difficult to follow the action.

I was sorely disappointed in this series while viewing the first three episodes.  There was no explanation of the characters, no understanding of the enemies that appeared, and the action moved so quickly during fights that it was almost impossible to determine who was doing what.

I was about to give up on this series , but I held on for episode four ( part of a sequence of episodes called The Ghost of Mater )and suddenly the pace seemed to settle down a bit, the characters became more fleshed out emotionally and the story became more focused on the events at hand, and even the battles became better paced. This segment ended in episode 5 ( called..., Let Me Hear The Lullaby )with a very dramatic and emotionally moving scene where Allen defends a ""doll"" powered with a heart made from the Innocence substance against his own fellow Exorcist, Kanda, who wants to take the heart from her, and against the Akuma monster who has been tracking them.  The series suddenly seems to grow up and get serious at this point and becomes much better from then on.

The disks worked flawlessy, the video and audio were excellent.  Overall, I recommend the series. You need to be patient through the first few episodes to get to where the characters and story become better developed, but it's worth the relatively short wait and the watching.

3730829,4,B001OMZYHC,"In 2004, mangaka Katsura Hoshino's ""D. Gray-Man"" was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine with 19 manga collected manga volumes currently released.

With the manga series popularity, in 2006, ""D. Gray-Man"" received its anime adaptation and in three years, a total of 103 episodes were featured in Japan on TV Tokyo and also received various video game series, soundtracks and also novels.

FUNimation Entertainment began releasing the series in the US via 13-episode volumes on DVD (with the most recent release being the season two part two) and now the first 13 episodes (season one part one) is being released on Blu-ray.

""D. Gray-Man"" focuses on the 15-year-old character, Allen Walker, who is an exorcist who works for the Black Order, an organization that is trying to stop the main antagonist Millennium Earl.  Earl wants to destroy humanity by creating an army of akuma.  What Earl does is go to those who grieve for a love one that passed away and asks them if they want to see their love one alive and if they do, they just have to call out the deceased one's name.

In this case, Earl brings up this metal skeleton in which the soul of the dead comes alive and takes over the metal skeleton that are now akuma.  Earl then urges for these akuma to kill the person that wished them back and take over their body in order to inflict more harm on humanity.

It is the job of the exorcists to stop these akuma and kill them but for Allen, unlike others who work for the Black Order, he understands their anguish of being revived to kill and having no control over what they do.  Allen knows this from experience as he was tricked by Earl when he was young and ended up bringing his dead father Mana back to life as an akuma.  And Mana cursing Allen with an eye that can detect and see the anguish of the soul that inhabits an akuma body.

Along with others in the Black Order, Allen learns through his visits to various villages of the evil of Millennium Earl but also that he has others working for him.  And a race is on for both sides to look for 109 pieces of the ""Innocence"" which can be turned into anti-akuma weapons that the exorcist need to fight Earl and his akuma, while Earl wants these pieces to make sure that he can destroy them.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""D. Gray-Man: Season One Part One"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (169).  Overall, picture quality varies from episode-to-episode.  The animation and character designs are well-done.  I actually like how the characters are animated and although not a vibrant anime series (since a lot of the scenes take place indoors or during the night time, especially with a foggy atmosphere), there are colors that come out from the various visual effects from the red that comes off of Allen's eye to the green light aura around his arm, the blue of Yu's innocence sword or the orange and red from explosions and fire.

Part of the problem that I found is that the discoloration problems that were evident on ""Samurai Champloo"", ""Basilisk"" and several recent Blu-ray releases shows up.  During closeups of a face, you can see these green splotchiness surrounding the faces of the characters.  But it is important to note that the splotchiness and artifacting is not as evident as the two series mentioned but it does show up from time-t0-time. But because of this, I'm guessing that for this Blu-ray release, the video is an upconvert.

As for the audio, ""D. Gray-Man: Season One Part One"" is featured in Dolby TrueHD English 5.1.  Dialogue is clear as it comes from the center channel, music and special effects from the front channels.  During the more intense action scenes, good use of the booming effects as the bass is nice and punchy from the subwoofer and sound effects are strong coming from the surround channels. So, for the most part, lossless English track is pretty solid.  Voice acting was also very well-done on the English dub track as well.

As for the Japanese track, on the back of the package it says that the audio is Dolby TrueHD 2.0 but when you see the menu of the disc, it is Dolby Digital 2.0 and the signal coming from the player and receiver shows it as Dolby Digital, so it's a missprint on the rear packaging.

I did enjoy the Japanese vocal track and for those who prefer watching their anime in Japanese, if you have a modern home theater receiver and a good 5.1, 7.2 or higher setup, you can have a more immersive setup by setting audio to come out on all channels.  But it is important to note that the Japanese audio track is not lossless and I'm sure that anime Blu-ray fans who were excited about a Japanese lossless soundtrack may have issue with this.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""D. Gray-Man: Season One, Part One"" comes with the following special features:

  * Episode 2 Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for episode 2 by Asst. ADR Director and voice actor (for Allen Walker) Todd Haberkorn and Luci Christian (voice actress of Lenalee Lee).  Todd talks about the episode and being a voice actor trying out for a role and Luci Christian talks about being a writer and voice actress for the series.
  * Textless Opening and Ending Theme - Textless themes for Abingdon Boys School's ""Innocent Sorrow"" and the ending theme ""Snow Kiss"" by NIRGILIS.
  * Trailers - Featuring FUNimation Entertainment trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""D. Gray-Man"" so far is an entertaining anime series.  It happens to also be the longest anime series out on Blu-ray in the US and with over a hundred episodes, it's going to take some dedication to follow the series with each volume only containing 13-episodes.

In some way, I found ""D. Gray-Man"" as appealing as ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" but with only 13-episodes so far, it's too early to tell how the overall season progresses.  One thing that I did enjoy about this TV series is that each episode is connected and there are not as many filler episodes.  One thing that tends to drag a series is too many stand-alone episodes and the good news about ""D. Gray-Man"" is that there is always an episode arc in regards to Allen's missions, so that was quite a positive.

Character-wise, so far I've enjoyed the supporting characters such as Lenalee Lee, Yu Kanda, Komui and a few others.  Although, I wonder if the entire series primarily focuses on Allen (which it does so far) and if Lenalee will have her own episodes further into the series.  I also enjoyed the character designs and also the costume designs of the characters.  So, my first impression plot-wise is that for the first 13-episodes, so far, so good.

As for the Blu-ray release, I know that there are people who may be dissatisfied that there is no Japanese Dolby TrueHD soundtrack despite the package displaying a lossless soundtrack but I will say the English lossless soundtrack was very good and well-acted, also there is good use of the surround channels and the subwoofer during the action sequences.

There are not as many special features included on this Blu-ray release and it would have been good to have a few more commentary tracks instead of just the one for episode 2.

Again, it's important to emphasize that ""D. Gray-Man"" is a 103-episode TV series, so it is a much longer series compared to the average 13 to 26-episode anime TV series.  I do wish there was 26-episodes included on each Blu-ray release but with this series being released not long after the DVD release in the US (and is still being released in the US at this time), I can understand.

So, before stepping into ""D. Gray-Man"", you may want to make sure you are committed to staying the course of purchasing multiple volumes of this series on Blu-ray.  Overall, I found ""D. Gray-Man"" to be an entertaining series thus far and is another anime TV series worth adding to your anime on Blu-ray collection.",1262822400,9,7815,4.6574344023323615
3730830,5,B001OMZYHC,"I saw the first 100 or so episodes of this series when it aired in Japan. The show is super addictive and fun for both male and female viewers.

The basic plot is that the evil Earl of the Millennium tricks people into creating demons by preying on their grief when they lose a loved one. A group called the ""Black Order"" has a bunch of field agents with special powers, known as ""exorcists."" These exorcists try to slay the demons and defeat the Earl. Lots of great fight scenes and an intriguing supernatural storyline with plenty of plot twists.

For anime fans, it's kind of like Fullmetal Alchemist meets Bleach.

The reason I suggest renting the episodes first (from, e.g., Netflix) is that this set has 13 episodes, and if you like the show, this is a really expensive way to watch the 100 episodes. Also, in later episodes as the show got really popular, they started to do a one-manga-to-one-episode conversion, so the later episodes contain significantly less plot than the earlier episodes. When one battle takes three episodes, it can be frustrating to watch, even though after reaching that point you just want to keep watching and find out what happens (!) So you'll probably have just as much fun following the series by renting it, and then buying it when it comes out on a cheaper, more consolidated collection like they've done with Death Note.

All in all I really enjoyed this series! It's a lot of fun, has great and much-beloved characters, and is definitely worth watching if you like action anime with supernatural elements.",1262649600,2,1548,4.722222222222222
