8546412,1,B000UNYJ86,"Unless you are a die hard fan of Marilyn Manson, I would not advise purchasing this DVD. This is the poorest quality concert footage that I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. During ""The Beautiful People"" portion of this DVD, viewers are subjected to watching a cartoonish light show which was completely irrelevant. Very disappointing to say the least. I am assuming that this is an unauthorized DVD because there is no way that the band would put this out for the public to see.",1211760000,9,490,4.709302325581396
