5967933,5,B00F5K1Z40,I watched this show when it came online awhile back(never watched the first one) I highly enjoyed it (this is the type of show I can watch again and again ;-) ). So I would recommend it but my issue with it was the dub. Now I usually will watch the dub more than the subtitle but for some reason this I did not like. One thing I to translate from Japanese to English some words will be different that is perfectly fine but they can do without the cursing (I know I sound like a prude) but it was not in the Japanese version so why in this one (are they trying to be cool or something ?) love the show but this one play the original version. P.S. About me being a prude I am probely older than most of the people buying it(been a fan since robotech(when it first came out here when I was a kid) I just don't like cursing,1386892800,4,819,3.9696969696969697

8612471,4,B00F5K1Z40,"I preface this with a remark that it covers both halves of the season, because, if you liked the first season, (I got in in the S.A.V.E. bundle, so all 26 episodes) you'll want both halves on hand, because it's not two separate arcs, but one full 26 episode arc, and the 13 leaves you on a decent sized cliffhanger.

It follows it's predecessor in the same vein, that of ""Same story, different time"" picking up as part three of the 12,000 year cycle of major, earth shattering events.  It is the same base formula: mysterious enemies abducting people for their cause, and you get to discover it over the course of the series.  Again, like before, there are the chief characters whom the main story hinges upon, but the supporting cast is interesting and gets their time to shine a bit as well, and are not just throwaways to flesh out the mains.  There are even two sub romance plots between supporting characters, which are well done and possibly more charming then the main love quadrangle.  (Although, it is possible that there is a fourth, very satisfying love hint in the final moment, that adds a nice dose of closure to the mythos of the show.

As for the action content, like the first series, there are healthy doses of combat, both outside and inside the robots, broken up with some heavy exposition at times.  It's a little less of the formulaic build of the first, with the ""first half of an episode: learn some lesson, second half: robot battle featuring what the character just learned.""  There is still an element of that, but situations flow into one another a bit more fluidly, there is more slapstick, more character interaction, and less reliance on the whole ""History repeating"" part.  The overall structure has the same ""puppet master"" type vibe, but is not carried to the extent of other anime like ""Robotics: notes.""  But, some of the revelations and places where plotlines intersect give satisfying ""Ah-ha"" moments.

What I feel the series does best, is connect itself to it's original, in parts, almost like an homage.  The lore developed in the first carries over heavily, sometimes clearly, sometimes with much fog, distorting what had been established fact into the stuff of myth and half remembered fable, all to great effect.  This is especially evident as the main cast members are introduced and their histories and motivations are established.

I watched in Dub, and I think it was a well done Dub, with some of Funimations staple actors/actresses very well cast, and the voice work conforming with the first series dubbing in a satisfying, and occasionally plot relevant way.  Previous voices like Christopher Bevins, Brina Palencia, Eric Vale, and Brandon Potter are terrific, along with additions like Alexis Tippton and a larger part for Luci Christian (in her Nagisa Voice, no less) make the dub a pleasure.

I will admit, the tone set in the first handful of episodes does seem to fly in the face of the first series, but once the show hits its groove, it fits well, in a higher energy pace that shows it's just as unafraid to throw around innuendo, kill a few characters here or there, feature lots of play for donuts, and insert just as many crazy, random, confusing metaphors that sound philosophical.

Overall, if you enjoyed the first, and want a funny, charming, occasionally odd, and generally well done story with satisfying b and c plots, this show does it well.",1423353600,,3410,4.772108843537415

8612475,5,B00F5K1Z40,"Aquarion EvoL was one of my favorite anime series I watched for 2013.  It is the sequel to the  Aquarion anime and it was worth the wait.  I remembered watching the first aquarion on Netflix and I liked it.  The characters, the cgi used for the mecha, the story, especially the music.  I gave this anime five out of five because I am a fan of the original series. I recommend this anime for lovers of mech anime or sci-fi anime.",1389052800,8,428,4.234567901234568
8612476,5,B00F5K1Z40,a good start to the second season with a pretty decent dub unfortunately the fanbase is small and like the previous season it falls victim to the same stupid complaints and snide comments as the first season from people who don't even bother to watch past the first episode. regardless the second season is off to a good start looking forward to the release of the second half,1389052800,5,376,4.544117647058823
