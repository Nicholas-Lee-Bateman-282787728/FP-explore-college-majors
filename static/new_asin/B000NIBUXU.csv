2768932,2,B000NIBUXU,"I picked this anime up for two reasons.  I've watched enough anime now to realize that I really do like a lot of it and I've studied a lot of ancient Sumerian/Mesopotamian history, which naturally leads to the reading of Gilgamesh.  I was really curious to see what capacity that would be included in this anime.  Gilgamesh does not take place in the ancient past but in the future and has more of a science fiction feel to it.

Gilgamesh is a very bleakly animated series.  I say that because everything seems to be dark all the time and has a seemingly gothic element thrown into the artistic feel.  Gilgamesh is centered on a catastrophic event that happened called ""twin x"" or XX.  Strangely the series actually seems to be set in the Middle East, but it looks more like a regular modern city setting than any kind of Arabic element.  Basically they found the tomb of Gilgamesh and it turns out the original tale of him being part god was true because for whatever reason it's giving off these special properties.  So naturally a group of special scientists are pulled together to research this phenomenon under a corporate entity called Heaven's Gate.  However, something starts to go wrong where a new life form appears in some strange test chamber.  They call it Tear and it seems fairly benign, but one scientist projects that it will cause a catastrophe and no one listens to him.  As a parallel to the story his nickname is Enkidu.  Anyway, the last thing we see of him is that he's going into the chamber and about to come in contact with Tear when everything just explodes.  It sends of this burst of radiation or something into the sky and turns the sky this shimmering color that has strange magnetic properties.  The end result is that computers and other kinds of technology will no longer work.  So after humanity has gotten fairly dependent on these elements they are forced to try and live without them.  That's basically the entire setting we are brought into and all the above explained in pretty much the first episode.

The story really takes place a decent amount of time after twin X.  The story centers on the children of Enkidu who lost their father in the accident and lost their mother shortly thereafter.  So now they have nowhere to go.  They stumble upon a group of children, ages fourteen and up, that have something to do with Gilgamesh and exhibit telekinetic abilities.  Then some other children appear and start fighting with them.  These other kids also have telekinetic powers, so there seems to be some kind of strange war.  Ultimately the two children that are related to Enkidu end up in the hands of these other people and they live with this lady called the Countess who used to work at Heaven's Gate.  It's a strange story and has a lot of twists.  It actually has a lot of the thematic feel of a post-apocalyptic story, but actually isn't.  It's pre-apocalyptic, but it feels post apocalyptic because people feel very isolated and humanity is struggling to continue on with life after they no longer have connection with the rest of the world at their fingertips.  I thought the story was very well designed in that element alone.  I found the characters very well developed overall and enough well written plot twists to be very intrigued by a lot of the conclusions to the questions the viewer develops throughout the series.  In some ways the story is very well written and in others it kind of isn't, like you never really grasp why the kids have those special powers... or maybe I just missed it.  The real black mark on this series is that the story ends very poorly in my opinion.  I like how it ended, I just disliked why it ended that way.

The art is pretty good for the most part.  One small part that kind of threw me off artistically is that they made a careful effort to give all their characters lips so they look more realistic.  Now normally I would say this is a great idea, especially since I collect a lot of comic books and most of that art includes that feature of realism.  I don't know why, but seeing it used in an anime made it feel less usual, I've already gotten used to the tiny mouth aspect of anime.  I really just think it looks better because with lips the faces seem crowded to me for some reason, their mouths just look far too big.  I don't know, it's a very odd reason to knock this series, but it was a stylistic element that I didn't like.  Everything else was beautifully done and artistically they really capture that very bleak feel, which I suppose is sort of a foreshadowing artistic element since it's pre-apocalyptic.

I really did want to like this anime a ton.  It had all the elements that I would seemingly enjoy.  Extremely dark atmosphere, human society struggling to survive, accurate ancient historical representations... I really did try to get into it.  As you can see by my rating it didn't really succeed.  It has a lot of interesting elements and asks really tough moral/ethical questions which I usually love on a philosophical level.  There's just something about Gilgamesh that didn't follow through with a major revelation.  I suppose that's not accurate, there is a major revelation, but it's kind of stupid.  This series did not end on a high note for me and instead tries to teach something about love in the end.  For such a bleakly designed series this just felt like a rip off.  Unfortunately I don't think this has very much re-watch value for me.  It's like a few other series I've encountered that start off strong but just taper off in the end.  While Gilgamesh does some things right it really doesn't hold together fully for me, so I wouldn't recommend to rush out and get it.  It is kind of worth watching once because a lot of it is pretty good, but the conclusion will ultimately kill the high in the end.",1218931200,5,5829,4.56111645813282
2768933,5,B000NIBUXU,"Being a long-time anime fan, and having watched a LOT of the good, the bad and the horrible animes out there (say hello to ""So Long Mr Despair""!), I was not expecting much from Gilgamesh. I was picking through the online bin on a website's big ADV Films sale (25 volumes of anime for $100 -- free shipping! how can you go wrong??) and stumbled upon Gilgamesh. Having always been interested in mythology all over the world and needing to fill up my shopping basket, I decided to pick up all the volumes I could of what the site had in stock. It sat on my shelf with the rest of my anime for about 2 months, then one day I was bored and picked it up.

Wow. I thought I knew what I was in for when it came to this anime, but apparently not! It will mess with your mind, make you question every character...and in the end you will sit back and wonder ""Where did my brain go?"" I completely loved this anime!! There are a few obscure references in it, and you really need to pay a lot of attention in order to understand it completely -- or watch it multiple times. The story unfolds in a very helter-skelter fashion, but in the end...all of the pieces fall into place, an most of it makes sense. All of the voice actors and actresses were very well thought out and are perfect for their parts -- in English and Japanese. So, I highly recommend this anime if you are older (17+ maybe? for themes and such) and like noir-style stories and anime that will leave you thinking, then watch Gilgamesh!!",1215648000,9,1490,4.265017667844523
2768934,2,B000NIBUXU,"Gilgamesh is an interesting experiment in the post apocalyptic anime genre. It sets a dark depressing mood. It's use of classical music is a little out of the norm and the animation style is a little unusual but I didn't have any problems with either. There are many interesting ideas in the plot and the story telling but I don't think that they work in the end and I found the middle to be a chore to get through since so little actually happens and the characters are not interesting or easy to identify with. Everyone seems to be waiting for someone else to do something. There are problems with pacing. The series needs to be told slowly and deliberately to achieve its goal but there is just too much time where nothing happens, too many inconclusive battles and it goes from still to boring. The story would probably have been better at half its current length.

You should note that despite what panopticon7 says about extensive features this is the thinpak version with no special features aside from some previews. He obviously got a different boxset packaged with the very well done single release volumes.",1209168000,3,1117,4.698979591836735
2768935,2,B000NIBUXU,"First let me say: Gilgamesh is an anime that promises much but never delivers.  The animation style is unique, but there are many glitches and often the animation quality dips when the view is farther away.

The ending is the worst of the show, without giving anything away, watch Wolf's Rain or Ergo Proxy, the endings are similar but MUCH better.  The writing bogs down in many areas.

I was intrigued after the first few episodes but the story just falls apart from the second disc onward.  We see a bunch of angst ridden children attempting to discover their heritage.  More often, the children sit around fuming.  By the end, we see 10 Gilgamesh, but really only know one or two.

Pros: Interesting concept
Cons: animation, story, characters

Viewing preference: Japanese with English subs",1206748800,5,794,4.865671641791045
2768936,1,B000NIBUXU,"I have just finished watching this anime, and I cannot do anything else but to express my deepest criticism for this anime serie.

Animation: I usually do not bother much with animation, since I think that a good thought up story can well compensate for bad graphics. In this anime however, I was somehow confused, since really all animes are drawn somewhat ugly. They have some beautiful feats, but except for Kyoko (the sister) all other characters just have many flaws which don't stem from chracater, but from drawing.

Music: It was not that bad. The only thing which I definetly didn't like about it, was that the same music get's replayed over and over the entire anime. After the 5th episode or so, you get quite bored about it.

Story: Well, the most important point for any anime, movie or book. A story makes or brakes a story-telling medium after all. In this case, it did the latter. The story does start somewhat interesting, with a giagantic desaster, where the sky is transformed into some sort of mirror.

At first, I thought this a good idea. My initial idea was that this would go into a direction similar to ""Wonderful Days"", where the main characters simply seek out the old blue sky.

The story, however, quickly steered into another direction, as the characters encounter strange demons and psychics batteling one another, each acting like they are the good guys.

From that point onward, the story doesn't really progress. It just jumps back and forth. An organisation tries to bring back the blue sky, and fails after suceeding for a little while. There are some would-be love affairs, and some pseudo-philosophical questions raised, but that doesn't make the anime any better.

I still watched trough the entire anime, in the hopes that it would get somewhat better. I was totally disappointed.
The anime creates more and more ""revelations"" towards the end, and each one is even more ridiculous than the last one, and causes more and more headaches.

Finally, the end of the story really went past everything I had imagined a bad ending. It was horrible. In structure it somewhat resembles ""The end of evangelion"", which I couldn't find any better. Since I do not want to spoil anything here, I will not go into further detail. Suffice to say that the ending was horribly bad.

I brought the DVD back the same day I watched the last episode, and asked for my money back.

If you too value a good, passionate and interesting story, then please do not buy this anime, since it can only be considered a complete waste.",1204934400,4,2541,4.728506787330317
2768937,3,B000NIBUXU,"This anime makes great use of classical music to set moods, mostly the happy ones.  The drawing style makes the characters seem more gritty, more hard.  And generally the coloring scheme makes everything dark.  The character development for the kids at the hotel is much thorough than with Hayato Kazmatsuri or the members of Gilgamesh.  The cover text about picking a side is rather pointless with the poor character development of the people in the other groups.

I would probably draw parallels with ""Evangelion"", ""Now and Then, Here and There"", and ""Texhnolyze.""  I also think there's quite a lot in common with ""Zardoz"", though the perspective is different.

The anime is pretty dark.  Might be worth a rental.  Once you know the plot, the replay value greatly diminishes.  The lack of character development for more of the characters greatly hinders wanting to watch it many times.  The ending seems rushed and most of the realizations aren't so shocking, especially with the muted emotional atmosphere of the anime.",1199318400,13,1022,5.059880239520958
2768938,5,B000NIBUXU,"engaging characters, a complex story, and truly singular cinematic flourishes never before seen in anime, gilgamesh is a quiet watershed in serial animation. the character design, art design, score, sound, direction and cinematographic choices, and particularly the voice work are all exemplary. and i want to stress the voice work. this is quality stuff. well done all the way around.

this is a series for adults. morally ambiguous, subtle and nuanced narrative threads weave a slowly constricting net that envelopes, with the smallest details informing both moments of intimacy and reflection and moments of intrigue and revelation, in a constant series of graduating payoffs leading to an operatic conclusion.

it's not for everyone: it's not bright primary colors, it's not pleasantly simplistic, it's not comforting repetition of everything ever done and it's not a paint by numbers formula; this is an intricate tableau explosively revealed here punctuated by a disturbing coda, and its rewards are many and varied for the casual viewer as well as the close reading fan. this is lush and densely layered work. mature things are done. mature things are said. this is art and it means something. for everyone else, there is always Fullmetal Alchemist or Dragon Ball Z or even Pokemon.

the dvd boxed set is worth its price; this is something to savor and share with others. and the extras are many and unique: extensive and well-shot actor interviews and behind the scenes documentaries; production art; the score on a separate track; the director of the american cast reading his production journal--giving an insider's view as to exactly how the business works and what the process of producing an anime for american release entails; a glossary that serves as a debriefing and an expansion of the world you just witnessed, with reference to the original manga. more.

this is a high water mark in the industry--in execution, in production and in release. there just isn't anything out there like this. but after this forceful vision and realization? there will be.

(post script--June 7, 2008--there is only one boxed edition of gilgamesh. it is the only one amazon carries. it has all the features i have described. if you do not have the full featured discs, you are in possession of a pirated copy.)",1189814400,15,2309,5.08179419525066
2768939,4,B000NIBUXU,I loved the storyline no matter how weird it was. The one thing is they put as much of the episodes as they could into one dvd as possible and takeing out the other things you usally find in a dvd. Not that i completely mind i just liked to have seen other stuff besides just the episodes on the dvd. Other then that its perfectly fine with me.,1187827200,6,344,4.0
2768940,5,B000NIBUXU,"This is serious sci-fi with a gothic flavor.  The story is complex and slowly builds to the earth shattering finale'.  The characters are fairly straightforward but the story line is twisted enough to more than make up for any lack of character development.  A quick A to Z on the story.  An archeological find leads to an earth wide disaster.  In the world that follows, two factions do battle... one side employs extra dimensional demonic creatures while the other super powered youngsters who have been purchased by a wealthy duchess.  A third force becomes apparent as the story develops and things quickly dissolve into a free for all.  Hard to believe people still call this type of anime ""cartoon"".  Well written and adequately animated, Gilgamesh will thrill and delight any fan of sci-fi and anime.",1184371200,6,807,4.925925925925926

This is the Best SLEPT on ANIME Ever...Anyone who watch this will be overwhelmed with great illustration, story plot, and action.  The first 2 episodes get ya going with uhhh maybe I made a mistake but towards the middle and end of the 2nd episode you're like OH MY GOD I WANT MORE!  Clones with TELEKENTIC powers others that can transform their physical being.  I don't want to spoil it as to why I'm only giving you hints here and there...You don't know me but TRUST ME!

8177813,4,B000NIBUXU,"I don't know why some people gave Gilgamesh one or two stars... there is absolutely nothing about this anime that deserves that little credit. Yes, it takes a certain type of person to be really into Gilgamesh, but even so, the dark, gothic motif of this series is totally different and unique that it deserves at least a 3. I think, if you are aspiring to be experienced in anime, you should definitely have Gilgamesh in your record.",1323216000,,434,4.576923076923077
8177814,5,B000NIBUXU,"If the 1940's and 1950's were the Golden Age of cartoons, Gilgamesh proves that contemporary anime cartoons are in their renaissance. Gilgamesh combines just about everything that I like about anime: beautiful art, creative plot, great characters with human emotion, and a wonderful soundtrack.

For those unfamiliar with the series, Gilgamesh is the story of two orphan siblings living in a post apocalyptic world, which their father destroyed. Soon they are approached by 2 battling forces, who both claim to be saving the world; the fate of the world depends on which side they choose.

Like most anime, you have to watch about 3 episodes before you realize what's really happening with the plot. For some, this series may move too slow, but I enjoy a slowly unraveling plot, and this one keeps you guessing till the end. I don't understand the low reviews: Gilgamesh is one of the best anime I have seen since ""scrapped princess"". I liked different style of anime in this series (the eyes have so much emotion). The ending while sad, was also incredibly rewarding and fitting.",1248307200,16,1080,4.928571428571429
8177815,3,B000NIBUXU,"Gilgamesh brings back a feeling of nostalgia to the new anime community.  It was very similar to classics like Evangelion.  Now to separate this review into the pros and cons of Gilgamesh:

Positives:
-Is able to give the viewer a feeling of epicness that some anime's fall short on.  The series gives an interesting examination on what could happen if all electronics were to fail instantly.  (what happens to the world after Kurt Russel pushed that button at the end of Escape from LA).
-It certainly did not follow the general stereotypical characters and set itself apart with unique personalities.
-I found the tentative revealing on how the world became as it was and the main character's past quite intriguing

Negatives:
-The first two disks are dreadfully slow and abstract, that I struggled to get through.  The series does however pick up quite a bit after the second disk (8th-10th episode)
-I never really felt a real connection with any of the characters, because of the abstract style of the anime.
-Some mysteries were drawn out far too long while any average viewer would have figured it out 2-3 episodes before it was revealed
-Although the graphics bring a nice feeling of classic anime's, the ""battles"" and animation are almost laughably atrocious for an anime series released in 2007.  I felt almost embarrassed to watch some of the interactions.
-The ending while not a complete failure, proved to be predictable and almost copy-catted from Evangelion and its like.

All in all, Gilgamesh was a unique new-age Anime...that is worth watching once then stashing it on your shelf of anime to collect dust.",1230508800,,1624,4.9411764705882355
