7878965,5,6304880952,"Me O' Riley wrote an excellent book. It was very well written and he obviously did his research well. There was not too much I had not already known from previous books, but, this author 's writing style is so good it makes other authors pale in comparison. As a medical person there were questions I would have liked to ask Mr O'Riley.,But, in all honesty he most likely could not answer them. One such question was: Jack was supposed to have an open wound down his spine about 10"". He wore a brace it is said, yet, this incision did not interrupt his sexual conquests daily in his pool? This does not add up medically. I am not doubting the author,perhaps what he was told was a tad exaggerated
 On a whole, I strongly recommend this book, for it's content and the pleasure of reading a really good writer",1429056000,,807,4.38
7878966,5,6304880952,"Using vintage archival film and TV footage, as well as newer interviews with some of the key participants, The Discovery Channel's ""JFK: The End Of Camelot"" provides a rich, textured look into the shocking and world-affecting events of November 22, 1963, the day that President John F. Kennedy was killed by a sniper in Dallas, Texas.
This 90-minute VHS video features many new interviews, including the last interview ever given by Texas Governor John Connally, who was in the same car as JFK when the shots rang out in Dealey Plaza that fateful Friday in Dallas, and was also wounded (and very nearly lost his own life in the attack).
I'd highly recommend this video program to anyone who might want to look back at those four awful days in late 1963.",1066348800,2,753,4.712121212121212
