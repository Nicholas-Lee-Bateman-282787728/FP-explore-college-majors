2651372,3,B000I2JDBM,"So-so beer and pretzel movie. B-grade movie, decent acting. Movie starts slowly, but the suspense builds and actually did hold my interest once the characters got in the woods to hunt deer. Once there, the hunters become the hunted. I enjoyed the ""surprise"" ending too, although it was somewhat predictable. Worth renting for a weekend evening if you don't have anything better to do.",1209859200,,384,5.015625
2651373,1,B000I2JDBM,"The blurb on the back of the DVD case compares this film to Blair Witch and Predator.  While it is true all 3 films had actors, were filmed with cameras and are available on DVD, this is about as far as the comparsion can go.  This film was boring, pure and simple.  I was actually rooting for the deer the whole time, I was hoping he would get some help from the other forest creatures and turn the tables on ""handsome man"", ""whiny brat"" and ""jerky drunk"".  I've seen better films on Youtube, don't waste your time on this fetid pile of garbage.",1189209600,3,546,4.271844660194175
2651374,4,B000I2JDBM,"The film was very well done for an independent film.  The plot was fun, there was mystery, suspense and definately a top thriller.

The only issue I had was the ending was a little too mainstream for an independent film.  Definately worth the money.",1178582400,4,249,4.613636363636363

2651376,3,B000I2JDBM,"I always remember that ""Star Trek"" was sold as ""'Wagon Train' to the stars"" and that ""Miami Vice"" was simply ""MTV cops"" to the network.  ""Hollywood,"" by which I mean the entire entertainment industry, always likes to pass off something old as something new.  They are never interested in breaking new ground, just in making more money, and God forbid that they do not have ample cinematic references to make them feel that they on the right track.  On our end of the entertainment universe we only get to watch these things, but it is fun to work on the cinematic math on a movie.  For example, ""The 13th Warrior"" equals ""The Seven Samurai"" plus ""Beowulf"" with ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" thrown in for fun.  I bring this all up because it does not take you long to figure out that ""The Hunt"" equals ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>"" meets ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Most-Dangerous-Game/dp/0780022114/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Most Dangerous Game</a>"" via ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files</a>"" (if you are old enough to remember ""The Most Dangerous Game"" substitute ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Zone/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Zone</a>"" for the ""X-Files,"" but if you have never heard of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" think of something more recent like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eliminator/dp/B00026L8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eliminator</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>"" instead, although the flip in the story reminds me of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Audition/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Audition</a>"" these days).

The tagline for this 2006 film is: ""A great number of hunters - a great number of deer. Statistically something was bound to go wrong.""  This is certainly an interesting tagline, but not especially on point for describing ""The Hunt"" (it makes the movie sound like that video game where the deer hunt the hunters).  Jack Hamberg (Joe Michael Burke) wants to make a commercial video about deer hunting using a bow and arrow and he has hired news cameraman Atticus Monroe (Robert Rusler) to film it.  He gets funding from Jon Kraw (Cliff De Young), whose ex-wife Tessa (Amy Briede) is now married to Hamberg.  Just to add to the mix, Hamberg is taking his stepson, Clint (Mitchell Burns) along to make the video.  While out on their hunt the trio crosses over into a private preserve, at which point the hunters become the hunted.  It takes a while for them to catch on, but there are just too many familiar warning signs for us to avoid and so we know full well what to expect.

That is obviously ""The Most Dangerous Game"" part of the proceedings, and the fact that Monroe is filming most of what happens is the ""Blair Witch Project"" part of the equation.  ""The X-Files"" part comes at the end, and between the caption on the cover of the 0VD (""They went on a hunt.  They became the hunted"") and the eerie picture of the ""beast"" depicted, I really think they are giving away too much of the game here.  But my main complaint is not that the people who put the DVD package together are spoiling their own film, but that in addition to all of the above the movie adds a second major thread that takes place after the Hunt.  With the three people missing, Jon Kraw is doing everything he can to find his missing son and the others.  So as we follow the events of the hunt we know that the search for them is going to last more than a week.  To continue the ""Blair Witch Project"" element, Kraw videotapes what is happening with the search and his investigation.  But unlike ""BWP,"" not everything shot in ""The Hunt"" is ""filmed"" by the characters, which makes it a sort of half-hearted conceit.  Much is made that this film was directed by Fritz Kiersch, who has some cult status because he directed ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-the-Corn/dp/6305972591/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of the Corn</a>"" (I think the fact it was a Stephen King short story might have something to do with what people think of that particular film).  But by telling the story through the two time frames and mixing the first-person and third-person camera bit, things get needlessly complicated.  The same happens with all of the interpersonal tension that develops between the trio being hunted.  The point was to add the elements together to make this movie and not multiply by them insteadm which is why I rounded down on ""The Hunt.""",1177977600,6,4962,5.803030303030303

8143313,2,B000I2JDBM,"""The Hunt"" starts out pretty good.  It is about  a man who is taping a segment for a documentary on hunting who takes his step son with him on the journey so they can bond.  They (camera man, kid, and step father) enter into a part of the woods that were forbidden for hunting.  It begins smoothly then degenerates into another really poor movie.  A choppy stupid premise used many times over and completely boring.  Some of the actors were pretty good, some lame, and others really poor.  I wish people would make a good movie, with a good ending even if it was a budget movie.  The Aliens were not that great looking and were not scary.

8143314,2,B000I2JDBM,"If you choose to watch The Hunt (and I'm not saying you shouldn't,) you may want to invest in some hair plugs.  You're going to spend the bulk of the film scratching your head.  What exactly was the creepy research-site-salt-pile-place?  What was the significance of the creepy voice in the woods or the deer with the branch protruding through its neck?  As near as I could tell, none of these elements had any bearing on the film itself, and were merely inserted just to lampshade the main characters' mind-blowingly awful decisions.

Think the kids from Blair Witch were a little dumb?  They were astrophysicists compared to our intrepid trio.  These geniuses meet all manner of colorfully creepy Deliverance folk on their way to the forest, cross under a prison fence whilst stalking a deer, go right past a buckshot ""no trespassing"" sign, bear witness to all the weirdness mentioned above, and still decide that hunkering down in an abandoned branch-and-leaf shelter is preferable to returning to the truck and civilization. Why?  Because they're filming a hunting video which will apparently make their fortunes once Walmart (Walmart!) picks it up, and this is apparently the one remaining tract of in the Western Hemisphere where the Great White Hunter might find the ever-elusive White Tailed Deer.  Or maybe it's because there might be escaped prisoners, and exclusive footage might somehow redeem the douchebag cameraman's career.  Or maybe it was because the wimpy kid was hungry, and required eight hours to consume a Snickers bar.

Which was it?  I'm not sure, and I'm not sure the director was either.  He may have been too busy trying to decide just what it was he was trying to make. The Hunt obviously wanted to do the ""Lost Tapes"" thing, but couldn't quite commit, and ended up with about 2/3 professional cinematography and ominous music thrown in for the spooky bits.  This uncertainty carried pervaded the film at an almost molecular level.  He wanted to have one character go homicidal, but couldn't seem to conjure up a motivation for him to do so (wanting to film a hunting documentary in the middle of the night does not seem like a logical reason to go about waving revolvers at people.) He wanted the father leading the search party to have found and watched the lost tapes, but not know any more than the viewers did at that exact moment (as such, he ended up asking a lot of stupid questions that were answered five minutes later in the footage he supposedly watched.)  He even wanted (spoiler alert) for the government/hillbillies/alien deer to have found and destroyed the lost footage, but for us to still somehow be able to watch it.

This is not to say that the film was bad.  Even though the concept (a twist on the hunter-becomes-the-hunted trope) was poorly delivered, it was somewhat clever, the actors made the best of some horrible material, the CG wasn't the worst I've seen, and a few moments that could have been spooky if the delivery hadn't been so ham-fisted.  I've certainly seen worse, and if you're a die hard ""Lost Tapes"" fan, or in the mood for a nonsensical B-Movie, this might do.",1360368000,,3132,4.809701492537314
8143315,2,B000I2JDBM,"The Hunt (Fritz Kiersch, 2006)

I've been trying to write a review of The Hunt for, according to my spreadsheet, almost exactly a month now. (I watched it on November 11 and I'm writing this on December 9.) I've started it three or four times, and then it sizzles out about halfway through. I like the parallel that makes to the movie, actually, which starts off in a kind of slow-but-awesome mode and then degenerates into a weird mishmash of survival horror and sci-fi before jumping right off a cliff in the final minutes.

Made in mockumentary format (in the same ""here's this video we found"" mode as The Blair Witch Project et al.), The Hunt is the parallel stories of a trio of guys who go into a private land-lease they've rented in order to make a hunting video and the frantic efforts of one guy's ex-wife and her new husband to find out what happened to them. The hunters are played by Joe Michael Burke (Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles), Mitchell Burns (Pearl), and Robert Rusler (The Whole Ten Yards), while the frantic ex-wife (of Burke's character) and her husband are Amy Briede (Surveillance) and the ubiquitous Cliff DeYoung (Last Flight Out).

It's the trying-to-find-the-guys scenes that make this movie worth watching. DeYoung is by far the most experienced of the actors in this flick, and that's obvious. That part of the script is better-written, as well; we get a real sense of creeping dread as Briede and DeYoung's characters encounter roadblock after roadblock in their investigation, and then try and figure out why everyone who lives in the area is so close-mouthed about the history of disappearances in the area. The hunting plotline starts off interestingly enough, setting up some real tension between Burke's and Rusler's characters, but all that gets abandoned once the whole sci-fi-survival-horror thing kicks in unless it's convenient to the plot.

The other reason to watch it is the controversy which didn't surround the film when it came out (a la Blair Witch, but has sprung up in the years since its release. While this is another ""OMGTRUE!"" flick that has the ""all events are fictitious etc."" disclaimer at the end, some media-critic Internet pundits have done a little research, and found out that this movie is indeed based on a number of true stories; if they are accurately reporting the accounts (note I'm not saying ""if the accounts are accurate""), then this is far closer to a ""based on a true story"" flick than is, say, The Strangers (which was billed as based on a true story). As such, if you're a fan of this sort of thing, it's worth your time. That said, I can't tell you what ""this sort of thing"" is, because that would be a major spoiler. But still. If you like things that are a little (okay, a lot) outside the purview of accepted reality, you'll probably want to give this one a look. If you're just looking for a good movie, put this one closer to the bottom of your list. **",1260489600,6,2937,4.686046511627907
8143316,1,B000I2JDBM,"I have to admit that I'm a fan of some thriller/horror/slasher/sci-fi flicks, but I didn't get this one.  I happen to like Predator, and I thought Blair Witch was good by playing on a different set of fears than the usual movies in this genre.  This movie basically came across to me as a one hour and ten minute family drama tacked on to an instructional bow-hunting buildup to 7 minutes of transparent effects.  We kept checking the remaining time, trying to figure out how they were going to squeeze any action into it.

They didn't.

And, just because the fence is bent up, don't go under it.",1217808000,2,596,4.481481481481482
