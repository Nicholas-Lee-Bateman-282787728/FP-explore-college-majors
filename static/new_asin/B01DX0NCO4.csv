7725757,4,B01DX0NCO4,"This was one of those little gems that almost vanished forever. The last time I saw this was 1973 in a double feature with SSSSSSS. When they released that movie I was hoping for this one also. Finally, it's here. If you expecting American Werewolf in London, don't. But it is a genuine thriller in the vain of the original Wolfman movies, the acting is I think really good and it is a fun movie to watch.",1472860800,4,405,4.2727272727272725
7725758,3,B01DX0NCO4,"Direct from 1973 and let me say that I will actually go 2.5 for this thing. I will admit to enjoying small parts of it. I will admit to hating small parts of it. I will admit to really disliking the kid in this, really disliking him. Scott Sealey played the kid. I hope he never did anything else. His mother is played by Elanie DeVry a staple in the 70's for many of the old tv shows. The only decent actor is Kerwin Mathews (7th voyage of Sinbad) Dad and son go out on a outing to the woods son is attacked by a werewolf but dad intervenes and gets bitten and you can guess the rest. The kid tries to tell everyone and no one believes him. I am not a fan even though I love werewolf movies. I swear the kid and his diddainful mom killed this for me.",1472688000,,751,3.9473684210526314

7725762,3,B01DX0NCO4,"Well... Leonard Maltin gave it TWO STARS saying that ""not much good at anything... odd werewolf makeup"".
I have to admit the monster WAS a bit odd looking, but you'll have to remember that this is NOT a horror movie.
It's a ( PG-rated ) story about a kid that finds out that---image it!---his father is actually a wolf man. Yeah! I have
to admit this is more of a family MOVIE than a family MASSACRE.
If YOU enjoy werewolf movies, yourself, and you have a young son, you MAY want to introduce him to the saga
of The Wolf Man in cinema. I suggest that you, BOTH, watch these movies in THIS order:
Wolf Man-- 1941
Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein [Dracula/Invisible Man/Wolf Man]-- 1948
Teen Wolf
The Boy Who Cried Werewolf
Silver Bullet
American Werewolf In London/ Howling/ Dog Soldiers/ Wolf/ Ginger Snaps, among
more-recent horror flicks will make THIS movie look like a '70s soap opera episode.",1467244800,4,902,4.64375

8757142,2,B01DX0NCO4,"The Boy Who Cried Werewolf, 1973 film

A man and his son go to the woods and stay in a cabin. A creature watches them, then attacks Richie. His father Robert attacks the creature and kills it. [Dark scenes obscure the events.] The creature falls off a cliff. The Sheriff questions the father. The attackers fingerprints aren't on file, his blood type is strange. Richies Mom greets them and learns what happened. Richie is seeing a psychiatrist because of his belief in a werewolf! The psychiatrist advises them to return to the woods; there will be an extra charge. They see cars and people in a gathering. The Sheriff snoops into the cars, then orders them to leave because they don't have a permit.

But something happens to Robert at night, he changes into a werewolf! Richie runs away. Help! An automobile and a van have accidents when they meet the werewolf. Richie finds shelter in a trailer, the man will take him home. But his father isn't there so they return. The next morning Robert finds his son. The police investigate the accidents. What could have done it? Will the creature return to the cabin? Or to that trailer and push it over a cliff? The Sheriff and others are searching for the creature. Richie is now afraid of staying with his father.

They visits the psychiatrist again. Whats wrong with Richie? There is a full moon again, Richie is afraid to go to the cabin in the woods with his father. That psychiatrist is murdered! Richies Mom will stay with them. They stop by that commune who praise the lord and dance in a circle. Robert cant enter the pentagram! Can the parents get together again? Richie is asked to lock his Dad in the shed and not tell his Mom. She learns the truth!

Can they get away? That commune is awakened. What can they do? Sunrise affects the werewolf, the face changes back to human form. Richie tells the Sheriff his father is a werewolf. Is Roberts index finger lengthening? The citizens are told to go back home. [Does Big Brother know best?] Back at that cabin Robert has changed again. The screams bring the Sheriffs men, they shoot at the creature. The commune will pack up and move away. The Sheriff and his men search for the creature and find him with Richie. They shoot the creature, who runs away until he falls down. It returns to its human form. But it bit Richie on his forearm. [Whats next?]

It takes a good script to make a good movie, and this is less than good. There used to be a market for Drive-In movies, low value productions that returned a profit because the customers expectations were not demanding, and this is one of them.",1497916800,,2601,4.537313432835821

8757148,3,B01DX0NCO4,"BOTTOM LINE: A so-so ""horror"" film from the 1970's. Heavy on the talk, light on the monster action. Worth a look if you're a wolfman fan or just curious about this little-seen, not very well known monster flick. A passable time-killer I suppose, but certainly nothing worth fretting over if you never get a chance to see it. Casual viewers are advised to rent, stream or only buy used. I give it 3 STARS, but as with all things, IMHO/YMMV.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Kerwin Matthews, (swashbuckling star of the classic 7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD), here stars as a recently divorced dad trying to maintain a positive relationship with his young son, while at the same time hoping to re-kindle the sparks with his estranged wife. To that end, father & son spend manly bonding time up at the family mountain retreat. Then one evening while hiking, junior is attacked by a furry something-or-other. His father races to the rescue, however things go from bad to worse when Pop kills the thing but gets bitten in the process. Familiar werewolf curse ensues and poor Junior soon discovers, much to his frustration, that he's unable to convince anyone that dear old Dad has now become an honest-to-goodness night-prowling, moon-howling wolf man.

THOUGHTS: Dysfunctional family dynamic melodrama, masquerading as a lycanthropian monster film. The werewolf design is interesting and more than a little reminiscent of the make-up used in the Sam Katzman-produced 1956 film THE WEREWOLF. However there are lots of whiny, kid-centric scenes & a Jesus-freak/hippy subplot (which was topical when made), that may be a turn off for modern monster fans. Acting quality ranges from okay to awful. Kerwin looks like he's trying, but the weak script doesn't give him much to work with. The cinematographer's Ed Wood-ian inability to maintain picture consistency combined with the questionable decision to utilize excessive (and poorly staged) day-for-night shooting made many of the ""tense"" dark of the moon / werewolf scenes rather laughable. While it was cool to finally see a film which I had previously only been able to read about over the years, it really wasn't much when it was all said & done.

THE BLU-RAY: Shout! Factory's hi-def release of THE BOY WHO CRIED WEREWOLF is a decent if unspectacular effort. Picture is good; sharp focus & solid colors with only minimal dirt, debris and scratches. Nothing much in the way of artifacting or pixelation and no edge enhancement that I could detect. Audio portion is clean, clear & strong and the soundmix is level. Only bonus content is a brief photo gallery and the film's theatrical trailer.",1476835200,3,2628,4.995433789954338
8757149,5,B01DX0NCO4,So thrilled this has finally come out on Blu-ray (let alone home video)! Great flick.,1476576000,,85,4.733333333333333
