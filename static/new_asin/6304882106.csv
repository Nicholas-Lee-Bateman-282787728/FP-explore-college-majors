7878634,5,6304882106,"Shameful this is not available on DVD/Bluray.
This is the best documentary I've seen on the Watergate scandal.
It contains 3 videos of 90 minutes each and interviews all the living participants including John Dean who doesn't show up on these things very often.  Well done now try and release it on dvd.",1408320000,,303,4.716981132075472
7878635,5,6304882106,"Like most of the other reviewers, I found this to be an outstanding documentary.  The set is divided into 5 parts: Break-In, Cover-Up, Scapegoat, Massacre, and Impeachment.  I found the entire set compelling.  You actually get to see the German Shepherds (Haldeman & Erlichman), along with the likes of Charles Colson, Jeb Stuart MaGruder, and Fred LaRue admit to what was going on in the White House.  Haldeman was particularly forthright just months before he died.

I would also recommend the companion book to this set by Fred Emery.  The book goes into even more depth than the video, which is again very interesting during the interview segments with some of Nixon's men.  A lot has been written about Watergate, and some of it begs the question of authenticity.  It is hard to argue, however; when Haldeman's beloved wife tells Emery that her husband deserved to go to jail.",1114041600,4,881,4.865771812080537

7878638,5,6304882106,"I have the tapes but am itching for a DVD release.  This production, without question, is one of the finest pieces of documentary filmmaking.  Not a dull rehash of familiar events but a film that is as relevant and compelling as anything that the best Hollywood yabos could ever cook up.  Get the DVD out!!!!",1060732800,7,308,4.5636363636363635
7878639,5,6304882106,"Although almost 5 hours, the docu is fast-paced, informative and most importantly: puts all the loose story threads into an easy-to-follow and chronological context.
The producers were able to interview everyone  involved, and I mean EVERYONE (except Nixon, who said the David Frost  interviews spoke for themselves, he was alive at the time of filming. John  Mitchell who had died in 1988 and Kissinger, who most experts agree had  little to do with Watergate.)
Most impressive are the interview snippets  with H.R. Haldeman, dying of cancer at the time and clearly one of the last  things he ever did. His notes are a godsend to history junkies. He died  shortly after completing this series.
However, as tragic as the story  was, it's amazing how not one of the guys interviewed (except Fred LaRue)  shows the slightest remorse for what happened.
The research, narration,  and score are perfect... some of the interviews are hilarious: Private Eye  Tony Ulasewicz, Gordon Liddy (in a sick way) and even John Dean who  recounts some pretty funny moments during the planning stages of how to  sabatoge the Democrats.
Not just the best documentary ever about  Watergate, it may be one of the best documentaries ever...period.",953856000,9,1225,5.06
7878640,5,6304882106,"An excellent video collectors edition of the complete Watergate Scandal.  This series covers the entire Watergate Affair from start to finish and all the key players involved.  It contains interviews from the Watergate  burglars, prosecuters, FBI agents, Nixon himself, and all the Presdient's  men.  Also, contains coverage of the infamous Nixon tapes that brought him  down.  Highly recommended.  Very concise, complete, and comprehensive!",949190400,4,441,5.888888888888889
