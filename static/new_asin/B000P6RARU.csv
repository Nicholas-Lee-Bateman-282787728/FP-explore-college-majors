8189670,5,B000P6RARU,"This is an amazing dvd, but what else could you expect from Bill Mason`s daughter. Any paddler should have this and all Becky`s dvds.",1360972800,,133,4.583333333333333
8189671,5,B000P6RARU,This was a gift for my dad and he said it's very interesting and useful. The transaction went smoothly and received the item very fast. Very happy with this buy.,1355702400,,161,4.4
8189672,4,B000P6RARU,"I had the same teacher that Becky did -- her father, the great Bill Mason, whom I had the priviledge of meeting at the ""Canoecopia"" show years ago -- but I learned from him from his books and a VHS tape.  My other teacher was one of the fellows who owned and operated Blackhawk Canoes in Janesville, Wisconsin; he made the best solo-canoeing instructional video I've ever seen!  (No longer available, of course, as far as I know.)  This one, by Ms. Mason, is also superb -- I cannot understand the criticism that it does not offer good instructions, as I think it certainly does -- but I was disappointed that in it she does not teach what her father called ""the Indian stroke,"" which is basically just the ""Canadian stroke"" (which she does show) except that the blade is swept all the way forward underwater and is NOT removed from the water; instead, at the conclusion [toward the bow] you rotate the upper grip in your hand and then begin the power stroke again.  With this stroke, and especially with the shaft resting on the gunnel (which can be used as a fulcrum!), not only can you paddle all day on one side, but you can do so almost effortlessly!  Why the omission?  I don't know, but I did note (on my recent trip up to Madison, where I as always stopped in at Rutabaga) that she has a second DVD out on solo canoeing, so maybe she was saving this for that!  By the way, what she refers to as the ""C stroke"" I learned from the Blackhawk video as the ""travelling C,"" and that fellow used that stroke to move next to the ""Canadian stroke"" and thence to the ""Indian stroke.""  Try it that way; that progression makes the learning easier, in my opinion.",1342051200,3,1658,4.37785016286645
8189673,1,B000P6RARU,"This was less about technique than it was about pretty scenes and not-so-deep thoughts. This is a DVD that I won't watch again. If you're looking for a good solo canoeing technique DVD, get Bill Mason's Path of the Paddle Solo Basics. It is everything this DVD is not.",1300579200,,268,4.489795918367347
8189674,5,B000P6RARU,"For illustrating the joy and beauty in solo canoeing this book is tops. For those who want tips on efficient solo canoeing, the instructions are more clearly shown than if you were out on the water because the camera focuses in on the details of the stroke. If you were on the water, you would have the distractions of trying to position the canoes so you can see what is being shown. Makes me want to get back in my canoe right now.",1239667200,,433,4.228915662650603
8189675,5,B000P6RARU,"A clear, beautiful and informative display of canoe paddling techniques. I watched this all winter long when I couldn't get out on the water. Now, if only I could paddle as well as she. Of course my father was not Bill Mason! Some people have all the luck!",1237507200,,256,4.354166666666667
