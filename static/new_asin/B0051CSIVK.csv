8452561,1,B0051CSIVK,I was very disappointed with this dvd.  I purchased Kries' Pilates  dvd many years ago and still use it.  This is more a teaching dvd than an exercise one.  You have to listen to a lot of instructions - which may be ok for some people but I want to exercise - not listen to a lecture.,1488844800,,284,3.9298245614035086
8452562,3,B0051CSIVK,"What are the ""Toys""?

They are the following: the physio ball (large Swiss ball), a pair of light dumbbells, and the Magic Circle.

The workouts are quick and easy introductions to Pilates ""Toys"". I liked the Magic Circle workout the best because it was long enough to work around the whole body; the other two felt too short. I wish that these workouts were a little longer.

Each exercise is usually done for about 8 reps. These are mostly beginning workouts, with many of the exercises being fairly easy.

Here are the breakdowns of the three Pilates - Toys workouts.
