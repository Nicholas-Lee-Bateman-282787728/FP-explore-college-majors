7726252,5,B01DYN0MJ8,"One the best 1950's Bogart films, Richard Brooks' ""Deadline - U.S.A."" is a fast moving, honest drama with noir elements.  The entire cast is perfect.  I've been waiting for someone to release this film on DVD and Blu-ray and Kino/Lorber did a bang-up job, complete with Eddie Muller's great and insightful commentary.",1471910400,,317,5.076923076923077

7726254,4,B01DYN0MJ8,"The movie is one of my favorite Humphrey Bogart vehicles.  However, I was very disappointed as Amazon advertised the DVD being subtitled and unfortunately this was not the case.  Fortunately, though I was able to understand about 90 % of the dialogue.  Amazon should remove the subtitled aspect from their description.",1470268800,7,318,5.196078431372549
7726255,5,B01DYN0MJ8,"Deadline USA is a solid five star film staring one of my favorites, Humphrey Bogart. It's one of the more realistic newspaper movies I've seen. There are few laughs, some charming characters and a plot and subplot to keep a viewer interested and entertained. This was recently released in DVD. I've been waiting for it to be available for years. It was worth the wait.",1469923200,,368,4.676923076923077
7726256,1,B01DYN0MJ8,"So now Kino is king of the no-subtitles blu-ray genre after Olive Films finally got wise and started including English subtitles in their blu-ray releases. Kino seems oblivious to the fact that the lack of English subtitles is not just a minor drawback for millions of potential customers. Its a deal-breaker. DEADLINE USA is not a must-have item and I was on the fence about purchasing it, but Kinos decision to omit subtitles pushed me into the thanks, but no thanks camp. This is a repeat performance of what Kino did a few weeks ago with OX-BOW INCIDENT, although there they were dealing with a famous classic which millions of film fans will be precluded from enjoying because of Kinos refusal to include English subtitles. Ive called and written polite letters and emails to Kino about this and received only silence in return. Fair enough, no response from them, no money from me and probably ditto from millions of others. There are lots of movie lovers with less than perfect hearing or who are non-native English speakers who will simply have to wait for these titles to be reissued by a more savvy film studio.",1469750400,18,1121,4.753846153846154
7726257,4,B01DYN0MJ8,"Late in his career, Humphrey Bogart played a number of offbeat roles, and one of the more unusual, and entertaining, was as a (typically for Bogart) hardnosed newspaper editor in ""Deadline USA."" Surprisingly, many movie fans, even those who love Bogie, are unfamiliar with this movie, because it's been virtually impossible to find on television or video in recent years. Now, however, Kino Lorber rectifies that oversight with a DVD and Blu-ray release.

In Deadline USA, Bogart plays Ed Hutcheson, managing editor of the ""Day,"" a fictional newspaper, presumably in New York, that's on its last legs. The widow (Ethel Barrymore) and daughters of the former publisher are going to probate court to get approval to sell the paper to a rival who wants to close it down to pick up the Day's circulation base. If the sale goes through, they only have three days left, but in that time, Hutcheson is after one more big story. He intends to bring down mobster Frank Rienzi (Martin Gabel), whom the authorities have been unable to touch, and he hopes to do so by tying Rienzi to the sensational recent unsolved murder of a young woman. Hutcheson has a personal stake in the matter, since he allowed a young reporter, George Burrows (Warren Stevens), to pursue the story, only to have Burrows badly beaten by Rienzis goons.

Deadline USA was written and directed by Richard Brooks, who was a former newspaperman himself, and the story is loosely based on the closing of Joseph Pulitzers former paper, the New York World after Pulitzers family decided they wanted out of the business after his death. What is truly surprising about the movie is how well many of its themes resonate today. Of course, corporate takeovers and mass layoffs are commonplace today, but 1950s audiences didn't want to think about such subjects.

Those audiences also didn't spend much time thinking about the nature of the news they were getting. Early in the film, Hutcheson and his reporters bemoan the demise of real journalism in favor of newspapers that offer more entertainment in the form of horoscopes and racing tips than actual news. Just imagine what Hutcheson would think about todays social media version of the news. Later, two of the reporters actually come to blows over whether they should risk their lives for a paper that won't be around another week. In the last 15 minutes of the movie, Bogart gets to give two stirring (if a bit overboard) speeches about the power and need for a free press. In that regard, Deadline USA serves as a solid counterpoint to Billy Wilders contemporary (and far better known today) Ace in the Hole.

Bogart fans will find a lot to enjoy in Deadline USA. Ed Hutcheson is a vintage Bogart tough guy, a man who slaps around a sniveling informant to make sure the man reveals what he knows and who also starts investigating his ex-wifes (Kim Hunter) new fianc, in the hopes of turning up some dirt. But when Hutcheson appears in front of the probate court to plead his case to keep the paper going, its a powerful glimpse of Bogart at his best.

Deadline USA doesnt rank among the best of Bogart movies (some very rare atmosphere here), but its a solid second-tier effort. Bogart gets terrific support from some familiar period faces like Ed Begley, Paul Stewart, and even Jim Backus as some of his reporters, and the movie is full of typical Richard Brooks crackling sharp dialogue (at one point, Bogart mentions that the heirs lawyers are trying to explain the nature of the crime with facts, figures, and falsehoods. One more F and they won't get drafted.) The plot is jammed full of convenient coincidences that allow the reporters to get their story improbably quickly, but viewers won't mind if it helps Bogart go out on top. Fans of Bogart, period films, or journalism movies in general should stop the presses for Deadline USA.",1468627200,4,3850,4.792168674698795
7726258,4,B01DYN0MJ8,"Very good Humphrey Bogart movie. Part of the film's ending is too predictable, and I didn't really care for the parts between Bogart and Kim Hunter (On the other hand too little is seen of Ethel Barrymore) but otherwise the film is fine. It is short and many good performances are given by the supporting cast.",1467849600,,310,4.553571428571429
7726259,5,B01DYN0MJ8,"""Deadline USA"" (1952) is one of the rare Humphrey Bogart films that has never received an official DVD release in North America.
Caught in a legal limbo.
It's finally appearing on this very nice Blu-Ray (or DVD) from Kino/Lorber.
and they even included an audio commentary with film noir expert Eddie Muller,
plus the movie trailer and trailers for two non-Bogart films noir.
Dark and moody, ""Deadline USA"" is not really a film noir, but it was photographed to look very noir-ish under director Richard Brooks' guidance.

Humphrey Bogart made 53 films as a contract player for Warner Brothers between 1932 (""Three on a Match"") and 1948 (""Key Largo"").
In 1949 he left Warner to become an independent actor and sometime producer (Santana Productions),
starring in seventeen films between 1949 and 1956.
The Independent Bogart had two huge Technicolor successes:
""The African Queen"" (1951 - Bogart's only Oscar, and
""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954)

In his early career, Humphrey Bogart was typecast as a gangster.
Later on, he was typecast as the Good Guy fighting organized crime (or Nazis).
In Bogart's post-Warner career, he often resisted these stereotypes, playing some very complicated characters -
""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950)  are two of the best examples.

But 1952's ""Deadline USA"" is a throwback - An old-fashioned example of the Good Guy fighting organized crime.
Bogart's not a G-Man, but a Crusading Newspaper Editor.
- Admittedly another Hollywood cliche,
but even though ""Deadline USA"" is a pretty old-fashioned Bogart Movie, it's a very entertaining film.
It helps if you like old-fashioned Bogart Movies.
I do.
Darryl Zanuck, head of Twentieth Century Fox, was reluctant to cast Bogart in the lead (he thought Bogart was over-the-hill) but yielded to director Richard Brooks.
Zanuck was happily proved wrong when, shortly before this film's release, Bogart won the Academy Award for ""The African Queen"".

Excellent picture - licensed from Twentieth Century Fox by Kino/Lorber.
My only complaint is no subtitles.
Black and white, of course.

7726288,5,B01DYN0MJ8,"One of Bogart's late movies and also one of his best. Great acting from all especially Kim hunter and Ethel Barrymore (for my money she's the best of the Barrymores, Ed Begley and really flocks of good turns by a raft of top character actors and actresses. (You know some of my actress friends say we all are actors now--for the life of me I can't see anything wrong with the word ""actress""--it's a beautiful sound--I mean can you imagine Kate or Bette objecting to being called a ""great actress"".  Hey Linda Hunt won Best Supporting Actress for playing a Vietnamese guy--please forgive the digression--or don't, whatever.)  Also I can really recommend the version with commentary. Started watching it right after I watched the movie (almost never do that)--but it hit on just the things I wanted to know and was great fun--a combination of film and bio info and good gossip--The commentator is a professional film fan--not the director or someone connected to the film--and that makes it less like film criticism (which is okay sometimes), and his enthusiasm is so genuine and he gives you ideas for other films to watch you might not have thought of on your own.) The whole package here is super.  The film really makes one nostalgic for the old days of investigative journalism, (even though a lot of us can't really remember them) real print newspapers, and reporters who actually had enough character in them for great actors & actresses like Bogart, Redford, Hoffman and Rosalind Russell and(________) Fill in your own favorite actor-who-played-crusading-journalist and let me know so I can get it.)  You might want to try ""Truth"" the recent film about Dan Rather that CBS tried and more or less succeeded, in repressing-- even though this is about television journalism, a virtual oxymoron. Gee I  can't wait until we get the Billy Bush bio-pic!

This is the story of a crusading newspaper that prides itself on honesty, and fighting corruption, but as it set in to battle a powerful criminal figure, it is found the heirs of the late owner plan to sell  the paper to a rival who will shut it down.  This weakens the paper, and threatens to stop it's ability to report on such a volatile story at such a critical time. Bogart as the papers editor has only a couple of days to try to block the sale of the paper, or try to bring the story to a conclusion nailing the crook, all while trying to hold the staff together until one of those things happens. Oh yea, Bogart's ex wife who he still loves, and wants to reconcile with announces she plans to get married. Bogie tries to undo that as well , while juggling the main story plots. It's one of those good guys versus bad guys black and white noir style movies I love with a strong supporting cast as well, with actors like Jim Backus and Ed Begley on hand for the newspaper, as well as Ethel Barrymore as the late owners widow who tries to block the sale of the paper by her greedy daughters who own the majority shares.",1520035200,,1198,4.2043478260869565

This is the best movie I have screened in a long, long time.  For those of us who wish for ""the good old days"" and the days when things right, correct, honest and just this is the film to be reckoned with.

You can just see and feel Ben Bradlee and Katherine Graham at work here.

If our movie industry and our newspaper/media industry were now only as good as this movie and this newspaper and its Publisher, Editor and People, we really would live in a GREAT Country.  Everything that we have lost in American is pretty much displayed in this film.  America has lost its honesty and the basic fight for good against evil.  Evil is now an icon to be fought for, won and achieved.  The good guys and nice guys do finish last.

If Hollywood were not the cesspool and septic that it is, America would still be making films such as this.  Good guys like ""Bogey"" would still be starring in them.
