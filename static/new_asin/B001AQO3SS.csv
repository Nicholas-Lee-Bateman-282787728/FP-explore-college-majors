3459295,5,B001AQO3SS,"I love this movie but, sorry, I don't have a Blue Ray - Any way this gets released in DVD soon with all the extras.  I would hate to buy a blue ray JUST for this movie!!  Been waiting a lonnnng time for all the pieces to be put back in.

Okay, Update:  I have the DVD version without add ins.  My grandson informs me a Blue Ray will play on his Playstation/XBOX thingy!!!  Don't get me wrong..... I love this movie!!  So much so, it inspired me to visit Egypt TWICE!!!!!  Needless to say I have ordered this version with the add ins.  Still hope they eventually find ALL the pieces.  Here's hoping.

3459297,5,B001AQO3SS,"This restored version - the 4-hour release that was immediately rejected by theatres as impossible to screen 2x per night, forcing more than an hour to be cut - is an absolute delight for the eyes. From the first minutes when Caesar appears, the viewer is utterly riveted by the splashy spectacle, the evocation of a vastly different time, and acting that can only be called first rate. The only thing that threw me off, as a Roman history nut, was the inaccuracies that could only be made by an ignoramus.

On the positive side, the drama is a complete success: Cleopatra, the last Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, uses her feminine attributes and fine mind to advance a dream of staying in power and perhaps even create a new empire based on Roman power. To do so, she seduces first Julius Caesar, who restores her to power in a civil war with her brother-husband, and bears him a son. Once Julius dies, she then seduces his lieutenant, Marc Antony, eventually losing to the wily Octavian, Caesar's adopted son. In the process, she genuinely falls in love (with Antony), perhaps for the first time in her life. They die together by their own hand. Surely, this is one of the greatest dramas of power and love in the history of mankind and it is the basis of this film, executed to perfection.

The costumes, sets, and images of sex and power are wonderfully vivid, which the bluray version (I have the British one that is available for $10 in Europe) brings with the sharpest of clarity. Beyond the actors (whose salaries were the highest ever paid), these props are the reason for the cost of the film. In my opinion, they were worth every penny as there are few film experiences that could compete.

Finally, there is the acting. Taylor, just after her 1950s prime, is at her best as a politically savvy seductress, aging and scrambling to maintain her nation and heir in their positions of prominence. I found her convincing, astonishingly beautiful, and realistically shrewd. In my view, Rex Harrison believably projects the universal genius of Julius Caesar, whose calm in the face of overwhelming odds and ever-changing political calculus are implacable and unpredictable. McDowall is also a good Octavian, whom he plays as a sleazy, effeminate conniver, ultimately perhaps the smartest of all in a political sense. The only principal I feel does not give a subtle and interesting performance is Burton, whose Antony, while flawed as a love-starved drunk, is blandly formulaic. The supporting characters, such as Agrippa, are not all that distinguished, with the exception of the courtier Hugh Cronin.

On the negative side, the script really needed a scholar as consultant. Given that Mankiewicz was re-writing the script while directing, this was perhaps impossible. It is a pity, because while most of the blooper inaccuracies do not detract seriously from the storyline, they were constant irritants kind of like a buzzing mosquito at night. For example, Agrippa appears as a middle-aged lieutenant of Julius Caesar, when the person with whom he rose to prominence was Octavian, his coeval in age and talent. But there are bigger problems as well. Just prior to his assassination, Julius is shown as demanding that he be named King by the Senate, which he was far too subtle ever to do in life. This fundamentally distorts his character, making him more of a simple tyrant than a master manipulator whose end game, if he had one, will never be known due to his premature death. Finally, there are many political complexities that are left uncovered, such as Antony's massive and unprecedented failure to conquer Parthia, which broke him.  Antony also had many implacable enemies, such as Cicero, whose right hand he had nailed to the Senate doorway during the civil war that followed Caesar's assassination. I know I sound like a pedant, but given the lavishness of the production, why not have made it more accurate?

With all of its flaws, I still recommend this warmly. The extras are also excellent, such as the documentary of the chaos of its production.",1361923200,41,4064,4.874095513748191
3459298,4,B001AQO3SS,"I've always loved this movie, not only for the splendid sets, even though, 50 years later, they're more likely to look like the lobby for some Hyatt Regency hotel, but also for its literate script and star chemistry.  It's very clear these actors are all pros, in the grand old style of movie acting.  Like the historical figures they play, they are all bigger than life. And let's never forget the superb contribution of the music of Alex North, who wrote surely one of the greatest music scores for this epic, yet never forgetting the psychological undercurrents coiling around the drama's edges.

However, all that said, what are the extras on this fancy Blu-Ray release?  Are there any?  The previous DVD release had many, including the footage shot in England by previous director Rouben Mamoulian. It is known that more than 6 1/2 hrs. of footage were in a rough cut of this film, back when it was conceived as being released as 2 separate films. But only a few scenes of this were included on the previous DVD. Has any more of this footage been discovered?

I'll probably buy this, if only for the picture quality. But I'm getting a little fed up of being enticed to buy yet more editions of the same film, with no real incentives being offered.

And, not so unpredictably, there is no mention of any on this announcement, beyond the fact that it's supposed to be 2 disks.,,,",1361836800,18,1382,4.616326530612245
3459299,5,B001AQO3SS,"Cleo's have come and gone.  There have been many films and books depicting Cleo as she really was to great melodramatic Cleo.  Three other popular Cleo's were the Claudette Colbert (1934), Vivien Leigh (1945), and Leonor Varela (1999).  There were many more variations between those years.

The one Cleo that will always stand out and let's not forget Mark is the one staring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (1963).  I was old enough to enjoy it on the big screen.  Rex Harrison made a good Caesar; watch him have a similar attitude in ""The Honey Pot"" (1967).

Enough time, thought, and money have been put into this production that I am bound to overlook a few of the most important items about this film. The movie is more than just the actors are.  The characters are very well portrayed.  The set and costumes are dazzling.  They really showed up in the scene when Cleopatra entered Rome.  And the navel battle was spectacular.

The year 48 BCE, the place Egypt. The end of the great Pharos is near. The world is being usurped by Rome. We are looking at the story of a power struggle between brother and sister for the control of Egypt, and just as intriguing between two great empires and as results an unforgettable lone story. Will a great sew battle turn the tide?

Every one is going to have a favorite Cleo and find flaws in the others.  However this Cleo will always the one others are gauged by.

3459300,5,B001AQO3SS,"Cleopatra may be the most opulent motion picture of all time and is a testament to Elizabeth Taylor and the other actors and artisans from this pre-computer generated image era.  It was a high point for the magnificence of Todd-AO 70mm and the unique richness of De Luxe Color - all beautifully and faithfully transferred by 20th Century Fox to this new Blu-ray edition. I saw Cleopatra in its first run and recognized it's short-comings possibly caused by the severe cuts made to Joseph Mankiewicz's original vision to release Cleopatra, it is said, as two films telling the Caesar story in one film and the Anthony story in the second.  One can only imagine how much of the story and character development got left on the cutting room floor.  Cleopatra's legacy has moved far beyond earning the label as the most expensive film ever made - due to waste and mismanagement that nearly caused the demise of Fox Studios.  There are ""extras"" on the Blu-ray version that expose many of such myths. I invite you to see this Cleopatra - a beautiful example of what Blu-ray can do for home viewing and the potential for visually jaw-dropping moments that show the art of motion pictures.  This Cleopatra is perhaps more relevant than ever today with efforts to depict (at least Hollywood-style) a well-rounded view of one of the most famous female characters in history, as portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor, an icon of her times. I purchased my Blu-ray copy of Cleopatra in February, 2012 from amazon.co.uk after finding out it would play on U.S. players.  This spectacular Blu-ray version of Cleopatra will soon be available to purchase in the U.S.  Highly recommended to all film buffs.",1330214400,103,1678,4.846153846153846

3459328,4,B001AQO3SS,"Methinks this classic strains a bit so many years on. As a sword and sandal epic it is grand and lavish but the acting, by both Taylor and Burton, is often melodramatic/ overwrought. What I found most interesting in the movies portrayal was how Cleopatra was a very masculine figure in the sense of how she approached decisions, and how the men still tried to squelch this aspect of her personality/ fortitude, and just wanted to see her as their feminine conduit. I wonder how our current climate, with so many who want to wash away the terminology and ideology of masculinity and femininity, would approach or view this? I also wonder if thats what the original filmmakers/ writers were trying to depict?",1504137600,,706,4.747967479674797
3459329,5,B001AQO3SS,"The most beautiful film of all time! Stunning photography, lavish & opulent sets, incredible costumes. Alex North provides over 4 hrs of masterful music.

Theatrically it was edited down to 3 hrs and was quite the mess. This longer version is a great movie but still it would be incredible to see the longer version.

3459351,4,B001AQO3SS,"I'd have given this Blu Ray the full five stars, except that the film itself is a flawed production.  Even for one, such as myself, who is very fond of big, long epics, this one is overlong and loses steam so radically during the second half that I have never found it easy to sit through.  The thing about this particular edition is that it is such a ravishingly beautiful transfer of a movie that was gorgeously lavish that one can derive great pleasure exploring some of its amazing highlights.  View it on a giant screen, and you will be aghast at the scale of such scenes as Caesar's arrival in the harbor at Alexandria, Cleopatra's spectacular procession as she enters Rome, or the arrival of her astounding golden barge, later in the movie.  The greatest tragedy of this unique blockbuster is that it is so visually splendid and tasteful, much of it, brilliantly written, with some very fine scenes and performances, and an amazing Alex North score..and yet, the whole thing is just too long, too slow and lacks enough exciting epic action and suspense and compelling drama to keep one engaged in the story.  Elizabeth Taylor is ravishing but her work is very uneven.  Richard Burton is good, but his role involves so much seething and agonizing that it grows tiresome.  Still and all, if you love really beautiful, grand scale screen images, these are magnificently reproduced in this two-disc release.",1488844800,4,1410,4.777777777777778

Reviewing performances is subjective. Taylor so beautiful but doesn't compensate fore the fact she can't act. No electricity between Liz and Rex-portraying Ceasar, the first half of the film. But as I said so much to look at. Rex and Liz kissing, most unconvincing kiss I've ever seen. Liz and Richard Burton live up to their tabloid coverage. Burton never at his best on film is acceptable.

3459409,3,B001AQO3SS,"The movie that bankrupted Fox. Originally conceived as a set of two movies, each around 2.5 hours long, or maybe longer, the production ran outof control, and the studio pulled the plug. The result, cut down to a little over 3 hours, was marketed as an event movie, but it lacks punch. It's just long, big, and kind of pointless, partly because there's very little in the way of narrative tissue. Given the scandal at the time surrounding Burton and Taylor's affair, the studio chose to focus the film around the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra, inviting inevitable comparisons with Shakespeare, greatly to the detriment of the film. One wishes that somewhere in the vaults the materials might exist to reconstruct the two-parter, but apparently, they don't, so this one joins the long parade of films that ""might-have-been-great,"" though I have to say, based on the surviving remains, Mankiewitz's direction is flat and uninspired. It's as if he gave over the spectacle to the 2nd Unit guys, the stuntmen, the set-dressers, and so on, and focussed himself on the love story, but was so distracted by the demands of running the production, that he didn't even give the relationship story his full attention. One gets the sense too, that Mankiewitz was never clear about what Taylor's strengths really were, or how to get the best performance out of her; Burton and the other actors seem to be mostly left alone to do what they can with a not very well developed script. Interesting, but deeply flawed and, worst sin of all, boring, for long stretches.",1471478400,2,1561,4.8943396226415095

Andrews Blu-ray Review: How could a film become one of the year's highest grossing films and still manage to be widely regarded as one of Hollywood's biggest flops of all time? Perhaps if a film's budget surges from around $2 million to over $45 million (some reports say $60 million) and takes years rather than the allotted time to shoot, then you have a good justification. Add Elizabeth Taylor's near-fatal illness, director and cast changes during filming, and constant rewrites to the mixture. Then top it all off with an adulterous love affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and you have a perfect recipe for disaster. Well, either that, or just enough scandal and publicity to garner Oscar acclaim and entice curious moviegoers to the theatre. This is exactly what happened when 20th Century Fox released Cleopatra in 1963. It isn't essential to know the tempestuous tale of its making to revel in Joseph L. Mankiewiczs spectacular Cleopatra [1963] feast of literary insight and melodramatic extravagance. It should neither help nor hinder delight in the film to know that it cost more to make than any film to date and reportedly, forty-four million dollars (which would be more than three hundred and thirty million dollars today). But, as with other unduly derided personal and visionary masterworks, such as Heavens Gate and Ishtar, that arose from extended and expensive productions, the budget is often the first thing that is always mentioned, and now with the splendid new restoration Blu-ray release of Cleopatra, which should help to galvanize much more interest into this classic Hollywood film and its deserved place in history, especially when it comes to Joseph L. Mankiewiczs career and in the cinematic firmament of our imagination. After two years in the making, and $7 million spent, Fox had ten minutes of useable footage. Rouben Mamoulian subsequently resigned before shooting resumed, and Taylor suggested Joseph L. Mankiewicz to take his place. Joseph L. Mankiewicz had directed her in Suddenly, Last Summer, for which she earned an Academy Award nomination. He had also directed Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1953, proving his keen sense of classical history. Thus, Joseph L. Mankiewicz seemed like the perfect choice. 20th Century Fox paid out $3 million dollars to secure the director and buy him out of previous obligations.

The London shoot went terribly, due in part to Taylors ill health, in part to her dismay with the script, in part due to Rouben Mamoulians own lack of command, in part due to London weather. Three months of shooting were scrapped in 1961, when Rouben Mamoulian quit and was replaced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Amazingly, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who was, of course, both a writer and a director, was hired to do both jobs. He quickly generated a script outline that was intended to yield two three-hour features: one about Caesar and Cleopatra, the other about Antony and Cleopatra. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Taylors health got worse, landing her in the hospital, near death from pneumonia. When she recovered, the production moved to Rome and started from scratch in September, 1961 and especially with Joseph L. Mankiewicz writing the script at night for the next days action. Meanwhile, the paparazzi (who had only recently been given that immortal name, by Federico Fellini in La Dolce Vita) were making life for Elizabeth Taylor and her then husband, Eddie Fisher, miserable, and became all the more trouble when she began spending lots of time with her Antony, Richard Burton.

The Roman shoot, which ran through June, 1962, featured colossal sets, enormous manpower especially with seven thousand extras for one scene and, for episodes of naval warfare, actual ships (We had to get permission from the local government to rebuild some of the towns bridges.). The last leg of the shoot took place in Egypt later that summer, by which time the head of the studio that had backed the shoot to the bitter end, Spyros Skouras, was forced to resign. His successor, Darryl F. Zanuck, fired Joseph L. Mankiewicz, then rehired him to shoot additional scenes in March, 1963 and then took editorial control, cutting the film into one four-hour feature.

Joseph L. Mankiewiczs Cleopatra is put together with the stuff of legend that the director experienced as personal reality, and he filmed the story as if he had been there. The film may be as close as Hollywood gets, to a cinematic Shakespeare, less in its lucidly incisive, rhetorically reserved images than in its blend of coruscating language, rowdy comedy, and grand yet urgent and intimate performances. The fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton had become an item is obvious from watching the film; the passion that they generate on-screen has a thrillingly spontaneous, electric ardour. The production was cursed and yet, in this regard, it was, perhaps more than any other, blessed. There is so much else that is exciting, like the naval battle of Actium, described with huge dashing galleys and tiny models on a plotting board; the famous orgy on the barge of Cleopatra; the drama of Antony riding out, all alone, deserted by his soldiers, to face the army of Octavian in the final humiliation of himself and his fatalistic love.

There are also so many people who are to be credited with fine work like Roddy McDowall as the sinuous Octavian; Hume Cronyn as the sage Sosigenes, counsellor to Cleopatra; Cesare Danova as her loyal bodyguard; Martin Landau as Rufio, a Roman general, and many more. And there are others to thank like Walter Wanger, who originated and produced the film; Leon Shamroy who directed the photography; and Alex North who wrote the potent stunning musical score.

The dark clouds lingering over Cleopatra's production undoubtedly stained its release, overshadowing the actual quality of the film itself. The plot, Cleopatra using her feminine wiles to stabilise her Egyptian power by seducing Caesar and Marc Antony, seemed almost irrelevant. Audiences were more interested in the romance between Taylor and Burton than Cleopatra and Antony. The film's dialogue was smart and the spectacle was stunning, yet never quite seemed worth the price tag. Over time, Fox did eventually make its money back. In 1966, ABC paid $5 million for two showings, finally putting Cleopatra back into the black.

There may be those who will find the length too tiring, the emphasis on Roman politics a bit too involved and tedious, the luxuriance too much. But unless you are one of those sceptics who are stubbornly predisposed to give Cleopatra the thumbs down. I don't see how you can fail to find this as a generally brilliant, stunning, awesome moving and a totally satisfying film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Youre in the show with Todd-AO as they used to say with this striking and magisterial 2.20:1 transfer presented in this stunning and totally awesome 1080p resolution encoded image is so gorgeous that it sometimes seems almost possible to walk right into the picture. Sharpness is superb throughout without any artificial-looking edge enhancement. Colour saturation is spot-on with reds, purples, and golds being especially memorable. Flesh tones do vary a bit seeming sometimes too tan compared to other times, but that could very well have been due to the shooting locations in Rome which may have baked the skin of some of the actors, and most of the time, skin tones look completely natural and authentic. The film has been divided into 53 chapters over two discs which includes the overture, entracte, and exit music chapters.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The discs offers you the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the 4.0 Dolby Digital sound mixes, and each is a solid aural achievement. Though most of the surround activity is contributed by Alex Norths celebrated score which gets a nice spread through the fronts and rears and accounts for much of the bass used in the channels, there are occasional uses of panning effects through the sound field, as in the Procession into Rome sequence. Dialogue has been superbly recorded and has been placed in the centre channel. And for those who are interested, the entracte music does begin with the Blu-ray Disc 2.

First Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

First Audio Commentary: The commentary starts off with Martin Landau, who talks extensively about the start of the film. He tells us about the different people involved with the film; and it was like a United Nation with all the different nationalists. Martin also informs us that while doing the audio commentary that viewing the film again, that he remembers what went on behind-the-scene, especially how he got on with all the main actors. He also mentions about the way the film is shot, especially where you see the actors sometimes sun tanned and sometimes not, also seeing the actors losing weight and then gaining weight. So all in all this first part of the audio commentary, which ends Martin Landaus part at 1:31:00 and this actors very informative and very intelligent information in telling us the intimate facts on what was involved in the making of Cleopatra. Next up in this particular audio commentary is Tom Mankiewicz at 1:39:19, who is the son of Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Tom mentions how Elizabeth Taylor had a lot of control on what actors or directors were to be allowed to work on the making of Cleopatra, but 20th Century Fox were not keen on having Richard Burton in the film, as they felt at the time he was not film star quality, but of course was totally perfect for the film. Tom also informs us that his Dad had a love / hate battle with Rex Harrison, but despite this, he had a lot of respect with this British actor. Tom also tells us of when there were in Egypt, he tells of the terrible experience when they wanted the local people for the crowd scenes, but because they were illiterate, they then had to bring in young students and nearly had a riot, but with 5 military guys on camels with machine guns, they were able to quell the riot and he felt that would have been the end of filming in Egypt. Tom also informs us of the total nightmare scenario with the paparazzi that was totally out of control, especially when Elizabeth Taylor left the hotel and when Tom walked out with a lookalike Elizabeth Taylor, it took the pressure off the real Elizabeth Taylor, but despite this, they acted like lunatics, especially in Egypt and Rome and so ends Part One of this fascinating and very interesting audio commentary and especially informing us of the historic information on the making of the most talked about Hollywood film of the 20th Century.

Special Feature: The Cleopatra Papers: A Private Correspondence [1963] [1080p] [16:9] Jack Brodsky and Nathan Weiss were publicist for 20th Century Fox during the epic production of Cleopatra. One was stationed in Rome, the other in New York, and then they switched places. Pre-E-mail, Skype, and Non-disclosure agreements, their private correspondence consisted of detailed letters and telegrams, informing each other about the latest battles between director and studio, set politics, and strategies for how to control the explosive press coverage of the infamous Taylor-Burton romance. Originally published in book form in 1963, their communications reveals the true experience of being inside a cinematic tornado. But what you get to see is a series of still images. To start the process you have to press the ENTER button on your remote control and then to continue viewing the images, you have to press the NEXT button on your remote control. Happy Viewing!

Special Feature: Cleopatra Through The Ages: A Cultural History [2011] [1080p] [16:9/2.20:1] [7:51] Here we have a fascinating insight into the historic analogy about Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, and we get a nice contribution for the likes of Stuart Tyson Smith [Professor and Chair of the Anthropology at the UC, Santa Barbara]. He also talks about the different portraits of Cleopatra throughout history and mentions William Shakespeare play Antony and Cleopatra and also compares the Theda Bara film version against the 1963 film. He also feels that the author George Bernard Shaws novel Caesar and Cleopatra was a much more accurate portrayal of the real life Cleopatra. So all in all this is a quite a nice extra, that gives you a lot more information about what made Cleopatra the phenomenon she was and why we are all fascinated by this Egyptian Queen.

Special Feature: Cleopatras Missing Footage [2011] [1080p] [16:9/2.20:1] [8:12] We get a fascinating insight about the missing footage that was deleted from the longer film version and we get to hear from the likes of Brad Geagley [Author/Film Historian] and Schawn Belston [Fox Film Archivist]. When it was originally shot, it ran for over 5 hours, the head of 20th Century Fox objected, as that way they would only be able to show the film once a day and a total loss of earnings. When it premiered in New York on the 2nd June, 1963 it ran for 4 hours and 6 minutes, but on general release in most cinemas, the film the public saw ran for 3 hours and 12 minutes. The two presenters would hope that the missing footage would be eventually found to bring out the ultimate edition on a Blu-ray release. But the version you get to see on this Blu-ray Release is the running time of 4 hours and 6 minutes. Archive photos courtesy of Roger Marguette.

Special Feature: Fox Movie Channel Presents Fox Legacy with CEO Tom Rothman [2011] [480i] [4:3] [29:29] Wow this is a really aggressive in your face, with an equally over the top presenter and I am so glad I don't have to witness this person being broadcast on our British Television, as he is totally obnoxious. But what this so called presenter tells us is just stating the obvious of information we already knew about the film inside information about the film Cleopatra financial disaster. One bonus is you get to see some rare behind-the-scene film clips.

Second Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Second Audio Commentary: With the start of this part two commentaries, we start off where we left off where with the 1st part with Tom Mankiewicz tells us of his Father arriving at Pinewood Studios in the UK and said they were mad to ever contemplate filming in England, because of the terrible wet and damp overcast weather that the UK is prone to and said Italy should been the preferred location and of course the whole Pinewood Studios project had to be abandoned, despite going over budget. But one big problem when they wanted to film in Egypt was their anti-Jewish attitude and in doing so, would not allow certain people into their country, especially Elizabeth Taylor. But because it was rumoured they would lose $8 million of revenue, they dropped their religious objections. Next up is Christopher Mankiewicz at 00:15:34 and he tells us that he was the second assistant director for Cleopatra until January 1962 of that year of filming. He also informs us that originally the sets were built in Hollywood, as well as shooting some scenes. Then they decided to move everything to England, where they did some more filming. Then eventually his Dad demanded it should all be filmed in Rome and eventually is it was a third reincarnation. He also informs us being the second assistant he did not get very intimate with the actors, but preferred to be with the dancers, who he eventually married one of the dancers. Christopher also tells us about how his Dad got the best out of the actors, where they would walk off the set and have a quiet word with them. Then precisely at 1:10:44 Martin Landau comes back to the audio commentary. He talks about scenes where he cried, but the studio decided to cut it from the film, as they felt seeing a man crying was not the done thing. With the battle scenes, Martin informs us that the scene with Andrew Faulds was filmed in Malibu. After that information we don't get much more audio commentary from Martin Landau about the insight into the filming of the battle scenes in Cleopatra. But precisely at 1:23: 20 in comes Jack Brodsky, who informs us that he was the publicist for Cleopatra from the end of 1961, through the Spring of 1962 and at the time of filming his wife had a difficult pregnancy and had to go back to America and was replaced by his good friend Nathan Weiss. We also hear that his hero was the director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who was also a good friend to him, as well as a confident. We get to hear a great insight about the saved correspondence with Jack and Nathan sent to each other, that were kept with the Editor of the Esquire publication, and also tells about Norman mailer had seen the private correspondence and informs Jack they definitely have a successful book on their hands. Jack also tells us that because of the private correspondence and especially the intimate revelation of the affair between Burton and Taylor were having while filming Cleopatra that they were informed by 20th Century Fox that this information should not be included when the book is published. Despite Jack and Nathan doing a big publicity junket on Cleopatra and all what was going on with the filming, but people were only interested in the intimate affair between Burton and Taylor. Despite working 6 days a week in conjunction with the film, Jack and his wife had a brilliant time in Rome, as they had a really nice flat and also informs us that the Italian Restaurants are the best in the world, even compared to the Italian Restaurants in New York City. At precisely 1:51:06 Tom Mankiewicz comes back into the audio commentary again, and he praises the British Actress Francesca Annis, who of course becomes a great stage and film actress. He also praises the British Actor Andrew Keir, who was of those no nonsense actors who lights up the screen, as also all the other British Actors who appeared in the film Cleopatra. Tom also eludes to us that when the film was finished, his Father wanted Cleopatra to be as two separate films and because 20th Century Fox was bankrupt, Darryl F. Zanuck said he would only allow the film to be shown as one film, which broke the heart of Toms father, especially that no one would ever get to view the 6 hour version. So ends another informative audio commentary that was fascinating to hear such intelligent audio conversations from the likes of martin Landau; Tom Mankiewicz; Christopher Mankiewicz and Jack Brodsky. I know that when watches such a long film as Cleopatra and then to have to again watch the 2 Blu-ray discs again with the audio commentary, well be advised, it is well worth the effort, as you get to hear some many intimate facts at the making of Cleopatra, especially what went on behind-the-scenes, plus what the actors were like and the inner thoughts of Martin, Tom, Christopher and Jack on their personal experiences with all aspects of the awesome and spectacular Cleopatra and I give it 10 out of 10 for the professional presentation of especially the audio commentary and one of the best I have heard in a very long time and it has given me so much insight into appreciating Cleopatra even more, than when I first viewed the film in the cinema.

Special Feature: Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood [2001] [480i] [4:3] [1:59:07] This is a Prometheus Entertainment documentary, in association with Van Ness Films; Foxstar Productions; Fox Television Studios and American Movie Classics. This made for American TV Special brings us much more insight into this epic Hollywood classic film Cleopatra and the very interesting audio commentary is narrated by Robert Culp. But before we get into the actual documentary, we get the infamous words from Robert Culp saying, It has been called the most expensive motion picture ever made. It has been called the biggest flop of all time. It is known as a film that nearly bankrupted a Hollywood Studio. And a scandal that set the press into a feeding frenzy. That had the public begging for more. Robert Culp also informs us that for nearly four decades, the story of Cleopatra has been shrouded in rumour and marred by gossip. It is one of the most famous and infamous stories ever put on film. But behind the spectacle, is a true story as compelling and as tragic as anything seen on the screen. It is a story that changed lives, and a film that changed Hollywood forever. Robert Culp also informs us that to the world outside, Hollywood in 1959 were still the place where dreams and fantasies came true, but behind the faade and backlot, there was a run of insidious run of bad luck, that was eating away at their profits.

But as we journey through this nearly 2 hour special documentary, we get contributions from the likes of Roddy McDowall [Actor/1995]; Mel Gussow [Darryl F. Zanuck Biographer/1995]; Jack Brodsky [Publicist for Cleopatra]; David Brown [Former Executive for 20th century Fox]; Joe Hyams [Co-Author of My Life With Cleopatra]; Brad Geagley [Film Historian]; Geoffrey Sharpe [Archivist]; Richard Merryman [Journalist]; Kim Masters [Entertainment Journalist/Author]; Keith Baxter [Actor]; Stephanie Guest [Daughter of Walter Wagner]; Richard Green [Archivist]; Tom Mankiewicz [Son of Joseph L. Mankiewicz]; Hume Cronyn [Actor]; Chis Mankiewicz [Son of Joseph L. Mankiewicz]; Rosemary Mankiewicz [Wife of Joseph L. Mankiewicz]; John Karlsen [Actor]; Brook Williams [Friend of Richard Burton]; Martin Landau [Actor]; Carey Harrison [Son of Rex Harrison]; C.O. Doc Erickson [Production Manager for Cleopatra]; Richard Zanuck [Former Production Chief]; Robert Wagner [Actor]; Maureen OHara [Actress]; Bill Mechanic [Former President of 20th Century Fox] and Nick Redman [Music Producer].

What is really interesting and fascinating about this Special Documentary is all the intrigue surrounding of the making of Cleopatra, plus all the gossip and the scandal relating to the so called secret affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. We also get to hear about the runaway budget that nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox and no one knew how to stop this rollercoaster disaster from ever happening and whether 20th Century Fox would ever survive the massive debt they incurred because of the bloated budget in bringing Cleopatra to the silver screen. But what we also get to see a lot of behind-the-scene rare look at the making of Cleopatra. But even better is the very nice dedication near the end of this epic Special Documentary of the main contributors to this epic Hollywood film and it reads as follows: Richard Burton [1908-1990]; Rex Harrison [1908-1990]; Joseph L. Mankiewicz [1909-1993]; Walter Wagner [1984-1968] and Roddy McDowall [1928-1998]. But I think the final comment by Robert Culp, sums up the love and affection we all have for Cleopatra, when he says, Cleopatra, is a name that conjures mystery, power and seduction. It is also a name that has come to suggest opulence, grandeur and great excess. It is the name of one of the most intriguing women who has ever lived. In the name of one of the greatest and infamous films, ever made.

Special Documentary: The Fourth Star of Cleopatra [2001] [480i] [4:3] [9:06] With this special documentary, the commentator refers to who the fourth star is of Cleopatra and that is the production itself and all the behind-the-scene crew who helped to make Cleopatra what it is today and the process of all the technical knowhow in bringing this epic film to the silver screen. Narrated by Phil Tomken.

Fox Movietone News: Archival Footage of the New York Premiere [1963] [480i] [4:3] [6:00] This is split into two instalments of the 20th Century Fox chronicle of the lavish American premieres of 'Cleopatra.' The first one provides archival footage from the New York opening, and includes appearances by such luminaries as Rex Harrison, Roddy McDowell, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Helen Hayes, Joan Fontaine, Red Buttons, composers Richard Rodgers and Leonard Bernstein, and the 20th Century Fox chief Darryl F. Zanuck, while the second takes us to Hollywood and then Washington, D.C. for their respective premieres. In L.A., Rex Harrison, Malcolm McDowell, Lucille Ball, and Rosalind Russell are among the celebrities attending, while a parade of U.S. senators and diplomatic dignitaries walk the red carpet in the nations capital.

Theatrical Trailers: Trailer A [1963] [480i] [2.20:1] 4:39]; Trailer B [1963] [480i] [16:9] [00:45] and Trailer C [1963] [480i] [2.20:1] [4:39] What is quite intriguing is basically Trailer A and C are the same print, but with Trailer C you get a slightly different voice over and a lot more extra wording appearing on the screen.

BONUS: The stunning beautiful Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook acts as a case that holds the 2 Blu-Ray discs and includes the 28 page booklet which is full of stunning colour printed pages, which is well worth purchasing just for this and also has absolutely fascinating information about the film, as well as the director and some of the main actors in the film.

Finally, all that philosophical hoo-ha aside, the Cleopatra 50th Anniversary Blu-ray is a visually-stunning reminder of pre-CGI, cinematic splendour. Every set, costume, and stroke of the makeup brush is visible in gorgeous detail. Each high resolution gleam of the films golden gilding explains its $44 million production budget. Joseph L. Mankiewiczs Cleopatra redefined the boundaries of the Hollywood epic, even as it faltered in its storytelling. No matter your opinion on the movie itself, you have to respect that Cleopatra has been cemented into film history. The 50th Anniversary Blu-ray does justice to the films complete legacy honouring it while not shying away from its troubled production. This is definitely a must-have for any film for any film buffs out there. This Blu-ray release from 20th Century Fox, it is pure reference quality and you will get total euphoria, that will sure to dazzle 100%. Very Highly Recommended!

3459709,5,B001AQO3SS,"I was 12 when this movie came out and remember seeing it in the theater, and what a spectacle it was. But I definitely did not appreciate the story line as much as I do now after 50 years of following politics and reading about world history and how events are shaped in many cases by the force of a single individual or a small group. The story is fairly true to the historical record, but whether or not it is totally accurate it's still a great story.
The sets are stunning and of course were done before CGI made it easy to simulate an entire city or add a cast of thousands. No wonder it broke the record for cost. The cast is stellar, even aside from Burton and Taylor who are wonderful to watch. The restoration is terrific, very well done.
And talk about strong women in movies - Cleopatra is clearly the strongest character in this movie. She knows exactly what needs to be done in order to become ruler of the world - if only these stupid men would get with the program and listen to her.
Overall this movie is great fun to watch for many reasons - Taylor, Burton, the at times over-the-top sets, the story, etc., etc. Even though it is four hours long, it's engrossing and easy to take in in one sitting. How many movies are there that can hold an audience for that long?",1425686400,3,1282,4.258196721311475

3459711,5,B001AQO3SS,"Like so many fans of Elizabeth Taylor, I recall watching this movie for the first time in the 1970s. I liked it even though it was quite lengthy. I love period epic movies and this one was right up there with several others. Elizabeth Taylor, one of three well known actresses that have portrayed the Queen of Egypt, did a fantastic job. The costumes and everything were just gorgeous. Although, not quite sure the real Cleopatra looked like this. I don't care, it is a beautiful movie with an all star cast. For the time, it was plagued with over budget and delays. Every movie has had this in some form one way or another. Originally, the movie that was shot was much longer than the one we have presented here for us. There is still missing footage from this movie. Upon the premiere that Elizabeth went to I believe she became really upset by the cut footage. It was believed that it was too lengthy for theatrical release.
I am pleased with this visually stunning film released by Fox for the 50th Anniversary Edition here. The detail is just magnificent and may be the best version ever to be made on a home video format. All previous releases don't compare to this one. I have watched this on my 50"" Ultra 4K and it is nothing short of spectacular!
The digibook that it is housed in is just gorgeous! Well done with pictures inside of some of the notable characters from the film. Blu-rays are housed in nice pockets, easy to get removed and put back in. This could be one of the very best Blu-rays to ever be made. Just my thoughts and I own over 400 Blu-rays as of this writing.

3459890,4,B001AQO3SS,"I remember seeing Cleopatra in the movies in about 1963 or 1964. Iwas about 13 or 14 and thought it was a fairly slow-moving film.  Watched it again this weekend on this 50th anniversary blu-ray edition and I have some thoughts.
This is the four hour and 6 minute roadshow edition that was shown on a reserved-seat basis.  The picture on this blu-ray is stunningly pristine, one of the best I've seen yet.  The sound is excellent also.
As for the film itself, it is fairly interesting and enjoyable watching it on blu-ray where you can stop and go at your leisure.
As for the performances, Taylor is okay as Cleopatra, nothing extraordinary.  Burton overacts like crazy as Mark Antony.  Furthermore, I forgot what a weak and insipid character he becomes after becoming besotted with Cleopatra.  He spends most of the second disk moping and whining over Cleopatra until the film's tragic conclusion.  (It was interesting that studio head Darryl F. Zanuck felt the same way.  On a very good two hour documentary on ""Cleopatra, the Film that Changed Hollywood,"" it is revealed that Zanuck was surprised about what a weak character Anthony was, upon viewing the film for the first time.  I absolutely concur.)
Of the three leads, Rex Harrison is far and away the best as the charismatic Julius Caesar.  The films definitely loses something when Caesar is assassinated and the second half is nowhere as good as the first.  Harrison received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this film and he deserved it.  (He lost, but would win the Oscar the next year as Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady.)
Roddy McDowall gives a terrific supporting performance in this film.  (It is revealed in the aforementioned documentary that McDowall was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor due to a clerical error by the studio putting his name into the Best Actor, not Supporting Actor, category.)  I totally forgot that one of my favorites, Martin Landau, appears in a major role as Ruffio, a General loyal to both Caesar and Antony.  (I met Landau once, he was a very nice gentleman.)  Carroll O'Connor appears briefly as a very miscast Casca. (Most of his performance must have wound up on the cutting room floor.)
The action scenes are okay, nowhere as good as many of the other epic spectaculars of its day.  (On the documentary previously mentioned, there is a very brief  shot of its New York premiere at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway.  A couple blocks away, the marquee of the Cinerama theater can be seen which, at that time, was showing the roadshow version of How The West Was Won.  Now there is a film I truly love.)
Cleopatra won four Oscars including Special Effects beating Hitchcock's far superior The Birds.  I read where Hitchcock was quite annoyed by this and he had a right to be, the effects in The Birds were far more interesting and exciting than Cleopatra..
The two disk set includes trailers and the first disk has a nice short documentary originally shown on the Fox Movie. Channel comparing Fox's two out of control productions: Cleopatra and Titanic.  (Speaking of ""out of control,"" Cleopatra cannot be spoken about without mentioning the scandalous affair between Taylor and Burton during the making of this film.  As one who remembers this period well, it is hard to describe what a big deal this was.  One could not pick up a newspaper or magazine without reading about it.  Today's Hollywood morons are almost out of control on a daily basis, we are never surprised by their obnoxious behavior.  However in 1963, this out-of-wedlock affair was something out of the ordinary and, as stated, a real big deal.)
In conclusion, I enjoyed watching this blu-ray edition of Cleopatra.  It is great to look out and, while not a great film, it was nowhere as tiring as I remember it being.",1399766400,8,3799,4.769113149847095

3459901,5,B001AQO3SS,"Sure, Cleopatra's acting is a bit hackneyed, but the set design, costumes, lighting, photography, and ""cast of thousands"" make this a visual feast not to be missed. There is jaw-dropping eye candy in nearly every scene, and the Blu-ray transfer shows this off to best effect. The attention to detail by the artists who worked on this film is breathtaking. Even if this were a silent film it would be worth seeing.

The 4 hours fly by due to the variety on display, from individual Elizabeth Taylor costumes that must have cost $1m in 2014 dollars, to gigantic show-stopping Cecil B. De Mille-style statement scenes, to the lighting design that shows it's possible to light a color film with all the contrast and style of a landmark black & white picture.

This is an absolute must-see if for no other reason than there will never be another film like this. As you watch Cleopatra always remember there is no CGI here.

3459921,5,B001AQO3SS,"I have to give all the credit to this film to the original cinematographer and
the TODD-AO 65mm process.  Without their great initial work the restoration
would not have been as good.  I would say the picture is a little soft, but
not really noticeable, colors are bright and even, I'm sure this is a good as
anyone would have seen from the rear of the theater at the original roadshow.

A highly underrated film.  I watched on two different nights.  I agree to long for one
sitting.  Its basically two movies,  one before Caesar died and one after.  I do
think Joan Collins could have worked in this role, but Liz Taylor was still a great choice.
Sorry to hear that it didn't make money till the 70's though.  38 million in 1963 !  wow.  Its
amazing 20th Century survived.  The theory this film flopped is untrue.  The Longest Day
saved its bacon during production, and it did make 28 million by 1966 or so.  So it really
may have saved the studio in the end, I think the criticism is unjust now I've seen the film.
Certainly great performances throughout.  I would put it on a par with Spartacus, but not
Ben Hur.  Script editing would have helped if Mankewiez had had time, but he didn't so
we are reduced to 4 hours,  the butchered cut I've never seen and I'm glad.  3 and 1/2 hours
would be better and you can see where some stuff could be cut, but I understand originally it
was nearly 6 hours.  Still a great film and well worth you taking the time out of your life
to watch it, especially if you like history or Richard Burton.",1390867200,,1535,4.304195804195804

3459928,5,B001AQO3SS,"...even on DVD. There will never be a movie quite like CLEOPATRA again when you consider when it was made. While James Cameron has given us TITANIC and AVATAR which surpassed CLEOPATRA in expense and certainly in box office and Peter Jackson has mined the works of J.R.R. Tolkein with great success, CLEOPATRA was the green light for that type of film and it's still shining brightly after 50 years. In fact the film looks better today than it did in 1963. Part of the reason for that is the fact that now we can see it in the version which is close to what writer-director Joseph L. Manciewicz (ALL ABOUT EVE) wanted us to see. Two separate love stories contained in two 2 hour films. Part 1 - CAESAR & CLEOPATRA and Part 2 -  ANTONY & CLEOPATRA. Manciewicz certainly didn't lack chutzpah for taking on George Bernard Shaw in the first film and Shakespeare in the second. With the help of a once in a lifetime cast of American and British actors, Elizabeth Taylor at her loveliest, Rex Harrison at his most regal, and Richard Burton at his most powerful, the film manages to both entertain and enthrall in equal measure.

After seeing this 50th Anniversary Edition, I was surprised at how compelling it was. Unbelievable grandeur, eye-popping costumes, magnificent widescreen photography, an effective music score, and at least a dozen memorable performances that bring the literate script to life. After CLEOPATRA's premiere at 248 minutes, Fox cut the film to 192 minutes to increase showings and a lot of important details were lost. Today a two or even three part release would have been pre-ordained (think LORD OF THE RINGS or THE HOBBIT). This 50th Anniversary DVD (and Blu-Ray) restores the premiere version and shows Elizabeth Taylor at the top of her game. People always complain how she dragged Burton down but I think it was the other way around for she was rarely this good again and never as beautiful as she is here. If you've never seen CLEOPATRA uncut then you really need to. It comes from an age when Hollywood epics had something to say as well as something to show off. While the Blu-Ray is a knockout, this DVD is a close second and can be played on many more devices. It's also usually available at a better price and loaded with special features as well.",1387929600,,2279,4.652605459057072

3459985,4,B001AQO3SS,"This production served as writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's obsession for many years and became, at the time, the most expensive movie ever made. Here's one of the reasons: He shut down for six months the shooting of the gigantically staged, eight-minute scene of Cleopatra's arrival in Rome. Why? Because he didn't like the way the sunlight was illuminating the setting (yes, it did look better later). Actually, Cleopatra is two love stories, and the first is much better than the second - which is good, because at four hours-plus you might want to bail out at the halfway point. The first half is similar to Shakespeare's play, ""Caesar and Cleopatra."" It covers the meeting and mating of Julius Caesar, the (de facto) Emperor of Rome, with the Queen of Egypt, and their verbal fencing and growing friendship and love are truly captivating. The second occurs after Caesar's assassination and involves the romance between the queen and Marc Antony, with lots of intrigue and enormous naval battle scenes (with life-size ships) thrown in. But it's not enough to halt your waning interest. Rex Harrison is superb as Caesar, playing him with considerable charm and wit, and Elizabeth Taylor shines in all her glory in the title role. Their interplay is among the best chemistry ever seen on the screen. But Richard Burton is dull and humorless as Antony, and he eventually brings down the whole movie.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378857600,,1656,5.708502024291498

3460020,4,B001AQO3SS,"I ordered this digibook edition when preorder was announced. However, I did not view the film as I was waiting for it to be shown in Sydney following the Cannes festival. This is a film that must be seen if possible in a theatre on a very large screen. Luckily, many of us had that opportunity this past weekend in Sydney at the magnificent art deco palace that is the Cremorne Orpheum. Exhibited in 4K High Definition on the 70MM screen ""Cleopatra"" looked and sounded superb. All that money that it cost back in the early 60's was there onscreen.  It is a fine film. It is a great entertainment. It is NOT an action movie, but the storyline holds the viewer's interest over the 243 minute running time. And of course Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison demand your attention. So how does the bluray compare? It is the next best thing if you cannot see Cleopatra in a cinema. It is a restoration that is a credit to all those responsible at 20th Century Fox. Despite the criticism this epic piece of cinema has attracted over the years since it was originally released, it does occupy an important place in film history and should be in any film lover's collection. Just one minor criticism of the bluray - the overture, entr'acte and exit music should play over a dark screen, not the lush red curtains Fox gives us on this release.",1375142400,2,1347,4.520491803278689
3460021,5,B001AQO3SS,"Cleopatra has been unfairly maligned due to its troubled production history, cost overruns that nearly took down an already troubled studio and a tabloid romance that was the granddaddy of them all. This massive, glorious epic may have come close to killing its oscar-winning director Joseph Mankiewitcz, who was shooting on massive sets with thousands of extras by day and madly re-writing the script by night. Originally meant by the director to be two films --three hours each, it ended up being released as a four hour film & then quickly truncated to an even shorter length. That said, it is still a good film, not the masterpiece that the director was aiming for, but a truly good film, particularly if viewed on a REALLY BIG SCREEN, which it was intended for. It was shot in 70mm and if you ever have the chance to see it in 70mm in a theater, DO IT! This beautifully restored blu ray is the original 4 hour Roadshow version. The first half which follows Caesar & Cleopatra is truly remarkable and the second half, following Antony and Cleopatra --the most affected by studio-mandated chopping --is better in this longer version and even better on a bigger screen, as one is able to pick up on more subtle elements of Burton's performance.
There are great extras on the disc, including a 2 hour documentary on the improbable history of the creation of this film.",1375056000,,1369,4.708333333333333

Living in Los Angeles, only a couple of miles from where this movie was made, it was always interesting to see front page news on the events surrounding this massive production. Nearly every day there was a headline about ""Liz and Dick"". One day they were falling in love, the next day breaking up. Whatever publicity stunt could be manufactured, surely was. The tabloids were full of articles, both true and false: and usually right in between. As a teenager, I loved it. But the funny thing is, I never saw the film!  Now, despite what the critics and film historians say about this film, I own it and will love watching it 50 years later. It might be slow, in epic style no less, but it's still film history and should be studied by students all over the world who love the background of film production as much as the film itself.

3460058,4,B001AQO3SS,"In all honesty, I couldn't wait to see this film and for several reasons.  While I had seen it as a kid and as a young man, both in the theater and on TV, I don't remember too much about it beyond the gilded spectacle of many of the scenes.  Of course the film has a reputation befitting the scope of the project.  I'll toss out a few eye-popping facts for those interested in the financial aspects.  The film was made for about $60 million on a budget of $44 million.  By today's standards this would earn a big yawn.  Adjusted for inflation, however that $60 million becomes $467 million and now we have something to talk about.  Elizabeth Taylor was the biggest female movie star of the day and I had understood her salary for the film was $1 million, certainly a staggering amount at the time.  But she was much smarter.  Her actual salary was negotiated down to $750K but she also received 10% of the gross.  On top of that, her salary was based on a 16 week shooting schedule.  She was paid another $50 thousand a week after that.  The movie had many starts and stops, including a long hiatus when Taylor became seriously ill.  Many scenes had to be reshot as actors came and went.  After it was all over Ms. Taylor made about $7 million and again, adjusted for inflation that would be about $54 million.  Not bad.

After a fitful start with director Rouben Mamoulian, Fox chairman Spyros Skouras brought in Joseph L. Mankiewicz to direct and rewrite the screenplay.  Mankiewicz understandably was overwhelmed but was paid a lot of money.  He wanted 2 films, but that idea was shot down, so here we have ""Cleopatra"" now on Blu ray, all 4 hours and 11 minutes.  The earlier version I had seen ran about an hour shorter.  The broad outline of the story is backed by historical evidence.

Julius Caesar was played by Rex Harrison and for my money gave the best performance.  He in fact was a second choice to Peter Finch who bailed, because of previous commitments, when the schedule ran long.  Caesar was left to administer Egypt after the previous King insisted the country be co-ruled by Cleopatra (Taylor) and her younger brother, Ptolemy (Richard O'Sullivan).  Ptolemy, however had booted Cleopatra out of Alexandria, to rule alone along with his older lackeys who were actually in charge.  Caesar reinstalls Cleo and sends Ptolemy off to a certain death.  Caesar, delays his return to Rome and is co-opted by Cleopatra's womanly charms.  She is a worthy political consultant as well.  Eventually they marry, although Caesar is already married but without children.  Cleo bares him a son known as Caesarion.

Caesar returns to Rome in triumph and a couple years later Cleopatra enters Rome with probably half the film's budget up on the screen.  It is a gem and certainly what I remember as a kid.  At over an hour into the picture Marc Antony (Richard Burton) shows up for the first time.  Again, the shooting schedule precluded the original choice to play Antony (Stephen Boyd), to continue, so changes had to be made.  Influenced by Cleopatra, Caesar demands that the senate designate him Emperor of Rome and all its conquered states.  The senate refuses in the harshest of ways.  The senators assassinate Caesar, with Brutus (Kenneth Haigh) applying the final blow.

Octavian (Roddy McDowall) assumes leadership as Caesar Augustus and sends Antony to Egypt to negotiate for grain and coin to keep the Roman army and navy in a ready state of plunder.  Antony of course, is an easy touch for Cleopatra but in reality they do fall in love.  As a footnote, history suggests that Cleopatra had 3 children with Antony but that is never dealt with in the film.  When the final conflict between Rome and Egypt comes to pass, Antony again at Cleo's suggestion decides to fight the battle at sea.  Big mistake.  In the end, they take their own lives.  He by self-inflicted sword, she by snake bite.  The End.

""Cleopatra"" isn't as bad as most critics suggest, but the 4 hour running time will certainly test your patience, even if you are a lover of melodramatic soap opera.  That in reality is what the film is.  Big budget soap.  It's very talky and with very little action.  The sets and costumes are opulent and beautifully photographed.  The movie is spectacular from that perspective.  It looks big.  It is big.  The numerous back stories, especially the scandal involving Burton and Taylor's off screen love affair will keep ""Cleopatra"" alive for years to come.

Most fans of the film will certainly want to own it on one of the Blu ray versions.  I watched the 2 disc 50th Anniversary edition.  The transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.20:1 aspect ratio.  And it looks great.  The studio has done a really fine job with this aging film.  It has excellent detail, beautiful color and excellent flesh tones (often needed!).  I could detect no artifacts.  The audio as well is pristine with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option in addition to Dolby Digital 4.0.  ""Cleopatra"" has an excellent score by Alex North and it shows up well.  In addition to majestic trumpets, deep throated strings and drums are often in play in the surrounds.  The subwoofers will see some action.  Here are the bonus features:

3460070,4,B001AQO3SS,"SUPURB transfer both video and sound.  I had gotten the edition released in UK earlier and this is equal to it or better in terms of picture and sound.  The movie has always been a favorite and I think was trashed by critics at time of release because of the Liz and Dick ""scandal,"" and the enormous (for the time) budget every bit of which is on the screen.

I have the booklet sold at reserve seat showings in '63 (yes I am that old), and had hoped the blu-book would be the same, so perhaps I am a bit prejudiced.  The book does have some glorious photographs, and decent information in it, just not as complete as the original souvenir, and with additional information concerning the history of the film over the past 50 years.

Though Harrison was nominated for academy award, think Liz was overlooked for her personal life decisions.  Her work here is every bit as successful as in ""WAoVW"" with its scheming seduction, to retain power of a decadent state, yet the human desires of the young woman is clearly present.

Do wonder if there will be problems with the Harrison estate over Liz and Dick pictures on discs.  I recall Rex having to be painted into the original art work for the film (including the HUGE billboard in Times Square), as his contract called for absolutely EQUAL billing.

Buy it, enjoy it, and revel in life before CGI films.  May the cinema gods be kind and find the missing footage for the two pictures Manchievitz had planned - probably lost forever as doc says, but we can always hope.",1371686400,2,1516,4.5

I sat down to watch it and thought I would be bored half way through. To my surprise I hardly realized the time passed. I will say I watched it over two days. Certainly, no one could match Elizabeth Taylor's beauty and was the perfect pick to play the Egyptian queen. Rex Harrison was superb, as he always is and RIchard Burton, although he came off as something of a wimp, played the part well. Roddy McDowell was a great Octavian and I really enjoyed his performance. I watched the extras on the DVD and found out that he was supposed to be nominated for best performance in a supporting role, but do to a glitch was nominated instead for a starring role and didn't win. He would have almost surely won if he had be placed in the right catagory. What a shame for such a talented actor. I know I will enjoy watching this film over and over again. As usual in my reviews, I don't get too technical or rattle off the names of all the behind the scenes directors and so on, But let me say that just looking at Irene Sharaf's costume design was worth the price of the DVD. Of course the fact that Ms. Taylor was wearing them helped. You should get this film for the pure pleasure of looking at the richness of the colors and the brilliance of those who saw this an epic film even if it did cost 40 million or so to make.",1371427200,5,1544,4.237288135593221

3460075,4,B001AQO3SS,"This BluRay Book version of Cleopatra is fabulous. The picture quality is remarkable, and seeing the entire movie in widescreen for perhaps the first time in my life was a unique experience. The detail in the picture is sharp and very life-like. Many visual subtleties come through that I haven't noticed before. There's a great feeling of depth in the image, a depth that's necessary for the many scenes that were staged on huge open spaces depicting grand palaces and cities. Remarkable!

I usually find myself drifting off if not falling asleep when this movie is aired on broadcast TV, especially if the movie is interrupted and cut up by commercials. Seeing the movie in its entirety without breaks gave me a new appreciation for the direction, pacing and editing of this film that I hadn't had previously. This film is heavy with dialogue. Seeing it uninterrupted and in widescreen helps the dialogue flow in a natural way that fights against it becoming turgid.

I found myself gaining new respect for the acting of Elizabeth Taylor. It's funny, but watching the BluRay, I did not for an instant believe she was an Egyptian while at the same time I found her acting to be quite believable. Richard Burton has his share of over-the-top, stagey moments, but they actually work in the context of this 4-hour movie, as they're few and far between. Those speeches aren't as stagey when the actor is framed in a widescreen shot, as opposed to the close-up one got in the old pan-n-scan versions. Rex Harrison is well-night perfect as Caesar, and the supporting cast is balanced and highly accomplished.

The packaging is also very nice. The BluRay book itself comes in a slipcase that should mitigate against wear and tear, while the pages in the book supply some stills and a bit of interesting text.

What's kept me from giving this BD a 5-star rating is the sound, which is cramped even in its surround mode and which gets distorted at a few points. There's an edge to the voices at times as well. That said, the large-vista and heavily populated scenes DO gain quite a bit from the surround sound, no more so than in the scenes where armies and horses are heard moving about.

All in all this is a BD well worth owning. The extras on the discs are substantial and added to my appreciation of the film.

Highly recommended.",1370908800,6,2327,4.6911764705882355

The clarity of the images are fantastic and consistent.  You watch a film like this and understand the incredible money and craftmanship that went into the BIG look of the film long before a green screen and computerized alterations existed.  The brilliant images of faces, costumes, and sets are exactly what blu-ray can deliver.
The sound quality also holds up well.  It's still amazing to me what high definition can do with older 60's movies if handled properly, and this one is an excellent example.  If you are a real movie fan, and want to see a big picture production in your High def home theater, then this is your cup of tea.  You will not be disappointed.

This one is worth buying just to see what an incredible beauty Elizabeth Taylor was.  My god, forget the anorexic media images jammed down our throats that is supposed to pass for beauty, this is what a beautiful woman is supposed to look like.

3460080,3,B001AQO3SS,"Liz Taylor, as I like to remember her. Beautiful, melodramatic and full of spunk.
The ever handsome Richard Burton, also her real-life husband.
The chemistry they had in this film is clearly understood, even if you didn't know their history.
I remember my mom watching this movie when I was a kid, and I walked in the room and sat down. I watched for a few minutes, it was a scene where Liz and Burton were kissing, wait, they did that a lot, anyway, it stayed fresh in my mind but other than that I really didn't remember much. I was glad to be able to sit and watch this movie in its' entirety. People all know the story of Cleopatra, but Liz shows you how cunning she was for Egypt, and what lengths she would go through to keep it her Egypt.
The only thing I noticed that made me outright laugh at how movies were made ""back in the day"" is a few set errors or editing. For example, in one scene I noticed a red directors chair decorated with gold. My first reaction was, ""there were no directors chairs in old Egypt"". Yup, I went there... LOL... then a little while later Liz had this beautiful golden piece of jewelry in her hair with a red silk robe on. Burton had his armor on, and they were arguing while walking through the room. Next thing you know, the scene changes from one room to the next, and both of the cast members looked totally different. Liz had no gold anything in her hair and a dark robe on, and where did his armor go?! Man, I laughed....
But the story itself is what you watch it for, not the humorous mistakes of a classic movie. I mean, for the age it was made in, it was amazing!!
Definitely worth a watch, blips and all, if you haven't seen it.",1370390400,,1675,4.204968944099379
3460081,5,B001AQO3SS,"It's a shame the bad rap this film has gotten over the years. To paraphrase the New York Times in its rave review at Cleopatra's opening - this is great epic entertainment, and unless you are predisposed to give Cleopatra the needle, it is a hugely satisfying and stirring spectacle. One of the common themes in many of the notices posted here on Amazon is the shock & pleasure of viewers who were surprised at how literate and beautiful the film really is. They had expected a travesty, a colossal eyesore ineptly acted. Over & over again the theme is replayed - low expectations giving way to astonishment at how fine the film really is....and always was. And now especially in this blu-ray edition.

With this film Elizabeth Taylor transcended her then considerable stardom, and became to millions the worldover THE ELIZABETH TAYLOR of legend, a veritable modern Cleopatra of wealth, excess, and star-crossed romance. This transformation was fueled by Taylor & Burton's very public adultery inviting the censure of the Vatican concerning her fitness as a mother, and debate by the United States Senate about revoking Taylor's citizenship on the grounds she was a threat to public morals. Adding fire to the inferno was Taylor becoming the highest paid ""million-dollar plus a piece of the boxoffice"" performer in entertainment history. Scandal did not seem to taint her.

At its opening, the critical opinion to Cleopatra was decidedly mixed - everything from raves to scorn....as would be expected when the director's 6 hour/2 film vision was whittled down to 1 film at 4+ hours, and then later for general release, cut again to 3+ hours. In reading some of the reviews at the time it becomes glaringly clear that many critics got insultingly personal and reviewed the highly paid sexual femme fatale rather than the actress' nuanced performance, finding it impossible to separate the two. And to blame Taylor for the astronomical costs is absurd. The remarkable DVD includes the documentary ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood"", which is a very thoughtful accurate attempt to correct this myth. From the start, the cast and director/writer were forced by a mismanaged 20th Century Fox to shoot from an incomplete script, practically in sequence - the most inefficient way to shoot a film.

The film was a boxoffice hit - not the flat-out bomb the film's detractors wished for. It was number 1 on Variety's Weekly Boxoffice charts month after month. It was the number one grossing film of 1963. Cleopatra continued to perform well in 1964. And as the above documentary states, it was one of the 1960s top moneymakers. No film with bad word of mouth plays at theaters for 6 to 15 months at roadshow prices in city after city. It just doesn't happen. The fact is that audience reaction to the film was much more positive than the critical reception.

Having said all of that, let me articulate why so many people love this film.

* Cleopatra has a great literate script. A very complex story of empire, dynastic ambition and love is rendered understandable and compelling. And the story it tells is remarkably accurate - some liberties are taken but the general arc of how history unfolded is correct

* The relationship between the 3 leads is well thought out and the dynamics in their performances shift accordingly. Caesar and Cleopatra have a relationship of ambitious peers who respect each other and agree to mutually use each other - their dialog fairly crackles with wit and innuendo. Antony and Cleopatra from the beginning are doomed. In spite of herself, her political judgement is compromised by her love. And he is besotted with her, living in Caesar's shadow.

* Taylor's Cleopatra is a complex compelling woman of force and dignity, fired by a fierce ambition to protect Egypt's independence and rule the world. In her is embodied the woman, the ruler, the statesman, and the exoticness of the ancient East. To the movie-going public at the time, she was the only actress beautiful enough and talented enough to play this role. At this point in her career, she had already been Oscar nominated 4 times and would be again for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".

* The opulence of the production is staggering......Alex Norths music is stunning - remastered and rereleased by Varese Sarabande, it is one of the great original compositions for the screen. The costumes and headdresses are a sensational example of Hollywood craft and art. And a film on this physical scale would be impossible to produce today. I saw this film screened at MOMA in New York in the early 1990s as part of a 20th Century Fox retrospective. The reaction to the sets, the sheer size of the production, the attempt to recreate the exotic grandeur of ancient Egypt was an eye-opener for those in the audience seeing the film for the first time. From the entrance into Rome, to the barge at Tarsus, to the Battle of Actium and so forth there is one gorgeous set-piece after another.

* The intersection of art and life is the final factor at play. Here is where began one of the most potent and public of film partnerships - lived on screen and in the tabloids for close to 15 years. Whether you approved or disapproved of Taylor & Burton, there are few if any stars nowadays that can project that glamorous larger than life aura as they did. And that, coupled with the spectacle of the film's production - the gossip, the flood of news, the outrage, the money being spent to bring the story to the screen, the crises, and so forth - would simply not occur nowadays.",1370304000,11,5562,4.815706806282723

3460083,3,B001AQO3SS,"Oh my.  Just want to see if anyone else agrees with me.  If you loved watching Elizabeth Taylor on celluloid through the 70mm high definition lenses of the TODD-AO film process before this Blu-ray version came out, then you like me will be aghast at what you will see here!  Look at how pale the face of Richard Burton appears in this DVD, compared with the SD DVD version and you will know that this 50th Anniversary Edition has stripped away the TODD-AO soft focusing projection effect. Elizabeth Taylor never looked so unappealing as Cleopatra, as she does in this epic disaster: of film to digital transfer.  It would not have been difficult to reduce pixel sharpness on the close-ups of Elizabeth and Richard, whereas the medium close-up and long shots are quite appealing and the clarity looks excellent.

Note that every image of Liz, Dick and Rex in the booklet and on the cover, has been dramatically softened and retouched. I'm certain if Joseph Mankiewicz, Mike Todd and cinematographer Leon Shamroy were alive today, they would give thumbs down to this DVD, similar to the bad reviews the original feature garnered in 1963.  Do I recommend you buy this?  Yes I do. Enjoying it with love in your heart for a truly epic motion picture, is a different option.  **UPDATE*  Thank you for giving thumbs up or down for my review, the thumbs down win, and I am awarding an additional STAR, from two to three.  ;-)",1370217600,8,1417,4.67741935483871

Is she gorgeous?  Not really.  Lots of sparkles on the eyes and odd makeup and I highly doubt that the real Cleopatra ever even looked this way.

In truth, this film is nothing more than a silent flick all gussied up in Technicolor and a gargantuan budget and the whole thing collapses under its own weight.

Hardly a classic, but it's a role Taylor will be forever identified with.

3460101,5,B001AQO3SS,"I did a side by side comparison of the UK all region and the new US version. Here are a few of the improvements.

The CLARITY in the US version is like looking through a plate glass window. Not just in selected scenes, but through the entire movie. You'll know in the first 30 seconds of the pop up menu as it roams through a few scans until you hit the play button.

Example#1 the blue dress that Liz is wearing on the barge as she stands under a canopy, now shows the PATTERN of the dress better than before.

Example#2 the slaves that carry Liz down off the black sphinx had SILVER colored paint that looked like lighting bolts got COLOR CORRECTED and now show the true color of GOLD lightning bolts that MATCH the GOLD BRACELETS, that match the GOLD throne Liz sits on that match the gold dress THAT LIZ WEARS. All previous disks don't have it right with the silver color.

Example #3 On the barge that meet Marc Anthony, at the banquet, Liz shows up wearing a sheer white gown on all the old disks. The new US disk now color corrected, shows the there is a lovely pale pink of the most delicate shade and the white sheer is actually a overlay kind of see through cape?( Sorry I do not know what it is called in fashion lingo.

Example#4 in a battle scene, where the roman legions make what is called ""the turtle"" formation ( Men on the inside, shields and spears on the outside) You see amazing clarity on the designs on the shields. And this is in a scene filmed IN LOW LIGHT!

Example#5 in the entry into Rome - The African dancers have straw fringes on their arms and legs. The GREEN color now pops in new clarity, To be fair the old disks showed some color ,but not like this.

ODD? because of this new clarity, I noticed that there are TWO white pyramids in the background. You see the first after the semi nude lady dances. then a group of females appears with gold colored wings and behind that is the pyramid with the pigeons getting released. After Liz bows to Cesar, the camera cuts to a background shout of the arch of Titus? look quick and notice TWO of the identical pyramids. To me this suggests that something was cut from the entrance procession. because you never see the second pyramid enter and you see BOTH at EACH SIDE of the arch. Hummmmmmmmmmmm makes me wonder what else was cut from the procession. Was it not enough time?

PS: I'm writing this from memory so if there are a few misstatements I invite corrections. Just don't be so G.D. haughty in your comments. Oh, and don't bother pointing out grammar or spelling.",1369872000,38,2546,4.3452631578947365
3460102,5,B001AQO3SS,"I saw this movie during its initial release 50 years ago, and I am very pleased to have it so beautifully and lovingly restored.  The picture throughout is breathtaking, with an almost diamond-like brilliance.  The sound is stunning, every word clear and distinct and the music absorbing to hear.  Perhaps the movie is too long - or maybe not long enough.  Be sure and watch the ""extra"" about CLEOPATRA's ""Missing Footage.""  The performances are all good, and this latest viewing gave me additional respect for both Roddy McDowall and Martin Landau.  Rex Harrison is superb and Richard Burton is mesmerizing.  Miss Taylor is beautiful and convincing, and occasionally magnificent.

This was a truly spectacular movie, yet surprisingly intimate in its approach.  Too stately for some perhaps, but I relish every moment of this film and actually wish it were longer.  The extras are ALL of interest, particularly the two documentaries.  A magnificent Blu-Ray release, not to be missed.",1369872000,7,983,5.158227848101266
3460103,5,B001AQO3SS,"Cleopatra was most likely not as Beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor but, this portrayal is every bit a Queen as the last true Pharaoh of an independent Egypt.",1369785600,3,153,4.703703703703703
3460104,4,B001AQO3SS,"First let us clear up about the length.  According to International Movie Data Base (IMDB.com) this movie existed in three lengths. There was the original length - 5 hours and 20 minutes. That was the director's cut and only survived the premiere run. Then there was the theatrical release length - the version reviewed here. Apparently to enable more showings per day and possibly to supply drive-ins, there was a shorter version yet.

Roddy MacDowell made the comment in print that eliminating 82 minutes from the movie shortened his role a great deal.  I think the cuts focused the movie on the loves of Cleopatra and avoided the immensely complicated politics of the time.  For that reason, I've always found the end of the movie (the disgrace of Antony, leading up to his suicide) jumbled.

Second - no movie deserves HD more than this.  The movie was made before digital scenery was invented, so all of the immense Alexandria sets are really there.  The costuming is glorious, and the huge moments (such as the entry into Rome) do not disappoint.  (For connoisseurs, compare that with the closing scene of Star Wars - Phantom Menace.)  The bigger the screen the better. The choreography provided for slave dancers is still of the Cecil B. and not Agnes DeMille variety.

The script was being written as they filmed. That created the immense problem of portions of the script being bloated and unwieldy.
This becomes obvious when you realize that the acting styles of the stars don't jibe at all.  Elizabeth Taylor, when she isn't burdened with pseudo-monumental monologues, does a good job.  It is professional acting at its best, and if it doesn't move us, I believe the fault lies with the script itself.  Richard Burton - at the mature peak of his Shakespearean powers - gives a detailed account of Antony, but he allows himself to chew scenery at times. In contrast to Ms. Taylor, this contrast is awkward and becomes almost hammy.  Rex Harrison is restrained and brilliant.  More than one critic said that the movie became must less interesting after intermission (Caesar dies just before that PAUSE.)  Hume Cronyn, Roddy MacDowell, Martin Landau, and all the other actors give great performances that might have been even greater with the extra 80+ minutes in place.

Joseph Mankiewicz always wanted to restore the full length for video release.  VHS would not have worked. At the time it was ""pan and scan"" instead of letter-box, and you are lucky to have the actors even on screen.  In an argument between Cleopatra and Antony, the width of the image was so large that only noses and mouths appear.

Apparently the missing footage hasn't been found.  This review is based on the DVD, but I look forward to the Blu-Ray edition with great anticipation.  It may not be 382 minutes long, but it is still the last, truly great spectacular movie, made before it became cheaper and easier to accomplish the impossible. (Now if only we can find the full-length Cleopatra.)",1369699200,47,2978,4.8438735177865615
3460105,5,B001AQO3SS,"Like other reviewers here, I've purchased the Blu-ray which has been widely-available in the United Kingdom and Australia for many, many months.  I've no idea why it's taken so long to be released in the States, but for those who've been reluctant to import, it will be well worth the wait.

Quite simply this is the best CLEOPATRA has ever looked on home video - and that is no small feat considering that the title also received raves 10 years ago when it debuted on standard-definition DVD.  Restored from original 70mm Todd-AO elements, the High Definition picture brings out all the hidden detailing in sets and costumes, and Alex North's haunting score glistens in full DTS Master audio.

The one thing I criticise is the placement of the film's Entr'acte.  Just like the earlier DVD presentation, it has been placed at the end of Disc 1, when it should ideally be on the second disc before launching into the final portion of the film.  Whether or not this will be corrected on the American Blu-ray release I've yet to discover* - hopefully it has, but it's a very minor quibble on what is an otherwise comprehensive package.

The fascinating feature-length documentary ""Cleopatra: The Film That Changed Hollywood"", the vintage featurette ""The Fourth Star of Cleopatra"", and audio commentary with the brothers Mankiewicz, Martin Landau and Jack Brodsky are all ported over from the original DVD release.

New extras commissioned for this Blu-ray release include ""Cleopatra's Missing Footage"" (a brief look at the search, which continues to this day, for the elusive material culled from the shoot); ""Cleopatra Through the Ages: A Cultural History"" (just as the title implies), and ""The Cleopatra Papers: A Private Correspondence"" (an interactive gallery of letters and internal documents which chart the making of the movie).  ""Fox Legacy with Tom Rothman"" is a 30-minute look at the film's stormy production but simply re-covers what was told in greater depth in the ""Film That Changed Hollywood"" documentary.

Run - don't walk - to grab your copy of this Hollywood classic.  It's like discovering CLEOPATRA for the very first time, all over again.

Remember,they have to pass unnoticed or the guards will kill you and the snakes.
  Acknowledging more than 1 or 2 facts wouldn't take much,and neither would changing things to reflect the truth...She was in love with Ceasar,not Antony...Antony was the son of Ceasar and Cleopatra. Antony was jealous of his father,and wanted to take over his position as ruler of the Roman Empire. He went far enough to call Caesar a traitor,and in the end,kill him in Egypt.
  Cleopatra died by committing suicide with a poisoned meal,not snakes so she could be together with her lover,Caesar again,this time for all time. She didn't commit suicide to avoid execution. These are all facts I think romantically oriented plays and stories should acknowledge, because they are just that...romantic...and a lot more romantic than a couple of snakes.

This particular transfer yields what is quite simply the most spectacular Blu Ray I have ever seen. More than any other studio, Fox has lavished a great deal of time and money on preserving its widescreen films of the 50's, 60's and 70's. Nowhere is the success of that campaign more evident than on CLEOPATRA.

I would note that, as part of the restoration process on its widescreen epics, Fox has struck new 35mm and 70mm film prints. Here in New York, and elsewhere, these prints have been screened theatrically in retrospectives of various sorts. As wonderful as the new CLEOPATRA Blu Ray is, I can only hope that everybody with an interest in this movie will one day have a chance to see it in 70mm on a giant screen. If you have that opportunity, it is not to be missed. It's an experience you'll remember for a long, long time.",1362096000,101,1159,4.488151658767772
