2428956,4,B000BN6M0S,"If you enjoy creating moods for your reading experience, then the Ambient Water DVD can be enjoyable if you select a variety of scenes you enjoy and pair them up with the music or sound selections. To do this, you do have to go through some of the less enjoyable sections. I found the Aquarium scenes to be less relaxing than the ocean scenes. The fish are cute, but the bubbling was not as relaxing as I thought it would be. The clarity of the Aquariums is impressive and I thought they were beautifully filmed.

What I did enjoy once I made it through all the items available was the Mind Blender with drops of color seeping slowly into water and swirling around into a gorgeous fusion. The Ghostly images slipping across skies filled with wisps of smoky color was also quite artistically pleasing. The Classical Guitar playing while you are moving through galaxies was also relaxing.

The most enjoyable scenes on this DVD seem to be the soft velvety sapphire oceans with lemony peach skies. Ocean waves can be viewed along with music or surf sounds. The Rain on the Lake is pretty impressive if you love watching water. So, you can enjoy this DVD with only a few minutes of set up and I'd highly recommend taking the time to select your own music, water sounds and images before going on this journey. The preset selections are not as enjoyable as the customization elements.

If you love water themes, then this has a lot to enjoy and you can loop the customized selections for hours of enjoyment. I like watching this while reading because it has relaxing music and now and then I can look up and view a sunset or colors swirling in watery worlds.

2428957,1,B000BN6M0S,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD if you plan on recieving a beautiful HD image, because as amazing as you think it will appear, it simply won't look as incredible as it could...because it is still a regular DVD.  DVD's can only go up to 480p resolution which is NOT HD.  it could have been shot on HD, it could have been shot on beautiful 35mm even(better than HD digital) and it still will look the same as a regular dvd because DVD's cannot and will not ever be able to produce resultions of up to 720p 1080i-p (these are HD resolutions).  So for them to put ""Shot in HD"" all over the cover, and to make people think that they're going to recieve beatiful images is just crap.  You want a real fish tank image, go buy a real one, or get the HD-DVD aquarium dvd, that actually shows 720p-1080i image quality with appearently better footage anyway.  Just make sure you got a HD-DVD player before you do!",1167004800,13,890,4.273809523809524
2428958,4,B000BN6M0S,"This DVD isn't perfect, but it's pretty nice.  ""Shot in HD"" doesn't mean it PLAYS in HD, as this is not an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray disc.  It looks good on my 40"" LCD TV playing in an upscaling DVD player.

The scenes have a good variety of fish in attractive tanks.  Some buyers have complained that the fish are frighteningly large on some of these aquarium DVDs.  I did not find this to be the case with this DVD, but I ""only"" have a 40"" screen.  Perhaps the buyers who complained about this have frighteningly large TVs.

The sound is pleasant on the reef or saltwater settings.  The freshwater tank setting sounds a bit too much like my toddler blowing bubbles in a juicebox for my enjoyment.  I haven't even listened to the music setting.  If I want to hear music while I play this DVD, I'll play something I like.

This is not a feature film or an IMAX documentary.  It is ambience.  If I had the time or inclination to maintain a beautiful aquarium, I would want it to look just like one of the several scenes I liked on this disc.  If you stare at the screen and try to find some pixelation on a rapidly moving fish tail, you might find some.  Stop finding fault and enjoy the fish show in your hassle free aquarium!",1166140800,21,1218,4.25764192139738
2428959,1,B000BN6M0S,"I bought this along with another virtual aquarium hoping to show off my 37in hd flatpanel.  The only responses I got from showing it off was ""Did you pay money for that?""

It looks like someone mounted a camcorder next to a couple aquariums at the local pet store and tried to cash in. There is nothing HD about this dvd, in fact I've seen independent features with better video quality than this.",1155686400,35,397,4.424657534246576

On the other hand, too much noise distracts me, as well.  If i fire up the cable, I get nothing done.  If i turn the tube off, I feel too isolated & again, nothing.  This CD is the perfect productivity tool... for me, at any rate...  occupies the subconscious, quiets the voices & provides balance.

2428962,5,B000BN6M0S,"Nice digital aquarium user interface design with many aquarium choices and audio options. I tested this DVD on 2 Hi Def TV systems, and 2 Standard Def systems. All video display options demonstrated very good video quality. Not quite Hi-Def quality on my best Hi-Def Progressive Scan or Digital DVD players, but very, very good.

""Ambient Water - The Ultimate Video Aquarium"" can be viewed either in widescreen or NTSC format too! AND is a fantastic value priced at only $12.99!!",1144108800,14,479,4.91358024691358

There are rays and sharks, etc. I knew I wanted an aquarium DVD to show her, and this one is perfect for my purposes.  I find the ocean waves and rain scenes very relaxing for myself, as well.",1139356800,13,332,4.253968253968254
2428964,2,B000BN6M0S,"Notice how it only says ""shot in hd""? Anything put on film is shot in HD. I expected much more. The tank scenes are nowhere near HD.

2428976,4,B000BN6M0S,"Ambient Water Aquarium DVD presents beautiful aquarium scenes but I was somewhat disappointed by the audio accompaniment which sounded like a monotonous pumping of air through water.  The fish were beautiful, but I was expecting a greater variety.  The variety of fish is like what one would see in a small aquarium, not what one would expect to see when snorkeling on an ocean reef.",1420588800,,383,4.876923076923077

2428980,3,B000BN6M0S,"Not really sure what I expected, guess I just wanted a really fun variety of 'tanks' to choose from. 3 of these look almost identical, one is a bit boring looking and too green. In my opinion, the music isn't the best either... I've been playing it with just the saltwater tank sounds and my own music, which works fine. Also, when I view any of the tanks in any other mode except 'normal', the picture looks a bit distorted. Stretched out, is the best way to describe it. Overall though, it's a good novelty DVD. Buy it used.

2428981,5,B000BN6M0S,I purchased this as a relaxation video as I was going to be laid up for a few months due to surgery. I love fish but don't have the room for an aquarium. This video is absolutely awe inspiring! The scenes are as if you are right there in the midst of it. I play it constantly as it truly is very enjoyable to sit and watch. It is like having your own without all the fuss!,1359244800,,372,3.844155844155844

I have a 42 inch 1080i TV and this DVD looks really nice on it. I usually play my music instead of the supplied music and sounds that come with the DVD. For the price it's a great way to turn your TV into a pretty and relaxing screen. You can create your own playlists and play them in a loop which just keeps going.

I use it as a background on the tv when entertaining and enjoy having it on when I'm home so that it catches my eye whenever I go through the family room.  Looks real, as it should since it was taken of real fish.  I enjoy it and it certainly is less cost and less work than an aquarium.",1256515200,,364,3.9452054794520546

I have a 44 inch widescreen HD tv and it looks good on my television set. I find all of the scenes quite relaxing. I like the great variety of scenes to choose from. The only negative thing that I would say about this DVD is the sound options are disappointing. I do not really care for the music option and the sound effects options (gurgling and bubbling water) get annoying after awhile. I mute my television and put in a CD.",1230940800,,540,4.201923076923077

Since we are surrounded by computers we of course can't have a real aquarium near the consoles. I thought this was the next best thing. Everyone seems to enjoy it. The sound quality varies with each selection. On some you will have to keep the volume very high on the TV to hear the ""bubbles."" Since we keep the TV on mute that is not a major concern for us. The tanks that are the most popular are the ones that have the most active fish. We like the ""loop"" function that allows the same ""tank"" to play over and over. The ""play all"" feature is nice also.",1206576000,2,643,4.235772357723577

But now I am thinking I want a similar type video in Blu ray. I was dissapointed in the underwater stingray segment, only bcuz the water seemed murky and the lens of the camera was also dirty. I know this cuz I snorkel every year at my home on a small tropical island part of the Philippines, the water there is much clearer and the fish and coral are way more abundant and colorful. Also the segment wer the ocean waves wer crashing on the rocks seemed to be speeded up, not natural looking.

My guess it is a lot of old people who do not how to use their TV right. I would give this 4.5 stars really. it misses out in that some shots are a bit far away but you can at find at least one or two nice scenes.,1198540800,,546,3.4471544715447155

2429016,1,B000BN6M0S,"ATTENTION: ""Shot in HD"" apparently translates to ""Horrible Video Quality"". After buying what I expected to be an HD dvd I played it in my brand new SONY 1080i HD TV. The quality on most of the aquariums is horrendous. The picture is grainy, and it seems that either the fish or the background is always out of focus. The dvd seems to be set up to advertise their other products and the main menu looks like it was designed in a preschool drawing class. The sound effects were likely made by people blowing bubbles in their milk. I would strongly reccomend that anyone considering this DVD take their money elsewhere.",1190160000,5,616,4.558558558558558
