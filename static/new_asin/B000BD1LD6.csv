2414077,4,B000BD1LD6,"For anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they ""gave away"".....for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way...have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better...or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when ""feeling"" was what life was all about, this movie should be right up your alley.

It is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times.......and still like it!",1171497600,2,531,4.474226804123711
2414078,4,B000BD1LD6,"I must say I enjoyed this movie very much.  It is a retrospective of Eve's

choices.  Sometimes an individual looks back on a situation wishing that they could reexamine a decision.  This movie is a fine example that Christmas is a magical time.  That a person can get what they wish for.

Eve looks for happiness in New York, but she has to go home to Oregon and the road lest traveled.  She finds happiness with Scott by making her Christmas wish.

2414079,5,B000BD1LD6,"very heartwarming to see someone get a second chance from a terrible mistake she made the first time. she almost makes the same mistake, but love conquers all.",1169424000,2,159,4.714285714285714
2414080,4,B000BD1LD6,"I was afraid this movie was going to be a career versus family story.  It isn't.  It's a career-only versus career-with-family story.  It seems to be speaking to those who feel that the decision to get married and have a family means giving up their dreams, setting low goals and having low expectations.  This movie shows that you don't have to do it that way.  You can get married, have a family and still strive to make something of your life.  It does not show that it may (or may not) be harder that way, but the point is made.

If you want a career versus family movie, the best is ""Me, Myself, I"" (NO, not ""Me, Myself and Irene"").  This is an intelligent Australian movie that shows that both choices come with a price, both have their advantages and disadvantages.  The movie stars Rachel Griffiths and is powerful, if sobering.

Eve's Christmas is not really a Christmas movie, but a story set at Christmas time, which is appropriate since thoughts of family and old friends tend to occur at this time of the year.

To take on our local ""experts"": the script is no ""weaker"" than most other movie scripts, and the acting is competent.  The first half of the movie could have been more eventful but is not slow.  The lead actress could have been better cast, but this one does not hurt the movie.

Bottom line: an enjoyable feel-good movie, quite realistic (unless you've never seen a happy family and don't believe they exist).",1135296000,32,1435,4.533073929961089
2414081,1,B000BD1LD6,"I'm a sucker for anything Christmas. I generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year, but come Christmas-time, I lap up these sappy movies. But even I couldn't stomach this one. The screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time I was watching it I wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a Christmas movie could be written and shot in 3 days that suckers like me would buy. What a waste of money & time!",1134604800,21,446,4.137931034482759
2414082,4,B000BD1LD6,"""Eve's Christmas"" is a TV movie with a very weak script, that is valiantly held together by a good cast, and a nice ""second chance in life"" plot. Eve is a top New York ad agency gal, making lots of money and a mess out of her life. She is having an affair with her licentious married boss, and left alone on Christmas Eve, has far too much to drink (the libations run like a river in this film). She reflects over the last few years of her empty existence, which have been cut off from her family, and very lonely. A guardian angel, disguised as a panhandler, tells her to wish upon a star, and she is granted a week to go back in time and make different choices.

Elisa Donovan plays Eve, and is fine in the role, but it's a difficult part to be convincing in, as she is the sophisticated New Yorker, but at the same time the girl back home, about to get married, working in a coffee shop. Cheryl Ladd shines as her mother, and also excellent are Winston Reckert as her father, Erin Karpluck as her friend Mandy, and Peter Williams as the guardian angel, Brother James. Best of all is Sebastian Spence as Scott, the man she almost married. His charismatic smile and good looks, as well as his talent, make me wonder why he is not more well known as an actor, and not the current heart-throb on the magazine covers.

Directed by Timothy Bond, a veteran of many TV films, ""Eve's Christmas"" is a charming romantic fantasy despite its many flaws (the bridal shop scenes make no sense at all, and are simply horrible), and if one doesn't have high expectations, this unpretentious little film is quite entertaining. The total running time is 96 minutes, and the DVD extras include a ""Behind the Scenes Featurette.""",1132531200,65,1710,4.425396825396826

2414097,5,B000BD1LD6,"A lighthearted, imaginative movie with an enjoyable cast.  Another holiday movie we watch every year. Eve went back in time with the help of an angel? to relive a turning point in her life.  Will she make different choices this time?  Tune in to find out.",1388880000,,255,4.5
2414098,4,B000BD1LD6,"It's 2004 and Eve Simon (Eliza Donovan) faces another lonely holiday in New York. Eight years on the grind at her marketing firm, Eve's kept her eyes on the prize, she's scaled that corporate ladder. She's nearly at the top rung. But, tonight, she's at a low ebb. It's not been a good day. Her mind wanders back to that long ago moment when she chose career over love. Estranged from her family, pining for a lost romance, she makes a whimsical wish upon a star. Sometimes, when you do such things during Christmas, you get more than you bargained for.

Eve Simon awakens in 1996 in her sleepy hometown of Eastborough, Oregon, mere days away from her Christmas day wedding. Naturally, Eve is perplexed and halfway suspects that she's being punked, but she rolls with it. Let's sit back and watch Eve relive those days when she'd just finished grad school and was managing a coffee shop (today, she loathes coffee).

We learn all over again that hindsight is 20/20. In her second chance Eve indulges in a bit of matchmaking, spruces up her then fianc's flagging book store, hangs out with Mandy (Erin Karpluk), the one constant friend in her life, and I think I just skipped over Eve's love interest, my bad. Scott Gustafson (Sebastian Spence), Eve's intended, has got that stout Viking name, so it's too bad that he doesn't register much on my radar, although he seems like a sweet guy. In 1996, he spends most of the time being non-plussed at how Eve's been acting so strange of late.

Eve's Christmas is a slice of small town life and refutes that old saw about the grass being greener on the other side. In 2004, on that lonely Christmas eve, Eve reflects that the grass on that old side was really quite verdant and- never mind, I'm wasting imaginary ink stretching this metaphor. What we have in this movie is Eve's re-experiencing those everyday moments that, for her, add up to what defines home and contentment and, ultimately, herself as the person she wants to be. Watching this movie is like putting on an old pair of pajamas, nothing exciting, but there's a gratifying comfort level. Cheryl Ladd (my second favorite Angel) has a supporting part as Eve's understanding mom, and she's as lovely as ever. In the annals of altered reality/time travel romantic films, it plays very much in the pocket. It's not as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peggy-Sue-Got-Married/dp/B00C6F61HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peggy Sue Got Married</a>&nbsp;(1986) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Man/dp/B005F2JRUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Man</a>&nbsp;(2000). It's certainly not as sweepingly romantic as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somewhere-in-Time-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00004W46I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)</a>, but, hey, this is a made-for-television heart-warmer so the production values tend towards the more modest. I like it just as much as I did other television pictures:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Family-Thanksgiving/dp/B005CFC0L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Family Thanksgiving</a>&nbsp;(2010) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Comfort-and-Joy/dp/B0002V7U00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Comfort and Joy</a>&nbsp;(2003). Plus, Winky's, that watering hole/diner/karaoke bar in Eastborough, looks like a fun place to hang. 3.5 out of 5 stars for Eve's Christmas.

Note that my favorite acting in this film is done by the lively Erin Karpluk as Eve's best friend in both past and present. I only wish there was an ""N"" in that surname.

If you were scratching your head about the review title, the traffic light as a wish fulfillment device is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-You-Say-I-Do/dp/B0036K9CIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before You Say I Do</a>, a terrific TV film in this genre and one I should've mentioned before.

Eve has the opportunity to relive the time during which she made this fateful choice.  It may not be the strongest script nor the best acting I've seen, but it is a heartwarming, nostalgic movie.

A million people would love to have a chance to go back in time at some point in their life and make thing's different just like Eve did. The purpose of the story is that money isn't everything and that family is so very important. Eve had a terrific Pennhouse in NY City, and she was a top executive for her company making 150,000 plus a year, however it all went for nothing because she was single with the exception of sleeping with her boss who was seperated with kids and only hired pretty intern girls. Eve was overworked and turned to drinking because her only friend was her secretary and she had no family at all. She realized this was not the life she wanted and that she wanted to go back 8 years prior and complete a Christmas day wedding she cancelled by accepting the job offer in NY.

I was never a big Elisa Donavan fan prior to this but after this movie, I actually grew to like her very much.  There are some funny things in the movie that  I chuckle at----like the fact that this is set 10 years ago (10 years ago from point of filming which was 2004, so 1994)  and supposedly Eve can create a working website overnight and sell things over the internet the next morning, linking the store's inventory up, etc.  Humm......I don't think it was quite that easy in 1994 but I'm no IT expert.
