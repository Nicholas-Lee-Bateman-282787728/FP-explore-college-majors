8135829,5,B000H1RFUU,This movie is part of our Native American collection at our tribal library.  It is a replacement and so very happy to find it at a resonable cost.,1342742400,,146,4.214285714285714
8135830,1,B000H1RFUU,"Say what you will about whatever you consider the worst film ever made...mutiply it by about 7 and you come pretty close to this garbage. I actually bought this (used at a video store) because it was the last film appearance by James Doohan (Star Trek's Scotty). Not only was it sad to see him so far gone but for it to be in this swill is just gut-wrenching.
I won't even attempt to actually review this...just stay very far away. Even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys wouldn't touch this one.",1184889600,8,499,4.434782608695652
8135831,1,B000H1RFUU,I regret I rented it. I will never rent these B-movies again. There's no special effects. The acting is just like the one performed by high school students. The beast? It looks obviously like a man wearing a mask. What a waste of time and money.,1172966400,10,245,4.3478260869565215
8135832,1,B000H1RFUU,Worst movie ever the creture on the front cover is not even in the movie you do not see the monster which is a beast until the last 15 minutes...Do not waste your money on this home made movie  Please take my word for it it is that Bad...............The majority of the movie is talking........,1159920000,14,294,4.345454545454546
