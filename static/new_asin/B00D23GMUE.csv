8588427,4,B00D23GMUE,"This film was supposed to be released in 1972, and I even saw a trailer preview for it at a local Seattle drive-in, saying ""Coming next week.""  Unfortunately, the film never did open in Seattle.  Perhaps 20th-Century Fox got cold feet?  After all, Nixon was still in the white house.

The film itself is a generally excellent drama about Viet Nam veterans returning home from the war.  They're not treated like heroes at all, leading to very bitter emotions.  As good as most of the film is, the climax seems more like a standard action flick battle than a more socially-conscious drama.  The irony is that the soldier boys are battling other Americans once they've returned home.

In terms of video quality, this release probably rates a three-star rating.  The image is full-frame and a bit hazy.  I never saw the film theatrically, due to its spotty distribution, so I can't say what the original cinematography looked like.  The four-star rating is because the film is finally available in the US at all, having never been released in American home video formats before.  I've never seen it appear on any cable channel either, so it is good to finally be able to catch up to this rarely screened drama.",1370044800,11,1206,4.717703349282297
