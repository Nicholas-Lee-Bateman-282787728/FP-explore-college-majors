If you aren't a fan of Grant Hill before watching this video you just might become one after. This video catalogs Grant's meteoric rise in the NBA, to his days as a college player at Duke, to behind the scenes with his family and friends and exposes him as great guy and class act. Even though injuries plagued his career and derailed his hall of fame potential, there is no evidence that he is any less of a person today than what the video declared he is. A nice guy, a great basketball player with the passion of a warrior. There are some pretty nice highlights of Grant, although I wish there had been more of him on this video, they are still pretty good and the highlights are my favorite part of watching the video.

For me the video was a good investment. I'm very glad to have added it to my collection.",1303862400,,946,4.226519337016574
