4702748,3,B005HPYLU8,"Maybe it's just me, but I prefer the style of bike training dvd where you see the open road out in front of you, like you're actually riding.  I am new to spinning so I bought this one to use, but after a few minutes of viewing it, it was apparent to me that it wasn't my thing.  Also, I am just a little put off by her cleaveage showing.  I am a woman and all, but it's just kind of annoying and distracting.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me again.  She seems like a very experienced and knowledgable instructor, but it's just not for me.

I'll probably be selling this dvd on Ebay soon.",1359158400,6,590,4.0344827586206895
4702749,5,B005HPYLU8,This is the best video I've gotten from Mindy.  Some of her others vidoes can be too talky.  This one has trhe right balance and the tabata workout is tough.,1358380800,10,157,4.2
4702750,3,B005HPYLU8,I like that you can do one workout for beginners then advanced to the second and third workout.  It will get you there!,1358208000,,119,4.173913043478261
4702751,4,B005HPYLU8,"This is an excellent workout. I was worried because I'm a beginner at spinning, and didn't Know how I was going to deal with it. Let me tell you that at first I thought that it was too hard for me, but the option o doing a 20 minutes workout routine is perfect, now I'm doing two 20 minutes workouts and going to do all three one after the other. That's my goal. I am 53 years old and i have to be very careful with my knees and this workout is gentle and effective. and it works!!! I feel like I am 30  again. I love how am already looking.",1351209600,77,541,3.873873873873874
4702752,2,B005HPYLU8,"The idea of a short spin video is great but this video has a lot to be desired. I do agree that some of the workouts are somewhat intense, but this is overshadowed by Mindy's constant chatter. I have been going to spin classes regularly for over 5 years and whenever i've encountered spin instructors who talk this much.... they're never employed for long periods of time at the gym.  Overall if you want a good 20 min workout, this is a good buy, but make sure your ipod is charged with good music and make sure you mute this spin video.",1346630400,8,538,4.2745098039215685
4702753,5,B005HPYLU8,"The title fits this workout perfectly.  You can do one 20 minute workout or do all three for a 60 minute workout.  Since I usually  do several different workouts to mix things up, the 20 minute one works for me.  I thought Mindy's talking would bother me but I'm working so hard that I don't even pay attention.  I get a good workout.  Definitely a good purchase for me!",1333152000,3,370,4.2898550724637685
4702754,5,B005HPYLU8,"This is the second Mindy Mylrea spin DVD I have purchased (Tricycle being the first).  Both DVDs are good. I really like the Short & Sweet and I feel like I get a good workout using any of the three options she gives. My favorite is the tabata but all three are good workouts as long as you push yourself to put in the effort it requires to do high intensity shorter workouts. I don't find the music on any workout DVD all that great so I don't really put much judgement into that aspect. However, the music to Short and Sweet workouts is not bad. The music volume is louder during high intensity sections and then quieter during recovery times at which point Mindy talks a bit more.  I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1329436800,3,723,4.348148148148148
4702755,4,B005HPYLU8,"I am a huge Mindy Mylrea fan so I was excited to use my Christmas gift card on this item. I read somewhere before preordering that each segment was only about 20 minutes long but I figured if it was only 20 minutes it had to be a good workout. Well, I am happy to say that is true but I'm old-school and still feel like I need at least 30 minutes of exercise to feel good by the time I'm done.  The great thing about this and her other videos is I can always tailor them to my time-frame.  For Tabata (completely new and very cool to me), I just added an extra Tabata to my workout and came very close to the half an hour with my 4-5 minute warm-up.  For the others, I found that I can select the ""play all"" option and skip to the chapter where the exercise starts, then rewind for my warm-up and keep going after the selected workout if I still have energy.  I am finding it to be very versatile and what I LOVE about Mindy's videos is just when I thought I figured out Spinning, she comes up with new ways to wear me out.  I have only done Spin at home so my brain can be a bit limited on the possibilities so I thoroughly enjoy these workout videos. I gave it a 4 out of 5 only because I wish they were at least 25 minutes but you will definitely get your sweat on if you aren't faking it!  Ready for more videos, Mindy!",1326931200,16,1323,3.954887218045113

4702767,4,B005HPYLU8,"Excellent 20 minute workout.  You can choose which routine to do that day.  Mindy is a little ""dry"" but If you can get put that the workout is worth it",1474416000,,151,4.0
4702768,5,B005HPYLU8,"Mindy Mylrea does an outstanding job in this spinning video.  I'm new to spinning, and didn't
want to spend lots of time on my BodyCraft SPR every day.  So this video is exactly what I
was looking for.  The video offers three workout routines, each 20 minutes long:  Tabata, Threshold Ladder,
and Hill Repeats.  There is a pace you want to follow for each workout, but you can make it as hard or
as easy as you want.  And Mindy looks real good leading us in this video.  She's enthusiastic about the
subject matter and in great shape.  I recommend this video to anyone who wants a great workout
in a short amount of time.

Update (11/04/2016):  After using this spinning video a couple of months now, I still love it.  It has one huge,
glaring weakness, however-THE MUSIC.  Oftentimes, it drowns out what Mindy is saying, and after
awhile, this becomes very very frustrating.  If it weren't for the horrendously obnoxious music, this
video would be perfect for my needs.",1470960000,,970,4.60233918128655

I tend to do the Tabata one more than the others.  It really is a fabulous workout.  I use a heart rate monitor that calculates calories burned and while I know you can't depend on those being accurate, they are accurate ""relatively"" and relative to other exercises, it shows that I burn as much or usually more calories doing this than just about anything else I do...",1440979200,4,512,4.3578947368421055

The combinations/permutations you can create of the 3 base workouts means you won't get bored.  I used to love spinning, and then I moved to another state.  The instructors were not challenging, and the music was way to loud.  Now I can enjoy spinning again when I want, and play music if I want at a volume that won't blast out my ears.

While the usual provisos regarding consulting your doctors before engaging in any fitness program are in play, what I love about the three programs here are that they, especially the first two, offer the real benefits and challenges that can result with HIIT training.  Of course, it is up to the individual as to whether they do traditional interval training with the contents of the DVD or whether they push themselves to the range of true high intensity.  I also understand that this might not be the best fit for all.

4702830,5,B005HPYLU8,"I have many DVD's for my spin bike and this is truly one of my favorites.  It is challenging but
at the same time not impossible for the beginner to more advanced.",1376870400,20,163,4.09375
4702831,5,B005HPYLU8,"Each 20 min workout on this video truly gets my heart pumping, and give just enough time for it to settle down.  This is a fantastic interval workout.  It is the most efficient spin DVD I've used (or read about). I don't have much time (who does?), so efficiency is key.  MINDY, PLEASE CREATE A ""SHORT & SWEET 2""!!!  I'd buy it in a second.",1372636800,2,340,4.184615384615385
4702832,4,B005HPYLU8,"I have only used this DVD a few times, It is a tough workout, but short as promised, I haven't explored all of it yet",1371600000,,117,3.72
4702833,5,B005HPYLU8,"I love this dvd because it doesn't mess around.  After a five minute warm-up (same for each workout), you jump right into the intensity.  One feature that I really like is that there is an onscreen graphic showing how much time remains in each interval; this encourages me to push harder because I know when I can ease off.  I also have Mindy's Tricycle dvd which lacks this info, and for me, it really makes a difference.",1369612800,4,422,4.454545454545454
4702834,4,B005HPYLU8,"I strained my knee playing tennis and had to take a break from the Insanity, Jillian, running, and any of the other joint intense workouts I was doing regularly.  I bought a stationary bike and this DVD.  I have never been to a spin class so I was not sure what to expect.  I like this DVD a lot.  The 30 minute sessions are the perfect length, allowing time for me to do core or other body parts after the cardio.  I like the Tabata workout the best.  It is very intense but is segmented into 20 seconds of hard pedaling then 10 seconds of rest.  The hill workout is my least favorite.  The hills are several minutes and it is too easy to let your mind wander and thus let your intensity drop off.  I get bored pretty easily and any workout that requires me to stay focused to keep the intensity up can be a challenge.  The middle workout is structured in 1 minute bouts, so I like it better than the hills.  It is not quite as intense as the Tabata series so it is a nice, lighter option.  I am looking for more workouts for the bike that are like this short and sweet group.",1368144000,2,1077,4.100478468899522
4702835,5,B005HPYLU8,This is a great at home workout for beginners.  I just got a spin bike and this is the first dvd I purchased.  I will be purchasing more in the future but this is great for a beginners and broken down into 20 minute workouts which is also great if you do not have a lot of time.,1360195200,16,278,3.7758620689655173

8473439,4,B005HPYLU8,Decent - she's pretty clear on what she expects from you at all times. The screen feedback on where your are in the whole workout could be better.

8473441,5,B005HPYLU8,"I was hesitant about buying a cycling DVD without being able to preview first.. so I read all the reviews and went for it....glad I did!  This is the perfect in home cycling DVD..  20min sessions are just want I needed..  Mindy's instruction is simple and music is ok and not overbearing.  I taught cycling for several years and wanted to get back into it without joining a club.. (not interested in cycling outside) so I invested in a fantastic indoor cycle and was looking for a good workout..  I love this DVD.  Simple, straightforward instruction, hear rate gets elevated, not a lot of talking, and sessions are short and sweet and sweaty!  I recommend it!",1512518400,2,660,4.637931034482759
