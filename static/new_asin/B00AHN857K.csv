8551714,5,B00AHN857K,AWESOME. Rick gives great instruction. The quality is top notch. This will be watched many times over.,1440547200,,102,5.0588235294117645
8551715,5,B00AHN857K,"This is part one of a two part video series on animatronics by Rick Lazzarini. It is very well done. Rick speaks plain English and in  terms that are easy to understand. You almost get the feeling you are apprenticing in Rick's shop. I really enjoyed this video so much, I bought the 2nd one as well!",1401062400,,300,4.2631578947368425
8551716,5,B00AHN857K,We live in a time where you can learn anything. What a joy to have these DVDs and watch and learn at your own page from the masters. Thanks Stan Winston and Henson group.,1400284800,,170,4.029411764705882
8551717,5,B00AHN857K,"If you only buy two DVDs about making animatronic pumas come to life this year, make the Stan Winston School of Character Arts ""Animatronic Character Creation: Organic Mechanics, Parts One and Two"" featuring Special Creature Effects Wizard Rick Lazzarini be the purchase you make. You will learn the secrets of Hollywood Insiders in a clear, concise, and humorous way. I enjoyed it and it shows you how to do things with a Dremel tool that may in fact be morally questionable. Wear eye protection while performing any of the processes on these videos. In fact, if you wear a baseball cap down real low you will hardly ever notice how bald the guy is getting. Maybe he should wear one, too.",1368489600,2,689,4.702479338842975
8551718,4,B00AHN857K,"Expensive but detailed.

They go to great detail to show their secrets in a practical way.
I would like automata tapes to come out some day.",1365379200,,140,4.384615384615385
