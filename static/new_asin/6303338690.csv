625629,1,6303338690,This dvd does not play all the way through. It stops at a certain chapter and will not play all the way through. I ordered this for myself and my sister. The dvd seems like a bootleg. I went into the account to see who I bought it from and I was shocked to see it was Amazon.com. Im not sure how this is legal but Amazon should know this dvd is very suspicious. The back of the dvd look like rewritable DVDs and both are copied differently.,1518307200,,440,4.011363636363637

The characters in this is UNFORGETTABLE! From Icebox to Junior, this one had it all! I still watch it regularly and have since introduced it to my 7 year old son who now watches it frequently! We always quote lines from it and get a kick out of Ed O'Neill's character. He's so cocky yet lovable at the same time. With greats like Oneill, Rick Moranis, a young Devan Sawa, and more this movie just has it all. Fun for the whole famly!",1483660800,3,584,4.131578947368421

625962,4,6303338690,"My 7 year old enjoyed this movie.  There were times when I thought that it was a little rough and mature for a kids movie, but I would recommend for any kid 9+ without question; 6-9 I recommend if the child is mature and at parents discretion.  I must disclose that I am a little more conservative when it comes to my kids, though.  As an example, there is one seen where a boy and girl in the show spend a few minutes discussing the different types of kissing, followed by awkward moments of the girl wanting to kiss the boy.  I would have liked more in the story line about team work and coming together as a team - I had to narrate that part in for my son.",1467244800,2,659,4.046153846153846

634267,5,6303338690,"I love this movie, it reminds me of my son and other less-athletic kids who were passed over for 7-9 yrs old basketball tryouts in a city wide parks and recreation league in a local city in the suburbs of Los Angeles in the early 90's .  The disappointment in my son and other boy's and girl's faces when rejected; without even given a chance while the 'preferred' kids were all split into teams, angered me so much that I had to speak up and argue about what took place. I made an instant decision to ask for special permission (since I was not a park coach employee), to take them all under my wing and create another team. I took in 12 kids or so;some who didn't even know how to dribble, let alone play basketball and taught them the basics and teamwork and discipline.  I played every kid in every game and watched them grow confidence and skills and become a team! we played all teams and beat everyone of them and became league champions! No, I did not show favoritism to my son; but he made a winning game basket in the playoffs!
mushy, feel good movie with plenty of lessons for younger kids and a holywood ending!",1444694400,,1123,4.317535545023697

635277,5,6303338690,"I totally loved this movie.
It is funny and sweet and full of hope and emotion.
You do not need to understand sports to enjoy this movie.

At the beginning of the movie, the two little boys who played the younger versions of Ed O'Neill and Rick Moranis were amazing.
The way that they talked and acted were exactly like them.

One very minor thing annoyed me.
This is a comedy, and it should not be taken seriously, but I need to mention it anyway.
The very overprotective mother said that she spent nine months in bed trying to have a healthy baby.
And still, her baby was born at less than two pounds.
This really annoyed me because it is impossible to have such a tiny baby with a full term pregnancy.

Too many people are reviewing this movie based on its price, rather than the movie.",1443484800,,789,4.3175675675675675

Highly unbelievable events occur regularly(a la every Disney movie of the era), and it seems to capitalize on the Mighty Duck juvenile sport vibe of the time period, both of which, in my opinion, are good things that make the movie flow well.

636710,4,6303338690,"There is a lot to like about this movie.  The film does not take itself very seriously and it works very well.  You are able to look past some of the cheese factor because the film has a lot of heart.  The previews and commercials for the film did not really do it justice, that is why I passed on watching it when it first came out.  But after seeing the film later on I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the movie.

I bet the cast had a blast making this film.  A lot of the characters are clichs and have been used before similar to the original Bad News Bears etc.  The brains with little or no athletic abilities trying to beat the jocks who have probably been brought up playing club sports for years. I liked the moral philosophy that Rick Moranis tells his kids it just takes ""one time"".

I really enjoyed the end of the film as well how they ended it on such a positive note without being sappy.  When I originally saw the preview for this movie I thought it would suck.  How many times do you need to see the underdog pull through in the big game.  So many sports movies repeat the same ideals but this is one decent movie.

A lot of us grew up with brothers or sisters like the Ed O'Neil character that could do no wrong academically or physically Marsha Marsha Marsha comes to mind.  This movie should be priced at around $5 to $10 nothing more.  A good family film.",1428019200,4,1381,4.201520912547529

One of the better family comedy's about sports.
A sad sack team of misfit kids, who would never get picked for anything,  get a chance to play competitive peewee football in a small town, coached by Moranis, a hopeless misfit himself.
This movie is destined to be a classic and kids will certainly love it, along with adults. It has a rare charm all it's own, with lessons on life, team spirit, friendship, and yes,  a girl can play football, too.
A sweetly humorous movie in which childhood innocence shines through for all to see and from an underdog's vantage point, cowering behind the bleachers.
Predictable but who would want it any other way?

637221,5,6303338690,"I really liked this film.  It's not a groundbreaking movie in any way, though.  It's about a bunch of underdog kids who aren't interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds.  Throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented (and unlikeable) team.  It's pretty much the same thing we've seen in the Mighty Ducks except now it's about football.

It's just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you're small and think you don't have any talent, you actually DO have the talent to play football, hockey, basketball, whatever.  One of the characters is a girl who doesn't know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls.

Rick Moranis once again plays that shy, quiet character he does so well in other films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids.  It's hard to believe he's now a country singer (no, I'm not kidding).  Ed O'Neil doesn't quite play the jerk character you'd expect from the Married with Children show.  He's not really a nice guy either, though.

I find it interesting that the team names are the Giants (the good guys) vs. the Cowboys (the bad guys) because the Monday Night Football game this week were those two teams facing each other (with the Giants winning).",1161734400,2,1349,4.579166666666667
637222,3,6303338690,"When Ed O'Neill was cast into the role as Al Bundy in the late 1980s comedy, ""Married with Children"", it quickly would become a role synonymous with O'Neill himself.  At the same time it catapulted O'Neill into a major star.  It seemed natural that O'Neill would soon start to do feature films.  However, for the most part O'Neill's feature film resume has never lived up to his role as Al Bundy.  In 1994, while still on ""Married with Children"", O'Neill would team up with Rick Moranis to star in a comedy called ""Little Giants"".  While I'd hardly call ""Little Giants"" a groundbreaking or award-winning movie, it still was a pretty good film.  Much of what made this movie very good has to be credited to the talents of O'Neill himself.

For the most part, ""Little Giants"" follows a familiar style of story.  O'Neill plays Kevin O'Shea.  Kevin is a local hometown former All-American football hero.  Kevin is now retired from Football and owns a successful car dealership in his hometown of Urbania.  He lives in an nice house with his wife and two daughters.  Also living in Urbania is Kevin's brother Danny O'Shea (played by Rick Moranis).  Danny's life hasn't been quite as successful.  Danny's wife had abandoned him and his daughter Becky many years ago - living Danny in the role as single parent.  Danny runs a service station in Urbania, but doesn't nearly live the lifestyle of Kevin.  When Kevin is asked to coach a peewee football team to represent Urbania, he takes the role very competitively as he has taken Football all of his life.  When Danny sees Kevin having tryouts for the Football team, he becomes very upset with the way Kevin is handling things.  Kevin only picks the best players to play.  While Danny's daughter Becky deserves to play, Kevin basically leaves her off the team because he is a girl  Not only does Danny feel Becky deserves to play, but he feels that all kids deserve a chance to play on Urbania's peewee football team - no matter how good they are.  This leads Danny to form his own football team - with the ""castoffs and misfits"" who didn't make Kevin's team.  Because the peewee football league will only allow one team to represent Urbania, Kevin and Danny have their teams square off on the field to decide who will represent Urbania.  The film then focuses on Danny's attempts to build and train a rag-tagged Football team up against his brother's well-oiled machine.

There are a couple of interesting subplots going on in this film.  The first one involves Becky - Danny's daughter.  We see Becky struggle with walking a fine-line between being a tom-boy and a teenage girl.  Since Becky is a main part of Danny's team, this has an integral role in the film.  The other involves Danny and Kevin's attempt to recruit a blue chip prospect named ""Spike"" - a new boy in town, with a ""little league father"".

The movie also uses the NFL connection in a couple of ways.  The first is the team names.  Kevin's team adopts the helmets and uniforms of the Dallas Cowboys while Danny's team will adopt the helmets of the New York Giants.  Being a New York Giants fan, it made me even root more for the underdog ""Little"" New York Giants against the hated Dallas Cowboys (On the other hand, Cowboy fans may not feel the same way).  The other involves some cameos of some famous NFL stars.  These NFL stars happen to be passing through Urbania and lend a hand to Danny as he is training the Little Giants for the big game.  These players include Tim Brown, Steve Emtman, Bruce Smith, Emmitt Smith, and of course John Madden - all of whom are playing themselves.  As he does in the broadcast booth, Madden will also entertain on the big screen.

In this movie, Rick Moranis is once again cast into the wimpy, unsuccessful character.  We see this happen in a movie he does later on with Tom Arnold called ""Big Bully"".  This is a style of character that has almost become synonymous with Moranis himself.  While Moranis' character of Danny is the hero - he becomes a difficult character to root for.  It's O'Neill's character of Kevin that dominates.  This is not because Kevin is ""stronger"" than Danny - it is because that Ed O'Neill is a superior actor to Rick Moranis.  The only interesting thing that happens to the character of Danny O'Shea is how the idea of coaching up against his brother begins to consume him - and impact his relationship with daughter Becky.

The idea of an underdog team going up against the established team is something we've seen time and time again.  The other concept of the weaker brother going up against the stronger brother is also something that has been seen many times.  While ""Little Giants"" will entertain audiences throughout the movie, the familiar concepts of underdog and brother against brother are completely predictable.  On top of that, the ending will also be completely predictable - including how most of the big game between the Giants and Cowboys go.  On a side note, the kids playing the members of the Little Giants team are very fun to watch.

Still despite the predictability, I still found this a pretty decent movie.  Even with the movie being very predictable, the nice thing is that the underdog Giants will become a very root-able team against the Cowboys.  And of course, Ed O'Neill will shine big time in this movie.  This is a good movie for young and old to watch and one that I would recommend.",1154822400,3,5397,4.64519535374868

Kind of like Mighty Ducks, but in my opinion, a lot better with greatly funnier jokes. The only thing keeping me from giving this a full five stars, and a lot of you will think it's a stupid reason....as do I, but on the original VHS version, there was a Michigan J. Frog cartoon short before the movie. This is absent on the dvd version. That said, the dvd is a lot better for many other reasons. There are really cool bios about the people who helped invent football, a theatrical trailer for the movie, a really awesome special introduction by Shawna Waldron, who played Becky The Icebox in the movie (man, she got really hot) and a really fun commentary by the director, one of the writers, and Shawna Waldron. If you have the chance, you should get this dvd. You can't beat such a low price for such a great movie.",1126310400,7,996,4.219895287958115
637225,3,6303338690,"The 1990's gave us a number of kids movies with the same theme...a Team of no-talent rejects comes together and eventually finds a way to win the championship/big game.  We saw the same plot used in each Mighty Duck picture, Big Green, Ladybugs, and now little Giants.  It's all basically a re-hash of 1970's hit The Bad News Bears.  Only difference is that the Bears ultimately lost their big game but today we need happy endings.

In this version, Rick Moranis is Danny O' Shea a nerdy guy and brother to Kevin O'Shea (ed O'Neil) who was the town's star athlete 20 years earlier.  kevin now coaches the towns little league football team and Danny's Dauther is cut from the team, Danny outs together his own team of misfits to compete in a winner take all battle.

All the usual characters are here...the Tomboy who is Danny's Daughter Becky, the fat kid, the nerdy kid, the verious ethnic kids, and the good kid who doesn't want to play with the other team, are all well-represented.

Danny doesn't know the first thing about football and struggles early until a bus breaks down in town that just happens to be carrying John Madden along with NFL stars Bruce Smith, Emmitt Smith, and Tim Brown.  The stars pass along their wisdom to help Danny out.

Of course, things still don't go well and the team is losing badly, but when Becky drops her cheerleader pompoms and joins the team at halftime, things turn around for the Little Giants.

It's all sappy and formulatic...you've seen it before but its not a horrible movie.  There's a few laughs and some bathroom humor and its all in good fun.  B for effort and C for execution.",1103241600,10,1629,4.5793103448275865
637226,5,6303338690,"Little Giants is just good clean fun!  This movie manages to combine football and coming of age for adults and kids.

The O'Shea brothers are complete opposites.  Danny is an average Joe with little history or fame.  His brother is the football-famous Kevin O'Shea and his new domain is coach of the town's number-one-ranked pee-wee football team.

When Danny fields his own football team to challenge Kevin's team, the results are side-splitting, non-stop comedy.

637269,5,6303338690,"I rented this movie for my 6 year old son -wow! I guess I enjoyed it just like he did.  I had wanted to by the vhs a while ago but something kept telling me to wait a little and that the dvd would come sooner or later. Well, here it is! This is a great movie for kids but beware- you might get hooked- don't say I did't tell you. Get it now!",1056672000,,341,3.608108108108108
637270,5,6303338690,"I was trying to introduce my grandson Tayte (who is 4) to new movies besides Barney and Bob the Builder so when he would come to my office 1 day a week we would go to the library and I would sneek a differant movie in for him to watch. We would rent 5 for the week for him to take home. I rented Little Giants and much to my delight he loved it, he felt sad for the kids that weren't picked for the team and loved the parts where they came back and won with just sheer determination. We now rent it every other week for him.  He is even starting to try new ones. It's the kind of movie that every age level can identify with.",1040774400,,625,3.8449612403100777

637272,5,6303338690,This is a fun family movie that kids and adults will enjoy watching together. It's about 2 brothers Kevin and Danny O Shea wo don't really get along that well decide to coach 2 football teams that will compete against each other. Great film with lots of action and laughs. The acting in the film is also very good by the coaches and all the kids. My favorite part was when coach Kevin O Shea was teaching his team how to tackle his niece Becky and he fell out the window landing on a tree!! That part nearly put me in tears.,1028246400,,524,4.147058823529412
637273,5,6303338690,"Matthew, our 6-year old son, loved this movie.  (His mom and dad enjoyed it, too!)  This story brought humor and inspiration to the littlest giant in our house. It also communicated to him that, sometimes, all it takes is just ""one time"" to make a difference!
Parents may also watch this and be inclined to look back on the reality of youth...reminding us that the being the coolest of jocks or most popular of prom queens won't determine or LIMIT our destiny as we mature.",980726400,12,473,4.552941176470588

637275,5,6303338690,"This was a great little movie, especially for those of us who were always picked last in gym class. The ""rejects"" (led by a sympathetic father and his daughter, who desperately wants to be treated equal by her football-playing male peers and their very unreasonable coach, her uncle) learn to work together and show themselves as the winners that they truly are.
As usual, Rick Moranis does a great job blending comedy with his ability to portray heartfelt, ""growing as we go"" parenting. There is a little bit of ""scatalogical"" humor in this (bathroom jokes), but all in all it is a great testimony to the value of working together and accepting people as they are.",977270400,,665,4.741379310344827

637277,5,6303338690,"I really loved this movie. If possible, they should produce a reunion of the Little Giants. I think it would be cool. Well really that's all I had to say about it. All in All I loved it!",960076800,,186,3.9210526315789473
