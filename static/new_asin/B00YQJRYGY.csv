7223795,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max Fury Road defines the words fast and furious much more so than the Vin Dielsel movies. The movie is bad ass and insane from start to finish. I was just disappointed that it doesn't really take time to reintroduce Max to new audiences background wise. I guess the girl Max hallucinates seeing from time to time is supposed to be the child he lost in the first film despite his child being a boy toddler in that. So I guess this is more of a reboot than a sequel with minor changes.
  In Fury Road Max finds himself on the run with some pregnant brides from a slaver who wants them back. That's about all there is plot wise. A long crazy and violent and well shot car chase through the dessert. However Mad Max films always were great without having strong plots and the same can be said for this film. While Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron and Nicolas Hoult are all in top form. It's Hoult who gets the best line though ""what a lovely day!"" while driving through a deadly storm.
  The film grips you and never lets go with kick ass action and stunts. The visuals and musical score are also amazing. Mad Max Fury Road hopefully makes enough money for a 5th film that takes a little bit more time developing Max. And maybe on just a little bit less acid. I'd probably enjoy it either way since this film kicks major ass.",1431648000,2,1320,4.289156626506024
7223796,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Its pretty rare that a summer spectacle lives up to the hype it generates beforehand.  But Mad Max: Fury Road lives up to it and then some.

And it ought to, costing over $100 million when The Road Warrior cost a little over 300 grand in 1981.  But the CGI is never intrusive, and the chase scenes all deliver with bulldozers when other movies use mere spades.  Its an endless dusty procession of the usual suspects: Big Rigs fabricated out of classic cars and steel drums, a 1930s street rod turned into a monster truck, not one but two Falcon Interceptors with superchargers protruding through their hoods.  And of course, the parade would not be complete without the boss ride, a fire-breathing beast stitched together from two Sputnik-era Cadillacs and a set of tires appropriate for a dump truck the size of your house.  (For some reason, there are no Toyota Priuses and Honda crossovers in the apocalypse.  Maybe they were all recalled.) There are enough custom-forged steering wheels, odd weapons, and feats of scrappy medieval-futurist engineering to fill every frame of the movie.

I grew up watching a grainy VHS recording of The Road Warrior over and over again, and on that level of nostalgia, there were plenty of Easter eggs: a little wind-up music box and a misfiring sawed-off shotgun, for example.  Even the actor who played Toecutter in the first Mad Max movie is back here to portray a milk-obsessed asthmatic megalomaniac (think of the demented clown in the Twisted Metal game series, sporting a Darth Vader-style breathing apparatus and a Steampunk / Clockwork Orange sense of nihilism).

In some corners of the Internet, there has been chatter about the newest Mad Max movie being sexist because women feature prominently in the story.  The theory is that the Mad Max movies are about guys bashing cars into each other, and why should there be any chicks around anyway?  Theyll probably just pester us with honey-do lists and stern admonitions regarding our worst habits.  Ill stop chewing on my thumb later.

Two reasons why this theory is rubbish: 1) it ignores the plain fact that women figured prominently in all three of the earlier movies, and 2) they represent a reason why anyone in such a desolate setting wouldnt just off himself with any of the 5,000 lethal objects within arms reach.  There is no future without reproduction, and the movies villainthe aforementioned milk-swilling clown from hellwants a harem to secure his pharaoh-like line in perpetuity.  You there!  Die for Valhalla or the Green Place or whatever.  Meanwhile, hows your sister?

That is whats great about Mad Max: Fury Road.  It adds layers of greater depth not by adding more dialogue or plot or anything else that gets in the way of the endless chase.  It keeps up the action, yet also raises the stakes higher than just getting more gas so I can chase down more people and take their gas too.

This movie was more fun than I have had in a theater in years.  Go see it, and then go see it again.",1431648000,5,3002,4.7528957528957525

acting, and on first viewing, it may seem that way. But Tom Hardy was playing Max very realistically. Max is a man traumatized and haunted by
his past, living in a hellish world where life is cheap, and survival extremely difficult. A man like this would be very guarded, bottled up tight. He
would neither smile, nor speak easily with most people. You might like to see a more animated and affable Max, but that would not be true to
character. Don't try to compare him to Mel Gibson, either. They are both playing their own interpretations of Max. Overall, I think that this is an
outstanding addition to the Mad Max series.",1532131200,,768,4.453900709219858

7223821,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The film has already been summed up by thousands of people already, but heres my take on it anyway.

Mad Max Fury Road is an excellent action movie.  It had a lot of positive reviews for the movie upon its theatrical release.  Yet I was hesitant to really want to go see this movie.  I am not a big fan of reboot films.  The new crop of directors almost always screw up the backstory for well-known movies.  It seems to be an ongoing trend in Hollywood to either over explain the backstory ruining all the mystery or intrigue from the base material IE Rob Zombies Halloween films, Star Wars Prequels, The Hobbit Trilogy etc etc. Or the new films do the opposite insert a 10 second quickie flashback scene to fill the viewers in on what is going on.  Neither option works very well or does justice to the source material.  By having an opening text or monologue like in at the beginning of The Road Warrior might have been the best way to go to start off this film.  Other than that this is a highly entertaining action movie.

I for one am getting burnt out on all the goody two shoes superhero films coming out from Marvel every other weekend.  Thankfully Mad Max is an action movie that has meat and bones to it.  You will see violence and real injuries not 1000 shots fired and nobody getting hurt like the A-team, Transformers, Marvel films etc etc.

I think they got the bleak apocalyptic landscape right and the film definitely gives you that thrill ride feeling.  I found Immortan Joes compound fascinating.  Joe is a very scary looking villain.  Nux and the followers of Joe truly are crazy but interesting at the same time.

I am a big fan of the original Max Max and The Road Warrior films.  They are both very good action movies with great stunts.  MM3 Beyond Thunderdome not so much, but at least it was interesting and had some good scenes.  Who can forget 2 Men enter, 1 Man Leave.  That aside I wondered how the franchise would continue without Mel Gibson as the lead actor in all 3 of the previous films.  Thankfully Tom Hardie does a great job.  I liked him as Max I just wish he had a little more dialogue in the film.  You can tell he is a tortured soul but you are never really told why.
I do agree with some other people that the main hero of the story is not really Max but Furiosa.  Most of the film really revolves around her trying to escape with the other breeding wives of Immortan Joe.  The chase scenes are very good.  The CGI blended very well into the movie without looking phony or fake.  I always enjoy practical effects when possible over CGI but this film works on just about every level.

I would give this film 5 stars.  At times it feels like a rehash of The Road Warrior but the character are all interesting and the new characters motives and actions all make sense.  This is a popcorn movie done right.",1531699200,,2843,4.347908745247148

Wrapped in a simple main plot, this movie delivers very engaging and well motivated action. The effects and practical stunt work is great, and in general the movie is full of great visuals. Although uncomplicated at the surface level, there are interesting characters to root for. Also, the rich visuals hold interesting tidbits of background information on the world, which makes repeat viewings interesting. This includes the costume designs of both heroes and villains, as well as the vehicles they use and the scenery they travel through. Tom Hardy is a great Max, but Charlize Theron's Furiosa is the emotional core of the movie and definitely steals the show. The acting is great in general and succeeds at selling the movie's main conflict convincingly.

7223887,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is an Action that is all or nothing and the amount of production/work that went into this movie is stellar.

Very little use of CGI.

This movie is more than just an ""Action Movie,"" it is a movie that has the ability to heighten your sense and take your breathe away literally. I've never felt a movie of this genre feel more real than this one.

Watch it, enjoy it and be amazed. You won't regret it.

Watch all the bonus behind-the-scenes as well. You won't believe how much went into this film, it's insane. Plus it won six Oscars (nominated for ten).",1523923200,,559,4.346153846153846
7223888,2,B00YQJRYGY,"This review is not for the movie itself, and not for any physical media release, but for Amazon Video's streaming quality. Mad Max is a phenomenal, near-perfect film and I was dying to see the black-and-chrome version. I saw it at a friend's, also on blu-ray, and was blown away. But since I already owned the standard, black-and-chrome free version of the blu-ray disc I opted to just buy the streaming version of this movie from Amazon.

You will be disappointed. The compression results in huge levels of pixelation and banding. Night scenes are borderline unwatchable. I tried streaming this movie from both an Amazon Fire TV and an Apple TV 4K via the Amazon app, and both produced the same pixelated results - I know this isn't an internet connection issue, because 4K streaming from other services works great and requires much more data than this 1080p stream. I hope Amazon figures out their compression problems in the future - for now, especially on black and white films, it kind of sucks.",1523923200,,1001,4.786127167630058

7223891,5,B00YQJRYGY,"As far as action adrenaline films go, Mad Max: Fury Road 3D is about as good as it gets. The action is mostly practical and as good as good gets. The movie is a beginning to end adrenaline rush with pauses in action in between to catch your breath. The best part of the film is that the action pushes the story, so nothing feels forced, and everything that happens feels organic. The story is strong for this type of film, with just enough back story for the title character to get the gist of who he was, while leaving you wanting to learn more about who he is. The supporting cast and baddies and very strong as well, especially Furiosa played by Charlize Theron. Some of the film was built to be viewed in 3D as well, which was a nice touch to justify the niche media format. Cant wait for the next one, whenever, and if ever it comes out.

7223928,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Pretty Boring.  Max shoulda been runnin' around in the Maxmobile, but nooooo....they had to make this something which would show us the 'softer' side, a real 'human-interst story' of the Wasteland.  In today's #meMeMe environment, MM5 should appeal to the anti-male attitudes en vogue today.

The bright spots come pretty much from the mobile-rock-n-roll, head-banger semi-truck (why not more of this type of quirkiness?), Charlize Theron's solid acting ability.  Also Tom Hardy's vulnerable, yet tough persona with very little dialogue was strong.

Nonetheless, this movie is a Chase Movie...but don't get excited, most of the chase is, again, pretty boring.
When they do the sequel (do you think they will? haha), there needs to be better attention to the action.  Don't worry so much about the 'plot', but be more interesting with the gratuity.  That's why we watched 'Road Warrior'.",1520294400,,886,5.285714285714286

7223955,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Fantastic film, probably the closest to being a perfect action movie than any other. The Black & Chrome edition does enhance some scenes, but is overall inferior to the regular edition. The scenes where the image is sharp is better looking in B&C edition, while the rest of the movie looks better in color because the image is softer. I think the softer images are the product of using software to artificially reduce the shaking. This isn't noticeable in the regular edition because of high contrast color. On the other hand, instances where the images are sharp don't look as good in color because the extremely sharp images with high contrast are distracting -- this isn't a problem in B&C edition.

[TL;DR] It isn't worth buying B&C edition unless you fancy yourself a collector. Otherwise, rent the B&C movie.",1518134400,,814,4.856115107913669

I ended up having my mind blown. It is true that the whole movie is a big car chase, but in a way that's just the basic layer which achieves the effect of presenting a bunch of feelings and gives rise to various metaphorical interpretations. At the same time, it ends up having a decent and powerful story as well (not very complicated I admit, but it does not need to be).

7223991,5,B00YQJRYGY,"That was nuts. Thats my girlfriends word-for-word quote on our way out of the theater. She had never seen any of the Mad Max movies before, so she didn't know what to expect. I have seen all three of the Mel Gibson Mad Max movies, and its pretty safe to say Im a fan. I even put The Road Warrior on my Should Have Won Best Picture list.

To be honest, however, when I heard they were making another Mad Max movie, I was very skeptical. Thunderdome is better than you remember, but it is the weakest of the first three. Sequels that come out more than ten years after the original are rarely, if ever, good movies. Its been thirty. It sounded to me like a cynical cash grab. I also read about the delays in production and other problems on set (not the least of which was Gibsons very public fall from grace) and expected a disaster. Then, I saw this trailer:

My mouth dropped, and I was blown away. I cant remember a trailer that hooked me so quickly, or strongly. (Whoever created it deserves some kind of award.) Then, the reviews that came in were overwhelmingly positive. This, I figured, was the summer movie to see. I figured right.

If heavy metal was a movie instead of a music genre, this would be it. (Forget the cartoon from the 80s.) Blood, skulls, metal, motors, fire, spikes, guitars, gasoline, dirt, and scantily dressed babes. Thats metal, and thats Mad Max: Fury Road. You don't have to be a fan of heavy metal to enjoy this movie, however. If you appreciate the art of cinema, you will most likely enjoy it. There is so much to love about this movie; Ill do my best to touch on as many elements as I can remember. Witness me!

Pros

  The action. This had to be number one on my list. The action is almost non-stop from the movies start until the explosive finale, but its varied enough in intensity to keep the audience invested in the ride. This is a chase movie, after all. The best scene is the one teased in the trailer. Its the first battle involving a giant dust storm, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was physically drained after the sequence and I actually breathed a sigh of relief when it ended. The computer effects are blended seamlessly with the practical stunts, of which there are many. The result is pure audience immersion and investment. Any action movie to follow has a tough act to follow. What a lovely day, indeed.
  The sets/props. The vehicle design appealed both to the ten-year-old kid in me that liked to play with toy cars and to the designer in me that appreciates practical design. These vehicles all belonged to this world, and they all served a purpose (while looking insanely badass). Even the flamethrower guitar and drum truck (which was added out of sheer joy for the sake of being over-the-top, Im sure) seemed to serve the purpose of boosting the War Boys morale.
  The costumes/makeup. The costumes and makeup design were top notch as well. The villains all looked both human and monstrous at the same time. The War Boys used oil, grease, and chrome as war paint, to a very unique and original effect. The Wives costumes objectified them, while at the same time empowering them. The objectification comes from the fact that they were sex slaves dressed by their captor. The empowerment comes from how they wore them, and owned them. Furiosas (Theron) robotic arm looked real, and it served a grander purpose (which I won't spoil here).
  The editing. Ive read that action movies are the most difficult to edit. Stay too long on a shot, and the audience will bore. Cut too quickly and theyll miss whats happening. The editor here, who I think is Millers wife, does a fantastic job of finding the happy medium.
  The acting. Tom Hardy is great as Max. He doesnt say much; its mostly a physical performance. Gibson is better, but the comparison is unfair as he had three movies to tackle the role, and he had a lot more dialogue. Hardys Max is definitely crazier. Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villain Toecutter in the original movie, is back in Fury Road as Immortan Joe. Hes absolutely terrifying as an aging tyrant. His performance is a bit over the top, but it needed to be. Charlize Therons Furiosa steals the show, however. This is her movie. Her performance runs from badass to heartbroken to hopeless to triumphant in the span of the movies two hour run time. Shes the most interesting character, and the one you root for the most.
  The photography. This is a beautiful movie to look at. One reviewer remarked that the desert looked cartoonish. I disagree. I thought the CGI was blended expertly. The hot reds, oranges and yellows of the daytime battles contrasted beautifully with the deep blue of the night scenes. You could watch this movie and enjoy it just for the cinematography.
  The sound. The soundtrack jarred my insides. You felt every car flip, every gunshot, every explosion. This is a loud movie, but its supposed to be.
  The directing. Miller waited thirty years for the follow up, but he delivered in every way. The director brings everything together, and he shared his vision like an expert. The audience is truly immersed in this world. Im impressed.
  No Gibson cameo. I was afraid there would be a Mel Gibson cameo in this movie, but that fear proved unfounded. A Gibson cameo would have taken the audience out of the world, so Im glad it didn't happen.

Cons

There really isn't much wrong with this movie; it was a little bit difficult for me to think of any cons. However, I was able to manage a couple:

  The plot. Fury Road is basically The Road Warrior with a higher budget. Sex slaves have been swapped in for gasoline as the chases spark. Im totally okay with this, but I can understand some moviegoers complaint in this department.
  Its not Maxs movie (see The acting above). Again, Im okay with this, but I understand the gripes. Furiosa (Theron) is the star of this movie, not Max. I read one review that calls her a Moses character, and Max is her Joshua. I mostly agree with that. The protests over the movies feminism are very stupid. Whats wrong with a testosterone fueled picture that also empowers women? Everybody wins, I say.

Mad Max: Fury Road is the best movie Ive seen (so far) this year. Its a pure joy to watch, and George Miller, once again, thoroughly immerses you in his nightmare world. Although The Road Warrior is still my favorite in the series, Fury Road takes a very close second. Make sure you watch it on the big screen. Its mad.

7224019,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Full  disclosure,  I'm  not  a  Mad  Max  fan,  I  never  watched  the  originals  so  some  subtle  references  were  probably  lost  on  me.  That  beign  said,  Fury  Road  is  just  okay.  No  sure  why  this  was  rated  R,  there  was  one  vague  scene  of  gore  and  no  full  nudity,  nor  even  partial  nudity  for  that  matter,  and  only  a  little  language.  The  worst  of  this  movie  is  just  vagueness.  Who  are  these  villains?  What's  the  place  they're  headed?  What  the  heck  is  that  storm?  Who  killed  the  earth?  That  last  one  is  a  part  of  a  pretty  flimsy  environmental/anti-war  message  that  get  mostly  ignored.  Tom  Hardy  does  a  pretty  decent  job,  he  seems  like  an  actually  mentally  unstable  man  instead  of  the  brooding  tough  guy  stereotype,  which  is  a  welcome  breath  of  fresh  air.  Understand,  there  is  a  ton  of  car  battles,  but  if  you're  expecting  Mad  Max's  car  to  be  a  big  part,  you'll  be  disappointed.  90%  of  this  movie,  the  main  vehicle  is  a  big  rig  tanker.  The  break  out  star  in  this  is  Nux,  played  by  Nicholas  Hoult.  I  can't  say  much  about  him  without  giving  plot  detail,  but  he's  got  the  best  character  arc  of  the  entire  cast.  The  female  lead,  Furiosa,  played  by  Charlize  Theron,  is  also  a  breath  of  fresh  air,  being  a  rounded  character  instead  of  the  ""strong  female  character"".  The  antagonist  is  just  kind  of  lacking  really,  he  wasn't  intimidating,  and  he  has  no  character  or  purpose  other  than  to  get  the  plot  rolling  (ha!).  Honestly  the  acting  from  most  of  the  cast  is  top  notch,  as  is  the  character  writing,  which  makes  it  kind  of  disappointing  that  the  plot  is  so  vague  and  the  story  so  basic.  The  car  battles  are  good,  entertaining  and  well  choreographed  if
 a  little  lacking  in  suspense.  Overall,  if  you're  looking  to  kill  some  time,  this  will  entertain,  but  don't  expect  a  masterpiece.",1512864000,,2068,4.550632911392405

7224027,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I reviewed the film 'Starship Troopers' by noting that violence, death, and action on-screen (and one might add, giant spectacles) seem to engender a kind of hero-worship in men who watch. They are somehow awed by the destruction the filmmakers are allowed to get away with showing (or frightened) by the cruel fates met out to those on-screen. Viewers are sort of browbeaten into a kind of admiration for what is being shown. That might describe what is going on with this film. Not only is Fury Road 2 hours of nonstop action and violence, for the most part, the characters on screen seem to be enjoying their life-or-death experiences. As Mad Max traverses the post-apocalyptic wasteland he meets up with various gangs who seem to control different sections of turf and each gang sets out defeat the convoy of interlopers passing through. That's pretty much what the film consists of. If you want to know what the details of day-to-day life might be like in this post-apocalyptic world you won't get it by watching Mad Max: Fury Road. Gangs Mad Max comes across include 'The 'Bullet Boys', a gang of bikers, the gang he's tagging along with, 'The War Boys' and the 'Many Mothers', a female gang whose slogan is 'One man, one bullet'. Members of each gang seem to enjoy the life-or-death action they are caught up in; they seem, not be afraid, but to be enjoying themselves. Perhaps more reason for us to be intimidated by (and to like) this film? I went to see Road Fury with a friend, and while he seemed to be enjoying himself he felt the film was kind of silly, Road Fury was the most fun nonsense has ever been. When I mentioned I might review the film he said, be sure to point out that, after all the struggle, all they do is go back to the place they started out from.

I've talked about violence in films on previous occasions before . . . What is the deal, especially in this film where violence and life and death is portrayed as fun? Are we being intimidated in an effort to lighten our wallets? Do we feel guilt, for not being as brave as the actors on screen? I remember the band Metallica had a song that went something like, 'You dirty, you coward, you blind man; back to the front"". Is it like a Western shown on black and white TV, showing men (with eagle eyes), and guns ready, not afraid to use lethal violence in what may be some kind of an attempt to prevent racial violence or a race war? Is this film making an effort to increase violence in society . . . Are we even meant to internalize violence?

At the end of action movies or movies marketed toward men, the guy often gets the girl and there might be a kiss at the end. What we want (as men, or perhaps as humans) is power. What we get, after all this violence and mayhem (this very cool violence), are brainwashing love scenes. They may be harder for us to turn away from and resist . . . but they're not what we want.

Mad Max: Fury Road received some criticism upon its release from the 'Manosphere' (basically, anti-feminists who post online). One wrote, 'Fury Road is the vehicle those in power will use to force a lecture on feminism down your throat . . .  this is the subterfuge they will use to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity, further ruining women for men, and men for women'. One said, 'Don't give those who hate you, and want you dead or enslaved, your money'

Rather than having a legitimate beef, I wonder if those in the Manosphere are objecting to something that advantages them; has the Manosphere arrived, simply becoming another pressure group? The objections they make seem to be about there being a female hero, or more correctly, a female co-hero. Of course, at the end, the female gang seems to win. There is a female co-hero as a way to make more money, some say. I myself claim (of television), 'that is why ratings are the number most important feature of any show, if no one is watching, the propaganda serves no purpose'. While there is a female co-hero, the images this film show, in the end, revolve around a boy meets girl theme. This film is aggrandizing male-female relationships. Even one of the bad-guys becomes a love interest. One of the guys, constantly having his teeth painted (because he wants to look good when he passes over into the afterlife [one of the cool images in the film] ) becomes a love interest. Despite starting off as a bad guy he becomes likable. There was a character like this in the film 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome' as well. I'm thinking 'Gyro Captain', the young man in that earlier movie who manages to have a flying jalopy and somehow becomes cute and likable. He was the only one in this future who managed to have a working airplane. In this film, we learn to like (if not fall in love with) one of the guys in the War Boys gang. I give the new Mad Max: Road Fury a tentative thumbs up, but most of the film is so nonsensical, it is a very generous 3 stars.

Are we at the end of the era of the female action star or will this be a constant theme in movies? I recall critic Roger Ebert, towards the end of his career, pondering, 'Why is it that boys so want to see female action stars'? Was Roger Ebert's statement ludicrous or disingenuous or both? Mr. Ebert had spent the previous 30 years or more of his career following the party line, that women are (noble) disadvantaged victims and he never missed an opportunity to greatly praise female heroines. Better late to the party than never, but this question was all that was to be gotten out of the Mr. Ebert. Of course there is the later Mr. Ebert's (and his generations) legacy left behind. No doubt their supporters would pass off this kind of thing as equality when the reality is that is extreme favoritism. It has it's opposite as well, there is more here than favoritism. There is more here the advantaging the already advantaged, giving more protections to the only group ever protect, it has its opposite, demoralization. It has it's opposite, demoralization and dehumanization, attempting to reduce half the population to beneath consideration (and frankly doing so).

To rant more about the Manosphere, I often find those interested in men's issues to simply be reactionary, when reacting to the lie only serves to give it more power? It certainly helps frame the issue at the center of the picture? Further more, after decades of men supporting and defending women, now that women earn more money than men, men are finally getting up the nerve to say, 'I won't financially support a woman'? I remember an anti-feminist, Esther Vilar, who claimed that men have been so conditioned it would be inconceivable for a man to expect a woman to support him (physically) or in a financial way. She claimed, the only thing men ever stand to gain from a relationship with a woman is (her words) ""the periodic use of a woman's vagina"". Now that women are making more money than men, and now that 60 million men have immigrated into the country over the last 40 years, to join the 60 million men already living here, many native-born men won't be supporting a woman, even if they desperately want to. Now, you say you won't support a woman? Fighting all odds, your cause is not supporting a woman financially? I can't help but wonder, of those who lead the men's movement and the Manosphere, if their true intention is to push a kind of irony. Of course, I've claimed, of the leadership of the burgeoning alt-right, their goal is to promote white guilt, or moral equivalency, as far into the future as it is possible to do so. I say these kinds of things.

Fury Road seems to be trying to make money and seems to be normalizing or showcasing violence. The film also pushes images encouraging men and women to get with one another. I don't know what to say about that except to make the claim and to note it, and to say, as a man, perhaps you should take any help in that regards that you can get?",1512172800,,7915,4.487855655794587

7224030,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is a review for the Black and Chrome version. Full disclosure, Mad Max Fury Road is one of my favorite films of all time. I was never a real fan of the previous Mad Max films (they were fine for what they were and when they came out) and I don't particularly care for action movies. Fury Road, to me, is such a perfect example of tight editing (there is never a wasted shot, the pacing is perfect) as well as every other thing it's been praised for.

As for the Black and Chrome version...I really liked it!

Some say ""it's like watching a whole new film, man!"" I could see that! Adjusting to the black and white (very sharp contrasts) took a little bit to adjust to. I had competing feelings when I was adjusting to this new style, such as ""Wow, everything looks like it's in 3D"" to ""the contrast is too bright and it's distracting"". But in the end, I was actually able to pick up even MORE details in this film that I've seen 7 times so far. The film has a more stylized feel, almost like reading a story book, if that makes sense. The lack of color ... actually, that's a negative thing to say...the crisp ""pop"" of every character and scenery and clouds and debris allows the audience to view each frame in a new way. What I said about the story book feel earlier can be applied if you pause almost any scene in the film. Imagine that! Imagine pausing at ANY point in this black and chrome movie and that still can be a beautiful photograph from a story book. THAT is the genius of George Miller.

This version won't be for everyone, and that's OK. Give it a try, even if that requires a slightly more intentional viewing. Even if the lack of color is off-putting at first, I bet the rich story and characters will suck you in.",1511740800,3,1735,4.251515151515152

I came across this movie and since it was free I watched it because I do like Charlize Theron. I was BLOWN AWAY. I did not expect to even like this movie, much less watch it like 5 times in one weekend and then actually buy it. Others have done better at plot and points, but to people who are on the fence about watching it because this is not their type, but who enjoy a quality film- watch it.",1510185600,,521,3.9714285714285715

I always thought the movie itself quite odd, but very unique, so I like it.  It's amazing that for the vast majority of scenes, they're constantly moving. Think about what it would take to film that!",1508803200,,476,4.588235294117647

I do not like watching 3D movies at home, they make me too dizzy, but in the larger theater, they're excellent now (unlike the old days).  Now with the aid of computers, the special effects are just totally awesome (& I don't mean that like I'm some 20 year old, I mean they are truly spectacular and so far advanced & improved over the old style special effects, where we could still see the strings, and know that a fire was still just a back lot fire).  It amazes me that they can now use a computer to remove an actors limb & make it look so realistic, and with such a great cast (particular Charlize Therron, & I hope I spelled it correctly, because she was beyond supurb in this film), it was just phenomenal.

7224075,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is one of those films that begs the question: 4K or 3D? Personally, I prefer 3D whenever possible and that remains true with FURY ROAD, however that shouldn't discount the amazing presentation here. The detail and colors are tremendous thanks to HDR, with the only very minor complaint coming from the various flames looking a bit too fake. All that said, the Dolby Atmos soundtrack is simply breathtaking, just as it was in the 3D release. This gets my highest recommendation.

7224088,2,B00YQJRYGY,"If you are a Mad Max series fan you may want to set this one out What a dreary, repetitive flick. Bad guys chase a truck full of beautiful women wrapped in less than sufficient gauzy coverings (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zo Kravitz, Courtney Eaton, Abbey Kershaw, and Danielle Riley Keough) running from the bad guy (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his group of post apocalyptic motor heads accompanied by amazing pyrotechnics and stunt driving/dying...then chase it again...and again...and (guess what) AGAIN! Probably great viewing for a 13 year old boy. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are unable to save this film as there is no story line for them.

7224091,2,B00YQJRYGY,"So I'm in the process of trying to make myself like Tom Hardy and this movie was the next effort. Also, I liked The Road Warrior movie. Because everyone and their pet parakeet wet themselves over this film, I was curious to see if it was all that.

It was not.

I will say except for a couple of dead spots there was always something happening. Was it interesting what was happening? Eh, not really. Like Rogue One, the final action sequence is the only thing redeeming Fury Road and why I'm generously giving it two stars.

Edit: I even gave this a second watch (which I rarely do) just to see if my mind could be changed. I figured out the only people I cared about in this story were the little old ladies on motorcycles and they don't show up until like 1 1/2 hours in. This should be a lesson for all film makers out there. It doesn't matter how much money you throw at the screen, how many explosions or stunts you squeeze in, or any of your cutting edge CGI. As a storyteller your first and foremost mission should be to MAKE ME CARE.",1504396800,,1041,4.221105527638191

Somehow felt far more polished than the CGI fests that modern action movies have become.  Great production value, soundtrack was on point.  Dialogue was a little hard to hear/follow at times but I was still able to keep pace with the story telling.

Always found that boring.  However I enjoyed this movie so much that I even had to buy it.

Many of the supporting casts accents were so thick that I had to turn on subtitles just to understand them. Special effects were over the top and I wish Amazon prime gave refunds on instant Amazon movie rentals that sucked. I think the original Mad Max movie was far superior, skip this damn remake.

If that's the only thing you're looking for in a movie then you might like this, but whenever I started to get into this it would immediately switch to an absurd CGI scene or a scene that highlighted how little sense there is in this dystopian world.

Major plot holes that could easily have fixed with back story at the beginning like in every freaking Mad Max movie ever made. George Miller embarrassed and stained himself by producing this filth!

7224158,5,B00YQJRYGY,Currently watching B&C edition and it is indeed an entirely different universe than the color version.  There is very much a past/future world vision on an alternative reality.  The sound and effects feed off this unrelatable vast wasteland of a landscape.  See it once and you Will understand.

Astonishing that this movie received so many good reviews.

7224172,5,B00YQJRYGY,"In the past I have avoided seeing a movie in 3D if it was not filmed in 3D (I am looking at you, Clash of the Titans.)  However it seems like the effects houses have gotten this figured out, both The Force Awakens and Mad Max Fury Road are excellent 3D titles and neither were shot in 3D.
I won't get into a movie review too much, but I thought Fury Road was a worth addition to the Mad Max story.  I was not wild about Tom Hardy's interpretation of Max (I really wish Mel Gibson hadn't gone nuts and could have done this film) but the new characters are engaging and the action is top notch.
Both the desolation of the open spaces and the closeness of the interior environments are improved by the 3D.  Apart from the absurd steering wheel that flies right at the screen the film is devoid of effects that draw attention to themselves.  In defense of the 3D version that steering wheel gag is just as distractingand annoying in 2D.
If you like the franchise you will like this movie.  If you like this movie you will enjoy the extra value of the 3D version.",1498521600,,1058,4.243781094527363

7224178,1,B00YQJRYGY,Had they decided to make a whole new IP out of this movie would be a 2.5 or a 3 (the story is still crap). But nope they hung a Mad Max name off it and then made him a supporting character of dubious value to the story. It is a 1 because it can't be lower.,1497830400,,256,3.508771929824561

7224182,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Action Cinema at the artistic vista of eye-candy, atmosphere, and character development. It does not drag enough to bore, yet leaves much room for fleshing out ""lean"" characters in potential sequels.

 From minute 1, an in-your-face-middle-finger-nitro-boosted-immersion will take you away, yielding to the action here and there just enough to let you love/hate a character more and BAM! -- you're off to the next scene with your stomach in your throat ...my favorite of all time in this genre since 2015...to be replaced someday by another masterpiece...or not.

** As a side note, I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to add a subtle amount of humorous horror (dark as it were) to bridge the authenticity for old fans of the originals like me, and the newer folks that have not seen the classics with Gibson...which btw, if you have not seen the classics, please do as it will take you to the roots of Mad Max lore...",1497571200,,929,4.830188679245283

7224184,2,B00YQJRYGY,Charlize Theron  may have been the only worthwhile acting performance in the movie. Pretty sure the Mad Max series just had a stake driven through it's heart. I really liked the previous films. This one was just a mess. And really not even consistent with the back story. The flashback stuff (little girls face)? What a waste.,1497571200,,326,4.719298245614035

7224186,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I can watch this over and over, it never gets old. Lots of action. Great camera work and locations, but the story is unoriginal and predictable.  ""Mad Max"" meets ""Handmaid's Tale,"" ""Children of Men,"" ""Gattaca"" and the like.  Another film about reproduction/fertility which provides men an excuse to control women, prompting women to escape. This one is set in a dystopic wasteland populated by malformed, degenerating ""War Boys."" Furiosa drives the movie as well as her semi, Tom Hardy adds nothing, not even a pretty face and yet Charlize gets 2nd billing!  (That can't be right.)  Powerful female portrayals, but Hardy's Max is reactive not an active.  His Max is just a guy who would be passive at home watching TV if the world hadn't ended and people weren't trying to kill him - you'd never guess he's been living in a violent wasteland for years.  Love the action, not happy with the story line or Hardy's characterization of Max.",1497484800,,936,4.81875

7224254,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Five EPIC Stars. Director George Miller has unleashed a grand-looking $150 Million budgeted epic SciFi movie. This gritty, bloody, action-adventure movie, ""Mad Max-Fury Road"" is set in the bleak, dystopian future world as were the three previous Mad Max movies which starred Mel Gibson. Society is no better off now than before as everything is scarce and it has collapsed into smaller, brutal, socio-economic communities. Max, played excellently by Tom Hardy, haunted by events from his past, is pursued by a group which wants him. Meanwhile, Furiosa, a high-ranking female who is played with abandon by Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, sets off on a bloody run down Fury Road that will lead straight into adventure, spectacular battles, amazing-looking vehicles, and mind-boggling mechanical assemblages, amid some awesome physical stunts in these desert vistas. Co-starring Nicholas Hoult, Richard Norton, Josh Helman, Nathan Jones, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Zo Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whitley, Riley Keough (Elvis' granddaughter), Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton, among others. A memorable SciFi epic. I rented it then I went back and bought it. My Highest Recommendation. Five MIND-BENDING Stars. (Warner Bros. pictures, Roadside Attractions Pictures. Rated R. Color. HD. CC.

7224266,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I'll start off by saying I love the movie -- it's a fun movie with a lot of great cinematography and over-the-top action scenes.

This review focuses more on the different versions of the film:

Having bought the Blu-Ray, Black & Chrome set & Blu-Ray 3D previously, I wanted to see what the 4K experience was like.

Blu-Ray: Looks great. Sounds great. Overall very good experience.

Black & Chrome set: Definitely recommended; includes both the original blu-ray and a black & white version which is a totally different experience. Not the same as just lowering the color on your TV.. this one really ""shines"" (no pun intended). Even after watching the normal version several times, this felt like a totally new movie.

3D: Again, a totally unique experience that was a lot of fun. Good 3D popout and depth.. Alongside the  Black and Chrome version, this is tied for my favorite version of the film. Also includes the 2D Blu-Ray.

4K: And here's where I was disappointed. I have a high-end UHD Player (Oppo 203), high-end 4K OLED (LG 65c6p) and was excited for it. Unfortunately.. it didn't deliver. In fact, parts even look worse.
The film is slightly re-colored using the HDR toning (apparently this was done from the original master rather than the same as the previous releases). Beyond that, CGI becomes very noticeable (stuff that looked real in all the other versions looked very fake in this one; the fire, backgrounds and more all looked pretty bad and stood out). The film is also very noisy; apparently this was part of the original effect, but the 4K significantly enhances it and it doesn't look good.  Lastly, the overall increase in sharpness isn't as significant as you would like. I will say that the first few chapters were significantly worse than the later chapters and I don't know why.
Of all the versions I've watched, the 4K was the least impressive. I went in with mixed expections on what to expect (some reviews are very positive, others very poor) and unfortunately wasn't impressed.",1490486400,97,2010,4.805797101449276
7224267,5,B00YQJRYGY,I bought this after I saw the movie on the big screen.  I think it's well done and the special effects are far above average.,1490400000,,125,4.0
7224268,4,B00YQJRYGY,"First, disengage your brain because its all about the action, vehicles and special effects. Its not even a movie about Max as much as it is about Furiosa. The plot shouldnt really matter to most viewers since it has one thats so shallow you couldn't drown in it. It also ahs its share of skinny babes in flimsy clothing. I kind of like a bit of a plot and some understandable dialog but if you don't care about that type of trivia just enjoy the babble, wrecks, flaming vehicles, explosions, carnage and only the heroes survive theme. If you're looking for about Mad Max this really isn't it and other than a few grunts I don't think he spoke till about the middle of the movie. Its a solid 5-stars for action minus for everything else.",1490400000,,736,4.419117647058823

7224276,5,B00YQJRYGY,"One of my all time favorite films. Action is great, and easy to follow, but also if you look a little deeper there is symbolism and meaning everywhere in this movie.",1490140800,,165,4.354838709677419
7224277,3,B00YQJRYGY,"For an action movie there was little action, just a lot of vehicles that looked like they were designed by a twelve year old boy driving through the desert with a lot of quick cuts, pans, and shaking cameras to make it look like they're driving really fast. What's with the giant flatbed with all the speakers, drums, and the mutant playing heavy metal guitar? I actually laughed out loud when it first came out and then groaned at this lame concept.

I wonder how different this would have been with Mel Gibson. Hardy did not convey the depth of character that Gibson did, and this was quickly reflected in the fact that he barely had any lines and just looked angry all the time. They brought back the V8 Interceptor, which was nice but broke from the fact that it was blown up in The Road Warrior.

When I read the reviews and bought the DVD I was expecting something like The Road Warrior, what I got was The Road Warrior for kids mashed into Beyond Thunderdome.

It was good for watching during a workout.

3/27/2017: I watched the special features and gained some insight into the thought process behind this movie. Although I understand where the vehicle designs came from in concept, I find it difficult to believe they would have created these monstrosities as a show of power, rather I believe they would have built more utilitarian vehicles better suited for the desert. Also Hardy touched on the fact that they were not looking to recreate the Max character, but go in a different direction, so I get the impression this is a Mad Max reboot. I wish they would have explained the visions that haunt Max, perhaps this will be touched on in the next movie.

It was interesting watching them work through the stunts to avoid having to use CGI. I figured the first crash of Max's Interceptor was remote, but there was an actual stunt man driving the car at the time.",1490140800,,1873,4.529585798816568

7224282,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I don't get awards, this is a shinny version of what Mad Max is or was..It didn't feel different. I missed the mad max car..it was part of who he was..It is hard to replace Mel Gibson in any roll even if Tom Hardy is an excellent actor. Well the first time I watch this I had a kidney store and was on pain killers..so I fell asleep..but I did buy it and watched it again and fell asleep..this is the second movie I  fell asleep to..the first being Lost Highways. Normally I don't sleep during movies. The look was good, the sound was just normal..the world itself must have been a good job for the costume designers and car designers..but the location was Dust..just Dust...lots of Dust..nothing interesting about dust..other than..I found out it makes me sleepy..My feeling is..they shouldn't have started with this..maybe this could have been the third movie.and this is where it ends..It didn't work for me as the first movie..",1489968000,,931,4.642424242424243

I got the edition with Black and Chrome included. I would watch the color version first, but the B&C is actually very compelling.

7224298,3,B00YQJRYGY,"We originally viewed this on a Sony 52"" LCD with the original Blu ray. We were very impressed with the alternative take on the source material - VERY creative.

Then... we upgraded our home theater to the awesome LG OLED65B6P monitor and the Panasonic DMP-UB900 4K UHD Blu ray player.
We double-dipped and purchased Mad Max Fury Road 4K UHD even though the reviewer at Ultrahd.hidefdigest.com warned about  of the 4K version and I quote:
'However, seeing as how the transfer comes from a lower resolution source, the 4K presentation also suffers from a few visible artifacts worth mentioning, most notably more than a few instances of mosquito noise that can be easily seen in the blue sky. Also, despite contrast looking pretty good, a majority of the video noticeably runs hot, so much so that large portions of the picture and several action sequences appear distractingly exaggerated. For the most part, the palette comes with some fairly vivid primaries and dazzling moments, but at the same time, those same colors come off much too intense and oversaturated. This is especially true of reds and its various shades, making explosions seem digital and cartoonish, and the scene with the massive tornado in the middle of the dust storm serves as a primary example of how bad the video can sometimes look, making the orange-yellowish explosions appear like blobs of red. Although shadows and the darkest portions of the screen show a marked improvement, many of the finer details are sadly engulfed by the levels of blackness, and we don't really see a great deal of variation between the various shades.'

All of the above were intentional by the director. Also, I observed that the film Editing also includes 'drop frame' editing that is frequently obvious throughout the whole film. I believe the director intended this 'technique' would appear to make the film more fidgety and create 'tension'.

Basically, this 4K UHD is fairly horrible and shows the cartoonish CGI flames and explosions for what they really are rather than blending them in. I did not see this theatrically but, I'm sure that, in the theater, these amateurishly embarrassing 'effects' would not have been noticed because of the 2-3 second editing nature, however, on 4K UHD it all shows up constantly and, sadly, I will probably never watch this movie again because of it.",1488672000,6,2349,4.969465648854962

7224309,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Extremely disappointed. With the exception of the obvious skill required to pull off many of the action sequences, I do not understand how this movie is so highly rated. Just like when I watched 300 and Battleship. Everyone told me how awesome this movie was so my expectations were very high when I finally bought it. What a gawd-awful mess of a movie. Someone once reviewed one of my books with ""the author goes on and on and on and on and on"" and that's how I feel about the entire first half of this movie. And this is from someone who loves 2001, Silent Running, Apocalypse Now Redux and numerous other 'slow' movies.

  From the cartoonish colorations of the explosions to the sped-up action sequences, this movie jarred my senses from beginning to end. I think perhaps it would have been a much better film had it been shot entirely in B&W, but it is hard to tell. Perhaps that is due to my pre-conception that post-apocalyptic movies should look more...bleak.

  The dialogue was minimal and what was there was atrocious throughout most of the film, but not in the intentionally stunted-learning ways of Thunderdome where there was a clear lack of education among those growing up after the great Apocyclips. Also, I think that if you decide to try and tell a movie with so little dialogue then the visuals should be deeper and subtly expressive, less jarring. A battle-axe was used where a scalpel was necessary, backhoe instead of shovel.

Although she did a great job with what she was given, even the incomparable Charlize Theron could not save many of the scenes of this movie. I was not terribly impressed with any of the other actors in this film, although I immediately recognized 'the Toecutter' when he showed, that was a nice surprise.

There were a lot of homages for the former movies thrown in and for that I almost gave it 3 stars, but I just feel too disappointed for that. I will say that the second half of the movie was better than the first, though I'm not sure exactly where the movie began to become tolerable. Perhaps I just became desensitized to the environment.

I always watch movies several times and edit my reviews, so it is possible to earn another star or two later. Maybe I was just in a bad mood when I saw this movie.",1487980800,,2260,4.560493827160494

7224318,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This review is for the Black & Chrome version only.  If you've already sampled clips via YouTube let it be known that shot by shot comparisons are one thing, witnessing the entire film in stark black and white is another.  Honestly the first time I watched the B&C (Black & Chrome) edition I thought it looked cool but I decided I liked the color version better since I knew it was originally shot to be in color and felt I was looking at an afterthought idea.  I was also analyzing shot composition constantly and not immersing myself into the film itself.  A few days later I decided to watch some of the B&C version again, then I put in the color disc in to compare and suddenly I realized I actually like the B&C version better.  Yes, even the director admitted some shots don't translate very well in black and white (especially the dark scenes at night) but what you gain with black and white is a complete different feel overall.  When I went back to the color version it felt more like a typical Hollywood blockbuster action film... when you watch the B&C version you feel like you're being drawn into another world... bleak, gritty and steampunk apocalyptic.  Sounds strange when we're talking about the same film with the same visuals, but believe me there is a perceptive difference.  I'm one of the suckers who bought the initial blu ray release when the first version was released, but fortunately the B&C edition is fairly priced and I have no regrets owning it in addition to the original.  The Black and Chrome edition is the version I'll watch more often.  What may seem like a gimmick is actually a masterful idea.  On a final note if you think they simply de-saturated the picture that's not the case.  Each shot was enhanced / reformatted with a true black and white representation.",1487635200,147,1802,4.596875
7224319,1,B00YQJRYGY,Worst movie I've seen in awhile. I don't know what all the fuss was about. The actor playing Mad Max was droll and barely spoke. It's all big vehicles racing across a desert with weapons and fire and nearly everybody dies. The minor hints at a feminist movement could have been better but I think a lot was probably lost in the editing.,1487548800,,336,4.349206349206349
7224320,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Well made, and a great balance between high-octane excitement, character development, and incredible storytelling.

7224330,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I have watched the original version of Fury Road several times, and each viewing I have been absolutely mesmerized by the visual imagery and editing.  I am also a photographer who shoots in black and white, almost exclusively.  So I came to the ""Black Chrome"" version of Fury Road with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed by the monochromatic version.  It's not that the Black Chrome version didn't provide great visual images, but the use of color in the original version was so masterfully done that its deletion lessened the overall visceral quality of the film's imagery.

That said, I'm glad that I watched the black and white version, and while I probably won't watch that disc too many times again, I still have a gorgeous Blu-Ray of the original for when the mood strikes.",1486857600,,805,4.846715328467154

I unfortunately did not see this film while in theaters but once it came out on DVD and digital I knew I had to buy it right away!  It was the best decision I made in movie choices this year! I have, since purchasing, watched this film over five times and that won't be the last.

Completely changes the visual aspect of the movie, it's stunningly detailed hi-def while almost making it look like one of the classics from the 30's and 40's cinema. The original Blu-ray was not worth buying for the premium until the black and chrome version was included. It must be said that after viewing both the upsampled DVD version on our screen along with the Blu-Ray, the native Blu-Ray version is miles better.

Doesn't get more extreme than that.  Oh wait yes it does.  This over the top Mad Max update makes the original films seem tepid and subdued in comparison.

7224498,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Please note I am watching this on a Samsung KS8000 series 55 SUHD TV through a Samsung UBDK8500 player. I am really only assessing the image as I have movies wired into my stereo as opposed to a home theater.

To buy or not to buy, that is the question  In this case take a pass, keep your standard blu ray, and save $25.

To begin with, I really enjoy the actual film. The three star review is for the 4k UHD blu ray specifically. While the film is a terrific example of compelling sci-fi action, the 4k UHD presentation is underwhelming and presents limited improvements over the standard blu ray. UHD 4k was minimally better with increased color intensity, although almost to the point where it feels artificially over-saturated if that makes any sense. The image sharpness enjoys a slight improvement over the standard blu ray. Close-up detail refinement seemed decent, but distance shots became extremely muddy and somewhat of a big blur of small movements. Overall its only a nominal (if-any) real improvement over the standard blu ray.

In short, do NOT use this to sell your friends on 4k. I happened to watch this immediately after watching the 2012 4k remaster of Lawrence of Arabia and the 4k UHD Mad Max was inferior in virtually every way. Save your money, keep your standard blu ray, and go buy the Lawrence of Arabia 4k remaster (which can be obtained at a great price) to actually get an extraordinary ultra-high-def experience that can sell your friends (and you) on 4k. THAT movie knocks it out of the park as an example of all that 4k can be. On the other hand the Max Max Fury Road 4k UHD presentation is probably a hard-hit single at best.",1481587200,,1660,4.579124579124579

7224513,3,B00YQJRYGY,"In order for somebody to enjoy this film, you would have to suspend all belief in reality. That alone would suggest that ""Fury Road"" was targeted at a specific younger audience. The plotline of ""Fury Road"" would make for a good five-minute short, which means that the maine body of the film is 115 minutes of vehicles racing through the desert, vehicles crashing, vehicles blowing up, and so on, ad nauseum.  The only reason I didn't give this film one star is because:  1. Fury Road was true to the original Mad Max series. 2.  The cinematography was outstanding.  3.  The music was also good.  4.  Both the acting and the casting were very good.

Fury Road has a lot of things going for it, but plotline and character development aren't among them.  This was a film that wasn't made for the same crowd that would watch PBS Masterpiece Theatre, but even so, this could have been a much richer film experience.",1481328000,,910,4.567901234567901

7224515,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a very well made movie. I had a blast watching it. And what makes this movie different from others, is the fact that there's barely no dialogue between the characters, this in comparison to your typical hollywoood action movie. In the case of Mad Max, all the action packed in the movie, tells the story, and that's enough to make it good. This was one of the best movies of 2015, and its 6 Oscars are the evidence.

Both cuts are masterful but this one amplifies the bleak, hopelessness of this post apocalyptic world. The details of some scenes are so much sharper and I can't help but wonder if that is so because I'm color blind.

Having said that, I believe this is one of the best films of the last several years.  Certainly the best adventure/chase film made this century.  Every shot makes sense within the whole - you won't get lost during the fight scenes.  Director Miller used live-action extensively, and it shows.  There are some mostly-CGI scenes and one of them is brilliant beyond comparison.  ""Oh, what a day!  What a lovely day"" is the standout line that follows it.

I really cannot understand the enthusiasm shown by some cinema critics. Good effects, spectacular crashes? Yeah, but I couldn't care and I had to force myself to finish the film.

films are the chases, class struggles and crazies vs what passes for normal in a very abnormal world.  Fantastic transformation for actress Charlize Theron into crew cut, grease smeared rebel and hero.

7224591,1,B00YQJRYGY,"I was utterly disappointed in this movie. Man talk about running out of ideas and resorting to political correctness to cover the fact a great series was sold out to social engineering. I couldn't watch the whole thing. It was just too freaking artificial and repetitious; besides the other three Mad Max had the same stunts. Where was the insanity that is Max himself. Max is the heart and soul of Mad Max not some politically correct socially engineered BS.
The title is false advertising. I am surprised Hardy put up with the emasculation of Max. So, Hardy, I appreciated you as an actor but no more.
Miller was done years ago. Now he has tarnished his own legacy.",1478131200,,667,4.61344537815126

7224599,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Ten Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture) and six wins, this film is a triumph of practical effects over CGI-created monstrosities. All of the crazy vehicles in the film were actually designed, built, and completely functional. They WORK, and all the vehicular thrills are more spectacularly weighty and believable as a result. The actors? They are also real, and they work, too, with performances suitably as gritty and barren as the film's duochromatic landscape.

Boneheads will dismiss this as a ""two-hour car chase,"" which isn't false. But it IS about as observant as saying Citizen Cane is ""a movie about a man.""

This is the most high-octane, spectacularly filmed, produced, and directed car chase that you will have ever seen. It may never be toppedbut I hope Geoge Martin and his pals try.",1477872000,,811,5.090225563909774

Mad Max, The Road Warrior and even Thunder Dome were really good - made better by how spare the scenes and clipped the scenes were.  This thing was over done, over engineered, over special FXd, over everything.  The actors did the best they could with what they had, but what they had was terrible.

7224613,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This packaging is actually pretty cool. I love the model car and the 3D version of the movie looks great. As for the film, this one is really an exercise in flash over substance in every sense. Even the critics' reviews and award nominations bear out that this movie is a real technical marvel, but it had little to offer in terms of acting, character development or plot twists.

Though predictable and at times the action sequences seemed to go on forever, this is a fun movie if you like action. If you don't like action or if you are looking for a good sci-fi/fantasy film, you are likely to be disappointed.",1477353600,,612,4.464285714285714

It moves from minute one and does not stop until the end.

As an action movie I loved it but in no way does it touch road warrior or thunderdome. Fury road was just way to over the top for me and I'm sorry but there's no way that those cars would have kept running on a normal sized fuel tank, like give me a break. A man hanging from chains in front of enough speakers to put on a metallic concert while playing guitar...does that even sounds plausible? You better have an amazing rig of batteries to support that much power and let's not forget that somehow with this giant sail of half stacks they're able to drive through a sandstorm while dodging tornados...cause that makes sense. Way over blown. I could keep going but I think you got the idea.

This movie is so different from the others, in such a good way. It has that post apocolyptic theme and takes it on a different path than most other movies that try. There is a different ""feel"" about this movie that truly separates it from the pack. Great action sequences, while not overdoing it. Good characters, without getting overly involved with their stories. Awesome effects without making it look fake. Now I await with great anticipation for more!!

Not only is the movie fantastic, but the special features go behind the camera as the we get to see how the movie was made.  Though the movie lacked a compelling plot, the action is exquisitely chaotic, giving the audience nonstop adrenaline.  Not only do I think its an incredible movie, but the critics do as well.  Receiving a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, it also became one of the few action movies to win an Oscar, winning six from ten nominations.  Mad Max: Fury Road is an absolute must buy for anyone.",1475712000,,787,4.625899280575539

7224689,1,B00YQJRYGY,"It's hard to believe that the same talented director who made the influential cult action classic The Road Warrior had anything to do with this disaster.
Road Warrior was raw, gritty, violent and uncompromising, and this movie is the exact opposite. It's like Road Warrior for kids who need constant action in their movies.
This is the movie. The good guys get into a fight with the bad guys, outrun them, they break down in their vehicle and fix it. Rinse and repeat. The second half of the movie is the first half again just done faster.
The Road Warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel something, even with it's opening narration before any action was even shown. And the supporting characters were given just enough time for each of them to be likable or relatable.
In this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about. We're supposed to care about the characters because... well we should. George Miller just wants us to, and in one of the most cringe worthy moments Charlize Theron's character breaks down while dramatic music plays to try desperately to make us care.
Tom Hardy is pathetic as Max. One of the dullest leading men I've seen in a long time. There's not one single moment throughout the entire movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma Mel Gibson did in the role. Gibson made more of an impression just eating a tin of dog food. I'm still confused as to what accent Hardy was even trying to do.
I was amazed that Max has now become a cartoon character as well. Gibson's Max was a semi-realistic tough guy who hurt, bled, and nearly died several times. Now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with ease?
In the previous movies, fuel and guns and bullets were rare. Not anymore. It doesn't even seem Post-Apocalyptic. There's no sense of desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking. And the main villain's super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as Hardy's Australian accent is. They're so boring and one-dimensional, George Miller could have combined them all into one character and you wouldn't miss anyone.
Some of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking, and the CGI sandstorm is laughably bad. It wouldn't look out of place in a Pixar movie.
There's no tension, no real struggle, or any real dirt and grit that Road Warrior had. Everything George Miller got right with that masterpiece he gets completely wrong here.",1474243200,3,2486,4.7304147465437785

The reverence for breastmilk was refreshingly affirming, and the implication of oppression in pumping at the behest of a patriarchal power was on point.

Furiosa is amazing, of course, but she is just one of many powerful, well-developed, compelling female characters.  This film is a gritty, dark, and sometimes very challenging piece of art, but one that I heartily recommend to feminists and femmefolk especially.  Equal parts a film about strong female characters and a scathing indictment of a hauntingly familiar misogynist dystopia.",1472947200,,691,5.254545454545455

7224767,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the sort of fascinatingly original movie-going experience that rarely comes from an existing franchise. And when it comes to part 4s in all of cinema, I cant think of one Ive ever liked more. George Miller, who directed the series other three entries, is back to do the job again here almost 30 years after the last one, and he proves to be cinematically as sharp as ever.  The fine accomplishments of actors and all the technical people notwithstanding, this is a directors film more than anything, with a sweeping vision of a post-apocalyptic world that, however crazy it gets, sells itself all the way through. You don't question what you seeyou feel you are there.

It stars Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, and Tom Hardy as Mad Maxthats in order of importance. Max is a good character, the continued tortured soul trying survive, and yet finding the humanity in himself; but with all respect Furiosa is the real soul of this movie, the best performance (Id put it Therons best character since her Oscar winning turn in Monster) a woman strong, cunning and skilled, yet also at points vulnerable, as she leads a troop of wives away from their powerful, malicious husband who chases them basically from one end of the movie to the other. Max gets caught up with them along the way, in an interesting evolving relation towards Furiosa and the wives. These wives, five of them, don't get a lot of lines, but the qualities they bring in something different from both Max and Furiosa is important to the films success. Vital too are the host of villains, who come in such variety of interesting dark flavors, from the head evil master, down the hierarchy of his lower-ranked cohorts, to the followers convinced of the glory of self-sacrifice for their leader.

This movie is marvelously thick with post-apocalyptic atmosphere. It is also thrilling, and so varied with every action or chase sequence that rolls brilliantly off of the previous one. There are moments of slowdown, so to speak, where there is verbal interaction more than a couple words at a time, but as far as character building theres as much during the action as in the less hectic times. This is a constantly surprising, original film, frequently exciting, sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and absolutely never for any minute stretch uninteresting. The technical expertise to create such wild, high-flying (figuratively and literally) things as are shown here is just mind-boggling, but creativity is where it really excels. Its one captivating experience, not quite like anything else thats been made before. It must be seen.

The Blu-Ray transfer looks great, and it sounds even better than how it looks. There a fair deal of documentary extras that offer insights into this breathtaking work.",1472342400,,2793,4.9361702127659575

7224769,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Wow. This movie is one wild ride. Fantastically fun all from start to finish. An all out entertaining, exciting, well put together and filmed thrill ride. The audio and video quality on this disc is outstanding. LFE hits hard, crashes and explosions pack a wallop but never collapses into a mess of sound. Everything is distinct and clean even at hight volume levels (- 5 db) which is how I like to watch most movies but the quiet dialog moments are just that, quiet and peaceful with great clarity in the voices so there seems to be very high dynamic range here also. No problems clearly hearing any characters through the din of the mayhem going on for a lot of the film and the surrounds are very active throughout providing great atmospherics and impact. The story is pretty good, if not absolutely outstanding for this type of movie and it gives enough of an excuse to just let yourself go, enjoy the movie for what it is and to suspend disbelief during the run time to just have a blast. Its been too long since Ive had that much fun watching an action movie. Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy really pull these characters off also.",1472342400,,1134,4.509708737864078

The ability to have one of your favorite movies in each format allows for us to watch the Blu-ray at home, bring the DVD to friends and Grandma's house and watch with others and for my Son to use the digital version to watch on his phone or tablet.
  If picking only one format, my preference is for the Blu-ray.  It is amazing how clear the same movie is when seen on Blu-ray vs. DVD.  Also there are usually extra content present on the Blu-ray that is not available on the DVD.
  As far as the movie itself.  A Mad Max fan will love this movie.  It does not disappoint viewers by keeping the action going constantly.  The movie is rated R and not for young kids.  I would say that the main reason it is rated R is the violence, but this is an action movie and it is expected.  There is a scene with a woman naked in a cage as bait and another with breast feeding women hooked up to a milking machine.  That said, I felt comfortable letting my high school teenagers watch this movie.",1470182400,2,1080,4.209756097560976

The story line revolves around the female cast of characters and Tom hardy almost takes a back seat. Never fear! Like I said, it's still a guy flick as well as a chick flick.

7224938,1,B00YQJRYGY,"The character of Mad Max was utterly destroyed for this movie so that it could be butchered into a politically correct chick flick.  As one disgusted character accurately scoffed in the movie, ""All this over a family squabble"".

But let's get to the real issue:  A defeated, muzzled (literally), and irrelevant Max has been dumbed-down to a 3-word vocabulary and thrown into the background so Charlize Theron could go butch and take the lead. Oh, and Max's black police interceptor that is the only reason for any true Mad Max fan to want to watch this movie? The one in the trailer and the one on the movie poster?  Destroyed in the opening scene.  The rest of the movie is just a predictable video game.  Speaking of which...

This movie is an obvious rlp-0ff of the video game called ""Rage"", by iD/Bethesda Software, which was released 4 years earlier - just enough time to write a rip-script and complete production. We're talking rip-off all the way down to the freak vehicle warfare, to the rogue motor gangs you have to cut deals with, to the epic canyon ambushes, to the half-zombie pale cult villain dudes. Yeah - it's that shameless. We're talking ""J.K. Rowling shamelessly ripping off 'Troll'(1986 American movie about a boy wizard named Harry Potter) and not even changing Harry Potter's name before making billions"" shameless.

Do I have anything good to say about the movie?  Sure - excellent special effects and visuals.  That's a given in this century.

Yeah, I know - you wanna cry about my review because your generation has no clue what the Mad Max franchise is all about.  That's ok - there, there.  Here's a bucket of ice cream, a hand trowel, a warm blanket, and your cell phone with Facebook all loaded up, while mommy puts a copy of Disney's ""Frozen"" in for you.

In the mean time, my review is accurate no matter how you try to spin it - the bottom line is that Max was dumbed down and thrown into a background sub-plot so they could neuter this shameless video game rip-off into a chick flick.  Even the movie itself acknowledges this.",1468281600,35,2061,4.639118457300276

I am a huge fan of the original Road Warrior movie from 1982.  I think the story in this new version is overall a little weak and could have been better thought out.  The 'guitar guy' thing was a little odd to me, but not a deal-breaker for liking the film.

I have to confess that for me the addition of Charlize Theron to the cast automatically elevated the movie to a higher level than it might have been without her. It also helped that Max was portrayed by anyone other than Mel Gibson,  although I thought Tom Hardy did a very credible job of presenting a Max haunted by his past failures. The only downside to me was the absolute over the top designs of the war machines. I mean,  c'mon,  a guitarist shredding while dangling in front of the speaker laden grillwork of a monter truck.

They get a chick-flick. Next, remember the tanker chase scene in Road Warrior? It was a great part of the movie. Note the word ""part"".  It did not last for 2 hours. This entire film is one big tanker chase scene with the good guys ending right back where they started minus one bad guy and his crew. Totally boring. This film should not be part of the Max Max series. It should have been titles something else. The mad max franchise is ruined.

Mad max only in name.  I feel this diverges from the spirit of the original.

If you enjoyed the original mad max for it's story line, interesting characters, and action scenes that actually built up to the point where they were exciting this version misses those entirely.

However, this movie suffered from ""you go gurrrl"" syndrome. Men did not ""destroy the world"", we built it. If men disappeared tomorrow, the world would collapse because everything is still built and repaired by men - are the women going to suddenly train millions to do the dirty dangerous jobs? So we are going to completely suspend disbelief, that a dictator who has thousands of warriors, and believe that a one armed ""waif"" is chosen to drive a war machine? Are we supposed to believe a bunch of elderly women are riding gigantic motorcyles, wielding guns heavier than them, and not getting killed by bandits? Oh sure, you don't need no man, except to fix your truck in the middle of the desert.

7225074,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I aim this review at people who are fans of the franchise but haven't warmed up to Fury Road or a new Max. Perhaps this Max is an imitation by someone who was once enamored with him. If Max was a shell of a man, perhaps someone could climb into that shell and never look back? After a 30 year nap, its hard to be objective about a character Ive missed so dearly. That said, don't try to analyze what year Fury Road takes place. A few years from now is the smart way to never paint your future into a corner. A new man in the lead opens the doors to more possibilities. George is consistent in his delivery even with improvisations.

The way George Miller depicts death is not to show it in graphic detail as it happens. In fact, the recently deceased are never shown again later. The perspective is forward moving and if you end up between his wheels, Max doesnt look back either. You also catch glimpses of physical deformities and handicaps but George doesnt linger on that either. He wants to show you a world where its tough to get by and the faster you get by, the more likely it is youll live another day.

Every character in the franchise is dressed like a cartoon character. For Fury Road, the outfits and dialects are in high gear. The desert trench battle sequences look like they were shot by George Lucas. Tusken Raiders on motorcycles with a Rastafarian influence. Where it seems most evident that this is indeed beyond"" Thunderdome is the fighting styles. This style of combat is vertical. Cirque du Soleil on wheels. Taller vehicles. Taking to the air via pole vaulting acrobatics youve not seen before.

When describing the new movie to friends, I offer that the hand to hand fight sequences have the best choreography Ive ever seen. The chase is like Act three of the Road Warrior extended for the full duration. I was excited to see Charlize Theron (Furiosa) behind the wheel because of The Italian Job. Furiosa is as important to this story as Max is. Fury Road also shows Max on a motorcycle for the first time. The new villain (Immortan Joe) is similar to Thunderdomes Auntie Entity though Joe lives in less of an underworld, in fact he lives high above it. Sort of a hot rod factory inside the base of a mountain with his palace on top. Joe actually controls a giant dam-like spigot to provide (sometimes) water to the homeless. In this movie, every type of fluid is a valuable. This includes gas (someone is still refining oil), water, mothers milk (oh!) and even Type O positive blood makes Max an attractive person to capture alive as a universal donor.

We love Max because there's nobody more resourceful in terms of risk versus reward. The fastest car burns the most fuel. On cable and VHS releases of the first Max movie, I had no idea the nickname painted on his first car was The Dark One. It would have been great to know that before this story got rolling. It explains a lot. Gasoline is what got Max in trouble but mobility is how Max survives. We don't know what keeps Max motivated. He runs from the bad guys, tries to barter with the good guys and the tension throughout is this: Who IS good anymore? Max remains an anti-social, reluctant hero who has contributed the same wisdom in two movies now: staying put may offer the best chance to live comfortably. But wheres the fun in that?

The bluray has extra content that I found to be satisfying. On a typical DVD, theres a handful of featurettes assembled from the same cuts which feels repetitive. These extras are better than average.

I like a good commentary track but not every creative mind is the life of the party. George did a commentary for the Road Warrior but it was a bit dry. I recently watched The Madness of Max via the Amazon Firestick and it was a more than two hours of interviews with many people from the cast (including a lot of Mel Gibson) and crew of the original Mad Max. I felt that was a better value than buying the Shout Factory version of Mad Max (blu-ray) to get the Mel Gibson interview.",1465084800,,4007,4.452316076294278

The live-time action sequences are so good that you have to tip your hat to the stuntmen for sacking-up and putting it on the line. CGI effects are an added bonus for the unbelievable.

Two things I just couldn't get past were the sped up fight scenes and Tom Hardy. I can't handle him I just can't I've seen him in Bronson, The Dark Knight Rises and now this and think he's just a really hammy over-actor. Charlize Theron was outstanding and I appreciated how the movie was more centred around her and Hugh Keays-Byrne was good as Immortan Joe.

 I don't know I think I just would've liked to have seen the post apocalyptic settings explored a bit more rather than that just serving as a backdrop to essentially a drag race with fighting.",1463702400,,661,4.409836065573771

The main storyline was there, it just lacked the lead in, which is crucial to making the audience understand and believe the dedesperation and loneliness Max lives in.  The ending also was very leading to the next chapter, whereas the franchise was built on Max heading out into the unknown with no expectations.

Also the filming seem to lack the grainy footage and the bazzar speed or fast forwarding.  The post apocalyptic setting.  Again, a basic of the franchise.",1463529600,,533,4.75

7225266,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Well done, but often gratuitous effects. This movie is a one trick pony.  The writing and dialogue are terrible. Also, the casting is quite shoddy, especially the casting of the villain's ""breeders"", his wives. Why they had to cast a half dozen models who could barely act (and that's being generous) for those roles showed that this movie was all gloss, no substance. So pointless, I had to take a break half way through the movie and watched the rest only for amusement, knowing it would be lame.",1461542400,12,498,4.659090909090909

Theron brings the character Furiosa into the limelight as yet another great female hero. Tom Hardy as Mad Max was inspiring. Both actors made it hard to believe that this was a fictional take on a post-apocalyptic world. I know one thing, if this world ever comes to be, I know who I would want fighting by my side.

I found this movie to be both brutal and yet comedic at times. I found all the characters were cast well. Though there were a few scenes that made me gag slightly all in all it was a damn good movie. I would highly recommend to any one who has not yet seen this movie, watch it. You will not be disappointed

7225333,1,B00YQJRYGY,"The villains are ridiculous. Drummers, a guitarist. The main bad guy is a fat old man! You get to see his disgusting old body, UP CLOSE.  There are lots of ugly old men here. Of course, each one gives you a good look at their fat, disgusting and diseased body. First they take their clothes off, then they come right up to you.  When I saw him that close I let out a groan of revulsion. They stick it in your face. They rub it in. I felt my stomach flip over. My eyes are wild, I'm moving and squirming in my seat, trying to get away.  They show it off.  I can't get away from it.  I wanted to cry "" I can't take this anymore!""
  There is a pack of old ladies. They've got a lot of rage. They kill every man they see. The old women kill men with enthusiasm. They get a lot of satisfaction out of it.  If you like seeing old women kill men you'll love it.  In a post apocalyptic world without supplies... everyone has unlimited guns, ammo and gas.  The fat mans cult of warboys have removable steering wheels. They put them in a shrine to worship. The warboys run out of blood in their bodies and need to be filled up with blood from human victims like Max. In the middle of the wasteland there are men that dress up like birds and walk on stilts for no reason. A small woman with a angry face and one arm dominates everyone.  Everyone's afraid of her.  A old man is blind. They give him machine guns and put him in charge.  In an embarrassing public display he stands up, raises his arms to the sky and screams to the effect "" I am the greatest killer that lived!!""  Nobody argues. Then he fires wildly screaming like a madman. He's totally out of control and nobody can stop him. He becomes their best sharpshooter.  A woman spits in a mans face and kicks him out of a truck.  He has a hurt and confused look on his face.  I think I had the same look on my face when I saw it. The fat mans cult is painted white for no reason. They all carry silver spray paint and like to spray it into their open mouths. They like to wrap their lips around hoses and suck gasoline. The ' bad guy' leader doesn't really want to rule the wasteland... He only wants babies!
  Villains are made to look weak and pathetic.  One villain is a big man with a lot of muscle.  He encounters a midget the size of a baby.  He outweighs the midget by 200 pounds.  The midget motions the big man close, then grabs his face and pushes it back, telling him to get lost. The big man responds by running away with a scared and confused look on his face.  Later the big man lifts a heavy engine over his head, but he doesn't know what to do with it.  I felt sorry for him, he was supposed to be bad..  Another 'bad guy' decides not to fight the enemy.  He only hisses at them.  The enemy hits him in the face.  He can only hiss and is quickly knocked out.
  I was bored and frustrated because the film centered around Charlize and not Max.  The vehicles are too over the top, enormous and silly to be believable in this sort of gas starved world. Silly cars include: 3 cars welded together, a car the same size and shape as a 3 story building and a porcupine car with a hundred spikes sticking out of it. It would be really embarrassing and humiliating to be seen driving these circus show style cars.
  My hero, Max, is tortured in the first half, then Charlize beats him, turns him into her slave and calls him a fool. The man was stretched out with bloody tattoos all over his body. Then they tied him to the front of a vehicle and just left him out to die. He had a cage on his face for half the film.  They kept Max in a cage. I wanted Max to get the bastards that did this to him.  He never does.  His master Charlize does. Charlize keeps her slave, Max, on a short, tight leash. He's barely allowed to drive. I thought she was going to grind his face into the dirt under her boot.  Max is reduced to the level of a subhuman pig, only fit to lick Charlize's boots.  He isn't allowed to have his interceptor or have a dog.
  Charlize Theron, known for her beauty, decides to cut her hair buzzcut short so instead of being beautiful she looks like a vicious terrier or a natzi. Charlize emasculates and neuters Max. He spends most of his time in a cage or with his face on the floor while she does the driving. I thought ' This is bloody degrading!  How much lower can he go?'  I fell off my seat when I saw Max unable to even fire a gun and hand it over to her.
  The 'warlord' never does anything bad or brutal, never flexes any muscle, only his belly. He's always complaining about not having a woman and a baby, making himself look needy, desperate and pathetic. Tina Turner instilled more fear in 'Mad Max beyond thunderdome'.  In a long scene he decides to give his people some water. The crowd of starving, toothless people wait eagerly. 'Finally..water' they croak as they lick their bleeding gums. He pours the water into the sand. Now they have nothing to drink! The crowd goes wild! They love it!  The toothless crowd dances for a long time.
  In a big scene a war boy throws his body on the spikes of the porcupine car after only being hit by an arrow in the arm. His buddies cheer and egg him on ' Do it!  Do it!'  After he died no one even showed any emotion over the loss. No anger, no sorrow, no lust for revenge, no nothing. I didn't even get to see him land on the spikes, quiver and die. He blew himself up before he touched the spikes. The warboys all carry stick bombs so if you want to die and blow yourself up, you jump on your stick. Other films have great action scenes, here there are only explosions blowing up people you know nothing about and care nothing about and old women shooting men in the head. There are explosions everywhere. Boom. boom! BOOM!  Did someone die? I think so, there was an explosion. How did he die? I don't know, all I saw was a bright light.
  I wanted to see the obnoxious screaming old man with the 2 machine guns die in the worst way- and I didn't get to see it! All you see is a tiny explosion in the distance. You don't even get to see what happened.
  I spent $14 on this dvd. I saw it with some friends. When we saw how bad it was we talked nothing about it. I thought "" No! This cannot happen to Max."" It was like watching my best friend die. Watching the movie, I think I suffered as much as Max.  When it was over there was only one thing to do.  We buried it.  Very deep.  Then I cried.  I cried for Max.  Now, even though its buried and gone, the images of Max's torture will never leave my mind.  They will burn forever in my memory, never to be removed.
  I still have the nightmare.  I still cry.  I've had it for half a year.  I'll have it 10 years from now.
I see myself in the nightmare.  I see myself tied to the front of the vehicle.  I see myself in the same circumstances as Max, where I have to suffer as he did.  I can't see the face of the person driving.  I'm crying and pleading for them to let me down, to cancel my suffering.  I'm crying  ""Don't let me die.""  I ask them to let me down.  I ask over and over.  They won't let me down.  I wake up.  Every time.

Certainly not what I was looking for....... I like, er....... plot, good writing, good dialogue..... So its a HIT or a MISS, for me it was a MISS.",1460419200,12,321,4.3
7225336,2,B00YQJRYGY,"HORRIBLY flawed film.....
While I cannot say the movie is a total turd, I do have to admit it STINKS in many ways... First of all, while it does have an internal logic, it just does not make any sense given the particulars of plot and so forth. First up- Immortan Joe's Valhalla Cult. Great concept. Great execution. Just one problem- it would take a minimum of two generations (forty years) to produce such a cult. Dedicated true beleivers like in the film are not gonna exist just a few years after the Apocalypse, any more than the whole Barbaric culture of Joe's little tribe out there in the wastelands.
Lord Humungous in Road Warrior was more beleivable- after all, he was just the vicious leader of a pack of criminals and wild nutjobs.... But Joe's Cult is something very different....
None of these Warboys seem to have any knowledge of any other religion or lifestyle other than Joe's warped version of Odinism with himself at the top... For this to be these kids would have had to have been raised with no reference to Judaism, Christianity or Islam... That would be a veritable impossibility in the time frame the movie posits.
Becuase in order for Max to have been Tom Hardy's age, Joe had to have created this barbaric civilization in about 8 or 9 years tops!  So unless Max was about ten years old when the events taking place in the original Mad Max went down, there is just no way it could exist!
I like Tom Hardy- but this film would have made a lot more sense with either Mel Gibson in the part or some other actor south of 50.
Another problem with the film is that there are things in it that are just not explained. The little girl whose ghost or memory keeps haunting Max...
If you recall, in Mad Max, Max's child who is killed by Toe Cutter's biker band was a little boy- not a little girl!
You are given no explanation as to who this child is- in the film that is...
You have to purchase a graphic novel or comic book prequel to find out the child is one that Max had rescued once upon a time who died later...
(That story would have made a much better picture than this horrid mess!)
Finally you have the fact that Mad Max is not even the main character in the film. He's a co-star at best. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the main character in Fury Road. Max is just along for the ride. Given the problems with internal consistancy and missing peices of the puzzle, quite frankly Miller would have been a lot better off just saying Tom Hardy's character was the son of the original Mad Max, not the same character from the first three films at all. ...
Don't even get me started on the gawd-awful segments of the film that director Miller sped up- it makes the film look -quite frankly- stupid- like an ole timey Keystone Cops movie.
Now- there is some good stuff in the film. The young actor who plays Nix is EXCELLENT. Last time I was so impressed by a young actor was when I saw some kid named Leonardo Dicaprio in a movie. Here is hoping he goes on to bigger and better things....
Joe's tribe of weirdos out there in the desert is sort of interesting too- but there is just no way they could have developed in even 18 years time from the events in the first Mad Max. It just doesn't wash.....
And the stunt work is INCREDIBLE...If you are sick of CGI being overused and abused its a joy to see traditioanal stunts again on the big screen or small.
Poor Tom Hardy does a good job with the limited dialogue and screen time he is given. It would have been nice to have had more of him in what should have been his own movie.
This film is a mess that could truly have been salvaged. Too bad it wasn't.",1460419200,2,3624,4.313782991202346
7225337,4,B00YQJRYGY,"You know when you watch a movie like this, you are in it for the killer action/stunt scenes and great violence and this movie doesn't disappoint on that. Im a big fan of the original with Gibson, and think his character as max will always be the best. But Fury Road does take it to another level with bigger, wilder, more insane action, crazy over the top intense scenes.

7225343,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is the movie I'd been waiting for since The Road Warrior.

The first Mad Max was just a messy trainwreck of laughably bad special effects--yes I know they had a teeny tiny pathetic budget and they worked wonders with what little they had--bad acting at times, and just general horribleness.

The Road Warrior changed all of that and was the most fun I've had watching a post apocalyptic movie in a long time.

Fury Road completely blew me away.  It doesn't feature the most brilliant storytelling I've ever seen, even considering that it's a ""loud and proud violent assault on the senses"" type over-the-top action flick.  But the story it does tell speaks to me, and the characters--the ones that really matter--are brilliantly depicted by the cast.  That they were able to capture my heart so strongly in the brief and few respites between delightfully ridiculous action sequences--with so few words spoken at times--speaks to their talent.

Themes explored, among other things, include the hopelessness and self-perpetuation of war, out of control patriarchy and indoctrination, sexism/rape, slavery, greed/scarcity, and probably a dozen other themes that are over my head.  Oh, they also blow s*** up.  A lot.

This movie could have been simply titled Furiosa.  Charlize Theron completely stole the show, and I'm totally okay with it.  Her character took my breath away the way Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight did, if for different reasons and in a different way.

Hardy's softspoken, damaged Max is both heartbreaking and somehow encouraging, that he can still find room in his heart for empathy despite all the terrible suffering you can see he's endured.

And Nux.  Oh, Nux, you insane, noble, lunatic.

If you want to see an improved, better version of the original Mad Max movie, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to watch Mad Max fit into the social-justice, feminist cliche that most movies are becoming, then it is perfect.

Furiosa is the hero, not Mad Max.  Have fun watching her singlyhandedly defeat all of the pathetic males who dare challenge her.  The good biker gang is a all-female group of grandmothers, who also defeat all of the evil men.  The overwhelming majority of the men in Mad Max are evil rapists, except for white knight feminist Mad Max.

I could look past all of the social justice themes if the movie was actually good.  My wife watched it with me. She was also in shock that this was the same movie that has been lauded by critics and has had glory thrust upon it.  The movie was VERY predictable, the action was boring, the special effects were mediocre.

We realized that original viewing in the theater had just caught us off guard, because we finally had been 'affected' by a movie - not due to vulgarity, raw violence, or implausibly lazy plot twists or teen absurdity - but real film art, with exposed nerves, and depth that lets you bury yourself in the story and ignore reality floating above.

My best advice is to watch this on the biggest screen you can with surround sound speakers. It is a cinematographic masterpiece. Fun facts- the guitar that shoots flames is a real guitar that really shoots flames....the people on the ends of the poles in the chase scene really did that- they were cirque du soliel acrobats!

Charlize Theron was great and played an Ellen Ripley type character. But this movie was about water and not about gas. After trying to find the green land an escapeing.

7225470,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I had never seen any of the Mad Max movies. What got me interested in this one was that when the costume designer won an Oscar, she dressed like a character from the movie when she went to the awards. The tuxedoed men watching her walk up the aisle to get her Oscar, sneered with looks of disgust at her attire. So I looked up the trailers and watched a video of how they made the movie. It was made in Africa and they used former acrobats from Cirque du Solieil for stunts such as the pole riders and they used stunt motorcycle riders, and so on. They showed how the scenes were first drawn up on whiteboard in a comic book style and then brought to life. They discussed how they did different stunts. And they talked about how much fun they had making the movie. That is why I bought it.
I found it a little hard to follow. I am not sure if that was because I wasn't paying close enough attention or if the viewer was expected to already be familiar with the main characters.
It was very much like an opera, in a Les Miserables sort of way. I could almost see it as a stage play of the type where the opera singer carrying a spear and wearing a horned headdress, sings.
The plot was simple, this woman ran away with this warlord's wives, for some reason, and he chased after her to get them back. He, in turn, was chased by another warlord for invading his territory. It was mixed with loads of religious symbolism as well. The warlord was also the high priest, whose mere glance blessed his followers.
Max was incidental to the story. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and got caught up in it against his will.
It may seem at first glance that it is somewhat excessive, but when you consider what groups like ISIS are doing right now, it is not so outre.",1457827200,,1772,4.19941348973607
7225471,3,B00YQJRYGY,"MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (2015)  is an overly busy-busy-busy-busy science fiction action film with hundreds of very unbelievable (in the literal sense) battle scenes that involve close calls, injuries, and deaths . . . but with FAR too little conversation and character development.

Max is played this time by Tom Hardy, but the main focus in the film is on Furiosa, a tough woman with a prosthetic arm, played by Charlize Theron.

SPOILER ALERT: What partly redeems this sequel to THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981) and the other Mad Max films of Mel Gibson are the scenes in which tough women--young, middle-aged, and even elderly--battle the insane, violent patriarchy . . . and WIN.

Of course every feminist--both female and male--will recognize the parallels between the ""world"" of this film and our own unjust world. Very probably some viewers will find the unbelievable victory in this film a stirring and inspiring fantasy.

1 star is for the creators who made an attempt to not overuse CGI which was refreshing. Some decent real action stunts in this flick.

7225562,5,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is 70-year-old Australian George Miller's magnum opus, and the crowning achievement of his ""Mad Max"" saga which previously comprised three earlier films made between 1979 and 1985 with Mel Gibson playing the lead.  The first two, ""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" were rather cheap independent films that built a cult; the third one, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" was a misguided expensive film that aimed but failed to do what ""Fury Road"" succeeds at.  This one is a totally mad adrenaline-rush of an action film that will not only leave one breathless by its over-the-top stunt-filled explosive sequences, but, whether a fan of the older films or not, viewers should be blown right out of their seats in awe at the poetically-perfect execution of its filmmaking brilliance.

But what makes it even more special, and what truly earns it the masterpiece epithet, is the creation of the richest and most memorable female action character since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa.  Standing statuesque and sporting one metallic arm, she is a macho man's wet dream of an amazon warrior, but underneath her fierce exterior is a sensitive woman with a heart that beats with compassion.  What's more, she is the film's true protagonist, and leaves the character of Mad Max (played this time by Tom Hardy) as a second fiddle.  Half way through the drama it should be apparent to most viewers that this movie, purportedly a violent, super-action testosteronic spectacle displaying more snarling body-painted warriors and explosive pyrotechnics than a Hell's Angels' nightmare, is actually a hyperbolized portrait of an independent woman's rebellion from a male-dominated world.  In that sense, Miller has created a Trojan horse that puts down the very values it pretends to espouse, and helping to confirm this is a little-known fact that Eve Ensler (writer of ""The Vagina Monologues"") was consulted in the film's portrayal of its female characters.  What's more, every aspect of this film, from its film editing, production design, costumes, sound editing & mixing, is on a par with the greatest action films of all time.  But, believe me, this is not just for violent action fans -- it's for every one who loves great filmmaking.",1457049600,,2283,5.099195710455764

It is one of those films that not only has plenty of action packed moments, stunning visuals, but it is also a very well made film from start to finish.

7225601,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Spectacular stunts in the gorgeous Namibian setting can't make up for the lack of tension and lack of character development so notably missing from the script.  Charlese Theron is marvelous but Tom Hardy, though he does what he can, is no Mel Gibson, who back in the day , was an Uber cool, ironic, lean killing machine with a heart of gold.
Fury Road is like the last sequence of Road Warrior on steriods, and visually spectacular,  but in the end I was indifferent to everyone's fate, where as in Road Warrior, though I've probably watched it yearly since it came out, I hang on to the edge of my chair each time, rooting for all those marvelous characters: the gyro copto captain,  the feral kid, Papagallo, the dog,  the beautiful woman warrior, the mechanic and, of course, Max to make it.
I hope in the future Mr. Miller will remember what made that film immortal and deliver more depth and dimension to the plot.
However if it's straight action you are looking for, then you will love it.",1456876800,3,995,4.5418994413407825
7225602,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Fury Road is a solid action romp in an era of sloppy, moronic flicks from the likes of Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich.  Lots of practical effects and impressive stunts highlight this rollercoaster.  The downside is the story and the acting... In that there really isn't any.  There is just enough of a premise to start the chase that takes the entire movie, but ultimately, it's just an action movie.  It certain does take me back to the good days of the early-to-mid-80's, but doesn't do too much to set out apart in an action sense.  The difference bewteen this film and something like The Running Man is the technical advancements that allow for much more dynamic action and trickier shots.

Visually, this movie is gorgeous.  For a film that takes place entirely in the Namibian desert, it does have a lot of color and visual contrast and it also has a lot of very cool concepts and ideas executed well on screen.  My favorite being the villains' battle march being led by a metal guitarist standing in front of a vehicle-mounted wall of speakers and held loosely in place by bungee cables.

All that said, the acting is mostly non-existent and the two leads are given next-to-nothing to do outside of drive and shoot.  There are certainly pieces of this movie I felt went on far too long and sections that could have even been removed entirely.

All-in-all, this is a one-and-done for me.  I will not be rushing to see it again any time soon and I certainly do not get the Oscar nod, which I can only justify by the realization that there were next to no quality films in 2015.",1456876800,,1583,4.535211267605634

7225609,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This film is pure escapism fun - check all logic at the door, sit back, and get ready to enjoy over-the-top costumes, characters, vehicles, sets, and acting.  ""Fury Road"" takes the wonderful post-apocalyptic outlandishness of ""Road Warrior"" and ""Thunder Dome"" to new heights.  Replacing Gibson with Hardy is no stretch - neither actor was playing Hamlet, just ""MAX"" - the emotionless road warrior who sets out to survive for the sole purpose of avenging the death of his family at the hands of the ""bad guys"".  I give extra kudos to this film for not relying on cursing, sex or excessive gore to tell a great story.  Additional kudos go to the writer(s) and producers for not trying to make this film something other than what it is - i.e., pure entertainment.  Too many writers and producers nowadays try to overlay their films with heavy-handed politically-correct messages - don't look for them here.  (I'm sure any D+ psych major can find lots of subtle PC stuff in this film, but that's no surprise - they can find PC messages in Mother Goose, or anywhere they choose to look.)  Just enjoy the film for what it is - entertaining fun.

As for the DVD I am ordering not comporting to some promised ""special release"", I say ""give it a rest"".  The DVD I am ordering is the movie I saw in the theater, and the movie I loved and enjoyed.  All I want is to see the movie again (and again).  I have no interest in any ""special release DVD"" as it will not increase my enjoyment and appreciation of this film in its original form, and as I first saw it (and fell in love with it).",1456790400,,1575,4.452961672473868

If there is one scene that sticks in your head, it's the busty women hooked up to milking machines.....clearly an attempt to titilate some of the pervs out there. As an original diehard Mad Max fan, I can appreciate the story line and what the world becomes in the post apacolyptic. Other than the non-stop action and some really cool vehicles, this is a soulless film that relys almost exclusively on continuous violence and perversion to hold attention. The directors did a great job of dumbing down the story line to keep people with short attention spans entertained, and if you have a good surround sound system it will rock your house the entire film. I am sure black people will complain about this film since their were no blacks in the film. Woman's groups will complain because they have women hooked up to milking machines. Edit: 7/22/2016: Watched it again since I own it...just to give it another look in fairness. In all fairness, this flick was clearly targeted at pubescent thinkers, those folks into vilography/porn, and folks with short attention spans.....and also people with nice surround sound systems....otherwise it's soulless.

Mad Max and The Road Warrior are a couple of my favorite movies. Max is not much of a main character in this movie-he is a like a sidekick for Charlize Theron. The villans seem rehashed and cartoonish versions of Humongous and the desperate unhinged psycho punks that populated the earlier films.
The film has a strong visual style which is impressive, but the directors visual sophistication doesn't translate into good plot or character development.
There is no Night Rider, no Goose, no kid with a metal boomerang that slices dudes fingers off. The film has visual appeal, but doesn't build on or even significantly reference the  themes, plot, or characters that turned it into a franchise to begin with.",1456617600,,858,4.797297297297297

7225640,4,B00YQJRYGY,"There is a name for films that have good but not great performances and are a little weak in story but the fun aspect of the film more than makes up for it.  We call the popcorn films.  Low on emotional realism, not very ground breaking in story, but great fun to watch.  Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best popcorn films I have seen in years, possibly the best ever.  I hope to God it doesn't win the Oscar for Best Picture this year.  That sounds like a contradiction doesn't it?  I mean, isn't fun alone enough for an Oscar?  Well, no, at least in my humble opinion.  The simple plot of Mad Max is an excuse for action, action and more action.  But what great action.  It is set in a freak show of a post apocalyptic world where a cult leader, Immortan Joe, rules one community by controlling the supply of water.  One of his lieutenants is supposed to go on a gas run in an armored caravan, but is using the opportunity to betray him and take his 5 sex-slave wives to freedom.  Joe detects the ruse and sends all of his loyal troops, who are apparently hoping to go to Valhalla, after them.  The chase is on, and all the fighting happens while the on the road at full speed.  I would say about 75% of the film is high speed action.  Fighting is done with grungy vehicles souped up for road combat.  The whole costuming and vehicle design is something from Heavy Metal Magazine (the fantasy mag, not a music mag). Joe wears a breath mask that looks like a skull.  His war boys are pale, bald and almost emaciated,  his lookout is a midget.  This is a movie not afraid to be bizarre.  The characters are named Immortan Joe, Furiosa, The People Eater, Nux, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and Rictus Erectus (Mad Max is the most normal name in the film).  Joe chases his prey with two dozen vehicles, dozens of pale war boys ready to fight and die for him, and a large truck carrying Komodo drum players and a guy playing heavy metal riffs on a guitar in front of a moving wall of amplifiers to keep the troops in battle psyche.  Max gets into the film by being captured at the beginning and used as a blood bag for one of the war boys (they apparently need to have periodic blood infusions).  He is taken along as a captive for the first league of the chase, but I'm sure there is no plot spoiler in telling you he hooks up with Furiosa and joins her in helping rescue the girls (come on, no one thought the title character was going to spend the whole film chained up to the front of a car).
  There is just enough character development with the wives and Furiosa and one of the war boys, and just enough battle buddy chemistry between Furiosa and Max to make us care about the characters and their fate.  But human drama is here to serve the action, and the action is spectacular.  Seriously, my heart was in my throat several times. The director only relied on minimal CGI and relied mostly on practical effects with lots of stunt drivers.  It must have taken a year to plan out all the intricate stunts.
  I had a lot of fun at this film and I recommend it to any action film fan with an imagination.  But it doesn't have much human emotion and is not nearly an interesting enough script to be the Best Picture of the Year, such as, well, any of the other films nominated. This film carries the sensibilities of 70s drive in movies, grind house cinema, exploitation films. Sensationalism doesn't triumph over substance, it is the substance.  Here it's done with a big budget and directed by a professional.  Any wonder that Quentin Tarantino named this his favorite film or 2015?
  What the critic for Time magazine said of Kill Bill applies here.  ""This is magnificent nonsense.  That's not an insult.  The key word is magnificent.""",1456531200,,3739,4.3497109826589595

Theron is fine in the Furiosa role, at least as good as anything she's done (and I was amazed by her in Monster) and the naive lancer/ semi-protagonist Nux (Nicholas Hoult) is quite excellent in his. The right sorts of things explode at the right times, and the villains are appropriately villainous, and the heroes are appropriately to find.

Someone watching this movie without knowing what the title is would think that Furiosa is the main character.  The movie seems to revolve around her and Mad Max is just there to be her sidekick.  She is portrayed as smart and tough, but Mad Max doesn't get the same treatment.  In the first half of the movie at least, Max doesn't talk much, and when he does it's more grunting than actual talking.  What were these producers thinking to dumb down their main character like this?  If you don't believe me, look at the photo on the cover of the blue ray case shown above.  Who is in the foreground looking at the camera and who is in the background looking away!  They should have named this movie ""Mad Max, Furiosa Road"", or ""Mad Furiosa"".

7225776,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is, sort of, the forth installment in George Millers Mad Max franchise that began in 1979 and starred Mel Gibson as the loner ex-cop Max in post-apocalypse Australia. After 25 years in development and a few false starts, we have a movie that is not a movie in the traditional sense but one 120-minute scene starring, sort of, Charlize Theron. The stars are the many faceless stunt people, who get more screen time than the actors. Max is a secondary character, whose involvement in the action is more technical than real engagement. Charlize Theron doesnt have the physical presence to carry an action film, especially not one almost purely stunts and CGI.

Fury Road doesnt have a plot, but the set-up is that Max (Tom Hardy) has been captured by the War Boys tribe and taken to the Citadel to be used as a blood donor. The Citadel is ruled by the grotesque Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls its destitute population by controlling a vast underground water supply. The Citadel has food, water, and an odd assortment of technologies, but it doesnt have gasoline. Joe dispatches Furiosa (Charlize Theron) in the War Rig, a tanker truck, to trade breast milk for gasoline. When Furiosa goes off-road, and Joe discovers that his Five Wives are missing, he sends the War Boys after her, Max chained to young Nux (Nicholas Hoult).

So ensues a 90-minute chase scene, in which the same things happen over and over again. No clue where Max gets his Herculean strength and superhuman stamina after being a human blood bank. Or why a bunch of pallid War Boys are shirtless in the desert heat and sun, likewise the scantily-clad Five Wives. No one perspires in days of constant combat, much less gets a sunburn or expires of heat stroke. Why would Joe abduct the beautiful Furiosa only to send her into battle, where she is mutilated, rather than make her one of his concubines? Why are there so many amputees, deformed individuals, and serious skin infections? Those people would not survive in that environment.

Its not supposed to make sense. Its supposed to entertain. It doesnt. You can make a short film without a plot, but not a two-hour film. You cant make any film without characters; these are one-dimensional and barely present. I realize that there are no movies anymore. Movie studios make transnational products from which they profit through licensing and merchandising. But I don't know who made the rule that the transnational products have to be terrible. A single 90-minute action sequence cannot be varied enough to make it interesting. And, without characters, there is nothing to engage the audience. I am impressed by Margaret Sixels editing, however, which deserves praise.",1454630400,3,2719,4.893709327548807

Something happened with this one.  It's not that Gibson is not Mad Max or that Theron wasn't the cute, fresh, very femine character she usually portrays.  There was something missing, purpose and connection to Max.  Very early on, I found myself saying, ""So what?"" and yawning.  I think the creators to establish a reason for me/the audience to become attached and concerned about the characters.  For me it was literally the last 20 minutes that I started to care.  That is way too long.

Beyond my lack of involvement, the chase, destruction, and misogynistic elements were good but not fresh.  Honestly? Don't bother with this one and rent the original three.  Oh yeah the original Mad Max is a little clunky but new.",1454630400,,881,4.806666666666667

I will say this - the development of Max and Furiosa's relationship as they battle Immortal Joe and his minions represents one of the most interesting duos I have ever seen on film. I ended up watching the movie a second time with my wife. Even though she normally hates post-apocalyptic movies of this type, she had to watch and find out what would happen.

7225836,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This is a sort of reboot sequel. As with the bulk of the initial trilogy, it is set in a post-apocalyptic Australia. Max is wandering (well motoring) the wastelands when he comes into contact with a war-band ironically mixing Dark Ages religion with smash-up derbies.  Max finds himself helping the few nubile women to escape the breeding program. This involves a pursuit that occupies the great part of the film. This is suitably splashed with high octane action and high speed crashes. It has the feel of the second film but on steroids.
Given Maxs age here (perhaps he doesn't age, a bit like James Bond, or Biggles?) it is hard to know where the story fits with the others. Frankly, it doesnt really matter. Tom Hardy as Max has less to say than his predecessor Mel Gibson and with less charm. He is though more noticeably haunted by his past. The focus of course is not what he says but what he does and the bulk of the film is quite exciting, though very violent. The stunts are fantastic and I commend the director for achieving reasonable variety in depicting the violent road chase to keep interest up. Charlize Theron is good as Maxs driving companion. She is very tough and gets some great scenes. It is all very visual, luridly so at times. There is not a great deal of depth but its not really required. It doesnt matter if you're unfamiliar with the earlier trilogy either, as it works well, even best, in isolation. Recommended 3  stars",1454371200,,1451,4.576923076923077

No matter how much I disliked Thunderdome, at least it was about Max and continued the story from the latter movies. Fury road has been many years in the making and had been an on and off project making me wonder if it ever was going to be made. I was very excited and happy to see that it did. Unfortunately after all that time they came up with a movie with a title of Mad Max but had very little t o do with the character at all.  What we get is a movie more about a female character that mimics the max character and even beats the crap out of him and kills off an army of bad guys like it's nothing. Ok I guess male movie characters are weaker today than before or a ploy to get more women interested to watch. Regardless, the character max is now nothing more than a tag along with not much to say, just like many other characters in this film. If Miller wanted to make a movie about a woman tougher than any guy out there why name it Mad Max? Why not Mad Furiosa? The only thing that should make max mad in this movie is that it's not about him, it's his replacement character, Mad Furiosa! People easily entertained by great special effects will obviously give this movie 5 stars.

That is the only thing I can imagine as an explanation because there is absolutely no reason to like the characters. Not that they are unlikeable. The truth is, I frankly wouldnt know. They don't do much but drive, be dirty and shoot. There  is no depth to this movie and its characters are equally flat and undeveloped. I really couldn't care less what happened to them and think the movie may as well have been cast fully with stuntmen because you wouldnt know the difference anyway.

The disc is worth buying over renting due to the extras. It is hard to believe how much was not CGI. Great to see the car construction--I'd have liked more of that. The interviews were good.

It was okay overall but really just a simplistic long drawn out car chase. I thought the originals had more substance to them. I guess I must have missed something here. The acting was very good and the action was well done. One big gripe.... the interceptor. They wrecked it at the beginning and then it is stolen and made into a POS chase car and then it is totaled again. It was hardly even featured in the film which was completely stupid being it was one of the coolest features in the older films. That was a dumb move as far as I'm concerned.

I just fail to see this movie as having the caliber of an Academy Award nominated film. Worth a look if you are a fan of the series to see what they did as an update but not worth the hype. After this one and Star Wars I am starting to get the feeling people get so worked up over the hype of the films lately that they completely miss the actual film when they watch it....

The film itself is pure action, and there is hardly any downtime.  I love the original Mad Max movies with Mel Gibson, but I think Tom Hardy does an excellent job of filling his shoes.

I also truly appreciate the genius that can go into evoking a well-crafted, believable, other-worldly atmosphere on film.  I'm not repulsed by graphic violence when it is part of the montage.  However, in this film NO time is invested in meaningful character development;  there is NO viable history laid out or mythology;  NO romance;  NO believable morality;  NO attempt to move toward HOPE (though that is presented as a theme at the end) ;  NO nobility (in spite of Valhalla being mentioned repeatedly); and NO heroes we can truly love.

I loved the original 1st 2 Mad Max films, because besides the incredible stunt work, there were characters you could care about. This new incarnation has our main character, for the 1st 1/3 of the film, serving as a ""blood bag"" - a human IV donor - for one of the cretins driving one of the vehicles. The film celebrates ugliness and despair in it's look and feel of a future race of ""humans"" who would be better off dead. The last movie I saw as much of a downer as this was the awful Snowpiercer.

A huge, heavily armed mobile combat team (The Baddies) fail to successfully intercept and stop a fully laden slow-moving fuel-tanker containing one man and a few women- one pregnant. (The Goodies )
In a world where water is as precious as gold, this fluid is occasionally gushed out onto the enslaved population standing on a sandy desert.
So,to the desert where another gang of baddies, who can only afford motorcycles, burn up a truck-load of fuel trying to capture ...a truck-load of fuel.
All sorts of evil and ingenious apparatus are used in an effort to stop the truck- but seemingly in this post-apocalyptic world, no-one has access to a shovel to dig a simple axle-busting trench.
Whether it's a Truck, a Train or a Stagecoach that is being pursued- the Baddies ALWAYS get onto the roof and create merry mayhem. The Goodies are ALWAYS pushed off the roof and end up being dragged along underneath with lots of close-ups of grinding wheels or pounding hoofs. A Baddie ALWAYS ends up in the cabin/ at the reins/ in the locomotive- or propped on the bonnet like some huge nasty bug.

But anyway, after reaching a spot just west of the Black Stump, the Goodies stop the rig and someone asks the question 'What the hell are we doing out here?' to which absolutely no-one has a satisfactory answer- given that 'Making a Good movie' has been totally ruled out.
So it's everyone back into the truck, chuck a U turn, throw out the driver's log book and don't even stop at heavy vehicle inspection stations. The rest is just the simple matter of returning home the way they came and overthrowing a ruthless, entrenched dictatorial regime.
Belief will need not only to be suspended- but utterly obliterated.

10 Oscar nominations including;
Best Unregistered Truck over twenty tonnes not driven by a Black actor.

It is one of the worst films I have seen in recent memory and undeserving of ANY nomination for anything except Best Waste of Time and Money.  One of the shocking things to me is there are people who actually like, or LOVED, this film to wit I ask, 'How could this be?'  I have seen thousands of films and not even MY imagination could stretch to the point of buying any aspect of this one.  It is one constant, pounding, loud, shoot-em-up, explode-em-up, lame never-ending series of non-stop senseless action with a plot so weak I hesitate to label it as having one.  When a character is on the edge of death in one scene and the very next one she's up walking around after a quick, um, blood transfusion, like I said earlier, no one's imagination can stretch that far.  I could expound for an hour on certain scenes, although there is little difference in any of them---it's the same ole-same ole for 2 excruciating hours.  10 Oscar nominations!  Really?!!

It definitely kept my attention, and it stayed close enough to the original Mad Max genre that it is getting a good watch again really soon. Charlize Theron honestly takes the top billing in this and she had lots of hard work in her role as Furion. Mad Max is pretty quiet in this movie, but that is no different than in the other Max movies. The Max movies are really wonderful, even though they are pretty old now, and I think they did a super job at getting the feel like the old ones do.

You need to let go of all your expectations of the past movies and any movie in general. Just watch it and stop waiting for x, y, and z to happen. Thats all I can say on that matter without spoiling it. The people who rated this move low were disappointed and that alone says they already mandated what the director should do x,y,and z, and were angry when it didn't happen. I can't stress enough that you need to let go and just watch this. There are so many unique cinematic moments here and you will miss them if you are waiting for  something.

Without diving into detail this movie shows you images and situations and leaves you to use your imagination and logic to figure out what brought the actors to those various situations. You are given no explicit explanation of what is taking place and must infer for yourself. That is the artistic masterpiece of this movie. Those who can see that will love this movie.

7226053,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a loud, rough, two-hour car chase that doesn't let up. It is also the one of the most artistic and technically consummate films I've seen all year. In my opinion, it bests the summer blockbuster crowd in many aspects such as cinematography, editing, and production design. I haven't been this riveted by a film since 2008's Dark Knight. As of this writing, Mad Max has now been deservedly nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. While the film's bombastic nature may not be for everyone, it is a fantastic entry into the action genre, and a stellar Blu-ray.

This review is based on the Best Buy steelbook, which aside from the packaging and CinemaNow digital copy, is no different from the standard release. The video transfer does justice to the cinematography, handling the frentic sequences without serious motion blur and colors that pop with the harsh yellows of the daylight and steely-blues of the night. Audio is presented in Dolby Atmos (TrueHD 7.1) and sounds just as manic as it should with the explosions and mayhem filling the background channels as well as plenty of low-end action from the roaring of vehicles.

Extras are a little on the short end, but enough for a standard release to satisfy anyone's curiosity regarding how the film was made. There are five featurettes: ""Maximum Fury: Filming Fury Road"" covers a 30-minute holistic view of the overall production where a commentary would've otherwise sufficed. ""Fury on Four Wheels"" is a look into the design of the film's vehicles. ""The Road Warriors: Max and Furiosa"" are interviews with Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron over the development of their characters Max and Furiosa. ""The Tools of the Wasteland"" is a look into the production design with significant emphasis on props. ""The Five Wives: So Shiny, So Chrome"" are retrospective interviews with the young actresses playing Immortan Joe's wives and about their time spent on production. ""Crash & Smash"" is a compilation of effects and raw take footage demonstrating how the elements come together to form the film's action sequences. Finally, we get three deleted scenes that aren't very long or understandably significant to the plot, but are nonetheless interesting to watch.

Director George Miller had apparently prepared a silent, black-and-white version that is unfortunately absent from this initial Blu-ray release, but given the film's success, it could resurface in a potential special edition. For now, we'll just have to settle by turning the color level to '0' on our TVs. The Blu-ray, itself, is otherwise stellar, and offers a fine technical presentation of one of 2015's best films.",1452729600,3,2664,5.077625570776256

I only started to watch this film because it was the only new movie on dish-on-demand today, and... Charlize Theron is in it. I have to admit, someone really tried to make this whole mythology make sense. First of all, the tone is kept 'aloof', meaning that there is not a scene of the 'real life' beyond the crazed biker heavy metal design. The director maybe sensed that the whole charade fails if tried to be seen as 'real'. So, the action moves the movie along... AND, the heavy-metal-biker-design-thing IS ""extremed out"", exaggerated so much as to be surreal or unreal, which somehow makes it more palatable; kind of like making the movie INSTANTLY ""iconic"", like a souped-up Rocky Horror Picture Show if it could be super-camp, or BEYOND CAMP. The action takes over, the characters are easy to differentiate, the sets are clear and believable. There is just enough characterization  to move the story along. The fight scenes and chase scenes and chase/fight scenes are fantastic, beyond choreography... into the realm of stylized super-design.

7226072,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I am a huge fan of this series. This Movie ""Fury Road"" was a big disappointment and a wasted opportunity to attract new fans to the other films.
Sometimes more is not better, but Hollywood rarely learns this lesson. It seems as though Hollywood thinks that the Millenials want and need over the top entertainment and visuals due to their short attention spans. ""Fury Road"" has beautiful cinematography and locations with minimal CGI. The shots and stunts are spectacular! For these alone I recommend viewing the movie.
However, the story is weak. I would have liked to get to know some of the characters--heck even an explanation of who they are or why they are in the film would have been great. Who is the ""Immortal one""? What is his relationship to Furiosa? Who is the dwarf quadraplegic shown in several shots? Who is the extremely obese man? Why doesn't Max have any diaologue? We never get to know him or any other characters really!
Why three different chase teams through the desert after Furiosa? Is the mission of the movie to find some ""Green Place'? I can't answer any of thse questions.
An excellent summary of the limited plot is SPOILER ALERT . . . .  SPOILER ALERT  when Furiosa's brigade stops in the desert and makes a u-turn to return to . . . The Citadel, where the film begins. It's almost an admission that this whole exercise was a round trip desert car chase without any real goal. I'm still confused about the relevance of the contents of the big rig, and the ""Mother's milk"" substance. Is it water that is now important? Is it Oil? Or is it water? Tough to decipher. This edition seems to try to combine elements of ""Thunderdome""  ---- the false hope premise of  promised lands---both Valhalla and the Green Place---with this new Citadel place.
I loved the guitar man on the truck and the motorcycle stunts. The visuals are entertainig. But without any character dimension fo Max or the others, this film is a big let down.",1452384000,,1949,4.624277456647399

Rating 2.5 out 5.0

Australian writer/director George Miller, who gave us a trilogy of Mad Max dystopian thrillers from 1979 through 1985, is back with his new incarnation: ""Fury Road."" For those who love sci-fi and action blended together, ""Max"" should be your thing. Miller's post-apocalyptic world takes place out in the desert where a group of mutants are lorded over by one Immortan Joe, a king worshiped as a god by his subjects, who sports a mask that resembles a human skull. His warriors look like modern-day skinheads and there's also a grand coterie of Joe's subjects, akin to medieval peasants, Joe controls the water supply at his fortress called ""The Citadel"" and also owns a small harem of sex-slaves he maintains for breeding purposes (these women appear to be the only healthy ones in the realm).

The protagonist is Max Rockatansky, now played by Tom Hardy of Inception fame. Rocktansky is captured by the skinheads and makes a futile attempt to escape from the Citadel early on. The character with the bigger part for a while is Imperator Furiosa played by an enervated Charlize Theron. Furiosa moves things into Act 2 when she kidnaps Joe's concubines and drives in a souped up tanker truck headed for the mythic ""Green Place,"" which supposedly is some kind of aqua-infused paradise. Joe's minions give chase in a crazy assortment of different vehicles, all patched up from parts remaining after the Apocalypse.

We don't hear much from Max since his face is hidden by a steel mask and he's strapped to one of those weird vehicles which is chasing Furiosa. After a series of spectacular chases and crashes, Max finally gets free of his captors (but still must have Furiosa assist him in cutting a chain that binds him to one of the skinheads (Nux) who ironically joins Furiosa and her group after deciding there's great glory working for the rebels than bad guy Joe.

The long continuous chase to capture Furiosa temporarily slows down when the good guys must navigate their way through a canyon controlled by hostile forces. After successfully breaking through the canyon blockade, Furiosa finds an old woman who belongs to the Vuvalini, the clan which Furiosa was kidnapped from as a child. Wouldn't you know it but the old woman makes it clear that the ""Green Place"" is indeed a myth so what are the good guys to do?

The plan is to finish off Joe's forces on the way back to the Citadel (which they successfully accomplish) and then kill the king and gain control of the water supply, much to the peasantry's delight. This of course allows Mr. Miller to stage another big chase scene, just as spectacular as the one in the first half.

That's basically it. ""Fury Road"" is nothing more than one big chase scene after another. After a while, the whole thing just gets a little tiresome. One can admire the production design and how the chase scenes are choreographedbut the script is so paper thin, that the best rating I can muster here is 2.5 out of 5.

7226085,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Graphic and fiery, nonstop action chase sequences in ""Mad Max Fury Road."" Many, many, many, many, violent vehicle crashes through a scenic desert wasteland which appears like even more of a nightmarer world than the prior movies, in search of ""Green."" It maximizes how many crashes can get fit into one single movie. The crashing action fits in with the movie's story, and energizes smoothly the many transitions and scenes pieced together in basically one huge crashing fireball!

The story goes along with the previous movies, while taking a detour with new characters. An insider ""Furiosa,"" succesfully is escaping the dictated cult of violent chrome worshiping gang of road ragers, willing to end their lives in the pursuing chase set forth by their leaders lust, while all yelling Valhalla before they die in failed attacks ending in a crash.

The first scenes turn into this escape, and the action travels through a huge sand storm filled with tornados, filled with some huge crashes of pursuing vehicles. This first escape into a sand storm fixes with plot frlm that point on, being a movie about escape, and this first sequence creates the character building of who Mad Max is and how he becomes a leading hero character.

""Furiosa,"" discovers her escape is continuously compromised. She hoped to escape by navigating her huge tanker truck through a narrow mountain canyon. While traveling through this mountain pass ""Furiosa"" is betrayed by her own escape plan, falling under attack from pursuers, but now has a strong new alliance with Mad Max. This is all followed by another huge sequence of events, causing an explosion temporarily stopping the previous pursuers. Then the pursuers become attackers from within her own escape plan.

To avoid spoiling the plot and movie, the action continues, with even more crashes. There are so many violent crashes the surprises at the destinaton causes even more challenges. Most challenges are the action filled pursuing attacks and the result are pursuers crashing. Then another crash, then another crash, and then a completely unpredictable ending.

Once ""Furiosa"" reaches what she thought was her former people, there is some brief partial nudity, but it is knowingly only a trap set for outsiders which Furiosa avoids when announcing she is one of them too. Mostly what follows is the discovery the sought for ""Green"" world, they were fleeing to, is basically back where they passed and is only a uninhabitable swamp. This causing them to plan to make a U Turn through the hell they escaped, since it has water and some ""green"".

But, ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is more than just a bunch of attacks and crashes. It includes a plot filled with  betrayal, and from within the first moments the movie begins there is a new bad road rager gang member being humanized to not appear so evil, and of course this forshadowed him turning out to become a hero finding redemtion amongst ""Mad Max"" and ""Furiosa."" He turns into a ""Good Samaritan,"" helping the good cause more and more until he crashes to help save his new found hero friends.

The movie is similiar to the prior ones because it includes the escaping of an enslaving warlord controlling people, with the limiting of water, and the ruthless attacks on the road. But it is also different because the heroes seem to find inner weaknesses. The warring antihero leader's fate is him being eventually killed in his own chase of ""Furiosa"". He is also ironically ripped apart to pieces by the people he ruled, and some of them recently and previously cheared for his enslavement tactics regarding water, and his leadership. So there are many mad, mad, mad, people.

It could possibly be a more violent and bleaker world than the previous Mad Max movies. But with that, there seems to be some good moments of hope never seen possible before in a ""Mad Max"" movie, in the over throwing of the wasteland's former dictator. There is a balance of the good and the bad throughout the movie, tipped to the good side winnjng over at the end. The movie even seemed somewhat optimistic but in a brutally earned way. Even though it appears they end up in a very violently destroyed world, there is a powerful resiliance about the surviving heros.",1452297600,,4227,4.876044568245125

I watched Mad Max and Road Warrior 47 and 45 times respectively. I had hoped that this reboot would succeed in telling a different story in a more sophisticated fashion, like the Star Trek and Battlestar Gallactica reboots.
But many scenes were so copied from the earlier movies, I had the nagging feeling like I was reading a book that was cut and pasted together. As if dialog and story are a tool to stitch visuals together.
I enjoyed watching the movie, the acting was fine, the story made sense, and it's refreshing to see a post-apocalyptic (versus apocalyptic) movie... society trying to rebuild itself, that sort of thing. Yes, it's better than three stars... I just can't get the brilliance of the earlier movies out of my gourd.

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
MM & RW posed Max as someone who was used to rally society. Those movies made the point that society needs someone to believe in. This movie depicts Max as just a clever guy, so that really diminishes the significance of both the character and of society. And as far as plausibility, given the Fury Road setting, Max is a brutal scavenger out for his own interests only. So why doesn't he stick around for a high seat in the new power structure?
And man, the society sure did change their blind allegiance to the new leader quickly.... the witch is dead, now we're all YOUR servants. Ugh.",1452211200,,1384,4.603238866396761

They had an original plot, new action and chase sequences, creative/crazy apocalypse vehicles, a hero and heroine you could cheer for,s and a decent villain to hate, plus enough henchmen to make rack up the body count.

Worth watching, even buying. I bought the Blu-Ray. Will probably watch a few more times, there's lots of action throughout the whole film.",1452038400,,542,4.705263157894737

7226115,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Now, that's how you do a relaunch, or sequel, or whatever you want to call it! Tom Hardy isn't quite Mel Gibson, but he's close, and this movie is superior to the other Mad Max films on a technical level. For all intents and purposes, this is a remake of ""The Road Warrior"" or ""Mad Max 2"" (depending on what side of the pond you reside). If you're going to revisit a Mad Max film, that's the one to see. This is another one of those franchises that sails along predominantly on the success of only one of its entries.

Don't be too freaked out if you can't comprehend the plot. There really isn't much of a plot beyond chase, chase, and more chase. Heck, even watching the other Mad Max films isn't going to orient you any better because there isn't complete consistency with the rules of the world. Even actors who are killed off in previous versions come back playing similar characters only to not be recognized.

The way I've made sense of the Mad Max mythology is to think of it as a very stylized version of Hell. The world seems to exist only to torment people, and torment seems eternal. Max himself manages to rise above the general miserableness...although he's not immune to it. This vague scenario allows for the filmmakers to throw in comments on society basically at will. It's the social commentary that connects this apocalyptic vision to reality and gives it some weight. But don't focus on it too hard or you'll miss the fun.

If you've never seen a Mad Max movie, start here, then go Road Warrior, Thunderdome, and then the original.",1451952000,,1552,4.516014234875445

7226134,4,B00YQJRYGY,"In the classic film ""The Road Warrior,"" you could practically taste the dirt and grit and film stock as the spring-loaded road machines launched themselves into repeated controlled chaos. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a far more grandiose vehicle, all hot house hues drawn from an autumnal palate. The color scheme seems lifted from the world of Italian opera - Tuscan sunset is the predominant shade - and certainly the film plays on opera's gargantuan scale, but the soundtrack and ethos is one of death and heavy metal, and intricate violence and locomotion is a hypnotic yet electrifying mix of ballet choreography, martial arts, Warner Brothers cartoons, parkour and, as reported, Cirque du Soleil. The overarching plot proves largely a chimera: Max breaks free from his tormentors and hijacks a war rig driven by a one-armed, largely mute Sigourney Weaver knockoff (Charlize Theron) who is driving a payload of human lovelies, one pregnant, to a mythical green world beyond the desert. They knock off popgun challenges until Imortan Joe, ruler of the Citadel, wearing a fright mask I swear I've seen in other films, and his crazy unit comes calling on Fury Road. Charlize has had enough of living under his thumb and hightailed it out of this world of rationed water and stratified subjugation. At the bottom are the stragglers who have survived the apocalypse, just clinging to life by whatever water Joe pours down from his mountain. The next level up are bone white blind followers, who resemble the wild natives deep in the jungles of North Vietnam in ""Apocalypse Now."" I doubt it is coincidence. Almost all potential symbolism of the film is left untapped: the virginal cargo, the primal urge to return home, the need to maintain any vestiges of humanity. It's virtually all nearly psychedelic action. The set pieces are one mayhem-filled wow moment after another. Each assault is its own brief, intricate piece of violence that sparkles and then vanishes in the sand and is replaced by the next permutation. The bobbing and weaving pole cats - sort of apex pole vaulters that ride high above their vehicles and slingshot and swoop into the war rig's windows and sunroof to attack - are the most thrilling of all. As in ""The Road Warrior,"" director George Miller shows he has few peers in action filmmaking. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is never boring. The choreography and editing are stunningly focused. You never will say, ""What just happened?"" only, ""That did not just happen!"" Yet apocalypse in the Australian desert, in a film, just maybe shouldn't be this empty. Perhaps a post Earth this barren and tribal is enough, but the movie is famished for humanity, and I think it hurts because of it. Fear rarely enters the minds and hearts of anyone, no matter how dangerous the moment. When a man climbs atop a screaming rig surrounded by crazed killers to walk to the rear to repair something, he ought to show some fear. Deaths bring barely a pause. A brief romance does sprout up, but it dares not take its place beyond a throwaway in the hurtling drive of the action. It's hard to care because the action is so damn good, but the sterility in such close quarters with living, breathing people can gnaw at you. An old woman in a biker gang, called The Keeper of the Seeds, who keeps a small chest of precious strains like keys to the future, is probably the chief representation of hope in a film that doesn't traffic in such silly things.

In fact, I think it was ridiculously positive towards women while still appealing to men. The women in this film are basically Victoria's Secret models who don't have to get naked to be hot, pull their weight, fight back against the men who try to oppress them and ultimately kick butt. There are also women in the film who kick butt and aren't shown as sex symbols (Charlize Theron's character for one) making it a good mix of both. The sepia and cold blue tones of the movie set a mood and were visually stunning. The acting was actually quite impressive and the action was nonstop and edge of your seat.

7226194,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I don't think there's much needed to explain here, as the film is by and largely already accepted as one of the greatest movies of all time. All I can really say is this.

Mad Max: Fury Road isn't about Max. This is Furiosa's story, Max is the supporting character that is headlining the magnificiently done supporting cast. From the fully realized 'original' post-apocalypse wasteland to the near entirely real vehicular stunts to the heart pounding action and thundering music, Fury Road is a film that has no true equal, even if the story isn't as perfect as the rest of the film.",1451088000,,583,4.660194174757281

7226198,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I heard the buzz before watching this movie, but decided I would watch it, after enjoying viewing the first three in the series numerous times over the years.  As many others have mentioned, Max is a supporting character in this one.  Where Theron's character is concerned, he is for the most part, there to take a back seat to Furiosa.  This Max is clearly not the Max of the first three films.  The scene where Max is unable to take a shot on the advancing bad guys, and Furiosa steps in to take the rifle from his trembling hands is laughable.  It's completely inconsistent with the established character from the three films in the series before Fury Road.  Also, the fight scene between Max and Furiosa seriously stretches the limits of credibility.  A one armed middle aged woman versus a  two armed tough guy, and it's essentially a slight advantage to Max?  The problem isn't the depiction of a capable, tough female character, for me.  The problem is that this film presents us with an overwhelmingly negative portrayal of the majority of male characters.  The only two that have a positive light cast on them are Nux and Max. The rest of the male characters are hell bent on enslaving,  or destroying their fellow denizens of the wasteland.  Whereas the female characters range from victims, to unrealistically badazz superwomen.

  This movie is essentially The Road Warrior with a female lead, less character development, and access to better special effects.  From my perspective, the Mad Max series has gotten progressively worse.",1451088000,3,1544,4.876923076923077

Also it is one of the few entertaining movies I have ever seen that was almost entirely 'chase scene action' ... but when you've captured 480 hours of DIGITAL car chase filming you can splice together quite an impressive chase 'scene' that lasts a mere 2 hours! The acting which was done all through the car chasing also had a very authentic feel even though a 'real' human being couldn't possibly stand all that 'torture', mayhem and personal damage.

7226272,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max (Tom Hardy) winds up a blood donor for a low-level combat driver in a post-apocalyptic town where the main commodity is water. Water is pumped up from deep underground and given to the locals to keep them local. The leader is a fellow named Immortal Joe. He maintains the water distribution, trades with Gas Town and Bullet Town, has an army to caravan the water around, and has a group of wives. Or he had a group of wives--they've snuck out in one of the water delivery trucks driven by Imperator Furiosa (an unrecognizable Charlize Theron). She is taking them to a green place, the Land of Many Mothers, where they won't have to be incubators for Immortal Joe's offspring. Joe doesn't take kindly to them leaving and mounts up a retrieval mission. The combat driver brings Max along so he'll have enough blood (they are attached by a tube after all). It's a slim excuse to get Max into the action but it does get him there. Lots of road chases and fights follow.

The real star of the movie is the amazingly inventive action sequences. No two vehicles are the same and they are all DIY smash-ups of at least three vehicles. Some are mounted with harpoons; some with flame throwers; some with really big guns; some with cow-catchers; some with plows (it makes sense in the moment they are used but at no other time); some with cranes; some with big long sticks with a harness on the end so guys can come flying in to attack another vehicle and fly back out (also only makes sense when they are used); most vehicles have combinations of the foregoing. With all this random equipment, the forces of good and evil can have plenty of tightly-choreographed and eye-popping battles. The sequences are well-shot and edited so viewers can follow the action and know who is where (which doesn't always happen in modern action films). It's breath-taking and fun and completely bonkers.

Sure, there's references to hope in hopeless circumstances, and how people aren't things and shouldn't be treated like things, and characters seeking redemption. But that is all more or less window-dressing to give viewers something to care about in the slight pauses between the amazing action sequences. This is a high-octane, over-the-top action film with just enough heart in it to hold things together.",1450051200,,2294,4.761306532663316

This has to be the best two-hour-long chase scene in history with lots of twists and surprises, including how well fleshed-out the peripheral characters are. Charleze Thereon shines as Imperator Furiosa, and each one of the 'wives' is a distinct personality. One of the things I loved most about this movie is the Many Mothers were also kick-butt heroines, and even the Lost Boys, when you get to know them, are fleshed out characters and not just nameless, faceless bad guys. Nux's redemption is heart-wrenching, as is how well he responds to Capable's kindness. And of course who doesn't love a good bad guy? Immortan Joe gives us an idea of how a Warlord can use ignorance and propaganda to make people believe he is an actual god and not just a psychotic despot. And Max ... Max is a man of very few words. His introduction is probably the most he speaks in the entire movie, and that works. In fact, there is very little dialogue in this movie. Just not-stop, heart-pounding action.

7226316,1,B00YQJRYGY,"The problem with video games nowadays is that their pernicious influence has spread to the medium of the commercial mainstream film, a genre of both entertainment and social commentary that used to be capable of taking itself more seriously. Rather than looking like a comic book (or the pretentiously labeled ""graphic novels""--I love that one) as intended, George Miller's newest take on the Max Rockatansky mythos carries none of the beauty of a silent film but it carries a lot of graphic video game-oriented ugliness. My problems with this new film are legion, so follow along with me, and we shall list:
a) This film is a major disappointment to exploitation film fans. If you go to a Mad Max picture, you expect Mad Max, no? It's all been replaced by an annoying political correctness, which to this reviewer spells unadorned cowardice on the part of the filmmakers.
b) The ""practical"" effects in this movie are done on high tech computers and the whole film is whitewashed in CGI and the like.
c) Along with ""Shaun the Sheep"" and other films I witnessed this summer and fall, there is a growing trend of spoon feeding illiteracy that these filmmakers are trying to push down the throats of viewers--silent films were very literate indeed, remember?
d) Just because there is very little blood spill (compared to many other cinematic atrocities that I've watched lately) does not mean that the same malicious sensibility of violence is not as strong in this picture as it is in the others.
e) This is an anti-patriarchy film, which borders on an anti-American sensibility that I cannot quite put my finger on but whatever looming presence that is hovering over this film is one of utter contempt for (and persistent mistrust of) men in general.
f) The action itself--which is really all this film has to sell--is boring, dull, and moving-so-quickly-that-I-couldn't-see-what-in-hell-was-going-on style that will please ADD children and short attention span ""adult-children"" but discriminating viewers no.
g) The naked lady. Yes, she is naked--but it's hard to see much, and the camera doesn't linger on her flesh. Why? Because this is a mockery of the old exploitation films, in which nudity--mostly female--was a way of life. Does the word cowardice fit?
h) Mad Max is a woman-like figure here, a mid-wife if you will. He is only allowed to stay with the women at the end after he has been made sensitive by the feminist politics that this movie projects. He begins the film as a gagged damsel-in-distress, ends up being saved by a herd of pretty women, and is not even given the consolation of defeating the main villain (because that wouldn't be emasculating enough to keep him in character). In many ways, the women are allowed to be tougher than he ever is. If you release a film called Mad Max, why not allow him to be, oh I don't know, MAD??!!! Why? Because the movie ticket buyer is ripe for being insulted, so here it shall be.
i) Wasting Charlize Theron. This woman is a beauty, but not acting like Ripley/G.I. Jane walking around in a butch haircut that the original Mad Max wouldn't have been caught dead in. It's not visually appealing, certainly not to me! Her ""deep"" performance is only on the level of a video game character, if it indeed goes as deep as that even.
j) The original Mad Max film (also by the fairly timid Miller) was certainly not violent enough to come across, but the original was a vigilante revenge picture (certainly muscular and manly when it counted) about a dismayed policeman who took the law into his own hands in order to mete out proper justice for his family, all of whom were brutalized and murdered by thugs. But our present age isn't interested in justice, it's suffering from a gender anxiety attack, so afraid to step on anyone's toes that they treat gender as if it's something new in our society. I realize that Miller wanted the film to be comic book more than anything else, but his characters most likely don't speak because they have no ideas left to share. This gender obsessed culture will have to grow up eventually, and this is a Mad Max picture geared towards the Caitlin Jenner generation. I suspect that the paid critics working for the last newspapers in the country (which are tragically on life support as we speak) love it because they are told to, but I never expected audiences to eat up this gross perversion of the Max series as ravenously as they have.
k) There is no joy behind this movie for me because its agenda lies somewhere opposite of entertainment, and that's the bottom line. Why can't we have fun at the movies anymore? Why must everything reflect terrorism, ground zero, torture, and being chased down for one's very life? My theory? The world will not be able to stop the insane feeding of hostile emotions that its newest entertainment, television news, and Internet media is currently bombarding it with, but I guarantee you that when the apocalypse comes hurtling in your back door that it won't be nearly as much fun as this movie thinks it will be.
l) George Miller can direct special effects films but he is NOT a genuine action director (exemplified here by the lack of intense violence and bloodshed). Action pictures used to be about more than just brutalizing the audience with extreme violence and terror. A gifted action picture maker can make a film with great adventure, color, and hair-raising escapades throughout without spilling a single ounce of blood. Miller's film has the plasma drained out of its viscera for the most part, but it is still a bunch of hedonistic violence when you pull it apart and look at it. But even though he is a special effects guru now, he shouldn't be deemed the greatest action director. This one was made in an office, not in the field.
To sum up this broken down review, I have to add that today's films are involved in an all out assault upon traditional notions of manhood and masculinity, and while it might be okay with some people it doesn't sit well with me personally. Do women really want to become men this badly? There is a cruel Freudian joke I could put in here, but I won't out of politeness. But this movie is nothing more than two hours of emasculated dreck aimed at a generation who doesn't know any better and who are sadly proud (even now) of that fact.

The Blu-Ray and DVD offered here are absolutely fine in terms of the picture and sound representation. I saw this one in theaters in 3-D and it was difficult to see what the hell was going on. The extras illustrate how Miller and his crack team of CGI specialists attempted to ""script"" the film only from storyboard material alone, which certainly explains a lot in terms of understanding the film's dialogue and character development. But what they don't tell you in this extra is that they are really only working towards corrupting and perverting yet another profound cinematic memory. Mad Max is left in the dust and is suffering the mirage-induced illusion that women can be men and men women and so on. But even if this is a big deal for some people, who cares? I wanted to watch a new Mad Max movie and I didn't get it. In the final analysis, Miller's newest film is too jokey and too silly for its own good, as if even he cannot take seriously the idea of a herd of sensitive beauties becoming vigilant warriors against a sadistic patriarchy (and personally, I wish Miller would make more films like BABE and HAPPY FEET because in those films he is on his proper ground. (And, as a personal gripe, if I have to keep paying for these damned 'digital copies' that these distributors keep tucking away in these DVD packages I will be forced to write a 'sound off' letter. I am grateful that you all want to watch this on your i-phone while bicycling to work, but I want to see films how they were meant to be seen. Why can't we just pay for a digital copy here on Amazon if we so desire?) F+
(Pssst! Here's the public's logic: Indiana Jones being a survivor of a nuclear blast inside of a steel-lined toy refrigerator in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was hopelessly moronic. Conversely, watching a rodent-like mutant jam away on a heavy metal guitar while strapped to a big rig attached by bungee cords while others play macho drum beats atop gasoline tankers to announce their rampage across the CGI desert is innovative and brilliant.

One can only hope that the technical triumph of Mad Max mixed with a stroy that is just good enough will lead to a wave of properly made films. The practical effects are just incredible and make the movie far better than it would be otherwise. The realism of everything happening on screen takes a mediocre at best story and propels it to something far greater than the sum of its parts. Mad Max is pretty disturbing, features very little Max, and instead features a fantastic female lead in the process - so much so that it ought to have been called Mad Furiosa.

7226346,2,B00YQJRYGY,"In light of all of the praise this movie is receiving, I feel compelled to provide a counterpoint. I didn't hate the movie, but there was plenty to be disappointed about.

SPOILERS BELOW:

(1) Why did it take three screenwriters to pen this movie? It's essentially a two-hour car chase with little dialogue (I'm guessing there are more grunts in this movie than actual words). The whole thing feels like Miller forgot what made the previous installments (or any action movie) work, character development and varied pacing. The action, which feels like a nonstop anxiety attack, does eventually stop for a couple of short interludes, and those moments feel so jarringly out of place as to feel like they're part of another movie entirely.

(2) Character development: There isn't a single character in this movie that can't be described in less than a couple of words, so much so that their names usually provide all of the character summary you ever get (Mad Max, War Boys, the Wives, Keeper of the Seeds, Nux/Nuts, etc.). There is no arc at all for any of them, especially the two main characters, Max and Furiosa. Nux, a minor character, is the only one that even remotely ""changes,"" and even that is so quick as to be a bit silly (born and raised as a War Boy, he is instantly softened by a woman's gentle caress). There was little in ""Fury Road's"" characters that elevate this movie to the plateau reached by its series' predecessors, which demonstrated that magnificent action could be coupled with interesting characters whose fate you are invested in. Take ""Road Warrior"": Max starts out as unlikable, he slowly regains some humanity and you care about what happens to him, and then in the end you're moved by the plot twist (he's unwittingly driving a tanker full of sand) and the concluding scene that leaves him as ""God's Forgotten Man."" There's nothing like that arc for any character in ""Fury Road."" In the end, we're given no significant reason to invest in any of these characters beyond ""I hope the good guys can outrun the cartoony bad guys.""

(3) Which brings us to the feeble ""feminism"" of the movie, in which women have to be either tough as men or are supermodel breeding chattel. For a movie that wants to explore gender themes, it would have certainly been nice if the bevy of female characters had had any further complexity beyond these two tired tropes: The Brides are completely indistinguishable from one another as characters (only different hair colors kept them from being interchangeable), and The Vuvalina occupy the opposite end of the spectrum as tough warrior gals with nothing to make them anything more than stock types (except one of them carries a bag of seeds and gets two lines of dialogue). Not a single one of these characters has anything resembling a real inner conflict (I'm not issuing any extra credit for the eight seconds when one Bride considers going back to her oppressor).

(4) This is a ""Mad Max"" movie essentially in name only. You could take the titular anti-hero out of the movie entirely, and nothing would be the worse for it. No part of the plot nor any of the themes require his presence in this movie. The past movies at least erected enough scaffolding of a plot to plausibly take Max on some kind of inner journey, from callous, self-isolating survivor to reluctant ally of the movie's sympathetic characters. This movie ostensibly has the same bones, but they're handled in such perfunctory, mechanical fashion (e.g., you nicked the leg of a Bride, now you have to help us) that it all feels paint-by-numbers. The scene of Max sitting in the truck refusing to drive as the folks who were using him as a ""blood bag"" bear down on him was silliness.

(5) Plot logic/holes galore. I guess it shouldn't be surprising that a movie with so little plot should have holes you could drive a war rig through:

  (5a) How did Furiosa contact the Brides, convince them to follow her into the desert, and then sneak them out of a giant vaulted room and into her truck (without her own truck crew even knowing about it)? Why would she even bother to do this for those particular characters? As the driver of the ""War Rig,"" when would she even come in contact with those characters (stuck in a vault, no less) in what seems like a society with such a strictly delineated caste system (warriors, peasants, milk maids, Brides, etc.).

  (5b) How did Furiosa ever make a deal with the desert marauders to let her pass and block her pursuers for a tank full of fuel? If the plan was to drop a bunch of rocks in the path of those in hot pursuit who want their gas tank back, how were those marauders going to speedily get that gas tank to safety? They didn't have a truck with them. I guess they were going to pull a truck rig full of gas with their motorcycles?

  (5c) How did Furiosa plan to deal with the War Boys on her rig once she defected? Good thing some more marauders showed up to conveniently dispatch those War Boys on her rig for her, otherwise she would have had to do so her self, all the while driving the rig.

  (5d) Why did the Vuvalina construct this elaborate ""bait trap"" in the middle of the desert? What was the execution or intention behind this trap if somebody besides Furiosa had showed up (who they had no idea was coming)? I have no idea why they set up this elaborate ruse that involved having one of them climb up a rickety tower and sit up there naked pretending to be in distress.

  (5e) How the hell was Furiosa and gang going to ride for 160 DAYS (!) across the salt flats on their motorcycles with the meager amount of fuel they had?

  (5f) What were those crazy fever dreams Max kept having? Oh...it was the madness resulting from the murder of some child that didn't appear in any of the other movies. Not that anybody could have figured that out based on what was in this movie or, more importantly, really cared one way or the other. Those creepy images were good for scaring the audience, but weren't particularly effective at making me care about Max's tortured soul.

  (5g) The extent of Max and Furiosa's plan at the end was to drive back with Immortan Joe's dead corpse on their hood, and then let Max, a former ""blood bag,"" be the one to undrape it before Joe's faithful gun-pointing minions. And this plan would not result in them either being shot, imprisoned on the spot, or rioting among Joe's ardent followers. Good thing this so-called ""plan"" worked so well!

(6) Flashes of inventiveness and imagination: With all of the movie's faults, there are admittedly some moments and ideas that you'd never find in films by lesser directors. And the action, on the whole, is well executed if wearing by the end. It's as if George Miller went into this movie with the attitude of upstaging movies like ""Fast and Furious."" I can imagine him saying ""You think you know how to stage and film a car chase, punks?!? I'll show you how it's done!"" And on that simple level he succeeds. Except for a handful of shots that distract with their CGI, most of the film does have a realistic grittiness, with what generally feels like real bodies in real space hurdling through the desert on giant gas-guzzling engines of velocity and destruction. There is a simple visceral thrill in that for a while, but not for two nearly uninterrupted hours. I was truly hoping for the wild, inventive transgressiveness of ""The Road Warrior,"" with it's homosexual motorcycle-riding punk/bondage villains, its unnerving sadism, its savages comically rutting in the dunes, its children reduced to feral mutes. ""Road Warrior"" had a truly original nightmarish vision of a world gone mad. ""Fury Road"" is a Chuck Jones cartoon by comparison, a brick to the face.",1449187200,,7721,4.640762463343108

1) This is the best action film ever made, bar none.
2) George Miller is a visionary, and the fact that in today's web metrics driven, CGI dependent pop corn movie industry he could get away with filming this absolute masterpiece that people will be enjoying decades from now, when the Transformers franchise and the Marvel Universe will be nothing more than bad memories and Michael Bay's legacy'll be relegated to a mere footnote on movie history, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

7226395,3,B00YQJRYGY,"In a post-apocalyptic world where water and gas are precious, a group of survivors steal a Warlord's 'war rig' and race for a mythical green land to the east.  Massive car battles, hot babes, and gruesome deaths ensue, all with Mad Max in the mix.

I liken this movie to a space opera, or like a 2 hour light beer commercial with an unlimited budget for CGI.  It is so over the top and so implausible that one can only sit back and enjoy the visual and aural feast that is Mad Max Fury Road.  Everything is cranked up to a ridiculous level.  In The Road Warrior, the precious cargo was gas.  In Fury Road, the precious cargo is the Swedish Bikini Volleyball Team dressed in their bikinis, and the gas isn't called gas, it's called 'guzzle-lean', and the cars all spew giant plumes of fire laced with black smoke.

The story itself is so pointless that you just sit around waiting for the next car to get destroyed or body to get run over and wrapped around an axel.  And there is so little dialogue out of Max, that you wonder if he is a mute.  The screenplay must've been about 20 pages long.  Yet somehow, through all the grunts and screams, the men and women pair up and become lovey-dovey like that last slow dance at your high-school prom.  Because this is a Hollywood, and that's what Hollywood wants.  Even if the actors are mostly Australians and the film is shot in Morocco or some other desert place like that.",1449014400,,1420,4.377862595419847

I could care less about the main characters, the pace felt hurried and more like a music video, there were many aspects of the plot that did not make sense. I found it offensive the super models for the breeders, it would have been more apt to have well nourished women who looked like they actually have had children than these anorexic teens.  In fact the obese milkers would have been more representative of good protected breeders than this high school fantasy of models.  Charlize was the most interesting character but they didn't give her enough to do as with the tribal nomad women of her childhood.  We are to believe that these survivors would be willing to chuck all they know and go off on a suicidal mission with some whelp in five minutes of meeting her again.  Idiotic, full of dumb obviously intended camp moments of mayhem.  Trying to be camp does not work in films and this director didn't have the chops to do it justice.

7226444,3,B00YQJRYGY,"First of all, I didn't see any prior Mad Max films, so this review is based on the merits of this movie alone. There is so much missed potential in this movie! Lots of reviewers have said there's no plot. There IS a plot, just not a plot that's going to blow your mind--which is fine for an action movie. The action sequences are masterfully done, really. The vehicles are cool and there are a great many imaginative elements. If you play video games, it's reminiscent of Borderlands or Rage.

There is very little character development, which makes you not care what happens to anyone. Maybe even this could have been forgiven, if it weren't for the biggest problem with this move: TERRIBLE DIALOGUE. It's just horrible. If/when you can understand what the characters are talking about, it's all almost completely forgettable. There could have been some great humor and one-liners thrown in here. Instead, the writing seems to be going in an artsy direction, that's the best way I can describe it. As if they're trying to tell us how weird everyone is by making them talk weird. Everyone is crazy, we get it...why not make the dialogue coherent and as entertaining as the environment and action sequences? UGH.

We sat through it but we could have better used our time doing something else.",1448841600,,1291,4.733333333333333

7226446,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Fist time experience with Mad Max (never saw original) and I really love this movie.  #1 reason is the uniqueness of the characters and the story - this isn't your run of the mill, post-apocalyptic action movie.  Immortan Joe is one of those villains that you will remember forever along with his war boys, and the dialogue is the same. I haven't watched a movie in a decade that was so quotable. (Do not, my friends, become addicted to water, or it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence! and of course: You shall ride eternal. Shiny, and chrome."")  I love all of the vocabulary, Aquacola !! Guzzoline !! Blood-Bags!!, it's fresh and wonderful!  I was worried this was some kind of fast and furious garbage movie focused on cars, but it isn't - although the warboys and immortan worship the v8 and cars - it doesnt dominate the movie however in the least.

Highly recommend to everyone.",1448841600,,902,4.54320987654321

7226464,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The top five reasons to love this film:

5.) Acting. Charlize Theron brings an unrelenting animosity akin to Sigourney Weaver's character Lt. Ripley in ""Alien"" (1979).

4.) Production design. The costumes and armor are dark, fetishistic sartorial triumphs. The vehicles are elaborately constructed machines of mayhem subjected to beautifully photogenic sequences of massive destruction. Overall, the visual style is similar to that of the films of Ridley Scott: the environment and objects within have a gritty, worn-down quality to them that make them all the more realistic.

3.) Non-CGI action sequences and editing. In contrast to so many contemporary action films, this film relies on actual physical choreography rather than visual effects. It gives the film a more tactile, haptic quality. Also, the editing during these sequences is not the disorienting, quick-cutting kind we find in most action films- instead, it allows longer shots to let us establish the geography of the characters in relation to one another.

2.) George Miller. The fact that the studio allowed Miller, the director of the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy, to direct this installment made it possible to keep the spirit and style of the franchise alive. Furthermore, to give him a $150 million dollar budget, plus a potentially prohibitive R-rating, is a rare instance of Hollywood allowing creative freedom.

1.) Context. Over the past several years, moviegoers have been subjected to a barrage of terrible remakes/reboots of classic sci-fi/fantasy films from the 1970s, '80s and '90s: ""Total Recall,"" ""Robocop,"" ""Poltergeist,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Alien vs. Predator,"" every ""Terminator"" sequel since ""Judgment Day,"" just to name a few. This cinematic plague has now been temporarily rectified.

In an interview, Miller cited an Alfred Hitchcock quotation: ""I like to make movies where they don't need subtitles in Japan."" Miller's films are similar. ""Mad Max"" movies are like silent films with sound. A character's behavior is indicated less through dialogue and sound and more through gesture and camerawork.

That's why this was one of the best films of this or any year.",1448668800,3,2155,5.395833333333333

7226469,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie, as most people know, is a reboot of the George Miller Road Warrior/Mad Max franchise of the 1970s which launched Mel Gibson's career. The movie has a very simple story line. In a future desert wasteland a warlord's concubines are trying to escape from him with the help of one of his bosses, Imperator Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron). Max end up in the middle of the chase when the Warlord's army is sent after them. That is the bulk of the plot. There are other elements that I will not spoil, but the movie really is a very long chase movie, that turns into a race toward the end. Most of it is shot in the cab of a modified oil tanker truck.

Despite the title, Max is not really the main character of the movie. Theron's character Furiosa takes that billing. Max is, for the most part just along for the ride (literally and figuratively). His character has to decide which side to take, initially having no allegiance to either side, which is obviously not the case by the end of the film. It is in some ways similar to the original franchise, but also tells its own story, and does not just try to be a carbon copy. As I said earlier the plot is very simple, but it works. The main focus of the movie is the fact that it is basically non stop action from about the 20 min mark to the end of the film. There is very little character development (although there clues to Max's past sprinkled throughout the movie, and we learn some, but not all, of what is driving Furiosa.

For those who get the blu ray disc, the movie looks and sounds great. There are a few behind the scenes and making of features included, including how the special effects and CGI were blended with real stuntwork and practical effects. There are also some deleted scenes. All in all, about an hour and a half worth of extras.

It is impossible to say everyone will like the movie. You have to be a fan of action films and it helps, driving themed action movies. You have to be okay with the fact that the character backstories are not fully developed and that at times there is very little dialogue in the movie. If you can accept that, it is definitely worth checking out. Other reviewers have speculated on a larger blu ray release down the line with more extras and more editions of the movie. If you are one who really loves the movie and think it is one of the greatest films ever then you may want to stream it and wait for a later release. But otherwise, you may be content with this version.",1448582400,,2492,4.32051282051282

Yeah, that's about it as far as plot goes - sounds real ""edge-of-the-seat"" doesn't it?  Don't get me wrong - I'm a big fan of the original Mad Max movies, and this one has some tremendous stunts and action sequences - but the audience (at least those older than 13) are left wondering why we should care whether or not the protagonists get away and survive.  This one had some great potential, but the producers spent all of the budget on special effects and left only about $27.22 to pay for writers.

7226478,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Although it lacks the emotional depth of ""The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max"" this movie is still well worth watching for its edge-of-the-seat action sequences and the performances by Charlize Therion and Tom Hardy.
The story line is straightforward: In a post-apocalyptic world Therion is bent of rescuing a small group of young women who have been used as breeding stock by an aging madman. Pursued by the madman's minions, including the mysterious Max, who is himself being used in a hellish way, Therion and Hardy reluctantly join forces in an effort to save the young women.
Hardy brings much of the intensity to his role as Max that a young Mel Gibson did when he originated the character. Therion turns in an excellent performance as the warrior woman trying to rescue the young women. The writers gave her a prosthetic arm in this movie, which she uses to great effect in some of the fight scenes.
The dialogue is not award-winning, though I honestly didn't expect it to be given the fact that this movie is essentially one long chase through what's left of the world. I didn't consider this to be a real problem since the production was designed as an action/adventure and not a philosophical ramble through the darkness of some men's souls. The action is vivid, the special effects are extraordinary and together they make up for the lack of pithy dialogue.
Not a classic but for action/adventure fans ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is both interesting and fun to watch.",1448582400,,1466,4.775590551181103

7226483,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie is only for those who like post-apocalypse. action filled movies.  For the few who don't know the basic plot, a guilt-crazed loner is reluctantly but inexorably transformed into a world-saving hero. As such it is well conceived and developed in detail, although the plot is not a complex one.
  Furthermore, the movie  requires a fairly high tolerance for violence and extended car chases.  Despite my not qualifying on these last two qualities, I liked the movie.  The extended car cases do get boring for me after a while, but they are imaginative.  They are not  CGI so they are visually more realistic  and satisfying even as they are unbelievable as being based in any reality.  This is the best quality of the movie.
  The violence shocks but the director does not linger on them very long except when a main character is involved.  Here, of course, the heroes survive violence that would have killed a dozen people over.",1448496000,,938,4.7875

7226564,4,B00YQJRYGY,"The trouble with this movie is that the premise is getting long in the tooth. We've seen this desert world where people fight over gasoline before. It never made a lot of sense with Mel Gibson and now it makes even less without Mel Gibson. So while the stunts are bigger and better than ever before we don't care as much.

 What the hell went wrong and left the Earth in such a mess? When this series began people were worried about nuclear annihilation. But we don't worry about that sort of thing anymore. There has been a major effort to get the public concerned about Global Warming but that has begun to fizzle. Muslim terrorists are real enough but Hollywood thinks it's impolite to draw attention to the barbarities of Islam. So we have this warmed over view of apocalypse.

This is a chase picture. The Bad guys chase the good guys  far out into the desert. Then they turn around and chase them back to where they started from. I suggest that for the next film in this series they stage the big chase in a circular manner. The bad guys just chase the good guys in a big circle endlessly.",1448064000,,1095,4.379310344827586

7226580,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Lots of dangerous looking stunts involving motor vehicle crashes, making it hard to believe anyone could survive them. Reminded me of Fast & Furious franchise in that respect, but with other elements including sex/reproductive slaves escaping with the help of Furiousa and eventually Max and a war boy, the story aspired to be more than just a vehicular war movie. Acting is good all round. Didn't like the first act. Found it too confusing trying to figure out who the characters were, how their world operated, that sort of thing. The writer/director/editor didn't try hard enough in my opinion to present an understandable society in act one, sort of let the audience witness unfolding events and work it out for themselves, without giving enough information about who the characters were. By act II had it figured out, but act I should've been alot tighter, we should've been emotionally attached to Furiousa much sooner. Also, if you're going to have your hero's surviving over the top, intense, multiple battles with all kinds of vehicles, I'd prefer more believably shot crashes. Lots of action adventure films are not believable so didn't ding the film too hard on that, sort of graded on a curve (as so many films fail to establish a credible world), but what I did like, in addition to the acting, was the introduction of the woman warrior clan, Furiousa's people, liked that whole section of the film. Just found it touching how contented Furiousa was to be back amongst her people, and loved the way they responded to the news of her mother's death, and how she remembered the salute her people gave for fallen citizens. Ms. Theron is an outstanding actress and she just nails that sequence. My biggest complaint is the poorly structured act I (story initially inaccessible to the audience), but after that the story gets going.  Also I didn't find it helpful in terms of believability that there was a live band playing during the attacks using an electric guitar, how was it powered, filmmaker didn't bother to show. Having musicians play rock music without showing how or why just made me pause to ask, why would the villain put energy into having rock musicians play during an attack where he's supposedly pulling out all the stops to retrieve his reproductive slaves? Having rock musicians playing during attacks made it seem like the villains weren't taking the situation seriously and it made no sense to me. If the filmmaker wanted to include live musicians, featuring an electric guitar, that would've been fine, if he'd/she'd explained/showed how the guitar was powered and why having music played was important to the villain and his posse. Just having it there, hanging in the story, forced my attention to it and not the story. I'm giving the film a 3 because of the acting and because some of the behavior shown by the power characters seemed believable, and the control dynamic surrounding the limited resource water and how the leader controlled the poor, nearly starving populace, by restricting water and food, that part felt believable. The writer and director had some powerful truths here but didn't present (polish) them for maximum effect. Instead of showing Furiousa as she sneakily escapes and expecting the audience to get behind her (even though initially it wasn't clear what she was doing or why, as she wasn't saying), I think the story should've provided more information about her so that we could connect to her emotionally in act one. That didn't happen and though I watched her because Charlize Theron is playing the part and she's a star and obviously when a star in her prime is playing a character, that's usually an important character in a film, I think the filmmakers relied more on Ms. Theron's stardom in giving people the information that Furiousa is an important character, rather than creating a sympathetic and understandable character in the writing. Still, decent story because of the acting and because of the limited resource, power dynamic truths. A solid act one (where we're attached to Furiosa), and also less fantastical stunts, and this film could've potentially been outstanding. As presented, even with it's flaws, it's not too bad. At least it's ambitious. Just needed to rethink act I, and take the car stunts down a notch (or at least show give some explanation for how Furious and Max could take a licking and keep on functioning to the extent they managed).",1448064000,2,4433,4.926470588235294

7226594,5,B00YQJRYGY,"One action-packed thrill ride. An adrenaline inducing special-effects laden no holds bar entertainment. A brilliant futuristic mastery. A solid film that bleeds for attention and deserves every bit of it. Wild, tense, comical, brutal action packed perfection. A fun ride.

The characters are what makes it stand out. Truly brilliant in all their twisted, disturbing, crazy, asinine realities. Tom Hardy is the very definition of Mad Max. Hardy is a dynamic actor that can play any type of character. He brings them to life. He breathes life into each persona and Mad Max is no different. He owns this movie right along with the utterly fantastic, and extraordinary talented Charlize Theron. They are pure cinema. The chemistry and acting by both, bring out the best in the art form of acting, and creating memorable moments in cinema.

Both are utterly bad ass in this film. Both are butt kicking action stars. The visionary imagination by Miller is what storytelling is all about. I've been a fan of Mad Max my whole life. It's one of the very first movies I ever saw. Mad Max, The Road Warrior, and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Each one has a different style. A different futuristic expertise. Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best sequels or remakes, whatever you want to call it; it's bloody brilliant.

This stars Hugh Keays-Byrne as the leader and kick ass villain, Immorton Joe. Now he is a flawless performer, and what makes it all the more entertaining, and magical is he was in the original 1979 classic, Mad Max, as the character Toecutter.

I think two of the shining stars have to go to Nicholas Hoult and Josh Helman. The characters of Nux and Slit are priceless. Hoult was ridiculously perfect. I think that is what stands out the most about this film. All the performances where spot on and utterly fantastic.

The clincher that brings this film into the realm of excellence is the man behind it. The original creator of the original trilogy, George Miller came back and wrote, produced, and directed. And boy did he showcase the brilliance of his imagination to further this wild journey of a future world. Miller is an amazing visionary and director. He has captured many pieces of cinema that leave the viewer with a satisfied experience.

Mad Max: Fury Road is the very essence of thrill ride, action and truly an imaginative means of pure entertainment.

NOPE! I am a fan of the original Mad Max trilogy and this barely touches the greatness of those films. I am not an elitist and I am open to remakes if they are done well.... but this was just a rushed, sad, little movie in my honest opinion. What is Hollywood thinking by releasing this stuff? Have we dumbed down that much??? I didn't find this even mildly entertaining.",1447804800,,468,4.318181818181818

7226636,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This isn't a remake like so many other movies lately. This is another story that has Mad Max as a character, and not even the main one, doing things in his world that we have become accustomed to. It has the same kind of frantic feel associated with the franchise, adding to the crazy mad instead of the angry mad. The cars are great again though like usual to little of the supercharged beauty, and if you liked the really long chase scene then this is for you (defiantly for me). I heard someone refer to it as a very long Coyote and Road Runner style movie and I have say they were not far off.",1447718400,,597,4.155172413793103

7226638,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Whether you're a Mad Max virgin or a fan of the original films, this film is can't miss.  It reaches and, dare I say, exceeds the bar set by Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior).  Hardy is more than a worthy successor to Gibson and Theron turns in an Oscar-Worthy performance.

Fury Road presents something that might, with a large stretch of the imagination, might seem like an updated view into the Max world but which is so far removed as to be impossible to enjoy.  The action is boring, which really robs from the film as its essentially just supposed to be on long action sequence.  Things blow up and cars tumble but its all digitally enhanced sequences that lack any sense of reality.  The characters are wooden. The plot isn't developed.  The storyline is, at times, hard to follow.  What you get is a lot of visuals and they aren't always coherent.

If you like the franchise, I'd advise to avoid this and accept that the Mad Max adventures ended with Thunderdome.",1447286400,,792,4.535211267605634

7226734,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Have you ever noticed that people who give a movie one star give no more than just one meaningless sentence on how they hate the movie? If you hate it, then please explain why you found the movie to be so disagreeable with what you're expectations were.

Now that I said that....here's my review of the movie, not the Blu-ray.

If you've have ever seen great trailers, that were only leading to the great disappointment of the actual film, this isn't it. I could say that any given 5 minutes of the film could have been in the trailer. The movie not only succeeded in keeping the high energy throughout the film, but didn't in anyway make it boring, or exhausting. I seriously had to reflect on that. There's so much action, going on that you'd think you'd get tired of it, but it's the amazing energy that keeps the film exciting without having redundant cliffhangers. If you've ever seen Back to the Future II you'll know what I mean. Sometimes in movies they'll create dumb situations just so the action continues, but Mad Max has none of that. There's a continual changing of events that on many times had made me react ""HOLY S***!"" All this, and visually a stunning movie made this one of my all time favorite movies.

Easter egg.

The main villain in Mad Max:Fury Road, is the same actor who played the villain in The original Mad Max.",1447113600,2,1341,4.506172839506172
7226735,4,B00YQJRYGY,"It was even more enjoyable the second time I saw it.  The nostalgic side to me wanted to see something more closely related to the classics.  I guess its kind of like holding on to a decade that you enjoyed in life, like the 60's, 70's, and etc. The truth of the matter is that life moves on and these guys did well at not falling into the mold of the old but made something new and different.  They do have small little bites and hints that made  the kids who grew up on the Road Warrior laugh which was appreciated.  Again I got past the wishing and wanting to live in the past and accepted the new Mad Max and found it pretty damn good.",1447113600,2,639,4.0396825396825395

7226752,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The film Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), stars Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy in this visually pleasing film and reboot of the hit 1980s film. While, I am a huge movie watcher, I could go to the movie theater every single day of my life. It has been a very long time since I have been completely captivated by a film especially one that is filled with action and adventure, I am more of a romantic comedy kind of person. The director, George Miller does an impeccable job of filming in landscape view the entire time, it makes the film even more visually pleasing. In the film, the setting is a very simple backdrop of the desert, with sand storms and sweltering heat that you can almost feel from your seat. The setting is supposed to resemble a post apocalyptic wasteland, where water and gasoline are both scarce resources. This is because the people left have survived a nuclear holocaust, completely wiping out society and the land. Hardy and Theron have outstanding chemistry in this post apocalyptic action thriller, in which they run away from Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the tyrannical leader in the film.
After Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) escapes from the Citadel after he has been imprisoned and used as a blood donor to one of the War Boys (tyrannical leader Joes Army), Nux (Nicholas Hoult). He runs into Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Joes wives that include The Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley), Toast The Knowing (Zoe Kravitz), Capable (Riley Keough), The Dag (Abbey Lee), and Cheedo The Fragile (Courtney Eaton). Furiosa has taken, in order to save them from the tyrannical leader who has chosen his wives as the only ones to reproduce. Mad Max: Fury Road is excellent for people who enjoy feminist themes in a movie, because there are plenty of points where Thereon is leading in the film. Throughout the entire movie, Max and Furiosa along with Joes wives are on the run from the tyrannical leader and his army of bloodthirsty soldiers. The majority of scenes are filmed on the move, as the War Boys hang off of vehicles that are chasing after Furiosas War Rig. The most outstanding and pleasing visual scene, I have ever seen is when the War Boys, Max, Furiosa and Joes wives drive into a sandstorm. All of them are in separate cars, being thrown around in a storm that resembles the entrance to hell. This is when Nux (Nicholas Hoult) makes his debut in the film, as a crazy War Boy who accepts dying for his leader, Immortan Joe. Instead of dying, he is the only War Boy to keep pursuing Furiosa after the sandstorm, but loses his blood donor which is Max. This is when Max and Furiosa with the wives, join together in the pursuit of the Green Place which is the utopian refuge with endless amounts of water and green space. As the film continues it keeps you locked on the plot. I don't want to give away anymore plot, so you must watch.",1447027200,,2881,4.650980392156863

7226767,4,B00YQJRYGY,"First off, every rumor you've heard about his movie being a two-hour car chase is entirely true.  Go in expecting a simple plot and that's all the setup you'll need.  From that perspective, it feels a bit like a diet soda: you're *almost* satisfied with the flavor.

But that being said, what's good about this movie?

The environments and camera work are excellent.  The characters are well-rounded and those that matter are provided with just enough exposition to make you care.  The world itself has had some thought and love put into it to make it more cohesive; the setting is perhaps the best character in the movie.

Then, of course, there's the driving and stunt scenes.  Certainly, there's CGI; but it's kept to enhancements rather than being the main show, and this pays dividends for a movie that just feels classic.

Tom Hardy doesn't get many lines, but he does a great job in the role.  Charlize Theron also delivers an excellent performance as Furiosa.

Highly recommended watch for those who like blood and guts, action, and car chases all in the mix.",1447027200,,1067,4.744565217391305

Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are both fantastic, as is Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast. Furious is one of my all-time favorite female characters, because she's a pure badass. They also didn't force a romance into the plot, which I appreciated since there really wasn't time for it. The world and society building was intriguing, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time (I saw it four times in the theater).

It's really great acting across the board, the visuals are amazing, and the music is just intense.
The story itself would either take place between the first and second one of the originals, but definitely not a prequal.
I like to think of it as a reboot.
There was a great use of music and sound to really go along with the movie and the story.
The one downside was I would get a sense of Bane every now and then when Tom Hardy would talk (which was not very often)
Even though its an R rated film I would say this is good for teenagers too.

If you are a Tom Hardy fan, just know he plays the tittle character but for much of the movie, if not, all of it, he supports Charlize's Furiosa. If you will be mad about that, don't watch the movie.

About 15 minutes in, I thought the rental was a huge mistake: it just seemed stupid and hard to follow.  We stuck with it and it largely redeemed itself.

7226834,5,B00YQJRYGY,A movie that plays out like a fever dream in all the best ways. Only George Miller has the audacity to put such a visual spectacle on screen with all the risks such over the top film-making entails. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron command the screen while Nicholas Hoult does maybe his best and most inspired acting to date. What a delight!,1446768000,,338,4.467741935483871

7226840,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I've watched Mad Max since it first came out years ago (1979).  That was a great movie.  This, however, is nothing like it or as good.  Tom Hardy plays an okay character but this is hardly an 8/10 movie.  In fact, to call this even a 5 out of 10 would be giving it credit that it did not earn.

Max isn't even the star of this movie.  That honor splits between Charlize Theron and the truck.  Too bad.  I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  I was also really disappointed with most of it.

If you've got a couple hours to wile away, this is an okay way to do it. But don't expect anything as good as either Mad Max or Mad Max 2, The  Road Warrior.  As long as you keep that in mind, this will work for you.",1446681600,,722,3.9375

There's a lot to be said for narration without words, and this movie has so much of it. George Miller may have waited the time I've been on the planet to make a sequel, but dang was the wait worth it. Tom Hardy was great as Max to take the helm from Gibson, Charlize Theron a strong and more than capable badass, and Nicholas Hoult as a confused but eager Nux. The action was amazing and such a visual treat. The fact that essentially the ENTIRE movie was pure stunt work and not CGI made this girl giddy (I am a lover of traditional FX/stunt works) with delight. It gets a little long in the last 1/4, but again, still totally worth it. The streaming quality on our rental was great, didn't have any issues.",1446681600,,875,4.12280701754386

7226972,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I was very excited to see this in the theatre, but somehow missed it due to my busy schedule.  Going into it, I wanted to already give it a 5-star rating due to the hype from other people I know who saw it, as well as an anticipated addition to George Miller's awesome Mad Max series.  By the end of the film, I had to say the movie did not live up to the hype.  Not to say it was bad by any means.  The visuals alone were worth a 5.  Even at 2 hours runtime, I thought they could have tacked on another half hour or more to get more backstory on (Joe, Furiosa, and Nux).  I believe that would have pushed it into the 5-star territory.  I will say it is very refreshing to see such a strong female character in a major Hollywood production in a world (both in real life and this film) dominated by males.  I would like to see a spinoff film starring Charlize Therone as her Furiosa character.  Maybe even a prequel to this film.  I just think there could have been a lot of exploration of Joe's character and his rise to power.  I wanted more exposition on his various programs (breeder, hydroponics, blood bank) and his control of the water.  Plus, where did he come from and how did he get here and develop the above programs?

3 for the story (or maybe lack of more needed story)
5 for visuals (wow, wow, WOW)
4 overall.  I wouldn't say it's a must see film, but if you like adventure,sci-fi, and cars, cars, cars, you should really enjoy this film.",1446249600,,1452,4.176258992805756

In a nutshell, this movie is mainly a huge chase sequence with dynamic stunts, violent crashes and loud explosions.  The dialogue and plot are hard to follow.

7226979,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I liked this movie but probably should have given it 3 stars instead of 4 because of the way they portrayed Max... They really steered away from the traditional Mad Max as the person he was... I can get / understand that... Yet... This movie seemed to be actually more about the lady driver with one hand (I forgot her name - sorry) as the star instead of Max. It's as if they just used ""Mad Max"" in the title to draw the audience of the the older Mel Gibson films... Anyway... This was still a pretty good flick... Plenty of action and special effects.

Would I recommend this movie??? Yes - BUT with a warning... If you are going to watch because you are a fan of the older movies, you will be let down to some degrees... However... If you can put you expectations of the Mel Gibson days behind you and watch with an open mind, you will note the familiarity and enjoy it...",1446249600,,875,4.2395209580838324
7226980,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Spoiler alert.  This review contains comments about the movie's plot and conclusion.  The original ""Road Warrior"" was one of my favorite movies.  While it had non-stop action, you cared for Mel Gibson's character, and for the people he was trying to help.  Mad Max Fury Road cuts right to the chase.  Literally.  Fury Road is one long chase scene. Furiosa (Charlize Thereon) is driving a battlewagon (the vehicles are the real stars of this movie-along with the stunt men), in which she has managed to secret the entire unwilling harem of Immortal Joe, the leader of the post-apocalyptic War Boys Tribe.  Max (Tom Hardy making do with about seven words of dialog) has been captured by the War Boys and is forced to be a part of the chase to capture the battlewagon as a ""blood bag"".  Don't ask.  You'll have to see the movie. Max escapes and joins forces with Thereon as they are chased and attacked across the limitless desert.  When they get to Thereons destination, theres nothing there.  So they get chased all the way back to War Boys Town.  Thereon becomes the new leader.  Max?  After carefully establishing that there is nothing out there except more desert,  Max gives a little salute and rides (walks actually) into the sunset.  If you like action and incredible vehicle stunts, you will like this movie.  If you like snappy dialog, fleshed-out characters, and something that resembles a plot, don't bother",1446249600,10,1416,4.809128630705394

This is a real movie that knows what it wants and has an artistic vision. The vision is chaos and what it wants is madness. A great sequel to the equally revolutionary Road Warrior movie.

The musical score and the cinematography are well done, the latter being beautifully stunning and vibrant with rich hues of orange, rust and dreamy blues.

7227034,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Excellent Movie. One of the best action movies you will ever see. It is basically non-stop action. Nearly flawless and 100% action, except for a 15minute lull in the middle. The lull is actually quite noticeable upon second and third viewing and doesn't seem to fit the movie at all and does take away from the whole result. Without this lull, and if they had replaced it with another 10-15 mins of action, it may have been the best movie of all time. The movie has received incredible reviews for the action, and it is fully deserved. It has received some criticism for being too feministic in the end and I believe the criticism is a bit warranted. Max is the only male, in the cast of all females/the 'good guys' at the very end that survive and 'win'...and 100% of the wicked/bad guys who 'loose' are men. Nothing against women, but this was the only far fetched part of the movie. Everything else seemed 'realistic', that is, for a high octane post-apocalyptic movie. All the chases and explosions and stunts were realistic and not 'fast & furious' over the top impossible. But the end of the movie did noticeably push a bit of a feminist agenda. I am not against women, I just don't like movies with alternate motives, it takes away from the story. That being said, Theron, as Furiosa is EXCELLENT!  4.89 Stars!",1445990400,,1317,4.580508474576271
7227035,2,B00YQJRYGY,"The original Mad Max was a low budget road race movie with a few stunts but a relatively strong plot due to the death of Max' wife and child (OK, I know she didn't die but the coma she was in didn't look good). Mad Max 2 was more about the wasteland but again strongly featured Max and still had that low budget Australian style. MM 3 had Hollywood written all over it: Epic sets, weird fight scenes, big stars, no plot, etc. It killed the franchise for a long time. Now we have Fury Road. This is even worse than Thunderdome. Sure there are a lot of road race stunts but they are there for their own sake rather than to move the story along. They aren't even very original as a quick review of Road Warrior, Mad Max and Thunderdome all show elements of each stunt. Good grief there's even a monster truck! How Hollywood is that! The plot is as weak as ever and the acting poor. What is worse is that there is no Max. He shows up but this is really ""Mildly Miffed Maxine"" rather than Mad Max. Once again Hollywood kills the Mad Max franchise; please let it die properly this time.",1445990400,,1080,4.197115384615385

The real star of this movie, the real hero is Fury - a one armed woman with a prosthetic arm that's very powerful, but does come off sometimes. So this movie has a disabled female hero. Differently abled actually - you would NOT want to cross Fury! Or run into her in a dark alley being a jerk. She's awesome. This movie has all the fun machines, chases, grunge and constant action, but sends a much better message!",1445904000,,553,4.326923076923077

7227065,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I am a fan of many elements of this movie. I really like Charlize Theron and the idea of strong kick-ass female leads. I love larger than life action movies with spectacular scenery. I enjoy post-apocalyptic stories. I really wanted to like this movie but it left me mostly bored and confused. It was just one never-ending chase scene that didn't have together well. There is a thin plot here but its barely developed or explained. I felt like the script was written by a 12 year old boy who was more interested in creating excuses to blow up, crash, or otherwise destroy improbably customized monster vehicles. The story felt disjointed and jumpy, with little or no explanation of the purpose or origin of of many characters. We often could not even understand parts of the dialogue, even after rewinding and listening to the words again. I really like the original Mad Max, and wanted to give this movie a chance. I should know better by now than to think any of these endless sequels that keep coming out to old classics will be any good.",1445904000,,1041,4.602150537634409
7227066,2,B00YQJRYGY,"After months of anticipation, I finally got around to seeing this movie. And honestly? It left me underwhelmed. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the music is pretty amazing. But the story? What happened to it. It hardly develops. Other than making it apparent that CT is trying to free the women, it falls short of anything remotely close to explaining what is going on. Even the minimalist John Wick revealed more about it's characters and the story. Mad Max just kind of throws you into the movie and expects that the action is enough to make you care to follow. For some that's probably ok. I'm more of a Kill Bill/The Raid/The Warriors type of action person (story, style). Mad Max looks cool, but it was definitely forgettable to me. Thankfully I redbox-ed it rather than buying it.",1445904000,,800,4.762589928057554

Every look in her eye was dead on. She is vulnerable (as max once was, but now more of a mindless thug) and you felt for her. So pay attention to the cover and watch the girl. Wish there was a bit more closure. Amazing movie.",1445644800,,587,4.25

The characters are rich and varied with just enough told to peak your interest. Sadly some people are not secure enough to admit they loved that the side characters were so interesting. If you knit pick you can find anything wrong with anything. For myself I was content to enjoy this thrill ride and get captured into the storytelling.",1445040000,2,457,4.7974683544303796

As great as the movie is, the bonus material of how they made the movie is just as thrilling.  Everything human beings do in the movie was actually done by human beings, up to filming the chase scenes in real time.  This movie, for me, completely erases the three movies that come before- this is what MAD MAX looks like and means to me now.",1445040000,,479,4.348314606741573

This movie is always on the movie, with a few exceptions, it's kinda like if the movie Speed smoked crack.  It was really well thought out and executed.

7227321,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Wow, I considered going to see this in the theaters but am so glad I waited for the video.  This was bad, the only good that you might say it had in it was special effects except even that was boring because of the over kill and ridiculous that they live and the others die.

I loved Mad Max, all the first three which were different for differing reasons, but this had nothing, no plot, no reason, no reality, no understanding, it was definitely different than those.  It was 2 hours of pretty much a truck chase one direction and then a truck race the other direction with unbelievable saves, over, and over, right to the end.

I laughed at a lot of idiotic scenes though, it was hard not to.  I thought Jupiter Rising was not so good, this was way beyond that worse.  That was actually good in comparison.

Give me Captain America, Iron Man, or the Avengers, any day, this just reeked... badly.  I kept wondering when the story would start, some reason, it never did.",1445040000,,970,4.379888268156424

But as Fury Road progressed, I just accepted on it's own terms and found myself really enjoying it. The sets, costumes, cars are all wonderfully ridiculous, imaginative and fun.

The actual plot of Mad Max helping the innocent madens was not bad and had several touching moments to it.  The special effects were not as good as I hope they were going to be for a modern update to an old classic, but then again maybe it's just something I should expect from a Mad Max film.

7227432,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max Fury Road is my favorite movie released this year. Just from the production quality and the story telling, one must respect this film. This is not your average action movie.
George Miller Does an excellent job telling his story and (unlike many other filmmakers) doesn't treat his audience as idiots. He lets us figure out what certain things mean and doesn't shove a bunch of needless exposition down our throats. The sheer amount of world-building is incredible, and even though the subtext isn't explained to us, we understand what's going on.
I honestly feel like those who don't enjoy this movie have grown accustomed to not having to pay close attention and figuring out what certain details mean for themselves.

It's a video game on the big screen with waaaay overdone computer graphics that are flat out not that good and even less believable are the situations they force them into. The plot, even for a Max movie, is BAD. Childishly written and poorly performed. I am not even sure who is the star in this show. Max seems to be nearly mute and the female performer actually has a larger part in this catastrophe than HIM!! They robbed the previous movies for similar characters and some kind of relativity that would make it seem like a Mad Max movie. It all failed.

Immortan Joe sends Furiosa on an anual run to get supplies from Bullet Farm and Gas Town. What Immortan Joe does not know is that Furiosa is taking Immortan Joe's breeders with her to a safe place referred to in the movie as ""The Green Place."" In a rage Immortan sends out all of his Warboys and calls for the  Gas Towners and Bullet Farmers to come to his aid in catching this Furiosa. Max has been captured by these Warboys and labeled as a universal blood donor. When a sick war boy by the name of Nux is unable to drive he gets his bloodbag (Max) strapped to the front of his car, pumping blood into his body while they catch Furiosa. It is then an all out chase and I don't want to spoil the rest!!

This movie is definitely worth buying as it is a great movie to watch with friends as it is 100% action and easy to follow while talking. Furiosa steals the show in this movie. The movie as a whole has quite the feminist feel which is really fun to watch. Max does not say much so do not expect some gripping dialogue that makes you rethink everything.

This is action so good it simply defies the status quo, managing to surpass the cultural boundary of the cheesy action movie straight into classic piece of cinema.

I mean where is the story? They start at one end of the road and travel to the other end and then return to their original starting point while being chased by the same group of bad guys the whole time. They lose people on the way out and on the way back in. At least the originals with Mel Gibson tried to tell a story. Also Mel Gibson played Mad Max much better than Tom Hardy could ever hope to.

7227538,2,B00YQJRYGY,"They should not have called this movie Mad Max, they should have called it ""Charlize Theron's movie"". Because Mad Max, although he was in every seen practically after about 30 minutes anyway, barely spoke at all which wasn't unusual for this character, however the movie revolved almost entirely around Charlize Theron character which was very disappointing to me. I believe that Tom Hardy could act in anything he does and do it with brilliance and style and he did not disappoint at all in this one. I just think it was a choice of the writers to make it more about the female lead and it was more of a female empowerment movie. It was not about Mad Max at all, really. If you are going in thinking that it is a remake of the original Mad Max, you will be terribly disappointed. There are some cool special effects and some really super awesome stunt work but overall the storyline was really kind of dumb. The original Mad Max was by far better! And frankly, I think if Charlize Theron had been more in the background and Tom Hardy in the foreground, it would have made for a far more exciting movie.",1444435200,,1103,4.465346534653466

Don't get me wrong, this movie has a lot of action and it's almost non-stop action and it has some pretty good ""scenery"" if your a guy or a bi girl. However, that's about all it has. The plot is mediocre (won't reveal it here for spoiler reasons and others have already posted the plot) and if you are like me and you analyze situations in movies, the actions of the bad guys are some times ridiculous. For example, fuel is very limited in the movie yet when the bad guys are chasing Max, there is a vehicle with a guy playing a guitar that spews flaming gas out of the end of the guitar. I kid you not. He serves no other purpose other than to play the guitar and spew flaming gas out of the end of it.",1444348800,,790,3.9748427672955975

7227690,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Real boring and monotonous is my best description.  I have always liked Mad Max movies since Mel Gibson made them, and I guess they were real low budget. but had a certain character with Mel in them.  I am sure a lot of money was spent on these, and the stars are decent enough in other movies.  Maybe the problem was chemistry of the actors as well as the script.  My wife and I forced ourselves to finish it since we had paid for them.  If they had been on Amazon Prime, I doubt that we would have finished it like very many of the Amazon Prime movies of similar quality.",1444176000,,573,4.126126126126126

7227704,5,B00YQJRYGY,"What can i add, earlier reviewers have by and large said it all......
'Max' (Tom Hardy) who's one aim in life is to survive starts out as a prisoner of the Citadel in this adventure......
'Imperator Furiosa' (Charlize Theron) supposedly on a Citadel Mission has 5 woman on-board her rig, her
intent is to rescue them from the claws of the Citadel Masters and take them to her 'Green' homeland she'd
been captured from as a child.
'The Citadel leader 'Immortan Joe' (Hugh Keayes-Byrne) and a significant force are in pursuit, 'Max' is chained
to the front of one of the following assault vehicles, in effect, a human battering ram.
'Max' a man of few words, haunted by the loss of his wife and child is in effect a loner, however he joins up with
''Furiosa'' and her charges and after a wary beginning will help battle her pursuers.
This a new beginning for 'Mad Max' a role made famous in the late 70's into the 80's of course by 'Mel Gibson'...
but, make no mistake, this is not a re-make, it's a re-invention of the role.
It's fast moving with wall to wall action throughout, not one you'll want to miss.
(kinda wish i'd opted for the 3-D version)

This installment:  awesome story, not so easily second guessed, and a great cinematography - I watched it on a tablet on an airplane with a great headset.  The sound and film scrore coupled to very real sets unfortunately rocked, and I kicked the sit in front of me repeatedly, requiring that I finish watching the flick duct taped to my seat.

7227753,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max Fury Road is exactly what is wrong with Hollywood today. All flash, no story, tons of C.G.I, and it's called a movie.
The movie starts off teasing that this is going to be a real sequel to Mad Max, but quickly descends into nothing more than a chase scene. Charlize Theron is the only saving grace for this movie.

Tom hardy does a descent job of playing Mad Max, but in one particular scene he completely forgets his gravel like voice and talks normally. This breaks immersion. And that's not the only scene that breaks immersion.

****SPOILERS AHEAD****

In multiple scenes people catch up to the Semi-Truck by literally just running/walking towards it. This is after Max takes off full pedal to the metal. It's absurd beyond belief and had myself shaking my head and laughing. There are other scenes where these girls show up called Breeders (how original) and they look like supermodel's in the middle of the wasteland, while everyone else has a gritty look to them, again completely breaking immersion. The story is non-existent and how this got approved is beyond me. The ENTIRE MOVIE is just an escort mission. There is nothing else to this movie. There is no character development, you aren't invested about what happens to said characters, and towards the end of the movie someone says ""there is plenty of water and vegetation here"" which goes against the very next scene which shows NO vegetation at all.  It also self defeats the purpose of bringing seeds back to the location.

**** END OF SPOILERS****

It is the year 2015, and to release a movie like this with no story, no character development, poor C.G.I effects (looks like a 6year old made them) and have the gull to call this a Mad Max movie is insulting to the previous and superior versions of this franchise.
While there are cool parts in the movie here and there, it does not make up for the sheer laziness on the directors/producers part for this movie. It insults the view to such a degree that words alone can not describe the feeling you have after watching this mess.
Half-way through the movie I was asking myself ""How much more of this trash is left?"" and I could not wait until it was over.
The ending was extremely sub-par, and left the viewer scratching their head as to if that was all there was.

These Hollywood remakes/reboots are pure garbage, Robocop, Total Recall, & Mad Max Fury Road. Newsflash Hollywood, re-writing these movies, and throwing C.G.I at remakes/reboots does not a good movie make. There is a reason why the older movies still hold up today, and it has nothing to do with making it look ""better"" with C.G.I.

If you are a fan of Mad Max, do not buy this trash. Do NOT support movies like this, or we'll see more of these types of films where story won't matter and it will be all about the C.G.I effects and explosions.",1444176000,,2834,4.598019801980198

7227844,3,B00YQJRYGY,"The problem with Mad Max Fury Road is a few things;  Aside from the random hallucinations and muddy backstory, the movie isn't about Max at all.  And I wanted it to be.  The fact that he's in the story is extremely incidental.  Tom Hardy barely speaks throughout this entire movie.  And when he does, it sounds like a voice over or it sounds like he's never spoken English, let alone an Australian accent.  This is not Mad Max, its a movie within that world perhaps, but there's really something missing here.  It would've been better to call this movie Mad Maxine and let Charlize Theron claim to be Max's sister and leave Max out of the picture completely.  I mean, if they would've provided a bit more backstory for Max, it might have helped.  But instead, we get a 3 min intro that is so shallow and bereft of originality that it just looks amateurish.  'OOOh, hes been out there soo long that he's become a primal man with long hair and he eats a lizard, oooooh.  He's so primal he doesn't talk much.... but he still drives a car.'  give me a break already!",1444176000,,1062,4.38974358974359
7227845,1,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie was horrible! Essentially, old white guys rule a dystopian world in which people have time and resources to find really old cars and soup them up in creative and labor intensive ways. The essential premise of the movie is one old white guy sends a petite hairless woman to drive a truck to get fuel but instead she's stealing his harem to return to her native lands. For me the biggest disappointment is how little the movie was about Max. He was almost a supporting character in this film.

There were a lot little moments in the movie that were inspired by the original ""Road Warrior"" movie but aside from that, it's 2 hours of car chases in the desert.

If you're someone that has trouble with ""suspension of disbelief"" you're not going to enjoy this movie. If you're not a critical movie viewer who isn't bothered by things like continuity and story and you enjoy car chases in the desert, you'll probably really enjoy this film.",1444176000,5,944,4.579881656804734

I am going to have to watch it again to take it all in.  Very well filmed with plenty of real action.  It is a strange world in the movie but very well done.

Max (played by Tom Hardy) was a weak character played by an uninteresting actor. When Max occasionally did speak, it sounded like a generic male voice in a low-budget, dubbed Franco-Italian film. If you don't know what I mean, you're lucky!

Boy, was IMDB wrong.

I wanted to scrape the memory of this movie out of my mind after I saw it.  It was everything wrong with movies today IMO.

  Put it this way... Before the movie started we were cuddled up on the couch, cold with covers over us in a house that was at around 68 degrees. By the end of the movie we had the covers off of us and i was sweating to the point to were i kept blowing on my naked feet. I actually started yelling at my wife asking her why she turned the heat on in the house?!!! She answered ""I never touched the heat!"". Turns out the house was at the same temperature as it was when the movie started!  We both quickly realized that this movie literally was so intense, with so much ""on the edge of your seat action"", that it literally had our hearts beating so dang fast it made us both sweat! NO FREAKIN JOKE!!! WE HAVE NEVER EVER had a movie do this to us before, and we watch atleast 1-3 movies a week for the past 15 years since we been together!

  All i gotta say is be prepared for a ride! Awesome story, awesome acting, and unlike other hero movies, the good-guys actually get hurt in this film (and even worse!).  Can't wait for a sequel, i am kicking myself right now that i passed this up while it was in the theater, this won't happen with Waistland (the sequel)! My 3D BlueRay is on order come payday! :)

7227900,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I am a fan of the original Mad Max movies and the unique view of a post-apocalyptic world it shows.  So I was interesting in seeing an updated sequel of the original series.  The scenery and the special effects are beautifully done with giving the feel of the original movies.  The stunts and action sequences are also well done.  This movie is all non-stop action which is normally not an issue with me but in this case, there is very little substance or story to go with the action.  This is basically one long non-stop car chase with very little character development or interaction.  With that the movie seemed to drag along because the constant chase got a little old after a while.  I also found the various accents at times difficult to understand in the drone of noise and music.  The whole rock guitar thing on a car thing through the whole chase seemed a bit silly at times.

Action wise this does well but to me isn't as good as the original Mad Max movies.

7227910,5,B00YQJRYGY,"An epic film of a ground breaking nature in more ways than one. A morality tale of patriarchy gone extreme and how it affects both men and women in a negative way. Anyone criticizing this film is only doing so because it criticizes the power structure in our present society that this story reflects and that they derive benefit from, male privilege.

Fury Road is not a diversion from the films that came before it. On one level it parallels the story in Beyond Thunderdome where Max is also enslaved to shovel pig crap and pitted against Master Blaster for the benefit of Aunty Entity the Matriarch ruler of Bartertown. The difference being this time, in Fury Road, Mad Max helps the rebel Furiosa overcome the Patriarch ex-military tyrant Immortan Joe and establish a more free and equitable society where women are not breeder slaves, and men are not mere war fodder brainwashed into suicidal self destruction.

In short both men and women are set free in this chapter of Mad Max.

This film also features revolutionary custom cars beyond anything ever seen before in any car culture magazines or films.

Also anyone concerned that this film may depict disturbing abuse and torture can rest easy to a degree. No women are presented being sexually assaulted or tortured in Fury Road, run over or shot, yes, raped, no. Instead it is Mad Max who is assaulted, beaten, branded, tattooed and bound and muzzled and used as blood fuel for Immortan Joes War Boys, most of which occurs in the first few minutes of the film.

Definitely not for children as I would expect a serious potential for nightmares, but a must see for the rest of humanity as it is a serious wake up call to all of us. It is about the tyranny of Patriarchal rule as well as the dangers of belief systems. Go watch it!",1443916800,,1786,4.60377358490566

7227927,2,B00YQJRYGY,"In a nutshell, the movie is one big car chase with predominately ridiculous looking vehicles, pasty bald cult crazies, a group of women, and the minor character of Max thrown in to allow the movie to be weakly tied to some much better films from years past. You will know almost instantly which characters will die, and what the ending will be. Physics and mechanics are ignored completely. Max's Interceptor, which was almost a character in its own right in the previous films, was removed early on. Yes, the acting and visuals are fine, but that is not enough to carry the movie...it was extremely disappointing to my entire family. As an FYI, I am 46 and saw the rest of the franchise as they came out, so I am looking at this movie in the context of what the original story was, and the timeframe in which they were released. This feels very much like someone trying to make an art film based on his ""interpretation"" of a character...not a continuation of an existing story.",1443916800,10,978,4.5625

I was, however, pleasantly surprised.

The acting and story doesn't do anything revolutionary, but going into this movie you should know first and foremost that it's an action movie. And instead of settling for B-rate action and B-rate story, go for something like Fury Road where the action takes precedence, and the story takes a backseat to this wild ride of a movie.

For fans of Mad Max, you could consider this movie to almost be a crazy, high-production-value remake of the 3rd act of Road Warrior, for what it's worth. Highly recommended!",1443830400,,854,5.049645390070922

I've been addicted to the film score, by Tom Holkenborg, from a month before the film even came out in theaters (and I'm listening to it again now as I write this post). Buy it if you love film scores!!!

Also, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is truly one if the most visually dense films I've ever enjoyed studying at depth. I discover something new every time I watch it. Soooooooo...if you haven't seen MAD MAX: FURY ROAD do your mad-mental-side a favor and dive deep into its operatic, juicy, explosive goodness. 3:)

Make no mistake, the story is set in a world dominated by furiously territorial, tribal males, paternalistic absolutism abounds. Conflict is violent and immediate. But there is hope embedded in this journey story, manifested by Furiosa and falling water.

Technically, the film is wondrous to watch. The spectacular explosions aside, the moving vehicles (think cars on steriods) and the stunts are imaginative and elaborate. There were some scenes so outrageous it was difficult to grasp that they were stunts, not special effects. No matter how careful the professionals were as these scenes were rehearsed and filmed, there was real risk involved in their execution.

7228004,1,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie was interesting because you have to wonder why it was even made.  This is the thin plot line, a bunch of people and vehicles drive for about 2 hours non-stop into the wasteland, that's about it. The scenery was unique, the vehicles were fantastic, some good CG and that is about the whole of the movie.  Mel's MM were better acted, good story line and fun, this movie lacked fun. Charlie Therone could be replaced with any actress, perhaps even a sock puppet, maybe Kermit the frog.

The action sequences (pretty much the whole film) were as good as I've ever seen.  Charlize Theron adds another great performance to her resume.  The whole cast was strong actually.  Definitely a movie to see more than once to really catch everything that is happening.  Hopefully, the world doesn't come to that, but water may end up being the great issue eventually (as it already is in many places).

Tom Hardy is a decent actor, and proves it here again, Oh and Charlize is hot (as usual, at least in my eye's mind), even though she is missing a arm. she again proves there is no role she won't tackle and make it Her's. this move has great effects and a bundle full of weirdly effective characters.

Explosions, lots of shooting things, very justifiably angry women taking their fate into their own hands. Fantastic action movie and doesn't use female characters as props rather than people.

The mythology seemed like a natural continuation of the previous movies (though I admit I haven't managed to watch Thunderdome yet), in that the stories keep getting bigger and more impressive. Max, as in Road Warrior, is not a catalyst or hero as much as a convenient person to be talked(/bribed/tricked) into helping with a mission already in action.

Little plot deveiopment, and most of the characters were poorly developed, uninteresting and hard to develop much empathy with.  The violence/action adventure was non-stop, over the top, like the screenwriter and director wrote while on speed.  Kind of typical of the action movies designed for 14-18 year old boys or thsoe who never grew past that stage.  The first Mad max seried with Mel Gibson was much better.  There was a certain amount of entertainment in that series in an underlying campiness that is missing here.

Me?  Not so much.  Sure, I love that the women were bad-ass but I really did not get attached to any of the characters.  I thought the plot and the resolution were both way, way over-simplified.  I wasn't bored, but I could have spent my time doing almost anything else and been more entertained/intrigued than this movie did for me.

7228148,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I'd heard so much hype about this movie, I was afraid there was no way it could live up to my expectations. Well, fortunately, it mostly did. This is visually stunning -- insanely so, the kind of movie where every inch of what you're seeing has something crazy going on. It's intense, to say the least. Yeah, the plot pretty bare bones, and there's almost no backstory presented and no explanation for a lot of aspects of this world, but that didn't bother me all that much. The leads are terrific, plain and simple. I guess one issue I had was that more than half of the movie is a single car chase -- which I liked; that's not the issue. The problem is the rest of the movie loses a little momentum after that. They add some tricks to the second car chase to make it different, but it's still just the same basic idea.

I was also a bit skeptical of all the viewers who claimed this was ""feminist Mad Max."" After having watched the film, I still don't quite see it. Yes, there's a tough female lead, but that's nothing new, nor is the fact that women are fighting (Asian martial arts movies have done this for decades). I'd feel a lot more convinced about the ""feminist"" angle -- and about the assertion that this movie is relevant to important issues in our world -- if they really had shown how those women were brutally treated. As is, they looked very pretty and not terribly damaged compared to the way real victims of that kind of horror would be. This is more a problem I have with viewers who try to read substance into popular films, not with the film itself. Fury Road is hugely entertaining, but I wouldn't go looking for deep insights into, well, anything, really.",1443398400,,1678,4.395498392282958

It was one long chase scene, and our hero Max... not a hero at all. He spent most of his time upside down, literally, in this. While I'm all for strong female leads, and Furiosa was great, the point of a Mad Max movie is... wait for it... Mad Max.
So many ways they could have went with this, but didn't. And I'm left irritated that I just watched what is essentially a long, drawn out, ill conceived, chase scene.",1443398400,2,578,4.169642857142857

7228156,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This isn't just a great action film, it's a great film period.

I actually felt tension and concern for the main characters, which is something missing from all of the silly action movies that have been popular lately, such as the Fast and Furious garbage, and the gazilion superhero movies.

Fury Road is brutal, but if you go back and watch, you'll see that it's never gory. It tells a great story with a spare, lean script. There's little text, but a lot of subtext, which is great.  All of the fluff was stripped away, which complemented the bleak subject matter perfectly. All of the action scenes are highly stylized, and variations on the car chase theme. They never feel repetitive, which is pretty amazing considering it's 75% action. The moments of quiet are paced perfectly to make the loud, frenetic sequences even more powerful.

I can see why excellent actors like Theron, Hardy, and Hoult were attracted to the concept of this film. Make no mistake, though--this movie revolves as much or more around Theron's ""Furiosa"" character than it does around Max, which is great.

One of the things I really love about the film is that it doesn't treat its audience like idiots. There's no drawn out exposition to reveal just how bad the bad guys are. You know they are warlords with total command over finite resources, which they parcel out to the masses at their whims. And that's all you need to know. A Max-free prequel could do some really great things to honor the solid frame work Fury Road presented the audience with.",1443312000,,1533,4.705223880597015
7228157,1,B00YQJRYGY,"In the other Mad Max movies, chase scenes were certainly a major element... but still made up a quarter or less of the movie. If you watch Fury Road, you'll see lots of inventive vehicles, plenty of car crashes, and no end to people dying in various fashions. That got old for me after the first twenty minutes. After that... I had to sit through the rest of the movie. I had told me wife at the start that it got great reviews.  I don't know what movie the reviewers were watching.",1443312000,,482,4.239130434782608

Maybe I didn't give this edition enough of a chance, as I stopped watching after about 30 minutes in, but there didn't seem to be anything new and/or significantly different. It was ultra-violent, with the depictions of violence reaping the benefit of modern film-making technologies. Overall, the main tone of the film was dark and gritty, and after 30 minutes I didn't come to like any of the characters, at least not enough to root for them.

Even the promo cover has Theron's Furiosa in the foreground and Hardy's Max in the background.  Still, it was a fun ride.  The action sequences were awesome.  After seeing Nicholas Hoult in Jack the Giant Slayer and Warm Bodies it was fun to see him be able to expand his acting chops playing a crazy role like Nux.

It definitely did not live up to all the hype.  But, there are worse ways yet to waste a couple hours.

The setting makes little sense. Is this futuristic? How can there be someone (max) from the real world, when he was a cop, when the other characters seem to indicate quite a lot of time has passed since the collapse? You've got mutants, grunts,and other assorted oddball characters.

I give up trying to make sense of it. As a fan of asylum movies, this can't even beat those out.

Mad Max is a fantastic character and how he wore that steel thingy on his face for so long is hard to comprehend.  It is a world I hope I never see or my children never see.

7228326,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Having received this DVD as a gift, I felt obligated to give it a chance, if only so that I could sound familiar with it when asked.  It was a mistake.  My wife and I watched the entire movie because we kept thinking there surely would eventually be a good part.  Nope.  This turkey was a mindless, chaotic, freakish, saturating, numbing assault on all the senses, with no story except some vague nod to the Mel Gibson films by virtue of its title.  Set in what is presumeably a post-apocalyptic desert,  a tribe of ragged derelicts franticly scurry about in commicaly cobbled hyper vehicles one might see in an ultimate demolition derby,  employing various outlandishly inventive ways of torturing and killing each other for no apparent reason other than entertainment.  I usually look for ""action"" movies, but when ""action"" is all you have to offer, it falls into the old category of No Redeeming Social Value.  Perhaps even Social Harm. If you want to be physically exhausted and emotionally bruised, and not sleep well tonight, then by all means watch this movie.  Otherwise, save a few bucks and your sanity, and keep a bit of spring in your step, avoid this rank bit.  Instead of a single star I would give it five SCARs.",1443139200,3,1227,4.686915887850467

7228355,1,B00YQJRYGY,"It is obvious the directors and writers were trying to set up the movie for the next couple of sequels because the movie ended in the middle of the plot.  Why don't producers make a movie like the ""Transformers,"" where there is a beginning and an end to the story until the next adventure happens.  Stop leaving the audience hanging in the middle of the plot. The chase scenes were good, but they went nowhere.  They went from point A to point B and back to point A.  Synopsis of the movie:  Think of a person living in hell...she then manages to escape killing many of her own people in the process.  Then for some unknown reason (probably due to bad writing) her character decides to take the advice of a stranger she met on the road, telling her to return to her previous hell. Movies are suppose to entertain, or uplift...this movie did not do either.  Expect lots of blood and gore.  The future is so dire no one should would want to be alive.  I hope the next time they escape a life of slavery....it is for good.  I would have rather seen them travel onto the salt flats in search of Utopia, rather than return to a life of living hell.  If they remain in that hell-hole in the next movie...I am through!",1443139200,3,1211,4.314159292035399

7228377,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Okay I know a lot of people who thought this movie was good. Yes it is and No it is not.
The Good: Special effects and action. Uhh: okay that about covers that.
Whoever wrote the dialogue for this movie and got paid for it: is laughing all the way to the bank.
I grew up with the original Mad Max and the others that followed. This movie appears to place Max between the first and second movies and tries to explain how he got the way he did. This of course is just my opinion. What it does is portray Max as a woose. There are things that make no sense however you try to explain them about this movie. Too many loose ends. It appears to have characters from all three previous movies mixed in but does nothing to explain why. Now please do not get me wrong: I like CT: I am a fan of the Aeon Flux movie, which hardly anyone else is. I like the Resident Evil movies: so I can enjoy a good B movie as well as anyone, but this I just did not enjoy.
Side note: did anyone else catch the fact that in the film the pair is being chased through a natural bridge that gets blown up. The later when it appears that they return through the same canyon the natural bridge is again made whole. IT WAS A MIRACLE OF NATURE.
I caught myself looking to stop the movie before the mid way point. Thank god for fast forward. Too much was thrown in for shock value with no real tie in to the story line. I recommend you watch it for the action, but not for watching a Mad Max movie.",1443139200,,1464,4.0

Unfortunately, Charlize T still has  that empty and cold look in her eyes, regardless of the movie, it seems. She doesn't seem to be engaged with anything or any body.

7228426,1,B00YQJRYGY,"My god this movie is dumb. I felt like I lost IQ points from watching it. Charlize Theron plays Imperator Furiosa a one armed mad women who is trying to smuggle wives of Immortan Joe. Mad Max (played by Tom Hardy who barely does anything more than grunt) gets captured by Immortan Joe and his band of thugs. Imperator Furiosa steals a fuel truck and the chase is on. For some reason I never did understand, Tom Hardy's Max is being used as a blood bank for the thugs. These thugs, for some reason, take Max on a car chase to catch Imperator Furiosa. Max escapes and joins up with Imperator Furiosa. But when they first meet up, they fight and Imperator Furiosa almost stabs Max. In the next scene, they are buddy buddy. One of the baddies who was hell bent on killing Imperator Furiosa for some reason all of a sudden joins up with her. No real reason why, he just does it. I forgot half the dumb things in this movie and don't care to ever watch this again. This movie is dumb dumb dumb!!!",1443139200,5,990,4.2712765957446805

7228493,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I've seen many reviews of this film, while mostly heaping praise as it deserves there have been some negatives. I'm just going to address the negatives for doubters, first this movie is damn near perfect. It's shots are one of a kind if you go behind the scenes to understand the technical difficulties of this movie. It's just as near perfect execution for a vision as one can get.

Now address those people that have cons
There are two leads, there is no feminist agenda and Tom Hardy is still the star.
Tom Hardy took his character directly from Mel Gibson and his version is spot on. He dspent say much, he never did.
The action makes up 90%of this movie, if your bored, that's a personal taste there isn't a wasted moment
The run time is perfect, you never even notice time passing
There are no weak performances
The story has more human emotion than some academy films, it manages to tell a small story on a large scale and make its characters believe able

To end this, I've watched this movie 5 times already and it is not work out. I still find little easter eggs and shots I didn't notice before. I have even more respect for the stunt teams that pulled this off and the highest respect for George Miller when you realize there is very little CGI, they used working models and practical effects. Those skills are what made movies magical not the computers behind giant robots with action that's impossible to follow.",1443139200,,1426,4.523255813953488

This has nothing to do with Mad Max in my humble opinion. Look at the artwork for this movie, it has a picture of a girl, and some random guy in the background. That random guy is what they are trying to pass off as Max. The story is more about the girl.

With that said, it is an OK movie with a typical Mad Max look to it. But they should have been honest and gone with a different name. Maybe something like: Mad Max and his magic bus.",1443139200,,603,3.824

7228625,5,B00YQJRYGY,"If you are a fan of the originals, you will love this. Fury Road takes what was great about the previous films and ramps it up tenfold. Each installment of the Mad Max series has been more absurd than the last, but Fury Road manages to do this without being silly in the way ""Beyond Thunderdome"" was. There is so much to love about this film, starting from the fact that it is basically a 2-hour chase sequence, to the juxtaposition of flame-throwing heavy metal guitars with classical music, the highly saturated gold and blue colors (when most post-apocalyptic films are mostly muted grays and browns), to the much praised performance of Charlize Theron and her clan of ass kicking old ladies. Tom Hardy is likable, but considering he's basically a human hood ornament for about the first half hour of the film it's not surprising most critics would rather see Theron star in the sequel.",1443052800,,889,4.705128205128205
7228626,1,B00YQJRYGY,"I don't even know how to start listing all the negative things about this movie. So I'll just say the only positive it has: the visuals are stunning. Other than that this movie is a waste of time and brain capacity. The movies is just on long extended violent shot, the storyline while being none existent is incredibly uninspired. Really I can't even talk about this movie, maybe that will make it go away from my memory. On top of that the streaming was awful so there was no redeeming factor here.",1443052800,2,500,4.445652173913044

It was all blow em up special effects, stupid dialog, and a number of the scenes were sped up and looked silly with people moving in fast motion. Whoever directed this should go to directors school.

7228634,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Okay, so I realize that quality is subjective and that this movie is clearly not for everyone but if you can just level with me for 5 minutes I need to make sure that one thing is entirely clear. The vast majority, if not all of the people who have given this movie less than a 4 are unable to appreciate the brilliance of this film. This movie does so much right that I don't even know where to begin. The fact that most of the stunts are done with practical effects, that Tom Hardy totally brings his own presence to the role despite having very few lines, the brilliant use of music, the composition, the color palette, the hot redhead girl, the outrageous vehicle designs, the unapologetic refusal to not go balls to the walls. This movie is art, pure and simple and if you truly love films as a visual storytelling medium as well as a form of entertainment and are at least 17. (Them's the rules, supposedly.) You owe it to yourself to see this wonderfully enjoyable film.",1443052800,,977,4.403314917127072

Especially if you have any memory of the movie on which this was based, ""Road Warrior."" That film actually had a story. Characters you cared about. Interesting characters. A beginning, middle and and end. This one, not so much. Presumably put together for those with attention deficit disorder, there is no attempt to develop the characters or explain the backstory. No time. Let's just do a two hour car chase through the desert! Like the ending sequence in the original movie.... except make it the entire move. Endless stunts, crashes. explosions! Never mind the story. Look at those cool vehicles. Marvel at the amazing stunts. And how about that crazy makeup? Dialogue? Backstory? Who needs that? And then there is the who matter of essentially relegating Max to sort of supporting character. This is really Mad Maxine! Charlize Theron is the hero and the star. And a bunch of other women. Hear me roar! Oh please. Political correctness has even taken over in the vast wastelands of Mad Max. Maybe that's the only way they could get her to do the movie.. and cut her hair. Meanwhile, Tom Hardy, aka Max, just stumbles around in the background most of the time. Says nearly nothing. And when he does, it is mostly in whispers. Mel Gibson, he ain't. Oh sure, the vehicles are really really cool. And the non stop stunts are incredible.  But that does not a movie make.  Go back and watch the original and then tell me it's not a much much better film. Much was made of hiring the director of the original film.

I like my movies to have a plot besides war mongers hell-bent on capturing escapees. Seriously, it's like WWF went from the ring to the desert road. The whole time i was left to wonder why the F do these idiots, who are clearly in charge of something (water?), hell bent on capturing the people who escape. Heck, there's no context as to why Theron's character is even driving a semi to begin with. Was she supposed to be delivering something? to who? why? who are these people? who is the stupid leader? Too many questions, zero context.

No one ever says why, they just go hard and fast and posse up for a road trip, complete with some idiot playing guitar in a one-man-band sorta rig, which honestly adds zero value to the story, it's just fluff. Did they (the producers) really sit down and decide, ""yea, let's put a guitarist on truck with a make-shift stage and amp rig and have him play the SAME song throughout the whole movie and chase"". There is nothing of value to that. If i were the leader, i'd be pissed we have that fool there, i'd rather have a machine gun or something that can actually help.

Anyhow, if you don't care about story/plot, only care about senseless action, and a royal rumble experience on wheels, this is for you. This movie is all hype and zero substance, hence the 2-star.",1442707200,,1421,4.482625482625482

Creator George Miller once again demonstrates his deft touch offering jaw dropping action set pieces and stunningly imaginative art and production design.  All would be for naught if the film didn't have finely honed characters and story and as demonstrated in the initial trilogy Miller delivers.  Not unlike Mel Gibson in ""The Road Warrior"" star Tom Hardy plays Max close to the vest ceding the spotlight to Furiosa played by Charlize Theron in a ferocious turn.  Furiosa is a strong willed woman living in an oppressive wasteland society waiting for her opportunity to cut loose and does she ever.  The grudging relationship developed between Max and Furiosa is compelling and believable giving the audience a viable rooting interest.

""Fury Road"" is the best action film I've seen in possibly a decade or more. Max's sparse dialog is a perfect case of less being more in a story. I've always liked the fact that Max is a mysterious character.

Furiosa is an amazing female character that will go down in cinematic history as one of the great action genre strong women.

As I waited for release day, I worried that I wound feel disappointed as I sometimes do after my husband raves about a movie.  Expectations set too high, I suppose.  Well, I found this to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Period.  Just amazing.

I'm not going to go into all the amazing things that struck me during the movie - I'd be here all day.  For all it takes place in an ugly, post-apocalyptic world, there was some real beauty to it - for example, the fluidity of the men swinging on the tall poles, which was simply poetry in motion. The action was fantastic, the effects were fantastic, the music was fantastic.  Even the insane guitarist that rode on one of the vehicles managed to be a thing of almost grotesque grace that just FIT.

The acting was top notch all around.  Having said that, Charlize Theron stole the show.  She really is just a tremendously gifted actor and her portrayal of Furiosa had such depth to it.

This movie should not be called Mad Max, it should be called Mad Maxine.  Charlize Theron is pretty good in her part and HER part is almost the entire movie.  Tom Hardy has so few speaking lines and is so not a part of the picture that I wondered why he was even IN it.  It's a poor substitute for the originals.  It doesn't even begin to compare with Mad Max Beyond Thunder-dome, for instance with Tina Turner.  This movie has no character development, you simply don't give a hoot what happens to them.

I don't feel like I need to bore anyone with an analysis of the story because there really isn't much of one.  This movie is all about the visuals, stunts & explosions.  Tom Hardy pulls off the title character fairly well, but the real star is Charlize Theron.  She knocks it out of the park.  The only real complaint I have is the method they employ of cutting a few frames out of scenes to ramp up the speed.  I've noticed other films doing it but this one does it a LOT & it's very noticeable.  Also, who is the little girl who keeps appearing in those flashbacks Max has?  It's never expanded upon.

Impeccably and painstakingly filmed and imagined, the world of Mad Max: Fury Road is rich, deep and recognizable, like a complicated dream you once had after a long, hard day. It's somewhere between Sergio Leonne, Samuel Beckett, Federico Fellini and Ursula LeGuin: there is a whole world-view and a program for thinking and living weaved into its perfectly choreographed actions sequences and plot twists. At once mythic, funny and harshly material, this will tickle your everything. Then you'll go back to your waking life and realize you're still there in that desert, that it was all real, but that Mad Max was just a more honest depiction.",1442448000,,707,4.949579831932773

7228814,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Some crazy action/stunts on this ride through the wastelands.  The colors, the landscapes, and the tone of the action scenes created an atmosphere that stuck with me for a while after the movie was over.

The themes are familiar, but done well -- who dominants for resources, manipulates others to maintain control, and who rebels against it all and why -- and it's this situation that Max finds himself uncontrollably (at first, at least) caught up in.

I also appreciated the details and effort put into the culture of this group that lives in the Citadel, their home in the barren expanse surrounding them -- their habits, phrases, concepts, values -- for me it helped reinforce the strange, distinct world everything takes place in.

I was disappointed when the ride was over, wishing I could stay longer, hoping for another Max story soon.",1442448000,3,844,4.881118881118881

7228839,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Although Max is the titled character, the real hero is Charlize Theron.  The women steal the show.  They are tough, smart, and don't back down from anything.  The movie empowers women to fight back against tyranny and evil.  It was interesting to watch a movie, which on its face is about the mythical Max, get taken over by women.  In the dust and despair of a future not explained, women are used as baby and milking machines.  People are increasingly marginalized by a poisoned world.  Lawlessness rules.  Cars are weapons used to impose the will of the powerful.  The images of a dying world are striking.  Against this backdrop comes a woman who refuses to submit to the overlord of this bleak place.  She escapes with a crew of pregnant women in search of a mythical place where she used to live.  The last possible Garden of Eden in the vast wasteland of the world.  At her side is the mythical Max.  He helps her and her crew out as they flee, and then return to the wretched place they used to call home.  Although Max is the title character, he is the Sundance Kid to Theron's Butch Cassidy.  Tom Hardy, always an imposing person in any movie he is in, shrinks next to Theron.  It is a movie of unrelenting speed and action.  But underneath, there is a human quality that shines through.  Definitely worth the watch.  The movie flies by, but when it is over, you remember the softer moments of humanity.  Watch it with your daughters who adore princesses.  It will give them a new perspective on the power of women.  For the kids - There is violence, but nothing over the top.  There are a few uncomfortable scenes (especially when they discard a newly born, dead baby), but on balance, probably nothing the teens can't handle.",1442448000,,1737,4.529032258064516

People say there is no story when there is! It's about Furiousa driving the wives away from the evil leader. How can people miss that?
The stunts are of course good to look at but the characters were all likeable. Unexpected deaths occurred as well.

7228845,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I have a good 3D DVD collection and a good 3D DVD player.  When I played this 3D version I noticed the voice and lips movements were way out of sync.  Tried it on two players with same results.  I returned it to Amazon for an exchange.  Received the replacement and played it and got the same voice to lip movement out of sync.  I have never had to make any audio adjustments thru my player until this movie.  I had to adjust the audio sync to 240ms to get the lips to voice movement correct.  I have always kept the audio sync at zero for all other movies played without a problem.  Will adjust back to zero when I want to watch any other of my DVDs.  Maybe all copies of this Mad Maax Fury Road 3D Blu-Ray DVD are manufactured the same way?  maybe not?, but I received two of them.  Just unusual.  Not expected.

I watched this movie in HD on 4k TV and visually stunning in the beginning after watching 20th car crash it got old and I new there was more to come.

With A+ acting from Tom Hardy, who has very little dialogue, he is basically the sidekick of Charlize Theron's amazingly brute but humble-hero Furiosa.  She graces the screen with such power and attitude with one mission, to go home away from oppression.

I totally loved this movie.  Like, re-watched many scenes after I was done watching the first time.

The visuals throughout the movie were stunning.  Pause the movie at almost any point and it could be a picture for a computer background.  The colors that popped out during day shots versus the eerie twilight scenes.  The plot made sense and was fun.  All of the characters just did a kick ass performance.  Just like the original movie, they clearly had a lot of fun making all of the crazy vehicles.  I particularly appreciated how all the crazy contraptions has an insane sort of creativity and logic to them.

Hello, Hollyweak: are you afraid you can't sell Theron in a post-apocolyptic adventure without Mad Max's name? Real movie people spent the whole movie asking what this has to do with Max, just as everyone should have spent all of the awful True Grit remake asking why is a bitchy little whiner with a male lawyer backing her up considered a ""strong"" woman? as ppoor as the acting was in the original MM, it was still way better than this soulless crap. It's still better than casting a black man as James West in that day and age and watching people get horribly maimed and killed is still funnier than Ben Stiller.

7228996,4,B00YQJRYGY,"(This review is for the 3D version that I watched on my new Sony 4K TV with passive 3d, with content from DirecTV.)

I have to admit, I'm getting a little tired of the modern-day push for the so-called ""Strong Female Lead"" (SFL) character.  I just find it to be a little too pandering, and what's actually happening:  MEN are now losing out on a lot of roles because of it.

And this movie is called ""Mad Max,"" isn't it?  And yet, in reality, it probably should be called ""Mad Furiosa,"" because Charlize Theron is really the main character, while Tom Hardy is only just extra baggage.  To be fair though, even though Mr. Hardy is a man of few words here, he is still really good.

But still, if there IS going to be that SFL character that I brought up in paragraph one, at least she is played by Ms. Theron.  She is one of the strongest actors (actresses?) of our day; if you disagree with me, just catch any of her films -- why not ""Monster""?  She's terrific there.  And I'll begrudgingly admit that she's terrific here as well.  But would you expect anything less from her?

It is nice that this film isn't just a reboot of the original, and it is nice that this film isn't just a remake of the original.  As a matter of fact, it is nice that this film isn't any of those other ""re""s that I hate.  This is perhaps a continuation of the story, albeit with different actors.  Hey, while I may be the only fan that Mel Gibson has left, he's naturally too old to play this part.  So they had to bring in some new blood.

And you surely will see plenty of blood here.  And I usually will get more than just bent out of shape if a movie is too violent, but violence IS necessary in this film to make it work.  If you've seen the earlier films, you know how it goes.  It does remind me of more recent Quentin Tarantino films, where he really learned HOW to use violence and WHEN to use it.  If done correctly, violence in film will not seem exploitative.

Well I could say, ""I'm tired of all these damned Strong Female Leads nowadays!  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!""  But when you have Charlize Theron, well, you don't really have a right to complain.",1442275200,,2172,4.216019417475728

The women seemed to know what was going on.  She seemed so masculine, in one scene, I thought Max and her would kiss, but it was way too awkward so they didn't

Literally everything that is alive and breathing in this movie is completely badass. Watching Mad Max Fury Road changed my life forever, literally. After I watched it, I went in the bathroom to release the case of beer I unknowingly consumed throughout the course of this masterpiece, only to not recognise my reflection in the mirror. I was 1 foot taller, 76 pounds heavier, absolutely ripped, and I somehow grew the most glorious and magnificent beard this world has ever seen. I went to gasp since I was caught off guard by what I saw, but all I could do was bellow a guttural roar that shattered the mirror and made it burst into flames while a brief guitar solo played from thin air. I quickly left the bathroom in a state of utter confusion in an attempt to discuss this with my girlfriend who had also watched the movie with me, however she was no longer in the living room. It was at this time, that I realized our three harmless dogs must have watched the it with us as well, because they had been transformed into massive, ravenous wolves. I quickly charged torwards the front door in an attempt to escape these beasts as they snarled and snapped at my leather boots that had also appeared at some point during the course of all of this. I barely escaped certain death as I slammed the door behind me, but not before one of them had managed to take a chunk of flesh from my shoulder, which I was able to quick patch up with my new found field training abilities. Still in my state of confusion, I peered into the darkness of my normally quiet neighborhood, attempting to gather my bearings and figure out where an insanely loud noise was coming from when BAM! My girlfriend comes flying through the midnight sky, over my house and lands in front of me on a battle worn Harley Davidson with exhaust pipes spewing flames from the back, chains hanging from the sides, and human skulls mounted on each handlebar. Before I could even question this, our newly transformed wolf beasts busted down the door and started charging at the same moment my neighbors house exploded as a convoy of war machine death vehicles smashed through it. I quickly jumped on the back of her Harley and we charged down the street, with the caravan following close behind. I reached down into the saddle bag to find a double barreled sawn off shotgun and a hand full of shells, so I loaded the shot gun, and jumped onto the roof of the war machine behind us, blasted the driver through the roof of the car, and swiftly got inside and took control of the vehicle. With his bloody carcass in the passenger seat, and one shell left in the gun, I smashed the side of the car into another vehicle which was racing along side of me, and shot his front tire out, resulting in him losing control of the vehicle. His car flipped two times into the bloodthirsty wasteland caravan and bursted into a flaming ball of destruction, buying us just enough time to get away and for me to share my review...",1442275200,,3105,4.477954144620811

For example, the feral kid with the steel boomerang and the geeky pilot of the ultralight helicopter.  Besides Tom Hardy as Mad Max, ""Fury Road"" had... ummm... Charlie Theron... and... ummm... that's it for memorable characters.  As for Tom Hardy as Mad Max, it's got to be hard for any actor to practice some character development when for the first half of the movie his features were obscured behind a mask which also made it impossible for him to talk.  The one area where ""Fury Road"" unquestionable improved on it's predecessors was special effects: bigger, brighter explosions; wilder looking vehicles; and long, long action sequences where each succeeding stunt outdid the previous one.",1442275200,5,933,5.228187919463087

7229054,1,B00YQJRYGY,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It started out incomprehensible, then became clear -- just a bunch of mindless action sequences with no plot and zero character development. The character the movie was named after was more of a sidekick to Furiosa.",1442275200,,255,4.818181818181818

7229057,3,B00YQJRYGY,It's mainly about stuff blowing up and racing and guzzline and water. There's almost a story happening here but it never happens. It's waterworld without water. And less character development.,1442275200,,192,5.433333333333334
7229058,4,B00YQJRYGY,"It's more than obvious, especially at the beginning of the movie. It almost makes the testorone-driven action scenes seem pretty juxtapositioned. Maybe it was supposed to be ironic? Besides the movie obnoxiously shoving an agenda up your nose, the movie has some great action. Scenes that definitely make you say ""Oh s***!"" out loud. Unfortunately, Max stays pretty quiet at the beginning, but the last half of the movie, he's definitely the star. I would definitely recommend a rental to anyone who likes action films.",1442275200,,519,5.117647058823529

If you don't know the type of universe this movie takes place in (post apocalyptic Earth that's twisted by radiation), just understand that there are things you just have to buy into.

7229188,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This is a two-hour chase movie, as most have agreed. The plot is minimal, but what you'll see is some imaginative vehicles and vehicle-based attacks, such as people hanging off tall poles to jump onto other vehicles and so on. This is an action movie, first and foremost.

It's also unexpectedly touching, in the person of a baddie who slowly transforms into a good guy. And, of course, the scene where he points to a tree but doesn't know what it is ... priceless.

The rest? Most critics hailed it as an amazing feminist statement. Perhaps they were looking for a ""respectable"" way to say they enjoyed its mostly mindless spectacle. Most of the women here are scantily clad and part of a harem. Only Theron is the now-all-too-stereotypical tough chick ... and that's the problem. Because her stereotype is in every movie or TV show we've seen for the past two decades, she doesn't really make much of a statement in this movie. We've seen her many times before, and we've come to expect it. It's sad, because the characters in every movie are now such a predictable ""diverse"" mix, and any one that deviates is in for some serious complaining from our appointed industry watchdogs. (For example, Jurassic World was called out for not having women who were sufficiently man-like. Or was it the reverse?)

I've read that all the stunts were supposedly au naturale, not CGI. I'm not so sure. Some of them seem pretty much guaranteed to have some CGI involved. Unless they had some incredible timing and camera placement. However, I think you could say that at least 85% of it is ""practical"", and that would be quite an accomplishment.

In short - enjoy it for what it is.",1442188800,,1669,4.666666666666667

7229219,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This latest installment in the Mad Max series is phenomenal.  It's a screaming metal rollercoaster that hooks you in the beginning and refuses to let you go until the very end.  With brilliant acting, strong characters, and even a wall of death mounted on a truck, it constantly bombards you with fantastic, beautifully shot scenes all the while telling a very well written story.

If you're looking for solid continuity between this film and the other three, don't bother.  There's not a defined timeline between the originals--other than the final days of civilization in the first one and post-nuclear holocaust in the other two--and this one follows suit.  It's best to view the series as different stories in the legend of Mad Max.  The latter three are all told by different narrators, which supports this idea and can explain the continuity problems between this movie and the other movies.  Another thing to keep in mind is that this film is a ""revisiting"" of the universe, not necessarily a sequel, nor a reboot, for that matter.

But one thing is certain, this is still Max Rockatansky, and he still kicks major tail.  Whether you're a newcomer to post-apocalyptic Australia, or a seasoned fan, you're going to love this movie.",1442102400,,1237,4.908653846153846

7229385,5,B00YQJRYGY,"It has been many years since I've felt compelled to buy a brand new release of a new movie, rather than just rent. After seeing this in the theater twice, I actually could not wait to watch this again. I don't see a need to review the art of a movie on a store site, because that is subjective (although a lot of the negative opinions seem to be from people use to the more formulaic modern style of summer blockbusters, like the superhero movies showing people have some kind of life-changing experience, start their journeys or careers and then fight villains, form a team, and have a shoehorned ""love"" story. Because of this commonality, these audiences have skewed ideas of what they call ""character development"" and ""plot."" Character development and plot can be structured in various ways, and this movie does have that along with a more direct storyline like movies specifically about battles. The positioning of this movie as a prominent summer blockbuster only brought it more exposure to people who normally wouldn't have cared about this, just like they didn't care about the early Mad Max films. This is proven by the contrasting other hit movies of the season like ""Pitch Perfect 2,"" and the Fast and Furious and Avengers sequels. Those are polished and chippy, and this is grungy, dirty, Australian cult cinema.) Anyway, when I shop for a disc, I want to know what is on it. The presentation is exceptional and much better than how it appeared when watching in 3D. The disc also includes a few deleted scenes and several behind-the-scenes bits about a half-hour each about various aspects of the film (characters, stunts,  vehicles and props, location, conception). There is no commentary track and after many years of listening to them and being more likely to choose a disc because of one, I don't really miss it. One of the neatest features is unpolished footage from the location shoot of the actual vehicles and stunts. Some have speculated there might be another release within the next year with alternative endings or a different version, but I am content with this one just as I was content with the movie I saw in the theater.",1442016000,,2149,4.776881720430108

7229423,4,B00YQJRYGY,"For some reason the aspect ratio seemed off on the HD streaming version of this film.  It looked like it was stretched vertically.  I have watched dozens of films via Amazon Instant Video and never had this problem before.

The film itself was a lot of fun.  Basically one big chase as a woman helps rescue some women from the citadel where they were nothing but baby factories.  They are off trying to find the ""green place"" with the bad guys right behind them.  The bad guys have drummers and a guitarist playing metal with a flame-thrower guitar.  That's what kind of film this is.  It screams ""F-Yeah!"" in almost every frame.

If you're looking for lots of plot and set-up, you're not going to enjoy this.  If you are squeamish, you definitely will not enjoy this.  If you like lots of hard-driving, beat-em-up action with some punk-rock and heavy metal thrown in and some like-able heroes, grab your popcorn and enjoy.",1441929600,2,923,4.635802469135802

When I first saw this movie in the theatre this past summer of 2015, my immediate reaction was I wanted to see it again and again and again. So as soon as it was available to rent on Amazon Prime, I didn't hesitate to rent it and watch it again and boy was it good the second time around. Brilliant filmmaking from the master G.

7229444,4,B00YQJRYGY,"As a Mad Max fan I enjoyed Fury Road overall.  Tom Hardy played the role of Max very well although I thought Charlize Theron's character carried the story.  It has the expected scenes of Max being chased through the desert by a horde of every type of vehicle imaginable driven by maniacal crazies. As in Mad Max 2 and 3 he encounters people from an isolated community living a few steps above the Stone Age dominated by a ""Badass"".
That  ""Badass"" in Fury Road, Immortal Joe, is the reason it is not my favorite of the Mad Max franchise.
Immortal Joe is a wimp compared to the scary cruelty of the Humungus  in Road Warrior and a heavy-handed clod compared to Auntie (Tina Turner), the smooth operator in Beyond Thunderdome .

It's filmed wonderfully, has pretty crisp editing & sound, and overall creates a simple but effective plot. I don't think the redemption arc was well-done, but the director did a fantastic job of melding the action with the character development otherwise. Despite its over-the-top elements it was visceral and affecting. Underplaying dramatic moments without a lot of exposition worked very well here. It watched it twice when I first rented it.

7229553,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a fascinating way to tell a story.  I found it unique.  Normally, with an action blockbuster I'm completely on the side of the good guys.  For Fury Road, I cheered the heroes (maybe anti-heroes), but for whatever reason (and as evil as he was), I could see the point of Immortan Joe's efforts regardless of the means he used to acheive his ends and grand vision.  Now that I'm thinking of it, just here, maybe he DID get what he wanted; a worthy successor, and a continuation of the human race without the disease.  Plus, he got to die in battle.  So, I can't really say that this movie was all about one side, or the other, but a tale about how different folks chose to survive in the harsh and unforgivable world they found themselves in.  Loved it (even the cheesy parts)!",1441843200,,797,4.344594594594595

7229561,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I see this movie from a different perspective than everyone else out there. Although I am young I found the predecessors to this film to be great and especially very interesting for around the time it came out. I came into this movie with a different mentality, a very open mind and already knowing that it wasn't going to exactly follow in the footsteps after the previous films. The previous films were made nearly 30 years ago I would think that people, well like to think, that it was a no brainer for it not exceed the expectations as upon seeing the previous films for the first time. It was your first experience of a movie so different at that time and thinking that with new technology it would surpass that experience. Similar to chasing your first hit of meth. It'll never happen. As far action movies go... This film did amazing. The ideas of being to create everything that happens in the movie (not wanting to spoil the film) is phenomenal. Along with the music carried out through the chase it really had me submerged into the film and leaning my head forward wanting to see what would occur next. I believe that this film was phenomenal, maybe because growing up I watched a lot of war movies with my father and loved explosions and the accurate music to comply with it. It gives off great emotions that are zipping around. Even then, I am not being bias to the film but looking at it with an open mind. Right away people bring up the previous films and begin to hate this movie. I don't believe that it isn't even fair to look at that way. It's a DIFFERENT film",1441843200,,1578,4.426116838487973

I get it--post-civilization isn't pretty. But come on. There was so much focus on the film contributing to some kind of steampunk visual cultural revival, but the other movies that did this (old Mad Max, 5th element, etc) were SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING to begin with--that is why people cared about the visual aesthetic of the films and that is why the visual things caught on.

Tom Hardy was almost secondary as Max, but he too did well with his role.  One point about renting the movie through Amazon -  be aware that you actually have a limited window of ""movie viewing.""  Once you start watching the movie you literally have only 24 hours access to the movie.

One car crash after another. Completely ridiculous stunts. And worst of all, Max is reduced to nothing more than a supporting character. Tom Hardy has the goods to play a wonderful replacement for Mel Gibson, but it seemed he was dealt a s***** hand in this debacle.
I honestly don't get why everyone thinks this is such a great film and I certainly don't understand why everyone thinks it's better than the original 3 films. But movies these days seem to stick to cater to the masses with insane gore and total mayhem, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I like a little bit of a story to go with it.

7229647,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Best Movie in the History of Mankind.  I have never witnessed anything more entertaining than this movie.  Every second of Mad Max is outstanding from start to finish.
On this blu-ray the special features are a must watch.  There were dozens of artists, engineers, mechanics & scrap junkies that searched for odd ball trinkets that are used all over the vehicles and set design.  The entire movie is built on a giant art canvas as the set design, it represents the History of Mankind up to a Nuclear Holocaust, what was left over that hadn't turned into ash had to be salvaged.
What you see is the Mad Max team's vision of what humanity would utilize, whether it be for weapons, vehicles, around their home, or what is considered clothing (including armor).  An example is the metal face Muzzle on Mad Max in the beginning of the film...this is literally crafted from a Pitchfork.  I loved this!

Also the Costume design is also outstanding and quite original, there is a homage to the Mel's Mad Max, but it's not a copy by any means.  Everything else is totally seperate from the original movies, except for the base plot of the Wasteland after a Nuclear Apocalypse

As far as the movie itself it is all you can expect and/or have heard...it's Action Packed Insanity from start to finish.  There's a ton of action, roaring vehicles, screaming villains, & amazing combat and fighting sequences with the vehicles involved.

The soundtrack is relatively simple but very good at getting your heart rate up at all the right times. I must say I really enjoyed it and with me it's probably just a score that will grow on me each time I watch Mad Max.

The actors are just awesome including Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron, I'd be inclined to say that Charlize actually stole the show in several parts of the movie, there is even a nod toward Mad Max being more about her character than Max himself, which is quite interesting.  Also not so far fetched.
The thing that impresses me the most is the lack of Dialogue in Mad Max.  There's a minimal amount of lines for even the lead roles.  To me this is where Hardy can excel.  He did ALL of his acting in Dark Knight Rises with Dialogue but you couldn't see his mouth uttering the words...so the acting and facial expressions came from his Eyes.  Now he's doing most of the acting with his 'Actions' and little to no dialogue.  Along with pretty much everyone else in this film.  They pulled it off quite well and anyone who tells you otherwise is not watching Mad Max with an open mind.  Some people unfortunately cannot process a movie like this.  Some can except it for what it is, then there's me who Effing Loves It.

This movie is cutting edge and has some serious swagger to it.  I really hope for at least 1 more movie, possibly 2 to follow this to make a nice little series out of it like the original.  I can tell how much hard work was put into bringing this film to life and I always appreciate when a collaberation of incredible efforts come forth to create an awesome movie.",1441756800,2,3026,4.489945155393053

7229660,5,B00YQJRYGY,"George Miller returns to give his franchise new life to a new generation of movie-goers and does so with great effect. Fury Road is an almost non-stop, action-packed 2 hour chase scene through a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

Charlize Theron takes on the role of Imperator Furiosa, one of the (if not the main) principle protagonist(s), and plays the role well, communicating story and character motivations while Tom Hardy picks up Mel Gibson's mantle as Max Rockastansky, a tortured, brutal loner. Hardy plays the role well, even though most of his dialogue is gruff, to-the-point commands or various grunts. To be honest, I would have enjoyed Theron giving up a little more screen time to Hardy, as Hardy's character is slightly more mysterious.

Though I've not seen the other Mad Max movies (I definitely want to after seeing this), my understanding is that Fury Road is somewhere in between a direct sequel and a reboot. George Miller has explained the series as more of a set of legends about the ""Road Warrior"" - the movies are pieces of frame-work narration by people through out the wasteland and, as such, certain aspects of the character are in flux. The world does feel as if it's been going for some time as there is particular jargon and various settings and customs the movie does not take the time to give back story on - they just are.",1441756800,,1351,4.793991416309013

For a movie that is essentially a single extended chase scene (with some of the most mind blowing action sequences ever put on film), Fury Road still does an incredible job of world building and character development, but all as part of the action.  It doesn't take a break in the momentum to tell the audience why we should hate the completely insane villains, or love our broken hero and kick-ass heroine.  Instead it shows us who they are in bits and pieces, right in the middle of their 100 mile-per-hour struggle against each other.

7229665,5,B00YQJRYGY,"PARENTAL CONTENT: We are always sensitive to movie / tv show content since our kids may want to watch with us or simply walk through the room. Overall, this is clean movie, even with a R rating.

- I can't remember any profanity.
- There is brief nursing mother scene within 10-minutes of movie that is kind of a shocker and an eye full.
- Later in the movie a naked lady in a cage. But special effects had her hair hanging and covering her 'parts' well or there was some CGI blurring or something. You see no true nudity in this scene.
- Almost all the deaths are bloodless (almost). The goriest part is when the bad guy gets his, but even that scene is very quick and a flash of gore/blood. His remains aren't shown but kept off screen.

+ Totally proved a very good movie can be created without all that content that parents may be concerned about their kids seeing.

STORY: First half is a chase. Second half is a race. It worked well and created non-stop suspense and action. There was very little lull in the action and suspense, but what 'quiet' scenes there are are necessary to the characters or story.

SETTING: The 'world' we are introduced to is rich with detail and mythology. It's very rich in visuals and crazy in concept, but it was perfect and explained a lot of why people do what they do.

CHARACTERS: Wonderful cast of weird.
Love how the gorgeous Charlene plays a one-armed warrior type (very believable). Mad Max as a man of few words in the beginning was a good replacement with Tom Hardy and I did not feel like I missed Mel Gibson (though he is the original Max).

At some level the character of Mad Max is a supporting character and felt like it was more about Furiosa. The tag-team effort worked well and made for a good story.

SPECIALS on Blu-Ray: There are about four specials. . .
+the Making of the movie
+the cars built for the movie
+ highlight on the characters of Max and Furiosa.
+ The deleted scenes were only two or three scenes; no big deal.

Otherwise the specials were cool and interesting. Not nearly as extensive as the extras on the Batman movies or Lord of the Rings movies, but that is okay. Our group still enjoyed the specials nonetheless.

OVERALL: We really liked this movie and don't regret buying the Blu Ray. For anyone watching it for the first time, you need at least two viewings because there is so much detail to the world, the characters and action.",1441756800,4,2409,4.407657657657658

7229678,5,B00YQJRYGY,"More than 30 years ago, the character of Max was formally introduced to American audiences through The Road Warrior, a movie that reinvented ""the chase scene"" in a way that we haven't seen since The French Connection.  Miller & Co. employed a myriad of rather revolutionary practical effects to make one of the best pure action movies ever made.  Fury Road seems to pick up where The Road Warrior left off, opening the movie with a foot chase, and then vaulting you into a sequences of car chases that makes the freeway scene from the Matrix franchise look pedestrian.  There is very little CGI for a modern action film, and most of it is used for setting (there's a chase through a post-apocalyptic sand and lightning storm, for example).  The jumps, explosions, and stunts are real, and the fact that there's such a focus on using actual vehicles and actually jumping, crashing, and exploding them allows for beautiful wide shots.  The audience is never left wondering what's going on or feeling slightly nauseated by ""shaky cam"" hiding either bad fight choreography or bad effects.  I thoroughly enjoyed the action in this film.

While you wouldn't necessarily watch a movie like this for its plot, what's there isn't bad. Charlize Theron as Furiosa is excellent and really steals the movie.  It's fitting that she's front and center on the packaging.  The bad guys in this movie are just as over-the-top as the original films in the franchise, but without the weird themes of sexual deviance that permeated the first two films.

All-in-all, if you liked the original trilogy, you'll love this movie.  If you're looking for a stereotypical 80s style action movie with its cheesy gun play and silly one-liners, that's not what you're going to get here.

I started to watch it a 2nd time in less than 24 hrs, but got bored in the middle mostly due to pretty weak acting from the main characters - hence 4 stars.

To all the people who I've heard complain about CGI, do your homework. Go find the video of raw footage that's out there. The main bits that are CG are Charlize's arm and some of the scenery. And those bits were used fantastically to add to the film and never stuck out as cartoony. All and all this is a beautiful movie to look at with amazing action sequences with a simple plot. Sometimes simple works for when they throw you into the world, this certainly makes you feel like you're in it.

7229966,5,B00YQJRYGY,"(This is for the movie, not the DVD specifically.)
I knew I'd like the film, given the rave reviews I'd read by people with similar taste. Still, nothing prepared me for how epic and fist-pumpingly righteous Fury Road is. Compared to the old Mad Max films, FR continues the tradition of having a minimal plot featuring the mandatory car chases. This film has a more distinctly framed plot with a coherent conclusion, unlike the previous films (I don't understand how some of the reviewers here dispute this. The first Mad Max just bumbles towards an incoherent fade out!). In the tradition of earlier Mad Max films, there are no female tropes, which is WONDERFUL and truly sets it apart from every other action franchise. Theron's character is not only presented as a strong leader and admirable person while deigning to focus on her womanhood, but also while making no fuss about her disability. She treats her stump in a realistic way, and it was just one of the many details that was well thought out and integrated into this epic portrayal of a society driven to its destruction by a megalomaniac wielding control with reins of toxic masculinity. The focus on water as the limiting resource instead of oil was refreshing and added to the feeling I had that this is Tank Girl in a parallel reality. This movie is truly special and will be enjoyed by fans of dystopian Sci fi, action, rock-and-roll, horror, feminism, special effects, etc. Really, I'm never this excited by movies!",1441670400,,1483,4.796875

7229982,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Liked the original Mad Max movies; not so much this one.  Tom Hardy seems poorly suited for the role. The plot can be completely summarized as a bunch of outrageously implausible vehicles chasing each other around in the desert. Gasoline, which is supposedly more precious than gold,  seems to be in abundance and everyone has a vehicle.

Ok, with that out of the way, it was a decent movie, epic in some parts, inane in others.  Most of it was boring until the final battle and the mutant bad guy was a silly character with a fake looking lung handing from the back of his neck...sort of a predator lite in the face.  If I watched it again, I suppose it would grow on me.  The finale battle was very well done with some real ingenuity, but there's a lot of waiting time.

Two things were incredibly agitating.  The sped up film, and the group of malnutritioned old lady mercenaries.  I mean, come on!  I got used to the sped up film until the final battle, then it reasserted itself to the forefront of my attention.

I want to give this movie 1 star really bad, for the bait and switch, calling it Mad Max.  He's not even the lead character, nor is he the hero.",1441670400,2,1039,4.165829145728643

7230035,4,B00YQJRYGY,"I'd give a 5 star review for the film alone, but I wanted to ding the DVD because it has an issue with the sound. I saw the movie three times in the theater with all the bells and whistles that offers, but I think they might have normalized the sound for the DVD release, with the result that noisy action scenes are way too quiet, and dialogue heavy scenes with little background noise are jarringly loud (especially after you had to crank the volume to make out the dialogue in earlier sections.) I'd also been worried that the film might not hold up on TV, but I was happy to see that most of the bits that suffer are really right at the start of the film, plus some of the desert sequences later (like when everyone sits around stargazing --  that played a little better on a big screen.) While it's not quite as magnificent on a TV, the movie holds up as a movie instead of just an effects extravaganza.
As for the movie itself, I have seen better movies, though this is probably the best action movie I've seen. A lot of people complain that it doesn't have any story or plot, but actually the story is fairly complicated from a screenplay's standpoint (it has three main characters each with his or her own storyline) and it meets all the marks that you'd learn in screenwriting class. I've noticed a trend in recent years that people equate ""story"" with ""thorough examination of each character's personality, interests and backstory"" or other words, confuse -story- with -characters- and if that's your way of thinking then you might indeed be disappointed with this movie. If you really care about such things, there are apparently companion comic books that can be had which get into the backstories and motivations of all the characters -- but the film is refreshingly concerned with ACTUAL plot (which is NOT the same as characterization) and lets you imagine or guess at a lot of things that are not vital to the story. Like, what is Furiosa seeking redemption for? It doesn't really matter and you can pretty well surmise that an evil dictator's trusted War Rig driver has done some bad things in her life -- the motive of redemption is there to serve the plot, not vice versa. I also like that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, it's often being wild just for the sake of spectacle. I mean, if you expect this is supposed to be a straight-faced, dour glimpse into warfare or the perils women or something like that, then you'll probably be unhappy because this is actually a story where a one armed lady, a guy painted like a skeleton, and an ex cop who eats a lizard in the very first scene, try to rescue a bunch of sex-slaves from villains named Immortan Joe, Rictus Erectus, The People Eater, Corpus Colossus and Bullet Farmer via many, many car chases. The film's structure seems to be to have about 5 to 10 minutes of plot, which usually leads to a car chase, then a break for 5 to 10 minutes of plot, that leads to a car chase, and so on. Really, the movie is about the car chases. Come for the car chases -- everything else is just gravy.",1441670400,,3071,4.4644128113879

That being said I went in with an open mind. There is a some good in this movie but there is so much bad that it is greatly disappointing. Ridiculous moments include: water is in short supply and precious yet when it is doled out by the local kingpin it is wasted with most pouring onto the ground; a rock guitarist in red long johns in the desert on the speaker filled truck; a nipple chained corpulent character; spray painting mouths to be ""chrome bumper like"" as an exit statement before dying; lighting a road flare inside a gas filled car with no explosion (gas ain't water, folks) and on and on. My friends and I spent more time laughing then enjoying. Just like John Carter they did not think this through. Some tighter editing and elimination of silliness would have made a better movie.

7230093,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Previously that title was held by Edge of Tomorrow. Common theme between the two is taking action scenes to the next level and putting a woman in there previously known for her physical attractiveness, but not necessarily her physicality. It isn't all about explosions and gunfire and especially not blood. It's about creating excitement and stunts in new, unpredictable ways. Then, take someone like Theron and give her a major part in that. Like Blunt, something appealing about the juxtaposing of beauty with kickass grit.

Heard some buzz about this movie, but one to never read reviews or watch trailers, it was all worth the diligent abstinence. I almost didn't know Theron was in it, and that would have been a nice surprise given her role. The DP pulled something off masterfully. Can't put my finger on it, but there was something so visually appealing to watch all this destruction and conflict executed the way it was. I'm sure the choreography and screenplay had something to do with that. I feel like the movie should win awards in those areas, not that I'm a movie expert of any kind - a snob, if anything.

Will likely watch this, again, and may buy it to add to the steelbook collection.",1441584000,,1203,4.751196172248804

I cannot say the Director did well with a plot, character development, or the acting talent given him.  Tom Hardy and his talent was completely wasted in this movie as he communicated in grunts and four word sentences throughout the movie.  I was not expecting much from Charlize Theron besides her playing the same character she seems to play in every movie, and I was not disappointed.

We did think the scenery of the movie was very good.  There were some interesting parts of the non-stop action that were interesting.  But, overall, we found it all the vehicles and different gangs involved hard to keep straight and impossible about which to care.",1441584000,,819,4.530612244897959

7230147,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie proves that George Miller hasn't lost his mojo, and that an intelligent movie can also be a blockbuster. As always Charlize Theron is excellent. Tom Hardy is a good and likable actor but he doesn't make us forget Mel Gibson. He is not as mad  and full of fury as Gibson was in the old Mad Max movies. Hardy's voice doesn't help him too much for this role either. The cinematography and the action scenes are superbly made. The girls rescued by Charlize Theron are very decorative. It is amazing to see how everybody wastes water and gasoline in a post-apocalyptic world supposedly lacking in both items. Villains and very weird custom vehicles are satisfactorily crazy. In the middle of all the mayhem, Miller slows the pace to show a few little jewels: Theron, after Hardy having lost two, out of three remaining shots, takes the rifle, uses Hardy's shoulder to hold the weapon and shoots the target perfectly, Hardy cleaning blood from his hands and face with mothers' milk, and the heavy metal guitar player on a vehicle with a wall full of speakers, playing his guitar, which is also a flamethrower, in the middle of ferocious battles.",1441584000,,1150,4.721393034825871

Oh, there's plenty of craziness but not a drop of effort went into building the characters to make them interesting.  The bad guy is a mean clown, his army are white painted ballerinas.

The movie is really Charlize' flick; she does her tantrum scream (mandatory in all her movies, like a Tom Cruise running scene).  Cool stunts, but you don't care.

7230223,3,B00YQJRYGY,I am not sure what all the hype was over Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller took about six pages of script and turned it into a two hour movie. My biggest complaint is that there was no back story developed  to any degree that made me sympathize with or identify with any of the characters. In all it seemed like a two hour exercise in bodycount and car crashes.,1441584000,3,361,4.1571428571428575

7230231,3,B00YQJRYGY,Not quite the same level as the original Mad Max.  This new Max was mostly a mute for most of the movie and we didn't find out much about him.

I would have given this movie zero stars, but didn't have that option. But I'm fortunate that the word ""awful"" has an adverbial that mean ""extremely"", and, accordingly, I modify my rating to: ""Awfully awful"".

I always find it a struggle to suspend my disbelief for these Death Race 2000 meets post-apocalyptic meat grinders because unless you own an oil field, auto parts store and are running a refinery, you're not out raiding in broad daylight with dozens of gas/oil-guzzling souped up psuedo-cars running V-8 engines. More likely than not, you are on foot and traveling as light as possible at night. And if you are lucky enough to have any fuel, hopefully, you are saving it for your generator.

That said, I do enjoy a good car chase/survival story that doesn't hold your hand and thinks it has to explain every little detail. I like filling in my own gaps thank you very much. This flick didn't do a whole lot of explaining and that's fine by me. Times are very hard, people are struggling and all they have left is hope. I really didn't have to know why Theron's character was doing what she did or how the gang chasing Max knew he was a ""Uni"" (loved the ""Blood Bag"" reference). I did appreciate the great stunt work and special fx that had me stopping and rewinding on occasion. In the end, I felt entertained for 2 hours and that's really what it's all about. Now, where did I put those car keys?

There have been several movies come out lately that were so hyped, so anticipated, that some peeps  were disappointed because the movies didn't live up to impossible expectations; think Jupiter Ascending. Personally I LOVED it! Mad Max? Another great movie thrown to the shark infested waters of the Critic Pool and torn to shreds. In this case, peeps were either expecting a new and improved version of the same old story that made the titles famous the first time, or, there is so much hype over the movie that it falls short (as I said before) of unattainable expectations. Tell me, what do ya gotta do to get five stars now days!? Is it ""uncool"" to admit that you loved the movie!? Are people afraid that all the other mediocre reviews are going to make them look bad if they vote how they REALLY feel!? WTF!?  Well, think on this for a moment...would you really have been satisfied if this movie was a rote copy of the first Mad Max, the only difference being newer faces? I don't think so. Remember what made the first Mad Max famous? It was the shocking WEIRDNESS of the storie as it screamed down the apocalyptic highway. Remember how freaky the scavenger bikers were in the POST apocalyptic sequel Road Warrior? How surreal Thunderdome was? That shocking bizarre-ness? The very first Mad Max was made on a pitiful budget, and was not expected to really, seriously, turn out to be anything like the unbelievable cult classic that it did, indeed, turn out to be. That obscure Australian B film, that brilliant fluke,  launched the ultra popular series that we know and have watched again and again today. Those old films are twenty-thirty years old!! Well I think this new version of Mad Max was so different, so unexpected, that it will take a while for the ""new weirdness"" to sink in. I didn't know what to expect when I started the video. I'd heard some say that it was terrible. I'd heard some say that it was indescribable! The trivia said that MOST of the stunts were done with real stunt people and that CGI had very little to do with this non-stop rolling powerhouse. But as I watched this mind blowing movie I begin to see all kinds of NEW bizarre-Ness that left me jaw dropped! Example: that freaky dude playing a three hundred pound, flame throwing guitar, whilst screaming across the desert on a HUGE vehicle made of rolling amplifiers!?!? Read the trivia. That is some freaky stuff! I don't want to put in a bunch of spoilers, so let's just say that the whole movie never drops below ""pedal to the metal"".  Charlie Thereon throws her legendary beauty out the window and does a FANTASTIC job as Ferocia. And Tom hardy (Lawless) with his slow deliberate voice and subtle gritty-ness made a great Max. He is the complete opposite of Mel Gibson's handsome, and clever Aussie portrayal of the hero Max. And the villain in this remake was just as shocking as the masked maniac in the first Road Worrior! According to the trivia, there are two more instalments? Not sure. But the point is, THIS version of Mad Max was so shocking and different that, I think, it's going to take a while to start to build a new group of fans and followers. But what I do know? I will be one of them.",1441584000,,3212,4.551903114186851

The story was great, it did not seem to deviate from the Mad Max stories of 30 years ago.  There were some film tricks used in the old movies that were also used in this movie, which made it seem like the gap had not been ~25 years since the last movie.

7230328,3,B00YQJRYGY,"As a long-time fan of the Mad Max movies and lore, this one disappointed.  Very little character development, very little human drama.  It's all action.  The theme is survive, and that's it.  The plot is fight to get away, and then fight to get back, and that's it.  The truly sad part: Max didn't even need to be in this movie.  Max is a two-dimensional side-character.  Charlize Theron's character is the main character.  It's not Max's story, it's her story.  Max just kinda helps out.  Tom Hardy (Max) maybe said thirty words in the entire film (a shameful waste of an incredible actor).  It's a two-hour rollercoaster ride broken into two-minute action sequences.  Looks good, sounds good, well acted (what little acting was required), but anyone looking for the cerebrally-appealing Mad Max tradition, wait for this one to be free-of-charge.",1441584000,,847,4.9714285714285715

So I won't bother reviewing this truly excellent film & instead say a few words about the paltry excuse for a blu-ray/dvd release. Special features are sadly lacking & extended & altered versions are being held back for separate release dates.  Now is it just me?...or has home version been slightly edited?! I saw this movie four(4) times in the theater (twice in 3D) & I have a pretty good memory, especially when it comes to film or television content. So you can imagine how disturbed I was- by at least two scenes having been slightly altered!? It is literally a matter of seconds, but it throws things off (for me at least) when seeing the ""finished"" product. The most notable scene was when Furiosa finds out what has become of the green place & her people. The moment seems to have been re-edited & cut short? As I said- I could be wrong, but as this was literally the most emotional scene in the whole film; not to mention my favourite. I noticed the difference immediately. If this isn't a problem for you or you're never seen the film, then I suppose it's worth it to buy, because it is still a great movie.

We can't understand 80% of what the characters are saying and the plot, or LACK thereof, makes absolutely no sense.  Overall, just a very bizarre piece of cinematography. Some day, I'll take the time and make the effort to ask a rational, intelligent fan (preferably at the very least, someone who managed to graduate from high school) of this series what it is about this thing that holds their interest, that fascinates them about this silly creation.

There is a plot, but it is fairly predictable.  I did like the opening narrative from Max, describing what had happened to the world.  It sounded just like my son's voice, making up a story on the spot to amuse people.  Oh, and I appreciated the stunt people, they did some crazy stuff.

but quite a bit of dialogue demanded a volume nearer 80.. and even then I would rewind to hear it for sure.
I realize they made this for movie theater sound systems, and yes, I was using my tv speakers.
Still... do they suppose everyone has theater or 7.1 surround?

the movie itself was really pretty good.. very much in the 'key' of the original.. reflected in the writing and ideas thereof.
By pretty good I mean nothing terribly corny, or sllly, etc.. and I expected those things so.. even borderline lack of depth stuff was
still acceptable.

The rest was a riot. Really fun to watch. Kept my attention all the way through. Well acted.. fantastic stunts.. loved the cars.. loved the characters

He creates circus like atmospheres in films that are breathtaking and beautiful and over-the-top.  His story lines are often depicting the struggle between man and himself.  All of it under the backdrop of intense battle, which I find very compelling.  It was just a really well-made film. Now in terms of the script, there wasn't much of one, but I think that she is Frank Miller style. I don't think he's really looking for a strong reality to be present. It's more about the art.

Although Hardy looks the part, the script presents a Max so laconic that he barely exists. In fact, for about the first half of the movie, Max is literally nothing more than a hood ornament, allowing Charlize Theron to take command of the movie as the slightly less laconic Furiosa.

7230427,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The Mad Max series is finally enjoying a long awaited (30 years!) return to form (or is it?). Fury Road brings our titular hero back into the spotlight where he deserves to be. This time around Mel Gibson has been replaced with fan favorite actor Tom Hardy (Inception, Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises). Not only was Hardy a perfect cast from the aesthetic standpoint (looks very much like a younger Mel Gibson in the movie) but the way he plays the character makes it feel like he's been doing it forever.

The supporting cast was anything but lost in this one. In fact many people will say they stole the show (mostly because of Hardy's more limited role). Theron turns in an excellent performance as the Imperator Furiosa and raises the bar of the female hero almost to the levels of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley from the Alien movies. Nicholas Hoult (Google him) plays someone that hardly resembles him or anything else he's done and does a great job making you feel conflicted about his char...

7230476,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max-Fury Road(released May/15)the single disc edition,stars,among others,Tom Hardy,Charlize Theron,Nicholas Hoult,Hugh Keays-Byrne and Rosie Huntington. I must admit I was a little skeptical before watching this,as it had been about 20 years since the last Mad Max film. Well,I am happy to report that the film overall was an adrenaline pumping delight as director Miller had not lost his touch.
The story finds  a huge populace surrounding and living in the Citadel,in the same post apocalyptic world of the previous films. The head of the colony is Immortal Joe(Keays-Byrne) who lives high above the poor populace below,dispensing water to them from huge underground streams,when warranted. Joe has a large coterie of females,a harem if you will, and a huge army of fanatical followers who worship him. Theron is one of his lieutenants(Furiosa)  and she is sent on a mission to retrieve gas from Gastown and return. For this she heads up a posse of guards and she herself drives the big rig tanker.
Meanwhile Max has gotten himself captured by Joe's crew,is tortured and is now being used as a blood bank for one of the warriors. When Theron suddenly turns off the main road to run east, it is much a surprise to Joe as it is to Theron's thugs who follow her. Joe has a hunch and checks his harem to find the chamber empty and puts two and two together. Sure enough Theron has stolen his girls and is headed back to the Green Place,from where she was snatched as a youngster,in search of a new life for herself and the others. Joe himself leads the rest of his men in a huge chase after Theron.
When the warrior whom Max is giving blood to volunteers,Max is tied to the front of the vehicle that warrior drives and has ringside seating for the inevitable chase and conflict that will come. Eventually the group catches up to the runaways. A huge skirmish ensues and everyone drives into a huge massive super sandstorm which wreaks havoc on both sides. The vehicle's driver which Max is shackled to spots the rig in the storm and drives after it. Unable to disable the rig he ends up crashing his ride. When the storm clears Max is on the ground but still shackled to the unconscious warrior. He cannot take his restraints off so he ends up carrying the warrior,eventually arriving at the rig. Beside it stands Theron and the women she is carrying. In the distance Joe and his gang are seen on the horizon,so time is running short. Max takes the rig for himself but doesn't get far as Theron has it rigged for just such emergencies. Max at first refuses to let Theron and her women on board but acquiesces when Theron agrees to get the mask/restraint he has been wearing since his capture,off.
Theron heads into a canyon to a pre-arranged rendezvous with another gang. Her original intention was be there alone(the others are hiding),leave them the fuel tanker and in exchange for passage have them blow up a rock formation to block the canyon from any pursuers. Time is too tight and when the leader of the gang gets mad at the sheer numbers of her pursuers, she yells for them to run for it. Just as the rig goes through the canyon the walls reign down and block Joe's passage. However Joe himself commandeers what is essentially a monster truck and traverses the blockage in pursuit of Theron. In due time Joe catches up with the rig and another skirmish starts. In the ensuing melee,one of the woman who happens to be pregnant with Joe's child, is killed when she is pulled over board and Joe himself crashes his ride while trying to avoid her.
Theron,Max and the group reach an old hydro tower with a naked woman atop it. Max smells a trap,but Theron recognizes it from past memories. She walks towards the tower and yells out who she and her mother were. From the sand dunes on either side comes several woman on motorcycles and other vehicles. They surround Theron and greet her with affection. Theron has reached friends from The Green Place, but it no longer exists she is told. Theron is devastated. She devises a plan for all of them to go about 160 miles straight west where she believes there will be salvation. Max lets them leave on their own,but changes his mind and catches up with them. He tells them there is nothing out there but salt flats. Their best bet would be to turn around and go back to the Citadel where there is plenty of water and other resources. They just have to get by Joe and his gang.
With the plan securely in place the group heads back and part way along they pass Joe who realizes they are headed back home,and there is no one guarding it. He races off eventually catching up and trying to wreak his usual havoc. In the fight Theron herself is severely injured and in need of a blood transfusion from Max. However,and more importantly,Immortal Joe is killed outright. They strap his body to one of the vehicles when the fighting is done and head back to the Citadel. Upon arrival they are of course challenged. When they show them Joe's dead corpse the area,seething with poor on lookers,erupts in cheers. Theron and the woman are raised up to the Citadel on a huge platform while Max walks away below,giving Theron a furtive glance over his shoulder.
It is obvious from the very first chase that director George Miller has not lost his touch with the traveling shot nor with his stunt teams and resultant vehicle crashes. They are even more intense,if that's possible,from the last Max films. I do not know any of the production work that was carried out but I can safely assume there were either some nears misses and/or injuries during those chase scenes. Director Miller has now a more advanced slate,technologically speaking, from which to work,and he pulled out the stops with this one.
It is quite the world we are immersed into. Scenes like the lactating women who are hooked up to machines to retrieve breast milk. While we only briefly see them,there are also people who walk through swamps on stilts,looking like human spiders.
Any weakness comes,I found,in the lead actor Tom Hardy. I thought he was a little too wooden. I immediately thought someone along the lines of Gerard Butler could have handled that with much more panache and range. And hey,where was Mel Gibson? Despite his career troubles of late,I thought he still should have at least had some part in this film.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a well done sequel to the series. Lead Brady as Max was a bit too weak for my tastes, but those famous over the top pursuit,maniacal fighting and crash scenes are there and bigger and better than ever. Four solid stars. Recommended.",1441497600,,6692,4.636899747262005

7230485,2,B00YQJRYGY,"In an attempt to deliver on his promise of non-stop action Miller forgoes a traditional three act structure and all character development as a result.  The farce is that no film can actually be two hours of constant action as the audience would become desensitized halfway through.  No, there is plenty of down time despite what the filmmakers have said to the contrary during their PR junkets.  And during the calm moments there is no character development.  I understand that in a Mad Max film the vehicular homicidal horde is there to drive hard then die in fiery wrecks.  We don't really need to get to know these guys.  Unfortunately, the only things that separates the main villain and his two counterparts from the horde are their more ornate outfits and slicker rides.  Tom Hardy's performance as Max was hard to watch.  From his broken glass on razor blades voice to his sometimes crazy and uncaring, sometimes lucid and empathetic persona, I felt I was watching a film student's botched attempt at a bad stock protagonist.  Charlize Theron plays a one-armed chick who is covered in dirt and grease all the time and has a buzz cut.  The only other thing I know about her character is that she was abducted as a child and now seeks redemption.  I have no idea why an abductee would need to seek redemption and no one in the film ever explained it to me.  On the plus side, most of the auto carnage ranged from campy to intense and was very enjoyable to watch.  And hence my two very generous stars.  A film with action but no character development is not a film at all.  If you want to see the cool car action, and it was cool, then pick up a used copy and in 2D.  I found the 3D a little distracting once things got chaotic.",1441497600,,1733,4.453968253968254

This reboot of the 1979 Mad Max franchise takes action to a whole new level. The crazy thing is that most of the stunts are not CGI. The film is about a post apocalyptic future where humanity has taken steps back to a tribal existence. In this desert world water is scarce and ruled by a cult leader named Immortan Joe. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) hijacks an armoured tanker truck and escapes with his wifes. Max (Tom Hardy), who has been taken prisoner, is taken on the pursuit ride. Eventually Max and Furiosa join forces and try to turn the tables on their pursuers. This film is like one long action scene full of crazy stunts, and spine tingling action.

The 3D version looks great and enhances the action. The 3D is as good as I've seen in any movie including ""Dredd"", ""Avatar"", or ""Alice in Wonderland"". There are many special features including the making of the film, deleted scenes, stunts, and interviews with the director and actors.",1441497600,,1055,4.733695652173913
7230488,4,B00YQJRYGY,I had heard great things about this movie when it first came out. I was told it was a very fun movie with non stop action. After finally seeing the film I have to absolutely agree. The action scenes are entertaining and full of fights and explosions. Some people have claimed the plot is bad but I didn't see anything wrong with the premise of the movie. The film is meant to be an action movie and in my opinion it delivered on that quite nicely! I'm a fan of Tom Hardy but Charlize Theron is the true main character in this film. Her character is more interesting but that is not the fault of Hardy's portrayal of Max by any means. Her character is just naturally more appealing because of the storyline. Overall a very fun movie that I very much enjoyed!,1441497600,3,757,4.300699300699301
7230489,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Why did they put ""Mad Max"" in the title?  They should have called it ""Charlize Theron and a Big Dope that Doesn't Speak"".  I was so hopeful because the first two films were AWESOME (and I could even tolerate parts of Thunderdome).  This is the Jar Jar Binks of the series, no doubt.",1441497600,29,282,4.283018867924528

7230492,2,B00YQJRYGY,"While the film is called Mad Max, it actually feels more like Furiosa Fury Road as it concentrates more on Theron's Furiosa character and her story where Mad Max is just a passer by.
Being tracked by multiple outlander gangs, the story is scattered and becomes confusing at times when you wonder who is chasing who. Also, I know it is Hollywood but some of those vehicles wouldn't catch up with Max/Furiosa with the head start they get throughout the film such as the Monster Truck (you'll know it when you see it). At least match vehicles speed with the capabilities of the vehicles so it can be believable.

The vehicle sequences are good and well made but feel more like a nod to the original films rather than a key part of this film. In summary, doesn't feel like a Mad Max film as he takes very little screen time when all is said and done.

Obviously Mel Gibson is Mad Max but I didn't deduct stars for that although I still think Gibson should have reprised his role.",1441497600,,975,4.411111111111111
7230493,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Really cool.  It looks and feels so much like The Road Warrior and it expands that creepy, post-apocalyptic world.  George Miller created a masterpiece, I think.  I'd like to see him team up with Thomas Hardy again.  Theron was really good and so was Nicholas Hoult.  All of the War Boys/Half-Life boys were cool - I think they were inspired by the Gyro Captain in Road Warrior, who (as I just learned from IMDB) was played terrifically by Bruce Spence.",1441497600,,453,4.6125

7230495,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best movies of the year! Director George Miller returns to the Wasteland as we follow the character Max Rockatansky through Imperator Furiosa's story of redemption. In theaters, Mad Max Fury Road was the greatest movie experience of my life. With Dolby Atmos and Klipsch Audio surround sound speakers, all the annoying talkers in the audience were drowned out by the opening titles. From the start of the movie until the end, this movie is a high-octane rush and an absolute, visceral experience. I couldn't help but be in awe as the movie went on with car destruction, beautiful orange and red explosions, motorcycle stunts, and, of course, a guitar that spits hot fire. The bluray was top of my list to get this year and my only complaint about the bluray is the menu. It feels so lazily put together. If you've seen the cover art of the disc case, you've seen what the menu looks like. I remember when dvd menus were exciting (example: Spiderman 2) and got me thrilled to watch the movie. This bluray is packed with SO MANY special features that cover pretty much everything about this movie. A great movie to add to my collection, still glad I bought it.",1441497600,2,1190,4.591549295774648

7230497,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Gratuitously violent, completely pointless, unpretentious vehicle haute couture extravaganza. I loved this film! I have been a fan of the world since this franchise launched back in 1980, I remember the shock of watching in 1982, the anticipation leading into Thunderdome, and the incredible over the top characters, cars and world building.

This newest installation was no different - after all, we watch Mad Max for the stunts, the worlds, the cars, the characters. It isn't there for deep commentary, it isn't trying to pass on a message or some world political view - it is simply an amazing feast of visual storytelling and excitement.

Mad Max is an intense world, and no longer really a character - this version of Max, played by Tom Hardy, is really just connective tissue into this world. Hardy plays it subtly, like an original Max but with much less personality shining through (and you'll recall, the original max wasn't exactly effusive). Theron is the bad ass in this film, and does... Read more",1441497600,,1010,4.935294117647059
7230498,3,B00YQJRYGY,"This is a good film.  I didn't like it as much as others in the series or as much as most critics did, but then again, I was expecting to see a Mad Max film.  This is a film that happens to have Mad Max in it.  There's a difference.

The action scenes and stunt work were over the top in places.  When it's too much, too often, action scenes lose their impact.  It had a Cirque de Soleil vibe with all the ""polecats"" that just seemed a little too much.  The villains were also chewing up the scenery a bit too hard.  It made them comical instead of scary or threatening - particularly the ""Bullet Farm"" guy and the ""Gas Town"" heavy with the holes torn out of his suit to showcase his nipple clamps.  Lord Humongous from The Road Warrior would have eaten these guys for breakfast.

One of the best parts about the original film series (particularly Mad Max and The Road Warrior) was the hauntingly wonderful score.  That was noticeably absent in this film.  Also absent was any Australian charm (or accents).  On the plus side, Immortan Joe was played by ""The Toecutter"" from Mad Max, which was a cool casting choice by George Miller.

The main problem with this film is that it's really Furiosa's movie.  I wanted to see Mad Max as the lead, not ""someone other than Mad Max"" in a Mad Max film.  In every other Mad Max film, the people Max saves know how hard he fought for them by the end of the movie.  Likewise, the ""villains"" of those films also know who he is, often because he's the guy who killed them and/or thwarted their plans.  But in this movie, literally no one except Furiosa knows (or cares) who he is by the end.  So if the majority of the characters in a film don't care who Mad Max is, why should the audience?

All in all, Fury Road was entertaining, but if you want to see a great Mad Max film, watch The Road Warrior.  If you want to see the best Mad Max film, watch the first half of Beyond Thunderdome until they kick him out of Bartertown on a horse, then fast forward to the last 5 minutes where Tina Turner and her minions are chasing his group and he stops her by wrecking his car into them, then she says, ""Ain't we a pair, Raggedy man"" and drives off.  Then, either turn it off or fast forward again through that awful monologue at the end until you see credits rolling.  Trust me...just skip the whole part with the kids, the oasis, tomorrow-morrow land, the ""telling of the tell"", etc.  But if you just have to watch it all the way through, don't say old Reginald didn't warn you.",1441497600,10,2510,4.2579281183932345
7230499,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Excellent movie, the stars are actually the director, the cars, stunt scenes and the bad guys. The truth is the two supposed lead characters (played by Tom Hardy and Charlise Therion) are actually pretty boring in themselves but are there to create the need for a plotline (not to mention you supposedly need `stars' to get big money backing from producers). Their acting is certainly nothing to speak of in this movie, even though they are typically reliable actors and their roles in this movie are relatively small.

It's really pretty incredible that director George Miller could follow-up (over 30 years past!) his masterpiece (The Road Warrior with Mel Gibson) and create another very good movie. What director gets a 2nd chance 30 years later?! Miller has a very good eye for visuals, action set pieces, and an eye for interesting faces using relative close-ups (ala Lang / Jeunet etc). I would say that the 1st half of the movie is much better than the 2nd half, but it's still a very good movie. One problem with the 2nd half is that the heart of the movie is the warlord's band of warriors, their surreal look, their actions, beliefs, interactions etc, but we see less of them in the 2nd half when the movie focuses more on the more normal (and boring, let's face it) pretty-face `good guy' humans.

Great and clever action scenes, very good makeup and music and the real acting stars of the movies: The Bad Guys. Immortan, (a strong king who has managed to carve a civilization out of the barren wasteland), his various children (as Immortan has reached an extremely advanced age in terms of fathering children are commonly afflicted with a physical ailment). Of course the uranium-laced water of the aquifer under the fortress will always lead to issues in all the town's offspring anyhow. The War Boy Nux and the rest of the War Boys, those actors are great too, I must admit one tends to root for Immortan, his children and the War Boys much more than any of the `good guys`. I mean seriously, you don't expect us to root for a much of beautiful, pampered princesses either, do you? Faces, faces, faces, makeup, cars, and stunts (whether CGI or real) are the heart of the movie.

The plot is what one would expect really of any post-apocalyptic or pre-modern (pre-20th century that is) story, in other words, historically (in the absence of law, a strong and pervasive military (such as police), organized cities, and tools such as modern roads cars etc), women are forced into hiding and are treated as targets as they always would be in any world that has been turned upside down by a lawless society (also visualized in movies such as The Road, Solomon Kane etc, plus any historical movie of course). This isn't the Hunger Games folks. Nothing against that movie though, it's just a little silly, but fun. Speaking of silly, the ending to this movie was pretty silly, I won't give it away (not that it would any sort of great reveal), but a totally dumb decision is made at the salt plains, c'mon man! By the way, there are a lot of bad guys, weapons, and defenses at Immortan's fort.  War pups certainly wouldn't be meek.

Speaking of the cover art (on the version with the bald lady on the cover and Max in the background), there are other releases that have improved art and that are perhaps much better representative of what the actual movie is about. Seriously, I would think people would get fired over creating such incompetent and ugly cover art. My third grader could have done better with a box of crayons. C'mon folks, you've spent millions and bazillions of dollars making the movie, you can't use a decent cover shot or art for the blu ray cover? Sheesh!! Well, at any rate, maybe in the future we will get another Mad Max movie with this current Max (ie: Tom Hardy) or Mel Gibson or Hugh Jackman or whomever and directed by Miller. Maybe Max will actually even have a primary role in the next movie.",1441497600,,3931,4.626074498567335

7230501,5,B00YQJRYGY,"At this point, there's probably nothing original I could write about MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to, this long-awaited sequel/reboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time. It's a balls-to-the-wall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas don't even come close to matching. What George Miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images, with dialogue/exposition brought to a minimum. In the absence of a lot of talking, which some will interpret as a lack of story/plot while others will simply be turned off, the characters are developed through their actions, what they wear, what they drive, etc. It's basically a production designer's heaven, as there are no superfluous details. Everything and everyone in this world has a purpose, but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it; it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly. In response to the ignoranamuses/ignorami(?) who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance, a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest. Yes, the female characters are strong and have agency, but they are given equal status to the male characters. All you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by Immortan Joe and the Many Mothers. In both power structures, the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they (Max and Furiosa) realize that they have to work together in order to survive. The basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork. Of course, there's all of the action. Seeing as the film is basically a two-hour chase, there are quite a few set-pieces which only get better as the film progresses. And what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner (with a couple notable exceptions). And because endless action would wear you out, there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer. Taken as a whole, MAD MAX FURY ROAD is perhaps one of the most complete action films, and a perfectly good example of what Hitchcock termed ""pure cinema"" (and was also a term used by Miller in promotion for the film). My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly, and isn't helped by some occasionally stilted delivery. However, that's a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is. George Miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done, even besting (in my opinion) the high mark set by his original trilogy. Do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you haven't already (or again, if you have).",1441497600,4,2939,4.6976744186046515

I love movies and have seen just about every movie ever made...no joke...and this one by far is the most genious....most creative movie I have had the pleasure of seeing so far. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron were absolutely AMAZING!!! I was reading over the ""x-ray"" after the film and they had mentioned several other actors to take the part of ""Max""...like Channing Tatum...that would have never worked in my opinion. Tom Hardy was the PERFECT CASTING FOR MAX. Tall, dark, Buff and handsome...man alive. I love that man!!! Def watch Mad Max. You will NOT BE dissappointed.

Having said that, I love Nicholas Hoult as Nux the Warboy, this kid is so good in everything he does (Young beast in the x-men) I'm wishing him a much bigger star soon. The brides are terrific. The old gals are terrific. the bad guys are very Mad Max bad and hideous.

I've looked at the percentages of people rating this film five-stars and I cannot understand that score.  There was no plot to this film; the characters take a slightly dangerous drive out into the desert, turn around, and drive back.  Wow!  I fell asleep for a few moments while watching this movie, so, I think that says it best.  Even if you can take this movie out from your local public library for free, don't do it, watch Mad Max:  Beyond Thunderdome instead, the worst of the first three films in the series.",1441324800,2,725,4.286764705882353
7230591,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Artistically beautiful, color and mood, outrageous but effective and stylish action set-pieces and some decent characterization.  A highly entertaining but not very intelligent film in many ways.  It falls apart at the very end, and fails to establish the relationship between the main villain and the people he dominates at the beginning of the film necessary for such a closure to make any impact on the viewer.

Criticisms against the film as if it had a ""feminist agenda"" are unwarranted; the male and female lead characters save each other's asses many times and if anything the film showed the benefits of mutual respect and cooperation in harsh conditions.

My favorite thing about the film is the ridiculous guitar/amp/truck.  :D",1441324800,4,737,5.159663865546219

7230593,3,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie is epic in that it is probably the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen.  The shots are really amazing.  The compostition, color, clarity are seriously incredible!

However, for as visually awesome as this movie is, it is equally as stupid.

Let me count just a few ways.

A. Running engines in the desert, through sand storms, without air cleaners would bog down motors in minutes.  Don't believe me?  Just ask the guys back from Iraq....

B. The Vegas style water distribution is really stupid. Come on!  They are living in the desert.

C. If someone rips a catheter from their neck like shown in the movie, they would bleed out!  That was a larger catheter than you will ever see stuck into an artery or vein.  You would rip it out, and it would be like a fire hose.

If you don't know this, you have never had major surgery(good for you), or are not a medical professional..

D. No man alive today, or EVER will be able to rip a bolted down super charger off of an engine.  If they could, the super charger would never work.  As a test, why don't you go and try to rip a part off of your car.  I suggest trying to rip one of your tires off.  Maybe start with a door handle..

Didn't work?  Now go out and try to rip the handle bars off of your bicycle.  REDICULOUS!

However, as I said, the cinematography is stunning!  STUNNING!

There is also plenty of action.

It was worth the 4 dollar rental fee, and unlike some other reviewers I am not hung up on the fact that this is a Mad Max movie, and Charlize Theron played a major part.  Mad Max was not ""made into a chump""

Without the really stupid parts, it isn't a bad movie. Even though it is incredibly stupid...

I will be looking forward to a sequel with less stupidity.",1441324800,,1749,4.26605504587156

My wife loved it of course for the ""themes"" she identifies with - strong women and ""matriarchal"" society stuff, the importance of water as a scarce resource that will eventually be more precious than oil, good vs. evil, etc.  Ok, maybe over the top, but if it gets my wife to watch a Mad Max movie, I'm good!",1441324800,3,609,4.153846153846154

7230603,5,B00YQJRYGY,People who have watched mad max as well as any other of the (road warrior movies) that are giving this a bad review based on plot holes and threads are missing the point of any of the other movies as they never made any sense at all either which is what made the movies great in some sense of wonder. This movie is non stop and I adore the lack of any dialogue for the majority of the beginning it is fiction at its finest still based and someone still relative to oil problems but who cares and also who cares about Hardy and his action chops in contrast (really people consider bane prolific for an actor?) Btw he is fantastic you do not need dialogue to potray being an actor . Do not listen to so called online critics who want to voice there opinion to be heard with no repercussion as no one will really care. As a child of the 80s who has been trying to find that gritty dark disturbing neo apocalyptic with no context over the top wonder since terminator 2 came out I personally am at ease some were not meant to stomach this stuff but to me it a pure wonder and also a possible set up to a new Canon universe . Also btw this the only time I have ever voiced my opinion on anything online as I do not have Facebook and am not an online troll with nothing better to do.,1441324800,,1276,4.067460317460317

7230607,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Honestly, this is Charlize Theron's movie although Tom Hardy was cast as the iconic Mad Max. Someone, I felt Hardy's character got lost behind the superb acting and the intensity that that Theron brought to the film. The scenes are incredible, intense, chaotic-perfectly depicting a very post-apocolptic, dystopian world that is this film series. While it could have been better, I do believe Theron carried this movie, as well as the supporting cast. While enjoyable it isn't given five stars because it was some what forgettable after watching it. If it weren't for Theron's acting and stunts, I would've stopped watching.

I felt like I was missing some things, starting with the way the movie started, and due to the constant flashback references to his past that never get explained.

Despite that major flaw, the movie is filled with amazing action scene after action scene.  The constant excitement of action helped me forget about the lack of back-story.

7230687,5,B00YQJRYGY,Awesome movie. Nonstop action.,1441238400,,30,6.75
7230688,5,B00YQJRYGY,"First of all, this film is one of the greatest action movies ever made. For over 30 years, I proclaimed The Road Warrior had the greatest chase scene in movie history. I didn't think anything could top it. Leave it to the same filmmaker to prove me wrong. With this one movie, 70-year old director George Miller has schooled EVERY other director in Hollywood, basically saying ""THIS is how you do action."" There is no shaky cam to be found here. The action scenes, as well as every other scene, have been spectacularly framed and shot. Even in the most kinetic scenes, the viewer is never at a loss to understand what it happening, and is left awestruck at the sheer insanity of it all. It proves that the most amazing shots are not done with a computer. They are done in camera. Real stunts. Real stuntmen. Real crashes. Real explosions. There is a lot of digital compositing, to be sure, but it used as an enhancer to the real images photographed by the cinematographer. The action is, in a word, exquisite.

Some have claimed there is no story here. How wrong they are. Miller himself has said he wanted to make what is, in essence, a silent movie. As he said ""a movie where they don't need subtitles in Japan"". The movie has story, plot, and character development. It handles all of these things visually, with only the barest necessity of dialogue to link together those points that simply could not be made visually. Exposition is kept to a minimum, just long enough for the audience to catch their breath. A lot has been said how Tom Hardy's Max is a background character instead of the lead. Go back and watch any of the other Mad Max movies, and you will see that has always been true. Apart from the last half of the original, none of the Mad Max movies has ever been about Max. They are about the characters that Max meets in his travels, how he is dropped into their world, and how he makes it work for him, while helping them on the quest. The real star of the film is Charlize Theron. She give a multi-layered performance, and gives us the greatest movie heroine since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. An Oscar nomination is not out of the question.

As far as the Blu-ray itself, it is amazing to look at. Even the smallest details are crystal clear. This is one of the few movies that actually benefits from 3D. Apart from one ""comin' at ya"" moment, the 3D is used to give depth to the shots, and drops the viewer smack into the action. With the 3D, you become a part of it. Unlike other 3D blu-rays, I found that there is actually deeper colors in the 3D version. They are fuller, and more vibrant. This is also a movie that was made to make you crank your surround sound system to the limit. Every channel is filled with the roar of an engine, the crack of a gunshot, or any number of sounds, creating an almost dizzying sound experience.

There are deleted scenes that, honestly, deserved to be deleted. The real treat is a multi-part documentary that details how the film was made. Watching how the images were achieved, and how much of it was done for real, makes you appreciate the movie even more.

This is a masterpiece of visual filmmaking, and if I had to compare it to another popular franchise about cars...this movie makes the Fast & Furious movies look like a slow ride to grandma's house.",1441238400,2,3313,4.462046204620462

7230690,3,B00YQJRYGY,"3 Sept 15
I was really looking forward to this film, being a big fan of the originals, but it doesn't seem to capture the 'world' as it was - even if we find it a little more layered than when last we left it.
Casting is good, what little writing there is, is good, the acting is 3 of 5-stars, continuity isn't too bad and the production values? Forget about it. Excellent.

The biggest, most glaring flaw in the movie is that there's utterly no backstory on anyone. Zip. Nada. Squadouche. We have no idea who anyone is or how they got where they are. Who's the main Bad-Guy and what's his problem? Who's the little feller wired to the seat? Can we please get a little something on this religion?

Big plot holes with Charlize Theron. No idea what motivates her. Max himself? A professional victim who consistently winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The hot chicks in white are utterly implausible in the world that's been created here. Why try and escape from the only place that has water, and you're being treated like a princess?
Obviously the action was the draw, and it doesn't disappoint. But while the seemingly endless CGI choreography is peerless, most scenes lack the sheer, raw brutality of the originals. In this ultimate dystopian reality, it just seemed like there was a lot of PC going on. We get the 'Impression' that so-and-so was crushed beneath the wheels - but it's never shown like it was in the originals. It just seems like they dialed-up the flames, bombs, and ingenuity, but toned down the primal motivation.
3 of 5 stars.

7230744,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Absolutely loved this movie. It's the closest any film has ever come to being non-stop action. While that may turn some people away, it's good to know that even though there is so much action in this movie, it does not slight on character. The story isn't much, but is more than enough to propel this movie forward. I love visual storytelling and this is the absolute best example of that. You get to know the characters and their motivations by what they do, not by them simply telling you everything. Director George Miller literally drops you into this world and doesn't take the time to explain a single thing (also brilliant) and just brings you into this experience, letting it wash over you.

While Max may not be the real star of the film, he is terrific in the role and does the original trilogy justice in portraying him as a tortured man, obviously reeling from the death of his family, as well as many others he could not save. Charlize Theron gives my favorite performance of hers in what will be up there as the best of feminine heroines like Ripley from the Alien series. This is really Furiosa's story, but her and Max's mostly unspoken bond & respect is a real highlight of the film. It comes through in their actions based on each side out of the necessity in order to survive.

When I think about the Mad Max series, I think about the finale of the Road Warrior and how I had never seen anything like it before. This entire film feels like that. It's intense, daring, and has a lot of weight to it because of the lack of CGI. I also have to give a shout out to the music in this film because I feel it's difficult to effectively score an action film. However, Junkie XL really knows how to keep the blood pumping throughout. He's does a great job with the loud, bumping action beats -- as well as the more tender and quiet moments. Fury Road is one of those movies I will never get tired of watching. I would love to see Miller & Tom Hardy come back for a couple more movies because I love this world and I love these crazy characters....but I honestly don't know how they could top this. Easily the best film of the year, and one of my favorites of all time.",1441238400,,2178,4.322738386308068

Special effects, stunts, vehicles all excellent.  Visual presentation (color, clarity, no dropouts)  couldn't ask for better.  My receiver turned the ATMOS sound information into 7.2 Dolby True.  Bass lovers....I had to turn down the volume on my Sub woofers' amplifier.  It will rattle your walls even at a lower volume. Directionality of the sound was impressive.  So:  Why only three stars?  Because (lack of) story trumped SFX, and, in my opinion, the acting was wooden.  Quantity of material, in this case, could not make up for quality.  If, when I watch the 3D version, the extra dimension adds enough to the experience, I will add one star.  OK!  I added the star.  The 3D was impressive.",1441238400,2,835,5.126865671641791

A long car chase filled with amazing scenes of flying metal and bodies; the pulsing soundtrack is embodied by a giant vehicle with pounding drummers and a guitarist with a literally flaming instrument. An engrossing spectacle from start to finish.

The characters are not shallow tropes. While they say little and except for a few do not develop, they are fully realized. If you read the wikia there's loads of backstory that is barely mentioned in the movie. But the effort in crafting the world and characters shows. The head despot (Immortan Joe) and his cult of personality: with the Warboys, and his control of water fit in the scheme of things.

Max isn't really the protoganist here, reacting to and pushed by events. The unforgettable Furiosa is the literal driver of the plot. And that also fits in the place and the story.

A stylized look at extreme environments/situations and their impacts on people striving to survive. A surprisingly deep story for a very thin plot. The movie left an impression on me after it was over.",1441152000,,1231,4.797169811320755

7230770,4,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a 2015 action film directed by George Miller. This film is the fourth installment in the ""Mad Max"" film series, which are also directed by Miller. To start this review, I must say that this is one of the best action movies in recent memory. ""Fury Road"" stars Tom Hardy as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, who replaces Mel Gibson from the original films. Max is living in a desolate, post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a cult leader who controls his followers with the last remaining water supply. Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a subordinate of Joe's, begins a mission to collect gasoline. However, Furiosa has secretly smuggled away Joe's Five Wives, women specially selected for breeding, in an attempt to liberate them from Joe's clutches. When Joe finds out, he sets out on the Fury Road with his War Boys in pursuit, with Max along for the ride. What follows is some of the best action sequences in film.

As some have said I have to agree the storyline was weak; it just seemed like a poorly done, over the top remake.

The movie had almost no dialog, poor character development...it was just an action movie about driving a truck down a road, and nonstop action scenes of explosions and violence, which are great, when paired together with some originality and a good storyline.

I don't normally walk into sequels or remakes with overly high expectations of them living up to the originals, but in this case I found it a bit hard to watch.  They tried too hard in the action department, and not hard enough on the basics of making a good movie: good writing.

7230809,5,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: An apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life. Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland.

The cast led by Tom Hardy (solidly taking over the role of Max Rockatansky, originated by Mel Gibson in the first three ""Mad Max"" movies) & Charlize Theron (in a well-crafted performance as Furiosa) is brilliant.

7230815,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I can not explain to you how awesome this movie is, I can honestly say I wish I had seen this in the big screen.
I grew up knowing that Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome was an awesome movie however this movie blew it away. The action in this movie blew me away and brought up a completely different dynamic to post apocalyptic movies then I've seen in the past. The action, soundtrack, characters and screenplay are things that are just the beginning of what make this movie a great flick. I wish I had seen this movie on the big screen but being able to watch it in my own home whenever I want are a bonus. Here's a little snapshot of this movie without any spoilers:

Max is the character you are first introduced however, although a silent role steals the show. The movie starts off with the capture of Max being used as a blood donor for one of the Immortals bad boys on a chase to bring back several breeders the Immortal uses to create more baddies into this post apocalyptic world. This movie has constant action and is a runaway chase movie that will never bore you.

Pick this movie up today and you will not be disappointed. I'm a father of two so when I do get to watch movies I want something that gives me entertainment. This movie does that.

7230825,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I'm a huge fan of the older Mad Max movies, and I was skeptical this movie could capture the originals. But it does, and so much more. Within ten minutes, I realized it made the original trilogy look kind of cheap and chintzy. This is Mad Max in all his glory. Tom Hardy (a highly underrated actor) is a perfect replacement as Max. And the story is the essence of a simple story well-told.

Max gets captured and turned into a living blood bank for a soldier of a twisted death cult, run by the truly sinister Immortan Joe. Immortan Joe is kind of like Lord Humungous from ""Road Warrior,"" if he had gathered a larger following. And was more psychotic. Immortan Joe has created an army of suicidal soldiers, and controls the people with regular dumps of fresh water. But when one of his minions, Furiosa, frees his enslaved women (his ""breeders) and sets out to take them to a land of freedom, Immortan Joe's legions are in a race to stop her. Of course, Mad Max ends up on Furiosa's side, and joins them in their journey.

What all this boils down to is pretty much a two-hour car chase, which is just fine. The racing scenes were always the best part of the Mad Max movies, and this movie is that in spades. You've got people jumping from one car to another, shooting up other cars, bad guys getting run over by cars, and cars smashing into each other almost non-stop. Every now and then, we get a break in the action, but then it's back to car chases again. It works surprisingly well.

The only flaw I could find is that the story development is severely lacking. There are so many questions left unanswered. Why is Immortan Joe so obsessed with breeding children? What is the disease that's killing the ""warboys?"" Why is so much of the Earth ""salted?"" What is it that Furiosa feels the need to redeem herself from? The original movies didn't explain much, either, but with all the running around, there's room for almost nothing else. But that's okay. A lot of it is implied, and you don't really need a reason to see cars jumping over each other.

And I'd also like to add that, even with a shaved head, black smeared on her face, and missing an arm, Charlize Theron is gorgeous.
Good movie. Hope there's more Mad Max on the way.",1441065600,5,2234,4.415048543689321

7230856,5,B00YQJRYGY,"One word to describe this film, refreshing.  It is so utterly different and has a style like no other film in recent memory.  It is no wonder since it came from the creator of the original Mad Max films George Miller who's vision inspired several other post apocalyptic worlds.

Enter Mad Max: Fury Road, a reboot worth it's weight in V8 guzzolene chugging engines.  This story actually has Max taking the passenger seat as it were and is more about Imperator Furiosa who is a captain in Immortan Joe's war party.  She is sent out on a supply run to Gastown but has a hidden agenda to rescue Joe's wives from his clutches at The Citadel.  Her plan is to take them to the Green Place, an oasis where women can live free without worrying about becoming a warlord's personal breeder.  Her detour is quickly noticed and soon after she is pursued by Immortan's War Boys along with war parties from Gastown and the Bulletfarmers who have an alliance with The Citadel.  Max, who was captured by the War Boys earlier in the film ends up along for the ride as a blood bag for a near-death War Boy driver named Nux.  He ends up making his escape and being thrust into a situation where he helps Furiosa and Joe's wives escape a fate worse than death.

That is the story in a nutshell and to be quite honest I don't think there is time for any more than that.  There is little to no breathing room between action scenes and every bit of story is very much enjoyable.  There are little nuances that I am still just noticing now such as the War Boy's V8 symbol they form by interlocking 8 fingers in a V shaped pattern as their personal salute to their perceived savior Joe.  The special effects are used sparingly and some parts that feel like they should be CG are actually done by live stuntmen.  The costumes and makeup are fantastic, especially on Immortan Joe who looks absolutely ruthless and terrifying.  This movie has made me fall in love with Mad Max all over again.

Big nods to the main cast as Tom Hardy, Nicholas Hoult, and Charlize Theron all do fantastic jobs.  Nicholas Hoult really steals the show as Nux who is probably my favorite character in the film.  This is the best film I have seen in quite some time and I cannot wait to watch it again and again.  It is bold in it's approach and it pays off in a big way.  I was absolutely blown away by this film and my expectations were met, shattered, and reassembled into what I now know a Mad Max film should be.",1441065600,,2467,4.356673960612691

7230878,1,B00YQJRYGY,"It seems there are people who like either Star Trek or Star Wars... either Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.  Star Trek and Harry Potter springing from emotions and motivations that are human and understood.  Star Wars and Lord spring from an understanding of other-worldly motivations of alien/cyborg/hybrid beings.  I am of the former category.  Whether you stick a wooden stake into the left side of a vampires chest or shoot a silver bullet into a werewolf, it seems that there are cliff notes somewhere that gives one a heads up on whats happening.  With Mad Max, I kind of understand that it is a post-apocalyptic world and that gas and water are so scarce that people are willing to kill for it. It just makes it untenable that many dozens of cars, all souped up more than any modern day NASCAR are racing hundreds of miles to kill each other (and then not rob the dead person of their gasoline or water). It leaves me a bit mystified as to what is happening. It seems to just be annihilation of each other for no real reason.  It's fine for me to suspend belief as in watching Austin Powers, George of the Jungle or even the Toby McGuire's Spiderman movies. But it is just asking too much to just watch extreme violence, carnage and destruction for no obvious reason.  There is a market of course for the comic book CGI type movies such as Iron Man, Thor, etc.  But this Mad Max film does not give us any reason to root for the hero. The character development is a two sentence voice over and a few seconds of quick cuts which are to signify people who were killed who were close to our hero, but to me it is not enough to make me angry enough to root for him.
In the original Mad Max, which was also lacking in direction, at least had that one extremely well made shot, which made a box office superstar of Mel Gibson and put George Miller on the director's map.  The shot of Mel Gibson, with leg hanging off, crawling determinedly across the road with the low angle camera showing his emotion of ""revenge at all cost.""  It hyped me up and made me root for Mel to set fire to all the bad guys and kill everyone in sight who had slighted him.  Even though the rest of the movie was crap, that one scene is emblazoned in my memory forever.  Mad Max Fury Road unfortunately has nothing like that. Tom Hardy is charismatic and I look forward to seeing him on screen.  Charlize Theron is always magnificent, and this just adds one more layer to her already incomprehensible talent.  And Nicholas Hoult was perfectly seamless in his character of the bad guy turned good guy. But I'm only talking about a review of this MOVIE, which is weak in story, even worse in character development, lacking in symbolism which creates a link to your understanding and especially lacking in a great cinematic moment (like the Mel Gibson scene) which makes you appreciate something, anything in this story to feel fulfilled in paying for this film.",1440979200,4,2937,4.465420560747663

You have to have a certain taste to appreciate any movie. You won't like it if it isn't your taste. Thats what trailers are for. You shouldn't have watched this film if the trailer didn't appeal to you.

To the 1 star reviews.

How dare you come here and tell people whats good and what isn't.

Thats like telling people what genre music they should listen to.

This isn't an appliance review where if it works it gets 4- 5 stars and if it doesn't it should get 1-2.

This is an Action movie. Not a drama. Meaning there doesn't have to be an in depth story. Its also the first movie in a modern day trilogy and its not a mad max reboot. Its a continuation. If you had a brain and watched the previous movies, what story did you need or expect exactly?

The plot, character development or interest in the well being of the main characters was a wasteland. Mad Max, Fury Road delivers otherwise good actors with nothing to say and only dirt, grim and sweat to deliver their performance through. Some might say their performance with so little verbiage was brilliant. I felt they were chained to much by their empty scripts. If you like non-stop action and stunts, this is a great way to pass a couple hours of you life in a blur of madness. If you want a story that moves through and is helped by the action... look elsewhere. This movie kicks the story under the assault semi. Blah Max.",1440892800,,994,4.467032967032967

I felt the story could have benefited from more background context, so that's why I took away a star. This next criticism is leveled solely at Amazon, not the movie and does not factor into my rating. I would have been happier if I bought the Blu-Ray. Amazon's sound quality and volume continue to disappoint. I had to turn it up to nearly 90 to hear the dialogue and sound clearly. Sound is at least as important as visuals in a movie.

7230971,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is a 21st-century look back to the original Mad Max starring Mel Gibson. This one stars Tom Hardy as the title character, who is actually more supporting player than lead character. That honor goes to Charlize Theron, who plays the one-armed warrior Imperator Furiosa, a tough gal in the mold of Ripley from the Alien movies. Shes adept at hand-to-hand combat and is also pretty formidable behind the wheel of her big rig truck or wielding all manner of weaponry.

When we first see him, Max, bound by a metal face device and utilized as a human blood supply, is a prisoner of the War Boys of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Initially enemies, Max and Furiosa eventually become allies against a mutual foe and a grudging respect develops between them.

The first half-hour of the film is essentially a chase, with an assortment of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and crazed War Boys wildly shooting flame throwers, lobbing hand grenades, and jumping, like pirates, from one vehicle to the next. The extended sequence is beautifully filmed and exciting to watch. Director George Miller knows how to tell his simple story in visual terms, downplaying dialogue for fear of bogging down the pictures rocket-like pace.

 Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) co-stars as a wild-eyed, maniacal War Boy who joins the cause of decency and is driven more by conscience than testosterone as one new danger after another manifests itself.  Max and Furiosa are hard-as-nails fighters who hold on to their humanity in a world where savagery and rampant violence are the norm.

The 3D effects are pretty cool, with projectiles, fists, vehicles and everything else zooming toward the camera. In addition to its gimmickry, the 3D gives the road scenes a sense of depth, emphasizing the nearly endless expanse of flat, desert. Bonus extras on the 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include several behind-the-scenes featureless. Special features are in 2D Blu-ray.

Also available is a Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack containing the same bonus features. Both editions contain digital HD copy.",1440892800,4,2102,5.093023255813954

Its  right there with the Road Warrior, but with alot more steady action. And i will say this.  The Road Warrior is probably my favorite all time movie. Fury Road is like The Road Warrior...on Nitro Methane. This should have been the movie after The Road Warrior, and they should have just left Beyond Thunderdome out completley.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE. the only movie i have ever gone to on an opening night. When it was over, it got a standing ovation.

I remember seeing the original Mad Max when I was a teen, and at the time I liked the movie a lot. When Road Warrior came out, I absolutely loved what a bigger budget, and better filming could do. And then ThunderDome happened ... not a horrible movie, but not what I was hoping for.

Going into this movie I had fairly low expectations, and I walked away liking it more than I thought I would, but wishing for a whole lot more.
When reviewers say it's one long chase scene, they weren't lying.

- The movie doesn't need dialogue for exposition because this is so well-crafted that the plot is perfectly clear from what we see on screen. There's no need to have clunky exposition or dialogue where two characters tell each other what's happening. I'm glad that this movie respects my intelligence and its own skill enough to trust that I understand what's happening without being told.
- The movie doesn't need excessive dialogue for characterization because film is a visual medium and because all of these characters have real personalities. This isn't like Age of Ultron where five different characters had to TELL each other (and us) that Black Widow and Bruce Banner were attracted to each other because nothing on-screen SHOWED us that in a believable way. These characters' behavior, costumes, and facial expressions tell us everything we need to know about them. One steely glance from Charlize Theron tells us all about her determination and hatred for Immortan Joe. We know that Joe is a monster without explicitly being told because a) he literally calls human beings his ""property"" b) we see that he wears a monstrous horse-teeth mask and c) he begins the movie with a speech where he torments his thirsty people with a tiny bit of water (when he has plenty) and then tells them not to get addicted to it.
- The action of this movie is meaningful because it drives the plot and reveals characters' relationships and personalities. There are no fight scenes that are like those in a typical comic book action movie (and I love Marvel movies) where all the action scenes feel obligatory and don't move the plot in a meaningful way. Something big is at stake in every action scene; you couldn't cut anything out because every moment of it is necessary and changes the stakes and the plot. Just one example of how all the action reveals character and unfolding relationships: while people are attacking the War Rig, Max and Furiosa's relationship strengthens as she is forced to trust him and he finds his humanity by helping her. In just one moment where the War Rig gets stuck in the mud, we get a heartbreaking insight into Nux when he points to a tree and says: ""that thing."" He doesn't even know what a tree is! It shows how narrow and sad his life as a War Boy was. But his eagerness to help also shows his innocence and inner kindness.
- This movie is also incredibly beautiful on a purely aesthetic level. The visuals are stunning, particularly the sandstorm, which absolutely took my breath away. The combination of the soundtrack and the visuals of the film totally immerses you in the world of Mad Max.
- Anyone who says this movie has no depth is wrong. The plot of this movie works on a mythological, archetypal level: Max is the archetypal wanderer. Furiosa seeks sanctuary in a legendary, dimly remembered oasis that sounds a little like Paradise. As the filmmakers themselves have said, Joe and his War Boys represent toxic masculinity and how it harms and dehumanizes everyone and values nobody's life. The Bullet Farmer wears a distorted three-piece suit because he represents corporations' role in war and cruelty.
- There is so much symbolism in this movie. Liquids are a motif: blood, water, gasoline, milk. There's a moment where Max literally washes blood from his body with mother's milk, reflecting the movie's argument that nurturing and women's strength can defeat violence. There's a motif of birth: the use of tubes for blood transfusions echoes umbilical cords, and literal birth occurs in the film as well.

But sure, this was just a dumb action movie with no plot, and it sucked because Max wasn't really the main character (never mind that Furiosa was a gripping, fantastic lead, Max is always the visiting, helping wanderer in his movies, and Max, although he had few lines, did have a very moving character arc that revolved around his change from being an essentially feral madman back into being a human being again - which is why is transition into learning to speak again is so important).

If this movie was confusing or boring for you, watch it again. This is how movies are supposed to be: they're supposed to have conflicts that are clear and gripping and characters who feel real and take action. They're not supposed to have all that other nonsense like people who just stand around and tell each other facts (hi, Breaking Dawn) or scenes where nothing happens and nothing is at stake (Iron Man 2 Justin Hammer scenes) or confusing plots that actually make no sense if you think about them (Star Wars prequels, Star Trek Into Darkness, Age of Ultron) or characters who are stereotypes or as flat as cardboard cut-outs or whose motivation makes no sense (why did Ultron want to destroy the world, again? Oh, because he's evil. Okay) or unsympathetic heroes who make inexplicable, stupid decisions (hi, selfish jerk Green Lantern) or scenes where a woman takes her clothes off just so the audience can look at her in her underwear for a full minute (hi, Star Trek Into Darkness) or CGI garbage that doesn't look real where people leap off of buildings and aren't even hurt (The Hobbit, just as one example).

THIS is filmmaking. As critics have said, it puts other action movies of our age to shame.",1440806400,11,5486,4.7766069546891465

The new generations of american's are totally killing the movie industry by backing movies which are all based on stunts, explosions, and 'cool' one liners! There is no depth in the acting, there is very little character development, there is virtually no story actually being told. Why make an expensive-well crafted movie when crap like this results in equal amount of profit.

Since Charlize Theron is the star they really should have changed the title to 'Mad Maxine'.  What a shame because Tom Hardy would have shined IF he had been the main character.  This is another Hollywood shot at making women superior and men somewhat 'helpful' when the shiza hits the fan.  IF you prepare yourself mentally for this massive deviation from the Original Trilogy the movie rocks with some incredibly violent scenes and state of the art digital photography and computer generated graphics.,1440806400,,623,4.775700934579439

7231026,5,B00YQJRYGY,"In my very biased opinion, this is one of the best movies I have seen.

It combines four things very well: Culture, Character, Texture, and Music.

Music
I purchased the sound track before the movie came out. If you have not heard ""brothers in arms"" or ""chapter doof"", please do take a listen. The brutality of the orchestral music fits perfectly into the movie and does not disappoint for one second. It also, as a good soundtrack does, give great empathetic tone to the quieter scenes.

Texture
This may be hard to describe, but the movie has a perfect ""feel"" to it. You can sense the desperation of the characters, and know that everything is worn-out without getting a close look. You know these things are true because of very well written lines such as, ""As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy, me or everyone else.""

Character
Max, Furiosa, and Nux make up the unlikely allies with a common drive: redemption. I don't want to give away any more than that, but their transformations are subtle and perfectly in every way. They don't break character, they aren't monolithic, and they don't give up everything that they are in one conversation. Well written.

Culture
Like a well written world, you get the feeling, and you know it existed well before and well after the story. It has a history, and a future, and is not actually at an exact point on the mad max time line. It is actually viewed as one of the many tails of the road warrior, and reprises only max as a character from past stories. You can tell there is an economy, and religion, and a long, bloody story that lead the citadel, Gastown and the bullet farm to the peace they have.

I highly recommend this movie for post apocalypse fans, science fiction fans, motor heads, and action movie fans. If I have not convinced you, it has also received wide critical acclaim, and may be one of the best actions movies out there.

The action is a great blend of practical effects and CG that more films should strive for in this age of CGI saturation. The plot (like the other Mad Max films) is light as Max is drawn into the escape of Furiosa and 'the wives' from the tyrant Immortan Joe. Despite the slight plot, the characters are developed through their actions and subtle touches added by the phenomenal cast. This film serves to take the best of all the previous films: the savagery of the original, the character work from Road Warrior, and the world building from Thunderdome.

7231087,1,B00YQJRYGY,Two hours out of my life I'll never get back. This movie is among the worst I have ever seen. It made absolutely no sense.

7231093,5,B00YQJRYGY,"A masterpiece of color and form. A bold, uncompromising vision of a post-apocalyptic future that never takes itself less than seriously for an instant despite its outlandish material. A cinematic achievement on many levels.

7231094,5,B00YQJRYGY,dynamic. Really brings the bombastic spirit of the original back to life and then some. Kinetic visuals and over the top action sequences realized in vivid cinematography. The story is fairly straight ahead but fits in with the theme of the original Mad Max classic. I bought it early off iTunes but plan on getting the original on BD along with this.,1440547200,,351,4.67741935483871

7231097,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I love this movie. As a fan of the old ""Mad Max"" movies I approached it with a lot of doubt and was thrilled by how much fun it turned out to be. The sets and costuming are so over-the-top it's hilarious, and the gritty look of the entire production fits the old ""Mad Max"" concept perfectly. The characters are entertaining; special favorites are Nicholas Hoult as Nux, the psychotic ""Blacktop"" with a hidden heart of gold, Hugh Keays-Byrne as the revolting Immortan Joe, and, of course, iOTA (Sean Hape) as the flame-throwing rock guitarist riding on the front of the ""War Wagon"" and providing a ripping rock score to the insane chase scenes. Charlize Theron deserves a special mention as Imperator Furiosa; this is easily the most intense role I've seen her in since ""Monster"" and shows that she really is a versatile actress. The story line isn't perfect, but it sure makes for lots of absolutely crazy action. Highly recommended for action adventure fans!",1440547200,,959,4.783132530120482
7231098,5,B00YQJRYGY,Goof flick.  Followed the same confusing story line as the old Mad Max. Charlie was a bad ass. Not much from Max.,1440460800,,113,4.136363636363637
7231099,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is a great movie with lots of action.  It has plenty of wild vehicles and a really good story line.  There are enough vehicles destroyed to satisfy any chase scene crash lover on earth.  It's not Blade Runner or Apocalypse Now level of deep thinkers entertainment, but it is one wild ride.  It seems like there is only one part in the middle that allows you to slow down and breathe.  There is some really weird stuff in there too if you pay close attention.  Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are excellent in the movie.  I was a bit worried about them cast in these roles.  They do not disappoint in Fury Road.  SPOILER:  No Mel Gibson cameo.  Depending on who you are, this may make your day or bum you out! Immortan Joe the lead bad guy was in the original Mad Max as The Toecutter.",1440460800,,787,4.25

I love the action, the look of the world, the cast, everything. The two winners of the movie in my opinion though are the soundtrack and the overall pacing of the movie. It's like one massive car chase from start to finish, mixed in with a brilliant soundtrack. Again, an instant top 5 for me in terms of action flicks, i absolutely loved Fury Road.",1440374400,,504,4.25

7231156,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Just a simple, fun, immersive film.  Doesn't have the overwhelming character development when introduced to a new world like it Blade Runner, but it works.  The acting is high-end for an action movie, and you really develop a relationship with the characters, despite the lack of dialogue from the main characters.  It is one of the most visually striking films I have seen, and while it doesn't mesmerize you with the purples and blues of a movie like Avatar, the bright contrasts of the orange fire, and green and red flares really make the scenery come alive.  The whole practical effects debate is not my usually stomping grounds.  I believe that CGI is great. Well great CGI is great, cause 99% of the time you don't know its there.  This movie really impressed me because the effects were crisp, well executed and didn't become distracting.  Overall, I recommend it.  It feels different, and it works.",1440374400,,907,4.806451612903226

I certainly enjoyed it and it's worth a 5 star review, but this is simply a well executed blockbuster excelling at everything those represent. The music and sound is great, the special effects and stunts are great and the acting is unusually good for summer fluff.

For the new generation of movie-buffs, it would be advisable to watch the initial Mad in order to understand what's goin' on.

Because if you don't, you will be like Richard III in the middle of a chaotic battlefield of road-warriors.

There are few alusions respect the state of things of this somber situation. A post- apocalyptic world in which there's no water, gasoline or lack of devices to live into more or less acceptable living conditions.

Pitifully, Charlize Theron's amazing talent as actress is wasted in this film.

The main virtues resides around the countless action sequences and wonderful camera handle.

This is not a remake of the original, but apparently the telling of an escape event in Max's future.  Not bad in and of itself.  The movie actually unfolds situation details in an intelligent way.  For example, you meet the evil warlord as he's being prepared by staff for a speech; he's sickly and old, but dressed up to look powerful and vital.

On the plus side, costumes and sets are outstanding. The post-apocalyptic technology is more far-fetched than in the original movies.  That aside, the action sequences were awesome: elaborate yet clear to follow - and original.

Now that I can expect sappy, I think I'll enjoy watching it a second and third time, to enjoy the well-thought out details in the background.",1440115200,,945,4.713414634146342

 After seeing the trailer I thought there was no way I'd like this, in fact I was sure I'd hate it. Once it was released all the glowing reviews convinced me to give it a go. I'll say first off I loved the series and grew up with it and in my view this was a great addition to it. After an early sequence that didn't impress me I thought I'd guessed right initially but after that it was pretty much perfect. I'm hoping they continue the films if they are able to keep up this level of quality. I can still hear the score in my head and I'm reminded of it constantly.",1440028800,,672,4.014925373134329

7231305,5,B00YQJRYGY,"First off, I have to start by saying anyone who gave this movie less then 5 stars had no idea what they were in for.  If you are a fan, or somewhat a fan, or saw this movie with a fan of the series, then I already know this movie did or will exceed all expectations.  Rewatching the Mad Max trilogy can almost feel like a chore.  For its time they were fun and exciting, but watching in 2015, we've seen what was an original action packed idea copied 1000 times.  So George Miller decided he would give them all something to copy again.  This is a full tile, punch you in the mouth action packed film that delivers on every level.  It packs more action in the first 20 minutes than all the fast and furious movies combined.  This is a film, that when a rare calm scene comes, it comes for the purpose of giving us time to catch our breaths.

You don't watch porn for a story line, you don't watch horror films for uplifting family values, so why would you go to a movie written or directed by the man who redefined action movies in the 1980s to see a love story.  This is an action film, that is relentless and has so much going on you, you have to watch it numerous times to even realize how much there is to appreciate.

Few movies deserve a 5 star rating and it's nearly impossible for a movie to stick directly into in genre.  Horror movies want to be comedies, action movies want to be love stories, dramas want to be thrillers... this movie knows exactly what it is.  This movie explains with Michael Jordan didn't succeed at baseball or golf, cuz he was a basketball player!

If you love action, I mean grab you by the throat until you are moments away from passing out type action, then you will love this film.  If you are hoping for a love story or comedy or drama watch another movie.  Wait to see this until you are ready for pure, premium action.  And watch it for what it is!!!

This movie teaches a lesson to all directors and writers in the movie world, know what you are doing, know what kind of movie you are making, then make it.  Don't try to fit every genre or make a film everyone is going to like, leave and forget.  Make a movie that the fans of your genre applaud at the end and literally leave the theater out of breath.

Is this the best movie of all time?  As a fan will you need a notepad or calculator to figure out plot twist or ""who-dun-it?""  NO!!!!  The only people who need to take notes are the people in the film business on how to make a film dominate your genre.

Honestly folks, enjoy this.  It is a rare piece of living, screaming art.

Without Mel Gibson, the thing lacks character. Without larger than life awful guys, the thing lacks real terror. The violence is like collected edited cutouts from earlier versions, and the story, what there is of it, has no sense, no intelligent direction. The visuals and the overall production are, to say the least, cheap. Simply a bloody, vulgar mess. On par with the stupidity and excesses of Kevin Costner's (Smokers) Waterworld.

7231363,3,B00YQJRYGY,"There may be a single shot somewhere in David Leans 'Lawrence of Arabia' better than the one where Max first lays eyes on the lingerie ladies enjoying a happy ending with a firemans hose, but certainly not more than one.

Fury Road is at least a return to testosterone after the wimp-out of MM3 (not that it didn't have its moments all those years ago). Dir. Millers management of kinetic dissonance, both aural and visual, is masterful. Just when you think he is at 11 on his Marshall, he kicks it up even further in the third act.

The problem for me is the script, which is credited to three writers including Miller. It probably breaks down to one cocktail napkin each. I doubt they finished their first drinks and they were done. Imagine a brilliantly  staged two hour car chase with a few interludes for refueling. Kind of like NASCAR in a straight line. Most of us are apparently fine with that, given the high praise this film has received. But MM4 doesnt have a script. It has a shot list.

Me? I am sitting here nostalgic for the existential angst of The Road Warrior. There is more drama when Maxs dog dies in that movie than in this entire exercise.

And Max? Tom Hardy does not embarrass himself, notwithstanding that he spends at least the first half of the movie with a mask on his face. But he has very little to do until the third act, at which point it is pretty much too late.

The other issue is Charlize Therons character. She is butch and sullen in the beginning, and butch and sullen at the end.

Theres a scene where they have 4 high power shells left to take out a pursuing vehicle's spotlight, Max misses the first 3, then for the 4th Max surrenders the rifle and Theron uses Maxs shoulder to steady her shot (she only has one arm, Paul McCartney wants to date her).

Can you even imagine Mel Gibsons Max of The Road Warrior deferring to anyone, much less a one armed girl? Dissonance indeed. And all of that is fine except that Therons character (Furious-o or Focaccia or something like that) has no arc. Zero. She is flatter than the salt flats they drive through.

And finally, the war boys. Nux, who changes sides and helps Max and the ladies, is needed and beautifully played. But given the dust and sand and white face paint, I couldn't help but decide that the supporting cast were pretty much interchangeable with those yellow minions of movie stardom. Kevin and Stuart would have ruled in this movie.

Ill buy a round for anyone who can sit through The Minion Movie and MM4 in a theatre back to back and live. I don't think its possible.

Where does that leave us? I longed for many years for a 4th Mad Max movie, especially after the dud that was 3. Miller went off to do Lorenzos Oil and various other fine films. He was and remains a spectacular action director. But MM4 has no story. I won't repeat the  lame conceit that passes for one. Its been recited breathlessly by every critic. But in truth its a film school 101 McGuffin. Miller may not care, he blows stuff up better than anyone I can think of and probably had a great time doing it.

I hate to say this, but I will anyway. Im reminded of how Bertolucci completely lost his stones after 1900 and just wanted to shoot pretty girls and never made another great film. You know its true. Mad Max ended after The Road Warrior.

Do I blame Miller? Yes. Is that fair? Well, he is credited as Director, Co-Writer and Co-Producer. The buck has to stop somewhere.

Am I disappointed? Yes.

Is it my fault for expecting more? Yes.

Should you watch it? Yes, preferably in a good theatre. Then you can make up your own mind.

Note: if you have not seen Tom Hardy in Child 44, you have not seen his best work. Gruesome subject matter but a truly impressive performance.",1439942400,5,3754,4.4081041968162085

Don't get me wrong, I own Mad Max & The Road Warrior, and they are 2 of my favorite films, but Miller has come back to his own creation with a fury of his own.

I saw this in the theater and it was fantastic, but now watching it at home I love it even more. One thing that helps make this the movie of the year, the fantastic REAL stunt work done and the very limited digital effects. Even when you watch the credits you see how the digital effects team is small and listed last after every other person who had a physical job. Bravo Mr. Miller!

Of course skies are painted, of course the tornados aren't real, of course Furiosa's robotic arm is digital. The point is they use the right blend of real and digital here to keep you on the edge of your seat.

I love good FX but hate the way that over used digital effects takes away the excitement that watching a real person perform brings. Miller has given us more amazing vehicles, colorful and bold characters, and a fantastic story of Max finding his humanity that just make the previous films pale in comparison.

Some people think this is Furiosa's movie but not so, Max is the one on the journey to find himself from start to finish. Is he very talkative? No, but watch the Road Warrior and you'll notice Max does even less talking so that's just the way he is folks.

Watch this movie! Then watch it again with the subtitles on to catch all of the amazing sounds, chants, war cries and just fantastic character dialogue in the apocolyptic slang of Max's world.

""War Boys! War Boys! Kamakrazy War Boys! Fucacima Kamakrazy War Boys!""

Movies like this are rare, especially in this age of corporate star-making and formula driven dribble from Hollywood. George Miller had a completely free hand to make his vision come true on the screen, and that is also extremely rare in this era of film making.

It's a brilliant movie that is full of non-stop action. So, it didn't have a plot huh? Did we watch the same movie or what? There was a plot and a overarching theme. I plan to dismiss the view of people (sorry) who never watched the Mad Max series so don't know or understand the world. That's usually how it is when you have a hyped up sequel and a lot of people rush to see it and don't understand it and hate it. Also, if you don't know the world that George Miller created nor are you open to at least understanding it then don't waste your time. The movie is excellent. I recommend you start at the beginning with the 1979 movie Mad Max and work your way up to this one if you're interested in this world.

7231457,2,B00YQJRYGY,"It's like they put every completely ridiculous post-apocalypse cliche out of video games and comic books into a blender and made a movie from it.  The villains are all so over-the-top ridiculous in their grotesqueness and hatefulness that I can't even take them seriously.

I like it when a movie pays attention to all their notables, giving them a drive and a motivation and growth.  There was a lot of room for the villains to believe themselves to be the heroes of their own story, bringing survival and order to the wastes where before there was only death . . . but instead, they were just made despicable horrors going to war to retrieve their rape toys.

There was so much room for the rescue fodder to grow and harden into wasteland survivors, but through it all they were all mewling creatures distinguished mostly by their degree of cowardice.

There was so much room for a well-thought out heirarchy among the bad guys, with detail on why they live like rabid dogs, what motivates them to follow these . . . creatures . . . why they tolerate living in sub-human conditions.  But instead, they caved and played the villain card, making their leader a despot in a nepotic society, and his soldiers all interchangable religious fanatics yearning to die for a corrupted version of Valhalla. (The Viking afterlife.)  They mixed the worst of leadership, zealotry, and terrorism in a blender and hoped that we would fear it enough to overlook the lack of depth to it.

And why the HELL does a war party need an entire heavy vehicle dedicated to a bank of speakers, upon which a  guy plays an electric guitar that shoots fire?

Last but not least, I don't like their new take on Max.  In Road Warrior, he was one of the few sane people left in the wastes, despite the movie title.  This time, he's mad as a hatter straight from the start.

The only reason it earned a second star was because the action was well-chroeographed, well-considered, and well-filmed, but even that was kind of a rip-off of the road-warrior's driving battle.  The entire movie is basically that battle, stretched over two hours.  As awesome as that scene was, it's just not enough to make or break a movie alone.",1439769600,3,2191,4.625322997416021

This movie didn't deliver for me at all.  I didn't care about Max, Furiosa, the War Boy kid, the supermodels, nobody.  Didn't hate the dorks chasing them either because they were so obviously the triumvirate that 'killed"" the world: Big Ammo, Big Gas and Big Brother?....not even sure who the canyon motorcycle freaks were.  (The 4th horseman in this messed up analogy?)

Why they had a disfigured weirdo playing a guitar with a flamethrower on the front of a rolling amplifier is beyond me as well - maybe it's tactical genius that I just can't fathom.  I guess the message was supposed to be men are so dumb that this is their idea of the most awesome war wagon ever?

The whole thing reminded me of a nightmare family road trip...rush to get going, everyone's mad (get it?), things go wrong every step of the way....we get to WallyWorld ( I mean the Green Place) and it's closed (""The moose out front should've told ya...""), but instead of holding the guard at fake gunpoint and riding the rides....we go back home with a trophy dead guy on the hood, everyone's happy.

7231485,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Please don't be fooled by the hype surrounding this film. It is the most atrocious garbage I have seen in years and completely amateurish, heavy-handed, and over-the-top.

Charlize Theron's acting is absolutely awful, and the entire movie centers around her (and not, you know, Max, THE TITLE CHARACTER). It's a complete bait-and-switch.

Moreover, the entire plot consists of driving away from a compound into open desert, reaching a random point, THEN DRIVING BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED. The political message is the opposite of nuanced, the metaphors are a jumbled mess, and no one's behavior makes any sense, whatsoever.

If people actually like this movie, it has proven Mike Judge's Idiocracy to be prophetic.",1439683200,8,715,5.254385964912281

The cinematography was staggering. CGI was kept to a minimum (as far as I could detect) so the realism was totally smashing. The best stunt work I can remember, simply jaw-dropping. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron's portrayals were powerful and mesmerizing.

There was no story about how Max escaped the hordes, losing his family, taking vengence, etc.  The story was that some random women were trying to escape, and this random guy (Max) that you never learned about was trying to save them.  No real plot beginning or ending.  It started in the middle and just before the end of Mad Max (the original).

The characters shot a lot of things, but seemed a bit 2 dimensional.  Things were certainly strange in a post-apocalyptic world, but the strangeness didn't really mean anything... or maybe that nihilism is the point???

They had to much focus on the female roll she is not strong enough to carry a roll like this. It is hard to imagine that even with the explanation of her leadership and rise in rank, I find it hard to believe with the torcher of women being what they do then why follow a woman as a leader in the army.

What people don't realize is that Fury Road tells an incredible and compelling story through mostly visual storytelling and imagery. It brings depth to all of the characters as you learn of their tormented backgrounds and hardships which makes you care about them during the action scenes.

7231631,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Basically, I agree with the review that said: it was good and that was all.  It is good.

But, to add: it really isn't a movie about Mad Max, so that's something of a switch and bait.  And it does rather tread the moral high ground, which really made me think again about the original trilogy.  The first was shocking, but just okay as a film, the third, with the biggest budget was rather preachy (like this one).  It was really the second, Road Warrior (MM2), that was the best of the series.  It just had a perfect bend of minimal narrative, momentum and moral ambivalence that was so enthralling.  Was he good or bad, did he care?  Was he the problem, the salvation, the man or the state?  These weren't original themes (dollars trilogy, le samurai, boy and his dog, ashes and diamonds, etc.).  But they were just so well done in the second in the serires (RW).

If I was not expecting a MM film, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more.  The action is spectacular.",1439510400,3,973,4.344444444444444
7231632,5,B00YQJRYGY,"FINALLY! I've wanted to see this movie for what has seemed like forever. So often a film can be a victim of it's own hype and your own personal expectations, which are, more often than not, impossible to meet let alone ever surpass. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" does exactly that. Surpassing every expectation while at the same time exceeding some you never even knew you had. It is a masterpiece.

I use the word masterpiece precisely. There has never been a movie like this one in the history of cinema. Director George Miller deserves an Oscar for simply bringing this film to fruition. While, technically, he floods the screen with vibrant colors and unforgettable imagery, he has edited and paced this film to essentially be a non-stop barrage of intense, over the top action, absolutely chock full of detail and craft. The stunt work in this movie is like nothing I have ever seen before. Scene after scene, if they weren't so well shot and focused, would have made me stop and ask, ""how in the hell did they do that??"" There are scenes so full of metal, fire, dirt and flesh flying in so many different directions and impacting with each other with such ferocity, that I fully believe I will notice things upon repeat viewings I had never noticed before.

And view this film again and again I absolutely will. Even though it is such a visceral first watch that my hands are shaking as I write this. But, I won't come back just for the action. The characters that make up this frenzied future wasteland are every bit as compelling. Led by Charlize Theron as Furiosa and, oddly, supported in almost every way, by Tom Hardy as Max. People have raved about Ms. Theron's performance and rightly so. She is amazing in this movie and as this character. But make no mistake: there is a reason the movie is called ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". Tom Hardy's Max could have easily been overshadowed by Furiosa. He's not. The two are equals. Partners with much left unspoken but what is said and shared between them is at times emotional and always powerful. The supporting performances and sometimes just their faces are every bit as memorable.

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a fantastic film. Easily one of the greatest action movies of all time. But more importantly, this is one of my favorite films, period, of all time. Surreal. Sublime. Superb.",1439510400,3,2323,4.64720194647202
7231633,1,B00YQJRYGY,This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen! What a disappointment. Can we get a refund???,1439510400,4,101,4.1
7231634,5,B00YQJRYGY,"There are many films I failed to connect with emotionally over the past 15 years. After repeated bouts of disappointment with modern movies, I stopped going to the cinema. After all, what was the point? With few characters I could invest in, little sense of tension and urgency, and a general lack of excitement, I could stay home and watch wonderful television programs that actually entertained me.

That all changed this May. Although I had been awaiting this installment/reboot for decades, I was prepared for a ""Star Wars Episode 1"" sense of disappointment. Instead, ""Fury Road"" punched me in the face, strapped me to a nuclear missile, and launched me headfirst into the heart of the sun. I was absolutely STUNNED at how well this filmed worked. George Miller stuck with a relative simple tale, sparse in dialog, reminiscent of earlier films in this franchise. There is certainly much to say for the spectacle, with the carefully choreographed stunt work, the Queenslandish hyper-octane insanity, the taught pacing, the superlative soundtrack, and those vehicles -- metallic thundering beasts crashing and exploding through scene after adrenaline-pumping scene. By the same token, ""Fury Road"" is brimming with exquisite character detail, although this is hardly overt; this rewards repeat viewings. More subtly, I also see this film as a stunning homage to the art of film-making itself. From the silent era to matinee serials to gritty westerns to modern action movies, Miller draws upon a deep understanding and respect for the cinematic ""visual language"", which he blends in a most satisfying display. In some respects, ""Fury Road"" is an Aussified tribute to Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". The sandworms are replaced by War Rigs and Doof Wagons, but the terrain remains unforgiving, the resources are scarce and coveted, and great armies are built through exploitation of the innate religious tendencies of fervent warriors. But rather than emphasizing tedious political maneuvering and imbuing characters with super-normal abilities, Miller focuses on the desperate physicality of deeply human characters, which in effect, could be any one of us. This takes the story beyond the ""super-hero"" mythos, which is quite refreshing in context.

To summarize, ""Fury Road"" powerfully reminds us of how movies can and should be made. It's Bach through a wall of Marshall stacks-- all dialed to 11-- played by an orchestra of suicidal gearheads careening toward a cliff at supersonic speeds. It is an immensely satisfying warts-and-all return to form for a veteran director of the same generation as Motorhead and AC/DC. The movie is by no means perfect, but the glorious part is that you hardly care given an avalanche of spot-on scenes and characters. All action movies from this point forward should be measured relative to this film.",1439510400,2,2830,5.245033112582782

7231637,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie will put you on the edge of your seat till the very end, when the credits role. It is truly amazing and action packed. I love this movie and Tom Hardy makes this film. As Max he is a man of few words and all action and he waste no time taking care of business. This has to be one of Hardy's best performances ever. And let us not forget Charlize Theron her role as the Imperator Furiosa was simple amazing and make the movie what it is. This is an amazing movie, with great effects and wonderful acting. Worth watching again and again.",1439510400,,546,4.160377358490566
7231638,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie is on a whole other level of great. If someone said that a guy over 70 years old walks into a major movie studio after doing Babe and Happy Feet and tells them he wants to make another MadMax movie without a script after a 30 year gap, and he's going to shoot it in the desert in Namibia, I would have said never in a million years. Yet there it is, and thank God.

The best part of this movie is really everything. The fact you and Max both are just along for the ride makes the perspective and action that much better. The minimal use of CGI, the crazy creative vehicles they built and used, awesome acting, just every aspect is very, very entertaining.

What a wild ride.",1439510400,2,685,4.181818181818182
7231639,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Overall a really good movie! I me how it separated itself from the original and Max was more his own character in this one, not trying to imitate Mel Gibson. This actor was much better! I was also surprised to see my favorite recent up and coming actor in this, I didn't even know he starred in it either,Nicholas Hoult. He is a superb actor, I have looked everything he had done. He may not look it, but he is a definite leading role actor! And I don't need to say anything about Theron. She is one hell of a star actress, and always will be, she puts everything into her roles and it shows. This movie had a great cast! I highly recommend! Much better than original trilogy, especially considering how far special effects have come in the over thirty years since original.

The black & white (aka black & chrome) incarnation of Mad Max: Fury Roadwhich director George Miller considers the best versionis already streaming on Amazon as you read this. The theatrical release isn't until Nov. 1 and the Blu-ray box will come after that, so this is quite a surprise.

You must see it. It takes the already masterful film to places that make it a fresh and thrilling viewing experience, elevating the film in ways that actually surpass the color version. Like mono versions of records that sound more present than their stereo counterparts, MM:FR has an in-your-faceness that is searing in its detail and dimension. The geometry of space in MM:FR is a hyper-real b&w dream world that recalls Cocteau, Fritz Lang and Bergman. Can a black and white movie be psychedelic?

Well, it relents for a minute or two once or twice. So I'll add in something that I've only seen mentioned a few times:

* This film has a beautiful, ethereal quality. Its color palette is beautiful. It is literally beautiful to look at, beginning to end.
* The film's score is a triumph. The piece of music called ""Brothers in Arms"" that accompanies the motorcycle encounter in the canyon is a particular highlight.
* There is a silent movie quality about this film and yet it's literally exploding with sound and dynamic range.
* The film is shockingly devoid of any hint of product placement or advertising.
* The film is shockingly female friendly. Some would say feminist, but maybe I don't really know what that exactly means. But I do know the kind of violence against women that is the norm in action pictures is not here. The kind of wisecracking woman who can't possibly get by without the Male Hero is not here.
* The film lays bare what animals human beings really are; what this Civilization Is. This isn't a movie of what we _might_ become. It is a movie about what we _are_.",1439424000,,1250,4.482456140350878

Character development takes a slight back seat (pun intended) in this devastating ride of visually phenomenal proportions. The choreograph of the live action sequences are incredible even though much of it was aided with some special effects. It could use a little back story to the female lead role of Imperator Furiosa played by Charlize Theron and the main villain, but this movie is not really about giving a clear cut picture to all of its characters but is supposed to hijack your senses into a sequence of events in this post apocalyptic world and hope you survive like Max Rockatansky. I like how equal screen time is given to Furiosa the main heroine who shows to be a relentless bad-ass.

7231703,5,B00YQJRYGY,"It has been a very long time since an action movie has been so riveting, so exciting, so completely enthralling that it required a second viewing in theaters. But Mad Max is so unapologetic about it's approach and so ballsy, you have to watch it again to take in all that there is to see. We're talking hardcore stunts and what is essentially one long chase film filled with dudes flying from car to car, throwing explosive javelins at each other, and tearing through the road in souped up, highly imaginative vehicles of mayhem. This isn't just an action film, this is an exercise in adrenaline cinema. This is doing something that no one else has the guts to do in Hollywood. This is THE movie that George Miller had been waiting to make. But it isn't just the action that's solid. The cinematography is masterful at allowing it's audience to take everything in and we get some beautiful photography that makes even this apocalyptic hell of a world seem somewhat breathtaking, especially at night. The acting is very solid, with Tom Hardy taking over for Gibson and doing an admirable job. He gives Max the proper animalistic approach, a man who will do anything to survive, but is still the kind of hero we know him to be, just a bit on the mad side. Charlize Theron is pretty much Max's equal as Furiosa. She is the kind of tough, female action lead that cinema is sorely lacking and, not simply being female but also having a fake limb, she is pure badass. If they made a Furiosa film, I'd be one of the first in line to see it. Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to the franchise, this time as prime villain Immortan Joe, a somewhat sympathetic villain. The rest of the cast is great, with a stand out being Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of Immortan Joe's followers who is, at once, deeply motivated by attaining glory, but eventually finds his love overtaking his ambitions.

But beyond all this, Fury Road is essentially one long action film. There are a few breathers here and there, but once the film hits the road, it rarely slows down. And it is all very well done. Perfectly shot and executed, it is a visual feast with loads of creativity. If you're a fan of action cinema at all, this isn't simply a must watch, but a must own.",1439337600,3,2229,4.490147783251231

This is more of a rolling fight mixed with heavy metalish guitar opera. The plot is a little lacking as Max the character is in emotional range. He is more flat than anything.

All this being said it is greatly entertaining. The action surges at constant levels and breaks only to begin again. I always get upset when Hollywood remakes the classics but I honestly do not think they were trying to remake this one. They were aiming for a similar apocalyptic approach but past that it is a totally different movie. Great visuals is the key to this movie with action scenes.",1439337600,2,696,4.480314960629921

I will say Furiosa is the star of the movie. That doesn't bug me like so many other who gave this movie bad reviews. I thought she was a kick ass heroin.

This movie was s rush from start to finish with MINIMAL CGI! The majority of these stunts were real! Think about that when you watch it. There was a real guy on a real motorcycle jumping over the ""War Rig"" dropping a Molotov.

7231715,4,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a 2015 action film directed by George Miller. This film is the fourth installment in the ""Mad Max"" film series, which are also directed by Miller. To start this review, I must say that this is one of the best action movies in recent memory. ""Fury Road"" stars Tom Hardy as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, who replaces Mel Gibson from the original films. Max is living in a desolate, post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a cult leader who controls his followers with the last remaining water supply. Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a subordinate of Joe's, begins a mission to collect gasoline. However, Furiosa has secretly smuggled away Joe's Five Wives, women specially selected for breeding, in an attempt to liberate them from Joe's clutches. When Joe finds out, he sets out on the Fury Road with his War Boys in pursuit, with Max along for the ride. What follows is some of the best action sequences in film.

7231716,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This is one of those movies that makes you think which is why most people either love it or hate it.  George Miller doesn't hold your hand guiding you through the backstory and plot of this movie unlike most modern day flicks that feel the need to explain at lengths every single detail of what is going on in their movie in case you are too dumb to figure it out on your own.  There are deep implications which are implied throughout this film as to who killed the world, the goals of each town's leader, and why these women are so coveted.

First you have Immortan Joe who represents religion and commands the alliegence of War Boys, all who follow a cult founded by Joe that claims himself as a deity who can help these poor souls with their post-apocalyptic troubles cross the gates of Vahalla to the afterlife.  Then you have the People Eater who runs Gas Town and represents greed, constantly counts the cost of all actions made in this world.  People Eater also sees the true value of the women Joe is after since they are such a rare commodity.  Finally you have the Bullet Farmer who runs the Bullet Farm.  He represents violence and proclaims that he is the scales of justice, conductor of the choir of death.

So what exactly killed the world?  Religion which commands greed and violence.",1438819200,4,1299,4.493617021276596

I much anticipated this movie thinking it would fill in the time line between Mad Max 1 and mad Max 2. I was somewhat disappointed. I think the writers really missed the mark on the plot. It would of been so good that Immortan Joe , was the the toe cutter from first movie and survived the head on with the semi thereby getting the name Immortan Joe meaning Immortal. His son Erectus could of become Lord humungus in MadMax 2. Then the interceptor is destroyed in first 5 min of movie , i thought ok,  car is different , then its wrecked and rebuilt into some wild looking machine , i still hoped at the end of movie , it will be modified  to match what it looked like at beginning of Mad Max 2. But no they destroy it again near end of movie. The interceptor is just as an important character as Max is.  I am such a fan ,i have Lord Humungus gun case as seen in picture ,with my model 29 magnum.

7231720,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is stunning to put it mildly. The reboot is  a fresh take on the former film and thirty years after the last one this one takes us on a road trip that is visually and technically mindblowing. George Miller intended to create this  with Mel Gibson but it never worked out and then it was Heath Ledger and again that fell through.
So here is Tom Hardy in the iconic role that Mel Gibson made so memorable.
This is a perfect summer film that beats all summer movie. A film that was shot in sequence, is a long continuous chase through the waste land in Namibia but there is a story and there are also characters who are well developed.

The world has turned into a wasteland. In this world, water is a precious commodity. Max Rockatansky ( Tom Hardy) has lost his family  and joins the Imperator Furiosa ( Charlize Theron) in a war against an evil warlord. They steal his five wives and travel through the  barren land to deliver them to a oasis.  Surely, the warlord begins chasing Max and Furiosa and bring back the women.
What makes the film so watchable is it the visuals or the story? There is no clear answer, but I will go with both. The Namibian desert, the sets and the costumes all contribute to an terrific looking film. Dont miss this and if possible watch it on the biggest possible screen. I regret not watching it on the IMAX screen cause I didn't want to spend  a lot  of dollars. After watching the film I wish I had....",1438560000,,1453,4.3161764705882355

7231724,1,B00YQJRYGY,"It's pretty obvious after watching this new Mad Max film, that it isn't really a Mad Max film at all. This film is somewhat of a kick in the balls to Max fans and the character himself. In fact, it seems like George Miller has sacrifice the iconic 80's hero that he created and Mel Gibson brought to life to the feminist movement that's currently on the roll in the U.S. and Hollywood. Why would he do that? My first guess would be money. It's no secret that Miller had been trying to get his latest ""Max"" film going for years. A good chunk of the problem was financial as it is with every film that isn't 100% produced by the major studios. After years of trying get the finances together, a group probably came along that had a feminist agenda and agree to the amount he needed but only if he played by their rules and made major adjustments to the story. Most of those adjustments was turning the Max character into the ""second banana"" and having the story dominated by a female Max, which is what Furiosa is.....a female Mad Max. She calls the shots, she barks the orders she's leading them to freedom and Max is her Gyro pilot. Oh there are a few scenes where Max takes his balls out of Furiosa's purse for a few seconds but trust me, it's like a dog being let off his leash knowing, in a very short time, he will be leashed again. Even the posters and the Blu Ray covers reveal the true intent of the film. Max's face in the background, muzzled, while Furiosa face is front and center. How many films do you see with the supposed main titled character as  background fodder in the promo material.....Doesn't happen folks.
Of course, why Miller would do this is all speculation on my part, but I really can't see any other reason why someone would throw their own created character under the bus other then for a s*** load of cash. Whatever the reason, it's obvious he did it and he did it by using the o'l slight of hand trick. In one hand he created so much action and chaos in the movie that your attention was drawn to that. The whole film is basically the end chase scene from The Road Warrior but pumped up 4x while in his other hand he cleverly spun the feminist story line while snipping his characters balls and dignity.......yes it's true Mad Max has been neutered and a sad day for a iconic action hero character indeed. I for one will not be seeing any of the sequels if they happened to get made. Seeing one of the greatest action character in movie history being neutered once was enough for me.

  Todays movies seem to lay out everything for you so that there is no guess work, no speculation and no misinterpretation of what is happing on film. They hammer the obvious until a four year old can follow the movie, and don't give credit to the viewers that they can figure it out what is going on by themselves. I find this to be so boring.

7231729,3,B00YQJRYGY,"UPDATE:

The Fury Road Black & Chrome edition will be released as part of two sets in the US (in addition to the German release) this December. The first, an anthology called Mad Max The High Octane Collection (ASIN  B01LTHM35M ) and the second, Mad Max Two Film Collection (ASIN  B01LTHM352 ) which contains the first wave Mad Max: Fury Road Blu-ray version (in color) as well as the Black & Chrome Edition (the black and white version most of us have been waiting for). As of now, they are reporting one Blu-ray for both films together and one DVD for both films together with no official word as to whether the isolated score (which is how you get the silent version) will be present on the color version, the Black & Chrome version, or both, or (dread) neither and there is also no word confirming that the Black & Chrome has the dialogue/theatrical audio option. I will update when these issues have been addressed.

Original Review:

To repeat, this 3 star review is a review of the Blu-ray, not the film, which is brilliant in case you haven't seen it.

The distributor of this film has decided to hold back two separate versions of Fury Road, promised by director Miller, to be included here and confirmed by him as having been completed in time for this release, because they want more of our money. The plan is to hold back these versions, including the increasingly popular Black and White version, which is spectacular, for inclusion on a later release of this film. The second or third edition of this film will be one of Warner's ever expanding line-up of complete releases that only come out after the company has made endless money on an initial, pathetic offering with missing features and exclusions galore.

This film is glorious, make no mistake, but this release is shameful. If you love Fury Road and can't wait to see it again, I don't blame you for having to run out and buy it, but, if you can make yourself wait for it, I advise that you do so. Within a year they'll be talking about the full release (that this should have been) and you'll be able to purchase Fury Road with all the special features and alternate versions you were meant to have on this incomplete edition, though it is possible they'll hold that version until closer to the release of the first sequel to this reboot series. (Basically, think of this as another X-Men Days Of Future Past, if that had been a good movie with a second version actually worth seeing, and the alternate versions are like the Rogue Cut, if the Rogue Cut hadn't been a joke and you'll get the picture on this double dipping scheme they've got going over at Warner.)

Good luck in making your choice. I've decided to wait for the full release and, if there is any delay, grab a cheap copy of this in a Walmart bargain bin.",1437696000,"1,357",2793,4.516831683168316

7231731,5,B00YQJRYGY,"A brutal, honest, and gorgeously-filmed action movie with cool characters, a creepy villain, a stunningly ferocious Charlize Theron, and a Mad Max boiling over with quiet intensity. If you're just looking for something that has a lot of explosions, this'll get the job done. It's fast-paced and violent and other than the dust storm, there's very little CGI, so the action sequences look real and bloody.

But there's also a really interesting second level working here, because the movie isn't shy about gender commentary, particularly in the way the villain's view of women is contrasted with Max's. The film is also making a point about the way the fabric of society changes for the better when women shift from being sexual objects to equals.

The movie does a great job of developing the women into real people with believable reactions to the horrors they've been through, but the best thing about this movie is the way Max is completely un-threatened by having strong women at his side. He's not diminished by sharing the screen with Furiosa, and he's smart enough and confident enough to utilize her strengths when she's better suited for a task. There's none of that testosterone-drenched defensiveness that you find in movies like the Expendables or Fast and Furious, where the heroes seem sort of desperate to prove how manly they are, which apparently means cars and guns and girls in bikinis and constant power struggles over who's the toughest.

Max doesn't have to prove anything. He's gonna blow some stuff up, ruin the bad guy's day, and go about his business. What's more, he'll do it while treating every one of his fellow warriors--virtually all of them female--like equals the whole time. And as a woman, I have to admit, it's the most attractive and impressive portrayal of masculinity I've seen on the big screen in a very long time.",1437696000,10,1856,4.904458598726115
7231732,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Im not sure if I just watched a revved-up piece of performance art, or a Shakespearian monster truck rally, but it was fun while it lasted.

Theres little set up and an assumption that you know this heroic loner Max, surviving in the apocalyptic desert wasteland, haunted by the ghosts of the lives he failed to save.  Tom Hardy proves a worthy successor to Mel Gibsons original iconic early 80s role, though there isn't much mad in Hardy, just stoic survival with the weakness of caring for underdogs.  Max is taken hostage by a well-organized tribe of ravagers from a desert stronghold, where hes forced to serve as a blood donor for sickened warriors.  The fortress is home to Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne of the original Mad Max), a ruthless and aging warrior who wields control of machinery, gasoline, food, and water, and metes out just enough of it to the poor and desperate people to maintain control.  He also keeps a harem of 5 wives and a human milk farm in his rocky citadel, along with some we assume to be his inbred family members.  Hes protected by an army of willfully brainwashed warriors who believe they will feast in Valhalla for sacrificing themselves in war.  Unfortunately, we don't get to spend nearly enough time in this fascinating citadel and its hierarchy of denizens; theres some racin and chasin to get to.  Director George Miller (of the original 3 Mad Max movies and the wonderful Babe) wastes little time.

Joes prized driver, tasked with making raiding runs to secure gasoline in the nearby refinery, is Imperator Furiosa (a shaved-down Charlize Theron, stripped of femininity and granted truckdriver union status forever).  Shes been planning an escape to her far off homeland (the green place of many mothers), and is taking Joes enslaved wives with her.  Rig outfitted for maximum protection and carnage, she makes her run, and Joe sets out with his minions to bring her back.  From here, character development, plot and context all take the back seat (like, the furthest back seat) so that the real show can start; tricked out cars with crazed drivers performing insane stunts for maximum vehicular carnage, feats that Fury Road delivers in spades.  We get to see a ridiculously fun mashup of a monster truck rally, Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, and lots of flying auto parts.  Oh, and a winsomely beautiful quartet of Victorias Secret angels.

Miller tries to achieve a minimal yin/yang element in Fury Road, putting the bravery and feats of Furiosa and Max on equal footing and giving the beautiful cargo some tough moments of action.  Theron in particular is up to the task, and we could easily imagine her taking the role of Mad Max on herself (or perhaps theyll give her a new series, Fast and Furiosa).  She and Max develop a pretty quick trust (which I suppose is a must if you are commonly chased by fire-spewing maniacs) that consists mainly of nods and glances. Theres even a motorcycle-riding gang of survivalist grannies that show the road warriors a thing or two.  But this is a pedal-to-the-metal action flick, complete with live Heavy Metal music.  A highly amusing bit involves Joes raiding party, which sports a vehicle that houses a 3-story stack of amps, six massive Taiko drummers, and a shirtless guitar shredder cranking out a wicked metal jam.  Immortan Joe brings his own soundtrack with him.  THAT was fun to see, and I want them to have their own movie, please.  At least send them out on a promotional tour.

The ending, of course, leaves room for a franchise to emerge as Max slips back into loner mode as we all knew he would.  But its Furiosa we want to see more of.

7231735,5,B00YQJRYGY,"We waited 30 damn years for this sequel, God it was worth it. These films aren't big on story or character development, but I think it's more the idea of the series. You have to get lost in these films like the other characters are. You'll understand why they have do the things they do in this terrible, post-apocalyptic world, and have a good time while you're at it.

That being said, Mad Max: Fury Road is just as absurd, bizarre, unique, and... well... mad. Tom Hardy gives a funny and great performance as Max, he's a great addition to the series and a good replacement for Mel Gibson(who had a quick cameo). Charlize Theron is also cool, but I think Nicholas Hoult was far more interesting. He absolutely disappeared under the white makeup and surprised me of how much effort he was putting into this performance.
I love seeing George Miller expand on his universe and really show us just how screwy the future could be if society truly would fall apart.
The bigger budget makes this movie look and sound amazing, and somehow, it still contains the same feel as the first two Mad Max films(""Beyond Thunderdome"" kinda got bland).",1437523200,,1135,4.618811881188119

MAD MAX FURY ROAD: Max tries to help save the women, but finds out they are doing a perfectly good job of saving themselves, and maybe the rest of civilization as well. George Miller's action direction is as relentless as ever, with gutsier, riskier devices, most of which add up to making Max take a back seat to a phenomenal female hero. Some might say this film is too over-the-top to keep us interested in story and character. Others have said it's the best of the Max films. I don't hold with either view. ROAD WARRIOR is still far and a way the best Max film--but unlike the goofy and derivative THUNDERDOME, FURY ROAD is a worthy successor and (let's hope) points the series in a new direction.",1437523200,,857,4.535483870967742
7231737,1,B00YQJRYGY,I found it to be Terrible!!! Bring Back Mel Gibson and trash can most of the Computer Generated Effects which negates the need for any ACTING!,1437436800,6,142,4.5
7231738,5,B00YQJRYGY,"What a lovely day. Chortles the enthusiastic warboy Nux as he and the rest of the frenzied war party set out across a blasted landscape in pursuit of the Imperator Furiosa who just took an odd detour to Gastown. Furiosa, face painted with black grease and driving a mighty war rig. Seems as if she's absconded with the big boss Immortan Joe's property. Namely, five of his brides, his prized breeders. You warboys, pray for Valhalla! Spray on with righteous vigor that silver chrome! And charge your brothers as witnesses to your bravery! Y'all are about to get smoked.

No one figured on interference from their walking blood bank, him what's been trussed up and taken along for the ride. Crazy Max, with his pertinents tattooed on his back. Namely, that he's a universal donor with his O neg blood type. Once again, it's Max done caught up in other people's bu11shit.

George Miller bided his time. He's chilled for the past three decades and scoped out the competition and probably passed judgment on a crap ton of awful action flicks. He's back, now, to show y'all how it's done, son. Mad Max: Fury Road is a bombastic, white knuckled foray, the action so intense and unrelenting that the theater audience with me didn't howl or clap their hands as much as take a deep, deep breath whenever a lull presented itself. This may be the best picture I'd seen all year, and it's not because of the dialogue because there's a minimum of it, and not because of the plot because Miller only ever gives us a bare bones plot to gnaw on. It's astounding, then, that the motivations of each character are made so very clear, despite the lack of exposition. Hardy and Theron are the marquee performers, and they are riveting, but let's not front: it's all about the old man. Fury Road is a celebration of the George Miller aesthetic. His post-apocalyptic vision is much imitated, never duplicated. I was friggin' stoked when I first heard Miller was back on the helm, and dude does not disappoint. Listen, it'd be doing the film (and you) a collosal disservice to watch it on the small screen. I'm putting this out there: Fury Road may be the best action movie of the past decade - it's this or the Raid movies. Miller opens his sack of panache and orchestrates a brutal symphony of bodies in desperate motion. He captures the chaos and immediacy of the action sequences and frames them in a backdrop of vivid colors and inventive dystopian imagery that bitch slaps you on a visceral level. Miller, champion of practical effects, reminds us that there's no substituting for the souped-up, battered-down vehicles that are physically there getting jacked up to sh--. The screen exudes a palpable realness. And, oh, that rumbling score, jack.

There's a world-weariness to Tom Hardy that fits so well on Max. It's a toxic world that doesn't have a lot of good people left in it. Compassion is at a premium. Even Max was all about looking out for himself, until circumstances dictated otherwise. Quoting him: ""If you can't fix what's broken, you'll go insane."" I love, love, love the interactions between Max and Furiosa, and Max's unspoken understanding that Furiosa was his equal in combat. I ate up those moments in which they instinctively teamed up and then acted like it's no big deal. I'll even posit that Fury Road is more Furiosa's movie than Max's. Again, it's another case where Max got caught up in other people's business. Max, much like Dennis Colt, often times serves as a plot device to further along other characters' arcs.

In Fury Road, the women represent! We all suspected Furiosa was gonna be badass. One fear is that Charlize Theron is so widely recognized as a good actress that the audience ends up taking what she does here for granted. Theron is phenomenal and right away elevates her rogue Imperator to the same tier as Ellen Ripley and Sara Connor. But it's not just her. This movie is chock full of tough, tough women. Even the brides - and the assumption is that they'll just cower like typical damsels in distress - each of them steps up in key moments.

There are at least three strong characters, the most surprising of which is the warboy Nux, him what's enveloped in a sort of religious fervor. Nicholas Hoult as Nux is a standout and has the biggest story arc.

Hugh Keays-Byrne is the big bad Immortan Joe. This matters even more to Mad Max geeks because Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in Mad Max back in 1979.

7231742,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I grew up watching Mad Max, Road Warrior, and Beyond ThundeDome. With that being said, here is my review. When I first learned Mel wasn't going to play Max I said pass. Call me a fanboy, closed minded, or whatever. Mel to me is Mad Max, period. Anyways, I had nothing better to do so I figured I would give it a go. The movie itself packs a lot of really good action, and I was never bored at any moment. I believe the movie is worth watching once but will never be a classic like the first 3 films. I personally don't understand why they didn't make the movie a stand alone title and drop Max out of the title. I guess because they wanted to bank on the name of the series. The movie would have been just fine without Tom or anyone playing Max. The movie is great all by itself and really could have beat the negative feedback from the fans otherwise. Side note: did anyone notice Toecutter returned as the villian again?! I got a kick out of that. Crazy. Check the Pros and Cons Below.

Pros
+Lots of action
+Great female lead
+Little CGI
+Great storyline
+Decent film length

Cons

7231743,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Having been somewhat aware that a few other Mad Max movies had been made sometime in the 80's, I had no real point of reference when I went in to see this movie the first time.  I missed the first few minutes so didn't see how Max was pursued and apprehended.  There was however no time to contemplate that because from the first moment I sat down I knew I was watching something special.  There have been many reviews written that essentially recap the plot so I won't bother with that.  The reason why I would rate this movie as easily being one the best film of the year (and not just in the action category) is the monumental achievement that it is in every way shape and form.  It is like a Beethoven symphony that has four separate parts that take you through a journey and at the end leave you with the knowledge that you have just experienced something special.  I have now seen this film three times and just as I had suspected, I saw something new every time that confirmed my initial assessment of it.  Just like any master piece, it is not for everybody which I think is great thing.  But for those who really appreciate greatness that comes about only once in a long while (Like a great boxing match, think of Ali-Frasier, Hagler-Hearns, I could go on and on but you get the point) this movie is that rare gem.

I remember halfway through the movie, I thought to myself....""I don't know if I can handle any more awesomeness, I might have a heart attack and die right here in my seat.""

I love the original Mad Max films, especially 2. You may think.. ""Isn't this the same exact thing as Road Warrior?"" Yes and no.

It's like George Miller took Mad Max 2, buried it under 500 million dollars, lit it on fire, and threw it into a volcano that was flown into another dimension where all hype is delivered upon and your dreams come true (and then punch you in the face and laugh).

It is undoubtedly one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The set pieces in this are just INSANE. People knock the acting, the script, the plot like all their preconceived notions of film have to fit that cookie cutter formula for every film and THEY DO NOT.

I enjoyed thoroughly that Hardy said little and I felt all his expressions and small mannerisms spoke volumes. It didn't bother me that Charlize Theron played a large part in the film, she did a great job and made the movie that much better.

Is the movie one big chase scene? Yes. Is that bad? NO. It's AWESOME.

It really is amazing. The movie looks awesome, it's an incredibly fun joy ride and it keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire movie. It's crazy, it's weird, it's ludicrous and explosive, it's everything you could possibly ask for if you're asking for a post-apocalyptic vehicular warfare based action movie.

No it doesn't have the script of some pretentious Oscar movie. No it doesn't have the amount of dialogue as your daytime soap opera. What does that matter? Learn to push your boundaries and enjoy different things!

Being the first entry in thirty years (since Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome made in 1985), Mad Max: Fury Road features ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), who aids Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and five women in their quest for freedom. Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played Toecutter in the first Mad Max movie, plays the main villain Immortan Joe, who rules the post-apocalyptic community surrounded by the desert.

What is the most impressive part of the new installment is the action sequences, and you will get lots of them. Shot in Namibia, Fury Road offers a unique combination of exotic location and exhilarating car chase. It is like veteran director George Miller, who helmed the previous three entries, is trying to visualize all the wildest ideas for action he thought of during the last thirty years.

Unfortunately, entertaining as it is, the latest Mad Max film is no groundbreaker, lacking interesting characters. Where is the Gyro Captain? Or the Humungus for that matter? The film really needs someone like Vernon Wells and his inimitable character Wez.

Loud and fast-paced, Mad Max: Fury Road is a typical case of Hollywood rebooting an old franchise.

A gorgeous ballet of kinetic action and violence all the while grounded in very human emotions.  George Miller has managed to keep the movie simultaneously on a small scale but while addressing the big concepts of survival, courage, and redemption.  Great acting (all the more remarkable since the dialogue can fit on a couple of pages), great music perfectly suited to the action and stunning directing.  As other have said, a director at the height of his powers.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie as well crafted.  This was the work of dedicated group of artists- and it shows in every scene.  George Miller refined and tweaked it to perfection- a movie that hits no false notes.  And by maintaining the R rating he made an uncompromising and gritty adult action movie.
The movie starts off intense when within moments we are thrown headlong into the story.  No wasted scenes or dialogue.  The movie really kick into even higher gear when Furiosa starts her escape barely 15 minutes into the movie.  Every scene that follows are among the most memorable in movie history.  I don't want to restate the movie but two highlights that made me realize just what an accomplishment this movie really was.  The first is the hand to hand fight scene between Furiosa and Max.  A few minutes later is stunning scene with the motorcycle grenadiers in the canyon, which probably is one of the most stirring and greatest scenes ever done.  This scene is perfect on all levels- the stunt choreography, the photography and editing (in which some scenes are accelerated and some slowed down),  the pacing and acting (yes- acting- the desperation of the characters is tangible) and a perfectly matched driving musical score at once exciting (with heavy drums) that suddenly introduces violins which introduces an added layer of emotion.

There was no method to the madness in the move and I felt most the acting was far from good. Max was a pathetic character and at many points in the movie I was routing for his death. Some of it was so over the top I felt it was a travesty to even associate it with the Mad Max movies.  From him constantly seeing dead faces to his less than stellar dialog which was mostly grunting.  They should have just made this a solo movie, but then the ticket sales would have suffered since the only reason people went to this film was its faint connection to Mad Max. This is definitely one of the worst movie plots I have seen in a long time.  The whole concept of mothers milk and the truck full driving around made no sense. Wasn't tattooing every inch of everyones back with rules and branding their neck a little much?  What was the whole concept of human blood bags anyways?  Add in the most accurate shooter in the whole movie seemed to be a blind man shooting two uzis in the middle on a electric sandstorm containing tornados.

A nuclear war has made the world into a desert wasteland and society has collapsed. Immortan Joe rules from his Citadel, keeping the water from the common people and giving it out just enough to keep them complacent. He has an army of War Boys who never reach adulthood and gladly give their lives to fight for him. Max, a crazed man tortured by his past, is captured and used as a blood bag for an injured War Boy named Nux. Imperator Furiosa is supposed to be going to collect gas for Immorten Joe, but instead she takes his five wives and makes a break for the legendary Green Place. Determined to achieve glory, Nux straps Max to the front of his car and tears off after Furiosa, but things don't go as planned. Max and Furiosa reluctantly team up to defeat Immortan Joe, save the wives, and escape to the legendary Green Place.

Going in, I assumed Mad Max: Fury Road would be a typical testosterone fueled, misogynistic action movie. I had heard nothing but good things about it from everyone, so I decided to give it a chance and it didn't disappoint. The world building and aesthetics are amazing. The world is a barren desert due to nuclear war and aging Immorten Joe holds on to his power with an iron fist. He takes all the natural resources and commodities from random the public to hold over them and divvy out as he wants. This keeps the people poor and prevents them from overthrowing him. The most fascinating part of this bizarre world is the War Boys. They are strong and healthy young boys taken from the public and raised to be brainwashed, blindly faithful followers of Joe. As they get older, these strong and healthy boys become sickly and lose all sense of individuality. They gladly give their lives for their beloved leader and believe his promises of Valhalla after their death. None of them see maturity since they die from cancer or in the battles they fight. This whole regime is sick and unnatural because ancient Immortan Joe sacrifices the youth of his society in order to destroy the natural order of youth eventually taking power over the old. The young men are completely disposable and accept this state while the women are reduced to breeders and breastmilk machines. The film employs a style similar to steampunk, but more updated and mixed with a primitive, tribal vibe. Nothing in the film is new, but is instead repurposed from trash and stolen goods. Metal and technology in the film represent decay, stagnation, and enslavement rather than advancement or progress.

My favorite part of the film was the use of gender equality throughout from the portrayal of the female characters to how other characters treated them. Furiosa is the only woman with any sort of power in this world. Her crew defers to her even if they don't understand what she does. She has proven herself to them and they (mistakenly) trust her completely. While Max is the title character, he stumbles upon the main events by accident and isn't really the main focus of the film. Furiosa is the driving force behind it and I related more to her. Once they join forces, Max treats Furiosa as an equal. He accepts that she is better at him at some things, like driving the massive rig, shooting a giant gun he repeatedly missed with, and continually following her lead. They help each other and recognize each others' strengths and weaknesses. Their relationship is a partnership and a friendship. Furiosa is a nuanced character who is tough as nails and extremely capable, but still has emotions. She seeks to improve her life, exact revenge, and save others. Charlize Theron captures both sides of the character and just blew me away. The emotions in the film run strong despite all the explosions and violence, resulting in some beautiful, quiet scenes between characters. In the end, it's Furiosa who kills Immortan Joe, overthrowing his regime, and takes the responsibility of rebuilding that society while Max continues on his own journey.

One of the reasons I thought I would hate this movie was the portrayal of Immortan Joe's wives. I saw an early preview of the first scene with Max and Furiosa. The wives wear diaphanous, sexy silks which are incredibly impractical for the desert setting. I figured they would be repeatedly raped on screen, nude at inappropriate moments, and generally useless to the story. I am so glad to be wrong. The misogynistic treatment of women in the film stems from Immortan Joe's regime. He reduces women to unwilling breeders and milk providers while Furiosa and Max eventually free all these women in their upheaval. So many people mistake the inclusion of misogyny in a film as an affirmation of it, but they need to look at its context within the film instead of jumping to conclusions. The wives' dresses are meant to titillate and look pretty, but they've chosen to free themselves from this view. Their past sexual abuse is never shown in the film because it doesn't have to be. They don't have to prove to the audience that they were indeed essentially sex slaves in a guilded cage for a megalomaniac. Some of the wives want to go back to their guilded cage because of a combination of Stockholm Syndrome and that their cage and its trappings are familiar in contrast to their uncertain fate in the desert. The wives, while not physically tough, did all they could to help Furiosa and Max through physically blocking them with pregnant bellies, deceiving the enemy, reloading guns, etc.

I enjoyed Mad Max: Fury Road. The characters are complex; the visuals are brutal and beautiful; the story is surprising; the themes are relevant; and the inclusion of music in a dystopian society is spot on. Why would future societies reject art? The guy with the flamethrower guitar was my favorite minor character. The movie is just a breath of fresh air all around. I highly recommend it.",1435449600,9,5854,4.740922473012757

7231771,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max is back with a bang.  The latest George Miller film follows the tradition of his earlier manic action films following the life and times of an outcast group of dysfunctional survivors from a post-nuclear war,  global apocalypse.

Lets be honest, no one goes to a Mad Max film for the careful character development and the nuanced screenplay.  In fact, Mad Max (Tom Hardy),  is almost irrelevant in this film; for most of the time his identity is hidden behind a small inverted garden hand-fork, forcibly strapped to his face, as a marker of his ownership by others.  Even his blood is literally being stolen by his enemies.
For a more dynamic and less psychotically broken human interest we turn to the left arm amputee Furiosa (Charlize Theron).  She is still active in her world and is seeking signs of ecological survival and redemption, in this blasted landscape of  utter alienation (the Namibian desert). Max merely hopes for escape and freedom.

Theron carries what little plot there is, and she does this well.  But Miller thinks visually and this film is an auditory and visual feast.  Director/writer Miller pays a little knowing homage to the westerns of John Ford at the beginning of the film by choosing a section of the Monument Valley skyline as a place to begin. Ford,  like Miller, thought in visual terms.  Plot and screenplay were usually subsidiary to sketched story-boards.  In this case the story-boards preceded the script by many months.
 Many viewers will regard this film as excessively sadistic, voyeuristic, perverted and without structure.  It exploits images of deformity, amputation, sexual control,  illness and  injury.  It celebrates casual nihilistic cruelty and destruction.  It worships revenge.  The usual MM mix, then.

The plot is silly, circular and repetitive.  What makes this film so visceral and so spectacular is the sheer effort and energy put into the splendid cinematography and  sound-track.
Usually a review emphasises acting and directorial skill.  Here we must acknowledge the extraordinary creativity of the artwork,  the costumes (Jenny Beavan), the weapon experts (Simon Bethune), the stunt drivers  (Western on Wheels) and the vehicle-chase co-ordinators (Lauren Wild)

The film is unapologetically loud and brash (a theme taken up by the audience in the cinema I visited).  The scenery and the sets are breath-taking, but above all, the trucks and combat vehicles are superb.  Bosch would have loved them.",1435363200,3,2471,5.166666666666667
7231772,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I am a massive fan of Mad Max and Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior so I tried to keep an open mind regarding such a long awaited sequel and Tom Hardy portraying Mad Max. Tom Hardy was not too bad to be honest (but it was impossible for him to better Mel Gibson) but the film was OK. There are one or two problems with this film. As much as great director George Miller is this film is, as we say in Great Britain, ""all mouth and no trousers"" in other words the sets and the vehicles are superb and the story promised so much yet over all it was such a let down. Tom Hardy not only played second fiddle (or should I write third fiddle?) to Charlize Theron (Imperator Furiosa) but I also feel that he was overwhelmed by Hugh Keays-Byrne (Immortan Joe). Mad Max also has very little impact on screen. To be honest it could hardly be called a Mad Max film. I do not go with the idea that it was a feminist film it is just that Mad Max should have had more to do. Maybe my opinion stems from seeing the first films first time around?",1435276800,8,1023,4.019607843137255

7231775,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max is thus far the film to beat this year. Yes, it's THAT balls to the walls good and must be witnessed in a theater where the high octane action can shatter your senses. George Miller handled the chaos like a maestro handling an orchestra of carnage. The contrast between what could be achieved in film 30 years ago and now has never been so evident. I hope filmmakers take note that if you want to reboot a franchise you better have something to say, and Miller shouted that sh*t from the rooftops like a damn banshee.

This film was firing on all cylinders the entire time. The story, while simple, has depth with how much is shown rather than told about the main characters. Don't listen to the naysayers about Max taking a back seat in the story, he has always been assisting others in his previous films. If you've ever actually watched the first three movies, after Max's family was killed in the first film he became a lone drifter and keeps getting caught up in other people's problems. Road Warrior and Thunderdome both involved him stumbling on other people with their own stories and struggles, and Max deciding to become the reluctant hero for their conflict. In Road Warrior all he wanted was a tank of gas from a camp, and ended up tipping the scales for an impending onslaught. He had around 19 lines in that whole film. Fury Road is no different. He doesn't take a back seat to Furiosa, they are equally reliant on one another throughout most of the film. Their character arc and bond grows very naturally, and it's clear they're stronger as a team rather than as individuals. Those who have a problem with how instrumental Furiosa's character and her conflict is in the film clearly aren't familiar with the franchise to begin with. The people and their conflicts Max becomes involved with in this film and his other previous movies are what helps him hold on to his humanity the longer he wanders the wasteland.

You can tell Miller thought out all of the details of this world from the ecosystem of Immortan Joe's citadel to the knee brace on Max's leg from a previous injury in the older film's 30 years ago. As far as the art and sound design go, Mad Max is Oscar worthy. Somehow they managed to turn a barren desert wasteland into a hauntingly beautiful landscape. There's so much variety in set design that you leave this movie thankful knowing how dull and uninspired the environment could have been without Miller's vision for it. Unlike other post apocalyptic films that often desaturate the color palette to add to the bleakness, Miller went the opposite route, and it makes the film's look so unique for the genre.

Watching the action sequences was like seeing an Olympian stick a perfect dive over and over again. Every scene was perfectly paced and punctuated with the fight choreography, camera work, and sound and music design. The film is surprisingly not as gory as many other movies nowadays while still feeling incredibly gritty and hard hitting. The musical score kept the adrenaline pumping throughout the entire film, coupled with the practical effects that put most CGI ridden summer blockbusters to shame. Fury Road should be an example for how action and effects should be handled today, with so many lazily defaulting to CGI.

Overall, this movie is every bit as incredible as you've heard. While I don't like to be reactionary, I can honestly say it will likely put all other action films this year to shame. It is indeed one of the best action films. Hell, it's one of the best films in general to come out in recent years. This movie was a labor of love. I hope this movie sets the example for other movies to follow suit not only in all around production quality, but how films should be made with passion and heart.",1435104000,8,3770,4.6307922272047835
7231776,4,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie is UNIQUE because it creates an  OVERWHELMING sense of Urgency, Desperation, Brutality, and Craziness.

The scene in the first five minutes where Max is chased by his captors looks so urgent that its breathtaking.  This feeling continues with other scenes till the end of the show.

The craziness is depicted so cleverly that it scares the wits out of me. For example, the scene where the guy tries to torch the car hes driving and jam it into his opponents as a fire bomb is so terrifying. While doing that, he says ""I live. I die. I live again!"". Its so close to reality. He and others are brainwashed and believe that if they die for Immortan Joe their souls will  be sent to heaven. In real life, there are thousands of people like that.

The brutality is over the top. For instance, the scene where the skin from the face of a bad guy is ripped off during a fight is very bloody.
The acting is interesting. Tom Hardy (Max) , Charlize Theron (Furiosa), Nicholas Hoult (Nux),
and  Hugh Keays-Byrne (immortan Joe) make their characters convincing. Hugh Keays-Byrne looks very intimidating and crazy. Nicholas Hoult acts like a brainwashed mad man when he first appears.

The directing is gripping. It makes me feel as if I were right in the middle of the action.

The yellow and orange colors of the desert add the hardness to the terror.

Of course this kind of movies defies logic. I have to put it to sleep to enjoy the film.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are its financial figures as of August 2, 2015:

Release Date:, May 15, 2015
Production budget: $150 million
Domestic grosses: $152,169,645
Foreign grosses: $216,000,000
Worldwide:  $368,169,645

So, it has taken in 218 million dollars more that its production cost. Thats a huge amount for an R-rated movie.

In short, its ONE of the MOST TERRIFYING movies Ive ever seen in the last two years.",1435104000,4,1879,4.651515151515151
7231777,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Whats it about?

Max escapes a post-apocalyptic cult and ends up unlikely allies with a group of fellow escapees. Explosions and car chases ensue.

What did I think?

Gloriously insane or insanely glorious? To be honest, its both. I am gobsmacked. In a quite simplistic plot, Miller has taken some huge risks but they have all paid off. Females who are strong characters in their own right. Over-the-top interpretations of religion and in-movie soundtrack guitars and drums. Very little dialogue. Any and all of these could have gone wrong, but its all part of an escalation of action and adrenaline that leaves you breathless. Its brutal, unrelenting and so much fun. Are there some problems? Yes. Do I care? No.

7231780,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Wow! All I can say is, wow. My breath was taken away when I watched this movie. The action is top-notch and there were a lot of throw-backs to Mad Max 2 and Thunderdome. These are not spoilers that would take away from any surprises for those that haven't seen the movie yet, but when they came up in Fury Road, I felt they were there as a kind of nod towards the previous movies:

1. Music box - remember this from MM2? Well, someone pulls up a music box just like Max had before he gave it to the Ferrel Kid. Not the same song (wasn't Happy Birthday) but still, I liked it.
2. Weapons - Remember when Max had to give up all his weapons in Thunderdome and it seemed like a never ending supply of weapons? Well, this time, Max has to pull them from Imperator Furiosa and I had to chuckle.

There were more little ""throw-ins"" that nod back to the previous movies, but in the end, the movie as a whole would have been the same with or without them.

What makes the movie so much better than the dreck that has been spilled out over the past 10+ years is, actual set pieces were used in all the stunts. Yeah, there's CGI, but only where it is needed/warranted/necessary. But, all the crashes, all the chase scenes were filmed live action. Many had CGI to implement backdrops, remove safety harnesses, etc. All these things were not possible during the filming of the first 3 MM movies (due to technology and budget). According to George Miller, Fury Road is how he envisioned MM long ago, but there was no way to pull it off in a believable fashion. Now, with today's technology, George was able to achieve what he envisioned over 30 years ago. And he didn't have to crash his van like he did in the first MM movie.

Max is more of a secondary character, but it's still like all the other MM movies: he's lost, he isn't necessarily looking for redemption, but in the end, he gets it. According to Miller, this takes place sometime after Road Warrior/MM2. At first, as you can see in the trailers, he has the V8 Interceptor which would have those who have watched MM2 confused. SPOILER FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T WATCHED MM2/ROAD WARRIOR:

As we know, the Interceptor was blown up, so how could he have it again? Well, doing some research, I found that apparently, some time before Fury Road, Max has gone on a ""walk about"" of sorts, searching for parts to rebuild his Interceptor after it's ""death"" in MM2. The only thing left is finding a V8 engine. There is a set of comics coming out that are prequels to Fury Road. One follows Imperator Furiosa, another Immortan Joe and then the third follows Max and in that third one, it details how he apparently rebuilds the Interceptor which we see in Fury Road.

</SPOILER>

Charlize Theron is excellent as Imperator Furiosa. Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe delivers another solid performance (after being the Toe Cutter in the original MM), but it is kind of a shame it wasn't a huge role. Nicholas Hoult as Nux is excellent and turns in a solid performance as one of the War Boys for Immortan Joe who is looking for redemption as well so he can make it to Valhalla, a sort of ""Heaven"" that Immortan Joe preaches about.

And then there's Tom Hardy filling the iconic role of Max that Mel Gibson made famous. I must say, I felt that he would do fine as Max. Mel is getting too old and all I can say is, after seeing Tom in The Dark Knight Rises and in Warrior, I felt he had the chops to do this. Unfortunately (or maybe some might feel fortunately), his role is limited. Max is definitely secondary in this movie to Furiosa, but it's not a bad thing. The limited dialog from Hardy is sort of a disappointment, but with the dialog he does have, he does excellent. This isn't anything like his role in Warrior, but he does justice to the Mad Max character. In no way did I ever feel during the movie that ""Mel would have done that better"". No, Tom Hardy as Max was an excellent choice and never did I feel slighted or cheated in the least with him taking over the role. Let's hope there are more MM movies with him taking an expanded role in it.

The action is furious and takes your breath away. For a two hour movie, you cannot go wrong with this one. There are breaks between the action that give you enough time to catch your breath, but then in vintage Miller fashion, he throws the frenetic action into over drive. George Miller must have used some serious Nitro for this movie, because it's high speed action that never lets up. And the story is excellent, as always.

The music itself is great. Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) has written a soundtrack that is befitting of a Mad Max movie. Better than Maurice Jarre in Beyond Thunderdome, and right there with Brian May who did the score for MM and MM2. I rarely purchase soundtracks, but I definitely will for this one. The music sets the tone, increases your heart rate through the chase scenes, and sets the tone during the ""quiet"" periods of the movie. Junkie XL did an excellent job composing the soundtrack for this movie. It kind of reminds me of The Dark Knight soundtrack. Orchestral instruments with guitars thrown in with a furious tempo and a percussion section that vibrates your heart and soul and enhances the viewing of this movie.

The chase scenes hearken back to the final chase scene in MM2 and, unlike the chase scene in Beyond Thunderdome, last much longer and are much more action packed and not toned-down like it was in BT. It's violent, it's furious, it's jam-packed to the hilt, overflowing with tension, excellent stunt-work and amazing effects that all work together to make Fury Road one furious ride that leaves you breathless and amazed all at the same time. There is humor there too that helps relieve the tension, but it just seems like a never-ending action set-piece after another, and that's not a bad thing.

If you have not seen this movie in the theaters, do so now. Do not wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray (although I will be getting it to add to my MM collection) as this must be experienced on the big screen. I didn't see it in 3D, but the 2D viewing was excellent none-the-less. It will have you on the edge of your seat through the entire 2 hours and when it's done, you'll be relieved, but you'll also want more. And that's never a bad thing with Mad Max.",1434931200,14,6298,4.410499139414802
7231781,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is not a continuation of the franchise. It's an uncredited reboot, directed by the series creator himself. Of all the movie characters that George Miller could have successfully resurrected at this point in his career (his two best films of the last 20 years being ""Babe"" & ""Happy Feet""), Max Rockatansky is by far the most unlikely. Max Max: Fury Road opened in theaters, and to the total surprise of fans everywhere, it received almost universal critical praise. There are fewno, scratch thatno other action movies that are rated as high as Fury Road. The movie itself is not exactly a film, it's an amusement park ride, on the same level as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and 300. Fury Road demands to be seen in theaters, in 3D, on the biggest screen your city provides.

Packed into a 120 minutes runtime is a sprawling, nonstop car chase that roars through endless desert wastes, a vicious sandstorm, and wave after wave of explosions. Tom Hardy barely speaks any lines of dialogue as Max. Charlize Theron on the other hand, brings new life to the series as Imperator Furiosa, a tough-as-nails demolition car driver who is arguably more masculine than the grunting, burly Max. Furiosa's biomech arm helps cement this character's iconic appeal, in the same way as ""Ash"" Williams of Army of Darkness or Cherry Darling in Planet Terror. Her gritty prowess as a post-apocalyptic warrior gives away to childhood yearning once Furiosa is reunited with the clan of her youth. This interlude is the only time that Fury Road stops to catch its breath, so to speak.

Immortan Joe (Toecutter in the first Mad Max) does an excellent job as the tyrannical despot that runs the Fury Road destruction derby-like car race. Racing vehicles are slapped together in a very haphazard way: chassis of all kinds, from muscle cars to long haul cabs, are combined with monster truck wheels, tank tracks, and porcupine spikes in a sort of Franken-auto mashup.  The design aesthetics totally blow everything from Road Warrior out of the water. Their otherworldly appeal almost gives these cars an alien-like appearance. The characters' bizarre costumes, warpaint, and accompanying soundtrack meld together to form a post-apocalyptic armageddon that is governed by Valhalla, a reincarnating existence that pits humans against one another in brutal fights in which death merely resets the process.

Unique touches and insane attention to detail (I will not spoil it for those yet to see this movie) really sets Fury Road apart from many recent action flicks that make money at the box office but fail to arrouse critical applause. Neil Marshall's ""Doomsday"" being the most obvious comparison, which ironically enough, was totally ripped off from Road Warrior. The continuous looping drum roll and crazy guitar licks (both of which are played live on Immortan Joe's fleet), deserve an Oscar for 2015's Best Original Score category. Let's hope that this is only the first pairing of Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and George Miller in a Mad Max film!",1434844800,7,3032,4.998019801980198
7231782,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Don't listen to the negative critics. You watch a movie like this for the apocalyptic, base nature that we all imagine humanity will deteriorate into with the fall of a civilized structure. If you go into this movie looking for some type of rational and logical outworking that takes your understanding of these things to a new level, you will be disappointed. This movie simply does homage to the gritty nature of 'The Road Warrior' with the battle wagon chase combined with the idea of a new type of civilization and even trade that was built around 'Thunder Dome'. Throw in a few twisted and perverted megalomaniacs with a pagan religious slant in the viking style and you have all of the fuel needed to power the death engine in this end times thriller.
This movie starts and then never stops with the fast paced action and fantastic fight and chase scenes. If you are looking for a new twist on the old essence of the Road Warrior... you will find it in spades with Fury Road. Tom Hardy does a terrific job of taking off Max in this new rendition. The detached attitude with some semblance of conscience that keeps him desiring distance but always willing to lay his life in the line to help others is carried right through this plot as it was through all of the others.

7231785,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max:Fury Road is one of the rare gems that tells its story by its deeds, rather than its words. Hitchcock once said that a truly great movie can be seen and understood by the movie goer in any language, without subtitles. Fury Road is such a movie.

The world of Mad Max is detailed and immersive. There is no explanation or contrivances that explain who the characters are or what the world they live in is like. All is revealed in the characters actions as the story moves forward. This is no mindless action movie - the manner of storytelling here is actually masterful. Neither Max nor Furiosa's characters do a ton of talking. Instead, they convey amazing emotions just by their physical movements and facial expressions. Tom Hardy can convey more with an expression than lesser actors can with 100 words of dialogue. He is really an amazing actor who meets his match with Charlize Theron. The development of their characters is artfully advanced and revealed just by their actions.

There is a ton of amazing action in this movie that is complemented with some amazing acting. The stunts are also mostly live action. It was awesome to see real people in action rather than watching a CGI cartoon pretending to be a movie. A few critics write this movie off as just low brow summer action.

I cannot wait for it to come out on blu-ray so I can enjoy all of the special features I am sure are to come with it.",1434499200,4,610,4.008196721311475
7231788,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Let me start by saying that I was not excited to see this film, I thought the trailers looked fun but kinda weird, but I thought of it as nothing more than another throwaway action movie. Besides how could I be excited for this with Ultron coming out around the same time?

How wrong I was... the first time I saw it I was absolutely blown away, and I knew that I had just witnessed something special. By the time the movie was over all I wanted to do was see it again and when I did it became firmly entrenched in my top five favorite films of all time. The reason why that is a huge deal for me is because I am really indecisive when it come to that, I couldn't actually name the other films in my top five except for Star Wars and Lord of the Rings (take your pick on the installment). But now I have three set in stone.

It was such a pleasant surprise, how a film that I didn't even care about, not only turned out to be such great fun but also one of my absolute favorites! As of this writing I've seen it four times in the theater and plan on going at least once more.

I won't go into too much detail as I'm sure other reviews have that covered suffice to say that everything from the characters, to the acting, to the stunts, to the soundtrack were all amazing. I actually cared about the people involved and I didn't get or need and everything handed to me to understand the plot or why things were the way they were. Charlize Theron as Furiosa will go down as one of my favorite characters of all time, and Tom Hardy and Nick Hoult, as Max and Nux respectively were also fantastic! And that isn't even to mention the rest of the cast who were great as well.

I really cant think of enough good things to say so Ill just stop here because I am sure you'll get the idea. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did and I hope there is more Max in the future!",1434326400,9,1862,4.024324324324325
7231789,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This movie couldn't have come at a better time. I can't believe it exists. So unconventional. So insane. A lean plot, but loads of story. It shows you everything, but explains nothing. If you like or need exposition, sorry you're out of luck. You have to pay attention to what this film SHOWS you. Besides, exposition is for pussies. I'm so sick of comic book movies with two and a half bloated hours of over complicated story and plot and comic world tie-ins. There is story in every single frame of this movie. In every stitch of clothing. In the cab of every vehicle. On the face of every character. This movie is batshit crazy. I can't believe it was funded by a major hollywood studio.  It's what I always wanted. The craziest big budget movie ever made. Ive never seen anything quite like it. It's my favorite movie in years. If you didn't like it, I don't care. 2015 is officially over. Cheers George Miller. Witness!",1434326400,29,924,4.532934131736527
7231790,4,B00YQJRYGY,"The only Mad Max movie that I had previously seen was Beyond Thunderdome. Oddly enough, that was shown in a mythology class that I took during college, as the filmmakers reportedly looked to Joseph Campbells famous commentary on the heros journey in writing the script. When I first heard of Fury Road I wasn't sure if I wanted to go see it. However, that epic trailer featuring Giuseppe Verdis Requiem, a colossal sandstorm, and enough fire to please Beavis really hooked me. The extremely high score on Rotten Tomatoes, which was in the high nineties by its opening weekend, convinced me to go.

Commenting on the story is tricky. Its simplistic to the point that, in theory, it shouldnt be sustainable over two hours. Whats there, though, it extremely intelligently crafted. Youd hope that Tom Hardy would do well in taking over Mel Gibsons best-known early role and he certainly does. Charlize Theron also makes a great female lead.

In all truthfulness, commenting on the action is even trickier. The hard part is finding the best words to describe the vehicular combat along the roads and dunes of post-apocalyptic Australia. I can just say that it is truly high-octane, truly wild, truly visceral, truly hard-hitting, and truly bad-a**. I couldn't even pick a highlight if pressed. The highly dramatic cinematography and effects drive all these qualities home.

I understand that Tom Hardy signed up for an additional three Mad Max movies. Lets see what George Miller and his team cook up in the years ahead.",1434240000,2,1515,4.933333333333334
7231791,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Porn film formula:
Nonstop full nudity with raw unsimulated sex acts, tied together with little more than a few patches of duct tape, a half foot of baling wire and the producer's wad of old chewing gum for a story. Overload it with closeups of raw sex acts and the buyers of it won't see there's no plot (nor will they care). It sells DVDs by the rail car load.

Formula for many current Hollywood action films:
Use porn film formula. Substitute the raw sex with spectacular stunts, copious quantities of GFX and VFX, and cause permanent hearing loss inducing tinnitus with the SFX, all at a nonstop ADHD breakneck pace. Make it spectacular and loud enough with a fast enough pace and the audiences won't realize there's no plot with any substance. It sells tickets by the theater load and popcorn in 5 gallon buckets by the rail car load.

So now we have the latest Mad Max movie, ""Fury Road"", using the current Hollywood action film formula. It's little more than a two hour extended chase scene. There's just barely enough miniscule plot to launch and maintain the chase. Forget about story depth or character development. It's all about sensory numbing overload, including giving you permanent tinnitus. Take a good dose of Ritalin before watching and you might realize the emperor has no clothes. The original Mad Max had a real plot that provided background and character development that gave cause to care about the anti-hero. Its two sequels extended the original premise and further developed the Mad Max character. ""Fury Road"" does none of that. Why is it even called a ""Mad Max"" movie? The Max anti-hero has been reduced to supporting role, with the lead taken by a new character, ""Furiousa."" Should have been titled ""Furiousa: Fury Road"" which would be much more accurate. Oh, but wait, we won't be able to sell as many tickets as we could by invoking a past franchise's name recognition, so let's call it a ""Mad Max"" movie!

I'm going pull out the original trilogy Blu-rays and watch them. Perhaps the bad taste in my mouth from Fury Road will go away then. But I'll have to wait until the level of tinnitus from the painfully loud theater audio subsides so I can hear it. Gets 1 stars from me because it's not near the level of the absolute worst movie I've ever seen.",1434240000,11,2284,4.648514851485149

A reboot of The Road Warrior with hammy dialogue and an actor with no charisma playing the lead role, who happens to take a side seat in his own film. Stunts were great, but they went on for too long. There was no build up and no character development whatsoever. Why should we even care what happens to these people, yet alone our generic one dimensional hero? Hollywood needs to stop with all these remakes/reboots. Apparently Kindergarten Cop is getting a reboot too! Can't wait for that one.",1434240000,58,627,4.557522123893805

But the most important feature is the well-drawn characters that inhabit a world so meticulously crafted with visual details and storytelling. The worldbuilding is so interesting and thorough that you'll want to live in the movie's world for the rest of your life. Water wars and all!

I work at a movie theatre and every time I walk into an auditorium playing it or even just walk past the music, I smile. Not a lot of movies like that out there so 5 stars. That said, it's not a movie everyone will appreciate. It's violent and hectic and over-the-top, which is 100% why I love it. But that's not for everyone. Not a lot of dialogue which is perfect for me as the story is pretty straight forward and I want to concentrate on the movement. Some people want drama, realism, and old Mad Max. That isn't this movie at all. The trailer pretty much showed that. The Mad Max title doesn't describe the character, it lets you know you are in that universe. The stories doesn't have to be a straight continuation of what you already watched but you have the lore to start with so the world-building can take less time and you can get to the action.",1434067200,6,1005,4.212435233160622

 Banish any worries you might have about director George Miller tarnishing his legacy with this return to the iconic character he created more than 30 years ago.

7231802,5,B00YQJRYGY,"An artistic action film is not something Hollywood cranks out everyday, but Aussie director George Miller, who basically invented the post-apocalyptic, dystopian sci-fi genre with the previous Mad Max films has created just that with Mad Max: Fury Road. For all of its high-octane action, there is so much more lying underneath the surface. Albert Einstein one said ""There is brilliance in simplicity"" and on the surface this film may appear to just to be  2 hr. chase film with minimal plot and dialogue. However, that is the genius of this film. All of the those who complain ""there is no plot"" or ""no character development"" are clearly missing it. All the plot and character arcs are conveyed through the visuals, however if your someone who needs to be spoonfed information  through exposition then this will be lost to you. George Miller believes that film is a pure visual medium, and believes in ""show, don't tell"". Miller learned about cinema by watching silent films, and Mad Max: Fury Road pretty much plays like one. What dialogue there is just what is needed, nothing more. Subtle and simple!
As far as the action scenes, Miller is from that era of directing who knows that in order to be thrilled by action you have to be able to actually see it!! In the last 10 years so many directors of action films try to simulate action by means of ""shaky-cam"",rapid-fire editing, or blurry CGI that fly by so quickly that you cant really see the moves. This is just the lazy way to shoot action, as opposed to choreographing a well-thought out acting sequence and utilizing flesh-and-blood stuntmen to execute it. In addition Miller frames the action in the center of the frame, thus giving space to the objects within the frame so the viewer can see everything that is happening without getting confused, unlike the  action scenes that are just jumbled messes like in Transformers, and many of the Marvel movies. In addition, Millers use of CGI is also kept to a minimum, as 90% of the film was shot with practical (i.e. in-camera) effects and only 10% CGI. The CGI that is used is used sparingly and is often beautiful, (such as in the big sandstorm sequence) or just for a stylistic effect, not to beat the viewer over the head trying to impress you or to overpower the story, something that directors like Michael Bay could learn from.
The acting by the main principles are all good. Tom Hardy conveying more of Max's inner turmoil with his physicality, body movement, and facial expressions as opposed with dialogue. Chalize Theron offers a tough female action hero who is everybit of Max's equal, and there great supporting work by Nicolas Hoult as the War Boy Nux and Hugh Keays-Byrneas as the heavy Immortan Joe. The cinematography by 72 yr. old Oscar winner John Seale is exquisite and the score by composer Junkie XL is a great mix of propulsive action music and quite, Baroque-style string sections.
However, the real star of the show is director George Miller, who at age 70 has created one of the greatest pure action film of all time, but one that is also rich with themes such as nature vs. capitalism, of social and environmental decay, of matriarchy/patriarchy societies. Its all there, however subtle. Miller has raised the bar on action cinema,not by doing anything narratively groundbreaking, or a utilizing a ton of CGI,  but by returning to the roots of action cinema and doing it old-school! Mad Max: Fury Road hopefully will not only be the first of new adventures of Max, but also spark a Renaissance of action films the way they used to be done; old-school!!!",1433462400,9,3588,4.754414125200642
7231803,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Quite simply the most accomplished installment in the franchise. Yes, it has its minor problems (some plot holes/illogic that plague nearly all films), yet for the most part this is manic filmmaking at its Aussie best. After a decades-long purgatory in children's films, George Miller is back with a vengeance. This is filmmaking of the highest caliber: the acting, camerawork, stunts, practical effects, editing, music, and so on, are nearly flawless.

I really do not understand the complaints that it is a feminist polemic, or that Mad Max is reduced to the sidelines. First of all, whatever ""feminist"" content is in this film makes perfect sense within the context of its narrative, and is far from polemical. Secondly, Max has, since Road Warrior, been a secondary character to the plot, so this film is entirely within the spirit of the previous films. Moreover, Max has a crucial role in the film and kicks more ass in this movie than the first three movies combined.

MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is an action film masterpiece, the best MAD MAX since ROAD WARRIOR, and arguably George Miller's crowning achievement as a filmmaker.",1433376000,8,1128,4.962962962962963

7231806,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I find it interesting that this film is being promoted as a Mad Max sequel since about the only similarities are the desert landscape and the bizarre bad guy vehicles. The original Max movies are special because of the tension and power in the main protagonist, and the personal tragedy that drove him.  Here, we get an anodyne non-entity who miraculously transforms from slave to selfish prick to hero.

There is no story arc, only an endless chase. The bad guy is mostly pathetic. While the scenery + effects are cool, this is no substitute for not making a film that non brain-dead can watch and enjoy.",1433203200,14,605,4.644859813084112

The story of Mad Max, is quite different than the others. Max was the leader, the road warrior. This guy I am not sure what he is, he is basically replaced by a woman actor. The story itself is so weak, it about finding water, but I just lost interest in it. The WOW factor of the original story, the legend is gone.

Not one characters interested me although to be fair I lost interest so I did not care.

What is surprising is that some of the acting quite good, not that it matters as the story is so poor.

But I'm so glad I did, because this was an utterly fantastic thrill ride from start to finish. There's not one slow moment, not one wasted scene. We're thrown into the story with almost no explanation--but none is needed, because the visual storytelling is so deft and strong that we instantly understand what's going on. Instead of backstory and exposition, we understand the characters through the stellar performances of Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. The special effects were kept to a minimum, so instead of endless CGI cartoons bouncing around as if gravity doesn't apply, we get real cars. Real people. It adds tremendously to the excitement, as does the intense score. And while there's a lot of symbolism and deeper meaning there to be unpacked, the movie also works as a pure adrenalin rush.

7231814,1,B00YQJRYGY,"You may get fooled by the amazing cinematography of this movie. I'm not sure what they did, but it has to be a new kind of camera that they used, because it's just gorgeous. That said, ignoring the amazing visuals, the film is sadly utterly mediocre. I didn't buy the nonsense about water being a valuable resource that Immortan Joe used to control people. It's essential for life. Without it, people die. Simple as that. People don't live in places that don't have water, and if they do, they figure out how to access it. I didn't find that the film was overly feminist, but it did advocate socialism as some sort of answer to the world's problems.

Tom Hardy plays a very poor Mad Max. He's just a terrible actor. Nicholas Hoult as Nux outacted him in every way and quite honestly, would have been a better choice for Max. What a missed opportunity. There's probably a good reason Tom Hardy, wisely did not get as much lines and attention as Charlize Theron and Nux. If there is another one, I hope the part of Mad Max is recast. Hardy has no business acting to begin with.

Overall, decent movie, acceptable if you're just looking for something to do, but massively overrated by the critics. It's about as forgettable as the last Tron movie. You'll watch it once and never pick it up again.",1432944000,5,1293,4.497872340425532

7231820,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Gratuitously violent, completely pointless, unpretentious vehicle haute couture extravaganza.  I loved this film!  I have been a fan of the world since this franchise launched back in 1980, I remember the shock of watching in 1982, the anticipation leading into Thunderdome, and the incredible over the top characters, cars and world building.

This newest installation was no different - after all, we watch Mad Max for the stunts, the worlds, the cars, the characters.  It isn't there for deep commentary, it isn't trying to pass on a message or some world political view - it is simply an amazing feast of visual storytelling and excitement.

Mad Max is an intense world, and no longer really a character - this version of Max, played by Tom Hardy, is really just connective tissue into this world.  Hardy plays it subtly, like an original Max but with much less personality shining through (and you'll recall, the original max wasn't exactly effusive).  Theron is the bad ass in this film, and does an admirable job as the lead here.  A surprise third, the simple Nux, is one of those characters you're not sure if you love or hate - regardless, the situation evolves past the initial ""blood bag"" stage with Max strapped to the front of the car providing blood to Nux as he chases  - this character continues to add an element of surprise and craziness.

This is a world like no other, and the amazing chase scenes, incredible stunts, and sheer inventiveness will bring a smile to your face.  I loved the scenery, e.g. the crows in the desert area, or Max walking up towards the truck after a chase and finding a group of waif-like models (""breeders"") in his path.  Having a character like Joe played by a previous actor from Mad Max (Toecutter) personalizes the movie.  Vehicle designs were over the top - my favorite incorporated the big drums and a crazy guitarist in the front.  I know it got my blood pumping, and if I were in a chase scene like this in some crazy post-apocalyptic world, I would be totally amped up!  What fun!

George Miller's frame rate magic adds another dimension to the 'feel' of this film, creating a certain level of anxiety that fits perfectly here.

Go with no expectations other than entertainment at its most banal, and you will not be disappointed - in fact, perhaps as enthused as I was!",1432857600,89,2327,4.692118226600985

7231822,5,B00YQJRYGY,"First of all, if you enjoyed the first MAD MAX, then you'll almost certainly enjoy this one. It's got the same heart, drive, and attitude as the original without being a carbon copy of it. Mad props to George Miller, the man who wrote and directed all of the films. His dry, tribal vision of the apocalypse remains as solid and gripping as ever. (It's hard to believe nearly every non-Max film he's done has involved cute, CGI animals prancing around.)

Second of all, if you've never seen any of the Max films, know that they are exercises in Showing, Not Telling. One of the most common rules of scriptwriting is that the less dialogue, the better, since that means more is being communicated by the drama and visual aspect, which are the two most important components of a film. I've never seen the script for FURY ROAD, but it wouldn't surprise me if dialogue composed no more than 10-15% of it. The tale here -- of rebellion, redemption, and revenge -- is what amounts to three long action sequences strung together with a cobweb of exposition.

The majority of non-stop action films are dull because they confuse activity with action, filling the screen with energy, fire, and violence as a substitute for story. These grow tedious to watch, since the movies spend so much time on the speeding cars, fight scenes, and explosions that they leave no time to convince viewers that we should care about who's in those cars, fights, or flames. FURY ROAD carefully crafts its sequences so that they are as much about the character and story as they are about giving viewers something cool to look at. Not that there's nothing cool to look at; you've probably already heard about the flame-throwing guitar.

That makes it sound over-the-top, and it is, but in a way that makes you want to redefine where the ""top"" is. This future is heavily stylized (FURY ROAD LESSON #38: After the apocalypse, everyone's eyes will look AMAZING) but the sureness of its story-telling and the quiet (for the most part) confidence of our characters keeps it from seeming cartoonish. This is quite a feat, as anyone knows who's ever tried to explain the plot in depth to anyone.

Some fans have complained that this film's cast is saturated with female protagonists. As a result, our title character is forced to share a big chunk of his spotlight with others, notably Theron's Furiosa. If this is the sort of thing you think you might take issue with, you might not enjoy this film. Also, I feel sorry for you. No characters are extraneous, and whatever politics you think you can ascribe to the cast's heavy supply of estrogen, it's still never turned up nearly half as loud as the frenetic artistry that surrounds it and propels it forward. Although this is a serious movie, it is clearly designed not to be taken that seriously, so if you find yourself bristling at implied politics (the film contains hints at class warfare and wealth distribution), maybe you should take a step back and focus on that flame-throwing guitar for a second.

A film that sets a specific goal for itself and accomplishes it perfectly, MAD MAX sets the bar for the rest of this summer's inevitable deluge of action blockbusters.",1432857600,8,3191,4.721723518850988

Fortunately, the movie turned out to be a bargain and well worth it (the location and timing when we saw the movie allowed us to see it at a discount). As many know, Mad Max Fury Road stars a multiple number of todays popular actors/actresses (Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult and many additional well-known celebrities). The movie features a group of women banding together to get away from a very tyrannical leader. Two of the men end up becoming a significant part of the female entourage with dramatic results. The movie does center very much on the dystopian side, yet paints a powerful message of the amazing things that can happen when people unite together for a similar cause.",1432771200,9,784,4.688405797101449

7231825,4,B00YQJRYGY,"You want character motivations and script analysis, go elsewhere. This review's a little different.

Mad Max was never my cup of tea. Dont know what it is, but I never got into it. They were OK movies, I just never really cared. Why did I see the new one? It looked like it could be pretty good. And? Mad Max: Fury Road IS good.

No, its not Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a thoroughly good movie. Now, it has issues. Issues I have castigated movies for in the past. Whats the difference? Why does this movie get a pass? Ill tell you. And no, its not Because its a Mad Max movie. Thats lazy and stupid. A movie needs to be WORTH excusing the little problems beyond the genre or title. Thats what you call suspension of disbelief and it has little to do with its this kind of movie. It boils down to three VERY important items. So, rather than an in depth review full of insider nonsense about frame rates and character motivations, lets look at the three major reasons this movie works and so many others do not. And maybe afterwards Ill set a few angry anti-feminists straight on something.

1. Effort:
From everyone. Writing, directing, photography, stunts, costumeseveryone. One department fails, the movie as a whole can fail. See Stallones latest series of lazy cash-ins. If everyone works hard except for your main actor or the effects department, or the director, the whole movie starts to look and feel lazy and you totally lose your audience. I suppose this is why I cant stand most of the bad on purpose movies getting pumped out lately by the likes of The Asylum. The Asylum truly does not try. So many movies from them and from major studios are lazy on purpose and excused as a genre now. I can get more enjoyment out of Italian B-Flicks like Yor, or downright bad movies like Space Mutiny, than I ever will out of Sharknado. The reason is that the former actually tried and cared what they were doing in spite of their limitations, and The Asylum knowing makes garbage on purpose. That insults me as a viewer and its dangerous for movies as a whole.

It lowers the bar for movies as a whole when bad on purpose becomes more profitable than genuinely trying. Here George Miller made a bat-crap crazy movie that reads on the page like The Asylums wet dream, but theres a major difference, and no, its not budget. The original Mad Max cost a little less 400 thousand dollars to make in 1979. Adjusted for inflation thats around a million dollars, which was the budget for Sharknado. Meanwhile it is still objectively a better movie than Sharknado. You can enjoy either one, but one is obviously crafted with care and the other is obviously a product. So, whats the difference?

2. The desire to make a genuinely good movie:
I know its like kicking a crippled man at this point, butMichael Bay. Transformers had a budget of $150 million. Fury Road had a budget of $150 million. Both movies are huge action extravaganzas with minimalist plots and thin, surface level characters. Why is this movie better? George Miller actually cares what he churns out. Which goes back to effort. He cared more so he tried harder and so did everyone involved in this movie. I suppose there may be another factor, which brings us to

3: Talent:
George Miller is a talented director. He knows when to push, when to pull and when to leave well enough alone. He surrounds himself with talented people who work equally as hard and care about the finished project. He knows his material back to front and front to back and doesnt try to FORCE the audience to have a good time or feel something, he lets the material do it for him and he just films it.

And thats why this movie works.

A post Script on feminism in this movie, and the little boys who are angry about it.

Firstly, lets get something out of the way. If you're a feminist and you excuse a movie that is otherwise terrible because of the strong female characters? Thats about as stupid a reason to praise an otherwise bad movie as any Ive heard. Men, women, whatever. Good is good and crap is crap, and as much as Id like to see more strong female protagonists in Hollywood, I want them in GOOD movies. Luckily  this IS a good movie.

MEANWHILE, if you're a guy and you're pissed that there are so many tough ladies taking the focus off of Max and you're blaming feminism and Eve Ensler for corrupting your precious Max Max movie? Grow up and grow a set of balls that isn't threatened by a woman with a gun that doesnt need your help. Eve Ensler was there for one reason only; to advise George Miller and the actresses playing The Wives on the realities of sex slavery and human trafficking. Its the same reason military personnel were advising the War Boys. Expert consultation. Max isn't some perfect, impervious warrior. Sometimes he needs saving. Even the old movies made that perfectly clear. Having some ladies in there kicking tail and pulling his ugly butt out of the fire was Millers decision, plain and simple. And it was a good one. Want to know why?

This is the freaking apocalypse, man! Only the strong survive! If you expect to see ANY women after the apocalypse, you better get used to the idea of them being TOUGH. You think the only people who could ever hoist a rifle and throw a punch are dudes? Ive got a few female marines, MMA champs, and farmgirls who want word with you. And if you run you're just gonna die tired.

Time to grow up, boys.",1432771200,10,5413,4.4776876267748476
7231826,5,B00YQJRYGY,"A triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guilt-free indulgence of the early '80s action/adventure bubble. Max puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up, somehow topping itself over and over again, even when it seems like there's nowhere left to go. It's joyous anarchy, a world that thrives on all of society's dirty secrets; completely post-apocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than we'd like to admit. Of course, it's a visual powerhouse - a glowing example of art direction, stunt driving, cinematography and character design that's damn near unrivaled in modern cinema - but it's also an audio behemoth. Like Inception's deep bellow or Terminator's ominous rumble, Fury Road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent, effective use of bass. You feel that rumble? The ride's starting back up again. Junkie XL's accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match, the right blend of fuzzy, maxed-out guitar licks and incessant, pounding tribal drums. Perhaps most impressively, the film doesn't feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line. If anything, it revels in leaving that to the viewer, whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad, wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway. It's a raucous success, a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a two-hour surge of adrenaline. I loved it, constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first R-rated movie. Loved every minute.",1432771200,6,1562,4.988505747126437

7231828,2,B00YQJRYGY,"I don't watch remakes/reboots of classics. I made an exception for this film. I was wrong. This movie mostly disappointed me. More of my impressions below, with some SPOILERS.

I will not delve on the story, because I don't want to provide too many spoilers. Let's just say that it is all about a female road warrior named Imperator Furioza (Charlize Theron) who in the desolate wilderness of a broken world meets a guy named Max (Tom Hardy), then they run into some fast riding unpleasant fellows. There is a lot of chasing and fighting, some bad guys and good guys die, then they meet some unexpected allies and then there is more chasing and fighting, some bad guys and good guys die, it all leads to a finale about which I will say nothing and then we can start mental preparation for the unavoidable sequel. THE END.

There are some GOOD POINTS in this film:

- the character of Furioza and the way Charlize Theron played her: this film actually is more about her than about Max and she is the one really shining thing in this whole business and no, not because Charlize Theron is smoking hot  to the contrary, her character's attractiveness was actually purposefully reduced: she is mutilated, she has almost no hair, she wears rags and her only makeup is engine oil. No, the real interest of this character is actually in her personality and also in the talent of the actress who plays her. Kudos to George Miller and Charlize Theron for Furioza;

- some good action scenes: yes, there is A LOT of actions scenes in this film and quite a lot of them are of good quality  however see also below

- some cool vehicles: there is no denying that this is a strong point of this film

- the Rock n'Roll War Wagon: I will not say much more about it (you deserve to discover it by yourself) but that vehicle (as well as one of its occupants), was actually one of the few really GREAT ideas in this film!

- the Victoria's Secret Team: once again I will not say much about them, but because of their assets they are definitely an asset

- one bad guy is named Rictus Erectus  the character is actually quite lame, but still, he got this name)))

However, there is also a lot of BAD POINTS

- the character of Max is messed up like totally  SPOILER HERE: he is supposed to be a road warrior but all the time he needs women to save him; there is a part of the film when he is a helpless slave, then he is a grunting ape unable to speak, then suddenly he becomes the gentle and polite knight-errant, serving courteously a group of women He is also plagued by stupid visions and flashbacks  which is really such an idiotic and useless clich! Jeezus Iehovovitch Christ, this character was so ruined and emasculated as possible and as result Furioza outstages him entirely. I honestly think that it would be a better idea for the next film to drop him entirely and just make it all about another, less pathetic and more b@d@ss character

- villains are ridiculous, grotesque and frequently simply GROSS  but definitely NOT COOL. !! SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER INCOMING !!: making most of bad guys terminal cancer patients was NOT a good idea! Even worse was the idea of main villain being an overweight, very aged man whose body is covered in oozing purulent sores and other eruptions. I mean, what the heck George Miller, sir, how are we supposed to consider a very sick very senior citizen as a worthy opponent of Furioza!?

- not only villains are GROSS, but there are also many other GROSS elements and scenes  sorry, but me for one I don't take pleasure in watching grotesquely deformed human bodies, morbidly obese milking women, dead foetuses, etc.

- firearms are everywhere and there is an abundance of munitions; that is a very stupid mistake, because what made ""Mad Max 2: Road Warrior"" into such a great movie was the mixture of modern vehicles and medieval arsenal, with the two only guns being the equivalent of magic weapons. Here the presence of firearms ruins many of the action scenes  if only because the bad guys can never hit anything (sigh) but good guys never miss (re-sigh) as usual Incidentally, even if firearms are available, many bad guys simply refuse to use them and prefer to face Charlize Theron's Glock pistol with a club or a knife (sigh)

- there is an overkill of action scenes  if some are good, most are just very repetitive: bad guys arrive, boom, good guys kill them easily, more bad guys arrive, boom, good guys kill them easily, even more bad guys arrive, boom, Charlize Theron shoots them. It actually gets boring with time.

- there is no humour. Not even one little joke...

- some scenes are needlessly accelerated and also there is too much of ""shaky camera"" moments - it actually makes it difficult by moments to understand what just happened

- ONE LAST SPOILER! Last but not least, the MOST RIDICULOUS THING is that the most efficient warrior team in the whole film is a gang of grandmothers riding on Harleys, called Vulva Vanillas or something like that! I am not kidding  those Harley riding grey panthers are aged like between 70 and 80, which makes many action scenes a total joke, because how possibly can we feel any tension or excitement watching a match GRANNIES vs. CANCER PATIENTS!

CONCLUSIONS

1. This film is not worthy to shine the shoes of the guy who shines the shoes of the guy who shines the shoes of the original ""Mad Max 2: Road Warrior"", a film which didn't age, never will and still wears that crown!

2. George Miller got old and p---y whipped - and it shows.

3. Charlize Theron proves once more what we all knew ever since ""Monster"" - she is not only a top level looker but also a GREAT actress!.

4. Hollywood and its other Anglo-Saxon annexes seem to be less and less able to produce really good films - on another hand they sure learned how to make good trailers...

5. I am such an idiot. I had a good principle  never watch remakes. It allowed me to dodge a lot of infamous turkeys. However, baited by a very good trailer, rather than holding to my winning strategy I stupidly decided to leave my safe position and went to see this film. And now I feel sorry that I did it, as it was mostly a waste of time and money. With help of some potent potables this thing can probably be watched, but only once and you don't really need to see it the cinema  you can rent it on DVD once it is available.",1432771200,6,6365,4.467184801381692
7231829,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is the kind of blockbuster that seems to almost never be made anymore. The effects are mostly practical, the story and characters are interesting, and the social commentary is really on point. The original Mad Max is a lot of fun, and its sequel (The Road Warrior) is even better. With Mad Max: Fury Road, though, George Miller has outdone himself, creating a film that is a triumph of visual storytelling. Its nearly miraculous that he pulled this off; Mad Max: Fury Road was in development since the late 90s (when Mel Gibson was still set to star) and when the film was finally shot in 2012, it took another three years to be released due to editing and reshoots.

These are almost never good signs, but in this films case (not unlike Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now), all that extra time seemed to be in service of something; nothing here feels excessively labored over. Its just a hugely entertaining and expertly paced film, and theres an anarchic brilliance to the chase sequences that is hard to overstate; as in previous Mad Max films, certain shots are noticeably sped up or slowed down and this manipulation of frames is part of an aesthetic that fits a certain mood and tone that Miller is aiming for (and succeeding brilliantly at).

Some so-called Mens Rights Activists have dismissed the film as feminist propaganda, and its a sad fact that allowing a female protagonist to carry an action film is seen as a radical and controversial move, but thats where we are, apparently. (Serious question: Why is it considered radical when the main characters of a film are women, but totally normal when nearly every film is dominated by men?)

Just like Alfonso Cuarons Gravity or Ridley Scotts Alien, this films heroine (Imperator Furiosa, in a terrific performance from Charlize Theron) is smart, tough, and has complete autonomy over the decisions she makes. Its unfortunate that some men see that as threatening, but that discussion is for another time and place, I guess.",1432771200,13,2006,4.825581395348837

7231832,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max is BACK!!.....or is he?

Through out most of the film I wondered if I was watching a Mad Max movie, or a Charlize Theron action vehicle. This is the very root of the problem I had with the film.

Max (Tom Hardy) spends the first twenty minutes of the film looking like Bane with hair. His character spends the rest of the film as a side kick. This should not be the case, especially if you're going to call this a Mad Max film. Five minutes less of screen time and Max could have been written out of the piece entirely without making a bit of difference.

While I loved the stunt/action sequences (and isn't that really what you see films like this for??), the characters were criminally underdeveloped. This made it very difficult to sympathize with any of them (except Nicholas Hoult's character Nux). Even the arch villian of the piece isn't very fleshed out and carries little screen time. Immortan Joe is a bad guy, I get that....but what else is there to him and why is he really that scary? By the time the film ends, it didn't seem to be THAT hard to defeat him.

For all the critical praise, feminist hype, and adoration from the media as a whole, there really isn't a whole lot to be said here other than KABOOM!!!!!

Really...it was more like a ""thud"" than a kaboom.

Enjoyable at best, but a sad addition to a film legacy that George Miller created over thirty years ago. Maybe one could call this his ""Phantom Menace"". It was a big let down to this Max fan and probably several others as well.

I wouldn't mind seeing Hardy in the role again...but let's give Max more to do than be a Robin to some one else's Batman.",1432684800,6,1637,4.3475409836065575
7231833,1,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad max was to post apocalypse what Saving Private Ryan was to world war II.

That was the best way I could describe the original concept to my friend as we walked out the cinema together. Of course he had never watched the originals, and he didn't look like he would ever bother. He scoffed at this film. A little bemused that i could suggest Mad Max: Road warrior as  one of my favourites of all time.

Truthfully im just as shocked as he is. Im just as stunned the critics and fans are raving about this reboot.

You know im really really over the idea of reboots and remakes. It turns out almost always to be an insult and disappointment. A legacy ruined. A memory soured. This was a story that made sense when it was originally conceived 30 years ago. A story told with just the right motivation, just the right team of creators, the right actors,the right budget, the right place and at the right time. An original story and vision yet untold.

It worked when it worked and it cant be what it was 30 years ago. Because today, the post apocalyptic marvel that was the original trilogy has gone on to inspire and become the fabric of so many post-apocalyptic movies, games and books. Mad max is to post apocalypse what saving private is to world war II. Its style and its vision reverberates in every film made subsequently about that subject matter. That moment so long ago when I first watched road warrior and for the first time ever imagined the notion of a future where civilisation had ended and society had descended into tribal wasteland. 30 years ago George Miller created that awe inspiring world. A future wasteland that still inspires the style and vision of post apocalyptic genres today.

Now. Well now it was merely all those things my friend said it was. ""just another Water World""... just another post-apocalyptic action film. Well yeah. Its just another version of its original self. And I agree with him. Whats so good about it?

So what purpose does this reboot serve? Is it suppose to progress the story of the original. Is this the future? The past? Does it matter? Not really. Lets just borrow the original concept, and tell a short story. We can call it a reboot. Kids love reboots these days.

Little cheap throwbacks to the original. Thats what this was. Like I'm suppose to wet myself when I see that old hot rod of a V8 make its appearance or that scene when his two barrelled shotgun doesnt shoot. You know, just like it happened in the original road warrior. Oh what fun reboots are. oh the nostalgia. sheeesh. In the same vain as ""ill be back"" every time they reboot the terminator series.

Fury Road is successful at creating a unique, visual masterpiece in that no one has ever created anything quite like it. It has a simple story because that's all it needs. The movie is a ride. A very detailed ride that helps you lose yourself as a viewer in the desert dystopia that is Max's life.

7231837,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The genre of post-apocalyptic fiction has been on the minds of creators probably since the dawn of storytelling; a vision of what would happen after the world as was known disappeared in a cataclysmic event. Within the last few decades, this genre has become alternately more or less inventive, but it has become one of the mainstays of sci-fi storytelling. Back in 1979, Australian filmmaker George Miller added his own spin to the genre with MAD MAX, the beginnings of a post-apocalyptic wasteland where police officers like Max Rockatansky (played by Mel Gibson) did battle with roving bands of sociopathic driving gangs where the greatest possible resource was gasoline. Max lost his wife and son to the evils of these gangs, and began a quest for vengeance and eventual redemption. This was furthered in its first sequel MAD MAX 2 (released in the US as THE ROAD WARRIOR) and then seemed to be completed in the second sequel MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME. But now, thirty full years after THUNDERDOME, Miller has returned to The Wasteland with a new Max (literally, and perhaps figuratively), a fresh vision and a nearly perfect action film with MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.

The film opens in a way that is not typical for a film in this series; a voiceover from Max (now played by Tom Hardy) himself who finds himself almost immediately in a big heap of trouble. While the world seems to be no longer searching for the precious juice, referred to here in the series as ""guzzoline"", they search and pillage for other things, such as blood. The population of The Wasteland is largely made of mutated people and they need blood from un-spoilt humans which is just what Max becomes for the War Boys, a sort of cult of white-painted warriors for their leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the villainous Toecutter in the original film). Max is identified as a universal donor and is used as a ""bloodbag"" for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a somewhat inept War Boy who wants nothing else than to die in service to Joe so that he may go to Valhalla. Immortan Joe has power over the people of his tribe not just because he has the cars and the guzzoline, but because he controls the water. Meanwhile, travelling across The Wasteland is one of his great warriors Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) in a massive ""war rig"" to exchange with the other great tribes of Gas Town and the Bullet Farm, but in reality, she has absconded with Joe's five wives (made up of the likes of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zoe Kravitz) to bring them to safety. Joe orders their pursuit and soon Nux and his bloodbag are on their way as well as many others to hunt them down to get Joe's ""wives"" back. In the pursuit, Max frees himself and reluctantly joins Furiosa's crusade to get the women to something called The Green Place, but they have to run a terrifying and amazingly intense gauntlet of mostly harsh and unforgiving, but also hauntingly beautiful terrain, as well as seemingly hundreds in hot pursuit.

This might seem like a somewhat sparse breakdown of the plot, but that's kind of the point. The plot, while important, is really almost a backdrop for the most insane, balls-out, straight-forward, raw adrenaline action films I've seen since Gareth Evans' THE RAID 2. From the opening moments with Max and his famous V-8 Interceptor being pursued to the grand finale as Furiosa, Max, Nux and their companions face off against the vast array of wonderfully bizarre villains, this is almost all action with the scenes of drama and character being played out through the action or through some of the quieter moments. Miller and his co-writers Doug Mitchell and P.J. Voeten have invested obviously a lot of time and care into each of the characters, giving almost every single character a unique backstory that in most cases doesn't even appear on screen, but is felt in almost every frame. However, it is absolutely worth talking about that FURY ROAD is a film not without controversy.

Of course, some of the controversy is ridiculous, such as some Men's Rights Activists calling for a boycott of the film because of the fact that the most prominent roles in the film belong to women instead of Max himself. While the political ideology is horrifically misguided, the idea of gender and the roles of women in film, particularly in action films, is very pointed here. There is a true ideology being presented here as far as gender is concerned, and while it's just part of a whole, it's an incredibly important part as far as the equality of the characters. Women are seen by the villains (and often by Hollywood executives) as possessions or playthings, but are ultimately the heroes of The Wasteland. This idea has been treated with a lot of deserved respect. This idea of furthering women in the genre has garnered some controversy, but what is also controversial is the question as to whether or not this is a ""Mad Max"" film, and it's an absolutely valid question.

While Tom Hardy is excellent as Max, he doesn't quite seem like the Max Rockatansky of the previous films. His voiceovers and his extremely sparse dialogue is not very consistent with his character from past films, and he's almost persistently haunted by terrifying visions of people he failed to save, and one that continuously appears is a little girl. The first thought is that it's his daughter, but he didn't have a daughter; he had a son. So who are these people haunting him? On a comparative basis, Max has saved a lot more lives than he's failed to save. And one of Furiosa's comments about how she grew up in The Wasteland; based on Max's age and assuming they're about the same age and that Charlize is in NOT her late teens, the timeline for the whole series is off. And also, fans of the film know that Max's V-8 Interceptor was destroyed in THE ROAD WARRIOR, so how does he have it at the beginning of the film? And why would Miller cast Keays-Byrne as the villain 35 years later here when he's already played Toecutter in the original film?

The only answer that I have been able to come up with that makes any kind of sense is that this MAD MAX film is effectively a pseudo-sequel that also acts as a reboot of the series as well. Max Rockatansky is now less of a man and more of a legend, and what Miller is doing here is setting him up as something of a mythological figure; the lone warrior of The Wasteland and a quintessential anti-hero. If this is the case, the film works perfectly. And honestly, even if it's not the case, the film is still amazing. Miller directs this film with the verve and energy and style of a director a third his age, but with the gravitas and sense of visual storytelling of a seasoned pro, which is a hard balance to pull off. And with a rumored 480+ hours of film and thousands of storyboards, he made damn sure that this film was going to look as good or better than anything in the cinemas in recent years, and this is especially true in the night sequence. And the action... My God, the action. Miller is smart enough to let the audience breathe for a long enough period of time before things get insane again, but is even smarter because he doesn't wait too long for the audience to possibly tune out and get bogged down by over-exposition or excessive or unnecessary dialogue. The characters, from Max and Furiosa and Nux to the ""wives"", the warrior women we meet at the end of the second act to Joe and the crazed War Boys are all vivid enough to be given even more screen time. The visual effects and stunts being overwhelmingly practical (barely 10% of the film has CG-enhanced effects) have a greater weight to them than recent CG extravaganzas like AGE OF ULTRON or FURIOUS 7.  The cinematography by John Seale makes every single frame look like something you'd want to hang on your wall, and Margaret Sixel's extremely meticulous editing makes everything pop in just the perfect place.

Along with the aforementioned Hardy, the performances in the film are pretty much flawless. While this is a Mad Max film, the film firmly belongs to the incredible Theron who does, in my opinion, one of the most intense, haunting, and powerful performances in an action film aside from Sigourney Weaver in the ALIEN films. Hoult is also a standout as Nux, a War Boy who finds new purpose to his life while he's with Furiosa and Max. And while Furiosa has already gained a loyal and loving following (and deservedly so) that could propel a standalone film for just her character, it appears that since Hardy has signed on for three more films, we could be seeing a lot more madness in The Wasteland in the years to come.

MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is not just another sequel or another rehash of a beloved franchise; it's a step into a much larger world as it expands the existing mythology, brings new and exciting players to the board, puts the action in a more grand and epic scope, and blends them all together in a frenzied dust storm of blood and engines and comes out as what may be one of the best films of the year and one of the greatest action films in the last decade.",1432684800,13,9075,4.618339529120198

What? Why? The whole thing read like an even thinner re-hashing of Waterworld from start to finish. Unless you have the wonder of a child, and can watch the same thing over and over again with equal joy, you might find yourself (like me) increasingly bored after the first 15 minutes. Loud guitars, banging drums, blood everywhere, the desolation of the desert, a water shortage, an evil dictator...It was all extremely over the top, and extremely bad film.",1432598400,23,633,4.81651376146789

7231841,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I bought the hype and was a bit let down. Yes, the action scenes were thrilling but that only goes so far in my book. I couldn't tell who's vehicle was getting creamed at times... frustrating.  Max never really shined for me. Seems like Theron was more of the central character while Hardy grunted along unsure of himself. I was ready for him to really take charge since the movie is named after him? He was very robotic even during fight scenes. I just didn't believe he really wanted to win. The director knows how to create a car chase and think up creepy, horror style characters but I was looking for more impact from our lead.",1432598400,10,632,4.401709401709402
7231842,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I went to see Mad Max purely on the rave reviews from various friends. As someone who went in with zero familiarity with the franchise, I would describe it thusly:

If a steampunk Cirque de Soleil show, the costume designer for the Labyrinth, the post-apocalyptic desert setting of Nausicaa, the pyrotechnics of Trans Siberian Orchestra, the lawlessness of the American western, and the vehicular warfare of the Fast and the Furious had a baby and that baby was certifiably insane and entertaining as hell, that would be Mad Max.

It just wasn't like anything else I've ever seen. And I really appreciated how, given the choice between forced subplots or more explosions, Mad Max opted for more explosions.  I think I caught less than half of the dialogue in the theater, but it didn't matter, because the visual storytelling was flawless.  A must-watch for action genre fans.",1432512000,31,876,4.938775510204081
7231843,5,B00YQJRYGY,Mad Max: Fury Road is a welcome return to the franchise. George Miller reboots his classic series with a modern facelift while still managing to keep it stylistically similar to the original films. I was personally blown away with the filming and visuals of this movie. It had me interested and at the edge of my seat from start to finish. I enjoyed the movie so much that I actually went back to the movie theater to see it again. That is something that I never do! I recommend this film to anybody who liked the original three films or anybody who likes action movies in general. Go see this movie!,1432512000,5,600,4.414414414414415
7231844,5,B00YQJRYGY,"If you overthink the Mad Max franchise, you're doing both the franchise and yourself a disfavor. The most one can say about this movie not fitting in to the canon is that it is *too* good. You should have two understandings entering the film: A) the series was never high literature, and B) Fury Road is the best movie in the Mad Max franchise.

The original, taken without context, is an awful film. Understanding that it was made on such a low budget and that it defined a genre, it is pretty awesome, then. But stack it against more modern movies and it just doesn't hold up. It is much in the same way that Metropolis or The French Connection are just unwatchable today. Don't give too much credence to the original. Respect it for what it did. Understand its limitations.

That is, however, the challenge of film. How do you separate the film from the context in which the film was created? Casablanca and Citizen Kane, as much as we lionize them, do not stand up to our modern expectations for films. Does that make them bad films? Today, yes, it does. But we continue to watch them because it teaches us something about what it means to make film. It's history. We see where our modern notions of film come from. If you're at all a film enthusiast--rather than just a popcorn-munching movie consumer--that is essential.

With that in mind, the original film did a lot for small-budget film. The Road Warrior is a superior film in comparison to Mad Max, but you don't get B without A. And Thunderdome is--in my mind--the quintessential big-budget, 80s-Hollywood, action-film. I wouldn't go so far to say Thunderdome is as good as Blade Runner, but it's certainly better than most other classics of action-genre stalwart films like The Terminator, Robocop, or Escape From New York. This is more Alien than Total Recall.

So with that in mind, the writing, the acting, and the production quality of Fury Road are light years beyond the original movies. I didn't know Hollywood was capable of making such a tight action film, with superb acting, with excellent cinematography, with so little reliance on CG, with decent direction, with a semi-decent story line, IN A SEQUEL, in this day and age. I'm not trying to equivocate on the story issue. This movie set its priorities on action--as so many do, as it should--and also delivered on far more, while not fundamentally insulting our intelligence in other areas.

It just boggles the mind to think about how good this film is, considering its progeny. I just don't understand how this film got made.",1432425600,6,2553,4.7152466367713
7231845,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max Fury Road! All i can say is wow, wow and wow!!!!!
it had me in electrifying joy. It tells the story of The Road Warrior. Max wanders the wasteland, in search of a righteous cause. Years after his family was killed, And after escaping ThunderDome, and defeating Lord Humungus, Max is captured by the War Boys where he must escape on the fury road! Just to be clear, whoever thinks that fury road is a reboot? It's not!! No matter what! Max still had his family killed by ToeCutter and still road into ThunderDome. It's still the same story!",1432425600,5,547,4.425742574257426
7231846,3,B00YQJRYGY,"As one online reviewer quite wittily observed, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is an experience akin to being rattled around inside a rusty biscuit-tin for two hours.

Don't get me wrong, Brendan McCarthy's production design and the visual pyrotechnics are spectacular, but beyond that, I don't think there's much to recommend it.

Horribly ham-fisted opening narration (which is the impoverished grandchild of the haunting, elegiac narration which opened ""Mad Max 2""), negligible plot, chronological discrepancies and plot-holes the size of a Mac Truck, mind-numbingly simplistic sexual politics, and as good an actor as Tom Hardy is, he's not a patch on Mel Gibson in the role.

Mel had eyes that had witnessed chaos, madness & anarchy and the brutal, steely resolve to see events through to their apocalyptic conclusions.

And Tom? Well, Tom just twitches a lot.

Max is also an ancillary character in this film rather than the driving force. The protagonist in this film is really Charlize Theron's ""Furiosa"" - and as good as she is in it, if a film bears the ""Mad Max"" title, I expect to see Max front-and-centre. George Miller should really have had the courage of his convictions, dispensed with Max entirely and just called the film ""Furiosa's Road"" (Subtitle: A Story Set In The World Of Mad Max) as Max's role could have been taken by pretty much anyone. I can see why a lot of long-time fans of the first two films in the series (we don't talk about ""Beyond Thunderdome"") feel gypped by it.

My advice? See it on the big-screen, goggle at the practical effects, real stunts and pretty colours and then go and rent a film called ""The Rover"" starring Guy Pearce and Robert Pattinson (which was not only the best film of 2014 but also the genuine spiritual heir to the first two Mad Max films).",1432425600,5,1791,4.798701298701299
7231847,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Fueled with high intense octane from the get go - this adrenaline injected film gives little room for dialogue however it has a simple and strong enough plot for everyone to understand.  Character development takes a slight back seat (pun intended) in this devastating ride of visually phenomenal proportions.  The choreograph of the live action sequences are incredible even though much of it was aided with some special effects.  It could use a little back story to the female lead role of Imperator Furiosa played by Charlize Theron and the main villain, but this movie is not really about giving a clear cut picture to all of its characters but is supposed to hijack your senses into a sequence of events in this post apocalyptic world and hope you survive like Max Rockatansky.  I like how equal screen time is given to Furiosa the main heroine who shows to be a relentless bad-ass. It's brutal, cunning, exhilarating, daring and just a great ride into a hell storm of metal, dirt and flames. I really recommend seeing this.",1432425600,2,1029,4.796610169491525
7231848,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The true stars of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are the vehicles. Director George Miller has outdone the mean machines of ""Road Warrior"" and created a fleet of twisted, hypersonic, reptilian, heavy metal monsters that are nearly hallucinogenic in their creation. One of them, a megasaurus of drums, sound speakers and a sound stage with a freak playing a double-guitar/flamethrower, should accompany the Rolling Stones on tour.
  There is indeed a plot to this film, and a worthy one at that. However, it pales before the visuals, added brilliantly by a score that throbs right into your gut and makes you gasp for breath whenever the movie hits a rare quiet spot. As will the visuals, especially one that includes a dust storm that will drag you to the edge of your seat.
  So leave your intellect at home, eat the popcorn during the previews (as it will soon drop out of your, sweaty shaking hands) and enjoy the ride. And oh, what a ride it is!
  One final word. Charlize Theron....I want that TRUCK!",1432425600,4,994,4.683908045977011
7231849,5,B00YQJRYGY,"In the future, the world is an industrialized labor intensive oligarchy. Women are used as ""breeders."" Furiosa (Charlize Theron) whose name sounds like a Harry Potter spell, absconds with a group of women and heads east toward ""the green land."" She is pursued and confronted and that is basically the story in a nutshell. Mad Max (Tom Hardy) who can't recall his name, becomes a prisoner, universal donor, hood ornament, fighter, ideas man, and a fuel injector. His lack of dialogue made him a rather boring character and when he spoke, they weren't gems like other little speaking characters...""I'll be back.""

In spite of the limited personality of the title character, the rest of the film is action packed as goes the Hollywood remake trend to please the younger audiences who prefer video game action over an involved plot. The left has proclaimed this a ""feminist"" film due to the role of Theron as a leader rebelling against the order and will of men. There may be a message there somewhere within the recess of what amounts to a shallow popcorn film, but I didn't desire to think that deep.

The action is almost non-stop. This would have an appeal to those who love monster trucks, dirt bikes, pretty girls, and demolition derbies.

Now at one point, there is a discussion of traveling in one direction for 160 days on bike. Assuming they ride a modest 500 miles a day, they could circle the globe 3 times (proper land bridges) yet they...

Break out the popcorn.

 It should've been someone who can carry that role & own the role.
This movie was all about Furiosa & Charlize Theron made her amazing.
Max was just in the background really. TBH he was probably not even necessary in this movie.

Top Notch car chases & explosions. like nothing I've seen in years.
hard to tell whats CG & whats real.

the reason I didn't give this a 5 is because there really isn't a plot.
& when they tried to give you some back story, you just end up WANTING MORE MORE ACTION.
What little story you do get, is pretty without soul. It feels empty
So it had a bit of an identity crisis there.

Most of the other actors in this were forgettable.

7231853,4,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a 2015 action film directed by George Miller.  This film is the fourth installment in the ""Mad Max"" film series, which are also directed by Miller.  To start this review, I must say that this is one of the best action movies in recent memory. ""Fury Road"" stars Tom Hardy as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, who replaces Mel Gibson from the original films.  Max is living in a desolate, post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a cult leader who controls his followers with the last remaining water supply.  Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a subordinate of Joe's, begins a mission to collect gasoline.  However, Furiosa has secretly smuggled away Joe's Five Wives, women specially selected for breeding, in an attempt to liberate them from Joe's clutches.  When Joe finds out, he sets out on the Fury Road with his War Boys in pursuit, with Max along for the ride.  What follows is some of the best action sequences in film.  This film used 80% practical effects, with CGI being used very minimally.  The practical effects, in addition to the production design, editing, and score, are what make this film so amazing.  The film is perfectly paced, and you barely realize that two hours have gone by whenever you're finished watching.  This is the first Mad Max in 30 years.  George Miller took a break from Mad Max during this period to direct the ""Happy Feet"" films, but here he returns to his Mad Max roots for with full furious force.",1432339200,10,1473,4.755905511811024
7231854,5,B00YQJRYGY,"It is an interesting and, at first discombobulating choice to tell the story without much in the way of exposition.  But what exactly did you need to know that you didn't?

Important information:
1) A warlord named Joe keeps hundreds of people as slaves.
2) One of his deputies decides to escape with some of those slaves.
3) If they're caught, the slaves will be raped, the deputy will be tortured, and everything will end badly for everyone we care about.
4) They need to not get caught.

That's enough movie for you, right?  The stakes are high if you have any imagination, because every single visual tells you just how bad Furiosa et al will catch it if Joe gets his hands on them again.  The effects are superb-- all practical-- and the pacing keeps your attention.  Sometimes the sudden dialogue bursts are jarring, but the nonverbal acting from just about everyone is on point.

All of the above is what makes Fury Road a good action movie.  What I found particularly satisfying, however, was the movie's handling of its female characters and their capabilities.  When writers try to write a ""strong woman"" they tend to fall into one of two traps: she's grating and overeager, but not ultimately that capable; or, she's a kung-fu waif who beats up men four times her size while looking pretty.  The women in Fury Road are not these things.  They're much realer.  I hate when writers think that, to make women cool, they must make us essentially magical creatures who win fights through the power of disbelief suspension.  Fury Road's female characters lose fistfights, but they win the day by jumping to fight in every other way that they can.

...oh yeah, and Max is in there.  Look guys, ""Mad Max"" film doesn't *necessarily* mean he's the focal point character; it just means the movie takes place in his universe and is therefore a part of that franchise.  I get the surprise but I don't get the ire.  It's a good film.  Be happy.",1432339200,429,1941,4.625730994152047
7231855,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The best thing I could say about MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is that director George Miller picks up right where THUNDERDOME left off, not once does he betray the fact that 30 years has passed since the last time we visited his awesome post apocalyptic world and spent time with survivor and former cop, Max Rockatansky. This movie could just as easily been the fourth installment released in 1988 and starring Mel Gibson.

FURY ROAD spends little time exposition or backstory as the movie opens with Max being captured in the opening scene by the minions of Immortan Joe, a monstrous warlord who rules a desert oasis like a feudal master-a place where water, fuel, blood, and human flesh are precious commodities.  Like Lord Humongous and Auntie Entity before him, Immortan Joe wields power through the constant threat of brutality, and all either serve him blindly or cower under his heel.

But Joe has a problem which presents an opportunity for the captured Max: Furiousa, one of his loyal lieutenants has turned against him and fled into the wastelands with Joe's harem of young lovelies, who exist only to breed for their master.  During the ensuing battle, Max, who is being slowly drained of his blood, makes his escape and reluctantly throws in with Furiousa and the girls as they are relentlessly chased across the desert by Joe and his extended family of post apocalyptic goons.

That is pretty much it for the plot, about which some people have complained, bitching over a lack of character development and story.  I'm really at a loss for words when people complain that there is too much action in a movie.  The characters are very much defined visually with  quick snippets of dialog, and I would say FURY ROAD  has about as much plot as either THE ROAD WARRIOR or BEYOND THUNDERDOME.  This is not some convoluted super hero movie, everything is very basic-you fight like hell to survive or you die.

What is great about FURY ROAD is the lack of obvious CGI; Miller gave his stunt people a real workout as they jump and caper atop huge mechanical mutants racing at incredible speeds through barren country.  Miller's camera is never still, it swoops high overhead and then down to the ground in the blink of an eye; nobody puts the viewer in the middle of the action better, and of course there are the patented shots with the camera mounted to the front bumper-a staple of all MAX movies.

There is a strain of pop culture feminism running through the movie: women are oppressed nurturers, while old men in authority endlessly fight with each other over property, power and possession. Or it could be a dig at Islamic fundamentalists like ISIS who would rule with an iron hand through terror and reduce women to the level of property.  But no one's being fooled here, we bought a ticket to see trucks and cars go real fast and then crash into each other-the video equivalent of a thrill ride.

The only really murky part about FURY ROAD is the timeline, it's not clear how much time has passed since THUNDERDOME; Max appears to have hardly aged at all, yet this movie gives us the feeling that at least a generation or more has passed since the collapse of civilization.

Tom Hardy makes a good replacement for Mel Gibson, you could almost count his lines of dialog on two hands while most of his acting is done with his eyes.  Charlize Theron is Furiousa, a female road warrior, and something not seen before in this series: a perfect match for Max.  Nicholas Hoult is Nux, one of Joe's junior brutes who has a change of heart when circumstances throw him in with Max and the girls.  Hoult is one of the best young actors working today and gives the best real performance in the movie.  Josh Helman, who played Bill Stryker in DOFP, turns up here as one of Nux's compatriots. Hugh Keays-Byrne is truly scary as Immortan Joe, with his death's head mask, he is could well be one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen.  Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in the original MAD MAX more than three decades ago now.

But the real star of FURY ROAD is George Miller and the vivid world he created on screen; a hellish future where humanity survives in state of perpetual insanity.  If it does not seem quite so original anymore, that's because in the intervening years so many film makers have borrowed from Miller's vision.  If you want proof, just binge watch THE WALKING DEAD.",1432339200,3,4365,4.653645833333333

No characters had the charm or originality of the little blond boy or the helicopter pilot from Mad Max I and II.  I gave the movie two stars instead of one because (1) Tom Hardy (Max) and Charlize Theron (Furiosa) have personal charisma (although not much could be done with their one dimensional roles), (2) the chase scenes were OK, (3) the guitar player was somewhat funny, and (4) Nux's character, although entirely predictable, was somewhat engaging.  Consistent with the movie's lack of originality, it was obvious from the beginning that Nux was destined to turn ""good"" and reach Valhalla through ""good acts"" rather than service to Immoten Joe.  In sum, while not as bad as Mad Max III, this movie was a disappointment, especially given the ""rave"" reviews.",1432339200,8,993,5.104938271604938

* If you are an anti-feminist or a person who is bothered for the portrayal of women as action heroes then by all means avoid this movie - because damn, ""What a lovely day"". the women have stolen the show, with extreme high praise to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa. Two hours of nonstop adrenaline, mixed in with a hefty amount of emotion, it eats at you wanting even enemy-turned allies to stay alive throughout.

Tom Hardy is the perfect replacement as Max Rockatanksy, and it lives up to every amount of hype that you had any worries for. The film was beautifully shot, the wasteland was like nothing i had ever seen before in a post-apocalyptic world. And to think that 99% of the time, you are watching real stunt work, and real practical effects: every vehicle is real and crafted to be menacing. I haven't felt this happy over an action movie in over a decade.

Fury Road has set the bar high for all action movies after it, and is going to be one difficult experience to top for the remainder of the year. Oh, and how can we forget the guy with the flamethrower guitar? George Miller, you just gave the middle finger to all of Hollywood thereafter. This is how a cinema should be done. *

----------

'** this section of the review will clear up anything that people need to know, regarding story and character development. a lot of the reviews that are one-star obviously have never seen the original mad max trilogy or just plainly don't understand it. because 1: this is NOT a remake, and this is NOT a reboot. this is a REIMAGINING of the Mad Max universe. Like how James Bond gets a different Bond. 2: they also have no idea of any of the lore, nor the universe of Mad Max itself.

the story isn't spoon fed to you, which is what i liked. there's little dialogue because there's no time for it. you're trying to escape and survive a mad world, and the last thing you want to do is talk. the saying ""actions speak louder than words"" applies very much to this series, as well as its visual presentation. and when they do speak, they're very brute about it. there's enough characterization to make the wasteland as defining as say the mythology of Middle Earth. its not to a grand scale, but it is there. i love when a film is defined in story by the actions that are portrayed, like how Max is used as a ""blood bag"", because his blood is universal and pure and free of radiation and harmful chemicals, or that these War Boys are literally suicide warriors, and that they'll do anything for their god (Immortan Joe), which turns out that he wasn't this diety that everyone played him out to be. you could see fault in these warriors, as they've never really have grown up to have mother's love, which is why Nux broke down and had a change of heart, after his failing and letting one of the Wives die. we don't get any explanation in dialogue over these things, but we can see it clearly in their eyes and in their actions. its an adrenaline ride, and its taking you with it.

One specific complaint that i find by many, is that Max hardly speaks, or he is hardly the star of the role. There are two things to keep in mind about that. 1. Max is broken. he is a damaged man who lost his family. the only thing he has in this world is himself. He trusts no one, he speaks to no one. he is a drifter, a road warrior. a ""Man with No Name"". he has trouble coping with humanity itself, and has very little means to interact with anyone. And when he does, he does it willingly out of the goodness that he still has. and 2. Furiosa is in many ways, exactly like Max. she lost everything. her childhood taken from her. she has been waiting a very long time for redemption and to do the right thing for the people she cares for. Max and Furiosa come to a point where they require each other's co-operation, and they need each other in every sense to survive the road war and free the Wives from Immortan Joe. **

----------

in conclusion, see this movie for yourself. if you love action, if you love the lore of Mad Max, and just like seeing men and women kick ass on screen, there is no reason to skip this film. this film will be lauded as one of the greatest in cinema history, and there's more than enough reasons as to why.",1432339200,9,4362,4.33578431372549

7231862,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Wow this movie is one beautiful visual treat from beginning to end, very worthy of its five star reviews everywhere, if your a fan of the originals then this truly is a masterpiece in the post apocalyptic sci-fi genre, this is mad max as its meant to be, George Miller has come back and done a marvellous job of resurrecting his franchise this can only be described as what was probably his vision for the original back in 1979, this is one long two hour action piece full of amazing looking vehicles and stunning stunts and crashes, just the best vehicle based action in years, Max is now played by the brilliant Tom Hardy who does a great job, his character is torn up over the loss of his family, it haunts him wherever he goes, he ends up helping Furiosa (Charlize Theron) from escaping the clutches of the evil gang leader Immortan Joe, together they journey the road ahead to freedom as all hell is chasing after them, Theron is amazing in this movie too and certainly shares credit with Hardy as a lead, the rest of the entire cast is great too, the visual effects look stunning and are the real star of the movie, the vehicles are amazing and the whole design of the beautiful dangerous landscape around them where the action takes place is stunning too, the story maybe a tad shallow but who cares, its an epic visual feast on the eyes and there really is no other movie quite like it out there right now!! A must see, its the craziest action movie of the year for sure!!!
The soundtrack score is also very cool and really helps drive the epic action sequences!!

7231863,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I think it's official: Charlize Theron is the baddest badgirl since Ripley whupped aliens. Oh, there was kind of a chick-y theme going on, with brave warrior woman saving princesses in distress, but that (and what they're saved from) just tweaks the classic version of damsel[s] in distress. Mostly, it was non-stop action in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with all the warring warlords, over-the-top antics by the foot-soldiers, and somewhat goofy-looking salvaged hardware you could hope for. Plus a few touches (like that miking barn) that won't suit gentler tastes.

Fast fun, a crazy kind of car pron (not the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fast-Furious/dp/B00HLTD8RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fast & Furious</a>&nbsp;kind), and some great chase scenes and stunts.

Crazy dood with a flame throwing guitar and some crazy demented thugs and dumb mad max flash backs. There was no story or nothing that linked mad max to the original movies. It was a movie of its own just one chapter of action and left the other 6 chapter out. Nothing drew me into what could of been a great movie.,1432252800,5,490,4.114583333333333
7231866,1,B00YQJRYGY,"A note. The feedback for negative reviews on this title is clearly being faked. I got more negative feedback on this review in one day than the top-rated spotlight review got in total after being up a week. There is a similar pattern on most reviews that are less than four stars. And the more serious the writing of the negative review, the more negative feedback it seems to be given.

-------------
I'm reviewing this as a ""mad max"" film. It gets one star because its not a Mad Max film and the star is not Tom Hardy. This is a Charlize Theron film. You can tell how much of a joke Hardy is by the fact that Theron even gets the lead position on the early box art for the video releases. Its all been bait-and-switch combined with false advertising. Director Miller doubles down on all the bad ideas from his last Max film (Thunderdome) without seeming to recognize that those ideas killed this franchise for decades the first time around.

People inexplicably use words like ""intelligent"" to describe this thing. I don't see it at all. The basic story is Charlize rescuing a bunch of playboy bunnies from evil bikers. I mean I suppose there is some interest in what life will be like for a collection of supermodels and Jason Statham's girlfriend after the end of the world, but I'm not sure I would call it intellectual or deep thinking. I also don't see the feminism. This is a story where everyone has to risk their lives to save the ""popular"" girls who are the most important thing in the whole world. The lead female character (Charlize) is the familiar trope of female-video-game-character. She is there to enable the action, but is not a developed character. She is Sonja Blade/Lara Croft/Jill Valantine and so on.

Tom Hardy's Mad Max in the film is both an incredible wuss and a perpetual victim. Its hard to know if he should be faulted because the script and the director give him nothing to work with. Someone sure liked Blood transfusions as a plot device is all I can say. He is humorless, he broods, he drowns in self-pity. And he can't redeem himself because he is really the sidekick in the film.

As far as Furiosa goes, there is no character and no character development. The character seems mostly designed just to hammer home that Max is a useless wuss.

On a technical level, George Miller does what George Miller has been doing since ""Road Warrior"" with these films. He creates an ever-more elaborate fantasy distopia with visuals, speech and invented social rituals. But as with Thunderdome, no matter how elaborate all the background stuff in these films gets, they can't make up for a bad story or the lack of a story. Yes. Its nice eye candy. But not that nice.

The other good thing I can say is that Miller as director still has a great sense of pacing in action films. But I think the film is doomed to disappoint financially. Miller made a 200+ million dollar action film to please the critics at the New York Times and the New Yorker.",1432166400,53,2970,4.542056074766355
7231867,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The Mad Max Film Trilogy hold a very special place in my heart
I grew up on these 3 Films each one holds so many good memories
The 4th Mad Max Film was in Developmental Hell  for 15+ years (This one was on those Film during the early Internet days would always create massive Rumors) Keep in mind then there were No jerk-off Trolls!

George Miller belongs in the List of Underground Gonzo Style Writer/Director that didn't kiss @ss and play the typical Hollywood Games to get a Movie made He does things on his terms much like (George A Romero, John Carpenter,  John Waters, David Lynch, Tobe Hooper,  Don Coscarelli, Dan O'Bannon, Kathryn Bigelow,  Lucio Fulci,  Dario Argento, Clive Barker, Craig R. Baxley, Fred Dekker)  If you Love this flick check out each one of these Director's The mainstream Public Needs to give each one of these Individuals major respect and love for doing Things there way

On to my Love Letter aka Review of this Very Special Film
First of Unlike The Avengers: Age of Payola I Love this film................
It's close to Flawless in every way
Over 80% of the effects are practice, stunts, make-up and sets and you can tell Everything looks so real and Organic!
Good God in 2015 having a film made this way is not even thinkable But,  George Miller  is a Real Honest to God Director he isn't sitting at a PC making effects he Creates and films  everything and to say that isn't refreshing is the Understatement  of the decade!
WB has done some pretty hanus things through-out the years But, getting behind this was very cool
The film is simple:  It's a Relentless 2hrs of Pure insanity that Never lets up at the same time it just looks stunning and beautiful with boatloads of blood and gore + H2O
Trust me when i tell you This was the fastest 2hrs of my Life (I wanted so much more) 'Cause everything works so good
It's one of those flicks you have to go back and watch There is so much going on screen you'll miss alot the detail in everything makes it a multi-viewing experience!
Did I mention I Love this film????
The cast is perfectly Cast
Tom Hardy is without a doubt the perfect ""New"" Version of Max (When i first heard he was cast I wasn't sure) But, people forget Tom Hardy is a Rockstar he is a great actor but, That Stupid Dark knight Rises role kind of screwed him.... His portrayal of BANE would've worked if the Editor didn't go in and mess with his voice. Tom Hardy perfectly cast
Charlize Theron is without a Doubt IMO the best Female actress of My Generation  (Besides Orphan Black's  Tatiana Maslany)
She believed so much in the Script & Director she shaved her head for this role!!! For any female to do that it's just prof she's a Legit Actress (You can't name 10 actresses who have done this for roles)
Charlize can take any role and just make it her own (You don't see Flawless Beautiful Women who have the type of Talent Charlize has)
She doesn't rest on her Beauty!  Furiosa is a very interesting Character and she is every bit a part of the film as Max! Her performance is on the same level as Heath Ledger's Joker
(That might sound like a insane statement Go See the flick and Prove me wrong)
Nicholas Hoult is in a way the Character you see this world through his eyes and he starts of kind of Lame but, he has this cool transformation (which in all Honesty I didn't see coming)
Getting Hugh Keays-Byrne to return in this as a New Villain was such a out of the box idea it works
Immortan Joe is one of the most Darkest Bad Guys I've ever seen (There are so many strange, things going on with him) I don't wanna spoil it
Immortan Joe is The BEST Villain of all 4 Mad Max films 'Cause he's so Scary,Dark, & Twisted and it makes total sense
Nathan Jones was good too but, you don't get enough of him IMO (The scenes he are in are Great But, you just don't get enough of him)
The Bullet Farmer played by Richard Carter  is just another whacky bad guy (every scene he is in works) Minor Spoiler he Gets Blinded and wraps this cloth around his eyes and makes this very smart comment about being Blind Justice or something along those words
all the women who escaped with Furiosa  worked They Looked at times to Perfect But, there is a Simple reason for that
Go See this film... Support it
The action scenes are just awe inspiring Awesome (The Stunts and some of the deaths look Real and they are Brutal) Like when you see one of the Brides fly under one of the Vehicles I sear to God i know there was some trick to it But, it looks so real and it's jarring due to the fact the way her body falls is scary
The Opening Set piece looks amazing (The Citadel was a cool idea) everything else is just a relentless Chase of blood, sweat, and tears
The vehicle all look Organic there is a style to various ones  (One is this Massive Truck or whatever with 6-8 Guys playing Tribal drums on the rear while in the front of the same vehicle there's this creepy looking Albino playing a Guitar with Flames coming out the end!
My only disappointment is the death of some of the good characters (But, that's a Mad Max Film for you people get Killed in insane Horrid ways)
This is a Perfect example where everything Critics say is absolutely True (This Film deserve all the Hype, and Positivity  it's gained
Amazing in every possible way this is without a Doubt one of the Best Movies i've seen in along time  10/10
I hope this 3-D Blu Ray gets gets a Loaded Version with extras and maybe a Unrated Director's Cut
Consumers get a  Gimmicky Unrated  Shades of Grey BR we better get Unrated Mad Max

Onto my Negative Bashing of the American General Population why on earth did this film get beat out by Pitch Perfect 2  at the box office
Jesus where are all the Alpha Male Jack-offs who'll throw $100 for a stupid UFC PPV but, you can't get behind ""R"" Rated  Mad Max 3-D Film
What your wives won't give you the keys to your Station wagon so many phonies!
I swear to God Nothing against  Pitch Perfect 2 but, that Film wasn't made for the theater and somehow it took Number #1 at the American Box Office
Over all Please for the love of God get behind and support this film it's a Rare Film in 2015
It's Rated 'R' it's for adults and It Don't have product placement in it.... You don't see Max driving a High End 2015 Import,  Furiosa  isn't wearing beats headphones, and you never see a can of Dr. Pepper anywhere
and it's a Real throwback to a different time when Films were made for Adults and didn't talk down to you and mock you
It's 2hr of B@lls to the wall Action and it don't apologize for what it is
And don't Trust anyone who is giving this film 1-2star Reviews they are just Trolling (They Never saw this flick or they are angry Teenagers who couldn't get Mommy to take them to a rated 'R' Flick
There is Nothing like this action Flick It needs to be support and make some money
Tom Hardy has signed onto doing 3 more films (But, Hollywood can buy out contracts and just Stop at this film)
Lionsgate did this with Chainsaw 3-D
I prey this film isn't the last of it's kind.  When I walked out of the theater I had Both Hope & Fear  (Hope 'Cause this is such a  Ambitions  Film that does so much so right)
Fear 'Cause  George Miller is 70yrs old and this could be his last shot at doing films ""his"" way and Studios hate people like George Miller I love films I respect The underdog that does things there way.  I just have this bad feeling this will be the Last Film like this I'll ever see at a Theater again and it's heartbreaking",1432166400,11,7472,4.293950177935943
7231868,2,B00YQJRYGY,"This I have to say was a super weak plot and poorly done in my opinion.  There is a lot of action but it is almost like this movie was just thrown together as they were filming...  It is certainly an interesting change compared to the original, but fall flat.
It was poorly directed I feel and just too much funky type video.  It does remind me similar of beyond thunderdom but it is just setting up a for part 2 that's all.  Even if I watched this at our ""dollar"" theatre I would have felt kind of ripped off.
I would not recommend it to anyone.",1432166400,9,546,4.074766355140187
7231869,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road takes the concept of Mad Max and improves upon it 1000%! This film is not only a great action film (with mostly practical effects and stunts), but it's also a great /story/, as well as an excellent feminist film (a welcome surprise!).",1432166400,3,253,4.521739130434782
7231870,3,B00YQJRYGY,"I'm a huge fan of the first two Mad Max movies and viewed both of them in anticipation of going to see ""Fury Road."" Unfortunately, it wasn't the experience I'd hoped it would be.

Here's the scoop. Max gets captured by some thugs and given a glimpse of their stronghold overseen by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his minions. He oversees a huge population and keeps them in line by meting out small amounts of water and food. He also keeps a cache of young women, known as ""breeders."" herein lies the rub. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) Is supposed to be on a fuel run. She is, in fact, spiriting away the breeders so they can find a better life. She and Max become unlikely allies.

On the good side is the excess. This is so over the top you can't see the top. All the costumes, cars, weapons, etc. are a visual feast. You don't believe it but it's still really cool. The action is unbelievable. At the conceptual level it's remarkable. On the execution level it's even more remarkable. You simply cannot believe what you're seeing. Some stunts seem actual, some must have been CG but the blend is seamless so it's impossible to tell the difference.

On the downside is the story. It's pretty thin. Just enough outline to get you from one action scene to the next. Then there's the Max character. I'm not certain why Tom Hardy took the gig. They try to couch his wanting to help the women in terms of redemption for people he tried but failed to help in the past. It's too vague and carries no emotional punch. Max has way too few lines so there is a hole where Max should be.

That being said, this is still a heck of a watch. It's as exciting a movie as you are likely to see and, for my dollar, is better the ""Beyond Thunderdome."" It's probably better than the three stars I gave it but shy of four. If you're a fan, indulge yourself. If not......",1432166400,8,1862,4.372832369942197
7231871,5,B00YQJRYGY,"This film is an epic action film with dozens of intelligent and artistic flourishes. Though it is the fourth entry in this franchise, the film feels wholly original and unique. The adage of they just don't make em like they used to is quite true in this case. As a $200-million R-rated production that looks headed for middling box office returns, this film is both a revelation in the modern era of moviemaking and maybe the last of its kind. Future iterations of a similar movie will likely be a more sanitized PG-13 with a much simpler (dumber) story to draw in that wider, younger, international audience. So smart moviegoers will catch this rare film while they can.

One of the hallmarks of great science-fiction is a lack of overt exposition. Trusting its viewers to not be complete morons, good scifi can just submerge the viewer in medias res and hit the ground running in a new world without sweating the insignificant details of how and why everything works. While there is a brief intro voiceover at the beginning, the rest of the film beautifully surprises the viewer with its oddball universe by just instantly introducing the strange culture, characters and technology in this stunningly original take on the post-apocalyptic wasteland. A variety of characters even speak a newly-invented gear-reverent slang to great effect.

While the film is ostensibly on the surface about people fighting each other with cars, there are a plethora of deeper themes and ideas decorating the otherwise straightforward narrative. From examinations of faith, leadership, ecology, death and morality, the film is also surprisingly progressive in its design. While on one hand the film is a nostalgic throwback to macho-80s action fests, it is also lightyears ahead of other contemporary action films in its powerful depiction of women (see Black Widow in Avengers 2), where the female heroines often outshine the main man with their burly strength and gutsy power. Something Ive not seen discussed elsewhere is the very respectable presentation of the elderly in this film too. While casual ageism easily plagues other films to knock old people as cheap targets, this movie features a host of lunatic seniors who are all stone-cold killers, fighting for both the forces of good and evil.

If theres any little thing to knock here, then its a pair of small but clunky conversations with awkwardly announced motives, though the writing and dialog are always superior elsewhere. And perhaps lead actor Hardy couldve injected a little more charismatic levity and breezy charm into his role beyond being a solemn and ruthless survivor. But from co-lead Theron, down through the eclectic supporting cast, to the brilliantly vicious Darth Bane bad guy, the acting is all quite superb, especially given how this film demands varied emotions of intensity, fear, rage, tragedy and/or pitch-black humor at any given point.

While the many unexpectedly good elements of the film are easy to tout, its merciless action is still the magnificent heart of this masterpiece. The spectacular sequences are particularly special in two regards:

1) The film is a triumph for old-fashioned practical effects, meaning makeup, set design, functional vehicles and insane stunts all employed over ubiquitous CGI. Certainly some of the epic vistas in the background employ some computer modeling, but the eyes are still amazed by the realism of actual people with spiked Mohawks leaping between turbo-charged vehicles.

2) The pace of this film is as relentless as can be. Fittingly described as a two-hour car chase, even the slower parts are still imbued with a constant sense of tension to propel the story forward. But with scene after scene of nonstop fistfights, shootouts and car chases  often all occurring at the same time  only the faint of heart will gripe about this movie having too much action.

I cant believe that the usually snooty critics agree too, but Mad Max 4 is a punk-rock, post-apocalypse, avant-garde masterpiece of violence, insanity and unabashed fun. It is an instant all-time classic. Whether it becomes a niche cult favorite or a universally beloved film remains to be seen.",1432166400,13,4177,5.1039531478770135

Rarely does a minute go by without explosions or some other type of physical violence. There is little to no explanation for characters actions or motivations. You just understand that the strong bully the weak because they can and that is enough. Too much backstory would make the movie to long and change pace. That being said I love this movie. This is the ""Gone With the Wind"" of action movies. I believe it takes as much talent to make a good drama as it does to choreograph a great action flick . You can really feel the hopelessness in the landscape and then there is the wind/electrical storm complete with tornadoes. Yes the camera work is a feast for the eyes and senses. It was hard for me to follow the action in some of the quick cuts but overall I quickly forgot about comprehending what I just saw and moved onto what was happening at that moment. I can worry about what I missed when this is released for home viewing. I know I will purchase this and strongly recommend seeing this on the big screen. The only reason I can think of not to see this movie is if you really have a problem with violence in cinema, but other than that, it's all good!",1432080000,8,1327,4.376518218623482
7231875,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Pros: great special effects, lots of explosions, good vision trying to portray a futuristic post-apocalyptic world
Cons: extremely weak story line (I can't overstate how weak it is), almost no dialogue, uninteresting one-dimensional characters.  It's called Mad Max but the main character is definitely not Max.  Even the movie cover emphasizes the Furiosa character.

Summary (no spoilers)- Pretty much everyone loves the fourth of July firework display that comes around every year.  They especially love the finale.  Here's the thing though- if you saw a 2-hour long firework finale you'd get pretty bored about 15 minutes into it.  That's exactly how I feel about this movie.  There is such enormous potential for this to be a great movie but the complete and utter lack of story just makes this a 2-hour series of explosions that can quickly numb you to any feeling of excitement or interest.  This is supposed to be a fun action movie so I'm not trying to say I want an award winning drama.  But seriously, a little bit of story in the beginning to set the stage would have been nice - or even maybe a breather every so often for the characters to reveal any type of back story or personal motive.  The first question anyone asks about a movie is usually ""what's is about?""  The only response to that question here is ""stuff blows up.""  I'm not going to say don't see this, but lower your expectations to a 1-star movie.  Then you might be pleasantly surprised.",1432080000,9,1467,4.75098814229249

Sure, there isn't much for character development or much by way of story, at least not the conventional variety that movies usually contain...but it was still there, just a bit differently conveyed and with a strange sort of (I'm loathe to use the word in reference to this movie, simply because it sounds absurd)...subtlety. The plot is propelled in a very visceral way, with the explosive momentum of the action itself as the vessel...and good lord was that intense.
This movie took the tension and action from Max Max, The Road Warrior, and Beyond Thunderdome, rolled it all into one beautifully executed package, and made it far more epic than the previous films could have been. This was the movie I spent more than a decade waiting on, from the first time George Miller began discussing his plans for Fury Road (only to have it put on what appeared, at the time, to be a permanent hiatus), and it was worth the wait.
As much as I wanted to see Mel Gibson reprise his role, Tom Hardy handled it with the sort of professional capability that made it easy to deal with while experiencing the final product. Hell, there were even scenes where he was almost indistinguishable in the role from Road Warrior era Gibson. Charlize Theron was fantastic in what amounted to the leading role of the movie, but Theron being great comes as no surprise to anyone, I would imagine. She always is. Of course, we can't forget the absolute perfection of continuing the Farscape correlation, at least those of us who were fans of Farscape. Melissa Jaffer (who played Utu-Noranti Pralatong) plays Keeper of the Seeds in Fury Road just as Virginia Hey (who played Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan) portrayed ""Warrior Woman"" in The Road Warrior.
And then there's also the fact that Hugh Keays-Byrne (who played Toecutter in Mad Max) once again portrayed Max's major antagonist by portraying Immortan Joe in Fury Road.
Little things like that really do make me happy.
I'm not going to deny that there are probably numerous flaws with the movie beyond the miniscule ones that I noticed, but I couldn't conceivably care less...the whole was strong enough to compensate for any shortcomings in the components. Admittedly, I'm a Mad Max fanboy. I'm one of those people who sincerely feels that original trilogy of films stands just as strong as movies like The Terminator, and the other movies from the same time period that are considered to be classics by many. My opinion is, of course, a bit biased in that respect...but not that biased.
It was fun, it was intense, it was jaw-droppingly spectacular where the effects were concerned, the cinematography was actually beautiful in a lot of respects, the acting was solid and consistent throughout, and Miller's directing was superb. This one is worth seeing on the big screen, as many times as you can manage it, in 3D if you can manage it (it takes advantage of the 3D better than a lot of movies do).
So, get going!",1431993600,3,3071,4.720670391061453

 I've just returned from seeing ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". I'm a Mad Max maven from the first movie (which wasn't very good), on to the last previous (Thunderdome, which was better) with ""The Road Warrior"" in between (the best, up until now). This is ""Road Warrior"" on steroids. The action never stops. The vehicles are outlandish and unbelievably malevolent. The chief bad guy is - though you'd never be able to make it out unless you were told - the original bad guy, from the first movie, the Toecutter. Through the years he seemingly has sucked up enough gene-altering toxins from the fall of the world-as-we-know-it to produce creepy, doomed offspring with physical, mental, and emotional issues of their own. Max, interestingly, has not aged at all - permanently 30-something, and just as nuts as before. Charlize Theron, in a grubby, grimy, post-apocalyptic way, presents a little macho-female charm, while being the deadliest one-armed broad on the planet. George Miller, the director for all the movies, hasn't slowed down at all from his vision for the franchise, and at 70 has produced a thrill ride worthy of the name. A great deal of it resembles the second movie, but it's a shout-out at best; ""Fury Road"" pulls out all the stops, and makes ""Road Warrior"" look relatively tame by comparison. And what humor he interjected into ""Thunderdome"" (there was quite a lot, actually) is gone from this movie. I didn't find anything amusing at all, but it sure was involving; and you're so busy trying to keep up, it's difficult to home in on any one thing. The one mildly humorous line in the movie (and, to set that up: Max has gotten in the middle of a plot to spirit away The Toecutter's stable of beautiful wives, his ""breeding stock"", as it were - though how these lovely ladies evolved from the general populace is a mystery) is one of the Chief Baddie's soldiers, observing the mayhem, and remarking, ""All this over a family squabble.""

If you really like action movies, well, it doesn't get any more action than this.",1431993600,5,2065,4.7465181058495824
7231878,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Folks, lets just start by stating the obvious.  When in your life will you again have the chance to see a $150 million budgeted R-rated action movie?  Probably never.  So go see this in theaters while you still can.

Fury Road is an intensely action-gasmic spectacle.  The first 30 minutes bombarded the audience with an unmatched extreme action sequence (and an equally magnificent battle score) beginning with a post-apocalyptic high speed car chase, Max is captured by tribal cultish goons and then escapes giving chase through a subterranean quasi-steampunk lair while still fettered and gagged while battling dozens of these minions while climbing and hanging from things and trudging through water, and then we get another tremendous mass vehicle chase/battle scene littered with explosions and speeding dilapidated car wrecking cartwheels and minions climbing all over these vehicles like ticks on mechanized apocalypse cattleand then it all continues in a sandstorm with more bodies being flung from or even into the paths of raging war machines in the maelstrom.

There may be LOADS of CGI, but the budget shines as brightly as the rich orange explosions and the electric yellow sand.  The cinematography bestows grandiose scale to our vastly empty wasteland populated by chaotically raging traffic.  The action was truly flawless throughout, ever-tense and utterly thrilling, and often catches you off guard with the sheer brutality.

George Miller (Mad Max, Road Warrior, Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome) hasn't done very much recentlyreally only making childrens movies like two Happy Feet films and Babe: Pig in the Big City in the last 20 years.  But after making happy-go-lucky bright-eyed, bushy-tailed kids flicks he has returned to Mad Max with a most fierce yet equally welcome assault on the senses.  We have not 2 minutes of calm as we meet Max, his two-headed gecko snack, and his dusty Ford Falcon XB GT.  From that moment on we are graced with a score that matches the scale of the scenery, the explosions and the budget.  Its grandiose in the best of ways; I truly lost myself in it.  By the way, the acting was also great!

As Max, Tom Hardy (Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises) is perhaps perfect, but his character is quite unexpectedly understated.  His lines are few and he isn't really the hero of this story.  Rather he is a reluctant sort-of nomad-turned-antihero who trusts no one and remains nameless through the majority of the film.  The real hero is Imperator Furiosa (daringly performed by Charlize Theron; Prometheus, Snow White and the Huntsman), a once-loyal servant with a mechanical arm who is defying Immortan Joe by fleeing his citadel with his enslaved harem of breeders (a group of young attractive women Joe uses to produce children).  They find unlikely help in a turned minion Nux (Nicholas Hoult; Warm Bodies, Jack the Giant Slayer) and a clan of strong, elderly warrior women deep in the desert.

Our antagonist is the tyrant Immortan Joe, played by the very same actor (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who played the villain Toecutter from Mad Max (1979).  Joe rules by controlling the water supply and motivates his gullible and devoted minions called war boyscovered with almost tribal body modifications like body paint, piercings, ritual scarrings and brandings--with promises of an afterlife in the paradise of Valhalla, and as such they are ready (even excited) to die in battle serving their warlord.  Look for the guy playing the double-necked flamethrower guitar and the gigantic Nathan Jones (611 390lbs; Troy) at Joes side as son Rictus who, along with an army of war boys and heavily modified vehicles, aid Joe in recovering his property (i.e., his breeders).  That, in essence, is the plot.  Max just ends up in the middle of it all.  It may sound overly simple, but it works gloriously.

So who is this movie for?  Anyone who likes action movies.  Really, ANYONE who likes action movies.  Also, anyone who appreciates strong female roles.  Feminine strength and freedom is what drives this movie and the rather simple plot.  Despite the fact that there isn't much to the story, the film is overall AMAZING.",1431993600,6,4155,5.039531478770132
7231879,3,B00YQJRYGY,"In 1985, apparently sending George Miller's Mad Max franchise to the hereafter, Tina Turner sang ""we don't need another hero"". Thirty years later, Miller has had a change of heart. Mad Max is back, with another hero, and she's called Furiosa.

Mad Max: Fury Road is set on a huge featureless, arid, salted, dead plain, 45 years after ""the fall of the world"". We are told ""the future is the road"", yet there don't seem to be any roads; just tracks in the sand. Nor is there water or vegetation, and the only food on offer is one two-headed mutant lizard and an underweight cockroach.

Yet life persists: the desert teems with angry bogans driving monstrous supercharged V8s. What they eat and drink, and where on earth they get refined gasoline half a century after the apocalypse is anyone's guess, but they sure as hell blow through the stuff. Actually, they do tell you: they get it from Gas Town. Munitions - also gleefully expended - hail (ahem) from Bullet Farm, it taking more than nuclear holocaust for Australians to kick their habit of unimaginative place names.

So this tale starts out as a rather grand voyage to go and fill up the car. Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is the tanker driver sent out to get it. She has only one arm, a crew cut and a faraway look in her eyes. Instead of eye-shadow she has smeared her forehead with engine grease.

And she's, like, a woman; seemingly the only one in the Citadel not in some kind of indentured breeding programme. This might lend Mad Max some post-feminist credentials, though what you'd be doing even looking for them in a movie whose conceptual scheme is basically Grand Theft Auto Goes to the Desert is hard to say. It's also moot whether one should bother about logical inconsistencies or continuity errors in a film which is basically predicated on them, but Furiosa's tanker is *already full* of gasoline when she sets off.

As convention dictates, Furiosa goes rogue. She turns east. She has stolen five fecund foxes from under the nose of the Citadel's chief warlord Immortan (sic) Joe. Joe, who wants them as breeders, saddles up his baddest tricked-out bogan desert sleds and a zombie thrash-metal guitarist strapped to a mobile public address system and chases Furiosa and her chicks across the desert for an hour.

I hope you won't consider your experience spoiled if I tell you they then turn around and get chased back, for the remainder of the film's running time.

Now you might have noticed someone missing from the synopsis to date. Isn't this film about a mad bloke called Max? Well; yes and no. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is there, along for the ride. On the way out, literally: strapped to the bonnet of a chasing vehicle like a living figurehead, intravenously feeding his blood to anaemic War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) as he drives it.

Once he unhooks from that, he hooks up with Furiosa and her kidnapped harem, and rides shotgun back, fixing engines, opening stiff jam-jar lids, wasting War Boys, and generally helping out around the house a bit like Schneider used to in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Day-at-a-Time/dp/B00008EYBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Day at a Time</a>. But he doesn't have much to say. Mad Max: Fury Road is no more about Max than it is about a road: in the alternative (surely apocalyptic) universe where this film garnered academy award nominations, Max would only be a supporting actor.

So it is Furiosa, not Max, who is the heart and soul of this two hour marathon of stunts, explosions, noise and truck-bound production design. All that's missing is blood, gore, nudity, bad language and a sense of humour.

And, maybe, Tina Turner.

7231882,5,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was one of the movies of the summer that some experts were predicting would under perform. It has been 30-years since the last movie and the series' star, Mel Gibson, had to take a backseat to a new generation of actors. I doubt it under performs, but if it does it will only be because the modern day moviegoer is clueless about what a good movie is. This is a good movie. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" proves that you can still do crazy over-the-top stuff and still keep things feasible. Too many movie creators have made the decision that moviegoers need ridiculous and even more ridiculous on top of their typical ridiculous in order to be satisfied.  ""Fury Road"", despite it's futuristic, apocalyptic premise and despite the chaos reigns theme, keeps everything grounded and real.  Despite hundreds of characters and hundreds of incidents upon incidents that form its organized chaos, never once does George Miller leave his roots.

Max has to fight to free himself from the grill of a car and then fight to remove the chains from his hands and the arm of another body and then he has to fight to remove the hannibal lecter iron from his face and then he has to find his way forward interacting with numerous diverse characters and figuring out who to trust. Every little detail of what makes these thundering vehicles work and thrive is fleshed out in reality. There's no ridiculous unrealistic parachuting cars here. Every plot progression and developing story is the result of a counter action and a carefully crafted orchestra of chaos. It's quite simply brilliance that can't be described.

The real star of the film though is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a rogue tanker driver who deviates from her delivery plans without explanation and sets off a series of events that leads to a film experience like no other. She's everything that is great about movies these days. Here's this beautiful, stunning tall blonde supermodelish actress who is willing to ugly herself up a bit and get dirty with the big boys; wiping her buzzcut forehead with engine oil and fighting tooth and nail despite her one mechanical arm. Not only that she delivers passion and purpose to the chaos, giving credibility to everything that happens throughout.

""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is a dazzling collection of incidents that barely lets up. Some movies would be criticized for such audacity but George Miller made everything work with such intricate detail you don't question it one bit, you just ride along with eyes wide and amazed. Sure there are some moments in the film where character progressions happen way too fast, but that isn't enough to bring the film down. Max and Furiosa relationship cascades too quickly from wanting to kill each other to helping each other and one other relationship later on in the film seems to blossom out of nowhere, but despite that, the movie will take your breath away and even hit you in the heart a few times.

More Directors should treat the action movie genre with the care that George Miller does here. He used his brain and made a brilliant film. He didn't sell out to the over-ridiculous trend that has ruined action movies over the years. He did what he does best; cars. He knows what makes cars tick and he used that knowledge in a feasible fashion. Then he put characters and purpose into the mix and let it all come together like a rock concert that can be watched over and over and over again.",1431907200,4,3449,4.73044925124792
7231883,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Non-Spoiler Theatrical Review for MAD MAX: FURY ROAD.
Saw it yesterday and it was phenomenal. It was everything it should have been very little CGI, tons of real stunts, and over the top characters and lots and lots and lots of bloody ACTION!!!
 Fury Road is every bit as good as the other Mad Max films and its a progression of violence. This is no 300  this is MAD MAX and the carnage and mayhem and madness is back!
 For those too young to have never seen the original Mad Max, Road Warrior and Thunderdome this falls right in line  the only thing missing is Gibson and although I thought that essential element would be sorely missed I realized that what the creator George Miller is doing is the same thing they did with Bond and with Daniel Craig.
 Fury Road is both a continuation and a reboot all at the same time just the same as Casino Royale was. And just as welcome. The wonderful thing about the Max series and why that works so well is because there has never been much dialogue or even story for that matter  Max is ALL about the mayhem and the rage and the action and it has never been more apparent than in the Road Warrior and in Fury Road.
 There are glimpses and shades of the other films in this one but I think its most similar to Road Warrior than any of the others for a sense of pure momentum and a never-ending assault on the senses  Fury Road is pure octane, pure diesel and pure adrenaline from start to finish and a very welcome installment in the Mad Max series.
 Tom Hardy excels as a Gibson replacement  yeah Gibson is missed but the pangs lesson as the thrill ride begins. And I very much hope and look forward to at least two more films in this Max Trilogy. Kids who haven't seen the older films will awe and gape and be amazed at how raw this movie is and I think like Kick-Ass it will very soon reach cult status and legendary status and there will be a fever of wanting to revisit the older films along with the new. As this series progresses it gets every more surreal as well  the post apocalyptic desolate future-world of Max become even more dangerous and weird (shades of Terry Gilliam) and a welcome tension relief to whatever everyday troubles you have  its like a rollercoaster  literally. Sit back, get your popcorn ready, pull on your Crash Helmet and enjoy the ride!!!!
 Like George Lucas who created and oversaw Star Wars for so long George Miller is writer, director, creator of Mad Max but he has NOT lost his touch  if anything its been ramped up  Fast and Furious has octane competition The ORIGINAL Fast and Furious is back!!!!  The Fury is back!!! The Madness is back!!! MAX is back!!!!",1431907200,5,2641,4.368098159509202
7231884,1,B00YQJRYGY,"I am still shaking my head wondering why this is getting the reviews it is getting. I get the cinematography is great, but the story line is completely vacant. It's more or less two hours of a chase scene. Max is a grunting ape. With out a doubt the worst movie I have ever gone to the theater to see.",1431907200,18,301,4.033333333333333
7231885,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Short version:
While Tom Hardy is immediately not as ""good"" as Mel Gibson's Max, your attention will be more on the female lead. While it has plenty of testosterone insanity imagery for guys, it also has a ""we' are not just things"" heroic attitude for the ladies; resulting this film enjoyable for both genders. Containing very little ""calm sections,"" the rest of the movie is one gigantic insane care chase. It's the best Mad Max yet. Literally visual insanity presented on screen, but fun to watch. It's a definite beautiful film that doesn't let anything slog it down.

Obligatory long version.
The positive reviews for this movie do not lie. In fact, I'm going to flat out state that Mad Max: Fury Road IS THE BEST out of all of the Mad Max Films. George Miller, one of the brain child turned veterans of the franchise gloriously returns 30 years later with an installment to reinvigorate the world of Mad Max. If there were any negatives for this film, then its a small list in my opinion.

Dont expect any serious or a super explained story with plot devices out of the wazoo. What weve seen lately with summer blockbuster films like the Superhero genre, there is little to no character development in this entry. Because the real character of this movie, besides Charlize Therons Imperator Furiosa, is the world itself. Its a mad world molded by the post apocalypse and fueled by the gasoline soaked sand. Here, we see a part of Maxs insane world being fleshed out more than he does. Honestly, I was actually content with this. The movie almost immediately slams the foot pedal down and becomes one gigantic car chase. There is maybe 1 or 2 slow or calmer sections for the audiences benefit. But as soon as you hear the drums of Immortan Joes war party, its once again all cylinders roaring. This is a popcorn movie holding nothing back and keeping you entertained throughout. While it does have an R rating, I was actually surprised by the lack of , vulgar language (I seriously didn't notice any) and gore. A very rare achievement nowadays.

Onto the title character, Mad Max Rocktanasky in this entry can feel he's just a backdrop to this film. People who were wanting another typical revenge tale of Max pursuing injustice in his trademarked interceptor, you will be disappointed. Tom Hardy portrays, in my opinion a little too gruff and subtle compared to Mel Gibsons infamous role. Im not the biggest Gibson fan (especially for the last couple of years) but Ill admit that Hardys performance literally diminishes in comparison. Going back to the real star of this entry, Theron's Furiosa is honestly my now favorite role of hers. She lives up to her characters name by committing 100% to the character that has to get the job done no matter what. Another key star to the film are quite literally the vehicles. As if Miller conjured up child like to heavy metal inspiration for each, they are a treat to see in action. About 90% of the special effects shots in this film are practical using literally Cirque du Soleil stunt performers.

Mad Max Fury Road was 100% worth the wait. Its a spiritual successor to the Road Warrior that takes the best part of that movie and turning the volume up to 11. Me stating this movie is a triumph for George Miller returning to fan boyhood is an understatement with Fury Road; this is his magnum opus of an action movie. Meaning, the film also feels like a self contained story without any need to sequel bait.  Which ultimately makes a worthy stand alone title. Once again this is something VERY rare nowadays.  And no matter what the extremist nay Sayers state about the pro feminist message that soaks the movie, this is a movie FOR ANY SEX. Yes, there are some kick ass women almost over shadowing Maxs heroics. Like 'the Dark Knight,' you WILL remember and quote the villains, like Immortan Joe's warband, than the title character. But that does not mean there is a ton of testosterone imagery within Fury Road. There is literally a guy strapped to a bus load of amp/speaker stacks blaring out metal riffs from a guitar that IS ALSO A FLAMETHROWER.So yes, male audience, you're going to like this too. Just remember, this movie is carrying a theme that we've seen in 'The Road Warrior' and 'Beyond Thunder Dome:' this is the world of Mad Max. He's there to witness the epic insanity and move onto the next wild ride!

Regardless, when you do watch this movie, get a damn good surround sound and high resolution TV for this wild ride. Its definitely a movie worthy of another theater showing. I've already developed anticipation for owning Mad Max: Fury Road on Blu-Ray.  So far, it's my pick for best movie of Summer Blockbuster 2015! Welcome back, Max! We've missed you.",1431907200,3,4724,4.669471153846154
7231886,5,B00YQJRYGY,"I cannot remember the last time I teared up with absolute joy in the theater from the sheer amount of awe-inspiring imagery I was witnessing. As someone who absolutely adores desert apocalypse dystopias and desolate vistas of destruction, this film proved to be not only an amazing sequel, but a perfect example of a modern day desert punk post-apocalyptic movie we deserve. George Miller, the brilliant bastard who at 70 years old is directing desert chaos the likes of which we've never seen, takes everything he created with his Mad Max trilogy and turns it up to 11.

What he had stored in his mind for over 30 years was a relentless, over-saturated, and pulse pounding circus of mayhem that achieves what so many recent action films have not: mindless fun that still has intelligence. Fury Road's story, like the previous films, is very basic, but what gives it life is the execution of the action, characters, and production design. Miller's apocalyptic universe continues to sadistically expand in Fury Road featuring human milk farms, dogmatic kamikaze soldiers, and musical performances atop weaponized vehicles. In short, it's a morbidly beautiful film. Watch Mad Max: Fury Road if you're dying for a movie that is rife with scorching eye-candy visuals and powerhouse action.",1431820800,7,1285,5.090047393364929
7231887,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road

 I imagined the return of Mad Max after a 30 year break in the action as some sort of a massive kill fest with weird bad guys and loads of exploding death machines blasting through the desert.  I got all that, fair enough.  What I didn't see coming was all that color and carnage wrapped up in a $150 million art film of great beauty.  I also didn't see coming a performance of a lifetime by Charlize Theron in a role where her dialog diminished to practically nothing, her character existed only through her expressions, body language and the shear power of her gaze.  In his fourth time out directing a Mad Max movie George Miller goes from the creation of an iconic character to the creation of one of the greatest films in the history of cinema.
 Director Miller has done some remarkable work.  He directed the first Mad Max film in 1980 and both of the sequels, all staring Mel Gibson.  His new take on the character of Max and on how to make the film memorable results in the new, far far better Mad Max: Fury Road.  Miller has honed his skills by making the 1987 The Witches of Eastwick with Jack Nicholson, Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer, a wonderful movie on its own.  He also directed the charming Babe: A Pig in the City, an utterly different kind of film.  His most successful film to date is the animated Happy Feet about penguins.
 Miller hired, in a brilliant move, Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale.  The landscape of Nambia where they did a lot of the filming has a beauty familiar to those who have seen some of the many Disneyesque nature films made in that photogenic nation.  John Seale makes every use of the natural beauty to give the film a brightness that usually eludes post apocalyptic movies.
 Miller-I am starting to think of him as 'the genius Miller'-wrote the screen play along with two first time film writers, Nick Lathouris and Brendan McCarthy.  Lathouris actually had an acting role in the first Mad Max movie.  We see Miller listed among the producers, which rounds out his function as writer, director and producer.
 In the sparse dialog of the story we meet people who are never named on screen but do have names in the script.  Immortan Joe is named on screen, the chief evil character played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, an Australian actor of some local fame who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max.  Immortan Joe has five wives whose flight provides the long chase sequence that really makes up the entirety of the film, or close enough to it.  Zoe Kravitz plays Toast the Knowing, a wife.  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley plays another wife, The Splendid Anghard and Courtney Eaton another wife, Cheedo the fragile.  Riley Keough and Abbey Lee play other wives, Capable and The Dag.  All are beautiful in their own way and Abbey Lee as The Dag has a great line.  In a desperate situation she is caught praying.  Praying to whom, she is asked.  Whoever is listening she answers.
 Other interesting character names include Rictus Erectus (played by the scary big Nathan Jones), The People Eater and The Bullet Farmer, all kin folk to Immortan Joe.
 The up and coming busy young Nicholas Hoult hides himself in the role of Nux, an acolyte of Immortan Joe.  His best line-- I never thought I'd do anything so shiny --but see it in context.  Hoult recently played as The Beast in two of the X-Man films and in the Zombie love story Warm Bodies.  He and Charlize Theron will re-unite later in 2015 in Dark Places.
 Tom Hardy (recently as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises) easily fills the big shoes left 30 years ago by Mel Gibson.  Hardy has also appeared in RocknRolla and Inception.
 How does an actress play Imperator Furiosa when the writers give her at best two or three pages of dialog?  Oscar winner Charlize Theron does it with her gaze, with her body language and with the absolutely amazing power and skill of an actress who we and everyone else has ranked at the top of her profession for two decades.  Without the career topping achievement from Theron this film, other strong actors work besides, the wonderful choreography of the intricate stunts (nearly all done by actual stunt people, not CGI) besides, the delicious vitality of the cinematography besides, the genius vision and strong, capable direction by Miller besides, would have gone for naught.  Theron is that important to the film.
 Be warned, this five saw blade (a very rare award) film has a strong R rating for non stop violence, for brief nudity and for loads of disturbing images.  Do not take the kids.  Two hours long the film has a $150 million budget and gathered in $109 million world wide over the opening Friday-Sunday weekend.
 Tom Hardy has agreed to star in three more Mad Max movies.",1431820800,4,4727,4.624249699879952
7231888,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Decades ago, a young and handsome Mel Gibson had his international breakthrough as Mad Max in a post-apocalyptic film trilogy with much desert and violence. The same director now did a fourth Mad Max film. Since Mel is too old now (and a bit of an undesirable), the admirable Tom Hardy became Max. However, as he will surely agree himself, the true emperor of this miraculous sequel is Charlize Theron, as Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed Amazon with lovely short hair and an impressive engine oil make-up.
The film thrives on visual opulence of the dry and dusty kind, with a reddish hue. Most people in it are freaks. Most vehicles in it are improbable monsters. There is little need for plot.

And, yes, I kind of actually did cheat here.
-----
Nine Things About the Movie ""Mad Max: Fury Road""

1. In 1979, Australian director George Miller stunned the world with his ultra-low-budget, dangerously-filmed Mad Max. It spawned two sequels, ending in 1985. While he didn't invent the post-apocalyptic genre of sci-fi, he basically shaped much of how we think of it today. And thirty years after Tina Turner made fun of the raggedy man, we have a new Mad Max film.

The first Mad Max film was his origin story. The other movies, including this one, can be seen as stand-alone films; each has its own story and cast of characters. Fury Road basically takes the vehicle-and-gasoline fetish from The Road Warrior, combines it with the search for Tomorrow-morrowland from Beyond Thunderdome, mixes in a death war cult, and tops it off with an impossibly epic soundtrack from electronica master Junkie XL. Then he cranks it up to 15.

2. In a SUPREMELY rare event, I went to see the film on Saturday night, and then I went to see it again Sunday morning, 16 hours later. I wanted to see if my initial reactions to the film stayed the same, and to see if the movie really was as dense as I suspected. I have decided that Mad Max: Fury Road is not only one of the most visionary films Ive seen in recent memory, its also a masterpiece of nonverbal storytelling.

3. George Miller continues to elaborate on his bizarro world of outlandish characters, the vehicles that defy the category of cars, and a so-obvious-its-hidden smattering of social commentary. Staying true to his roots, over 80% of the stunts and car crashes are real. Computer generated effects were used sparingly, mostly in the backgrounds (and of course, Charlize Therons arm).

4. There is somewhat of a character arc of Max through all the films, but the Max in this film is most like an extension of the Max of The Road Warrior. Hes an extremely traumatized man that runs from everything, a survival instinct in a body. He doesnt talk much, and uses grunts and monosyllables when its sufficient communication.

5. The movie starts with an in-your-face reversal of action hero moments, proceeds to what would be the climax of most action movies, and then adds in three more climaxes. While exciting, it can actually induce a kind of fatigue in the viewer, and you start to miss things.

6. Despite the kinetic frenzy of most of the movie, there is a surprisingly cohesive narrative. It has to be picked up from certain lines (sometimes certain words), and from visual cues in the movie itself, but it is telling a real story. He shows you all the dots, but doesn't connect them for you. If you don't want to piece together the deeper context, then thats your decision (similarly, there are also numerous little references to the earlier films that will be completely missed by people who don't know the original trilogy).

7. One of the most fascinating parts of the film is in its characterization of women. Miller hired feminist writer Eve Ensler (known for her play The Vagina Monologues) as a consultant to help him avoid creating the stereotypical female characters in a movie like this. As a result, the women in this film are much more than just characters - I see them more as various female archetypes in different stages of determining their own agency (the men in the movie are much more one-dimensional than the women). I don't want to call this a feminist action movie because that term has too many meanings, but this movie is a defiantly loud rejection of female norms in dystopian lore.

8. OK, Ill break one of my rules and Ill help you out a little here. Knowing Millers penchant for unusual character names, I paid attention to the names of the Five Wives in the film: The Splendid Angharad, The Dag, Cheedo the Fragile, Toast the Knowing, and Capable. Go ahead and Google a couple of those words. Ill wait. Now pay attention to which wives had those names. This is an example of Miller finding small cracks to place clues as to the subtext of the film, but without bothering to make sure you find them. The women in this movie are perhaps the most varied and empowered of any sci-fi movie ever... but Miller makes absolutely no attempt to make sure you understand that. You have to work for it and decode the movie on your own.

9. Despite all this, the movie is not going to be to everyones taste. If you don't like post-apocalyptic movies in the first place, this one probably won't change your mind.

If you like your action movies safe, silly, and simple, stick with The Avengers and call it a day. Its fine.

But if you need an adult action movie with teeth and claws, where there are no heroes, only choices, with stories that actually mean something, even if its not particularly optimistic, then this savagely sublime piece of art should be seen on as big a screen as possible, at the highest volume possible.",1431820800,13,4962,4.6261363636363635
7231890,5,B00YQJRYGY,"The Mad Max series is finally enjoying a long awaited (30 years!) return to form (or is it?). Fury Road brings our titular hero back into the spotlight where he deserves to be. This time around Mel Gibson has been replaced with fan favorite actor Tom Hardy (Inception, Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises). Not only was Hardy a perfect cast from the aesthetic standpoint (looks very much like a younger Mel Gibson in the movie) but the way he plays the character makes it feel like he's been doing it forever.

The supporting cast was anything but lost in this one. In fact many people will say they stole the show (mostly because of Hardy's more limited role). Theron turns in an excellent performance as the Imperator Furiosa and raises the bar of the female hero almost to the levels of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley from the Alien movies. Nicholas Hoult (Google him) plays someone that hardly resembles him or anything else he's done and does a great job making you feel conflicted about his character Nux.

Chaotic and brutal, those are the two most defining words to describe this movie. The action in this film is so intense and so constant the minutes in between scenes where it slows down (albeit with an uneasy tension) are just enough for you to catch your breath. Don't be fooled by the extravagantly improbable scenes. Most of which you see in this film was ACTUALLY done (not CGI). Many, if not all of the race scenes are all done with professional drivers and stunt people, making the movie just that much more incredible

George Miller (who also directed the first 3 movies) returns to re-create his dry and desolate world and fill it with vile villains and heroic heroes.

Every single actor does a fantastic job in the film, but for me the show stealer was Nicholas Hult who I hope receives the credit he deserves for his job because he brought so much humanity and humor to the film. Tom Hardy's performance is different than Mel Gibson's performance as the title role, but ultimately it doesn't even matter because the film is just so exciting. To be honest the film is perfect insanity and will leave the viewer breathless.

Summed up: If you like action films, this nails it.

I was very skeptical of this film by the trailers, it just looked senseless to me. I usually like action only if it's well done and it has solid meaning to it. But seeing the critics raving for this film was too much to resist.

Shocked, stunned, flat out bewildered. Not because it was an amazing film, it's just that that much action seriously leaves your body drained/pumped at the same time. But the amazing part is that i actually was locked on seriously into every bit of it. It was incredibly executed along with solid performances by the characters. If you compare this action to say... pirates of the Caribbean style silliness, this wins far and away by 10K miles. There's no drawn out one on one duels, there is dynamic, all over the place eye candy.

Let's take a step back, because no it's of course not perfect and some will not care for the over-the-top-ness of it all and how ridiculous some of it OK a lot of it is. But that's what this movie is about and achieves. Director Miller is just as much about the art as he is about the execution, so much in the way as say: crouching tiger hidden dragon(loose analogy,stay with me) was about the art within and on top of its fight scenes, MM:FR has an artfulness to it all in the elaborate over the top how/why would these people make such things, kind of way. Now, i'm not entirely sure that i'm not full of crap on all this, but that's what my brain just wrote and believes at the moment. The action may have scrambled my circuits.

The plot is simple: the big guy of the post apocalyptic world has his precious things stolen from him, and max gets inadvertently caught in the middle and ends up helping the good guys, er, girls, er, people try and escape capture. Yea, nothing complex, but it's well written and little nuggets of plot points get dished out at just the right times to keep our interest piqued in between the nearly nonstop car chasing.

Hardy as Max was great, i don't know if he aimed to mirror Gibson's original Max, but i easily saw congruence but with Hardy's own signature.. Charlize Theron's character was really the driver of the film (yea pun...) And she's fantastic as usual.

I also love the well placed and mostly very dry humor here and there. It's not joke humor, it's not silly humor, it's just observational humor if that makes sense (if not you'll get it when you see it)

All in all it's real simple: if you like action films, this really is now up there as one of the best in my book.",1431734400,7,2935,4.951219512195122
7231894,2,B00YQJRYGY,Silly remake of Mad Max 2.  Couple years from now nobody will care.  Just noise noise noise  like Thunderball beyond steroids.  no story but we got noise.  Hey if you love Cannibal Corpse dig in.,1431734400,10,195,4.457142857142857
7231895,4,B00YQJRYGY,"As a long time Max fan (watched Road Warrior in theater 10 times), I've been dying to see this revival of Miller's edgy, over-the-top franchise. For the most part it delivered! A visual orgy of explosive action, outrageous vehicles and sexy women. Personally I would've liked to hear a lot more of the thick Australian dialect that in part made the first two Maxes so great. That being said, I loved and highly recommended this movie. Have a lovely day!",1431734400,4,453,4.675
7231896,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Possible spoilers. In the summer of 1982, one of the last drive-in theaters in Northwest Indiana was about to shut down.  It was a beautiful night and what the hell, let's go.  As usual it was a double feature.  I don't remember one of the movies, but the one I do remember was called ""Road Warrior.""  Not expecting much, I was mesmerized by the style and the actor I had never seen before.  It was a film by Australian director George Miller and the star was Mel Gibson.  As it turns out this was actually the second of Miller's film's featuring Mad Max.  The First called just ""Mad Max"" was in limited U. S. release in 1980 and didn't make any waves.  The third film was called ""Beyond Thunderdome.""  It wasn't terrible but had been dumbed down in order to get a PG-13 rating.

Miller, now 70 years old has rebooted the franchise with this magnificent spectacle, featuring Tom Hardy as Max.  While the film stands on its own, logic would suggest it takes place sometime between ""Road Warrior"" and ""Thunderdome.""  It really isn't important.  Miller (co-scripted with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) gets into the action quickly as Max is being chased by a gang of cut-throats.  We see him and his trusty Ford Falcon XB GT eventually get run down and he is captured.  This chase across the barren landscape (filmed in southwest Africa) is only the beginning of many, each more enthralling than the last.

Max is taken to the Citadel headquarters where the community is ruled by a ruthless dictator named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played ""Toecutter"" in the original ""Mad Max"").  He rules over the wretched from a high stone mountain, where he controls the water.  He is aided by pale-skinned boys and young men called ""War Boys"" who believe death will lead them to paradise.  Key to the story is one of Joe's lieutenants named Furiosa (Charlize Theron).  Kidnapped as a young girl she is transformed into a smart, trusted warrior.

As Furiosa leads a mission to get petrol at a nearby plant, she diverts the semi-truck and her minions in another direction.  She has in fact, rescued a handful of young women, ""owned"" by Joe and destined to provide him with children.  They are called ""breeders.""  Women are key elements in the story.  Not only is Furiosa as strong and smart as any man, she has superior leadership skills.  The young women are able to defend themselves when the time comes.  Later in the film, older women find a place with the band heavy on estrogen with a strong dose of adrenaline.

When Joe realizes what has happened he and his tribe are after Furiosa and her girls, one preggers with Joe's baby.  So where is Max?  As wild as this seems, Max has been converted to a literal life-line transfusing blood to a War Boy called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who had been injured earlier.  Not wanting to miss out on the action and a possible Valhalla, he attaches a muzzled Max to the front of his rig and off he goes on the chase.  And it's a wild one.  Max eventually gets his freedom, but he truly must earn it.  In one of the better fight scenes, Max and Furiosa get it on before joining forces against the evil doers.

There are several elements which puts this film in rarefied air of action films.  First, the photography is spectacular, providing a visual element of the expanse of the desert world the people live in.  We see long aerial shots from high above where the distance between the chased and the chasers can be reasonably calculated.  The color and scope is wonderfully elegant in contrast to the violence of the people.  In fact, an argument can be made that the film has many elements of true art.  There are a few scenes where the film blanches to black and white with perhaps a wisp of color in the eyes or a small article.  While the film has no real story to speak of, aside from survival, there is very real character development.  We care about the ladies and even Nux.  Theron is truly remarkable as Furiosa giving one of her best performances.  Dare I say, her best?  Max is a bit of a jerk, but slowly warms to the point where perhaps he and Furiosa can have some semblance of ""redemption"" as he says.

The final chase back through the desert is perhaps the best I've ever seen involving vehicles.  As I understand it, the tricks with the cars and trucks are not CGI created.  Perhaps enhanced.  But the thunder of the vehicles, the booming kettle drums mounted on the back of trucks and the creep playing a fire shooting electric guitar in front of a sea of speakers is a stunning experience.  Once the movie had finished I realized I hadn't had time to even eat my bag of popcorn.  The film score is by Junkie XL and is enhanced by the Dolby Atmos sound in the theater I was in.  See it on the biggest screen you can find.  You won't be sorry.

One of the best movies of the year watched this time in a 3-D version that wasn't an option in theaters.  Surprisingly well done, it was just as good the second time around.  This is a ""go-to"" film from the action genre.  Charlize Theron should be recognized at awards time, but of course she won't.  Great soundtrack adds to the fun.",1431734400,48,5133,4.4935064935064934

7231899,4,B00YQJRYGY,"""Mad Max Fury Road (3D)"" (2915 release; 120 min.) brings another tale in the Mad Max franchise, which started in 1979). As the movie opens, we see Mad Max desperately trying to escape from the bad guys, as the voice over tells us that ""I was reduced to a single instinct: survive!"". But Max is captured. Next we get to know Furiosa, a lady as tough as nails from the first look. She is about to drive a heavily guarded rig to collect oil, but Furiosa changes course, and decides to head east. Why does Furiosa change direction? And what is she hiding on her rig? At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, if you had heard that the movie was in essence one long car chase, you have heard correctly. The story line is secondary at best, in fact it was pretty confusing at the start of the movie to figure out who is who, but in no time it comes down to ""the good guys vs. the baddies"". Second, let's cut straight to the chase here: are the car chasing sequences worth it? You betcha! It simply blew me away, and just when you think it can't get any crazier, it does! As can be expected, the final sequence (covering the last 20-25 min.) is of course the best. Third, Charlize Theron steals the movie with her performance as Furiosa, reducing Mad Max (played by Tom hardy) to a  sidekick in his own franchise. It is unfair to Hardy, as Theron would've blown anyone else playing Mad Max away. Fourth, the score, composed by Junkie XL, is robust and matches the movie perfect. Last but not least, if  you are wondering whether it is worth the extra money to see it in 3D, my answer is ""probably not"". This is the first movie I went to see in 3D in forever, and the 3D effects weren't all that impressive.

Having seen the trailer a number of times, I had been looking forward to seeing this for quite some time. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended nicely (but by no means was sold out). Given the lofty expectations that this movie has induced in many, ""Mad Max Fury Road"" comes through very nicely. Forget about the story line, just enjoy the action sequences and the commanding performance by Charlize Theron. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1431734400,3,2321,4.378190255220417
7231900,3,B00YQJRYGY,"Welcome to the 2015 summer blockbuster season where science fiction and superhero films dominate the urban sea. Big screens light up with flashy CGI and flashier heroes, anti-heroes, and villains; all supported by a maddening crowd of quirky side-kick characters and excitable extras. Enter the post-apocalyptic realm of Mad Max: a quintessential 1980s franchise updated to 2015 standards. The idea of Mad Max as a rogue anti-hero wandering the desert wastes germinates in the mind of director George Miller. Miller and the rest of the developed world saw the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s as a potential point for global meltdown (war, nukes, etc.); and from this crisis Mad Max emerges. In Mad Max: Fury Road, Miller guides a renaissance using skilled cinematography (i.e. camera positions, etc.) to tell his furious road warrior movie. In an recent interview, Miller explained he desired to make Mad Max: Fury Road as a film that would not need subtitles because visuals tell the story, which it does very well. The characters are purposely under-developed and that understandably proves frustrating to viewers and hurts the film. Miller probably relied too heavily on past generations memories of the 1980s storyline, which is a mistake if a true ""renaissance"" of Mad Max is to occur. The actors are very well chosen and realize Miller's production splendidly; Charlize Theron basically owns the show as Furiosa, a female road warrior on a mission of mercy and redemption (a sequel focusing on Furiosa is reportedly in the works). There is an interesting feminist vibe throughout the film as viewers will note; Max, played stoically well by Tom Hardy and a un-recognizable Nicholas Hoult seem to just be tagging along for the ride. The Hoult character Nux contains an interesting storyline of a fanatic who cannot wait to die for cause until he finds a cause to live for. Sacrifice is a key theme throughout Mad Max and blood, engines, sand, gas, grease, and guns are the audience's vehicles in one wild ride.",1431734400,5,2031,5.029673590504451

Usually I get a large soda at the theatre and end up leaving and coming back half way through the movie, however this film inspired me to hold it in. Lots of action. The music felt like a little much at some points and i thought furiosa's reaction to the ""green place"" was a little funny.

7231903,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Over the last few days you may have heard a bubbling up from the pits of Hell, a poisonous cloud emanating from certain manly men angry over George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. Not because they had to wait 30 years for the film, which would be an understandable reason to be mildly perturbed. But they're upset because the film really centers on Imperator Furiosa, a bald-headed badass woman played with grit and steel by Charlize Theron. Tom Hardy is there, too, but really this is her film. Well, according to these men, who have decided to boycott the film, Miller has destroyed the entire Mad Max mythos by inserting some kind of feminist agenda. Let's be clear, these dudes are morons, not only because of their misogynistic mindset, but because they're missing out on quite possibly the best action movie in years. There will never be another movie like Mad Max: Fury Road. Period.

That's not to say there won't be copycats, but matching the brazen insanity and blistering, stupefying awesomeness will be damn near impossible.  There's barely a moment when the camera stops moving; it's dizzying, especially when set against the harsh and hot desert landscape. But even when it does stop, the wheels are still in motion. Despite the endless amount of blistering action, Miller somehow takes time to explore larger ideas of motherhood and femininity, things we wouldn't expect in a balls-out blitzkrieg of fire and death.

While Tom Hardy ably fills in for Mel Gibson as the road warrior, Mad Max Rockatansky, make no mistake this is the same character you know and love. Only, perhaps, leaner and meaner than Gibson's version, with Hardy bringing every pound of his muscular intensity to bear. The plot is simple, yet fleshed out enough that we recognize the years Miller put into making this film a reality. He's had more than enough time to consider every detail of this post-apocalyptic wasteland. Max, still haunted by his past, finds himself in the clutches of brutal, masked warlord Immorten Joe, who runs a small city known as Citadel. Joe controls the flow of water, and thus he controls everything and everyone. He's surrounded by an army of loyal followers that look like something out of a carnival freak show, which is fine because Joe is perhaps the most freakish of all. These are psychotic minions  (Nicholas Hoult plays one of them) who feed on 100% pure breast milk and paint themselves in chrome with hopes of dying and being reborn in Valhalla.  His iron grip is shattered when his chief lieutenant, Furiosa, steals a massive war rig and escapes with five of his harem.

This is where things really pick up and never really slow down. Mad Max: Fury Road is a two hour car chase fueled on equal parts testosterone and estrogen. The dust flies, the flames kick, the engines roar...you can feel it rattling in your bones, the heat scorching your hair. Miller's refusal to gloss up the action with CGI may have made this incredibly acrobatic, jaw-dropping production more of a headache, but it was completely worth it. There's an immediacy, a gut realism that computer graphics simply can't match and never will, and with a score ranging from orchestral to thumping tribal drums there is literally something for everybody from a sensory standpoint. Just prepare to have your eyes and ears melted by it, and get ready to fall in love with the maniacal fire-spewing guitarist.

What may be disappointing to some is the relative lack of focus on Max himself. The character has never been wordy but he's downright monosyllabic here, and more of a blank slate than ever. The bulk of the focus is really on Furiosa, a hard-edged woman looking for ""redemption"" by fighting for the rights of five, obviously abused women to live their own lives rather than to give Joe more sons. Played by Zoe Kravitz, supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Courtney Eaton, they give each of these women a different kind of strength that sets them apart. When the group encounters another enclave of female warriors who have chosen a different path than the despotic Joe, the point is very clear: the world would be a more hopeful place if run by women. While this idea isn't explored with the depth it could have been, and arguably none of them are given the time they deserve, this is a film with something on its mind other than blowing stuff up. Buried deep beneath all the sand and smoke is a surprising amount of heart.

It can't be said enough; there will never be another movie like Mad Max: Fury Road, not even if Miller directs it himself. This is a once in a lifetime movie event, but do yourself a favor and see it as many times as you possibly can.",1431648000,8,4691,4.754299754299755
7231904,2,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road showcases a bizarre post-apocalyptic world, and the viewers enjoyment hinges on whether or not they can immerse themselves in it. If one can withstand the ridiculous characters and cheesy plot-points, it just might be a fun time at the movies. But, if you're like me and cant resist cringing when the more silly aspects emerge, this might be one to skip. Instead of imitating the more psychological approach of the 1979 Mad Max, this new take on the story notches things up a bit. Everything is much more exaggerated, providing a considerably larger-scale experience for action hungry movie fans. Dont get me wrong, I can appreciate a good action film when I see one (this one having some pretty dazzling moments), the only problem being that there isn't much substance to back it up.

Were thrown into this insane story focused on two distinct rebels: Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa (played by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron). Living on the furthest reaches of the planet in a bleak desert where humanity has been entirely stripped away, these two are challenged with the duty of restoring order as they're chased by a gang of marauders out to kill them. Its a relatively straight-forward storyline, but one that doesnt translate all that well into this day and age. You can let the odd-ball nature of the original films slide because, well, it was the 80s. But when looking at this updated version, everything seems a tad too silly.

Tom Hardy delivers a compelling performance as Max, but hes surrounded by an empty film thats only fueled by constant fight and chase scenes. The hectic method of storytelling works here and there, but not consistently enough to make this film anything notable. Action enthusiasts may fall in love, but if you're looking for a bit more, this isn't for you.",1431648000,18,1817,4.839228295819936
7231905,4,B00YQJRYGY,"Of course this new Mad Max is waaaay over the top, which is exactly what all the young men in the jam-packed theater came to see. In my opinion George Miller's original 1979 ""Mad Max"" with Mel Gibson is a classic, so it's no surprise that our hero is still a loner, still on the move and still sort of a Lone Ranger.

Once again, Miller is depicting his home ground, so we are back in the Outback (actually Namibia) with its heat, desolation and dust, where gruesome violence is the norm and petroleum is the coin of the realm.

The cast:
  * Charlize Theron (""Hancock"") Furiosa is trying to rescue ""breeders,"" young, leggy, scantily clad women who have been selected to service the leaders. She plans to relocate them to her childhood home and stop their exploitation (mothers' milk is ""gathered"" and distributed to the men).
  * Tom Hardy (""Locke"") Max doesn't admit his name until near the end, even though we in the audience never had any doubt. He's troubled by nightmares which he explains are caused by unresolved issues. (Maybe he doesn't say it exactly that way...) Max is a fierce and resourceful guy.
  * Nicholas Hoult (""Warm Bodies"") We first meet Nux as he is getting a transfusion of blood from captive Max. He is excited about ""going to Valhalla"" (dying for the cause) as he fights for his grotesque leader.
  * Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (""Transformers"") The Splendid Anghard is almost six months pregnant when she flees with Furiosa and her fellow captives. Spoiler alert: Yeah, she goes into labor at the worst possible time....
  * Zo Kravitz (""Insurgent"") Toast the Knowing turns out to be a pretty capable gal and ends up pulling her own weight in the huge melee that results from the ""breeders'"" flight.

Movies these days try to out-gross each other, and not just at the box office: we see hideous characters, outrageous vehicles and LOTS of creative blowie uppie stuff. Even though I've suspended disbelief, I can't help but think ""Traumatic Brain Injury"" as I watch some of these scenes, but I check the audience around me and every young man is riveted by the non-stop action (and the scantily clad females).

Obviously this movie does exactly what it is designed to do and it turned out better than I expected.

This is rated ""R"" so expect 120 looong minutes of post-apocalyptic battle (on moving vehicles) with over-the-top mayhem. You'll see plenty of blood (at one point a gout of blood splashes over the camera lens), hear lots of gunfire from a variety of weapons, and dodge pieces of scrap metal as vehicles explode; but no kisses and no sex. Whew!

By the way, that scrap metal is the only time I felt 3D was used properly, so don't $pend extra for the 3D upgrade!",1431648000,3,2698,4.6723044397463

7231908,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the most delightfully insane, action packed and downright enthralling movies Ive ever seen. A very, very high bar has officially been set for Summer 2015.

The first Mad Max film in thirty years (since 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), it may be surprising to hear that Max himself (portrayed by Tom Hardy, filling the iconic shoulderpads of Mel Gibson) is not the hero of this story.

Instead, the movie is more the tale of Imperator Furiosa, a one-armed, facepainted bad-ass (Charlize Theron). Furiosa is a driver for the War Boys, one of the cults that have taken over the post-apocalyptic desert that is the world. Under the guise of a gasoline collection trip, Furiosa hops in her war rig and seeks to remove the Five Wives  five young queens (read: sex slaves) betrothed to the War Boys leader, the horrific King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne)  from their plight and take them to freedom.

How does Max get involved in this mess? By being in the wrong place at the wrong time. At the beginning of the film, Max (having PTSD visions of poor decisions in his past) is kidnapped by the War Boys, and due to his having a universal donor blood type is quickly strapped to the sickly Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Nux becomes one of the many War Boys sent in pursuit of Furiosa, complete with his personal blood bag (Max) attached by a combination IV-drip and chain.

What follows is one of the most unbelievable action films Ive ever seen. Essentially a two-hour chase sequence, Mad Max: Fury Road is a glorious cacophony of fire, spikes, explosions, wheels, speed and insanity. Full of surreal sights (such as a truck made up of speakers, with a full set of war drums in the back, and a guitarist performing in the front  why YES, the guitar DOES shoot flame), jaw-dropping stunts, and some of the best action choreography ever put to the big screen, Fury Road puts countless films to shame.

And who wouldve thought the source? Director George Miller, now 70 years old, returns to the franchise that made his career after fourteen years of false starts. You may believe that focusing on the Babe and Happy Feet franchises (plus a short-lived trip into doing a Justice League movie, cancelled days before production began) wouldve made Miller soft with age, but here, he drops the mic, essentially asking the rest of the action filmmaking world Can you top this?

Dialogue is relatively sparse through the film, our characters sketched more by their actions than their words, but it works across the board. Seeing Furiosa become an incredible leader is just as effective as seeing Maxs transformation from a distrusting wild dog to a proper hero through the course of the film. Even the Five Wives (portrayed by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zo Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) get subtle arcs of their own, where in other films, youd expect them to be painted with the same brush.

Whats really interesting? For a movie set in a dying world, Mad Max: Fury Road contains amazing life in every frame. You can tell the film was a concept artists dream, with incredible costumes, memorable creatures, horrific versions of humanity and stunning landscapes filling the screen.

Fury Road re-defines the Mad Max franchise for a new generation while setting a new bar for action filmmaking to come. Its art as blockbuster entertainment, and I cant wait to watch it again and again. See it immediately.",1431648000,9,3437,4.798646362098139
7231909,5,B00YQJRYGY,"Ah May. The beginning of warmer weather and much to my excitement, the start of summer movies. And as I look forward to movies like Jurassic World, Southpaw, Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Fantastic Four, and many more, today is a day I will not soon forget. Today was a great day due not only to me being off work, but to the unforgettable experience I had with Mad Max Fury Road.

After becoming prisoner to a group known as the War Boys, we see Max not only being held captive but being a donor of sorts to Nux. Later, we see a lady by the name of Furiosa who is tasked with transporting an enormous truck for collecting gas. All seems to go as planned until Furiosa decides to take a different route, and their Leader Immortan Joe comes to the realization that his companions are missing.

I am a huge fan of the Mad Max series, I even hold Mad Max 2 in regard as one of the best sequels ever. And though it has been many years since the last Mad Max film, Mad Max Fury Road stays true to the series's original roots(while adding some new surprises) and George Miller proves that he still has a gorgeous vision as a director. To start out, actor Tom Hardy stars as Max Rockatansky and I like what he does as the character. Where I see Hardy differs in retrospect to Mel Gibson's  interpretation of Max is that Hardy's Max is a lot more vocal as opposed to Gibson's; Gibson's Max wasn't always as talkative as Hardy's version of Max. Hardy's Max is also equally as cunning and as ruthless as they come which is likable as well. That being said, it is hard for me to choose who I like playing Max more: Gibson or Hardy; honestly I like them both. Nicholas Hoult stars as Nux and I enjoyed his character just as much as I enjoyed actor Hugh Keays-Byrne(see the original Mad Max) starring as the antagonist Immortan Joe. But most impressive throughout the entire movie is Charlize Theron's engaging turn as Furiosa. She kicks an insane amount of butt in Mad Max Fury Road, but her character has a heart and ultimately, Furiosa feels necessary to the drama and progression of the story. Fantastic job by the cast.

You would think that with the movie containing such intense action that it would forget to have a cohesive plot. Impressively, Mad Max Fury Road has a narrative that is easy to follow and is still able to deliver in terms of action. Even more surprisingly, Mad Max Fury Road contains a few quick but tender emotional moments.

In Terms of action, Mad Max Fury Road gets nothing but complete applause and acclaim from me. I was amazed at not only how over-the-top and completely crazy the action was, but how beautifully choreographed the stunts were. And finally, Mad Max Fury Road is an Amazing film due to the acting(especially Charlize Theron), the story, the direction of George Miller, and the action scenes. I would definitely love to see the series go further, and with Tom Hardy being signed on for 3 more sequels, it would appear that Fury Road is not the last we have seen of Max Rockatansky.

I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Once Mad Max Fury Road was over and I left the theater, I could not help but smile and say aloud ""What a lovely day!"" This is seriously the most fun I have had as a moviegoer in quite awhile! And If Mad Max Fury Road is any indication of how well summer movies are going to turn out, then audiences everywhere are in for a joyous time at the movies this summer. I need not go any further than to say GO SEE Mad Max Fury Road because it is without question

A GREAT EXPERIENCE

Rated R

Note: I simply can not continue to thank everyone who reads my reviews for the continued support. It still comes as a surprise just how far I have come; writing mere words of excitement in my very first Amazon review of The Dark Knight Rises, to over two years later allowing my love for entertainment to continue to be shared on Amazon. My passion for film, and providing all of you with a detailed review is why I am still here. And to all that have read my reviews I say, have a great summer and thank you so very much for all the support.",1431648000,6,4123,4.365058670143416

8718792,1,B00YQJRYGY,"This is just Mad Max Fury Road in black and white.  Of course they don't let you know it in the description.  You cannot watch a trailer for this film (as with almost all other pay per view movies on Amazon.com) so I thought it might be a different movie, or a follow up that just didn't make it for release.  So, I rented the movie.  I OWN the original Mad Max Fury Road and loved it, but this is the exact same movie in black and white.  Don't waste your money.
