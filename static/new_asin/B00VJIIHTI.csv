7090708,5,B00VJIIHTI,Tracy is a great workout.  I have several of her DVDs.,1435017600,,54,3.909090909090909
7090709,5,B00VJIIHTI,"I love this workout, and I think that Tracy Anderson is a creative genius.  I wasn't expecting to sweat this much and have so much fun.  I woke up very fatigued and not in the best mood, but after doing this workout for the first time, everything improved. The dance moves are going to take a few times to get, but I like it, because as she says, learning these moves is exercise for your brain, too.  I like her attitude, I like the set, and I even like her clothes.  Now if I could only find out where to get those leggings.  If I had anything to complain about, it would be that the band is awkward for me.  I'm 5'10, and I don't know if that's why I'm having issues, but I'm sure it will get easier with practice.",1433808000,2,717,4.049645390070922
7090710,2,B00VJIIHTI,I have several Tracy Anderson DVD's.  My favorite is the Precision Toning dvd because unlike her other dvds she actually counts reps & cues when changing moves.  I was really excited to get this because from the clip it looked like she would do the same here. Sadly that was not the case. But as I said I have almost all her dvds so I wasn't to surprised.  What my real problem with this dvd is the cardio portions.  Basically lots of messy jumping around. You could basically jump & skip around your living room for 20 mins and you would get the same workout.  And the portion of the dvd with the band was awkward.  The moves were difficult to achieve with the kind of precision that I like to bring to my workouts and I am an avid exerciser. I would suggest you skip this & go for the Precision Toning dvd.,1433808000,22,808,4.214285714285714
7090711,5,B00VJIIHTI,"This combination is a bit different in all Tracy's other videos because it combines a basic cardio workout (easy to follow), a more complicated ""dance-y"" cardio workout (like a short taste of what PopStar, & Cardio Dance I and II are all about), and ends with a 20 minute Mat band workout.  So basically 40 minutes of cardio & 20 minutes toning without having to switch the DVD.  The 2nd dance-y-er combination will take me a few times to get smooth since I'm not super coordinated, but I love the challenge of that.  It took me forever to learn her other longer dance videos but now I can do them and get an AWESOME workout while having a blast, I'm a dancer want-to-be so Tracy's videos may be the closest I ever get!  She coaches/cues through the whole thing in a voice over, I did not see an option to have music without her voice as in some of her other videos. She really gets in her element in the 2nd segment, you can tell it is her zone.  It is the same outdoor background as on Method Express Video. The music is different too (not music on menu, but music of the workout, actual up-beat songs with words) The 1st cardio workout is surprisingly tough, I would not call it a beginner workout - the moves are easy to follow & basic, but it is fast and you work up a good sweat. She does jump a bit usual Tracy style, but you could probably adapt it to be more low impact. The mat work is not super easy either due to the balance factor of many of her moves, but it is not as hard as meta mat work in my opinion. She does some new, unique moves using the bands (even from her Teen Meta videos) so I was not disappointed there.  Overall I love the full cardio/mat work on one DVD, Tracy's awesome, she does seem to have a bit of wardrobe malfunction in first cardio segment but she smiles and adjusts right through the whole thing and the workout doesn't stop, I found it humorous because that would be something that would happen to me on camera I'm sure.  Great workout to replace meta on days I want an alternative & the cardio workouts could be used on their own as meta cardio replacements if I'm short on time and want 20 instead of 30 minutes.",1433721600,20,2156,4.231143552311435
7090712,3,B00VJIIHTI,"I have only done the first Cardio workout, but I can't get past her adjusting her top the whole workout.  I have her Cardio Dance for Beginner's and really like it, but even my husband commented that she was adjusting her tank top every time he came in the room, and he never notices stuff like that!  I'm giving it three stars, because I did work up a really good sweat, but it will be awhile before I reach for this one again.",1433376000,5,428,4.144578313253012
7090713,5,B00VJIIHTI,"Great workout!  I love Tracy's method and I'm always excited when she comes out with something new.  This DVD is great.  The two dance cardio sessions are pretty easy to follow along to- but still challenging and a good workout.  The resistance band is a nice addition, I hope she does more DVDs with the band!",1433289600,5,310,4.482142857142857
7090714,5,B00VJIIHTI,"I have worked out using Tracy Anderson's method for over a year now and I love this new cardio workout she has delivered! There are three 20 minute cardio workouts with one of them focusing more on toning using the included resistance band. Tracy talks you through the dance cardio using voice over. It moves pretty quickly and challenges every part of your body as well as your brain. The first 20 minute workout is more of a basic cardio dance routine but still left me dripping sweat. The second routine is more complicated, but doable. The resistance band toning workout is challenging as well, which I loved. Tracy has you engaging your entire body with each move. I like how she is instructing you using voice over rather than pausing between each move and explaining like other workout DVD's usually do. That means that over time, as you learn the routine, you can mute the TV and play your own music while following along with Tracy's movements. I LOVE this DVD!",1433289600,28,970,4.645348837209302
7090725,5,B00VJIIHTI,Love It!,1476835200,,8,3.5
7090726,4,B00VJIIHTI,Great workout!,1465776000,,14,6.5
7090727,2,B00VJIIHTI,"I wasn't very impressed with this video.. I was under the impression that the 3 workouts would all include band and resistance training, but in fact only the last workout has band training and the first 2 are cardio/dance workouts. I started Tracy Anderson with her Mat Method video, so this video seemed a little lack-lusted and not aggressive enough for me to have a satisfied workout.

For someone who hasn't used Tracy before, this might be a good place to start, but her workouts are amazing and I just didn't feel this video showed her true potential.",1461801600,,557,4.683673469387755
7090728,3,B00VJIIHTI,"This DVD is divided into three workouts. I was looking for a good cardio DVD that would also provide some sculpting benefit. The third workout using the resistance band is a great allover (with butt and thigh emphasis) toner. The first two workouts are HORRIBLE!!!!! Tracy was not on beat with the music which made her fast ""dance"" moves (and I use the term ""dance"" very loosely) even more difficult to follow. Additionally, you might do 8 kicks on the right but only 7 on the left. Very frustrating. I am a fitness instructor and understand how important it is to keep with the beat of the music and ensure that you are doing the same number of repetitions on each side. I gave this DVD three stars ONLY because of the third workout and the resistance band is included.",1461110400,3,770,4.507142857142857
7090729,1,B00VJIIHTI,"I have over 100 workout videos and I just dropped this off at the thrift shop. The music was too soft to be motivational and the dance moves were uninspired. She has great videos, this isn't one of them.",1458345600,4,203,4.230769230769231
7090730,4,B00VJIIHTI,"I have done 2 of the workouts so far. They really work you out, but are a little hard to follow. They get easier each time you do them. They are challenging, which is good.",1454889600,,172,3.942857142857143
7090731,5,B00VJIIHTI,Really good! I recommended it!,1454544000,,30,5.2
7090732,5,B00VJIIHTI,This is a great step up from the beginners cardio DVDs. Love this. Trust in Tracy.,1454112000,,82,4.1875

7090734,1,B00VJIIHTI,"I first heard of Tracy Anderson from a post on Instagram and was intrigued by her workouts done to popular pop and club music with a good beat. Those are the kind of workouts I used to enjoy when I would frequent the gym and received fantastic results because I was enjoying moving with a routine to music I liked. These were the same results I was hoping to achieve at home, so I gave her DVD a try. I was disappointed.
Where do I even begin? I know that because of various reasons they can't use copyrighted music by popular artists, but at the very least I expected music kept to a good beat in the background. I think my husband chanting ""ingst ingst ingst"" probably would have been more effective than the random music they play quietly behind her strange voiceover. Which brings me right to her strange voiceover. What the hell is the point? She doesn't call out the moves or help you learn the routine by breaking it down, she basically talks while you're left struggling to keep up with her erratic movements and guess how many counts this one will be and what's next. While some moves do seem to follow a flow and she does call out some random steps, it does nothing to prepare you. She doesn't even follow the same formula for counts, sometimes it being four others two and others an odd number (?!) unless I'm just so lost by that point that I'm not even counting right. And just as you can almost keep up, she pulls out this crazy routine that emulates a nightmare where you're on a Broadway stage and are expected to keep up with a chorus line going full speed. Probably naked. Oh but don't worry, her voiceover is calling out random dance terminology in the background and at one point even breaks down in laughter because it's hard to talk along with the moves! She can't even talk along with the moves she's doing and hypothetically choreographed but I'm supposed to magically know how to do them too? There's no rhyme or reason to this crazy routine you're not at all prepared to get through so instead of doing movements with proper form and energy you're left scrambling around like a spider on ice. My frustration probably burned more calories than my tangled limbs did. I expected to be inspired by a celebrity trainer who would bring an element of dance to inspire me to have fun while working out, and instead got a vapid sorority girl adjusting her bra and pumping a finger toward the sky. This was the worst workout video I've ever wasted money on, but since I have to give at least one star to leave a review, I guess it was nice that the DVD was packaged with the band that I never even got up to using because I was so turned off during the first two routines. Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time.",1447891200,11,2744,4.403543307086614
7090745,5,B00VJIIHTI,great workout in 20 minutes & the dance cardio is definitely less complicated compared to some of her other dance cardio dvds.,1447113600,,126,4.7727272727272725
7090746,3,B00VJIIHTI,"I usually enjoy all of Tracy's DVDs, but this one felt rushed. The voice over is distracting because even Tracy gets lost explaining what she is doing and where to go. In the first segment, the second song goes for at least a solid 10 minutes and the lyrics repeat over and over and over. I understand these are license-free songs, but more variety would have made it better. The second segment is better: music and choreography. It is challenging and you really have to pay attention but also let go of perfection. This segment is what kept me from giving this 2 stars.
The Sculpt and Tone section (not sure why it is called #1 when this is the only one on this DVD) is also very rushed. I felt like I was rolling around on the floor, getting settled into the move and by the time I got it, she was on to the next. Generally, Tracy doesn't count reps but I don't feel like I was able to get an effective workout with this one. I liked the moves, however, I wish Tracy took more time and effort with the moves for the sake of her viewers and not for the sake of time.

Is this a staple? Nope. I think this could have been an awesome addition to my Tracy collection, but sadly, it felt very rushed for the sake of another DVD for sale.",1447113600,4,1234,4.163179916317992
7090747,4,B00VJIIHTI,"I love love love the Tracy Anderson Method! It is the only workout where you see/feel results super fast; if you put in the work you truly reap the rewards. The cardio is great and pretty easy to follow (if you have worked out with her before you know the moves already, just different sequences which can take a bit to master). I have some hip issues that I've had since birth and found the sculpt section with the band challenging, but definitely felt it (real killer for a current shoulder weakness second time around). Overall another great TAM experience from a true fitness master.",1446595200,6,587,4.6
7090748,5,B00VJIIHTI,Love the new cardio and the new mat video!,1445817600,,42,3.7777777777777777
7090749,3,B00VJIIHTI,"This is no doubt a fun video, but you will not likely sweat or feel tired, unless you haven't worked out in years/ever in your life. Tracy isn't the best at giving directions, probably because she has no idea what she's going to do next and makes up most of the dancing as she goes along. She voices over the few directions she does give, which sound like she did one take at the end of a very long day and couldn't be bothered to watch the  routine all the way through before narrating it. The result is a lot of miscues from narrator Tracy while actual Tracy is doing something different in the video. For example, as the music volume on the video lowers, Tracy tells you to listen to the music and pay attention to it at that point, not realizing you can barely hear it. Another time she tells the viewer/exerciser to lift a knee when she's doing something completely different on screen.

The band part is fun, but too short for it to be considered a real workout. Or, she just moves through exercises too quickly, particularly on the arms section, to give your muscles a good enough workout. If you rewind and replay three times, then you might start to feel the burn. The moves are different though, so it's still fun.

If you're looking to get in shape or break a sweat, look elsewhere.  If you just want to move around a little, then this will serve the purpose.",1444348800,,1370,4.36078431372549
7090750,1,B00VJIIHTI,"This DVD is terrible. First, she does not give any cues. Any talking she does was pre-recorded and is edited in with the workout. She does no talking herself while working out, you just hear her voice. And she sometimes gives cues of the upcoming moves and sometimes she doesn't. Her voice you hear just gives some encouragement while you workout. Unless you have a lot of rhythm, this is very hard to follow (and again there are no cues).  And you would have to do it many times to get the moves memorized. You have to struggle to figure what moves she is doing. The cardio resembles dance. Plus, during most of it all she did was fiddle with and adjust her sports bra, tank top and breasts. It wasn't one or two times, it was constantly.  The slim and sculpt part was all work with the band. This part was pretty good (again, no cues but was easier to follow). The work with the band is the only reason I gave it 1 star.",1442534400,3,922,4.232954545454546
7090751,5,B00VJIIHTI,"Love it... I work three 12 hr shifts as a hospital patient advocate. So this DVD comes in handy on those days when I don't always have the time to do the 30 mins of cardio that tracy anderson recommends. With three complete 20 minute programs to choose from, you feel accomplished afterwards, not cut off... On work days I used to shorten the metamorphasis cardio session by around the same 15-20mins marker and feel like I missed out. Give it a try. It's great for travel too!",1441843200,3,477,4.431818181818182
7090752,5,B00VJIIHTI,"Tracy Anderson can do no wrong in my eyes.  I loved this DVD.  It is a lot of jumping around and you have to learn the routine to really have fun with it.  Once you learn the moves, seriously fun.

She has done more for my body than ANYONE else.  Leaner muscles, no bulk. Sculpting action.  If you follow her plan and make your own playlists - it's success with a side of smiles.",1441238400,7,379,4.054054054054054
7090753,5,B00VJIIHTI,Love TAM!,1440028800,,9,4.0
7090754,5,B00VJIIHTI,"This is a great workout. For those of you who are new to Tracy, give it time!! The routines are challenging but they transform your body fast. We were all new to Tracy at first but stuck with it because it works. If you do this you'll see results. There is a twenty minute simpler routine and another much more complex, fun dance routine. The sculpting with the bands takes balance and strength. I was toppling over the first week but by week three I had it sussed. Great workout and getting amazing results fast.",1439596800,7,513,4.410526315789474
7090775,3,B00VJIIHTI,Not challenging enough for people that are TA regulars. I would pass on this one unless you're beginning and want to try her out!,1439078400,2,129,4.416666666666667
7090776,5,B00VJIIHTI,This video is really good. Tracy Anderson really goes out of her way to keep you doing different things and the background is just so pretty it makes you want to watch and do the video.,1438819200,3,185,4.166666666666667
7090777,5,B00VJIIHTI,I have most of her DVD's and they are all great and this one is no exception!,1438732800,,77,3.588235294117647

7090779,5,B00VJIIHTI,Tracy is a genius! My body is changing daily and this DVD is the perfect addition to the Metamorphisis series! I especially like the band series - you WILL see results,1437868800,3,167,4.419354838709677
7090780,5,B00VJIIHTI,Great prompt service love this new dvd.,1437436800,,39,4.714285714285714
7090781,2,B00VJIIHTI,I do the Tracy Anderson Method on a regular basis so I got this video to mix it up.  I was very disappointed that this video does not give the voice only option like her Method video.  Working out to my playlist but still hearing her voice was a genius option on her part!  Why wouldn't she include that option with her latest video??  The sculpt / band portion doesn't really give me a work out because I'm to busy trying to figure out the poses..maybe I just need more practice. Overall as a Tracy Anderson fan I was a bit disappointed with this video.,1437436800,,554,4.247619047619048
7090782,5,B00VJIIHTI,"Please know I haven't done the band toning part of this DVD- so my review is geared towards the first dance section, which is amazing!
I have meta and the dance cardio DVD is too much jumping- this is a great mix of jumping and lower impact. It is only 20 minutes, but I sweat a ton & feel like that is a good amount of cardio for me. It is the freestyle dance - so no combinations to learn. I make a playlist and go at it!
The second dance cardio section is more of a routine to learn, not my taste, but if you like to learn steps it looks fun. I would buy this just for that first dance cardio section, my favorite of all her dance cardio DVDs so far!!",1436832000,9,654,3.888059701492537
7090783,1,B00VJIIHTI,"Horrific!  TA would be fired from your local YMCA.  Verbal cues - none or late (after she's already done the movement)  A torn meniscus waiting to happen.  I am a dancer and yoga instructor, so I have above average body awareness and still felt lost.  What a waste.",1436572800,5,265,4.4375
7090784,3,B00VJIIHTI,I really want to do her workouts but she lacks good instructions. First cardio is good but second cardio is very complex. It is really not easy to go along with her on the second one. She could have at least one introduction part. I never give up DVD's but i had to stop on the second one because it was not possible to follow her..I think her fast pace cardio would be really effective if we could do it,1436572800,,404,4.0625
7090805,1,B00VJIIHTI,"I returned this workout! It was very difficult to follow. There is no cueing to speak of ...there is voice over cueing, but not very helpful.",1436572800,2,141,4.461538461538462
7090806,5,B00VJIIHTI,Great workout for days your are short of time. Covers everything. Short but do not let fool you. It is mighty. You will feel it TV everywhere.,1436400000,,142,4.296296296296297
7090807,5,B00VJIIHTI,"For the price, this is really worthwhile to have in your Tracy DVD collection. The cardio is similar to a level 1 or 2 metamorphisis. The band work isn't so complicated that you can't do it the first time, but will continue to be an effort the better you get and the more you can focus on form. The resistance of the band that's included provides a really good workout.

With notes to production, you don't need to play audio. Just mute and add your own playlist. Tracy always films unedited, so if she makes a face or needs to straighten her top, that's what you're going to get. I prefer it as it feels more natural and fun, like being in a group fitness class.",1436400000,3,663,4.261904761904762
7090808,2,B00VJIIHTI,Not the best Tracy Anderson video. I agree with an earlier review that says she kept adjusting her top thru out the workout. It was distracting. Why didn't she check how her clothing fit prior to taping her video?  Not only that I thought her breasts were bouncing all over the place. The cardio sessions are alright. I need more direction. The second session is almost impossible for me to follow along with but maybe I just need to keep practicing. I do like the 3rd session with the resistance band. It's a nice quick workout if you want something different that's not too strenuous.,1436313600,5,586,4.580952380952381
7090809,2,B00VJIIHTI,"For some reason I thought I'd give Tracy Anderson a shot and decided to buy this newer release from her. I put it in and almost immediately knew this was not for me. First of all, she stumbles through her intro, which is a really bad first impression. Then she delves into the first cardio workout without ANY sort of instruction, other than, ""imagine this is like a video game, just try to copy what I'm doing"". What kind of instruction is that? I was down to try some danced based cardio, but without any kind of instruction on the moves, form, or what muscles I should be working, I started to get the feeling that perhaps Tracy Anderson does not know what she's doing. I didn't try to do the section with the exercise band, but I didn't want to take any chances on doing any sort of exercises under the instruction of someone who obviously doesn't know what they are talking about. I'll admit, I fell for the marketing on this one. There are a lot of better trainers out there with some good, focused DVD workouts. Maybe look into Cathe Friedrich's newer stuff, or Sylwia Weisenberg's Tonique. I also recently bought a Suzanne Bowen BarreAmped Boot Camp DVD that turned out be a great workout.",1436227200,,1197,4.495412844036697
7090810,4,B00VJIIHTI,"Oh Tracy Anderson, you're getting better at it, but the voice-over narration overlaid on the workout and the suggestion that we pretend it's DDR and try to keep up ... perhaps there are better solutions. I appreciate the effort, though. What we're still having trouble with is: 1) introducing the moves; 2) setting and maintaining a consistent rhythm (4/4 or 3/3, not 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4); and 3) helping us transition between moves using vocal queues so we don't have to be watching the screen -- especially at those times when the moves require us to look away, such as forward bends. The voice-over didn't mediate those issues, but again, you are getting better. Maybe watch some Kathy Smith DVDs and notice how she introduces moves, regulates rhythm, and verbally prepares viewers for transitions. That said, I do enjoy these workouts. The music is good, the moves are fun and effective, and I think it's funny watching Tracy make faces at people off camera when she has a flub. Tracy also has some good guidance for how to exercise, how to use the body, and how to think about the workout. I could just use more guidance and more verbal queues.",1436227200,15,1149,4.637254901960785
7090811,5,B00VJIIHTI,My girlfriend is addicted to Tracy and this DVD is another great addition to her collection. The rubber band that comes along with it is also good quality. Great buy!,1435968000,,166,4.566666666666666
7090812,2,B00VJIIHTI,WORKOUTS MOVE WAY TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY INSTRUCTION & THE BAND SMELLS TERRIBLE - DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE USING THIS.,1435536000,,117,4.9
7090813,4,B00VJIIHTI,"This DVD is more difficult to learn the moves if you are not already doing Tracy's workouts.  I have been doing Tracy sporadically for years, so I recognized some of the moves.  There are three 20 minute workouts.  The first one is cardio and it is pretty hard, but I could follow along no problem. I thought it was challenging but I loved being able to mix up my cardio with her other cardio DVD's. When it came time to do the second workout, I had a hard time following along.  I am not a dancer or anything but I had to just bounce around a lot of the time to get my workout in.  The moves were difficult, but I am sure I could learn them in time - I have only done it once!  The final workout isn't really cardio, it is more of like her mat workouts but taken up a notch - all of the regular mat work you are used to if you do Tracy's program, but with a resistance band that really kicked my butt!  I have not done any resistance band work using Tracy's program and I am literally sore ALL over from doing it yesterday.  I love that because I know I will get results!",1435536000,5,1072,4.0
7090814,3,B00VJIIHTI,"I have never done a Tracey Anderson woekout before.  I honestly just needed a band and this DVD came with one so I figured, why not?  I always like to have additional cardio workouts I can do.  I was a little disappointed while doing this because it felt like Tracey was just making up random moves on the fly and the cueing was not real great.  She cues the move after you start doing it - and I don't understand why because it's all done by voice-over.  I prefer to be warned before changing moves.  The actual workout was kind of fun but I would also have liked the music mixed up a bit.",1435449600,,590,4.131578947368421
8710309,4,B00VJIIHTI,Super distracting when her boobs completely fall out of her sports bra in the first cardio segment but it kept me laughing.  Shes constantly adjusting her bra.  Overall I like the intensity of these cardio workouts. Tracy is fun and I find it challenging.  Wish she taught more exercises with the band in this dvd.,1517011200,,314,4.672727272727273
8710310,1,B00VJIIHTI,This was not a good video for me.  I could not keep up to her and I need more verbal cues.,1510272000,,90,3.2857142857142856
8710311,1,B00VJIIHTI,Really hated this-the toning part was way too short and the Cardio was typical Tracy/hard to follow and I spent so much time trying to keep up that I gave up-will stick to her Toning workouts as anything labeled Cardio by her makes me feel like a Dancing Gorilla,1509408000,,262,4.36734693877551
8710312,2,B00VJIIHTI,"Purchased this because the reviews indicated the band could be used for Continuity Year 3. Not true. The Year 3 Continuity band is a looped band. This one is not. Further, the routines are not challenging for those who have been practicing the method for a significant time.",1506988800,,274,4.729166666666667
8710313,5,B00VJIIHTI,"This DVD has 3 segments-- 2 are cardio and one is ""mat"" exercises, with the band.
I absolutely love the cardio on this DVD. I find it so much easier to follow and get a real sweat going than some of her other DVDs (ie, ""metamorphosis"" is a real struggle for me.)
The mat stuff with the band is NOT going well. Im 5'8"" and for some of the stuff she does with the band, there is simply not enough band for me to hold on to. In the video I can see that she is holding on to the very, very end of it and I think Tracy is quite a bit smaller than 5'8"". I would love it if the band were 6-8"" longer. I just cant seem to get a grip on it for some of those moves.",1499040000,,655,3.652482269503546
8710314,2,B00VJIIHTI,"I was pretty disappointed in this video. There are three workouts: two cardio and one with a band. The first two were a complete wash. I need my workouts to have three main elements: the moves are not impossible to learn, they match the beat of the music and they are done in a predictable fashion so that you you know how many sets and reps to do. These first two cardio workouts were lacking all of the above. She does a voice-over, so she could very easily, without being winded, explain what she's doing and what's coming up, but she starts off by saying she can't explain every move, so pretend you're playing a video game and just keep up as best you can. Not at all helpful. There is high-energy music going on, but she's only occasionally locked in with the beat. And she never gives you a heads-up on how many of each move to do. You just get the feeling that she's ad libbing as she goes. (I have four kids and I need to be able to learn my workouts and anticipate what's coming in order to get the maximum effect.) I didn't even bother trying the 2nd one once she said there was more choreography and it was even faster paced. The only redeeming thing about this video was the 3rd workout with the band. She still doesn't always lock into the music, but at least there are far fewer moves, and enough repetitions that you can figure out what to do. Plus you can feel the band start to work your muscles immediately, so you know you're getting results. The first two, good luck, because I couldn't keep up at all.",1492473600,,1523,4.291666666666667
8710315,4,B00VJIIHTI,I really like Tracy and looking for something to do for cardio as I use her Matt routine which I really like.  I have done the first and second one and they were fine but the one with the band I am not there yet it is more advanced in my current routine.,1490486400,,254,3.792452830188679
8710316,3,B00VJIIHTI,"I really like Tracy's Bootcamp DVD, but I struggled with this one.  I am not very coordinated when it comes to choreographed dance moves, so that matched with a fast pace and no breakdown of instruction made this a big fail for me.  I'll keep trying it, but it moves to the bottom of the pile for me.",1489968000,3,300,4.155172413793103
8710317,3,B00VJIIHTI,Fast delivery as far as the work out I did not care for it. The mat work out is much better.,1489708800,,92,3.4285714285714284
8710318,2,B00VJIIHTI,"Was anyone else distracted by her constant pulling and adjusting of her bra?
This whole video for a number of reasons was a no. It's going to Goodwill. I do love her cute smiling face inthis one however, so that was nice. But it didn't make up for the content. Didn't like the band at all either. I'll stick to her other workouts",1483747200,,329,4.238095238095238
