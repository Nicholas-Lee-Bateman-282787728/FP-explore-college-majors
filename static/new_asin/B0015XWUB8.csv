My eldest thought the kissing stuff was a little bit much, and while she was OK with it, she said she wasn't sure if she could show it to her friends.",1242604800,2,286,3.9482758620689653
3148551,1,B0015XWUB8,"Watch how these boys act. If you think it'd be funny for your kids to talk to you that way and carry on in such a sexualized manner, buy it for further family study. Few years of your preteens behaving that way really isn't normal, although it's made to look that way with that whole Disnified sheen.

We have kids that age and younger it's virtually the only show they are prohibited from watching. Zach and Cody are bad for kids.",1235865600,,431,4.320987654320987
3148552,5,B0015XWUB8,"When I bought a movie called 'The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things' I thought the Sprouse brothers did an awesome job as Jeremiah, and then I found out about this show. I started watching last week, and now I don't want to stop. I love it! I'm 19 and I watch kids shows, because I'm awesome! If you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Zack and Cody Martin live with their mom at the Tipton hotel. Cody is the smart one. Zack is the one always making trouble. Mr. Moseby is the manager who must put up with their shenanigans. London is the dumb spoiled rich girl who is an heir to the hotel. Maddie is the hot blonde who works in the candy department and often helps with Zack, Cody, and London with their problems. I highly recommend THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY!!!",1235347200,3,776,4.214765100671141

3148556,3,B0015XWUB8,"This DVD contains 4 episodes of the Disney Channel series, ""The Suite Life of Zack & Cody."" The show is set in the Tipton Hotel in Boston. Regular characters include identical twins Zack and Cody (Dylan and Cole Sprouse), hotel heiress London Tipton (Brenda Song), as well as candy counter girl Maddie (Ashley Tisdale), single mother Carey (Kim Rhodes), and the hotel's manager Mr. Mosbey (Phill Lewis). The four episodes featured on this DVD begin with: ""Lip Synchin' In The Rain,"" which has the gang putting on their version of ""High School Musical."" Inside gag is that Ashley Tisdale starred in the actual HSM as Sharpay, however in ""Zack & Cody,"" nobody sees that Maddie looks anything like Sharpay. Even though Maddie is the best singer and dancer, rival London gets the role of Sharpay because her dad is rich. Of course there is a happy ending and the gang works together to make the show a hit. #2 is ""Arwin That Came To Dinner."" Arwin is the hotel repairman/engineer who is distraught that his mother has moved out of the apartment that they share...and Arwin is clearly in his thirties. The twins and their mom help Arwin get over his mom fixation and find true love by converting his apartment into a cool bachelor pad. #3 is ""Orchestra,"" which features a Russian Violin prodigy in the high school orchestra who comes between Cody and his girlfriend Barbra. 1970's blonde bombshell Susan Blakely has a role as the orchestra conductor, Mrs. Madigan. #4 is ""A Tale of Two Houses."" Zack & Cody's dad is back in town due to a play he is performing in. The twins scheme to crash his new apartment with their girlfriends while dad is working, and unbeknownst to them, they pick the same evening. 4 is a definitely a crowd, and even more people decide to drop in.

Extras include ""Twin-Tastic,"" a featurette with the twins getting interviewed by Brenda Song (London), telling what it's like to be twins. No great revelations here, but it's still nice to see how natural the kids are what a nice rapport they have, even off camera. It is also interesting to hear about identical twins...the truths, the myths, and the entertaining stories that the boys share. A gag reel with bloopers and blunders is also included for good measure, as well as a number of Disney sneak Movie and DVD previews.

This show is definitely aimed at kids and teens and is thoroughly enjoyable; lots of physical humor and pratfalls, juvenile humor, and an ensemble cast that plays well together. Although Zack & Cody are obviously going through puberty (and trying to get the girls), there really aren't any scenes that would not be safe for kids to watch.",1213401600,10,2635,4.713665943600867
