8363381,2,6300188310,"An outrageously silly Italian comedy. A failed musician finds purpose by exposing his wife's body in public places. He first begins by photographing her while she's asleep. The prim wife discovers the photos and leaves him. After they reconcile, she agrees to go along with his wishes. Not surprisingly, the dubbing is handled poorly for this video tape edition. The voice actors sound like slick infomercial hucksters reading from teleprompters.  This must have felt dated even back in 1971. Veteran actor Lando Buzzanca plays the husband, and Laura Antonelli is the wife.",1142380800,4,573,5.228260869565218
