1621993,5,B00005LDDB,"Boy, do I agree with the other review: this movie is sooo good, so underrated that it's odd that it wasn't a bigger hit. The known story is: a group of mean, hard criminals go to Las Vegas to rob one of the casinos, the robbery goes fairly well, but they didn't know that the meanest, most badass of them doesn't believe in splitting the money. I have to say that I was surprised by the role of Kevin costner, psychotic characters are very common, violent ones too, but very few of them can come even close to the way Costner looks and acts in this film (there's a scene when he intimidates the guy who was going to clean the money, where you can really feel how threatening he is, how violent and psychotic he could get). Kudos for Kevin, even if he wasn't one of my favorite actors, he is one now. Forget the negative reviews, forget the pseudo-connoisseurs who want to show how clever and witty they are and how ignorant and fool we (audiences) are: this is a great way to spend two hours of thrills and fun, not everything has to be existencial or meaningful, this film is fun, entertainment, and Costner is greater than life here, cooler that any character you can remember. Watch this movie, buy the DVD, you'll be thanking you did. Really.",991353600,17,1246,4.3982683982683985

MY REVIEW:
""A riveting rush of excitment!  The action is great!  But we want more action!  The middle of the film is just ...!  The ending sequence was one of the biggest blow-out non-stop action packed scenes I've ever seen!  See it for the Vegas shootout, the action-packed end, and the in-between humor here and there!""- MJV & the Movies.",991180800,,432,4.706666666666667
1621995,5,B00005LDDB,"Stamped in Style and Covered in Cool, ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" has Instantly become one of my Favourite films of All Time. Two of my Favourite Actors on the Planet (Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, who also faced off a few years ago with their Rival Wyatt Earp pics, ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"") Face Off in the most Explosive Action film since ""Desperado"".
Yes, it's Morally Reprehensible, So What. All Style, No Substance... Hardly. Yes, it Glorifies Violence. So did ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" and They are classed as Classics. In Time.. So with ""3KMTG"", but not your Regular Classic, it's a Cult Classic. The Definition of a Cult Classic is a film that Critics Hated, Audiences Ignored, gets Attention of Video due to a Built in Fan Base (Elvis fans.. Anyone) and Eventually grows into a Force to be Reckoned with. It'll Happen.. Oh yes.. It'll Happen.
Not since Tarantino and his Black-Suited Jewel Thieves Slow-Moed their way into Crim-Cinema History with ""Reservoir Dogs"" has Crime ever looked So Cool. Costner may not be Looking very Youthful these days, but he Acts with a Teens Energy as Thomas J Murphy, the Heathen with a Heart of Stone. Russell balances the Scales as Michael Zane, The Heavy with the Heart of... Bronze. Gold would have been taking things a Little Far. He's Nice, but he Ain't that nice. He's Mel in ""Payback"" nice; he's the Diet Coke of nice, Just One Calorie... Not Nice Enough. They both give Ultra-cool Infinitely Fun Performances. Kurt makes the Perfect mix of ""Snake Plissken"" Strong Silent type, ""Gabriel Cash"" Humour and ""Elvis"" Cool. Costner creates a Character unlike Anything in His Resume. (his Southern Crim in ""A Perfect World"" would come closest) He is 100% Cool, I was Grinning Ear to Ear Every time he was On Screen. The Whole film is Anti-Hero-Heaven. (which is Also were many of the characters End Up)
Oh Yeah, the film also features Christian Slater, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Bokeem Woodbine, Kevin Pollak, John Lovitz, Howie Long, Ice T and Thomas Haden Church... But Forget them, this is Kurt and Costner's pic All the Way.
Demian Lichtenstein's Frenetic Direction is as Warped and Wild as the films Morals. It is Blindingly Obvious that his Career stems from Music Videos, but I'll always think of him as ""The Sandman"" as he has made the Film of my Dreams. The Perfect Cocktail of Crime-Caper, Over-the-Top Action and Black Comedy. The kind of film that No one else has the Guts to make in Hollywood. (John Woo makes this kind in Hong Kong; Robert Rodriguez makes them in Mexico) If you Haven't made This Trip to Graceland, Forget the Critics, Get your Bubblegum and Go. It is a Wild, Wild ride that you Won't Soon Forget.",991094400,,2690,4.774678111587983

1622001,5,B00005LDDB,"While some may not have seen what I call the ""earlier version"" of ""3000 Miles To Graceland,"" the premise for the script IS quite obviously loosely based on blacklisted Hollywood director Jules Dassin's 1955 crime heist movie ""du Rififi Chez les Hommes""--or ""Rififi"" (think rif raf).  In 3000 Miles To Graceland, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner turn in star performances as former cellmates recently released from a federal penitentiary.  When they first meet up on the outside, the look that Costner gives Russell as he slowly runs his gaze up and down Russell's body is almost sickening as you imagine the uncertain meeting of former cellmates might be.  Costner has planned an elaborate heist at a Vegas casino during an Elvis convention in 2001, but things soon go awry.  Kurt Russell co-stars, along with Courtney Cox, Thomas Haden Church, David Arquette, Howie Long and Jon Lovitz.  Paul Anka even turns in a wickedly evil cameo performance as the chief of security at the Las Vegas casino where the film is staged.  The group of thieves dress up as Elvis impersonators to pull off a big money robbery, and they plan to do it right in front of everybody.  The succeed, after a fashion, but not without a hail of gunfire which caused most critics to give the movie resoundingly bad reviews.  The shoot-em-up scenes are further enhanced with a grinding guitar-laced soundtrack--that enhances the gunfire to an almost-too fevered pitch.  The movie is about a bunch of ex-cons, and the so-called honor among thieves.  If you can just keep the volume control close at hand, the shooting scenes are few and the intricate details of the camera work and the directing and ensemble acting are enough to create an enjoyable experience for the discerning viewer.  At the end of the movie, as Costner is staring into a dirty restroom's grime-stained mirror, Elvis sideburns and a snarl on his lips, he says in a deep voice ""how do you like me now?""--and you know that it's Elvis to whom he is speaking.  Oh yeah, one of the guys gets the girl, but that may not be enough of a hook to bring your girlfriend or wife to this one!",1495843200,,2118,4.725543478260869

Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner make an outstanding mano e mano and both give awesome performances with Costner playing one of the best villains in film history. The rest of the cast are all excellent as well. This really is a first rate thriller and has some truly adrenaline rushing action scenes.

1622019,2,B00005LDDB,"3000 Miles to Graceland is a strange kind of double cross caper film.  It seems to be a tribute to the King Elvis Presley but comes off kind of
clunky and underachieving action movie.  I like a lot of Kurt Russell films and Kevin Costner movies but this film is a mess.  The film takes to many turns and just seems totally unbelievable.  It is not surprisingly that Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner clashed a lot on set.  Costner seems to be a movie star too big for his britches unwilling to play a supporting role instead of the lead at this point in his career and his need to dominate the camera hurts the movie.  The movie has none of the fun of a movie like Tango and Cash in the 1980s movie.

The film does not start out to badly.  The casino robbery is pretty interesting up until the big pause at the end of the getaway scene by Murphy on the rooftop.  Costner over acts trying to be sympathetic to the criminal he caused to be killed by his delay.  I didn't buy it as a viewer and doubtful the audience did either.  Kurt Russell is a more interesting character in the movie but is not given to much to work with.  So much of the movie seems over the top and farfetched.  Costners character Murphy is not a very good villain just an unlikable A-hole.  Who cares if Sinatra vs. Elvis would win in a fight.  They both had ties to the mob it might have been more interesting to see whose entourage would win in a fight between Elviss people or Sinatras.

Overall the movie is forgettable and Kurt Russells character Michael seems bored and just going through the motions as does Courtney Cox who probably just signed onto the film to get a payday.  There are much better action movies out there even during this time period Conair, The Rock, Spider Man you name it all of them were better than this film.  I would rate this a 2 star action movie it is not a total failure but comes very close to it.  By the end of the film you probably won't find any deep feeling for any of the characters and will have little sympathy to root for any of them.",1459900800,,2049,4.221079691516709

1622064,4,B00005LDDB,"Those who love Hong Kong gangster movies of the 1990s will find a lot of familiar tropes here. The heavily styled violence, cuts in and out of slow motion, obsessive gun fetishism, ambivalent male-male relationships, wailing guitar soundtrack (extremely reminiscent at one point of Full Contact starring Chow Yun Fat) ... it's so highly derivative, Ringo Lam should get a cut of the royalties.

Still Hollywood adds to the formula with car fetishism, desert sleaze, and a sexy motel babe who's just in it for the money--or is she? And here we get to a series of major script problems, as we're supposed to believe that a woman who abandons her child and kicks her love interest out of a moving car, onto the street, is really a devoted lover with a soft heart. And, a recently released criminal who participates in the theft of millions and the wanton killing of dozens of cops is actually a nice guy shaping up to be a good father figure for a ten-year-old boy ... who is a compulsive thief yet we know he will turn out okay because he throws his toy guns away. We really need that cohesive family unit at the end to redeem the whole thing, don't we? Well, no, but Hollywood thinks we do, so we're stuck with it.

Thus the plot is not driven by character; the characters bend themselves unconvincingly to conform with the plot.

There are also some major plausibility issues, such as marked money that needs to be laundered, yet somehow doesn't need to be, after the money launderer is eliminated from the action. Not to mention a binding contract to split a large amount of stolen money with an individual who is under legal age. Reeeally?

Fortunately there's enough deranged violence to distract from these problems, most of the time at least, and even some recurring spasms of ""artistic"" editing can't entirely ruin the action. 3000 Miles ends up as an unrepentantly rebellious study of criminal psychopaths with minimal redeeming traits, which is why I liked it, even though it steals flagrantly from those 1990s Chinese movies, which were really so much better. The essence of Chow Yun Fat is actually reconstructed here a lot more successfully than in the Tarantino moves, in my opinion.",1422316800,,2195,4.738219895287958

1622082,4,B00005LDDB,"3000 MILES TO GRACELAND is a crime movie that starts out with some easygoing scenes in a lower class home in the Nevada desert, but soon ramps up a commotion-ridden heist of a glitzy casino.  It seems that at least a quarter of the time in this movie takes the form of gunfights and chase scenes.  There are plenty of gunfights, with sparks and explosion, but not much bloodshed.  This is not really a gorey movie.  There are no severed body parts, for example.  As the film progresses, the gangsters make their way northwards from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Boise, Idaho, and eventually to the Canadian border and beyond. The final third of this film takes place in the Pacific northwest.

PLOT SUMMARY.  Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, and others dress up as Elvis impersonators.  In this way, they gain access to a Las Vegas, Nevada casino, and manage to steal a travelbag filled with cash.  Courtney Cox plays the love interest to Kurt Russell.  During the entire heist, the film shows an in-progress stage show that features of bevy of long-legged performers and one male Elvis impersonator.  The team of gangsters is able to make their getaway by way of a helicopter.  But from that point on, many things go wrong.  There is in-fighting between the gangsters.  One scene takes place at a taxidermist, and the viewer is treated to a tense standoff between a money-launderer, where the scene takes place amidst dozens of stuffed wild animals.  The money-launderer, who runs the taxidermy shop, is played by Jon Lovitz.  At the conclusion of the movie, only one of the gangsters makes it to freedom in Canada.  And guess who gets the girl.

CONTINUING THEMES.  A continuing theme is the relationship between Courtney Cox and her son, and the issue of Kurt Russell's ambivalent emotional connection to each of them.  Another continuing theme, is the question of who has the travelbag filled with money.  Yet another theme, is changing from one escape vehicle to another, and then to yet another.  An amusing scene is where Keven Costner manages to hijack a minivan owned by a wombat fanatic.  The minivan is crudely painted to resemble a clown-car, and on the dashboard is a wombat bubblehead.

CONCLUSIONS.  This is a fairly decent movie, providing that you don't mind noisy gunfights with machineguns.  The plot and the relationships were carefully crafted.  If you subtracted all of the gunfights, then you would still have a fine movie.  This is not really my type of movie, since I have no interest in flashy videogames, and no interest in endless machinegun battles, as one finds here.  A continuing theme, which was craftfully presented in this picture, is the ability of Courtney Cox's son to engage in petty crime.  But for a better movie that concerns a child having a relationship with seasoned criminals, I recommend TIGER BAY, starring Hayley Mills.  The final episode of the movie takes place in the northern reaches of Canada.  This reminded me of the crime-movie, INSOMNIA, starring Al Pacino and Hillary Swank, which takes place in Alaska.

I am not sure why 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND was poorly received by the public and by the critics.  In fact, because of America's love affair with videogames with strobelights, spark-effects, and such, I would have expected the American public to be attracted to this movie, with its endless stroboscopic machinegun rat-a-tats.  If 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND is available at your local library, then I guarantee that your 2-hours of watching will not have a dull moment.  However, there are many other crime movies that are more worthy of your time and contemplation.  For crime movies that take place in the northwest, I suggest THE PLEDGE with Jack Nicholson, and INSOMNIA with Al Pacino and Hillary Swank.",1397347200,2,3754,4.882911392405063

3KMTG is one of those guilty pleasures of a film that comes by every so long. Make no mistake, it is a B-movie. But it's got an A-cast. Most of the characters are morally vacuous if not degenerate. But that's the fun of it! How many movies pretend to be about bad people but aren't? (Payback anyone?) That's where this movie is so great. Kevin Costner is Murphy, a monumental scumbag without mercy or pity. You half hope the S.O.B gets away with it. Kurt Russel is great too, as is Cox, and Slater. There are really no good characters in this movie, just degrees of bad. Even Cox's son is a a little thief.

3KMTG also has some vintage cars and a cool soundtrack with lots of Elvis songs.

Lucky for me, my interest had been piqued by its all star cast and large budget for that time.

WOW! what a great crime action film. It is an interesting mix of brutal crime action peppered with just enough comedy to keep it from being too dark. Yes, there is plenty of violence and senseless murder (not a movie for kids or tweens), but the interplay between Russel and Cox, and Costner's frustrated determination keep the film fun. It has plenty of twists that will hold your interest all the way to a satisfying ending. The movie didn't do well at the box office or with critics, but don't be fooled...

3000 Miles to Graceland is a ""sleeper"" of a crime action film that delivers nicely.",1353715200,,851,4.47741935483871

Mr. Magoo",1352851200,,210,3.883720930232558
1622115,1,B00005LDDB,"I was up late night and found 3000 Miles to Graceland on, and since there was nothing else on I decided to watch it. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as when I first watched the film in theater back in 2001, and yes I stupidly paid to see this in the theater. It had been over 10 years since I've seen this movie. Who know my opinion of the film might have changed, but after watching it again it hasn't. It's just a terrible movie. This will be one of my shorter reviews and there I think will be some spoilers, but I don't care since this is just a terrible film.

The story revolves around a group of bank robbers (Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, David Arquette and Bokeem Woodbine) dress up as Elvis's and rob a Las Vegas Casino. Things go wrong when Woodbine (Franklin) is shot by police and security. The four remaining robbers escape by helicopter with the help of Jack (Howie Long). The four head back to their run down motel outside Vegas to sort their shares, but Murphy (Costner) as other plans as he shots and kills Gus (Arquette), Hanson (Slater) and believes he's also killed Michael (Russell) who was wearing a vest. From there on it's a race to get the money as Cybil Waingrow (Courteney Cox) and her son get mixed up with it along with two US Marshal's (Thomas Haden Church, Kevin Pollak).

The bad story was bad enough, but adding in uninteresting and uninteresting characters and you've got a terrible film. Russel's character was supposed to play the good guy as he had a conscience, but that doesn't take away that his character is about as interesting and likeable as a rock you have to stare at four hours kind of like this film. Costner playing the bad guy seemed not to want to be in this awful film. He probably was wondering when his career took a downward turn. It was just a few years ago he was starring in films like A PERFECT WORLD, ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, JFK and THE BODY GUARD. I think his career took a turn with WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN. Waterworld wasn't good, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, especially if you watch the extended edition. The Postman in my opinion is a good film, but not great. Still neither were box office hits and his career started to go downward until he relegated to star in crappy heist films like this one. The most interesting and fun characters are the the supporting characters. Howie Long the ex-NFL player turned analysis and actor was having a fun time with this film as he had no pressure on him. Also Thomas Haden Church and Kevin Pollak seemed to have good chemistry as partners and to be honest I was rooting for them to kill all the bank robbers including Russel's character.

You'd expect the action to be good in a heist film. Now I wasn't expecting great action like HEAT that was just a special film, but I was expecting to be entertained. I wasn't and outside of the beginning action scene in the casino which was decent it was all bad. Even the climax in a warehouse was a let down. There's lots of blame to go around for the lack of good action, you could blame the studio Warner Brothers for this, but I don't. I think the WB gave up on this film after they saw it, and if I remember it right there wasn't a lot of promotion for this film. You could just tell WB had no confidence in this film. No I blame the director Demian Lichtenstein who also co-wrote this piece of crap. Apparently Demian was a big music video director, but had only directed one feature film before this one called Lowball, and I had to look it up to find out that it was a direct to VHS film. Maybe I should blame WB for hiring this guy to write and direct a feature film, because he's terrible.

Overall 3000 Miles to Graceland is a terrible film and as bad a I remember it. If you haven't seen this film avoid it at all costs. It will drain away months of your life.",1350086400,,3862,4.308115543328748

Russell plays the good guy that does illegal stuff like robbery but won't cross the line to the dark side where Costner's character lives.

1622125,5,B00005LDDB,"Sure seems like we have a lot of uptight movie reviewers here.

This is a great flick with a lot of action and a fun story. People need to stop over-analyzing it as some kind of Elvis tribute, etc. It's not. It doesn't try to be. It's simply an action movie with a simple plot. Easy to follow and fun to watch. Lots of action. Lots of violence.

I absolutely loved the soundtrack - seems they picked the right tunes at the right time to set the tone for each scene. For example, ""Vapor Trail"" by The Crystal Method is used to set the tone for their initial arrival into Vegas and ""Smartbomb"" by BT on their entrance into the casino. It's perfect music with perfect timing. The music really controls the mood throughout the movie.

So ignore the detractors. Just watch the movie for the fun of it. It's an entertaining flick. No matter how good a movie is, you'll always get reviewers who insist on being contrary just for the sake of being contrary or jumping on a bandwagon just because everyone else is. Most of the negative reviews seem about as eloquent as something written by an 8 year old - that alone should tell you something.",1245369600,2,1135,4.395238095238096
1622127,4,B00005LDDB,"Normally I do not watch anything this violent.  Normally I avoid any movie with Kevin Costner in it.  The first because I just do not care to see violence.  I once got talked into going to the drive-in to see  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I spent the whole evening with the sun visor down on the passenger side of the car, trying the best I could to not listen.  The second because normally with Kevin Costner it is just Kevin Costner walking through a role.  I never seem to accept him as whatever character he is playing.

We were flipping through the channels on cable one night and came across this movie about half way through.  I got hooked into watching it.  Having not seen the beginning I went back another night to catch that part.  I ended up watching the whole movie.

Basic story plot is about a band of Elvis impersonators that rob a casino.  They then end up double crossing each other.  That was just about a given.

Cybil Waingrow (Courtney Cox) is a very dysfunctional mom with a son, Jesse Waingrow (David Kaye) who is fast on his way to becoming a criminal.  One scene has Cybil making gymnastic love to Michael Zane (Kurt Douglas).  Jesse sneaks into the bedroom during the lovemaking and steals Michael's wallet.

The master mind of the heist is Murphy played by Kevin Costner.  It was a very different role than I am used to seeing Kevin in.  Murphy has almost no redeeming qualities.  He kills just about everybody he encounters.  What got me is that for the most part I forget it was Kevin Costner.

If there is a good guy in the movie it is Michael Zane played by Kurt Russell.  Kurt Russell has a tendency to play these characters with about one or two emotional responses, generally a depressive individual with a flat affect.  He does so here.

The movie moves fast.  It is very violent in the beginning and very violent in the end.  While most of the plot twists and turns were predictable they kept me involved.

Quigley is played by Thomas Haden Church of Wings fame.  I just never really bought him as the Federal Marshall chasing these crooks.

The soundtrack was really good, and there were more than a few Elvis tunes scattered through out the film.  I'm not a huge Elvis fan, but hey he is The King.

There were some pieces at the end that I did not put together the first time I watched the film.  Thinking about the movie after the second viewing gave it a little different flavor.  Nuff said, do not want to give that away.

I am still trying to put my finger on why I cannot stop thinking about this movie.  It was well done.  It was entertaining.  Maybe it was all the dysfunctional characters.  Maybe it was the soundtrack.  But for some reason it sticks.  I'm not going to watch it again tomorrow, but I could see me doing so a few months from now.",1239408000,,2793,4.396078431372549

It's a violent, crude and un-apologetic heist movie that doesn't even consider it's audience.

Kevin Costner gets the slimiest and most disrespecting role he's ever received.  Playing Thomas Murphy, the supposed love child of Elvis Presley he also happens to be a low grade armed robber.  Pulling the biggest heist in his life Thomas and a few others, including Michael Zane (Kurt Russell) dress up as a gaggle of Elvis impersonators and pull a casino heist for over 3 million dollars.  When things go wrong and people are double crossed, the chase is on.  Michael is running from Thomas and the FBI, along the way he picks up Cybil Waingrow (Courtney Cox Arquette, shaking the Friends role of Monica).

As the movie moves on, no characters are found to be very reputable.  I kept having to ask myself what the point was of this story.  Costner is the only one who can be praised for playing such a snake, but at the same time he does it with such ferocity, you want Thomas to die as soon as possible.

1622140,3,B00005LDDB,"Plot Summary: A crime gang robs a Las Vegas casino disguised as Elvis impersonators.

Reason for the Rating: Strong violence, sexuality and language.

Watching 3,000 MILES TO GRACELAND I have to admit felt guilty for enjoying a movie that had so few redeeming qualities. Directed by Demian Lichtenstein, it sports an all-star cast including Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Courteney Cox Arquette, Christian Slater, David Arquette, and Ice-T. It's a shoot-em-up flick, filled with gratuitous violence.

In the movie Costner plays Murphy, a guy who assembles a band of criminals to make a hit on the casino during an Elvis convention. Each member of the gang dresses like Elvis to fit in with the menagerie of impersonators visiting Vegas. The robbery is successful--and also allows the director to shoot excessive amounts of gunfire resulting in the demise of slot machines, drinking glasses, gaudy mirrors, and cops.

After the gang escapes the casino with over $3 million (and just one casualty despite the incredible hail of bullets) the gang falls victim to its own greed. The rest of the movie consists of Murphy and cohort Michael (played by Russell) chasing the other to retrieve the money the gang members keep stealing from each other.

Meanwhile, Michael develops a love interest in Cybil (Cox Arquette), who is the Mom of a bright but crime-waiting-to-happen type of child. Eventually Michael's love of Cybil and her son results in him having to choose between love and money.

As I said, the movie is entertaining at times, with plot twists and nonstop action. One bright spot is the cameo of rapper Ice-T, playing a hired gun protecting Murphy. His acting is a delightful mix of street-wise meanness and humor.

The fatal weakness, though, is the director's desire to spend most of the movie creating redundant scenes of violence. Yes, I enjoyed the movie to an extent, but I couldn't recommend it. Mainly what captured my attention was watching this group of all-star actors attempting to salvage a weak script.

Nappaland.com Recommends: Great Actors + Weak Script = Mostly a Waste of Time.

After the Show...If members of your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward:

---What positive qualities, if any, did you see in the main characters?

---Do you think excessive violence as portrayed in this movie lead people to a cheap view of human life? Explain your answer?

---Why do you suppose so many people like to impersonate Elvis? Whom would you most like to impersonate?

1622166,5,B00005LDDB,"Let's break this down and serve it up faster and hotter than one of those fried banana-and-peanut-butter sandwiches The King himself loved so much: ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" is one of the fastest, tightest, hottest, gun-slingingest, ammo-pumpingest, dead sexy, little bloodbaths I've ever had the good fortune to come across.

One blue suede shoe over two hours long, director Demian Lichtenstein has created a white-hot little shot of pure cinematic adrenaline, cooked up with some of the tightest editing I've ever seen, brutal gun battles in which every bullet-riddled sequence keeps trying to up the ante on its predecessor, a Las Vegas casino (the Riviera) full of Elvis impersonators of every size, shape and sort, sexy Vegas showgirls with abs of steel, toe-tapping techno and rockabilly tunes to accompany the grand carnage, more double-crosses and twists than a West Virginia logging road, and high-voltage double barrelled starpower featuring Kevin Costner in his best role ever (as a villain!), Kurt Russell, Courteney Cox, Christian Slater, and David Arquette.

Besides, how can you fault a movie that takes the average action film's gunfight quotient, triples it, and delivers the gory goods in spades---*and* begins and ends with a techno scorpion deathmatch *and* a bloodbath? Answer: You can't.

The plot is action-movie simplicity itself: Russell plays drifter and con-man Michael Zane, who hooks up with fellow footpad Thomas Murphy (played to the rhinestone-plated hilt by Kevin Costner) and two other villains (Christian Slater and Bokeem Woodbine) to pull off a 3.2 million dollar heist at the Las Vegas Riviera casino during the International Elvis Impersonator Night.

Director Lichtenstein is my kind of director, too: he doesn't waste time with lots of exposition, but digs right into the main attraction and shoots our jumpsuit-costumed perfectly-coiffed Memphis drawling robbers into the casino, and ""3000 Miles"" starts out with one of the slickest, lead-pumpingest gunfights this side of Blue Hawaii, to say nothing of the surreal sequence with the helicopter set to the toe-tapping goodness of Elvis's ""Such a Night"".

Faster than you can fry up a Montecristo sandwich the casino gets robbed, crosses get doubled, conspirators get buried in shallow graves, Russell falls in with the sultry Cox and her son, the Feds get called in, and nothing but trouble looms for everyone involved. The editing here is tight, the gun-battles intense, the Elvis riffs yummy, the dancing girls delicious, and the climactic stand-off is roaring good fun, pitting Kevin Costner's drawling and well-armed lunatic against a small army of SWAT police.

Lichtenstein delivers the goods with tight editing and breathless action, making the finished product look like it cost three times as much as it did. The acting here is also all first rate, from Cox and Costner (who should play more villains), to Russell (who exudes pure unadulterated cool), to Slater, Woodbine, and a small squad of veteran character actors---including Jon Lovitz as a money launderer, Howie Long in yet *another* role as a hip thug, Ice-T as the hitman's hitman, and even Lorraine Cote, who has made a career playing an old lady surgically attached to a Las Vegas one-armed bandit.

If you're looking for deep and introspective, look elsewhere---but if you're looking for a rip-roaring, take-no-prisoners little hound dog of a movie that the King himself would have enjoyed, ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" is three thousand miles of pure delight.

1622169,3,B00005LDDB,"There are things to like in this movie.  But to overstay your welcome can be deadly, no matter how many fun things you put in.  And 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND could've really taken off if it had eliminated one or two sequences late in the film.

The centerpiece, as far as action goes, is the Vegas heist itself: an uneasy gang dresses up as Elvis impersonators and knocks off a casino in the first part of the film.  The robbery is bold, the setting is dynamic, the gunplay is loud and destructive--and everything from that point just doesn't have the scope or energy.

There are no surprises from the characters either after the mid-point, which is too bad.  The Federal Agents could've been developed better and added more humor.

Kevin Costner is great and he looks like, despite his stoic menace, he's having a good time.

In my opinion, the movie works because of Kurt Russell.  The movie would not be as much fun to watch if they had cast someone else.

Why?

Kurt played Elvis in a 1979 TV movie directed by John Carpenter--and he was great.  To see him in a jumpsuit and snarling that lip got a smile from everyone in the room.

Not only that: Kurt actually appeared in a movie with Elvis.  When Kurt gets kicked by the little boy in the opening scenes of this movie, I had to laugh: that was Kurt's role in IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR, kicking Elvis in the shin.  If you look closely, when admiring female fans ask for his character's autograph in the casino elevator, he's signing the soundtrack cover to IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.

(Another trivia note--and there are probably more I didn't catch during a first viewing--but Courtney Cox's son is named ""Jesse,"" which was Elvis' stillborn twin brother's name).

With all that said, I wanted to like this movie more...but it just didn't know when to ""leave the building,"" baby.",1126569600,,1845,4.5592705167173255

Costner's part is written even worse and he chews scenery like he's channeling Pacino. There are bad edits, scenes that make no sense and have nothing to do with the plot (what plot there is), and violence just for the sake of violence, sex for the sake of sex and nothing has anything to do with storytelling. I don't know who the writer/director is but someone stop him before he makes another film.",1115337600,5,748,4.388489208633094
1622171,1,B00005LDDB,"I'll admit it. I love to go to see big, dumb action films. On certain weekends, Joel Silver calls me to the local multiplex to watch his latest offering. I go to big, dumb action films for the stunts, for the action, for the testosterone. ""3000 Miles To Graceland"", the new film starring Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, is not produced by Joel Silver, but I hoped it would provide me with a Joel Silver fix.

Michael Zane (Kurt Russell) has just been released from prison. He drives into a fleabag motel on the outskirts of the desert and immediately hooks up with a single mom, Cybil (Courteney Cox), living in the motel. Soon, Thomas J. Murphy (Kevin Costner) drives up with three other thugs. Zane and Murphy shared a cell together. They are planning to rob the Riviera Casino in Las Vegas. The hook? The Riviera is hosting an Elvis Impersonator Convention and they will all dress like Elvis and use that as a cover. Murphy brings Hanson (Christian Slater), Gus (David Arquette) and Franklin (Bokeem Woodbine) along for the ride. The heist proceeds and they run into complications.

There are a lot of problems with ""3000 Miles"", so many that the movie is ultimately a disaster. Kurt Russell is actually a very underrated actor. He has made some solid, very satisfying films in the last few years. ""Breakdown"" was a very underrated suspense film. However, I don't think ""3000 Miles"" will be a film that he wants to remember for very long. He tries, very hard, to eke out some moments of drama and tenderness as he tries to develop a relationship with Cybil and her son. Russell is a fine actor, but the writing is not there. These scenes feel almost as though they were tacked on as an afterthought.

Kevin Costner plays a murderous psychopath, the first time he has attempted a character such as this since ""A Perfect World"", directed by Clint Eastwood. Considering the success he has had playing this type of character, he should probably stick to playing heroes. Wait! Considering the success he has had playing heroes lately, perhaps he should stick to... something that doesn't involve acting. Costner owes me for the three plus hours I spent watching ""Wyatt Earp"", for the two plus hours I spent watching ""Waterworld"".

Christian Slater, Bokeem Woodbine, David Arquette, Howie Long, Jon Lovitz and Ice-T all pop up for short cameos. The relative stardom of each of these people can be debated, but the purpose of any of these people doing what amounts to a cameo should be that they create a memorable character. Sorry, doesn't happen.

The casino heist is actually very early in the film and rather quick. No time is spent detailing their preparations and when the heist begins it almost appears as though no planning went into the execution. The heist is also very bloody. I have no problem with violence in films, as long as it makes sense in the course of the story. Each of the participants waves their guns around, shooting anything and everything in sight, glass and mirrors erupting. They are clearly not aiming at anything and therefore demolish the area around them. ""3000 Miles"" has gratuitous violence, which I do have a problem with.

After the heist, the film eventually becomes a road picture. Again, not much makes sense during this part of the film.

The director, a first-timer, cross cuts the casino heist with endless shots of showgirls and Elvis impersonators. This is, I think, supposed to be cutting edge. This was cutting edge in the 60s, when the real Elvis was making horrible excuses for films simply so he could generate new hit songs.

Ultimately, everything in the film equals nothing and I doubt that you would enjoy catching this film on cable, for free, in the middle of the night, when nothing else is on.",1113264000,3,3748,4.737730061349693

Some great action scenes, great chemistry between all involved..... and then all of a sudden, most of the cast is killed off and what we are left with is; Kurt Russell and a child actor who really never work, a relationship with Coutney Cox that was never believable, hot potatoe with a bag of money, and Kevin Costner in a Wombat suit. How is that for a mental image?

This could have been a great movie if they would have done the following; take more time with the build up to the actual ""heist"". Since that was the highlight, to have it happen within the first 20 mintues leaves the rest of the movie gasping for air. By doing this it would have given more screen time to ""the crew of Elvis's"" plus given the audience more of a shock when Costner goes renegade.

However, it IS an entertaining way to spend a couple hours.

Kurt Russell is the hero/bad guy who takes up with the treacherous Courteney Cox and her potentially criminal son, well played by David Kaye.  The reason:  partner Kevin Costner has killed most of his cohorts because he wants all the money, but Russell is wearing a bulletproof vest, so thus begins the chase and revenge movie.  Don't expect to see much of Christian Slater, David Arquette, Howie Long or Ice-T.  They aren't in the movie much at all.  Ditto Bokeem Woodbine and Jon Lovitz.  Also showing up are Kevin Pollak, Thomas Haden Church and a hilarious Paul Anka.  The movie is pretty violent and sadistic at times.  It also strangely opts to use some comic scenes at the end credits to kind of say, ""Hey, this was only a movie, and weren't the stars having fun?""

Russell tries hard, but his character isn't all that likeable either.  Although refreshing to see Costner trying to widen his scope of characters, his performance is a little too hammy.  Ditto Cox, who tries so hard to be likeable, but she's pretty deceptive too.

Not only do the four Elvis impersonators never perform together (now wouldn't THAT have been a sight), but Kevin Costner is quite dreadful. And I normally like him too! It's safe to say that I liked him in The Bodyguard and Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (apart from the hair!), but I get put off by the constant chain smoking! I just don't like guys (or girls, ruining their good looks) who smoke. It's a complete & utter turn off. I also like Mel Gibson - apparently I'll hate him if I ever see Payback.
Courtney Cox does little more than flaunt her body and `get it on' with Kurt Russell. And speak with what I think was supposed to be a bad Southern accent.
Apparently there could have been another version of this. Kurt Russell had a version, which was more comedy orientated, and focused more on his relationship with Courtney Cox. Kevin Costner's version was more action orientated. And guess which one was put out to the viewing public? Kevin Costner's version. The guy has a serious of flops under his belt, yet keeps churning them out. And we're supposed to trust this guy when he brings out a film? Whatever.
The connection between Elvis 'The King' Presley, and Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner pitiful attempts as Elvis impersonators, was never quite explained, unless you've got a keen eye for detail, and can put two and two together and get the right answer. I won't give it away either, but why are they apparently so desperate to avenge him?! That whole part was obviously cut or something. Either that or I just didn't get it.
If you want to see the best bit, watch over the credits. Kurt Russell lip syncs (albeit badly) to an Elvis song, which I'd never heard of, although it was ""Such a Night"". The rest of the characters dance around (Courtney), or point their guns. There's also an outtake, which is funny! And don't ask me what the meaning of the title is. I've been told, but I don't think it made any sense to me at the time - and that's without drink!",1084492800,7,2632,4.519916142557652
1622198,2,B00005LDDB,"3000 Miles to Graceland was advertised as a very different movie. I have to say, if I could just watch movies made by the guys who put together previews, I'd be a lot happier.
The preview emphasized the whole Elvis angle. To wit: a bunch of crooks decide to rob a Vega casino dressed as Elvises (Elvi?). Kevin Costner plays Thomas Murphy, the bastard child of Elvis. Actually, there's possibly two bastard children of Elvis in this movie. Ya see, there were 35 claimants stating that Elvis was their pop, but 33 of those DNA tests proved false. So who is the other Elvis-spawn? We're never told.
Anyway, that's all besides the point. That whole Elvis thing? That's not what the movie's about.
In fact, at first I thought the movie was about giant robot mecha. It starts with two computer generated robot-like scorpions battling each other to the death. Only they have big, grinning maws for faces. The black scorpion fights the silver scorpion. One of them is probably supposed to be the good guy. It doesn't matter, the movie seems to say, because they're both mean scorpions and you shouldn't be rooting for either one.
The first half hour of the movie is the aforementioned heist of the casino by the Elvis gang. The potential for entertainment is ruined by weird, stuttery camera shots and a total lack of rhythm. Interspersed between images of Elvis-impersonators firing machineguns are Broadway shows of elvis. But none of it gels quite right.
When we're not seeing Elvis with a gun, which apparently the director thinks is absolutely hysterical since he shows these shots over and over, we're seeing women do naughty sexual acts. Courtney Cox, in the first role as a sexual plaything that I can recall, acts as...well, a sexual plaything (unless you count Ace Ventura too). She also has a thieving little son named Jesse James. He likes to pick pockets and pretend he's a cowboy. There's a lot of Courtney moving up and down in the vicinity of a bed. If you like Ms. Cox, then this is as good as the movie gets.
There's definitely a misogynistic streak running through the film. It's most obvious when a random redhead shows up for no other reason than to provide fellatio for the bad guy - that's Murphy.
I'm no fan of Kevin Costner, but he does play a mad-dog-mean bad guy. The protagonist, if you can call him that, is Kurt Russell as Michael Zane. Russel kicks ass, even in this role. But he can't save this movie. In some twisted, good-vs-evil battle, the two characters go head to head again and again in car crashes, gunfights, and battles of wit. Okay, battles of potty-mouthed swearing.
I expected this movie to be witty, funny, cool in a fashion very similar to Ocean's Eleven. But this movie is like the anti-Ocean's Eleven. It sucks the cool out of other movies playing nearby. It features lots of foul language, the complete desecration of all things Elvis, Courtney Cox's ass, Christian Slater AND David Arquette, child abuse, and women as sex toys. It's a bitter, nasty, dirty film that has little redeeming value.",1079913600,11,3036,4.708646616541353

It's just an observation but the negative reviews for this movie are some of the longest reviews I've ever witnessed on Amazon. Somebody went to a lot of trouble to hate this movie in intricate detail.
I must admit that I enjoy Kurt Russell's and Kevin Costner's acting style so I found this movie likable even before I watched it. I also enjoyed the comic book way the story is told. Extreme camera angles and the ""music video"" approach to directing was appealing to me. There is some comedy in this movie if you choose to look for the subtle humor. It's just a movie about bad people doing bad things with some Elvis thrown it for the fun of it. Before the movie was over I found myself asking my wife: ""Do people this ruthless really exist?"" My wife hated the movie by the way, but that's another story.

Yeah, it's got gratuitous violence and some far-fetched parts, but it doesn't bore you with too many details and criss-crossing sub-plots. It's a lot better than the over-cast and over-rated Oceans Eleven.
I cant believe the slamming this movie got from some reviewers. Why do these righteous do-gooders even watch a movie like this? They know its not going to give them their required daily dose of morality, so why don't they stick to ""G"" rated movies? I'm tempted to give this movie a 5-star rating just to offset their attack on this movie.

1622220,1,B00005LDDB,"...would appear to be the director's philosophy, anyway (well, along with ""let's see how many different shots we can fit into twenty-five seconds of film""). This movie is bad. And by ""bad"", I don't mean ""good"". I mean really, horrifyingly, brain-numbingly, I-Want-To-Jam-My-Eye-Onto-Something-Pointy bad.
Still want to know what happens? Well, okay. There are five men, who rob a casino by dressing up as Elvis and killing a lot of people. When they've done that... oh, I don't know exactly what happens. But does plot really matter, in a movie like this? Doesn't seem like the people who made it think so. More people die, that's for sure, and do it dramatically, flying around and sending blood spurting all over the cartoonishly-coloured desert shots.
I don't have anything against violence, in films. Really, I don't. It's just that generally I like some other things, mixed in with it. And by that, I don't mean those sparkly bikini-clad dancing girls that were intercut, a lot, with the first bullets-and-blood-and-rhinestones killing spree. My other complaint about the gratuitous violence is that not enough of it was directed at David Arquette. Not meaning to sound evil, but he really puts the ""Die! NOW!"" into ""irritating"".
Back to the movie. In between the fast-forwarded shots of the desert and the weird techno music (well, kind of underneath the techno music if I'm to be truthful), there's some sort of vague storyline with Courteney Cox as a slutty single mother who alternates between sleeping with Kurt Russell's character whose name I forgot, and running off with all the money and without her son. The son, who is one of those smart-alecky wise-beyond-their-years kids that these kind of movies are liberally sprinkled with, is abandoned with Kurt Russell. (Insert your own ""A fate worse than death!"" type comment.)
Along its way, ""3000 Miles To Graceland"" gets hit by every clichd plot anvil you could think of. There's the one about ""the black guy dies first"". And the one about ""yes, the main character does kill twenty-six people per day on average, but he really does have a heart of gold and family values underneath it all"". And the one about... ah, frig it. It's not worth your time or effort.

What's worse is that there are some decent actors in here in roles that they all should have been embarrassed to take. Christian Slater gets my vote for the most underused of the lot.  Kevin Costner's lead is the Postman without a heart.

The story?  Who cares!  Well, pick up 5 or 6 B-list guys in Hollywood, and dress them in Elvis's stage costume, and send them to a casino in Las Vegas as Elvis impersonators.  They somehow rob the palce, take the money and run before making a havoc of Vegas with bloody shootouts and flashy pictures.  But they are no group of nice guys, so they then start to fight each other over money.  And join the landlady and her son at a local motel in the battle over this bag of stolen money.
The film is no ""Richard III,"" but as for its violence, it has something common with this classic.  The only difference is that I didn't find it funny or thrilling at all to see Kevin Costner playing a ruthless villain with sideburns.  If this film had been made only with other cast -- Kurt Russel (who took the top billing), Christian Slater, and many others -- things might be different.  Actually, they are not so bad.  After all, Russel played Elvis once on TV and briefly again in ""Forrest Gump"" (voice only), so he looks fairly good.
But the big problem is Kevin Costner, whose hammy performance shows that he didn't see any of Tarantino or John Woo films that this film aspires to be.  Cool attitudes of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta is not to be seen here;...
Actually, the most embarrasing moment comes at the very end of he film after the end-credit roll.  He quips, very happily to the camera, changing the original line into the most awful verbal joke committed on the big screen.  I was watching the film in Japan, and I really felt the reactions of embarrassed viewers with frozen faces.  Frozen.  But the sad thing is he thinks this is a real cool thing to say.
As the disappointing box-office figures show, audience have a knack of avoiding bad things, and their instincts should not be trifled with...  And 10 years later, ""3000 Miles"" was nominated for 5 categories at the Razzie Award, and it didn't win any of them.  Sad, isn't it?

Hardly a fine cinematic endeavor, but I was entertained nonetheless.  This was THE first time I've seen Kevin Costner as a vile, loathsome, foul-mouthed character - I liked it!  He's usually too sensitive & perfect to be credible.  I also can't remember when I last saw that much ammo expended.  Another noteworthy aspect of the movie is the emphasis they put on the ""code of honor"" and grudging respect between cops and criminals - namely outlaws.

This coupled with the news about clashing ego's, massive rewrites and multiple edits I felt completely justified in skipping this movie. Tonight I finally watched the movie and while I am glad I didn't pay...to see it, I was surprised by how entertained I was. The film jumps into the action with Zane (an ex-con played by Kurt Russell) showing up at a seedy hotel, meeting a single mother (Cox), then meeting Murphy (an insane ex-con friend played by Costner) and the gang he has assembled, and then robbing the casino. After the casino is robbed there is double crossing, double-double crossing and our poor hero Zane (we know he is the hero because even though he is participating in an armed robbery of a casino he seems upset when people get killed, and he never kills anyone himself.) doesn't know who to trust.
  The movie does have some things going its way. It has a great cast who seem to relish their roles. This is especially true of Costner who seems to have tapped his own ego for inspiration. He is actually enjoyable to watch as he revels in his evilness. Russell is also a great joy to watch. Having gotten one of his big breaks playing a young Elvis on a made for television biography directed by John Carpenter, Russell's Elvis has only improved with age. You just wish he spent more time in that sparkly white jumpsuit.

1622276,4,B00005LDDB,"Who does the better Elvis, Kurt Russell or Kevin Costner? Kurt Russell! No contest. Is this casino-robbing, car-chasing double-crossing pair of cons worth watching? You bet. It's a fun ride all the way from Vegas to Vancouver in Demian Lichtenstein's first film, 3000 Miles To Graceland.
This would make a great drive-in movie. Lots of style, a dash of substance and lots of shooting and explosions. You can tell our director was real interested in 'getting the shot'. The movie is really just a series of great shots, from our gang of Elvis-impersonating cons walking through the casino to Kevin Costner driving through the desert lighting a cigarrette as a gas station goes up in a ball of flame behind him. Yeah baby!
The premise may be simple, but the plot is kind of convoluted. Kurt Russell blows into town, hooks up with Courtney Cox Arquette for a quick fling, meets up with bad-boy Costner, dresses up like Elvis and rides off with three expendables to rob a casino. The heist works, but Costner pulls a double-cross leaving Kurt Russell with dents in his handy bullet-proof vest. Russell winds up with the money, the girl and her smart-mouthed son on his way to exchange his hot millions for cold cash. Costner chases him. The girl runs off with the money! Russell chases her, but Costner gets to her first. Russell and the kid get her back and all three go after the money again. Back and forth the money goes, until the final confrontation complete with explosions, shooting and a gratuitous Ice-T. Oh, and did I mention that Russell and Costner could be Elvis' illegitimate children? Oh yeah.
It's hard to know who the director wants the audience to identify with though. Is it Russell's understated con with a heart of gold, or Costner's con without a conscience, taking what he wants when he wants it? Since Kurt Russell's character has a good side, i'll say it is him. Lichtenstein has quite a bit of fun with Costner though. Clearly Costner has taken a seminar at the John Travolta cooler-than-my-costar school of acting. Much of his story line is told as if in a video-most of the one liners and money shots are his. In other words, the bad guy has all the fun.
Kurt Russell has spent his career playing likable characters, and this one is no exception. He plays his sequin-wearing convict with a humanity that's almost too fine for this movie, but he seems to have a good time doing it.
Costner enjoys himself too, as a sociopathic would-be son of the King. He really hams it up in this one, and the director favors him with music video-inspired imagery and a killer soundtrack featuring Filter, Hednoize and of course, Elvis.
Courtney Cox Arquette made her trashy, opportunistic mom  interesting and likeable, especially onscreen with Kurt Russell.
This is a very enjoyable film, in a 'movies for guys who like movies' kind of way, only chicks will dig it too.",1017187200,11,2880,4.725646123260438

Every review I read about this movie before I watched it was negative.  I went ahead and watched it anyway because I am a huge Kurt Russell fan, and I was not dissapointed.  I actually found it better than I thought I would considering that I really don't care for Kevin Costner.  It's not meant to be a comedy or a suspense thriller, it's meant to be entertaining, and with that in mind - it delivers!  Kurt is sexy, Courtney pulls off the sexy-trashy desperate hotty that she goes for, and Kevin actually made me like him for a change.  I was a little bit dissapointed that Christian Slater didn't have a larger role than he did, and when you stop to think about it, the only true mis-casting was David Arquette.  David just didn't seem to pull off the fact that he would be a bank robber, much less an Elvis impersonator.  All in all, this is one of my favorite movies and given the fact that I have a very extensive movie collection and have hardly ever recommended a movie to someone with dissapointments, I can say that this is definately worth watching.

The wholesale slaughter in the first ten minutes coupled with the fact there's not one single line of funny dialouge eliminates it from being a comedy and since the heist is pulled off at the beginning, it's out of contention as a suspense caper.
The initial idea of a group of Presley impersonators robbing a Las Vegas casino during ""Elvis"" week might have had some promise as kind of a redneck ""Ocean's 11"", but the robbery is pulled of at the top leaving the audience with nothing to do but watch Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell try to outsmart and double cross each other in a road film that would have been laughed off the screen 30 years ago.
The writers throw in Courtney Cox as a trailer park lollipop, probably figuring her following from ""Friends"" would bring the right demographics into the theater (It didn't happen), but her part amounts to nothing.
Costner probably thought playing a villian might give him a break from the nice guy image on the screen he's developed since the 80's, but the screenplay gives him nothing to work with, and Kurt Russell is around simply because of his resemblance to the King (he played Elvis in a TV biopic in 1979).

1622284,5,B00005LDDB,"In what may be the darkest comedy since ""Very Bad Things"", ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" is loud, nasty, violent, and funny as hell.  Kurt Russell is getting too old to play the action hero, so its a twist of fate for him playing an Elvis impersonating antihero.  The storyline is simple at first, Kurt Russell plays an Elvis lover who just got out of jail, has a fling with a surprisingly good Courtney Cox, then joins his old buddy fellow Elvis impersonator Kevin Costner and his partners Christian Slater and David Arquette.  The plan is to go into a casino, rob it, and get out.  But some things go wrong, and double crosses are abound.  This may well be Kevin Costner's best performance ever as the maniacal, but hilarious, Murphy.

1622308,4,B00005LDDB,"Waited quite a while before seeing this film. I have now come to the conclusion that I will NEVER solely listen to critics again. Critics seem to forget that there is always room for fun, trashy, road films like this. Being a Costner fan, at least 75% of the time (hated Waterworld), I hesistated to see him as a bad guy.
Loved the opening scorpion fight, the ""western-style"" shootout between Costner's bad guy, Murph, and the policeman, Costner's unending willingness to shoot everything and everybody in sight, the always present ""trashy girl in the gas station that decides to ride along with the killer"", the band of motorcycle guys who just happen to show up and say ""hi"" to Costner's Murphy just as he is enjoying himself in the car with the ""trashy girl..."". Doesn't anybody see how ""over the top"" this was supposed to be! Scene after scene was a road-movie cliche' designed for the audience to enjoy the ride. Mindless, trashy entertainment -- not the latest Oscar friendly film. Needless to say, I enjoyed every minute of this movie.
A Note to Kevin: don't smoke in movies. For some reason, you just don't have the ""touch"" -- you're just messy and unnatural. Even in a great film like ""The Untouchables"" you look like a guy who shouldn't smoke.

Brilliant picture editing starts from the animated scorpion fight well before the credits through the sequin jumpsuited Elvis impersonators, to the final climactic firefight.
A surprisingly riveting confection.
I found it sometimes meretricious but never soporific.
This kind of movie happens when a music video director (Demian Lichtenstein) decides he wants to be the next John Woo (or maybe Quentin Tarantino)...

1622313,1,B00005LDDB,"There are several bad movies out there, but at least they are easy to follow and live up to their billing.  3000 Miles to Graceland is not only a terrible movie, it's also completely incompetent and incoherent.  That's a shame, too, since the basic premise of the film, Elvis inpersonators planning a Vegas heist, has loads of potential.  At least that's what the previews would have us believe.  The main problem is that the movie wants desperately to be an action film, but it should've been played as an offbeat comedy.  But these filmmakers are not even close to being that imaginative, so instead we get this piece of trash.
And it's not even reliable trash.  We have Kevin Costner playing a cold-hearted hitman, one of the worst casting moves in history.  Costner is way too bland to play a bad guy, a role that needs some color, and he proves it ten-fold here.  Kurt Russell's character is also wooden; there's not one interesting quirk to his personality in plain sight.  A little odd for a small-time hood whose M.O. involves velvet capes!
But that's not the worst part.  There are a variety of weirdly played scenes involving Jon Lovitz as a two-faced loser or something to that effect.  Lovitz acts a clown one moment, but then breaks down and cries the next.  Unfortunately, not for an intended comic effect.  Why is he crying and delivering a ""woe-is-me"" monologue?  Who knows?  The movie just introduced his character, so nothing in the so-called script was built-up to prepare us for it.  This is typical of the entire movie, though, which introduces characters without any explanation to what's going on.  And then they disappear right after that!
But this is an action film, right?  It should have that going for it.  Wrong.  They can't even get that right.  Most of the sequences are too shoddy and strangely choreographed to make out.  And at two and 1/2 hours, it's way too long.  Unless you're a masochist, avoid 3000 Miles at all costs!",1004659200,6,1958,4.710914454277286

Watching Kurt Russell suit up again as Elvis was pure magic, as was his little music video during the closing credits.
Kevin Costner with a bow and arrow in his hands again obvious and trite.  On the other hand, Costner makes a delicious villain, and his blaze of glory exit toward the end of the film, with Elvis singing ""My Way"", was a stunning marriage of images and music.
Jon Lovitz makes every performance shine.
Christian Slater's role was far smaller than I would have liked for it to be.

The screenplay for this mindless mayhem is horrendous, and one can only wonder what kind of blackmail was used to get Costner and Russell to agree to appear.  The story isn't just weak, it is absurd.  The dialogue is nauseatingly bad.  Most B movie producers would have burned this script after reading about five pages.  How it managed to procure a $62 million budget is a wonder of modern filmmaking.
Writer/Director/Producer Demian Lichtenstein seems so intent on presenting graphically violent images without regard to plausibility that he completely incinerates any vestige of credibility the screenplay might have contained.  Lichtenstein shows promise with some effective camera work and generally good cinematography, but these skills without the slightest understanding of storytelling technique, continuity and actor direction make him better suited for a return to shooting commercials and music videos from whence he came.  The music by George Clinton is awful, again below B movie standards.
The acting is mediocre, although even brilliant performances would have been wasted on this script.  Kevin Costner, a paragon of good guy roles, attempts to play a badder-than-bad super sociopath, and while it is a decent performance, the character is so one dimensional that it allows for no nuance.  This combined with Costners having to force himself to overcome his naturally nice demeanor makes the character extremely unbelievable.
Kurt Russell doesnt fare much better.  He does his best to portray his character as a hard boiled criminal with a soft heart, but comes off as too much of a sap, doing obviously stupid things repeatedly because he cant resist the charms of the scheming Cybil (Courtney Cox) and her underhanded kid (David Kaye).  Christian Slater, David Arquette, Jon Lovitz, and Ice-T are thrown in just to beef up the celebrity body count.

1622345,5,B00005LDDB,"Wow....where do I start, here? Well, I had pretty high expectations for this one. I was really excited about seeing Costner play the bad guy and he did one hell of a good job. It was a blast watching him bully his way around on-screen. He's taken so much flak from the critics these past few years, it's almost like this was his ""F**k You"" to everyone who's given him such a hard time. I mean, the guy put his heart and soul into such projects as ""The Postman"" and ""For Love of the Game"" only to have it trampled over by the same people who were praising his work in ""Dances With Wolves"" a decade ago. This was a refreshing change of pace for him. Kurt Russell id pretty well in an underwritten part. I really don't know why he got top-billing when we spend more time following Costner's badass character. Russell still got some pretty funny lines, though. I'm sure they both had a blast playing the part. I know I would've enjoyed it. This film has almost as many actors as ""Jay and Silent Bob"", usually in brief cameos, but I'd say a dozen big names drop in for a special appearance. Christian Slater was great (it would've been great had he been given a bigger role) as one of the Casino robbers. His lines were also quite funny and I think he took the part because it was so similar to his role as Clarence in ""True Romance"".
Let it be known that this is not a ""thinking man's movie"". Those going in expecting to be intellectually challenged would be better off catching ""Memento"". This is an action movie plain and simple and it's a damn good one at that.",1000080000,3,1560,4.309523809523809

Kurt Russell was okay (he's starting to show his age a bit), and I enjoyed Courtney Cox's trailer park ingenue a lot...but the reason to see this movie is, believe it or not, Kevin Costner.
The best comparison I can make to this radically-against-type casting of him in this movie is when Henry Fonda put on a black hat for Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". You just don't expect to see a typically romantic lead in role like this. And Costner nails it with a vengeance. He smokes. He steals things. He kills more-or-less everything in his path. Worse still for these politically-correct times, he drinks and drives and fills out sex questionnaires in magazines. He really makes this otherwise cookie cutter action flick work. The film itself will serve to provide additional ammunition for Costner bashers everywhere (you know who you are), but that's unfortunate, because his performance here is absolutely outstanding.

1622353,3,B00005LDDB,"3000 MILES TO GRACELAND (2001, R= Strong Violence, Strong Profanity, and Sexual Content, including Sexual Dialogue) The Cast: KEVIN COSTNER, KURT RUSSELL, COURTENEY COX ARQUETTE, CHRISTIAN SLATER, JON LOVITZ and DAVID ARQUETTE. The Genre: ACTION/CRIME The Plot: Five thieves pull off the ultimate heist at a casino in Las Vegas dressing up as Elvis impersonators, but soon realize that their gang leader (Costner) is trying to keep all the money himself, leaving one man (Russell) to stop him. What Works: Action to the extreme, which could never be re-created any better- unless they added more to the film. And Kevin Costner's perfect role as the ultimate villain. What Doesn't: This film has nothing much to do with Elvis other than the fact that they dress up as Elvis impersonators to snatch some cash, and that Costner gets p/o'ed when someone says ""The King is Dead."" The sexual content was way too out of line and has nothing to do with the film's potential- it only departs from it. Also, the in-between sequences when the action is over- it really just drags out the film. If you take the Vegas shootout, the action-packed end, and the battling scorpions in the beginning- then that is really all the action you get. There isn't enough momentum to keep the film going smoothly. Reality Check: To add to its major cliches- the media is trying to get a very ""Bad"" message to the audience, especially to young kids: CRIME IS KING. The Catch: You will be entertained with action, but the in-between stuff is just nothing worth the hour and twenty five minutes. OVERALL: ""This high-octane action films busts metal bars in half with its extreme action and ultimate villain, but fails in the areas of being entertaining the whole way through and giving the audience a positive message.

After the heist Michael plans to take off on his boat and retire. But things are never as easy as they sound. It turns out that Murphy is a little less sane than Michael remembers and things soon get out of hand big time. Michael is thrown into a ""kill or be killed"" world where he has to decide who to trust and what is really important.
  My Opinion:  This is a dark over the top action movie that I enjoyed. I wasn't expecting it to be so action packed or so dark, but then I try not to watch the trailer or read plot descriptions before hand so that nothing gets spoiled for me. Both Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner are excellent in this film. They play ""bad guy badder guy"" and this worked for me. Even though Russell plays a criminal, he's not as bad as the rest of them and we end up rooting for him. Courtney Cox is very different as the very annoying Cybil who just won't shut up.  There is an Elvis theme that runs through the entire movie, hence the tittle. It's easy to miss if you are not watching closely. The scorpion from the opening credits also shows up again, so watch closely. There is a good amount of dark tongue in cheek humor, so you have to be able to catch on to this because there is no laugh track. If you fail to catch on to this, the movie won't be as enjoyable and you may end up not liking it at all.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1, DD5.1. The only extras are the trailer and a brief cast and crew list. This is a pretty sparse DVD release.
What You Should Do:  See it if you are into dark action packed crime movies. It's extremely violent and tongue in cheek at times but it's an enjoyable ride for fans of the genre.

Soon there is a casino heist with bullets flying all over the place, but none of that matters, what matters is the midget Elvis impersonator, he gets killed and I'm sure that  I found that much funnier than I should have.

Throw Kevin Costner into the mix and you add a bit of legitimization. Kurt Russel and Courtney Cox in the lineup and you know that the producer really stood behind this project, no matter how Tarantino-esque things are about to get.
In order to enjoy a movie we are supposed to slip into a state of suspension of disbelief as we are watching the film. How deep and how long we stay in this state is porportional to how well we enjoy the movie. It's an easy formula, but it is one that is often blown and disrupted by various amature factors at work in the movie industry. Although this movie has some interesting assertions and it is definately an extreme story - it is not so crazy that it slips into the ""only in the movies"" category.
Costner made the casino robbery seem not so over the top, despite the music video director's turn at the wheel. There were a lot of bullets, a lot of action and yet the band literally played on.
I am not used to Costner as the bad guy, and sometimes that means that the role is awkward and the actor is just trying to prove he is versatile. Not with Kevin, he was very believable as the intense and dark leader of the doomed pack.
Courtney Cox delivered a good performance and looked incredible. She pulled out a sexy side you don't see in her too much and went a lot furthur than her husband (also in the movie) or you would believe in her scenes with Kurt Russell.
I enjoyed this movie and will recommend it to anyone who likes a good action/robbery movie with an interesting story. It does not break any new ground (Hollywood formula = plan the crime, do the crime, watch back end of plan fall apart, hero character squeezes the lemons and makes lemonade with whats left) but it does entertain.
What adds depth to this movie is the backstory and the smart duo of Courtney Cox and her son. Blind bad luck strikes them a blow at every turn and with sharp wits and good timing they keep turning the odds back in their favor.
The Elvis tie in that this movie  exploits is actually fascinating and very plausible. I love a movie that makes me think about situations in real life after I have watched the film and this is one of those.

I put the DVD into my player and ran the movie. To my surprise, I find 3D animation of 2 scorpions fighting which kind of made me raise an eyebrow towards the lack of correlation between the movie and the animation. Nonetheless I started watching the movie. To my suprise, most of the favorites in this movie were not even given ""significant"" parts. You will come to learn of what I mean by this when you watch the movie. In my mind, I was thinking this movie would be about 5 guys planning and scheming a big casino heist in Las Vegas during some Elvis convention. Guess What?! The heist is only 4-5 minutes at the max. The actual movie is more about laundering the money and how the money keeps changing hands. So basically you have to guess who is going to keep the money. The only half decent actor/actress in this movie was Courney Arquette, who played a somewhat decent ""whorish"" single mother.  Putting it all together, 3000 Miles to Graceland, kept fumbling around with different ideas and character developments, yet failed to completely let the ideas and development flow through the movie.

1622377,3,B00005LDDB,"3000 Miles to Graceland isn't quite as dopey as the cover art featuring Kurt Russell and Kevin Kostner clad in Elvis regalia would suggest.  Although it breaks little new ground in its already overworked genre, the film does emerge as an efficient crime drama thanks to a gallery of interesting characters, some impressive performances and Demian Lichtenstein's flashy directorial style.
After a shaky first half hour or so, in which the film seems to be struggling to establish its direction and tone, the movie miraculously hits its stride and, thereafter, never really lets up.  The story centers around a band of ex-cons, united by their almost obsessive love for the King of rocknroll, who decide to knock over a Las Vegas casino dressed as Elvis impersonators.  Predictably, the heist serves merely as the pretext for one of them, the obviously psychotic Murphy (Kostner), to cold-bloodedly eliminate his accomplices.  The fly in his ointment turns out to be Michael Zane (Russell), the most principled one of the group, who survives the holocaust and spends his time, along with a pretty single mother and her precocious child, trying to keep out of Murphys way.
In terms of plotting, the film follows a pretty traditional route for this kind of film.  However, the characters here seem a bit more fleshed out than they often do in some of those other films, particularly Zane, who seems caught between his criminal inclinations and his innate goodness as a human being.  Cybil, the single mother played by Courteney Cox, likewise seems conflicted between genuine love and emotion and the excitement of easy wealth and a life lived on the edge.  But it is Kostner as Murphy who sets the real tone for the film.  His portrayal of a steely-eyed psychotic killer literally sets the teeth on edge, as he callously mows down scores of policemen and innocent bystanders who happen to get in his way.  He makes for a truly soul-cringing villain.  Russell, who played the actual legend back in his own younger, more halcyon days, makes a fascinating subtle counterpoint to Murphys unbridled ruthlessness.
The film is not, however, a total success.  For one thing, the violence often seems excessively brutal, graphic and mean spirited for a movie that seems to want to be a lark of sorts (after all, a movie featuring robbers dressed as Elvis impersonators cant be bidding to be taken too seriously).  Moreover, the plotting, which far too often relies on unlikely coincidences to keep it rolling, also borders frequently on the incoherent.  Finally, the morally ambiguous ending doesnt really sit well with those of us who find a couple of thieves, no matter how charming they may appear to be, unlikely candidates for heroism in the context of a happy ending.
All in all, however, 3000 Miles to Graceland will probably appeal to those who like their crime dramas offbeat, quirky and filled with interesting characters.",996883200,9,2919,4.981481481481482

I guess I just don't see criticizing a movie because of an erroneous assumption, when the movie is GOOD. I mean, damn good. Kurt Russell, in not his first stint as Elvis (or in this case, an impersonator for the sake of a robbery) is wonderfully understated and kind of the calm during the storm in this movie. The storm? That would be Kevin Costner, who plays the baddest bad man of his career, I dare say. With all of the romantic hero roles he's played, this role goes a long way in showing the many talents of this actor. How he could be so bad and yet, likeable, is amazing to me. Courtney Cox has the trashy-sex-kitten-with-a-good-heart thing going on, and her son is too wise for his years in a realistic, yet sad, way. Yes, this movie has some violence. Is it more violent than other movies? Well, yeah, if you're talking about Bounce, it does. The point is, this movie is immensely entertaining, and never boring. And that's what movies are all about, yes?",993168000,47,1047,4.515789473684211
1622383,3,B00005LDDB,"The title of this movie is pretty misleading although you'll get the joke at the end.  If you're expecting lots of Elvis related plot twists based on the movie's trailers, you'll be disappointed.  There's a small portion of the movie that hints at some Elvis related plot twists but the film doesn't do anything with them, leaving you asking ""Why include them to begin with?""
Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner are both pretty good and the beginning and ending action sequences of the movie are pretty entertaining.  But the middle of the movie just becomes random and disorganized and prevents the plot from going anywhere.
When I think about it, 3KMTG really is like most other action movies with some shootouts and some thrills and spills.  Its entertaining but doesn't really stand out in my mind against similar action movies.  I'm not a big Elvis fan but I was looking forward to more Elvis related plotlines.
You may or may not like it.  IT'll depend on how picky you are about action flicks.",991612800,,995,4.722543352601156

7943924,3,B00005LDDB,While in Las Vegas for an Elvis Impersonator convention.  A gang of thieves rob a casino dressed like Elvis impersonators.  Then try and get a way.  The movie is pretty violent.  And Kevin Costner is someone to not mess around with.  Kurt Russell does look a lot like Elvis.  This is  a good movie that is worth watching every once in awhile.,1522454400,,342,4.419354838709677
