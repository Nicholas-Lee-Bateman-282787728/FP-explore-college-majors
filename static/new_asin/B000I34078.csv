No stupidity; hints, hot chicks, story developing to strange end etc. Perfect. Sure, budget restrictions and censorship are visible, well, nobody stops me from making better movie, right? Some hints kinda really, really freaking. Excellent. If you really want movie try internet.",1373068800,,433,5.2898550724637685
