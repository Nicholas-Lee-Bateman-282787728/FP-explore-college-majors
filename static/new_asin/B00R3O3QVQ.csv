8693954,5,B00R3O3QVQ,"I'm unsure as to why this review is NOT showing up as a Verified Purchase.  I bought it through Amazon as a Lightning Deal on Dec 30, 2016, yet Amazon refuses to acknowledge it as a Verified Purchase even after several attempts to get clarification.

Grainy and muddled speech, but oh, so good. As a kid of the 60s, being an astronaut was probably the coolest thing there was. ANYBODY could be a president - they have 'em all over the world. But being an astronaut? THAT was nearly impossible. These were REAL heroes. They weren't in it for the money and probably not the fame either. They did it because it could be done.

The NASA Collection is a collection of three discs with about 3 episodes per disc. The information presented has been out for years but this is a one-stop-shop for all things early space exploration.  Some of the video used I've never seen before which makes it even better to me.  Actual astronauts speak about the missions they were on. Guest presenters weren't just run of the mill either. They were the Hollywood elite.

It is this worth it? Oh, HELL YES!",1486252800,2,1083,4.5

8693957,1,B00R3O3QVQ,"VERY POOR QUALITY BOTH SOUND AND VIDEO. A BUNCH OF 1st graders must have digitized the films and then used the same public sound bites over and over.
Could believe that NASA would allow their name to be associated with anything this awful!!!",1480982400,2,241,4.627906976744186

8693960,5,B00R3O3QVQ,"The film quality may not satisfy videophiles nor the audio audiophiles but the as someone who grew up with the space program on the nightly news the videos are a walk down memory lane. The videos are also an important historical record of America's space program and they are a welcome addition to my collection of science videos. The production  and presentation styles are reminiscent of U.S. Armed Forces training videos of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.",1457395200,12,455,4.909090909090909
