8679484,5,B00NO9ODK2,This is such an important movie!!  A real must see for anyone who loves animals and doesn't want to see them suffer.,1474502400,,116,4.2727272727272725
8679485,5,B00NO9ODK2,"Excellent video. I bought this to help educate what declaw is, what it does and what Vets don't tell their patients. I have found that most people don't realize that it is an amputation of the cats toes not just the claw itself. Helping people understand instead of shaming them gets your point across much better. My prayer is that the America will follow suit with most other European countries and ban this procedure.",1472774400,,420,4.6891891891891895

8679487,1,B00NO9ODK2,This documentary is awesome! But the sender sent me a dvd loose in the packaging and it sounds like it's in more than one piece. I'm only guessing because I haven't even opened it. I need to replace it!,1466208000,,202,4.205128205128205
8679488,4,B00NO9ODK2,"I liked the video overall. I do not feel that it's intent is to povide a balanced view (pros/cons) of declawing cats nor does it offer solutions that may obviate the need for declawing. This is clearly a video that is meant to dissuade owners from the ostensible barbaric practice of declawing. If the viewer keeps this singular focus in mind, then it's a well-presented, parochial and persuasive piece.",1441152000,,403,4.855072463768116
