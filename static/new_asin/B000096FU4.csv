1879640,5,B000096FU4,"Throughot my life as a Russian history buff, I was surprised at how no one managed to make a decent documentary about Russian History. Countless documentaries (like Nicholas and Alexandra, Nova, The Revenge of the Romanovs) but they all left a hole in the story, until now...
I was browsing when I decided to visit the History Channel website. And Russia: Land of the Tsars was being advertised in the spotlight with contests etc and trailers. I was anxious to watch it (although I was expecting a disappointment like other documentaries). So I reserved the TV and watched it. It was stunning because it was a mix of movie quality acting, interviews with experts and informative narration.
The problem with many documentaries was they would ignore minor tsars/ tsarinas and my personal favorite (apart from Nicholas II) Tsarina Elizaveta Petrovna. But not this one they comprehensively explained personalities and showed an array of portraits of the sovereigns and re-enacments of important events. When the first part finished (at the end of Pyotr the Great's death) I couldn't wait till the next day for the continuation, it was so enchanting I did not want to leave the Land of the Tsars, but I waited till the next day when I watched the continuation (even more dazzling). Ekaterina the Great's affairs, Pyotr III's murder, The Napoleonic Wars, they were all re-enacted, I was stunned. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in Russia and expects up to date information and rich production.",1054339200,6,1500,4.9800796812749

It was so good that I was excited to put in the second disc, however, the second disc is not in the same format and it consists of three biographies {Peter the Great, Rasputin, and another}  but for one, Peter the Great was covered in the first disc and its disappointing that it doesn't include the history from the 1725-1900s in the same format as the first disc.",1393632000,,503,4.340425531914893

1879648,4,B000096FU4,"""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" was a librsry purchase, for one of the Sisters Of Saint Joseph Libraries. Russia is one of the world's ""Bridge Countries"". It is situated between the continents of Asia in the East, and Europe in the West. With a landmass of over six million square miles, Russia is the largest nation on earth, according to territorial boundaries. Russia spans from China and Kazakstan in the East, to Finland and Poland in the West. Considered a part of East Asia, Central Asia, and Europe, Russia is considered one of the most pivotal nations in the world. Since the 1500's Russia has played a huge role in world history, and will most certainly do so in the coming centuries. A study of Russia, is critical in being able to make sense of and understand, our modern world. Most of the 20th Century was overshadowed by the Bolshevik Revolution, led by Vladimir Lenin, that took place in Russia, in October of 1917. ""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" is an excellent tutorial study of Russia, it's formation as a nation-state, it's history, and it's culture. ""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" is a 2003 educational presentation over five hours long, produced by Partisan Pictures for ""The History Channel"". It comes in two volumes, and tells the story of the people and nation of Russia. Volume One runs over three hours, and it is an intricately detailed outline of 1000 years of Russian history, from the 900's to the 1900's. Volume Two of ""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" runs just under three hours. It is a collection of documentary film biographies of Ivan IV (The Terrible), Peter the Great, and the Monk who had great influence over Nicholas II and his family, Rasputin. Also included is a timeline of one thousand years of Russian rulers and history. The introduction of Volume One accurately identifies Russia as the multi-cultural land of EurAsia, with the Russian people comprising ethic groups of East Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Northern Europe. This vast land was and is, tied together by a network of rivers, rivers that by 1100, had led to the development of a cluster of city-states. At this time, Kiev was the leading city-state of Russia, and the Russian people were led by Prince Vladimir of Kiev. Prince Vladimir of Kiev will become an Eastern Orthodox Christian, and soon the whole Russian nation will become primarily Eastern Orthodox Christians. By the 1200's Russia will again be ruled by Mongolia, and this Mongolian rule will last until the 1400's, when Prince Ivan III of Moscow, will raise an army that expels the Mongolians from Russia. With Ivan III's victory will come the emergence of Moscow as the capital of Russia. Ivan IV (The Terrible) will lead the building of Russia, into an immense world empire and power, one of the world's largest. By the early 1600's the Romanov dynasty will begin. It will last until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Under the Romanov Tsars, Russia will be maintained as a leading world empire and power, but the Romanov Tsars will place the Russian peasants into serfdom (slavery). The Russian peasants will become the legal property of the nobles who own the land, the peasants work on. Serfdom will haunt the Romanov dynasty from it's beginning in 1612, to it's end in 1917. By the early 1650's Peter the Great will begin to rule Russia. Peter the Great will begin a process of making Russia a nation of both Asia and Europe, with one foot in the East and the other foot in the West. Peter the Great will build a second capital city of Russia, St. Petersburg, along the Baltic Coast. St. Petersburg will be a capital port city along Russia's western borders with Eastern Europe and Scandinavian countries. This new city will give Russia both a ""window"" to the West, and a firm foothold in Europe. By the 1740's, Peter the Great's daughter Elizabeth will become Empress of Russia. By the 1760's, Elizabeth's daughter in-law Catherine, will become Russia's second Empress. Catherine the Great will extend Russia's southern borders to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea Coasts. Catherine the Great will also build schools and universities across Russia. Also, it should be mentioned, Catherine the Great initially favored freedom for the serfs, but the Russian economy was built on the labor of the serfs, and it was believed by the ruling class of Russia, the land owning nobles, and later Catherine herself, that the Russian society and economy would collapse, if the serfs were freed. Catherine the Great is considered one of the greatest monarchs of the 18th Century. By 1801 the Tsar of Russia is Alexander I. Alexander I will repel Napoleon Bonaparte's 1812 invasion of Russia, and ultimately end Napoleon's reign as Emperor of France. Alexander I will be succeeded by his younger brother, Nicholas I in 1825. Nicholas I will immediately face an attempted coup by a group of Russian military officers. Nicholas I will act decisively, and insist on absolute rule. In 1855, Alexander II, the son of Nicholas I, will become Tsar of Russia. Alexander II will be known as, ""The Tsar Liberator"", famous for his speech in which he said, ""Either we emancipate the serfs from above, or they will emancipate themselves from below"". Alexander II emancipated the Russian serfs in 1861. The serfs will be liberated, but they will face many difficulties. Peasants now had to purchase land from land owning nobles, at very high prices, being placed under great financial hardship. Russian agricultural output was drastically reduced, and the Russian economy was close to collapse. In many segments of Russian society, there was great anger towards the Russian aristocracy. In 1881 a squad of assassins and suicide bombers, led by the daughter of the governor-general of St. Petersburg, will assassinate Tsar Alexander II in the streets of St. Petersburg. In the wake of his father's assassination, Alexander III will become the Tsar of Russia. Tremendous economic growth and a rapid industrialization of Russia, will transform the country from an agrarian society, to a land of both agriculture and industry. Railroads and factories will be built, and a new Russian urban, working class will arise, as peasants leave the countryside and stream into urban centers. Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev, and the provincial capitals will all experience great growth, at times coming close to overwhelming these cities, and taxing their infrastructures. In 1894, Nicholas II will become the last Romanov Tsar of Russia. The beginning of the end of the rule of Russia by the Romanovs, will come during 1904 and into 1905. Nicholas II will attempt to enlarge the Russian empire by annexing territory from China and Korea. Japan will then intervene with a declaration of war, and Russia will suffer a terrible naval defeat. The Russian navy, built by Peter the Great, will be completely decimated. Nicholas II, will never again be able to gain the trust and confidence of the Russian people. Later in 1905 there will be factory shutdowns and work stoppages. Large numbers of working poor; urban factory workers, rural peasants, and miners will begin to gather in the streets of St. Petersburg. Every facet of Russian society; the Russian aristocracy, the intelligentsia, the entrepreneurial and business class, urban workers, and rural peasants will all lose faith in the leadership of Tsar Nicholas II. In 1914 Russia will be drawn into World War I. Initially, Russians will be enthusiastic about the Russian war effort. Then, as the number of Russian soldiers captured, wounded, and killed soars to eight million, and shortages of food and fuel bring starvation and economic ruin at home, support for Russian involvement in World War I, among the Russian people, will dissipate quickly. In February  and March of 1917, after three years of war, long lines of people waiting for bread, will turn into wild and serious disorders on the streets of St. Petersburg. This chaos on the streets of St. Petersburg, will itself quickly become a revolution. Nicholas II will lose the support of the police and the military, as they refuse orders to use force to disperse the crowds. Nicholas II will abdicate, and will sign all governing authority over to the Russian legislative body, the Duma. This general revolution in the spring of 1917, will itself be overthrown by the Bolshevik Revolution in October of 1917. In the end, the Romanov dynasty was simply unprepared for the societal and economic changes that occurred in Russia, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" is an excellent educational resource, outlining ten centuries of Russian history; from the rising of Kiev and Moscow as cities in the 900's, to the Russian Revolution of 1917.  I hope this review of ""Russia- Land Of The Tsars"" has been helpful. Janet Saccardi- UnityReconciliationRadio",1371686400,4,8825,4.966193373901285
1879649,5,B000096FU4,"Has short summaries of each important Tsar in Russian history.  The DVD really glosses over each one so if you are already familiar with this subject, you may want to pass on this.  For the rest of us who don't know much about this subject, this is a good overview.  The documentary is a little old so this is in standard def if that bothers you.  The re-enactments have no dialogue and are simply the key figures moving through on scene locations.  If you are like me, I hate the new documentaries with hokey re-enactments.  This older show is not that bad.",1371168000,2,558,4.421568627450981

1879655,4,B000096FU4,"All in all this is a pretty good over view of the Tsar timeline, and decent outline of the development of Russian history in general. Sure, it relies too heavily on ham handed reenactments, but what are you going to do? Put a still image of a portrait of Catherine the Great on screen for 90 seconds as you lay in a voice over? There just are not a lot of surviving interviews on film or tape of Ivan the Terrible or Peter the Great. You can blame the Nazis if you want to. It would have been nice to have a few more English speaking Russian historians who were actually Russian talking about the various subjects, and it would have been nice to have more footage from the actual environs there in Russia, but I suspect they had a budget to adhere to. Too bad. Again, it is a good over view, but it is not a ""spectacular"" game changing documentary of the kind that Ken Burns takes on. Sure wish he would turn his gaze east though, might be fun...",1358726400,4,946,4.2032967032967035

1879660,3,B000096FU4,"This program comes in two volumes and different productions so I'll review both separately because they are way different from one another.

Volume 1
DVD 1 has two parts of approximately 90 minutes each. It covers the Romanov family from the 1500s to WWI. The information is good but differs a little from history books I've read but the production part is very bad. The sound is horrible, the reenactments are terrible. They try very hard not to show the faces of the actors so you are mostly watching the ground and people's legs moving around. It gets very annoying after 15 minutes of this and the footage is very repetitive also. It will only get better when the history reaches the early 1900s and that is at the end of Part 2 and they use real footage of that era.

Volume 2
DVD 2 is done by A&E Biography and is of much better quality. There are 3 biographies of approximately 45 minutes each. They cover Ivan The Terrible, Peter The Great and Rasputin The Mad Monk. The sound is still bad but the reenactments are way better and real footage is used whenever possible. They do show the actor's faces and that makes it much better to watch. This volume deserves 5 stars but not volume 1 and that is why I gave it 3 stars.",1351123200,,1229,4.385964912280702
1879661,4,B000096FU4,"I did not buy the series on Amazon, but I received it via Netflix.  My family enjoyed it very much, but then again they know very little about Russia.  It is quite entertaining, and touches on all the biggest topics - while making it interesting enough and exciting enough to keep watching for 3 and a half hours.  That alone gets it four stars.  A lot of the footage is fantastic - even shockingly good.  It is a History channel documentary, and it is definitely not completely accurate in every respect.  For example there is a lot of subjective emotionalism included for dramatic effect, and a lot of guessing as to what was the emotional state of mind of certain historical characters.  Sometimes events seem to be really crowded together when in fact they unraveled over a length of time, and most of the characters are very two-dimensional and the opinion of them is imposed from a very western point of view.  Very little real time is spent examining Napoleon's invasion and the aftermath, at least... less time than was spent on Narodnaya Volya and the assassination of Alexander II.  In short, this is a great documentary for everyone, but for someone who knows a lot about the History of Russia, it might be a bit lightweight.  If you are interested in the topic, it is still very worth the time spent watching it.",1348531200,3,1324,4.619658119658119

This was supposed to be a 2 disc DVD on my favorite documentary. I have seen the documentary on TV several times before, so it wasn't urgent for me to watch it as soon as I received it. Today I put the second disc in, and discovered that it was not the correct DVD. Funny that the disc has the correct documentary title and image on it. I paid for a bootleg DVD. Not only did this seller sell me a bootleg DVD, they didn't bother to check and make sure it was the right bootleg DVD. This frustrates me beyond belief because it happens all too often.

The script is very well written in a nicely dramatic, narrated form interspersed with comments by historians.  It is not a high end PBS or BBC production in terms of re-enactments.  It fits right in with what you see on the History Channel in many ancient history programs done on moderate budgets - there is a repetition of certain camera shots - party scenes to indicate intrique, blood dripping on a floor, horse hoofs galloping across frozen snow - but the detailed and well organized flow of historical events is well done.  It covers several hundred years of dynastic rule, which is no small feat.

It is well worth it for anyone who needs to clarify certain parts of Russian or European history, plus it does an excellent job in bringing to life the in's and out's of an empire.

1879669,3,B000096FU4,"This DVD set is best at giving a general history of the Russian Tsars, and would be a great introduction for someone new to this place and time in history. However, as someone who already knows quite a bit about Russian history, not many new things are presented here, and I've even noticed a few errors, such as the creators using a picture of Ivan the Terrible holding his dead son to represent the victim of a completely different Tsar. And being the History Channel, you can expect the theatrical music and tone to bias you toward feeling one way or another about a certain person or event, as opposed to giving you the facts and leaving it at that.

One of the most disappointing things, however, was the lack of speakers, specifically ones from Russia. All but two or three (in the five episodes on the set) are from the US or UK, and most of those are from less than known Universities. It feels like they were simply there to give the narrator a break at times, since most information is given from the voice over. The reenactments were also disappointing, because many scenes were used over and over, becoming repetitive very fast. The three episodes on the second disc (Which were specifically based around Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Rasputin) didn't have much more information than the two episode series on the first disc. In fact, the only one where anything new or different was presented was the Rasputin episode, and that's only because he wasn't a Tsar.

Despite these numerous flaws, this set is good for what it is, and stays focused on the topics presented. I wouldn't necessarily recommend purchasing it because you could easily find all the information online or in a book, just without the mostly mediocre reenactments.",1316563200,2,1755,4.713355048859935

""Power.  Absolute power.  The power to make war or peace.  To suppress ideas.  To transform society.  This was the power of the Russian Tsar.""

The above is told to the viewer in the introduction of the second part of this fascinating documentary that details highlights of the Tsarist history of Russia, the largest country on Earth.  (Tsar means ""Caesar"" in Russian.)

This documentary is divided into two parts.

The first part begins in the ninth century.  It ends in 1725 with the death of a Tsar who was also the first Emperor of Russia.  This first part is 90 minutes long.

The second part begins in late 1741.  It ends in 1918 with the death of the last Tsar of Russia.  This part is also 90 minutes long.

This documentary uses rare source material, historical re-enactments, expert commentary (that is, the narration is interweaved with brief comments by experts in Russian history), and exceptional footage (some in black and white).  There is also fantastic cinematography and photography.

There is a second bonus disc.  It has three biographies from the ""Biography"" television program.  The biographies give more detail of the lives of two people mentioned in the first part and the life of one person mentioned in the second part of the documentary.  Each biography is about 45 minutes long.

As well, on the bonus disc, there is a chart entitled ""Timeline of the Russian Tsars.""  This is an aid to the documentary to help the viewer sort out who was who and who married who.

The documentary was filmed on location in Russia.  The narrator is actor Edward Herrmann.

Finally, be aware that the documentary as well as the three bonus biographies have no subtitles or closed-captioning.

In conclusion, this is an exceptional documentary.  Be sure to view it to discover why Winston Churchhill said the following of Russia:

""It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.""

(2003 {bonus material 1997, 2000, and 1997 respectively}; 180 min {bonus material 140 min};  wide screen {bonus material full screen};  28 chapters;  2 discs; a History Channel presentation)

1879673,4,B000096FU4,"As a teacher, I generally dislike multi-media.  However, I did show my students some excerpts from ""Land of the Tsars"" and they found it enjoyable and informative.

The documentary is ""personality centered/great man"" history, using figures like Ivan the Dread, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great as the mirrors through which Russia shaped itself.  The titanic and paradoxical impact of Peter was especially well-done in very basic language and concepts.  Now, the advanced student of Russian Studies will find this series tiresome - ""same old, same old"" that does little justice to the social and cultural movements that shaped Russia ""closer to the ground.""  And the throne room gossip and sometimes overly dramatic editing (i.e. ""flashes of lightning"" whenever Ivan appears on the screen) can get a little tiring and old.  But one thing especially stood out for me.  The Mongol ""yoke"" (which in many ways was not a ""yoke"" at all) and Russia before the Tsars are covered in a very, very balanced and even handed style (altough with a brevity that does the subject no justice) which takes account of the rethinking that has been occurring slowly in both Russia and the West about the extent of the Mongol cultural contribution.  You would not have found that even as recently as twenty-five years ago. The series generally - and commendably - avoids excessively romanticizing its subjects.

The costuming is very well done, the images artfully chosen, and the soundtrack impressive.  There is little acting in favor of commentary, which is welcome.

Again, this is a basic history, shaped to the limited format of its medium.  But it will keep the audience engaged and interested in a well-done, broadly generaliast overview of the various remarkable men and women of power who created ""Russia"" as we know it, and don't know it.

1879674,3,B000096FU4,"I'm not sure why the History Channel keeps doing this but for some reason they sometimes re-edit their titles for DVD, almost creating a new title in some cases.  I thought this documentary was informative and a good primer into Russian history.  However, for some reason that cannot be explained, this is another edited title.  The most noticeable place was in the Ivan the Terrible segment.  It leaves out the parts on TV that showed the painting of Ivan killing his son (which was the appropriate place) and completely leaves out that it started because he beat his son's pregnant wife and probably caused her miscarriage.  And in one night, he basically ended the line through his beloved Anastasia.  However, it misleadingly acts as if Ivan had no other sons to take over.  My other problem was ethnicity.  Yet again, the History Channel is using heavily made up white actors to portray characters of different ethincities.  In this case, it was Asian.  It made the documentary difficult to watch at times because it was rather insulting.  But overall, the documentary is worth watching.",1240099200,6,1092,4.912568306010929

I came accross this DVD by accident after an exhausting and disappointing search for a ""Cold War"" history DVD package.  My search came up empty under the category...well at least nothing attractive.  I recently viewed the first DVD and did not fall asleep.  Looking forward to the biography segment in the package. Now on to my review of ""Russia-Land of the Tsars"".

PROS:

-General overview ""made easy to understand of a complex history"".
-Covers major players and events in Russian history.
-Good sound track.
-Hollywood style theme ""Thriller""
-Exciting presentation.
-Good narrator.

CONS:

-Lack of Russian born historians and analysts.
-Short on Russian architecture.
-No mention of Josef Stalin.
-No Cold War coverage.
-B movie style renactment scenes.
-Price ""should be under $20""

As a novice to Russian history...overall this was not a bad purchase.  Better if price is under $20.",1214870400,4,961,5.298013245033113
1879680,5,B000096FU4,"I became interested in the history of Russia when I read Robert Massie's books ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" and ""The Final Chapter.""  I wanted to get a broader view of Russian history, and this DVD delivers: Mongol invasions, Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine (the Great), Alexander I, Nicholas II (""the last Tsar"") and all (or most) Tsars in between.  Naturally there can be no in-depth analysis in the amount of time given, but it was interesting to learn about the development of the Russian navy, the railroad, etc.  The first DVD ends with the death of Nicholas II and the imperial family.  It touches on Lenin, but not much; even less on Stalin, and nothing of Russia's leaders since then.  But certainly there are others sources available for those wishing to learn more about ""modern"" Russia.  The second DVD goes into more detail about Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Rasputin.  These documentaries were good, but I would have liked a more in-depth look at Catherine the Great.",1193443200,3,1026,4.895953757225434

1879682,4,B000096FU4,"If you approach this documentary with an understanding of what it does and does not purport to do, you'll probably not be disappointed. This is NOT an in-depth, scholarly history of Russia, nor a detailed examination of the historical forces at work at each major turning point of Russia's history. What is IS, however, is a good, solid introduction to the main themes and threads of Russian history, with an emphasis on the personages (the ""Tsars"") that were in power over the period covered (e.g., Ivan the Terrible, Catherine, Peter the Great, Nicolas II, and others). If you are interested in a general introduction to the country, this is probably not a bad place to start. And because many people don't know much about Russia, it's probably safe to say that this documentary will likely appeal to the majority of potential viewers.

The documentary was developed by The History Channel, and although it is in no way comparable to the premier documentaries created by the BBC, or even PBS, it has generally good production values, a script that clearly presents the content in a coherent manner, and a good narration in Hermann. Yes, there are the typical theatrical ""visuals"" that one often sees in THC productions, but so what? The most important thing is that we get the overall picture, learn basic content, and then are able to visualize it more accurately by watching the period acting, the photo reproductions, and even seeing a few historical clips embedded in the show. The documentary is broken into four separate episodes, each one designed to fit into a typical on-air TV hour block (about 50 minutes).

Perhaps the most impacting aspect of watching this show is realizing the amount of tyranny and despotism these people have endured over the centuries. Learning so helps us to be more understanding, more sympathetic, and perhaps more able to interpret modern Russia's tendencies and behaviors. Russia's history is in many ways a great history, but it is also a history filled with many sorrows and tribulations. It is a history worth knowing. Here's an easy way to get started learning it.",1188950400,,2109,4.938028169014085

1879685,4,B000096FU4,"This 2 DVD set from the History Channel with the soothing voice of Edward Herrmann narrating tells the story of Russia starting in the 1500s and how this collection of varied peoples became a nation.

This tortured land and its citizens have suffered everything including invasions, revolutions, plagues, wars, and persecutions, yet Russian history remains a highly compelling tale.

While full of interesting information about each Tsar (including where the name came from), the documentary suffers from an overuse of the same re-enactment footage over and over.

But my biggest complaint is that it is too focused on the Tsars and ends abruptly with the death of the last Tsar Nicholas in 1918. There is nothing about the tumult in most of the 20th century.  I was hoping for more of a complete Russian history.

It reminded me that nothing imagined on TV or in the movies can compare with real people and events in history, which is why I ended up buying the DVD's.

Covers the entire span of Romanov rule in Russia.  If you're like me and not an aficionado of the Romanov family, it is splendidly interesting the entire way through.

Worst thing:

Signature History Channel problems.  As opposed to the superior PBS documentaries, HS always wants to over-dramatize with scary music or fire burning over the bad guys (they always do that with Hitler.  Come on, it's Hiitler... we know he's bad.  We don't need the blood dripping down the screen or fire). The other thing they do is they get a few clips of some fighting or someone falling to their death or candles blowing out-- and just show them again and again; generically applying the clips to any year in history.

But having said that... at least HS did this when no one else has... and I'm glad they did. It is quite engaging.",1124064000,21,830,4.598639455782313

1879690,5,B000096FU4,"I was looking for an introduction to Russian history to supplement a book that I had read.  I found it in this two-volume DVD set.  The first was exactly that, a tracing of Russian history through the fall of the tsars.  It didn't go that deep, but it was just what I was looking for.  The second DVD, which had several episodes of PBS ""Biography"", was a pleasant surprise to me - I hadn't expected it.  It gave additional insights into Russia's most prominent characters of history, Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, as well as Rasputin.

My dayghter, a college history major, was taking an upper-level course entitled ""The Romanov Years"".  She felt that this DVD set really helped crystallize the basic things for her so that she could more easily understand the more advanced topics in the course.",1094256000,50,805,4.666666666666667
1879691,4,B000096FU4,"I was honestly suprised to see how many reviewers gave negative comments regarding Russia - Land of the Tsars DVD. There are certainly repetitive clips, but I found that overall, the entire DVD was a good introduction for a first time student or someone who wanted a visual history of the Russian Tsars.

I rented the DVD from my library, and watched both volumes on the weekend. There are two DVDs in all, volume one covering the entire history of the Tsars, and volume two featuring stories on Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Rasputin (from Tsar Nicholas II's reign).

The first volume, although it covers such an immense range of material, is done well. Of course, the notable Tsars like Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great are described in better detail. However, I agree that there are rehashed clips, and some of the renactments are merely clips of horsemen banging swords around (with the camera showing closeups of these swords).

Volume two, although about the Russian Tsars, seems dissimilar to volume one in some respects. While Vol. I was done by the History Channel, Vol. II contains episodes from A&E's biography. Thus, there are a few conflicts between the stories on Vol. I and II. For example, Vol. I emphasized Peter the Great's half sister, Sophia, more in the history of his youth. But in Vol. II, you don't get a sense that Sophia was important at all. And although Ivan the Terrible is one of the three figures on Vol. II, there are missing elements to his story that are captured with more depth in Vol. I.

The only thing that really frustrated me was how Vol. II used the

same clips from previous stories. During the Peter the Great's

story, they kept showing the painting of Ivan the Terrible's murder of his son. How does this relate? It obviously doesn't,

and this error diminishes Vol. II's narration and accuracy.

So although I was displeased with some of the things in Vol. II,

I thought Vol. I was done well enough that I could recommend this DVD to individuals without any background in Russian history who were interested learning about the Tsars. Of course, it does more to read about the long, expansive history, but Vol. I can perform a service by getting people introduced and interested in some of the leading figures in Russian history before they get started on a book.",1090713600,19,2347,4.704878048780488

However, I became very tired of the repeated scenes (like the blood flowing on the stone floor or the horse running on the beach of the rivers) over and over again. It became laughable at times. The creators decided to save money by using the same footage repeatedly -- even if hundreds of years had passed. Heck, couldn't they have at least presented a different angle?
If you going to make a movie -- do it right.",1071187200,14,460,4.423529411764706
1879693,3,B000096FU4,"That, sadly, is what stood out in my mind the most as far as quality goes. The ""background"" music plays very loudly, and the narrator, at times, speaks rather softly in comparison. There are no subtitles to help you along, so I often had to put up with blaring (and oddly techno) music in order to hear the narration.
The makers obviously love their historical reenactments, which is all well and good, most of the time. However, they do tend to reuse items repeatedly, and not always in the right places. A painting of Ivan the Terrible holding his son's body is also used to represent Peter the Great torturing his victims. A painting of a mother holding a baby is said to show the births of both Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great's first son. And so on, in several more instances. Well, which is it?
While the documentaries had nothing new to say to me (because I've done extensive reading on the Romanov dynasty), it is a good introduction to Russian history. The A&E Biographies of Ivan, Peter, and Rasputin were also well done. Let's say, 3.5 stars.",1067904000,60,1060,4.554973821989528

1879699,4,B000096FU4,"This documentary is fascinating in its sweep of the complex history of Russia, though the production is not top notch, and relies heavily on poorly filmed re-enactments, mostly of just hands, feet, and horses hooves, and repeated shots of lightning streaking across the sky, or blood dripping on the floor, to emphasize the drama of a scene. It is peppered with interviews with professors and historians, who provide intriguing insights into the methods and habits of the Tsars.
The first tape starts out by giving the lay of the immense land, and the rivers that were the roadways in the early days of this ""nation of many nations"", the Mongol invasions, Prince Vladimir, who was the first powerful leader and brought the people together using religion as the unifying force, and then moves on to the lives of the Tsars.
Visually, the final tape is the best, because it includes extraordinary, rare, early 20th century photos and films, of events like the war with Japan, and personages like Lenin. Perhaps the most incredible, poignant footage is of ""Bloody Sunday"", that shows the peaceful marchers being shot down. Those familiar with David Lean's version of ""Doctor Zhivago"", will recognize this tragic episode of history that was such a memorable scene in the film.
It has an excellent, atmospheric score by Gary Pozner, which has occasional echoes of Moussorgsky and Tchaikovsky, and greatly enhances and adds emotional impact to this documentary. Written and produced by Don Campbell, and narrated by Edward Herrmann, this is an easy way to digest a lot of history, and for those interested in Russia, I also recommend James Billington's superb ""The Face of Russia"".
Winston Churchill said ""Russia is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma"", and watching this documentary helps to shed some light on the puzzle that is the great and beautiful land of Russia.",1054425600,105,1876,5.016025641025641
1879700,3,B000096FU4,"I watched the entire series on TV this week and was really quite impressed.  Besides loving history in general I have an odd niche interest in the Tsars of Russia (yeah for spelling it not czar!).  I especially like the earlier stuff, entirely bored by the time of Nicholas II and the whole end thing. Just a note, Alexander II is actually my favorite because of a book called The Crown and the Crucible by Michael Phillips & Judith Pella--a favorite hold-over from teen years.
Like I said in the title, I loved the idea behind this series. I realize the trend these days to do ""bottom-up"" history aka social history of the common man.  I like that okay but I am very interested also in the leaders, movers and shakers.  Some of the tsars are such larger than life characters who had a lot to do with the direction that the huge Russian empire took in their respective reigns. You can't do history then without mentioning them. Thank you History Channel!
My only problems include some cut corners in beginning title graphics, re-enactment footage run a *few* too many times (at least when watching the whole thing in a row) and a tad too much of a sensationalistic feel to some of the narration.
I do not usually buy dvds of TV series so I can't really say whether this is a good buy or not.  I can say though that the producers/filmmakers of this series did a real good job and kept me hooked for 4 hours without too much trouble at all.",1054425600,11,1438,4.411320754716981
