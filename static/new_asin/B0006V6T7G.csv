I saw that this was the sequel and went for it. I like Please Twins better. I was more into the characters and the story seemed more real life. It is a little out there with the whole 3 orphans with the same picture thing, but it's more realistic than the dude marrying his teacher from outer space. I can't say enough good stuff about this series. It has comedy, drama, and fast paced relationship twists. The animation is good, and so is the voice acting. Most people will probably recognize Johnny Yong Bosch from Bleach, he is the main character. There are also many other high profile voice talents. The love and passion in this series is pretty touching. I absolutely love this series and highly recommend it to any anime fan.",1349481600,,870,4.477987421383648
8043565,5,B0006V6T7G,"Over all I just purchased this anime not too long ago. When I bought the box series I ended up buying volumes 1,3 and 4. I may have missed volume 2 but that will change. In this dvd It talks about the relationships between Maiku and the other two twins. The first episode begins with Maiku and his senpai. His senpai seems to have rather taken a liking in Maiku, but the problem is that he doesn't really reflect the feelings that Tsubaki show for him. We learn alot more about Kousei in this volumn and it turns out that he's not really (...), but a pervert. I wouldnt say pervert, but putting his hand over a girls (...) while kissing just seems like something a guy shouldn't do. Thats low even in my standards. Well anyways after that the two girls decide to take Maiku out on a date or rather something like that. Turns out that Karen and Miina almost break the love alliance, but in the end it all works out for the best. In the last episode we learn about Miina's past and why she has decided to live with Maiku. It really saddens me to have to see a girl go through what she did, but look where it got her. Over all I really do enjoy this type of anime. If you do too then please feel free to look around my reviews. This is a must buy if you are a previous fan of the volume 1 and 2!!!!!",1122076800,2,1296,4.06640625
