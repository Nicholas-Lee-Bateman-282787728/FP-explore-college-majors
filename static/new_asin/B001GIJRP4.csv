3611198,5,B001GIJRP4,Looked good and love kettlebells so I tried it...glad I did.  Very well done and nice easy instruction.,1239235200,,103,4.722222222222222
3611199,5,B001GIJRP4,"I must admit that I bought this workout because I was looking for more traditional kettlebell training. My only experience up to this point was Kettlenetics, which is a good workout, but it's a fusion workout. I was slightly disappointed by the fact that the ab work here did not include Russian Get-Ups, which I have become very good at.... Overall, it's a solid workout, no fusion involved. I really liked the fact that the DVD is broken down into 10 minute segments, which makes it a good ""I'm in a time crunch"" option. I am currently using an 8 pound kettlebell, and have just purchased a 10 pound because the 8 pound is no longer challenging. If you are looking for a good introduction into kettlebells, this DVD will be a great investment!",1238630400,32,745,4.567164179104478
3611200,5,B001GIJRP4,"This is a great DVD and Angie Miller really knows her stuff. My wife and I both use this workout and we both love it. It's good for all levels and is shot very well. Many fitness DVDs look like they were shot by a kid, but this one is pro level all the way. Some may not care about that, but I do. I like quality. One DVD, good for all levels? That's a deal. YOu won't go wrong with this one.",1234828800,20,392,3.7349397590361444
3611221,4,B001GIJRP4,"I've always been a fan of kettlebell workouts - they are ideal for a quick, intense workout at home and will build strength and endurance all over.  I haven't been doing them in over a year since we moved homes and setup the DVD player in a living room that's doesn't have room for exercise.  Luckily I found this video on Amazon Instant Video, which works perfectly with our upstairs guest room equipped with Kindle Fire TV and plenty of space!

The overall workout is great, and at the end of it I was sweating profusely!  I'm an early 40's, heavyset guy - but I do try to workout 3-4 days a week alternating between kickboxing, spinning, soccer, flag football, or those bootcamp-style group classes.  When I can't get to my preferred gym due to a crazy travel schedule or during holidays like now, a home kettlebell workout is perfect and using a fitness video like this one is ideal for motivation.

The video has a short tutorial session that goes over some of the exercises in the video.  They have the basics but do add a small twist to make it more challenging.  Swings with overhead crushes, swings with overhead crushes and body rotation, swings with glute kicks/leg raises, overhead squats, etc.  What's not included are some of the more advanced kettlebell exercises like snatches, Turkish getups, and high pulls.  However, the video does throw in advanced moves like high windmills.  The video itself has ""8 sets"" of 5-10 minutes each.  Each set has 3-4 challenging exercises that will get the heart pumping and the sweat pouring down.  I used a 25-lb kettlebell throughout the video and found that I needed short breaks to catch my breath - no way I could do all eight sets non-stop (although that would be a worth fitness goal).  Another bonus of this video are that there are two exercise demos - follow Angie for default difficulty, and follow Chris (the assistant, who has a permanent smile throughout the video) for slightly easier variants of the same exercise.",1417219200,5,1981,4.7043478260869565

3611223,2,B001GIJRP4,"Thankfully, I've done kettle bell workouts before, so her ""tutorial"" wasn't anything new. However, the video then jumps directly into moves that are like an aerobics dance class with kettle bell moves that aren't at all like in the tutorial. So, there is a big learning curve. Further, it jumps directly into some very twisting motions that include deep bends on the knees that repeat, repeat, repeat.... if you have any knee issues this is not the video for you. If you'd like to not  have any knee injuries because of a workout, this is not the video for you. I could feel my knees shaking (and lunges are a normal part of my workout)

The only reason I rented this was that I was crunched for time and the Jillian Michaels 30-day shred with weights wasn't available free on prime any longer. I usually do her stage one and stage 2 back-to-back every other week or so when I just haven't made it to the gym. Now I know its worth buying for the $9.99 vs this cheaper rent.

And, that gets me to the last point. This lady will put you to sleep. I had to put it on mute and then put on music. Jillian is energetic, encouraging, sometimes growling and others laughing. She is funny and you feel like she's talking to you through the tv. This Tamilee lady was a snore fest flashback to the 80's dance style aerobics often shot with a wide camera angle, like she's just directing a class through some motions.

I really should do the workout again to get my money's worth, but I think I'll pass and look for something else.",1413676800,2,1519,4.375886524822695
3611224,5,B001GIJRP4,"Excellent for all levels, but I do think that a 10 lb kettlebell is too heavy if you are new to the workout. I would suggest starting with 5-7 lbs and progressing from there. The instructor uses 15 lbs and suggest 10 if you are a beginner.
You will not get bored, as you can increase your weights and the moves become more challenging.",1410480000,,335,4.25

3611227,5,B001GIJRP4,I've done 3 different kettle bell workouts and this one by far is the most challenging.  Using a 15 or even 10 lb weight the first few times is a bit optimistic.  The tutorial is a bit misleading as it just goes through the basic moves.  Once you get into the workout it can be a little hard to follow and a bit unexpected.  As with any routine it just take some practice.  Definitely worth it if you want a complete kettlebell workout.,1405036800,,436,4.204819277108434
3611228,5,B001GIJRP4,"I chose this DVD because my wife asked for it for her birthday.  I would never buy my wife an exercise video for her birthday on my own!  Like I say, I like sleeping indoors!  But, that's what she wanted, and was very specific.  So, I found it on Amazon.com.  The purchase was simple, and it arrived by the time advertised, and she started using it immediately after opening it.  She is delighted with the Bootcamp program, and I am once again delighted from doing business with Amazon.com, which has proven to be extremely reliable over many experiences.",1396828800,,555,4.612244897959184

3611230,5,B001GIJRP4,"It is great even for the beginner; although I am beginning with a 5 lb kettlebell vs the 10 lbs, but that will allow me to work up to 10. It is a workout that I don't believe I will ever get tired of.",1394668800,,200,3.5681818181818183
3611231,5,B001GIJRP4,"This dvd is easy to follow.  I've tried the kettlebell workouts with Jillian Michaels as well as Sarah Lurie (Iron core).  I liked those dvd's as well, however, at times, I felt like I could potentially injure myself with parts of J.M.'s exercises.  The Iron Core dvd is solid also but the motions get monotonous.
Power Body: Kettlebell Bootcamp pushes you but not to a point where you might pull a muscle (or somehow lose grip of the kettlebell and having it land in the ceiling).  :)  There's a really nice variety of moves and it definitely gets your heartrate up.",1394150400,,567,4.574257425742574

3611235,5,B001GIJRP4,"I've been doing this workout once a week or so for about a year. It's amazing. It's about a 45 minute workout. She does a lot of strengthening moves but mixes the those moves with a good enough amount of cardio. In fact, there's so much cardio that you still struggle to catch your breath at times and get a good sweat going. I'll also say that I have never done this workout and not gotten sore! It's really done a lot for getting me tone. I use a 15 lb. bell, btw.",1386288000,,466,4.021505376344086

3611237,5,B001GIJRP4,"I got this yesterday and did the entire workout today. I used a 15 # bell with a 10# bell for some of the moves. My first kbell workout was about 4 months ago and I realized after the first workout that you must be careful to use proper form. Don't rush your progress! Use a light bell to learn the moves. That said, I love this workout. It has variety, is broken down into sets with a pause in between, that you could fill with cardio, or use to breath. I was sweating buckets. At 52 I did not find the squats and lunges to be too much, I work into the deeper range of motion after warming up my knees. My goals are fitness and staying injury free. Even a strained muscle really ticks me off, so I go the extra mile to avoid that. Angie's instruction is clear and her sets are well thought out. I feel like I worked every part of my body including my brain. Beginners, go for it. Advanced may need more, you could repeat some sets.",1382659200,,932,4.070652173913044
3611238,5,B001GIJRP4,I would consider myself intermediate level and this really works me hard.  I needed a change from my previous kettlebell workout and this is a great change.,1380412800,,156,4.777777777777778

3611242,5,B001GIJRP4,"Love this work out!  I have done Jillian's kettlebell work out as well as Bob Harper's and was afraid this would not be as intense of a workout.  Rest assured, this work out will get your heart rate up and make your muscles sore in a good way.  I was happily able to do the entire workout straight through.  Not quite as intense as Jillian's kettlebell or 30-day Shred / Ripped in 30 workouts from a ""cardio kick your butt"" perspective, but very effective for building lean muscle and getting your cardio in at the same time.  I am definitely a kettlebell fan!!",1373846400,,561,4.407766990291262

3611248,4,B001GIJRP4,"I enjoyed this kettlebell workout.  It's a little over an hour if you do all the segments but it gets the entire body and you are sweating and feeling it when you are done.  I would say it is maybe more intermediate just because you need some endurance, not because the moves are hard, but you could always do it with a light kettlebell to ease into it.",1365984000,,353,4.176470588235294
3611249,4,B001GIJRP4,"So, I had a friend that got hip to the kettlebell circuit. She was ranting and raving about how awesome it was. So one day, on a whim, I started reading about the benefits of doing kettle bells, proper form, etc etc. All of that lead me to an article that recommended this particular DVD for beginner to intermediate kettlebell users. Well, since I was VERY much a beginner, I decided to give it a whirl.

I read reviews about how the music got on some people's nerves, how her constantly smiling irked them and something else... but I have to say I have no complaints about any of those things. Why? Because I was too busy sweating BUCKETS. I had no idea not doing any formal cardio training (ie, running, Zumba, bike riding, which are all things that I do) in a cool room could still render you sopping wet around the collar. I went through with the instructional video, practiced and felt like I was ready to go.

I went through the whole DVD the first time. I was WO' OUT. Wiped. Like, my husband had to come meet me half-way on the stairs and help me up the rest of the way because my legs checked out on me. But even though it was tough, I felt good the rest of the day. Notttt so much the day after, lol, but a light-weights and abs class was able to knock that soreness right on out.

I can appreciate that when I'm facing the carpet doing pushups, or straining to look up at my kettlebell during one-arm squats or windmills, she's really right there, encouraging you. Letting you know, ""Hey, you may be very out of shape, but this hurts for everyone. You're doing great. Stick with it."" I'm going to work to doing it three times a week for the next few months to try to get my arms toned a bit for summer. Mixing this with Zumba/jogging I'm hoping to see some results soon.

Definite recommend to have in the repertoire for a maintenance day or for a beginner!",1364342400,,1869,4.286118980169972
3611250,5,B001GIJRP4,"I enjoy this workout occasionally as it breaks the monotony of the usual kettlebell routine of Turkish get ups, windmills and swings.
It is  very flexible: could be pretty difficult if using a heavier kettlebell or easy if you want it.

She seems stiff and uncomfortable with herself.",1357084800,,267,4.541666666666667
3611255,4,B001GIJRP4,"This is one of the first kettlebell videos that I tried, and my introduction to Angie Miller.  Overall I was quite impressed with this workout.  I am not sure I would call this a traditional kettlebell workout, more like a kettlebell-lite workout where a lighter kettlebell is more suitable than a heavy one.  With the sheer amount of reps I cannot imagine using a heavier bell.  Angie herself uses 15 pound, I use a 10 pounder though I started with a 7 pounder and my legs were sore for three days.

I have only tried a few other kettlebell videos and those used heavier bells but there were also rest periods in between sets, anywhere from 30-60 seconds.  Each set of exercises was around a minute.  For this workout, each set lasts anywhere from 3-8 minutes.  I think using a heavy bell with this workout would be really tough, but for some sure I am sure it's no problem.  I am in awe of those who can though.

This workout contains many of the standard kettlebell moves, such as double, single and alternating swings, lots of curtsy lunges, deadlifts, figure eights, halos and more.  Every muscle group is worked, including abs, plus there is a cardio benefit to it. While I wouldn't call this workout easy, it's structured in a manner that it's doable.  For me I was surprised to finish it all the way through the first time I did it, but I was using a very light kettlebell.

I use other DVDs for heavier kettlebell work, such as Lauren Brooks and Sarah Lurie.  But for lighter kettlebell work this is a great DVD.  In addition to the workout there is a tutorial that shows the moves, but it does not include all of the moves that appear in the workout.  For that reason I would recommend this DVD to experienced kettlebell users who are familiar with proper form.  With that said, I think Angie Miller is a fine instructor and did a good job with this DVD.  She is joined by Chris who demonstrates modifications for some of the exercises, which I found very helpful.

I didn't care for the setting that much, which is bright pink but that's just a minor complaint.  Aside from being a little bright it didn't take away from the workout.  I thought the music was really good, and I especially liked the cooldown.

Overall, I would rate this DVD 4 and a half stars.  I think it's great!",1355011200,,2292,4.456730769230769
3611256,4,B001GIJRP4,"Amazing work out and really deserving of 5 stars rather than 4, but... Even in this price range, one should expect better production.... and Angie's voice and instructions sorta ""grate"" on you.

Having said that, the results are amazing!

I am a guy. Working out to a female led instructional video requires a bit of a mind stretch.... as well as extra effort to closing the blinds and locking the doors.  Still, I gotta say... Angie delivers.

My heart rate hits the fat burning zone with, seemingly, little effort!  I have energy for hours after the workout.  And the results are visible in 7-10 days!  Seriously, I am use to the heavy weight lifting experience (I can't do it now more!).  At 184lbs (5'10"")I was able to burn 3 pounds (of fat) per week and see definition in the abdominal region in the first 7 days, and I am 50 yeas of age!

With the results I am experiencing with this single $20 DVD, I am not sure I would pay $89 for someone else s ""system""... I may, these Kettle bells are pretty addictive.  But I am not sure I really need too.",1350604800,,1052,4.376288659793815

The only thing that would be great is if the 6 sets had markers you could jump to.  Even if it was just a list of those times in a discription of the tape - it would help a lot when you're just starting out, and you want to split up the routine over two days.",1350604800,,379,3.7848101265822787
3611258,4,B001GIJRP4,"I really like Angie Miller's Kettlebell Bootcamp. It offers a perfect stand alone workout that offers a great mix of cardio and strength training. I do agree with other reviewers that it is pretty leg intensive and you might want to avoid this if you have any knee issues. For the most part, the leg work involves straight forward moves, bending, lunging, and stepping sideways. I do modify the curtsy moves in the first set as it is pretty awkward to do and I was afraid I could twist my ankle. Rather than curtsies in set 1, I just do standard lunges which works fine and is easier on my ankles. You will adjust to the workout and the weight and once that happens you will want to up your weight. I now am doing 25 lbs for everything except the upper body work in sets 5 and 6. I plan to move to 30 lbs.

This is a challenging workout and it had me huffing and puffing very quickly. It's done in sections so sometimes I skip around so I'm not completely spent before I even get to work on my arms or abs!

Also, I agree with one of the other reviews when it comes to using bells over 20lbs I would be careful what moves you chose to do with this video. It's for lighter bells but I think I will keep coming back to it for a long time.",1339977600,,675,4.067669172932331

I don't think the abs workout is long enough. Also, her cues are a little off.

Some of the kettlebell moves are not the greatest for your back, especially to KB swings where you come up on one foot and then the other. She also doesn't remind you to use your hips for powerful KB swings during the workout, and for a novice that doesn't know any better, this workout will not be as effective as it should be.",1339459200,,588,4.017094017094017

I wanted to give kettlebells a shot because I heard they were a good workout tool and I needed some variety. Well, let me just say this DVD did not disappoint. It's a challenge everytime. It's not boring and it pushes you. I would highly recommend this DVD coupled with a kettlebell. It's nice, too, that you only really need 1 kettlebell.

3611267,4,B001GIJRP4,"This is my wife giving her review- I have been doing kettlebell for a few months using mainly Lisa Balah's dvds because I do cardio inbetween her 1-2 minute rest periods so it kind of an interval workout.  I like how Lisa has the Legs and arms separate so I can work on a different body part on different days.  So I was looking for something to do on the days that would kind of give me a good cardio and general weight workout. I reviewed this dvd last night and thought it looked kind of wimpy since they smile through the whole dvd, didn't break a sweat or get out of breath.  HA,HA jokes on me.  I barely made it through the whole thing today.  It kicked my butt!!  I had to take two breaks inbetween to catch my breath.  I gave it 4 stars because if you are a beginner make sure you REALLY know how to do swings.  There is a portion in here that is a swing with a lunge and if you don't know what you are doing you could really hurt yourself.  Otherwise I was physically surprised.",1332806400,,987,4.072538860103627

I recently discovered kettle bells and was doing the Jillian Michael's workout, but it was only 25 minutes long so I was looking for something a little more challenging.  Angie Miller's workout got great reviews so I tried it.  I LOVE it!  It's about 45 minutes and works every single muscle in your body.  It's a no frills video that sticks to the point and keeps moving.  You can adjust the difficulty by using a lighter or heavier kettle bell.  I love this DVD and wish she would do more kettle bell DVD's!",1331510400,2,589,4.339449541284404
3611269,4,B001GIJRP4,"Since early Jan 2012, I've purchased and used several DVD's for kettlebell training. My goal was to develop increased muscle tone. This was the first one I tried and I started with a 10 pound bell.  My initial fitness level was fair.  I had been using an elliptical 2-3x/wk for a few weeks prior using a variety of interval trainings. I was not prepared for the full-body burn this DVD brought and was thrilled immediately about working so many muscle groups in one workout.  For the first week, I focused on just being able to get through the DVD.  I was incredibly sore for 3 days after the first workout.  I tend to overdo a little as I like to be challenged, so I probably pushed a little too hard for the first week. I did the workout a second time on day 3 and after that, I've just had the good muscle stiffness you get after a good workout.

As far as form and technique, I hadn't researched kettlebell training much when I started this DVD.  I thought the DVD tutorial did a decent job of describing the details needed to do the moves safely. I used a mirror and practiced the techniques without weight before starting the workout. That said, there are moves included in the workout that could cause discomfort or injury to some with weak quads or glutes. There are a LOT of squats and lunges in this DVD. If taken slow and with light weight (don't do all the reps at first), your strength builds quickly.  This was the approach I used and at the end of 6weeks, I am comfortable using a 20 pound bell for this workout.  I probably wouldn't go heavier than that, and sometimes go back to 15 pound for upper body stuff and continue to get an awesome workout.  I was doing this workout 2 days/week and trying other DVD's on 1-2 other days.  Now I use this one when I want a good leg workout, so about 1x/week or every other week.  I prefer Lauren Brook's series now for technique and strength building (with the cardio benefits).

The pace of the DVD is fast without rest breaks for 40 minutes.  I definitely got a lot of cardio work from this workout and was shocked at how much strength and tone I developed even after 2 weeks.  I love the stretch at the end with the long hip flexor stretches.

I plan to review all of the kettlebell DVD's I have purchased so far, so check them out too.",1329868800,,2296,4.317016317016317
3611270,5,B001GIJRP4,Ordered for my wife who loves the flexibility of the program in that you can pick one or more 'sets' instead of doing one big long workout or having to skip to the ones you want to do.

3611272,1,B001GIJRP4,I am very disappointed with this DVD.  This is the only kettlebell workout DVD that I've purchased and it is NOT what I expected.  I expected an intense KETTLEBELL workout.  This was more like an aerobics class and BTW hold this kettlebell while you're at it.  Do not waste your money on this DVD.  I was able to put together my own workout using information I found on youtube/online about kettlebell exercises...and my routine is much more enjoyable and energized than this robotic nonsense. I have to give credit to Angie though - she is very fit.  But I doubt she got that way doing THIS particular workout. I guess I'll donate this to the local library so somebody can check it out before wasting their money on it.,1327622400,5,720,4.542635658914729

3611274,5,B001GIJRP4,"I started this workout on Monday 11/21/11, the week of Thanksgiving.  I even completed this workout on Thanksgiving day while visiting my mom.  I just put the dvd and kettlebell in the car and hit the road.  I love the fact that even though this video is over 50 minutes, it never feels as if it's over 50 minutes because the workout is broken down into clearly defined sections.  Here's the rundown of the run time:

Warm Up 4:21

Set 1  4:35

Set 2  5:48

Set 3  8:35

Set 4  3:55

Set 5  8:40

Set 6  4:06

Set 7  3:55

Set 8  3:25

Cool Down 4:20

Total Run Time: 51 min 45 sec

Here's the bad and the good.

Bad:

Volume isn't recorded on a high enough volume.  It is difficult to hear her, & she even has a microphone attached to her shirt.  I changed computers, and the volume got better.  Just be mindful that you will need to keep background noise, i.e. tv, radio, kids to a minimum while working out.

Angie clenches her teeth.  This stood out the first couple of times I did the dvd, but you get used to it after a while.

Bending over to perform the deadlifts.  Based on previous kettlebell dvds that I have completed, I keep my back straight and ""squat"" into my deadlifts.  I am not sure about bending over for the deadlifts.

Good:

Long stretch at the end.  Good over the head lengthening ab work.

You get a good workout that challenges all major muscle groups.

Nice job of verbal encouragement both during & at the end of the sets.

The workout is sectioned off well, so you don't feel as if you have been working for almost an hour.

Great back of arm exercise.

Your form will continue to improve with time.

This is an excellent apartment workout. There is little to no jumping (slight pouncing to do a plyometric squat), so this is really saving me a lot of money in gym fees.  I am already looking forward to purchasing a heavier kettlebell soon (I use a 20 lb kettlebell at present), so that I can continue to be challenged by the exercises.

Surprising:

No Turkish getups or snatches

I was sore after the first 2 workouts, and I continue to be sore sporadically.  I rarely get sore.  In the last couple of weeks, I continue to have soreness, especially as a result of deep squats.  I put on an old pair of pants today, and they are almost too big.  :)

The introduction of exercises that are ""new"" to me even though I have completed more than one other kettlebell dvd, i.e. deep curtsies

Closing notes:

I agree with another poster, Angie and Chris barely break a sweat.  The only sign of sweating is that Angie's hair seems a little droopy at the end of the workout.

I was really sore the first week I completed this workout. The other nice thing is that the instructor carefully goes over each move beforehand so you know what you're doing. Some of the moves involve lunging very close to the floor, so it might be hard for people with bad knees. The only thing I STRONGLY dislike about this video is that there is no section which seamlessly runs all of the moves together without all of the explanations in between, or the breaks between sections. Once I completed the workout for a few weeks, I already knew exactly how to do each move and the wait time between moves and sections became extremely boring. Now I can only get through this workout if I continue doing the previous move while she explains the next move because I get SOOOO BORED waiting for the next move and my heart rate goes all the way down. So I would say, if you're at a good level of fitness and already have a background in kettlebells or dance (where you know how to hold your core and balance etc) you might find this video pretty boring.",1321747200,4,1220,4.450892857142857
3611281,5,B001GIJRP4,"Picked this up just as I was getting into Kettlebells.  I saw it had great reviews, and touted itself as 'intermediate to advanced'

I'd like to state, it's really just 'advanced', with intermediate being under your control on when you give up on the video.

While I'm not out of shape(nor in excellent shape) I didn't finish this entire workout straight-through until I switched to a 10 pound weight.  Up to that point I'd used a 15 pound weight, trying to add a set per week before jumping to the stretch.

I also notice that while I feel the workout the next day, it's 2 days after that I know I'm walking slow and funny.  All those lunges with extra weight - wow you'll feel that for days.

I'm a big fan of the vid.  While the instructor's smile comes off almost artificial at times (no one's that happy sweating this much!) I really have no complaints.

If this is your first dive into the kettlebell, I'd look elsewhere first (Bob Harper kettlebell basics worked great for me).  As a second DVD to your collection, I say go for it. You have the option to do the whole workout at once (pretty challenging) or break it up into 5 sections, about 10 minutes each, then mix and match.  Angie Miller does a great job of telling you what you're going to be doing next so you aren't lost when she switches moves. She is supportive but not annoying.  There is a pretty good variety of workouts and moves used in this DVD that even a skilled kettlebell-er would get a work out from.

My one disclaimer is that I feel she does not do a good job of protecting your back.  Some moves are taught with an almost ""drinky bird"" movement instead of squatting, which Bob Harper teaches for safety. I just substitute his method into her routines.

Final word:  Great for intermediate to advanced, not so great for a total beginner.",1318982400,,1134,4.5245098039215685
3611283,5,B001GIJRP4,"I am an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser.  I don't tend to jump on fitness bandwagons, and so I have been avoiding trying kettlebells for some time now.  However, I could no longer ignore all the rave results about what a great tool kettlebells are, working in particular the core and the back side of the body.  So, after doing a lot of research on form and watching many online instructional videos, I began doing some kettlebell swings with a 15-lb. dumbbell.  My next step was to purchase my first kettlebell DVD, and after more research, I chose this one.

The Main Menu of KETTLEBELL BOOTCAMP offers options for Introduction, Tutorial, Play All, Chapter Selections, and Credits.  Given that I am new to kettlebells, I found the 8.5-minute tutorial segment helpful; in this section, instructor Angie Miller leads background exercise Chris through some of the exercises (e.g., double arm swings, double arm swings with glute kick, double arm swings with leg lift, one arm swings, alternating one arm swings, windmills, overhead squats).  Because I don't yet own a kettlebell (just ordered this one today:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8kg-18-lb-Vinyl-Coated-Kettlebell-by-Kaizen-Athletic-with-DVD/dp/B004ANEA2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8kg (18 lb) Vinyl Coated Kettlebell by Kaizen Athletic with DVD</a>), I did this workout this first couple of times through with a 10-pound dumbbell.  I found the moves to be very doable with my dumbbell, and the weight was definitely heavy enough to give me an intense workout.

Angie and Chris are exercising on a bright, pink-infused set.  They are wearing fitness shoes, which I understand that many kettlebell trainers advise against (I went barefoot, which worked fine).  The workout is well-chaptered, consisting of a warm-up, eight strength sets, and a cool-down.  I have broken down each of the individual segments (along with approximate times) below.

WARM-UP, 4 minutes
Angie starts here with some simple aerobic-type moves such as marches, hamstring curls, and step taps.  She ends with some dynamic stretches for the hamstrings and glutes and also adds in some hip snaps, as these are used throughout the workout itself.  This short warm-up felt like a good preparation for the moves to come.

SET 1, 4.5 minutes
This set begins with double arm swings, and then Angie moves into MANY variations of rear curtsey lunges, adding pulses and a knee lift for balance work.  She finishes with additional double arm swings.

SET 2, 5.5 minutes
This set was my favorite!  Angie slows things down a bit, starting with deadlifts and then moving into a balance move that involves setting down the kettlebell, coming into a knee raise, and lifting the kettlebell back up.  She then performs double arm swings with a glute kick, bicep curls with squats, and finishes with additional double arm swings with glute lifts.

SET 3, 8.5 minutes
Angie starts this set with a 1-arm row performed at several different tempos.  She then moves into a slow rear lunge, adding a Figure 8 with the kettlebell and picking up the pace.  Other moves in the segment include a deep side lunge with a row and a double swing with an overhead crush.

SET 4, 4 minutes
Here Angie begins with double arm swings with a side leg lift.  She then performs windmills, with the option of having the kettlebell high or low.

SET 5, 8.5 minutes
Angie described this as ""the most powerful standing set.""  The set starts with one-arm swings followed by a side squat.  Keeping the kettlebell on one side, Angie moves though a shoulder press, torso twist, overhead squat, and plyometric squat (small side-to-side hop) before repeating everything on the other side.

SET 6, 4 minutes
This is the final standing set.  Angie starts with an alternating single arm swing, then moves into a side tap with a halo (ribbons).  Next are triceps overhead extensions, adding in a knee balance.

SET 7, 4 minutes
For this set, Angie and Chris go down to the floor for push-ups; Chris does the push-ups on her knees, Angie on her toes.  They perform staggered, 2-count push-ups with one hand on the kettlebell.  There is one set of 8 on each side and then a final set of 4 on each side--not too bad, even for someone who hates push-ups like I do. ;)

SET 8, 3 minutes
The final floor set is core work, and it consists of three somewhat Pilates inspired moves.  The first exercise is a crunch in which Angie and Chris hold the kettlebell overhead and then crunch up, placing the bell past their knees.  The second move starts off in an inclined seated position and twists the kettlebell side-to-side (Angie had her feet off the floor, while Chris raised one leg alternately).  The final move was a variation on the Pilates roll-up, with Angie rolling up and lifting the bell to the sky and Chris keeping the kettlebell at her chest.  All of the moves are performed at a relatively slow pace without a lot of reps.

STRETCH, 4.5 minutes
For the stretch segment, Angie begins with a nice held lunge to stretch the hip flexors and hamstrings; I particularly liked that she timed the stretches (45 seconds).  She concludes with a few additional stretches in a standing position.

I clocked the total time for this workout at 50.5 minutes.  The first time I tried it, I only did about half (mainly due to time constraints), yet by later that same day, I could definitely feel the work in my entire body, especially my glutes and inner thighs.  I really liked the variety of moves included here--they were different from my usual strength workouts, challenged my body, yet didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed or wiped out.  Not only was this my first kettlebell DVD, but also it was my first DVD with Angie Miller, and I liked her a lot:  she cued very well (with mirror cuing), and came across as both warm and professional.  In the end, I have nothing bad to say about this DVD; I would definitely recommend it!",1315180800,10,5945,4.934607645875252

3611285,3,B001GIJRP4,"I went and looked through lower ratings for this dvd to see what people didn't like about it to incorporate into my review.  Someone posted about this being a very lousy workout dvd because they had knee surgery.  Well yes.  Angie does do some bending of the knees in some of her workouts.  However if you do not have any knee issues it shouldn't bother you.  It says that this is for all levels.  Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.  I would not recommend this dvd for a beginner.  Meaning if you have never EVER really worked out before.  I workout about 2-3 weeks every month and when I would complete a session from this dvd I was breathing heavily and definately ready to be done.  O.k. the music.  It's reminds me of techno.  If you really have a problem with it, turn the volume on your t.v. down and put in some music in a cd player.  O.k. Angie and Chris smiling.  Yes they smile.  And smile.  And smile.  The first time I did this workout I found myself smiling.  Weird but I don't do it anymore.  Just that one time.  There is a warm up session (about 5 minutes long) and 5 different sets, which are about 10 minutes long, you can choose from.  Also there's an option ""Music Only"" where you can only have the music playing and you don't have to hear what Angie is saying.  Angie is considerate.  She let's you know when the tempo is going to start (faster pace) and how many more you have to go before you're done.  She encourages you.  Not as good as Denise Austin (love her) but she does a decent job.  I use a 10 lb. kettlebell along with this dvd.  I believe Angie is using a 15 lb. bell.  Another thing, Chris (she's in the video with Angie standing behind/beside Angie, shows a different way to do a workout if you're having trouble with what Angie is doing, so that's nice too.",1312329600,,1796,4.296407185628743

The first time I used it, my butt, inner/outer thighs, and my hamstrings were so sore that I couldn't hardly walk for about four days.  But at least I knew I was doing something!  For a beginner, it's pretty intense.  Angie keeps a smile plastered on her face the entire time and does the work out right along with you.  She's good at encouraging you, and lets you know how many more you have to go.  I have never been able to get through the entire workout at one time.

I did the DVD every other day all winter long with an aerobic activity in the days off.  I soon began noticing some well defined muscles in my arms and abs!  After about 3 weeks I bought a 15 lb. kettlebell because the 10 lb. was feeling a little easy on some of the exercises.  I continued with this routine until May when the rowing season started.  I felt so strong this year in my rowing shell.  Because I row almost every day, I have not done the Kettlebell DVD too much this summer.  I will start again next Fall and plan on doing the same routine as last year; kettlebell DVD and aerobic activity ( cross country skiing or ergging on the rowing maching).

I was in awe of her tiny, yet chisled frame and always wondered what else she did to look like that since cycling is a lot of lower body work. Then one day she mentioned working out w/a kettle bell and another day mentioned ""filming again in the fall"". This peaked my curiousity so I went home to ""google"" her and stumbled upon her kettle bell video. I ordered it hoping it wouldn't be a dust collector like all the others I own. If I am at home, I can always find something else to do instead of workout.

Within a week I started to see definition in my arms, back and shoulders for the 1st time ever! My stomach was getting flat and my hamstrings/butt were getting toned. I was amazed! Many friends asked what I was doing and I recommended this video to all of them.  This video has a great combination of exercises to get FULL body results. Angie does a great job explaining, motivating and reminding you of proper form.  I HIGHLY recommend this video but do not recommend pushing through the whole video your 1st time through(I was sore for about 4 days). I would suggest 1/2 one day and 1/2 the next until you get used to it because my whole body was screaming. Going to try her newest workout soon. She is GREAT! This is a looong review and could keep going and I NEVER write reviews, that's how much I love it!",1309219200,14,2103,4.758904109589041
3611291,4,B001GIJRP4,"Overall, I really liked this DVD. There are eight different workouts on it altogether, each set at a different pace and intensity level. Each workout is short, but gets to the point right away. I was definiely sweating and felt really good after each workout. This DVD is good for all different levels of kettlebell users (as it states on the cover of it). The only thing I would say that may be a drawback is that the more advanced kettlebell users may get a bit bored or feel a bit unchallenged fairly soon after starting this DVD. I plan on working may way up to the 10-pound kettlebell while doing these routines over again until I feel that it's time to move towards a more advanced set of exercises. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this DVD to any beginner or intermediate kettlebell user who is looking for some quick and useful routines!",1309132800,,854,4.516129032258065
3611292,5,B001GIJRP4,"This is a great exercise routine.  It's great because it is ingeniously balanced in multiple dimensions.  Angie leads you through strength, flexibility, balance and aerobic exercises.  Upper and lower body, left and right sides are equally exercised.  It's the complete package!

I agree with other posters that, with a 10 lb kettle bell, this is not a beginner's workout.  I think it could be effective for beginners with an empty hand or a lighter kettle bell (or even dumbbell).  The great thing is that you'll never get too fit to gain from this routine.  Just get a heaver bell.

Angie is tough, but also friendly and charismatic.  I really look forward to doing this hard workout.",1308873600,,686,4.836206896551724
3611293,1,B001GIJRP4,"I am SO disappointed! I took a kettle bell class in Canyon Ranch, and loved it! What a great workout! So I bought a kettle bell and started doing the workout that came with it. I wanted more, read all the great reviews on this site, and decided this would be the DVD I would buy. What a disappointment!

First.. I will give her this... the tutorial is excellent.. for what there is of it... except that she only goes over a few exercises. The other ones are a surprise when they come up on the DVD. You struggle to figure out which leg to lift and where to do what.

And, just an aside about exercise tapes in general that drive me crazy.... Why do they have the instructor facing you???  Every single exercise class I go to, they face away from you so you can copy their movements. At least have a split screen or a mirror behind the instructor so I can follow what the instructor is doing! Sorry, my brain doesn't work this way, and I can't flip it over in my mind.

OK.. rant over. Back to this DVD.  I loved the warm up. Warmups are usually boring, but this one was very good. Now things go down hill quickly.

Here we are at the work out sections. I couldn't do most of Part One because it's got this ""curtsy"" thing going on where you have to turn to one side and bend your knee behind you practically to the floor. After having three meniscus knee surgeries and two torn ACLs, I could just see my knee popping out.  No thank you! Then, to make it worse, she does them ""to tempo."" (Fast). I stood there with my kettle bell in hand waiting for something I could do. But I had to wait a long, long time.

So then I go to Part Two. There she goes again with these exercises she didn't teach in the tutorial, and with the dangerous knee movements. And, now, she's got some kind of move where you balance on one leg, with the kettle bell in one hand, and you bend over (trying not to fall) with your leg up in the air behind you and drop the bell on the floor. I could not do this, and I'm a black belt in judo. If you know anything about judo, it's all about balance.

So in a nut shell, I think this DVD is the absolute worst exercise tape I've ever purchased. I am now on the search for a SAFE kettle bell DVD.",1305936000,9,2213,4.068965517241379
3611294,5,B001GIJRP4,"This workout will challenge you.  I have done this workout a couple times and I feel great and empowered after it.  Just one suggestion, make sure that you keep proper form to prevent injuries.  She has a tutorial that you should go through especially if you are new to kettlebell training.  If something does not feel right, stop and adjust.  On another note, Angie Miller personality is pleasure.  Overall, a wonderful workout to add to your routine.",1304294400,,452,4.805194805194805

I started with a 5 pound kettlebell, and couldn't get through the workout the first two times.  I can get through it now, still using only 5 pounds, as that gets my heart rate up (I use a heart rate monitor) and I am still sore the next day.  Now, the first few times I used this, I was quite sore the next day, I have been using this for 3 weeks now, and am only slightly sore the next day.  But...with only 5 pounds and only 3 weeks in, I am noticing changes in my body.  My arms are more defined, and my booty is definitely lifted.  (I do this video 2-3 days a week, spin 2-3 days a week, and belly dance one day a week).  Good workout, and it goes fast.",1303084800,3,742,3.9066666666666667

I can really feel the effectiveness of the moves in the core and other areas.  It is not boring but fun! Although Angie Miller uses a 15lb bell, I started off with a 5lb bell and am now alternating between a 5lb and 10lb bell. I really like Angie's low key personality.  She explains the moves well but the work out goes at a nice pace and has a lot of variety.  I am now looking into buying more of her exercise DVDs.",1301702400,5,585,4.052173913043478
3611299,5,B001GIJRP4,"I am new to Kettlebells and not in the best shape.  In the past month I have been going to the gym about 4 times a week doing everything from the eliptical to Spin classes.  I heard about Kettlebells and wanted to give it a try.  I bought the 8 pound Kettlebell from jfit on Amazon (I had debated on what size to get for a long time).  I bought this DVD because of the reviews and I have to say I was not dissapointed.

The DVD starts out with a tutorial to show you the basic moves that are used - I skipped most of this because it was slow.  The workout itself is at a slower pace so I am not sure it really covers my cardio but I can definately feel the burn in my arms after doing the whole thing.  I liked that it was slower because I am new to the Kettlebell and I want to really focus on form.  Angie uses a 15 pound Kettlebell and says beginners should use a 10 pound bell - at first I thought the 8 pounds was way too easy but as the video progessed I definately felt muscle fatigue with the 8 pounds and think I made a wise choice to start.  If I do this on a regular basis, I could definately see myself working up to a 15 pound bell in no time though.

The DVD is divided up into 7 circuts and gets progessively harder.  I was able to make it through most of the DVD on the first shot - there were a few ab exercises that I could not do and I did the modified versions on the few of the moves to get used to them.  All in all, I think this is a great workout.  I would say this is definately easy enough for beginners and if you use heavier bells it is probably great for those that are more advanced.  Highly recommend.",1301097600,,1632,3.8618618618618616

It took about one week for my body to see results and it was a complete transformation. Every move Angie Miller uses targets almost every muscle so you are getting a full body workout and it helps with your core which is great since crunches are not my favorite thing to do. I swear by this dvd and tell all of my friends and family about it as well. The only negative is that it is intense and beginners may find it a bit demanding, but please don't give up.

I have been using kettle bells for a few years, but was interested to see what people were putting out there as the popularity of kettle bells has rapidly increased.  This video has a nice tutorial in the beginning and is broken up into different sets.  It also includes a warm up and brief cool down.
I use a 12kg (approx 25lb) bell for most of my workouts, and choose heavier bells if the movement requires heavier weight.  (ie. double arm swings) However as a female the 12kg bell was often too much for me in this video.  Some of the moves, I feel, are down right dangerous if using a heavier bell.
If you are looking for a good workout with light weight this should work for you.  However if you have a heavier bell, I would not recommend it.",1297987200,4,844,4.24375

3611307,3,B001GIJRP4,"I've have wanted to explore kettlebell since having back surgery.  I know it is important to develop a strong core to help from repeating any future back problems.

I am a fit 51 year old.  I'm an avid swimmer and I even teach safe exercise to people over 65 years of age.  With that said, safety is always a key requirement for me to any DVD exercise video especially to body's that do ultimately change with age.

There were two DVDs on kettlebell that I have tried recently and would like to give a review on both.

Angie Miller's ""Kettlebell Bootcamp"" was the first that I purchased.  It was a very good workout that made me sore every time that I did them, but for me there were just too many lunges.  After 51 years of stress on the knees, this is an exercise my body is aware to be very cautious of when doing.  I did make my own modifications and took what I know from weight training to make my workout feel like I was doing moves safely.  I did not feel there was much in the way of proper form and safety cautions given in this DVD.  With safety in mind, I would rate this a 3.

The second DVD I purchased was Lauren Brooks' ""The Ultimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning with Kettlebells"".  Lauren is a Certified Instructor of Russian Kettlebell and you feel like you are in a private session (no frills to this video).  She gives wonderful instruction on what is most important to me proper form and safety.  Her DVD is broken up into a 12-minute workout, which can be repeated for a second or third set.  Then there is a 40-minute workout.  I like Lauren's style and instruction.  There are no lunges...just squats.  If you want proper form and safety I would recommend this highly.  On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this tops.",1294531200,128,1736,4.332298136645963

I would not recommend a ten pound bell for a beginner. I've done other k-bell workouts and have used a five pound bell and am now ready to move on to a heavier one. If you've never done k-bell before and are doing this work out, start with a five pound bell.

The one thing I noticed is when Angie does the two handed swings with the bell she snaps her knees forward rather hard and that's not the way I learned it when doing Gin Miller's k-bell work out. I have problems with my knees and doing it the way Angie does it looks like it would make things worse if you have problems with your knees.

I also have to agree with another poster about Angie's assistant Chris. The girl has a vacuous smile on her face through the whole work out. Smiling that much through a work out makes it seem to me (I don't know about anybody else) that she's not working hard enough.",1272672000,6,1063,4.028436018957346

This Kettlebell workout has no timer and no rest periods.  Each section in this workout is about 10 minutes in length, and so it's not really feasible to divide each section into it's own interval.  I believe this is why they suggest a lower-than-normal kettlebell weight.

Unfortunately all I have is my 30lb Kettlebell which made this workout all but impossible to do all the way through without taking  frequent breaks.  My advice is to either use a lower weight as suggested, or put your own rest periods in.

3611323,2,B001GIJRP4,"I don't know Angie Miller's background but I suspect it's in aerobics and not kettlebells.  She doesn't know the terminology of kettlebells.  The kettlebells are treated as weights and she did not take advantage of their unique qualities.

She did an excellent tutorial involving swings, then the first two-three exercise sets had totally different exercises (more with an aerobic feel than kettlebell).  Also, she gave me the impression of making up some of the routines on the fly.  The background music is the typical high beat techno music.  One other item bothered me--If this is a kettlebell workout, why was there a rack of dumbbells in the back of the set.  It gives mixed messages.

She and her supporting instructor Chris had the most artificial smiles painted on their faces, like they were hiding any discomfort or pain.

I understand bootcamp exercise DVDs are supposed to be difficult, but I don't think Angie Miller is a qualified drill sargeant.

3611327,4,B001GIJRP4,"CALORIE BURN: First I should note I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn, which also allows me to read a measurement of  calories burned during a specific workout as well as calories burned per minute during that workout. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. For a cardio and strength mix, this had excellent calorie burning IF you do more than one segment. While cardio will always burn more than a strength workout DURING the workout, strength training continues to boost your metabolism and burn calories long after the workout. So this combination of boosting your heart rate with cardio while also using the kettlebell to reach so many muscles AND using your own body strength to also tone, results in a great burn. However, for optimum results you will want to combine at least a couple of the short segments. One segment alone didn't have high burn. In fact the first session (of approximately 10 minutes) had quite a low burn, but when I combine two in order to get my heart rate up, keep it up, then utilize the strength moves this dvd offers to keep burning calories after the workout, I had great results.

MUSCLES WORKED: This dvd will reach them all. The kettlebell is wonderful for making a workout fun and interesting while reaching muscles you might not otherwise hit in many strength training workouts.  You WILL feel this one very quickly after your workout and you will get results. Your abs are even toned in standing and twisting ab moves. Major fanny lifters and thigh toning right along with toning your arms with the kettlebell. The duo moves to reach more muscle groups are smartly done.

SET: Yawn. Nothing special. Nothing bad either. Indoor studio. The usual.

MUSIC: Upbeat electronica

INSTRUCTION AND CUEING: Excellent...I followed every move easily. There is no complicated choreography. That said, I think I did more curtsies in the first segment than the queen gets in a week. That part was repetitive but boy I felt it in my thighs a few hours later...the rest of the dvd offered greater variety and I prefer that to keep my interest.

LEVEL: From beginner to advanced. There is someone in the background (one instructor and one back up person) doing beginner moves if you are new to working out. However, as you progress upwards, just use a heavier weight in order to keep getting results.

WEIGHT OF KETTLEBELL: There is much discussion on this but I think it's safe to say that if you normally workout with a 5 lb dumbell in each hand, you can obviously work well with a 10 lb kettlebell.  I personally use 6-7 lb dumbells and often combine the two in one hand for certain moves so a 12 lb kettlebell was very comfortable for me. (I have no brand preference but I ordered one with a vinyl coating because when you swing below your legs, or place it on the floor holding it with one hand and balancing on one leg, it's too easy to scratch a wood floor otherwise.)If you are new to strength training you may want lower than either of those...it's realy something you have to find on your own, but that's been the best measurement I've told others that's seemed to work...just get what you can normally lift in two dumbells.

ENERGY: Pretty good...I liked the instructor. Nothing over-the-top. No fake toughness but also no sugar sweet condesceding...in the middle. I liked her.

NEGATIVES: Although there are several segments and you will probably want to combine 2-4 for a proper workout, you only have the choice of choosing one or doing them all. I can live with that but I know some don't like it.

CONCLUSION: Some kettlebell workouts are strength training only which are great for toning, but low on calorie burn. This one provided what I got my kettlebell for...high calorie burn and great toning combined. This is one of my favorite kettlebell workouts.",1261958400,30,3884,4.712389380530974
3611328,5,B001GIJRP4,I really like this kettlebell workout. There is a tutorial section where Angie shows you how to do the moves which is helpful for beginners. I workout regularly by running and strength training and found this to be both a good cardio and strength workout. I was able to complete the workout on the first try. I alternate between a 10 and a 15 lb kettlebell depending on the exercise. I alternate this video with Lauren Brooks' Ultimate Body Sculpt kettlebell DVD to mix things up. Overall this is a great workout.,1260489600,,513,4.586956521739131
3611329,5,B001GIJRP4,This is the best kettlebell workout dvd I've found.  You can go with the chapter selections and rest between if you need to.  I had a 15lb kettlebell but this workout was too difficult for me so I bought a 10lb kettlebell.  Now I can work up to the 15lb bell.  This workout will get your heart pumping.,1259625600,4,302,4.155172413793103
3611330,5,B001GIJRP4,"I am new to the kettlebell and have never done a workout with Angie Miller.
I thought she was a bit soft spoken but I turned the volume up a tad and that made it easier to hear her.
The tut on the use was good. I like the way this is segmented out, you don't have a chance to get bored your already off to the next segment. I did the complete workout and the time just flew by.

You get a complete workout and you are using the kettlebell the whole time.
I definatly feel the effects of the workout today! The buns and inner thighs are burning  - LOL",1252627200,5,550,3.9017857142857144
3611331,5,B001GIJRP4,"Like some other reviewers here, I thought I was in reasonably good shape.  Wrong!  I just received the DVD today and tried to do the whole workout.  Whew.  Background: I am 53, I work out regularly, and I am not overweight.  I am ""skinny-fat"" meaning I look OK, but I can, shall we say, ""pinch an inch"" here and there.  Since it's not going to get any easier, I've decided to get super-fit (zero flab) once and for all.  I read in Shape magazine where a marathoner who was also ""skinny-fat"" worked with a kettlebell trainer and got into great shape, so I decided to give it a try.  I got a different dvd, IronCore, from the library because I didn't want to spend $ on yet another exercise dvd that I can't stand/don't use.  Well, that one is fine for a beginner.  I didn't feel as though I was getting much of a workout with the 10lb bell and I didn't want to injure myself by going to a higher weight too soon.  I came here and saw the reviews and ordered this dvd, and I'm so glad I did!  It is much more thorough, and functional - meaning you move in ways that you really do move in real life, lifting a suitcase into the overhead bin etc. as Angie states in the introduction.  Really true.  I have to say, I could not do the entire dvd the first time out.  And really, I work hard on the rowing machine which is basically a combo weight/resistance training plus cardio, several times a week.  If you are truly a beginner, I would do this dvd with no weights first (yes, you read that right) and then start with a light one, even 5 lbs.  Or start with the IronCore dvd (although I think you'd get bored with it quickly, and her tone of voice sounds like she's addressing a 2 year old which I found quite annoying.)  Angie on the other hand sounds like a real trainer, or a friend - very pleasant, although you have the option of just choosing the music with no prompts.  And I love that Angie and the girl who demos the ""easier"" versions are super-fit - they are the first video presenters I have seen who look as though they got into shape using the exercises on the video.  Their long, lean shape is very motivating.  I should also state that I really do not like to exercise per se.  I'm fine with activities, but when I want to get in shape I have to negotiate to get myself to do exercises, especially later in the day.  Let me just say, I love the kettlebell!!!  I typically don't even wait until 4 p.m., my scheduled time.  I even feel like doing it on my ""day off"".  This is unprecedented.  Seriously.  I have a drawer full of exercise videos that I have to force myself to do (so you know they don't get done often) and I am truly excited now to get in shape with the kettlebell.  I was sweating like you wouldn't believe, and this continued for 15 - 20 minutes after I was finished.  I'm sure I will see results with this.  It is probably the best overall workout I have had, and I have been exercising since I was 24.  I also think it's a great workout for bone strength, which sure beats taking drugs at some point.  Oh, one reviewer states that the sequencing is not good as there are some harder sets up front and easy ones toward the end.  Well, yes, ab work and stretching are typically done at the end of a workout, and yes, they feel easier than swinging a lead ball around the room and over your head.  This is not poor sequencing, it is good exercise protocol.  I otherwise liked that review though, and it is the one that convinced me to get this dvd.  This is a super-efficient way to get weight-training plus cardio plus toning plus abs.  I couldn't recommend it more.  Good luck and fun training!",1251676800,201,3623,4.225947521865889
3611332,5,B001GIJRP4,"I really got a good workout from this DVD. It gets the heart pumping and strengthens the body at the same time. Very good for the core. My only issue was that I have bad knees and the curtsy squat/lunges made them hurt. So, I don't go as deep on those and get a great workout. This is one of my favorites.",1249776000,5,305,3.935483870967742
3611333,4,B001GIJRP4,"I recently bought this video and I feel a *little* let down. Although the quality of the production is good and Angie is excellent at what she does and certainly a professional, I thought some aspects of this video's marketing were misleading. That being said, some aspects of the video are quite good.

The cons:

For one thing, the video is marketed as a good selection for beginners, intermediates, and experts in fitness. This, I feel, is untrue. Angie mentions that beginners should start with a 10lb kettlebell, which I did, although I have been working out for over a year (training for a 10k, doing cardio and some strength training) and I find the video impossible to complete in one session. I can't imagine that a true beginner would find this workout is at all suited to their needs. IF you have a small kettlebell of maybe 5lbs, as a beginner you *might* be able to complete the video in one session.

Also, there is a tutorial of about 5 minutes in length which you can use as a warmup, although it is quite difficult all on its own. It covers some basic kettlebell moves that Angie will use in the duration of the video, specific information about form and technique, and general info about kettlebells. The problem? She ONLY covers about seven individual exercises and the video covers many, many more! I always watch the videos I use first before attempting to do them and I was really surprised that the tutorial did not go through, at least once, all of the maneuvers she will use. I'm totally choreography challenged, so I always choose workouts that are slower and more about proper form than about complicated floorwork. To its credit, the video is not choreography heavy and you can certainly stop the video to repeat any parts you don't get, but to my mind, a good video does a better job at least preparing you to do any steps it expects.

Another issue I have with the video is that I felt like the sections were not organized well. The beginning of the video has several rather brutally difficult portions, then the end has 3 very easy ones. I felt like a better workout would have alternated these a little bit better to give you a brief reprieve and bring your heart rate down some (which is more like intervals and better for fat burning).

The last con I have has nothing to do with the workout itself; rather, it is about Angie's assistant. She smiles and is robotic throughout the WHOLE video which is extremely annoying if you're sensitive to that. She's also about six ft. tall and thin as a rail, which if you're round (like me) is kind of annoying. I think it's refreshing to see someone with a few curves on a video I'm using.

The pros:

You WILL get results with this video. You will. There is no question here. IF you can complete the video (or work yourself up through completing the separate portions of it) you will get nearly immediate results. I have done it in parts four times and I got results after ONE workout. That's it. ONE. I could not believe the muscle definition.

The workout is structured in portioned sections so that you can pick and choose what you can/want to do. I personally mix the harder portions with easier workouts, the easier portions with harder workouts. That's handy. Also, There is an option to just listen to the music of each section and not the cueing, etc, if you don't want to listen to Angie's voice.

The music is a good fit. It's a little overpowering in certain sections but not annoying, I did not think.

Angie is good at cueing for form. Often she reminds you to squeeze your glutes, bicep by the right ear, back straight, push through the heels, etc. Very important for a beginner! It would be WAY too easy to hurt yourself with a heavy kettlebell if you were not cued well and often as to proper form. HOWEVER, that being said, Angie does NOT do a lot of instruction or cueing for proper basic kettlebell two-armed swing form. I actually viewed several different tutorials on youtube just to make sure I had good form and I was definitely not in good form at first. Angie does say something like ""your butt should feel like it's touching a piece of glass behind you"" as you squat to do the swing, but for me that was not enough info. I personally used the instructional video that came with my kettlebell. That instructor said to envision yourself about to sit in a chair and --bingo!--I totally understood it. I wish Angie had been more clear.

Thanks for bearing with a long review! In short, buy this video if: You want results, you aren't a TOTAL beginner, and you want to get your heart rate WAY up there. Don't buy it if you are a total beginner, or you need lots of tutorial and instruction.

Happy kettlebelling!",1247097600,124,4709,4.514084507042254
3611334,5,B001GIJRP4,"This is a great DVD.  Angie Miller is not an instructor I'd heard of before, but her cueing is really good.  (She reminds me a little of Cathe.)  This is not a ""traditional"" kettlebell workout; it incorporates traditional moves like swings and windmills, but there's also some moves I've never seen before.  Really effective at burning calories and building strength.  I use both a 12- and 17-pound kettlebell for the exercises.  Angie uses a 15-pounder throughout. Broken down into sets, this workout can be done as one long workout (if you dare!).  More often I use it as part of a circuit, i.e., alternating one set of the workout with five minutes on the elliptical trainer, for about 45 - 50 minutes. Swinging that kettlebell will really get your heartrate up!  Enjoy!",1245369600,,773,4.803030303030303
3611335,5,B001GIJRP4,"I did Angie's Kettlebell bootcamp once a week for eight weeks.  It was very tough at first and I was sore a lot, but what a difference it has made.  By the third week, I was feeling stronger, less sore, and was able to increase the weight from a 10 lb to a 15 lb kettlebell.  I normally work out 3-4 times a week but dreaded doing any strength training at all.  Kettlebells was different enough so that I wanted to try it and I am not lying when I tell you I lost 6 inches overall after that 8th week. I am more toned and definitely stronger and have gained more confidence in doing any kind of strength training.  This is EFFECTIVE.  I highly recommend it.",1243728000,19,657,4.133858267716535

3611337,4,B001GIJRP4,"I am new to using kettlebells and bought this DVD to help me get into a routine of exercises to do.  I didn't know what to expect from it. The routine styles would be what I would call aerobic style using weights.  in this case the weights are kettlebells.  If you don't like the way aerobic workouts (like the popular Firm series, or others geared toward women) are based, then you won't like this.  I consider it more aerobic style because it more of lunges, side steps, and feminine moves like that opposed to kicking moves and jumping, in more rough and rugged styles.

 Although I have always lifted weights (dumbbells) I found this to be difficult to keep up with, endurance wise.  I only done it 3 times as of now.  I disagree with it being for all levels (beg-adv).  I would consider it to be more intermediate.  Hard to keep up with at first, but I can seem myself getting better each time and soon will be able to keep up without a problem and plateau.",1241568000,4,962,4.353932584269663

3611340,1,B001GIJRP4,"Took a while for  Kettlebell Bootcamp with Angie Miller to arrive (I'm overseas) but it was worth the wait.  Although I use free weights, this was my first session using kettlebells, so to play it safe I started out with a 5lb KB. (Something that I think should have been recommended for new KB users)  I don't normally watch tutorials but did this time, since KBs are new to me.  It was short, but sufficient in addressing the correct KB usage and the primary movements used in the DVD. Following that I moved into the full workout.  The movements were easy to follow and I really appreciated the different camera angles,  which give a good visual reminder of how your body should look during each segment.  The music was decent, as were Angie's instructions.  Neither were distracting nor irritating to listen to, and before I knew it the session was over.  I feel like I got a good overall workout (balance was even worked into some of the moves) and expect even more of a challenge when I move to heavier KBs.  I would have liked a few more plyometric moves and more matt work for the abs using the KBs, but as it stands, I'm sure I'll be using this DVD on a regular basis. (Along with my Jerri Love ""Ripped"" DVDS and Anna & Ravi Kundalini Yoga DVDs)

Couple of suggestions to other people new to kettlebells -- make sure your KBs have longer and wider grips/handles.  The ""handle"" on my 5-lb kettlebell isn't as long/wide as those used on  Angie's DVD, and it made some of the moves (such as passing the KBs from one hand to the other at top of the swing) a bit more difficult to accomplish, though still possible.  Keep this in mind when purchasing your KBs.  Also, to insure better balance when swinging the KB (especially while balancing on one leg),  I'd recommend wearing shoes with good foot and ankle support.

Final recommendation --Amazon should allow reviewers to also edit their star rating.  I first rated this at one star (since they asked for my review and at one month I still hadn't received the DVD) I now give it four stars, but am not allowed to make that change in my updated review.",1240358400,27,2108,4.473821989528796
