8414070,4,B004307C5Y,"A likable if sometimes frustrating portrait of the Canadian musician and composer.  Its likable because the artist known as Socalled (Josh Dolgan off-stage) is a very creative guy, who mixes hip-hop with Jewish klezmer music, 70s style funk, and multiple other influences in a never ending quest to create new sounds, some of which are terrific.  Frustrating because we mostly only get snatches of the music.  Enough to see that its clearly interesting stuff, but not enough to really get a feel for it.

Socalled himself, also comes off as something of an introvert, and while we learn a decent amount about how he approaches his music, he doesnt let us inside enough to really get a sense of the human being or artist under his skin.  Never dull, worth seeing if you're interested in World music, or very creative mash-ups, but its hard not to walk away wanting even more.",1419897600,,874,4.76158940397351
8414071,5,B004307C5Y,"I enjoyed the front man and his story very much. It had wit, music, originality and charm. I saw them live at Marty's in Chicago and they blew me away!",1393977600,,151,4.066666666666666
8414072,5,B004307C5Y,"I searched for Socalled after a concert a few years back in Amherst Mass. Blown away by the performance I found numerous Utubes featuring John Dolgin and Socalled.  I heard repeated mention of a full featured movie and went to Amazon which almost always delivers. Having seen many of his Utubes I was familiar with parts of Josh's story.  The Socalled Movie filled in all the blanks and now I will try to collect  all the albums.  A fascinating story of fusing Old Style Klezmer Music with Contemporary styles like Jazz, Hip Hop and Rap.  I will come back and add to this review as I watch it again and again.  I was already familiar with the Original Klezmer Musical history and artists but you don't have to be Jewish to love this creative artist and what he is doing.",1389830400,,770,4.464285714285714
