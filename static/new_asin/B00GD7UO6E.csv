6071913,4,B00GD7UO6E,"Let me just say I'm tired of buying a new season of my favorite British mysteries only to find that the latest ""series"" only contains a paltry two or three episodes (eg. George Gently, Season Four only contains two episodes-- though each is excellent). Really, that's not my definition of a series and it's a disturbing trend. Above Suspicion, Set 3 offers only three episodes. I feel a bit cheated, thus the 4 stars instead of the 5 I'd probably otherwise award this series.  Anyway, back to the episodes at hand -- Series 3 picks up where the previous one left off -- well, sort of.  There's a gap between the two series that is never properly filled in,  leaving the viewer to wonder what happened in the interim and playing ""catch up"" with the characters and events. Personal tensions, doubts, betrayals, ambitions and passions tightly weave their way through the detective squad while the detectives try to solve the murder of a promising young actress.  The conflicts and betrayals experienced by the detectives are shown in counterpoint among the actors and hangers-on who surround the victim. It's a well-done mystery; very well-acted (especially by Ciaran Hinds). With the exception of the ""gap"" between Season 2 and 3, it's very well scripted --- another intelligent police drama devised by Lynda LaPlante.",1396828800,,1316,4.9411764705882355
6071914,5,B00GD7UO6E,All three of these series segments were enormously enjoyable. The sexual tension between the two main characters was handled deftly as was the moral ambiguity of the situations in which they found themselves. This is grown-up material handled with skill and taste.,1396742400,,264,5.309523809523809

6071918,5,B00GD7UO6E,A really strong entry in this series.  I think they have done an excellent job of translating the books to the screen.,1396224000,,118,4.363636363636363
6071919,5,B00GD7UO6E,I love the 2 main characters; hopefully it will not end prematurely like so many other british productions do unfortunately,1396051200,,123,5.2
6071920,3,B00GD7UO6E,"Disappointing compared to series 1 & 2: complicated police complicity isn't as interesting as well written personalities.
Unrealistic characters and scenarios.",1395360000,2,159,6.619047619047619
6071921,5,B00GD7UO6E,"Writer Lynda La Plante thrillers again. Above Suspicion 3 is fast action suspense, violent crime, a again investigated by a sexy cop. coarse realism of London crime fighting includes blood and f-language; suitable only for adults. 3 episodes are parts of the same 2.3 hour multilayer investigation, ""Silent Scream."" And scream you may.

The ongoing series is lead by Kelly Reilly ( twice in `Sherlock Holmes', `Poldark'), DI Travis, red hair over a pixie face, tight togs, and ambition fire. DCS Langton (Ciaran Hinds- `Road to Perdition') case head but working toward vengeance. Continuing from past Above Suspicion series are: DCI Lewis (Shaun Dingwall); DC Maddox (Michelle Holmes); DS Barolli (Celyn Jones); DC Faulkland (Amanda Lawrence).
Many young stars are guests on ""A.S.: Silent Scream."" The murdered film star Delany by Joanna Vanderham (`The Paradise'--strongly recommended DVD). Her druggie flatmates include Felicity (Bryony Hannah -`Call the Midwife' a must own) and Jeannie (Kate O'Flynn). Saraa Stewart (`Philomena') is the murdered actress's agent, while Geoff Bell (`War Horse') is her driver. There is Danny Webb (`Land Girls'), Ray Fearon. . . well . . . the list goes on.

SDH SUBTITLES for the entire 2 1/3 hr feature as well as 37 min of video bonus.
Episode 1 -A murder of film star Amanda Delany just as DCS Langton is bypassed for promotion. (Fallout from Above Suspicion's last great thriller.) Langton leads the murder team which includes DI Anna Travis, already pushing for her own fast-track promotion. Langton uses this case to spend time finding which old team member grassed and cost him his advancement.
Episode 2 -Travis deduces the murder victim may have planned a revealing autobiography. Travis/Langton relationship is professional but cool, issues past unresolved. Is she his mole? If not, who? This 2nd plot heats up while a 3rd related death is discovered.
Episode 3 -Motive is needed for the original murder. How did the drugs connect? It all leads to a shocking and high action thriller ending. Will this series continue? I'm guessing yes. Lynda la Plante (also known for `Prime Suspect') has at least 2 more novels ready for series adaptation.

I own them all. All worth viewing again, even when you know the ending. Top acting and writing is the reason.",1390608000,16,2299,5.10904255319149

I had already enjoyed series 1 and 2 and was delighted to find series 3. One gets too know and appreciate the characters and there is a certain sense of involvement in watching the team of detectives sort out a complicated murder of a famous actress with and infamous life style. I particularly enjoyed the stories within the story; the eccentric role play of the characters (drug addicts, hippies, down and outs, and the team of hardworking detectives) who all interacted brilliantly and added so much to the story. The series was pure entertainment and quite enjoyable. Typical of English police and detective stories, it was a thrilling who dun it with surprising endings and all of the twists and turns that made everyone a suspect. Well Done",1415664000,,902,4.751592356687898

6071954,5,B00GD7UO6E,"ABOVE SUSPICION Set 3.  The show is a British television series, made by ITV that is based on the work of Lynda La Plante, the creator of the PRIME SUSPECT, British TV series that was such a massive hit on both sides of the Atlantic.  Set 3 is based on the bestselling novel SILENT SCREAM by La Plante, a former cop herself.  The British mystery appears to be set in the current day, in London, as the cop shop on which it focuses is the Metropolitan, better known as the Met.  It has been called a younger,sassier successor to PRIME SUSPECT by The Telegraph.  All three episodes come on a single disk, in a box set, running approximately 140 minutes, plus extras consisting of a 20 minute meet the cast;  interviews with Lynda La Plante and crew (17 minutes) and a photo gallery.  Also, a warning, for mature audiences only, contains violence and coarse language.  And, thank goodness, and let me blow a kiss to RLJ Entertainment and Acorn, who have released the set; subtitles, or else what would those of us on this side of the pond do with that quick London cross-chat?

The brutal murder of a famous troubled young actress brings Detective Inspector Anna Travis (Kelly Reilly, BLACK BOX; SHERLOCK HOLMES) back to the team of her old boss, DCS James Langton (Ciarn Hinds, GAME OF THRONES; TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY).  The two must find a killer, while attempting to deal with their ragged relationship. Police work has become Annas life and shes determined to get ahead. Langtons angry about being passed over for a big promotion, and furiously wonders who, on his team, betrayed him. Meanwhile, there are too many suspects for the murder of the beautiful, promiscuous, drug-addled actress.

Theres no question but that Hinds has developed into a middle-aged actor with the chops and the gravitas to carry the series, and that he and the beautiful Reilly produce smoldering chemistry.  The murdered actresss agent Andrea Lesser is played by Sara Stewart (PHILOMENA).  The police procedural elements of the cop shop seem accurately portrayed; the script and photography are sharp and hard-edged.  The entertainment gives us a  scorching look at the shallow, drug-addled world of a bunch of young actors and filmmakers; the viewer might just sense that, in her career, La Plante has had reason to become as acquainted with this world as that of the police precinct and it disappoints her.

The episodes are:
Part 1
Hot young film star Amanda Delany is murdered; DCS Langton is called in to lead the investigating team. He wants to solve the case quickly to get back on his career track. DI Anna Travis is assigned to the team; she interviews possible suspects including several of Delany's former lovers.

Part 2
Anna learns that Amanda had found a publisher for a tell-all book, so the list of suspects grows even longer. Langton visits Travis at home late one night; it's obvious that there are unresolved matters between them. The team finds and views CCTV footage from the night of the murder; a fight breaks out at Amanda's funeral.

Part 3
It is not clear what the motive for Amanda's murder might have been, so it is not easy to focus on any one suspect.  But the situation clarifies as the team goes about its business.

Scripts are taut and absorbing, full of twists and turns while thrusting to a surprising ending and introducing a number of cleanly-drawn characters.  The two stars have robust, convincing chemistry.  We found the show absorbing, and gobbled up all three episodes in an evening.  Think youll like it too.",1400198400,2,3535,4.777960526315789
6071955,5,B00GD7UO6E,I loved this series and would love to see a fourth season. The characters are well drawn as are the stories. The acting superb. I hated for the series to end.....,1399593600,,162,4.258064516129032
6071956,4,B00GD7UO6E,Great acting and story line interesting. I ordered season one and two after viewing this. Need I say more. Anxious for UK to release soon.,1398556800,,138,4.56
6071957,3,B00GD7UO6E,"On the whole, watchable but heavy handed while trying to make Kelly Reilly break the glass ceiling of male detectives. However her English accent and dyed red hair reflects no Irish background--she's a twentieth century English souper. Her character remains reflect none of the humorous/sad/funny attitude of Irish life. Even a fifth generation Irish-American can see this omission.",1398384000,,382,5.603448275862069
6071958,4,B00GD7UO6E,"this is the third and I have them all, I like the series, but sometimes I wonder who is pulling strings for who and really never know who you can trust. I like both main actors, but didn't think they ever really understood the other. I don't think he realized what a back stabber she was and I don't think she realized that he probably knew who it was. If they don't make another we will not know for sure, but I like to believe he did. I still liked to see the inner action in the office and the characters there.",1398124800,,514,4.049019607843137
6071959,4,B00GD7UO6E,"ABOVE SUSPICION is another excellent police series by the always wonderful Lynda La Plante. For some reason, however, the program was discontinued before it really hit its stride.

Set 3 of this show, as released in North America by Acorn Media, is actually series 4 if one is to go by the U.K. release. Either way, it is truly a shame that it ends here. Especially when two further books have been written in the series without having been adapted for television. There is simply no way to understand the powers that be who decide what program continues and which is cancelled.

Comparing the three part Silent Scream episodes of ABOVE SUSPICION to the previous episodes one may detect a slightly less intensity than the earlier programs. Nonetheless, the chemistry between the cast is there, particularly with Kelly Reilly and Ciaran Hinds. Apparently in the books they get together, while in the TV adaptation they don't quite make it, though perhaps if the show hadnt been cancelled there would have been greater viewer satisfaction in this regard. Well never know.

Despite the frustration of this lost opportunity, set 3 of ABOVE SUSPICION is a good, entertaining and involving 3-part yarn about the murder of a young movie star and is filled with brilliant performances, not only from the regular cast, but from some relative newcomers playing assorted druggies and suspects. Its quite something to see the young actress Bryony Hannah playing a dope addict, when she can also be seen as a somewhat mousey nun on the excellent British program Call the Midwife, a testament to the range of British character actors that, collectively, is unequalled anywhere else.

Ciaran Hinds is a powerful presence on screen and his animal edge is beautifully tempered by the sweetness Kelly Reilly projects (even while being believable as an ambitious young detective). This central relationship is perhaps more interesting than the crime itself, at least in these episodes. Perhaps that, and the fact they don't quite get together, is what caused ITV to pull the plug on the show.

ABOVE SUSPICION deserved better. Fortunately, somehow, one thinks, Lynda La Plante will be back, and better than ever.",1397433600,3,2193,5.03030303030303
6071960,5,B00GD7UO6E,"Just realized it was available on line, but didn't matter. Enjoy the plots, the twists and turns. Good British acting, not our shallow script writing and weak acting skills in the US.",1397433600,,183,4.75
6071961,5,B00GD7UO6E,"Ciaran Hinds is not your classic leading man.  Anna Travis is so brooding and devastating as to draw all men's eyes to her.  The plots in this series are unconventional and well-crafted but the underlying current is the tension between the two leads, which has more unexpected turns than the murders they investigate.

Sit down with the DVD and spend an afternoon or evening with consecutive viewings and see the best that the small screen has to offer.",1396915200,2,453,4.782051282051282
