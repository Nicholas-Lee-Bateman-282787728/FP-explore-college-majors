Not happy at all....",1491350400,,213,4.461538461538462
7787764,5,0005445825,"For any serious UFOlogists out there, this is a must watch video! I saw this, I think it was 1998/99 and it blew me away! Very well done and very well thought out theory that may just change how you think about the subject...",1426809600,,225,4.136363636363637
7787765,5,0005445825,"This is without a doubt the most thought provoking fair balanced and eerie ufo documentary I have ever seen. In some wyas it is scary. It gives a view from all sides so that you can make up your own conclusions. I have owned it for years and never get tired of watching it and often have I loaned it out to those who were interested in the subject or the paranormal. There is no question it opens the eyes to the reality of the presumed alien visitors. Time is short, the hour is late and the eyes of the blind should be opened before its to late!",1393632000,,547,4.074074074074074

7787767,5,0005445825,"I run a bookstore in Roswell NM (AlienResistance.org) which specializes in Biblical perspectives on UFOs, and I have read and viewed countless books and videos on this subject. In fact, they are often mailed to me unsolicited by the publishers. This one wasn't, but was mailed to me by a tourist who had been in the shop. And I'm glad!
I like this video because it firstly provides first-rate documentation of the reality of UFOs - and government knowledge of them. Very educational if you're already a believer, and pretty convincing if you're a UFO skeptic. Consultant Bill Alnor has a PhD in communications and teaches Journalism at Texas A&M, and his research skills shine in this video. It may not NOW be ""the most comprehensive"" video available, as the Amazon ""Description"" states, but it probably was when it was released, and the other bullet-points are not misleading - you really do get what they say.
While suggestive of the ""demonic"" hypothesis nearing the end, the video does not overdo it, say if you never believed in demons to start with. The end clip from IDE Thomas on the Genesis 6 angels is more the upshot, rather than just saying ""Oh it's all just a bunch of demons"" like most Christian authors and speakers. Put simply, the conclusions are based on research and documentation, rather than dogma.
You'll watch this several times, and probably pass it on to friends. Just be sure to get something from them for collateral (sp?) or you won't get it back.",1085875200,15,1474,4.76171875
