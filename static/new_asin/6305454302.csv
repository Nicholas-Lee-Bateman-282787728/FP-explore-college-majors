1030553,4,6305454302,The Rock layin the smackdown.  It shows his greatest matches like the ladder match from SS.  It also starts from the time he was in the Nation. All the way to Backlash the difference between the  Rock and Austin's  video.  Was Austin's video showed more footage of his matches.  Rock's  didn't but it was a great video.  Very great athlete he is the most  electrifying man in Sports entertainment if ya smellllalalalala what the  Rock is cooking Jabroni's.  Awesome highlights and feuds especially with  Mankind.  You can tell he really hates Austin!,930268800,,550,4.8478260869565215
1030613,3,6305454302,"This was without a doubt, my favorite Rock video when it was on vhs...however the dvd fails to live up to what I had imagined. As is the problem for the older WWF videos now being released on dvd (Rock Bottom 1998 for example), this dvd lacks a menu for access to chapters or various extra features. I wouldn't so much have minded the lack of extras, there couldn't really have been any. But I want to be able to skip to the next scene without having to fast forward a half an hour. I do like ""Know Your Role,"" but the makers of this dvd should have known their roles and made some chapters.",1014076800,,591,4.147826086956521
1030614,5,6305454302,"Of course I'm a Rock fan so i bought the tape. The movie was excellent. It showed some good matches and it showed when The Rock started. It showed him in the Nation, a Corporate Champ, and of course The People's Champ. It  shows all his famous lines and promos. So know your role and buy ""KNOW  YOUR ROLE"" you Roody Poos. IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK, hey this isn't  sing along with The Rock! The Rock says it by hiself! IF YOU SMELL WHAT THE  ROCK IS COOKIN'!",951955200,7,459,4.066666666666666
1030615,5,6305454302,I thought the video was great.  It showed highlights from some of his best matches and a behind the scenes look at the Gettin' Chefy With It' commerical.  Every Rock fan should get this video!,946166400,4,192,4.457142857142857
1030616,4,6305454302,"A knock-out video. Although there were to little wrestling, but very good when he speaks about  the persona he's playing.",943056000,3,121,5.05
1030617,5,6305454302,"Anything about The Great One is great in my book. The video has all of the history surrounding the rise in popularity of The Rock.  I liked him from day one as The Rock but it took a lot of jabronies much longer to smell  what The Rock was cookin'.  Now, I dare say that there are 6 billion people  in the world, and most likely, 3 billion are now Rock fans.  Eventually,  the entire world will be fans of The Rock.",942192000,,415,4.0
1030618,5,6305454302,"This video is totally hilarious.  It follows the Rock while he is filming his television commercial, ""Gettin' Chefy Wit It"" that lets everyone smell what the Rock is cookin'.  You will also see highlights of  the Rock with the Nation, and his feuds with HHH, Mankind, and the biggest  piece of Texas trailer park trash walkin' God's green earth in Stone Cold  Steve Austin.  The best part of the video is when highlights are shown of  the Rock cutting the most entertaining promos in WWF history.  Know your  role, buy the Rock's video NOW!",937958400,5,540,4.659574468085107

7889469,5,6305454302,"I'm partial to the original character that Dwayne portrayed, eyebrow, ridiculous shirts, and all, as opposed to the character the rock morphed into by the early 2000s. This video captures the early rock character perfectly.",1457568000,,223,5.4

7889475,5,6305454302,"The latest WWF game is the best in the lot, but unfortunately the last for the original Playstation. ""WWF Smackdown! 2"" is pretty much the same as the original, but with more added features.
There are more wrestlers than the last game. New superstars include Lita, Tazz, Kurt Angle (our Olympic hero), Chris Benoit, Rikishi (and his trademark move), Essa Ris, Scotty Too Hotty, Grandmaster Sexay, and Eddie Guerrero and many more. Regular superstars are back as well, including The Rock, `Stone Cold' Steve Austin (he needs to be unlocked before playing as him), The Undertaker, Kane, Chris Jericho, Triple H, and Chyna. Some of the superstars that didn't make in the last game are in this one as well. Mick Foley is also in this game with his new look and so are his alter-egos, Mankind and Cactus Jack.
There are many hidden features that need to be unlocked. As you progress through `Season' mode, features such as superstars, special matches, moves, and other items can be unlocked.
The `Create A Superstar' mode is better than ever. You can create up to ten superstars and make them as detailed as you like and give them unlimited amount of moves as well. `Create A Stable' allow you to form a group and assign at least four superstars to it. `Create A Taunt' allow you to create your own gestures.
More matches are included as well, most of them unlockable. They include TLC (Tables, Ladders, and Chairs. Oh, my!), Slobberknocker (How many wrestlers can you beat in ten minutes?), Special Referee (there can be two refs as well) and more.
Only complaint: There's still no commentary. Rumor has it that it will be resolved in the next game, but it's for the Playstation 2. My evaluation: 10 out of 10.",1034035200,2,1706,4.709030100334449
7889476,4,6305454302,This dvd is good. Learn about the Rock and his character. Lots of interesting matches. Good stuff all around.,1021766400,,109,4.7894736842105265
