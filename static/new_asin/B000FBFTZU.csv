8119941,3,B000FBFTZU,"An old B rated that used to scare the daylights out of us as kids.  It is minimal in fright against today's horror, but still has entertainment value if you want to see horror of days gone by.",1394150400,,192,4.052631578947368
8119942,5,B000FBFTZU,"DVD arrived promptly, in good condition.  These are two older movies that were perhaps scary in their day, but now are just fun to watch, especially with friends.  Instead of screams, viewers will get lots of laughs.",1348358400,,216,4.8108108108108105
8119943,1,B000FBFTZU,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF CATCOM HOME STUDIOS DBL. FEATURE ""THE CRAWLING EYE/ KILLER SHREWS"" RELEASE HERE. 20+DOLLARS FOR THIS STUDIOS MOVIES, IS WAY OVER-PRICED FOR SUCK LACK-LUSTER QUALITY. Do not even bother, their only quality as a Studio, is that they release hard to find film, but its not made the way it should be.

 This is really cheap studio, they do not remaster any of the films. You would be better off getting the Euro version, that was made for the USA, at about 5-7 with shipping. Plus your getting a stellar print. Image does great work on the films they release. So get some soda, popcorn and a proper copy of this great gem from the 50's and enjoy!
 Dont get me wrong, this is from personal experience. Go with Image, once again and enjoy!

PS: in my opinion do not buy this version this item and",1318291200,3,810,4.38
