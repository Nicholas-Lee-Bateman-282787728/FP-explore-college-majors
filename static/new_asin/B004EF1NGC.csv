8426844,1,B004EF1NGC,"Randy Van Patten is a talented guy.  No question about it.  He plays with technique and feel and seems to get even better with age.  I liked his first (2007) DVD, and decided to give this one a try.  An instructional DVD needs to meet several ""requirements"".  First it must meet production standards for video, audio, editing, etc.  This DVD, like his first, is pretty well produced (in some cases almost ""over-produced"" or over-processed -- 8"" rack tom sounds almost the same as a 16"" etc).  Next there must be content worthy of the viewers time (and money!).  Though Randy's first DVD met the bill, this one does not.  Imagine every tired, over-used cliche you've EVER heard about drumming.  Repeat each 10 times with no additional explanation, and you have a sense for what this DVD is, .....entirely.
""Play to a metronome"".  ""Learn to play to a ""click"""".  ""Play ""in the pocket"".  ""Lay down the groove.""  ""The drummer is the foundation of the band.""  ""I can't really explain what ""in the pocket"" means.  It's more of a feeling"".  Yada, yada, yada.  Ok, we get that (got that long ago).  Finally, the ""talent"" in a DVD needs to have some personality that connects with the viewer.  Randy has this.  He's quirky at times to be sure, but he has it.  This DVD includes LOTS of cameo appearances from all sorts of folks you've never seen before (local talent types, the dime-a-dozen types) that simply repeat all the cliches using their (no doubt vast) experience to emphasize the points.  Yeh, we got that already.....lay down the groove.  OK.  All these cameos simply dilute the exposure to RVP's playing and ideas with no alternative payoff.  It such a problem that you begin to wonder why RvP put his name on this.  Several times during the DVD, I got the distinct sense that he too understood this was not a good product, or at least not up to his first DVD.  But, these are his friends and former teacher, who wanted to share in the spotlight this time.  That's the sense you get....that he was talked into sharing the limelight this time.  Look, I'm sure these are all nice folks, maybe even talented in their own way, but if you want people to spend money on a product, you've got to give them something of value.  In my opinion, this simply does not measure up, not even for beginners.  Do take a look at his first (2007) DVD.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.",1295049600,3,2378,4.546099290780142
