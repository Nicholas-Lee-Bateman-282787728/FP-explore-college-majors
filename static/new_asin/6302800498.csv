512550,5,6302800498,"In my opinion, this is the most beautiful movie ever made. The mixture of humor and drama truly make it relative to real life.  To watch Larry, a man on a journey to discover, not only himself, but also the meaning of Life,  is what makes this movie special.  What is remarkable is that the tragedy  that Larry must face at the end is what actually leads to his final  understanding of what the gift of life really is.  I highly recommend  this movie to anyone who appreciates the beauty that can be found in life,  even during dark times.",944006400,28,539,4.32
512551,5,6302800498,A Majestic soundtrack and stunning cimematogrophy give Bill Murray all he needs to turn in one of the greatest performances of his career. The Razor's Edge is the story of one man's life and his search for the true  meaning of being alive. Sacrifice and shameless integrity are among the  lessons that Larry Darrell learns along the road as he follows the common  man's path to to self actualization. If there were more stars available I  would gladly award them to this little known film.,927763200,,489,4.7176470588235295

It is easily one of my favorite Bill Murray performances and the first one of him I ever saw in a serious role. Now that I've watched the movie three times, I've recommendied this movie to several people over the years and, having watched it again, am doing so now. Well worth watching.",1517616000,,391,4.226666666666667
512565,3,6302800498,"If I could give this 1984 color film (pre-HD) 3  stars, I would, but there are no  star increments on this Amazon rating system.

Like many movie remakes, this film created my FIRST SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE from what I earlier saw in the original, regarding how and what the remake gives to the public. For me personally, this means that as I was watching this film, I was consciously comparing it to the original, which starred Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, and Clifton Webb. That film was shot in black and white.

That original 1946 film with the Tyrone Power triad of actors in the lead was stunning and gut wrenching in its storyline and the dialog interactions amongst these 3 characters (and stars!). This is one of the classic films about life, what it is, and what is important.

Cut to this 1984 film starring Bill Murray, Catherine Hicks, and Denholm Elliott as the main triad of actors. Even though this film was in color, it did not have the gravitas that Tyrone Power created when he had acted in the original film. This later film set the stage for Murrays character, Larry Darrell, to be happy-go-lucky instead of serious. Bill Murray as a person is like this. In contrast, Tyrone Powers personal and film character was serious. Hicks Isabel was calm, while Tierneys was gratingly snobbish, selfish, and materialistic - a great opposite to play off of Powers seriousness and grit to learn about what life truly should be.

The start of the 1984 film begins with the lead character, Larry Darrell, as a US pilot who had been shot. He survived while his friends didn't and was compelled to learn why he had lived, and they had perished. The original did not go into this detail, so it lacked the initial driving force to lead Darrell to find out who and what Darrell really was as a person. I liked this beginning better than the 1946 film because it clarified the rest of the story.

This 1984 film told the story well-enough. For the common viewer, the Paris scene of the train of long, endless stairs climbing ever higher to the aerie/ love nest seemed to be at the highest point (heaven) that mankind could experience. The scenes dealing with the height of the stairs, the cleaning up of the aerie together, all were well-scripted and artfully filmed. This was the second great part of this film that wasn't written/ shot this way in the original. I liked it.

This film then continued along until Darrell travelled internationally again after the war. When he ascended the mountain, he started to get extremely cold. At this point, he started reading the holy books that he carried with him to gain insight and knowledge as to how to deal with the cold and also be able to climb to the summit. He had no strength to continue upwards; while he was passed out, he wondered if he would live or die. When he awakened, he kept climbing upward, and he realized that he had to burn the pages of his books to keep warm and survive  not read his books to gain wisdom and knowledge. He stopped from time to time to burn more pages to keep warm, to be able to climb higher until he reached the top. At that point, the sun started to rise, and in so doing, it created a brilliant flash of light, illuminating the world below him but also illuminating his inner self. In other words, the combination of reading his books, understanding and gaining knowledge from them and then burning them (into his soul) to keep him warm (to see the light), become his raison detre.

After this blinding by spiritual light, this process changed the perspective of what Darrells life had to be for him. This means that he had to let some people, activities, and things go, so that he could best carry out the mission for which he had been searching: he learned that the path to enlightenment is as sharp as the razors edge.

I loved this scene and thought that it was better than that in the original film to show that Darrell had finally become illuminated.

However, I had experienced many more emotions watching the original film because there was more tension in the dialog and in the character personalities, some of which were contrary to each other. After I had seen this original, I needed time to digest it.

This led me to my SECOND SOURCE OF INTERFERENCE watching this 1984 film: I was compelled to read the 1944 W. Somerset Maugham book of the same name, after I had seen the 1946 film. The book was even more gut-wrenching, with many more details to make both films clearer.

As a result, I had these 2 interference canvases (the 1944 book and the 1946 film) that were indelibly etched in my mind as I was watching this 1984 film, and some it interfered with watching this 1984 film.

Timing is everything. If I could experience all of these artistic forms again, I would start by watching this 1984 film first, and then working my way backward to watching the 1946 film and then finally to reading the 1944 book. (Please read my Amazon review: https://www.amazon.com/Razors-Edge-W-Somerset-Maugham/dp/1400034205/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516475673&sr=8-1&keywords=the+razor%27s+edge+w.+somerset+maugham&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Razor-s-Edge/dp/1400034205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Razor's Edge</a>

Today, with our current HD format and so many vivid and creative ways of filming scenes, I would like to see a re-make of this film, by producing it in multiple sections to create separate films in a series (like the Hobbit/ Lord of the Rings books and films), so that more of the books original details could be included.

I gave the 3 star rating for this 1984 film because of some mediocre acting and a lack of tension throughout many parts of the film even though there were several superlative scenes.",1516060800,5,5762,4.821681864235056

512569,5,6302800498,"Although this film did not do well in the theater when it was initially released, it is a very good film. I think it maybe because of

512570,1,6302800498,"This was a preposterous project. First of all casting Bill Murray as a 1920s American was way off the mark. Bill is a funny guy but his demeanor is strictly 1990s New York and his mannerisms and way of talking made him seem like a brother from another planet. His co-actors weren't much better. Only Denholm Elliot give a reasonable interpretation of a 1920s character type. Then there is the story, which is based upon Somerset Maugham's classic.  They mangled the original right from the beginning by having Larry (Murray) be an ambulance driver rather than a pilot.(Maybe they wanted to save budget by avoiding flying scenes.) They turned the Polish coal miner into a British dandy, they left out what really happened to Sophie after she left Paris and they made up a whole bunch of other stuff.  They should never have been allowed to call this The Razor's Edge. It should have been called ""Bill Murray Makes a Serious Movie - Watch Him Be Serious""",1506988800,3,952,4.6946107784431135

512583,4,6302800498,"Larry Darrell has the ideal life he grew up with the cultured class and has a beautiful girl that was once skinny now filled out. Her father as a perfect job waiting for him and all is right with the world. That is until the war and now Larry must find meaning in life and why one person lives and another doesn't. He may never find the answer but he must try. In the mean time life goes on around him. How will his search help or harm those around him?

""The Razors Edge"" is a story by W. Somerset Maugham. Naturally to get the fullness of the story you will have to read the book. A closer to the book movie version (1946) was made with Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney (see my review). This version although closer to the book, however has Tyrone Power usurping some of the deeds the Summerset did in the book.

This movie version went one step further to place Bill Murray in the center stage and cut out a lot of the mystery along with Maugham. At first you will say this is not like the book (and it is not); but the modification emphasized the meaning of the book and by changing Larry from a flyer to an ambulance driver emphasized the question of why him and not me? So you can get a feel for the question Larry asks and not just be an observer. Larry's evolvement with Sophie MacDonald once again takes you out of the realm of an observer. Possibly to save time and enforce the ""you are there"" feel, W. Somerset Maugham was completely removed from the story. I really like Anne Baxter (1946) but I have to say that Theresa Russell (1984) made an excellent Sophie MacDonald.

Bottom line if you have nothing to compare the movie with it is watchable and insightful. However it is missing the Razor's Edge.",1501459200,,1711,4.291021671826625
512584,2,6302800498,"Today, Bill Murray is a good actor. When he made Razor's Edge  -back in the 1980's - he wasn't.  Guess it took him a while to transition from SNL Comedian to Good Film actor.

Anyway, he's terrible, either putting on a poker face to look 'thoughtful' or engaging in ironic ""Bill Murray"" quips that don't fit his character.  The supporting characters aren't bad, but they're far inferior to Gene Tierney, Clifton Webb, and Anne Baxter, who starred in the 1946 version. That version is 2 1/2 hours but actually seems shorter than the Bill Murray version, because it better directed, better acted, and has a better script. However, this film is in color, and has more realistic scenes and photography.",1501200000,,698,4.791666666666667

We very much like Bill Murray in his realm of comedy movies, including ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" and so on.  But to put him in a serious movie that requires some dramatic flair and emotional appeal just didn't work.  Bill simply pales in comparison to Tyrone Power who brought dashing good looks and an emotional spirit to the part of Larry Darrell that Bill Murray couldn't begin to match.  Beyond Bill, we couldn't say much good about the casting of other actors.  Catherine Hicks is much too nice a gal to play Isabel.  In contrast, Gene Tierney could show an edge to Isabel that brings to mind other films, like ""Laura"" and ""Leave Her to Heaven.""  That quality made Gene's character's viper-like ways in the Tyrone Power version so much more believable. In their prime, Tyrone and Gene were vastly under-rated dramatic actors and were probably down-graded by jealous Hollywood because of their talent and stunning looks.  Back to the 1984 version, Theresa Russell did her best as Sophie, but Ann Baxter's performance in 1946 was one for the ages.  Ann poured her soul into the tragic role of Sophie and anyone else should have avoided the inevitable comparison. Clifton Webb was the perfect choice for prissy Uncle Elliot Templeton, while Denholm Elliot was just a poor imitation.  Finally, the narration offered by Herbert Marshall in the 1946 production lent a degree of class and faithfulness to Somerset Maugham's novel which was not even attempted in the 1984 version.  How could the 1984 producers think they could get away with something like this?  Some movies just shouldn't be re-made.  ""The Razor's Edge"" is definitely one of them.  Shame on Hollywood for even trying.",1461024000,3,2124,4.855555555555555

512702,5,6302800498,"I like the featured reviews which tell the story outline and how it is appreciated on so many levels by different people for different reasons.  That epitomizes the essence of the story, which deals with what it means to be human.  To be a unique and individual creation seems to be a large part of that, and therefore everyone comes away with a more or less singular experience from the same series of events (as a member of the audience watching this movie, or in life).  The deepest thoughts I have about the movie or the book, which W. Somerset Maugham tells us in chapter one is based on actual people he knew, I cannot express because I have no words for them.  The closest I can get is that I think Larry dealt with suffering not by avoiding or mitigating it, but by embracing the tragedy of life in love and thereby transforming the suffering into something else.  I know that's not an original line, but I give it to you again.  Larry's power of transformation went along with him and affected others, as well. Perhaps that was the focus of his being:  empathy and service, like a spiritual nurse.  Perhaps the goodness has spread and had broad and lasting effect;  Maugham  assures us it did.  I would recommend this as a movie for everyone, whether you want to play with the Why's? or just be entertained for a short time.  Production values are first rate in my book, too, as is casting, direction, etc.  Great watch for all.",1459209600,5,1437,4.480769230769231

512708,5,6302800498,"This film was largely overlooked due to the timing of its release and various biz reasons, which was hard for everybody involved in it to cope with at the time, I'm sure.  Regardless of its negligible box office,  it's a REALLY GREAT FILM, and one of the superb Bill Murray's very few dramatic roles.  Based on a W. Somerset Maughn novel, it covers the story of the heart of the young gentleman protagonist (a non-peasant white male, oblivious to the sufferings of the real world, as is his social circle), as undergoes the maturation process of suviving a stint in WWI and witnessing the brutality of militarism, as well as the less obvious pain of ill-matched love and unrequited love, and, throughout, the healing that comes to everyone who seeks to stay true to their highest self/spirit.

Superb script, cast, cinematography, costumes.  With many twists and turns and locations in historical white America, interracial Paris, and old Tibet - after the film ends you feel like you've completed a meaningful story and are the better for it.  I first saw the film as a rental around ten years ago and loved it, and recently decided to hunt it down to enjoy with partner and add to our cinema collection.

And, an additional praise:  refreshingly in these post-postmodern times, the character of the prostituted woman is multi-dimensionally portrayed with compassion for her trauma-based and addiction-based plight, with none of the misogynist crap that is so rife in media these days.  In fact the French detectives refer to pimps & johns as VERMIN - which is how they should be referred to, and criminalized.",1456876800,10,1611,4.893382352941177

Bill Murray plays a completely believable character who, without fully grasping the magnitude of his volunteer service, is thrust into a world where his willingness to play the fool provides little or no defense from the stark reality he must navigate. His personality undergoes a one way alteration that creates a number of unexpected outcomes. If this isn't life in a nutshell, then I've missed something.

We get a rendition of happenings, and the sad happenings, none of the joy or peace of mind, which is the very value of what he wrote about. How in the face of low or high experiences he was centered. Here he was just wounded, no peace, endless searching. It is not a bad tale to tell, but not what I felt was the purpose of the book.
This rendition left off the actual writer all together, which means there was no one to play off of and share his introspections and joy with... this is just sad. The book is full of the wonder of the experience of life and this had none of that.",1445644800,3,920,4.174157303370786

Today, we have people using modern dialect and humor in movies based on the Dark Ages.

They were dressed in period costumes, but came across as modern 20th century, with no sense of the mores of the time the action takes place.

This is an epic movie about self exploration and romance, about the superficial and the deep. About the wise and the entitled. The main character undertakes a journey through war and exploration, both geographically and spiritually. He finds troubled, but deep love, and loss and pain, and forgiveness.

And, unfortunately, his sappy face also.  For anyone to even attempt to redo this movie seems to me to mean that he has simply ""gone over the edge"" in egomania . Murray simply has no idea of his own limitations apparently.  And, why change the dialogue.  Some of the most powerful scenes from the book and the original movie are rewritten for some unknown reason.  The absolute worst was at the end when they pull Sophie's body from the river, he tells the police he is her fiance and gives her a long kiss on the mouth.

If you don't think Bill Murray has range as an actor, you wouldn't know it from these reviews. He can't pull off drama some say; others think he was too serious; and then there are those who feel he was too comedic. I saw this movie in the theater right after I had my own sojourn overseas to discover what else was out there and to challenge myself to explore an adventure that wasn't safe or predictable. I related to a lot of this movie, from saying goodbye to a beautiful woman that I had begun dating just after I had made irreversible plans to head overseas on a nonrefundable Freddy Laker Airways ticket; to intentionally putting myself into any situation that would put me in a totally different work environment by working on an offshore oil rig in the North Sea. It also allowed me to come to terms not only with myself but with others much the same as Murray's character when he works in the fish stalls. I have seen the original and read the book and don't really care if it resembles them at all. Who cares and what does that have to do with the merit of the movie? There seem to be people who didn't like the movie because they wanted Murray to be funny throughout-while others thought he should have played the whole thing straight. I suspect the common denominator is that most of these people never left everything behind to head into the unknown or know what it feels like to be torn between wanderlust and that comfortable feeling of wanting to be with someone that you feel might be the most perfect person in your life. In short, if you aren't capable of personally plugging yourself into the spirit of this movie, there is a good chance that you didn't like it.",1393286400,9,1779,4.443425076452599

I don't know if it was Bill Murray's performance or the screenplay adaption, or the editing, or what. But I couldn't get involved in this movie at all.

513049,2,6302800498,"This is one of my all-time favorite novels, having first encountered it about a year or so before this film was released. I avoided this movie version (when it was in theaters) because it was mostly panned by critics and the only clip I recall seeing at the time was the ridiculous scene in which Bill Murray acts like a seal when hopping out of a swimming pool (which is downright embarrassing to watch). However, I recently decided to give this a go since it was available to stream and, while I applaud the idea, it's just not close, in spirit or delivery, to the novel upon which it's based. First, Bill Murray's performance is terrible (unless you think someone who's questioning the meaning of existence should be on the verge of breaking in to a sketch comedy at all times). Secondly, the film's director, John Byrum (who's done some odd, but interesting film work), seems overwhelmed by the material. Third, the supporting cast isn't terribly strong (even the great Denholm Elliott is wasted here). Lastly, Murray and Byrum created the screenplay and sadly reworked several key scenes that, in essence, defeat the meaning of Maugham's original text. So, the long and short of it is that we're left with a film that has many good intentions, but is really a confused mess. I've noticed that several reviewers here on Amazon (even those who profess to love the film) don't fully understand the message/intent behind it and I believe that's likely because of the confusion created by a screenplay that's the product of writers who themselves may very well have not fully understood Maugham's text. In addition, I've read many reviews here on Amazon that state Roger Ebert gave the film a good rating. This simply isn't true (Google ""Ebert and Razor's Edge"" to read his original review online).

I do applaud the idea of bringing this wonderful work to the screen. Moreover, the cinematography & costumes are quite good and the soundtrack (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Razor-s-Edge-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000058A2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Razor's Edge Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>) to the film is very engaging, which isn't surprising since it's the work of longtime film composer Jack Nitzsche. So, all-in-all, two stars. And by the way, if you want to see a Somerset Maugham adaptation from the same era that got it right, check out ""Overnight Sensation,"" a short film starring Robert Loggia and Louise Fletcher, which is available via iTunes.",1362268800,2,2536,5.261728395061728

513052,3,6302800498,"I enjoy the work of Bill Murray very much and The Razor's Edge is my favorite book of all time, so I came into this movie with very high hopes, albeit some reservations that Bill Murray would be able to put aside that which makes him so endearing and play a role that calls for gravitas unlike he's ever shown capable. Nonetheless, I owe the discovery of this book (and author) to Murray, because I'd read of his desire to make the movie back in the early 80s and it created enough curiosity in me to read the book prior to the movie's arrival.

Bill did well in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation because those roles allowed enough flexibility for the irreverence and class clownishness that is his stock in trade. As Larry Darrell, a man seeking meaning in life, Murray sadly falls short of the mark. Instead of playing a damaged man seeking purpose and enlightenment, he comes across as a guy who chooses simplicity over wealth; granted a part of the process, but not the end all. Thus, Murray's Darrell seems superficial in his spirituality.

In fact, the only character who seems well cast is Denholm Elliott as the snobbish socialite Elliott Templeton, who narrates the novel and gives critical perspective. Unfortunately, he's wasted and relegated to only half of his character's capacity in this movie, and played more for laughs than anything else. Theresa Russell nails the bitter and tragic Sophie, but unfortunately never allows us to see Sophie's initial mild-mannered naivet&eacute;.

Ironically enough, the information I've read from other reviewers is that Murray went into a bit of a funk after this movie bombed. His suffering may have brought him a clarity and wisdom he hadn't yet attained with his superstar fame in the early 80s. That a better version of this movie may have been possible only after Murray failed in his initial attempt is profundity fitting Larry's search.

If this movie leads you to Maugham and this powerful book, then that merits at least a viewing, so I can't say that I don't recommend it. I will only admit to disappointment that The Razor's Edge failed to deliver the power I experienced in reading this most beloved novel.",1360195200,2,2175,4.792

513056,3,6302800498,"I saw this movie years ago, and I'm a big fan of Somerset Maughn, Bill Murray - not so much.  I do applaud his desire to give this story shape by making it into a movie.  For me the story was not so much about spirituality - although the film tries to drive that point through repeatedly.  But rather it was the dysfunctional jealousy and overwhelming need to possess another human being, that struck home with me.  Bill Murray's character, after a long absence from home, returns to find all his friends lives have moved on, so to speak.  Theresa Russell's character, was married and had children - which she tragically lost in an accident.  The accident killed her entire family, and she is left alone.  She turns to opium... so Bill Murray's character trys to get her off the drug.  In the process they fall in love, paint a house, decide to marry.  It's a beautiful thing.  She finds a reason to live again... They have another friend who is married and is secretly jealous, she wants Bill Murray all to herself.  She does not care that she is affluent, respected, and in a higher station in life... she claims she wants to protect Bill Murray's character from marrying beneath him, or at least what she thinks is beneath him...  However, Bill Murray and Theresa Russell have never been happier...  she knows Theresa Russell has an addiction problem... so she sabatoges everything.  She claims she wants to ""help.""  But what she does is keep leaving Theresa Russel surrounded by bottles of alcohol, knowing this is a problem for her.  While she does this... she says things to make Theresa Russel very insecure... she says Bill Murray doesn't really love her, that he feels sorry for her, that it's just a token attachment... She makes up a lot of things so that Theresa Russell will feel bad because she really loves Bill Murray and doesn't want to make his life a living hell, the way this ""friend"" is suggesting will happen....  Well, the minute she turns her back and walks away... this friend from hell - Theresa Russel drinks and goes right back to opium.  She is found dead in the river with her throat slashed.  Bill Murray goes to this ""friend"" from hell... this woman who is married and apparently just wants to string Bill Murray in her web of deceit... and Bill Murray looks at her and tells her - you killed her as surely as if you had taken the knife to her throat yourself.  Bill Murray and Theresa Russel had a chance at happiness after both having suffered unbelievable emotional hardship with their families... and this woman couldn't stand to see anyone happy - she had to destroy it.  So she orchestrated the whole murder. She played on every weakness Theresa Russell had....
If you enjoy emotional and psychological profiling - there's a lot here.... I thought the book was better and more articulate because that is Somerset Maughn's forte... I've read just about everything he's written... you need the narrators vision in order to do it justice...  For example he talks about how this ""friend"" is thin... not because she's fit or is naturally beautifully thin - but he calls it a self-imposed mortification of the flesh... words matter - and those words are not in the film...  If you say someone is skinny, or show a skinny woman on screen - it's a very different thing than if you describe her as suffering from a peculiear self-imposed mortification of the flesh....",1352332800,,3397,4.653266331658291
513057,1,6302800498,"In ""Lost in Translation"" Bill Murray showed his abiity as a serious actor.

""The Razor's Edge"" was too early in his career for him to attempt it. I found it impossible to believe his character. He seemed to be playing at trying to be real, and the result was shallow and unconvincing.

I was already familiar with the book, which I liked immensely, and the film with Tyrone Power was so perfectly cast that those actors were the people they portrayed.

I never did see this 1984 version.  Then on TV I saw the 1946 version and decided to get a copy of the Billy Murray edition.  I found the more recent film better than the 1946 original.  Especially since it was shot on location.

It seems this movie is having some sort of renaissance.  I see people giving this movie 5 stars, like myself, and saying its the best movie they ever saw and it changed their life.  While I won't go that far, I will say it is probably one of the most underrated movie you might ever see, since it was a box office bomb.  But it has been said in many reviews that a movie about enlightment and looking for the meaning of life, coming out in the 1980's decade of greed did not have an audience.  I agree with that.  Plus this movie just goes over a lot of people's head.  (Sort of like another movie which is also about your finding your soul and is more serious than it seems and that is the film, Joe vs the Volcano.)

If I saw this movie when I was 24 when my father told me to, I probably would not have appreciated it as much.  I think to appreciate to this film you have to some life experiences ""under your belt"".  I think this movie would attract anyone who has lost a close love one and/or someone who ""saved"" your life mentally, physically or spiritually.

I give it 5 stars.  Some parts especially early in the film, Murray goes act aloof and somewhat funny, but if you read the book that is how Larry Darell is. And Bill Murray in this movie walks around at times with a stare as if staring into space and not reacting  to incidents......but again read the book; perhaps its part of being shell shocked from the war.

A movie very worthy of seeing.  And look at the 1946 version, also good with two Oscars wins to compare.  And its beyond belief how Theresa Russell did not get a supporting actress nomination and how an Oscar nod for the score by Jack Nitzsche did not occur.  The score has to rank up their with some of the greats.

Now based on the high star reviews here and other movie review sites I have seen, its seem now its a much more appreciated film with the recognition that Bill Murray and every associated with the film, thought it should of had 28 years ago. See it!!",1338163200,2,2495,4.147916666666666

The makers would have been better served to continue with that tack rather than backtracking to ""The Razor's Edge"" as the ambulance scene is probably the best part of this movie.  The resulting fiasco has an all too pervasive ""Animal House"" or ""Meatballs"" feel.  The soul of the story is totally absent.  The original version with Tyrone Power is a must see.  The book by Somerset Maugham is a must read.  This prattle should be taken from the market as an injustice.  I read somewhere the studio allowed Bill Murray to make this film as a reward for big box office moneymakers like Ghostbusters, Meatballs, and Stripes.  He went to a place he had no business in.  The deadpan arm dragging just doesn't cut it in a powerful story such as this.  It is a travesty.  Shameful.",1330646400,6,936,4.447058823529412

All the while, the contrasts are drawn between the vacuous world of high society and Larry's world (Murray's character).

My criticism of the film would be that it does not convey well the spiritual quest that is described in the book. I think this may be by design. The Film seems to walk the razors edge between following the journey described in the book, then glossing over the eastern wisdom in favor of dog whistle dialogue designed to make the film friendlier to the American Christian right which was growing in power as a movement when the film was released.

The film contains dialogue such as when the Buddhist monk tells Larry that the Path to Salvation is like the razors edge, Salvation, really?, Salvation is not a word I would use to describe Buddhist spirituality, however it is a word I would use if I was trying to bring familiarity to an audience unfamiliar with Buddhist teachings. Later in the film Larry explains that He thought that Isabelle was his reward for living a good life, but now he realizes that there is no reward, not here, not now. This seems a veiled reference to the fundamentalist Christian belief that Human suffering is God testing people to see if they are worthy of heaven, or as the old saying goes, ""suffer and get a high place in heaven"" No matter, References to having to die to receive your reward has no place in a film relating Larry's journey to find meaning in his life.

On the plus side by the end of the movie, Larry does seem to live in the moment. He seems present and available effortlessly doing what is appropriate to relieve the suffering of those around him, as you would expect from a man following the Buddha's teachings in the world.

Overall I like this film for what it is, However if you are interested in exploring this subject. Perhaps this film should be seen as a jumping in point as the 1946 film is truer to the story line of the Novel. Of course everyone should read the novel.",1311984000,,2058,4.365535248041775

Wow!  I think I was lucky to have avoided Murray's comic roles (I did see and like Lost in Translation and Groundhog Day) because I didn't have a lot of preconceptions to overcome.  Likewise I hadn't read the novel or see the Tyrone Power version of the film.  I was free to just take this as it was.

And it was .....beautiful.  I was captured by Murray's performance from the beginning.  You can tell that this was a labor of love on his part -- he is so present and intense that his performance touches one deeply.  The casting was perfect.  Theresa Rusell is perfect as the tragically poetic Sophie. (Wasn't the beautiful prostitute in Crime and Punishment also named Sophie?) Everyone else is perfectly cast, including the most despicable Isobel, Catherine Hicks.

I did have a bit of disappointment at the end when Murray's character walked through Paris in that same wooden, expressionless way.  Somehow that robotic walk which was so effective during most of the film, felt wrong in the end.  More movement would have been better.  Small quibble, though.  I really enjoyed the film and recommend it highly to anyone who is open to a serious, but sometimes light hearted version of the Maugham novel.",1295827200,,1431,4.713709677419355

513124,4,6302800498,"""The Razor's Edge"" is a very good movie that runs a solid two hours.  The movie is based on W. Somerst Maugham's classic novel of the same name.  It is sort of a existentional story that is hard to catch in a Hollywood film.  The script keeps your intereest, as the story spans many years and changes in the lives of three men.  The star, and person who ""carries the water"" in the film is Bill Murray.  Murray was cast in a dramatic, thoughtful role.  He shows how his talent is not limited to comedy and plays a well-to-do Chicagoan, Larry  Darrell.  Before WWI he is the usual happy-go-lucky young man with a beautiful girlfriend, Isabel. After Larry returns from the war, he is a changed man, looking for what is important and meaningful in life.  He leaves Isabel and travels to Paris, then later finds his guru and inner peace in Nepal, India.  While he is gone, many dramatic changes take place.  Isabel marries his best pal, Gray, and Sophie's husband and child are killed in a automobile accident.  Sophie hits bottom and becomes a drunk and a hooker.  Isabel thrives with Gray and has two beautiful daughters, and continues to live with her rich, social climbing Uncle Elliot.  When Larry comes back, he runs into Sophie at a Speak Easy.  She is living the low-life and he helps her climb out of a life of drugs, alcohol and violence toward women.  She is sober three months and they plan a life together.  Isabel, still in love with Larry, sabotages their plans and Larry confronts her with his sadness and pain.  He has learned from his guru that ""The path to salvation is narrow and hard to walk as a razor's edge.""

The casting for Isabel felt wrong and chemistry between her and Larry seemed off at first.  The relationship changes in the last half of the movie, and the scenes worked and the movie keeps your interest.  Again, Bill Murray did an excellent job - one should not come in with any pre-conceived notions on what to expect from him.",1294099200,,1958,4.505681818181818

513128,5,6302800498,"Cliche: I have never been a huge Bill Murray fan. I liked some of his movies but I did not love them. ""The Razor's Edge"" is a magnificent film! End cliche.

I mean that. It's not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was a war film. It is not. I thought it was a chick flick. It is not. It is much, much more than these. It actually turns out to be an epic; director John Byrum, and actors Bill Murray and Theresa Russell are the reasons why.

I won't write a synopsis of the motion picture; I will say that Bill Murray interjects just enough humor into the film to make it not as dark as it could have been. There are certainly some tragic tales and lessons here, but Larry Darrell (Murray) emerges as even more human than what his circumstances allow. His experiences serving in World War I disillusion him, so when he comes back home his life takes him on a different course than previously planned. He searches for himself, and that search takes him across the ocean to distant lands. He experiences severe hardship, disappointment and deep betrayal, but he NEVER complains.

Theresa Russell gives a heart-felt performance as Larry Darrell's fiance, Sophie. The countryside vistas are elaborate and breathtaking. I just don't want to say much more if you've never seen the film. I watched it many years ago, but it had a more profound effect on me when I watched it today.

India changes Larry's life, teaching him the difficult ""razor's edge"" path to salvation. Equipped with a new perspective on life and our place in the grand scheme of things he returns to Europe where he encounters his nearest and dearest American friends. The question is can Larry's newfound wisdom and understanding be applied to a Western world more attuned to the material pleasures, diversions and all the other assorted minutia it has become so identified with?

Critique: The '84 film `The Razor's Edge perfectly captures the spiritual angst of the early twentieth century lost in a post WWI world. The production values are first rate, the storyline touching and thoughtful and the acting excellent (Theresa Russell looks stunning). I found one of the most impressive elements of this film to be the nostalgic, highly evocative soundtrack. It's a magnificent collection that's definitely worthy of a spot in your CD collection.

In tackling the role of Larry Darrell, Bill Murray has reached beyond himself, both as an actor and as a person, to show us a deep exploration of the seeker within us all.

513154,5,6302800498,"Much has been written and documented about what has now become known as ""The Lost Generation"".These were the the American upper crust who,being disillusioned after ""The War to End All Wars"",World War 1, struggled vehemently in many ways to find meaning to their lives upon returning to peacetime America. Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald,Ernest Heningway are among some of the most famous authors to write on the shallow and meaningless existence of their society, and Somerset Maugham did the same in his THE RAZOR'S EDGE.

This 1984 adaptation of Maugham's 1940's novel really captures the essence of the intense inner and outer struggles that the wealthy and privileged of that generation had to endure. Lots of hopes and expectations were radically altered in what seemed like an instant after the War,and either the rich retuned to what they had known before in their upper stations in society,a pampered,opulent,insular and quite predictable road,  or they turned to an existential journey  that frequently lead down the path to ultimate ruin due to alcohol and opium in Bohemian society of Paris, or  to travel to Greece, India or Tibet to find ""God"".No matter which path was chosen,whether opting for life back in the comforts of American wealth ( eventually  ruined  at The Great Depression),or ""mind-expanding""wandering from the streets to the Temples,  each group found it treacherous to walk ""the razor's edge"" and survive it all.

Other reviewers have marvelously set forth the plot of Bill Murray's own adaptation of THE RAZOR'S EDGE (so I won't improve on their writings).No one could have played his character better. Too bad that the critics of 1984 did not see it that way ( much like the similar difficulties that Robin Williams and Adam Sandler first had in doing ""serious roles"").Murray KNEW and UNDERSTOOD Maugham's Larry and he performed the role to utter perfection. There is so much to commend Murray's rendition over the previous version,such as the outstanding cinematography, the Stanley Black musical score and the outstanding performances of Theresa Russel,Denholm Elliott and Catherine Hicks.....but most of all it is Murray's true understanding of the heart of the material and message that Maugham
intended. Could the film have been better? Probably only in the editing where vital scenes possibly were deleted in order to compact the film. But, even with that, this is a true masterpiece that seems to be appreciated so much more as the years go by (even by myself who was rather ambivilent about the film at the ""know-it-all"" age of then 29!!!).

Having since read Maugham's novel and learned so much more about this aimless and disheartened generation of dreamers,THE RAZOR'S EDGE has to be one of the finest expositions ever written or filmed on this subject. Anyone with an interest in ""THE LOST GENERATION"" will improve their knowledge vastly by watching Murray's THE RAZOR'S EDGE.

513168,4,6302800498,"Bill Murray's 1984 remake of the 1947 Tyrone Power vehicle based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 possibly fact-based novel of the same name, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is a consistently underrated film. By and large this is because Murray, universally considered as one of the finest comics of his generation, is cast (for the first time) in an unfamiliar dramatic role, a shift in paradigm not well accepted either by the critics or a large portion of the moviegoing public. Those who choose to penetrate their preconceptions will find that THE RAZOR'S EDGE is an intelligent and sensitive movie about generational dislocation and personal values.

Larry Darrell has returned from 1918's Western Front carrying a vast burden: That of a human life given up to save his own. Returning to his affluent American family and fiancee Isobel (Catherine Hicks) he finds that he simply cannot adopt the thin produce-and-consume values of the burgeoning Jazz Age, and so returns to 1920s Paris. After sampling the Moveable Feast, Darrell works as a laborer, living in pensions and devouring anything in print in his exploration of the life of the mind and the malady of the spirit. Eventually, he vanishes into the Orient.

In the interim, the jilted and angry Isobel has married Larry's friend, Gray Maturin (James Keach). Their mutual friend Sophie (Theresa Russell) has also married, in the wake of her unexpected pregnancy.

Their carefully arranged lives collapse suddenly as Isobel and Gray are left penniless after the Crash of '29. They flee to Paris, where they are sheltered by Isobel's wealthy, snobbish, but kindly uncle Elliott Templeton (Denholm Elliott).

Sophie is involved in a terrible auto accident that claims her husband and young son. Consumed with survivor's guilt, finding her values bankrupt, and with no internal compass to guide her, she turns to alcohol, opium and prostitution.

Larry suddenly reappears after a decade spent beyond the Lost Horizon. By chance, he reacquaints himself with Isobel and Gray, and soon after discovers the dissolute Sophie living on the streets. He gently guides her back toward life. As his relationship with Sophie grows, the vengeful Isobel sets out to destroy it.

Excellent performances are given by all the principals. Larry Darrell's character as created by Maugham has often been described as the prototype of the socially alienated seeker. Darrell may well be the inspiration for the Beats and the hippie counterculture of the 1950s and 1960s, but with a difference---he seems to have found a sense of himself, and in the end, grown comfortable in his own skin. Bill Murray does a fine job of showing us Larry's evolution from a spoiled and overindulged young man raised and existing in complacency, to the desperate quester of knowledge in books and unfamiliar places, and then to the quiet everyday yogin in wingtips that he becomes, living in society but not of it.

James Keach, in his limited role as Gray, is the quintessential American optimist. Denholm Elliott is the presumptuous American expatriate who can never quite leave his Midwestern roots behind (and although consumed with appearances, regards Larry with a peculiar respect). Isobel (Catherine Hicks) is a shallow and destructive [...], unable to accept Larry and abide his life, but intolerant and unforgiving of his choices. Theresa Russell (typecast as usual but still one of my favorite actresses) plays the fallen and redeemed Sophie with both gentleness and bemusement, the doppleganger to Larry's singleminded spiritual explorer.

A much finer film than it's limited exposure would indicate, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is not just about a man in search of himself---it is about a world that has not found itself.",1155427200,21,3722,5.150662251655629

And when the Buddhist monk says, ""The path to salvation is narrow and difficult, like walking the razor's edge,"" I say ""What salvation?""  Buddhism is not about salvation, it is about escaping sorrow by renunciation and following the 8 fold path.  I question the taste and knowledge of the reviewers who gave this show 5 stars.

Murray's movie brings much more humanity to the characters than the earlier Tyrone Power version; furthermore, the humour that Murray adds to Larry's character is indeed a welcome addition.  The movie version by Bill Murray, in short, does justice to the novel.

To me the book and Murray's movie version of it complement each other.  Read one, watch the other, and enjoy!",1145318400,8,607,4.688679245283019
513172,5,6302800498,"I have to put a review of this movie into the context of the W. Somerset Maugham novel from which it was adapted because both are rule-breaking works. Indeed, Maugham begins The Razor's Edge with the words, ""I have never begun a novel with more misgiving."" I read the book about 20 years ago, have re-read it several times, and to this day can't tell you if it is or is not markedly flawed in the way it was written. But I can tell you emphatically that I have never been more affected by any book. For about a week after reading it for the first time, I couldn't decide if it made any sense at all for me to be working in a bank. I remember finding only one other person who had read the book and found themselves similarly thwarted-a good person named Alexandra. Perhaps she will read this review and write one of her own.

This sense of ambivalence is reflected in the way that Bill Murray chose to adapt the story to suit his own interpretation of Maugham's vision. He takes a big risk in finding and or creating humor in the character of Larry Darrell-is this sense of humor appropriate for the period or is it too modern? I've seen the film a dozen times and still can't decide. But it does give the film a humanity and warmth that I find missing from the 1947 treatment starring Tyrone Power. One asks the same question of Maugham's decision to ""star as himself"" in his novel. By the way, Herbert Marshall deserves much credit for his portrayal of Maugham in the 1947 original film. And Murray deserves as much credit for avoiding a very literal re-make.

Some subtext that is largely forgotten: Murray claimed in a Rolling Stone interview upon the film's release that he had some horizon-expanding experiences while on location in Tibet-ironically paralleling his character's own experiences. If you didn't know, these characters and their story are all based on actual people that Maugham knew personally.

The cast is superb. Denholm Elliott, Catherine Hicks, Theresa Russell and James Keach truly capture their characters. Stand-outs in particular-because their characters were harder to portray-are Theresa Russell as Sophie (blows away Anne Baxter in the 1947 version) and believe it or not, James Keach as Gray Maturin. Keach had a smaller supporting role, but he manages to find just the right measure of human complexity in someone as uncomplicated as Gray was written- a gift that Maugham had with the written word.

Do I conclude this by revealing the eureka of the ending? The only thing I would rob you of is your own discovery-it is so subtle that you are almost tempted to read too much into it, but then again the more you see it the more its metaphor affects you. Despite all his setbacks, Murray climbs the famous stairs in Montmartre, first with small steps and then reaching the top with bounding exhuberance. He never quite gives up the path to salvation, does he? He understood the character far more than Maugham ever could. And for that sole insight he atones for any sins of interpretation he might have committed.",1142899200,8,3046,4.677238805970149

  This is a wonderful film, but it commits the cardinal error of demanding attention, thought and consideration from it's viewers.  Of course, it was a commercial failure.

  Having said that, thanks to Columbia for releasing it on DVD.  My tape was wearing out.

  Now, how about doing it again, and doing it right this time?

  Where are the extras?  Where is the commentary track from Bill Murray and John Byrum?  How about including deleted scenes, or at least the storyboards and script excerpts that were never used?  They're out on the internet; they should be on this disc.

  The film copy itself is not the best quality.

  Bill Murray is enjoying a revival.  People are starting to recognize him for the talent he truly is.  This is one of his first dramatic pieces, and it is his first non-comedic starring role.  It is a serious film with a loyal and dedicated following. It deserves better treatment than this.

  When ""Resident Evil 2"" can be released as a 2-Disc set, with tons of extras, why is a film of this quality being treated this poorly?

For me, the Bill Murray version of the Razor's Edge is a different angle on perhaps my favorite book. If you know Bill Murray, you will recognize the humor he brings to an otherwise relatively serious role.

While Bill Murray might be best known for films like Ghostbusters, he deserves much greater recognition for his role in The Razor's Edge; as much for his acting ability as his ability to adapt the script to his unique stage presence. While it is a favorite of mine, it should be recognized as one of the best films ever made (am I oveselling it?).

For those who have read Maugham's novel, the stuffiness and pretense are replaced with life, vibrance, and cinematic scope. This is one of those movies that struts films occasional superiority to the written word. Grand vistas, poignant staging (the final staircase exit), and again Bill Murray.

The movie retains all that is essential from the novel. Yet somehow, by not taking itself too seriously, Larry Darrel (Murray) is a more effective protagonist and philosopher. At each viewing I'm tempted to flee my cubicle for good and go in search of the meaning of life. Now that's power!

Ultimately, it seems a shame that such worthwhile films as this gather dust while Ghostbusters airs weekly on TBS and the like. Buy the DVD now (even with its shortcomings). You will at least be entertained by Murray's wisecracks (and a funny if brief performance from his brother Doyle).

513206,4,6302800498,"There's no need to go into a long synopsis of this movie, or to analyze Bill Murray's performance. This is a movie about a regular guy that suddenly has his world shattered, and so he sets off on a quest for wisdom. As for Murray's portrayal of the central role, Larry Darell, I thought it was perfectly fitting that a man most of us see as a kind of big-hearted clown is here cast as a spiritual adventurer. After all, must these two types by very different from each other? The movie works very well if you don't try to typecast Murray or go into the story with preconceptions about what kind of character Larry Darell is supposed to be. In fact, a big message in the story is about not being trapped by preconceptions about the way things are ""supposed to be"".
Some of the images in this movie are stunning, and there are times when I get the feeling that I'm looking at one of those Asian landscape paintings in which the tiny figure of a man sits in silent meditation among great mountains, a broad sky, and placid valleys. Without beating you over the head with it, the camera work constantly reminds you that life is bigger than you and that the world is full of wonders. The story reminds us that such wonders can be either beautiful or ugly, with many of them being both at the same time.
The reason I don't give it 5 stars? It left a lot of character development unaddressed, and the viewer simply had to fill in the blanks for many of Larry's challenges and realizations. If you don't find it tugging at your heart, and if you don't find yourself solemnly nodding at some of its poignant observations about life, and then laughing at some folly we all share, then it's not due the movie's shortcomings.",1086652800,10,1713,4.406940063091483

513208,5,6302800498,"Bill Murray is brilliantly casted in the role of the main character; a man seeking the meaning of life on a spiritual quest that sacrifices everything and everyone in his world.
There are significant differences between this film and the novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The narrator is not a character in the film as in the book. Larry Darell does not visit the Dalai Lama in the book as he does in the film, but rather spends several years in India living with a Hindu holy man. Larry's philosophical and religious revelations in the book stem from Hinduism rather than Buddhism, as in the film. There are also other significant small details that are not as obvious in the film as in the novel; for example, the effect of the Great Depression on Gray's family fortune and why he & Isabel must move to Paris and live with Uncle Elliot.
It would be a mistake to think of this movie as a sort of spiritual parallel to ""Seven Years in Tibet"". It's actually got more in common with the Great Gatsby. This isn't a story about a Westerner becomming turned-on by Eastern religion as much as it's a story about aristocratic Americans from Chicago living as expatriats in Paris in the years 1918-to-1930-something, (as seen through European eyes).
There are some fabulous acting performances in this film, foremost of which is Denholm Elliot in the role of Elliot Templeton (perhaps the best of his career). Bill Murray should have received on Oscar for his performance. Word on the street today is that what an incredible film ""Lost in Translation"" is, and how it shows a side of Bill Murray we haven't seen before, but I disagree. Those critics need to go back and have a look at ""The Razor's Edge"" and they will see that ""serious"" side of Murray, but in a much better-written and more moving story.

His portrayal of Larry Darrell is filled with vitality and authenticity. Somerset Maugham may not have mentioned the fact that Larry was occasionally known to scratch in public; Murray plays Darrell in a way that convinces me that the man was fully human, itches and all. Bill entertained in other movies; in this one, he proved he was a good actor. Everyone shines in this movie, but Bill Murray is the surprize. Add in the story, and the occasional engaging character, and you have a worthy addition to your movie library.

The cinematography is of the highest caliber - it is lush, sensual and with impeccable detail. I also must commend the soundtrack as it is wonderful with some excellent period renditions of popular 30's  era French songs. There have been very few films of this caliber to ever come along; clearly that it is not a mass market favorite is understandable; The film it is dealing with matters related to the soul and the awakening of a profound awareness in man; there are many hidden truths that are alluded to in this film which a student of esotericism or platonic philosophy would find much to chew over here. It is a warm, leave the movie and feel good film. It actually lacks some of the hard edge that the original has, and leaves the viewer with a warmer and more more optimistic outlook than the original 1930's version did. Exquisite viewing and a fine conversation starter afterwards!

513229,5,6302800498,"Like most moviegoers, when I heard Bill Murray was taking on the serious role of Larry Darrell in ""The Razor's Edge,"" I was skeptical.  I was a Bill Murray fan, but I couldn't imagine how the same goofy actor from ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Caddyshack"" was going to portray a young man transformed by war to become a globetrotting seeker on a quest for a way of life that would satisfy both his heart and his head.  The novel by W. Somerset Maugham had been filmed before, in 1946, with Tyrone Power as Darrell, and it was considered a pretty good film capitalizing on the Eastern-spirituality craze that swept Hollywood in the `40s.  Why do it again?, I thought.  But the more pre-film publicity I read about this 1984 version, the more I became interested in what the ""SNL"" alumnus would bring to the role.  It was obvious that Bill Murray--who signed on to do ""Ghostbusters"" only after Columbia Pictures agreed to let him do ""The Razor's Edge""--was committed to this story of spiritual transformation.  While most film critics don't like Murray's performance, seeing him as a comic actor out of place in a drama, I see his Larry Darrell as a serious man with a sense of humor.  Even before he witnesses the horrors of World War I, we see his lose-limbed, happy-go-lucky persona (which is true to the character Maugham created).  Upon returning home to America, Darrell is a changed man, but one who has not lost his sense of humor; indeed, it is all the more important to him, as he uses it to deal with his post-war life.  Sure, there is some anachronistic dialogue.  Yes, the script differs from the novel.  But the key elements are there: loyalty, forgiveness and most importantly, one man's search for himself.
This new DVD, which is short on extras, allows us to see the film in its original widescreen format, and that's bonus enough for me.  It's certainly a big improvement over the pan-and-scan VHS cassette we've had to endure.  Jack Nitzsche's sweeping score both captures the period and adds to the drama, and it sounds great here.  The movie--much of which takes place in Paris and India--makes excellent use of location shots (conspicuously absent in the 1946 version), and with the DVD we get some spectacular views of Kashmir, India, an area now entrenched in terrorism.  Interestingly, this version has Larry Darrell converting to Buddhism, giving audiences a chance to see the mountainous region of eastern Kashmir called Ladakh.  (Sometimes called ""Little Tibet,"" Ladakh is a lot like Tibet was before the Communist Chinese invasion, and ""The Razor's Edge"" gives us some inspiring views of this remote land.)
On the down side, though, the DVD transfer does not look as sharp as it could have.  There are many specs of dirt visible, and the film looks grainy at times.  This is disappointing, but not surprising for a film that made a mere $6 million at the box office back in 1984.  Perhaps Columbia/Tristar felt this movie was a flop, so why bother giving audiences the best DVD they could.  Still, this is an inspiring movie, and it's great to finally have it available on DVD.",1030492800,23,3101,4.75
513230,5,6302800498,"I absolutely loved this film when I saw it in the autumn of 1984.  The theatre was mostly empty because it wasn't GHOSTBUSTERS (from what I've read, Murray only agreed to do GHOSTBUSTERS if Columbia would finance RAZOR'S EDGE--so no one really lost on that deal!).  I remember both Roger Ebert & Gene Siskel raved about it, so not every critic was unkind.
Everyone just had a difficult time seeing Bill Murray in a dramatic role and never gave it a chance, which was their loss: I was completely absorbed by its classic story, its authentic locations, its beautiful score.  To see Murray in this role added another layer to the character and only made him more unique and interesting.  The cast couldn't have been better.
I'm so glad to see it hit DVD but I'd really hoped to hear a commentary from Murray and director/co-screenwriter John Byrum.  This is obviously a labor of love and it would've been very illuminating to hear from them.  Regardless, this is a wonderful film and I look forward to taking the journey again on DVD.",1026950400,13,1032,4.642857142857143
513231,4,6302800498,"A good film version of the Maugham classic with gorgeous cinematography ,excellent casting and acting, this Razor's Edge is very entertaining and thought provoking. Bill Murray seems a strange choice to play Larry but ultimately plays him to perfection . The other actors all do quite well in their character portrayals. This is an admirable effort to transfer a complex and unusually structured work of fiction to the screen that succeeds to an extraordinary extent. However I felt that the ommission of the author's veiwpoint and narration as written in the novel distorted the story to a degree.",1023753600,3,598,5.112244897959184

I liked Bill Murray's portrayal - he had the right amount of levity at the right time imho. Going through life in a perpetual dour mood is assuredly not fun to watch nor fun to be around.  Movies like this, and books on similar topics, are far more likely to help break the ennui of existence than yet another trip to Disney or yet another action flick.",1021420800,,535,4.184466019417476
513233,3,6302800498,"This movie was poorly reviewed by critics when it came out in 1984, and I had little interest to see it until I recently read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham.  Bill Murray plays Larry, a young man who fights in WWI and comes back a changed man.  Following the war, he begins a spiritual quest for the meaning of life, which leads him to Eurpoe and Asia.  He later meets up again with some of his American friends in Paris, where the film's denouement takes place.
It's always a pretty interesting movie; however, Murray is severely miscast.  In the book, Larry is a very genial and sincere guy, but Murray plays him as a bit of a clown.  His performance makes the film too erratic in tone.  Fans of the novel will also likely be disappointed by several changes - the author is not present in the film and Elliot's role is greatly diminished.  Overall, fans of Murray and the novel are likely to be let down.",1019952000,8,908,4.369047619047619
513234,4,6302800498,"I recently had the pleasure of seeing this film on one of those  pay channels that was having a free viewings for a couple of days.  I knew nothing about it and it was one a.m. so I stuck a tape in the VCR and called it a night.  How fortunate for me. It was delightfull and I watched it more than once.  ...While their were signifigent differences between the book and the film the things the film included added were well thought out and touching... [And] the tranference of the narative from the author and some of his sceans ( the book was largly a first person narritive of the author with various long monologs by other characters) worked very well.  Oddly enough (considering the years each came out) the film lacked some degree of the sexuality of the book but over all it was a true rendition.  ...The rest of the acting was fair.  Theresa Russell was as good as she usually is ( but not up to her role in Insignifigence) and Cathrine Hicks was as bad as she usuallyis....
  I recommend this movie whole heartedly.  Other than Hicks the only real weakness was that it was rather unclear if Murry followed the Buddah or Hinduism, but as both embrace the transmigration of souls, temples, yoga, etc, from the film stand point it really didn't matter.  One thing this film did for me was creat an interest in exploring eastern philosophies.  ...",1019433600,,1351,4.469387755102041

513237,5,6302800498,"First off I think Murray was excellent, I believe he intended to keep his portrayal of Larry Darrell a bit aloof or understated.  I think one of the most interesting scenes of the movie is when Darrell is holding his friend and mentor (can't remember his name) who is dying in the foxhole after having just saved Larry's life.  I have always liked to believe a rumor that Murray used the death of John Belushi for inspiration during that scene.

513238,5,6302800498,"If you are an intelligent viewer who is looking for a significant and possibly mind expanding movie event then ""The Razor's Edge"" is for you.  It has remained one of my favorite films for fifteen years, and I have owned it and replayed it many times.  If you look at the viewer feedback for this film you will find that the vast majority of people rate is as ""Excellent"" (76% of imdb raters give it a 10/10 rating) those who fail to see it's qualities can be divided fairly equally into the ""don't get it"" camp (Unlike the typical Hollywood lowest denominator flick, the minimum IQ for viewing is Razor's Edge is probably 100, and that leaves  the population out) and the ""disappointed"" crowd, who have so typecast the star (Bill Murray) that they wanted ""Caddyshack"" and just can't allow him to be a serious actor.  You must set aside you prejudices and give the man a chance-Bill Murray is a Harvard grad, he co-wrote the screen play-this was a labor of love for him.  Just because he has a sense of humor does NOT make him a lightweight, as this film demonstrates for anyone with the eyes to see it. Based upon the 1942 W. Somerset Maugham novel, it follows the evolution of a spoiled upper class boy from Illinois (Larry, Bill Murray), who volunteers to be an ambulance driver in WW I for a little ""fun and adventure"" and instead gets a dose of PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).  His world was forever changed by the events he experienced.  He literally could not go home again after the war.  He tried, and found the lives of those around him to be shallow and meaningless, and their pursuits and interests just trivial.  There had to be a reason why he was here, and this sets the stage for the real point of the movie, which is an exploration of the meaning of life. (I told you it wasn't Caddyshack!)  Obsessed with these existential issues, and finding that alcohol did not make the need go away, Larry travels to Paris, and starts to read, serious books on philosophy and religion, supporting himself as a laborer.  He does not care much for his surroundings-his lack of materialism is in marked contrast to his peers and friends from before, whose dreams are to grow wealthy in the stock market.  An early Bohemian.  I found this particularly poignant: to watch this movie that foreshadowed the tech boom and bust, and realize a whole new crass materialistic generation's world was just as rocked by a stock market crash AFTER this movie was made!  His fiance could not deal with this, and left him, to marry someone she did not love but who had money.  Another contrast to the shallow and materialistic, which is a recurring theme throughout the film-what brings happiness to a man?  Larry's journey took him to India, and Hindu religion, and then on to Tibet to discover Buddha-the scenes filmed there are absolutely breathtaking, so I hope you can find a letterbox laserdisc or they finally bring this out on DVD-it is worth it to see the whole screen. There is romance, and love, and loss.  I won't reveal the ending, which is truly bittersweet, and a bit nihilistic.  This is truly the best thing this fine actor ever accomplished, and I rate it a strong ""10"".  This should have won many awards, and should also be considered a true classic; I am disappointed in my fellow man that they so typecast the star that they could not see what a great contribution he made with this effort here.  Not light fare, and a long film, but one worth seeing.",992736000,266,3465,4.567043618739903

It is an execellent depiction of how a life can change through tragedy.  Larry has been put in an aweful situation, but miraculously, changes his life for the better, becoming a well rounded man.  It is an excellent movie.  Larry has found a new person within himself that he never knew existed, and now is helping others to do the same.

The soundtrack is marvelous and moving, the cinematography is great, and the ""supporting cast"" performances of Denholm Elliott, Peter Vaughan, and Saeed Jaffrey are outstanding. Murray wasn't great but if you like him at all then you'll probably like the film. Casting Bill Murray as the lead was smart because Somerset Maughm's character rejects a mainstream life for a life less traveled, and Murray's smart alecky devil may care humor allows the character to reject a materialist style of life without being elitist and rejecting the people who have chosen that lifestyle. Anyway the film is not for everyone, but if you love Bill Murray obviously pick it up and if you have any counter-cultural leanings I strongly recommend picking it up and while you are here pick up Somerset Maughm's book!",969926400,6,847,4.971830985915493

There were at least  three times during the movie where I broke out into a giggle, because I  understood the message, and when I tried to explain it to those watching it  with me, I just got odd looks.
It's a profound movie on a number of  levels, but if you're looking for a ""message"" movie like Denzel  Washington's ""The Siege,"" or a Bill Murray movie like  ""Ghostbusters,"" you're looking in the wrong place. It's a very  introspective movie, and if you're not into those, You won't enjoy  ""The Razor's Edge.""",966470400,5,626,4.576576576576577

The movie gives  you pause to reflect upon yourself and almost compells you to examine your  everyday actions-days after you have finished the movie. It is a movie  about a person in search of himself and his attonement, and it's effect on  others around him.

Even conceding the abbreviated treatment of what is a much larger project thematically, young Bill Murray was apparently incapable of doing this role justice. Like most American screenplays, especially for that time (""The Prince of Tides"" is an excellent comparison), it's a rapid-fire march through the book's major characters, quotes, and plot developments - many if not most of them altered wholesale - for a few scenes of syrupy sentimental payoff at the end. Not a terrible movie by any means, just not nearly as good as it might have been in more capable hands. That said, it's remarkable that this movie ever got made in the first place. Really tough subject matter to do justice to in the space of 120 minutes, especially for an American movie-going audience who is the not-so-cleverly concealed implied butt of the underlying thematic joke.",1518739200,,930,5.006451612903226
