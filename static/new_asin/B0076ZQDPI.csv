5058748,3,B0076ZQDPI,"I saw trailers of this movie with the hot steamy scenes with Elizabeth Rohm, one of my favorite hotties. The movie does disappoint me from the perspective of the sizzle scenes. After the initial intimate scenes, the movie bored me and I stopped watching midway through. In all fairness, a lot of movies bore me. Women on the other hand may like it and I will concede that their perspective may be better or at least different than mine.",1388534400,,436,4.531645569620253
5058749,5,B0076ZQDPI,"I really liked this movie primarily because it features my favorite actress, Elizebeth Rohm.  I fell in love with her since her Law and Order days.",1367452800,3,147,4.653846153846154
5058750,2,B0076ZQDPI,"While this video may be touted as having a lot of nudity and mildly kinky sex, in fact most of the carnal stuff is compressed into a few jump-cut moments early in the video. Afterwards, we're treated to an its-been-done-before-and-better story of a husband descending into obsessive madness over his wife's imagined infidelity. I'll be honest: I didn't get this for all the voice-over yammering on the part of the husband as he goes on and on and on.",1354752000,4,450,4.708860759493671
5058751,5,B0076ZQDPI,"If you're not yet a fan of Danny Huston, you will be after seeing this film! His interpretation of a man singularly obsessed with the carnal desire of the woman he married is unflawed and frighteningly realistic. Life goes on around him; his children, his business, his friends-but he can see only ONE thing. It's amazing to watch-as he also narrates-you can almost see the gears of his mind turning his dilemma over and over until his obsession finally consumes him. So absolutely obsessively-compulsively intense. Fans of this type of film will not be disappointed.",1349308800,8,567,4.978947368421053
