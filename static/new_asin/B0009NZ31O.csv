2303385,2,B0009NZ31O,Product arrived on time but in less than perfect condition it skips and stutters alot.  But it doesn't bother the kids just my husband and myself.,1256342400,,146,4.615384615384615
2303386,5,B0009NZ31O,"I bought this because it stars the band KISS.  Our whole family are KISS fans, and love them being in a Scooby Doo show.",1256342400,5,120,4.0

2303388,5,B0009NZ31O,"My grandosn loves Scooby-Doo, and this disk is no exception.  In fact, he took it home with him.  It has the same high quality of all Scooby cartoons, and the monsters are just scarey enough to be fun and not really scare the child.  We buy all the Scooby we can for the sense of adventure and because the monsters are always proved to be nothing to be afraid of.",1129161600,7,363,4.1571428571428575
2303389,4,B0009NZ31O,My kids love the movie and watch it all the time.  I even bought one as a gift.  I thought it was great that they had the old rock group Kiss in it.  What a flashback!,1127952000,,167,3.5833333333333335
2303390,4,B0009NZ31O,"This DVD is full of surprises some good, one not.  I liked all the episodes especially the first one with a cameo by KISS at a halloween party.  The only part I didn't like was the laugh track.  Why on earth would you have a laugh track on a Scooby Doo cartoon?  Its insulting.  But overall a great DVD",1125446400,3,302,4.0508474576271185
2303431,5,B0009NZ31O,My baby loves it! Great collection in this volume. Recommend to everyone young and old alike.. Can't go wrong with Scooby doo.,1398556800,,126,4.7727272727272725
2303432,4,B0009NZ31O,"This is a mainly good collection of episodes I didn't have yet. My only complaint is that they started recycling episodes on these volumes. There is an episode on this one that is also on another one I already have. I wish they wouldn't do that because I collect these for my daughter, who LOVES Scooby and the gang, and we want all different episodes (duh). Otherwise, there is no point in buying them anymore.",1392076800,,411,4.493333333333333

2303437,5,B0009NZ31O,"The Halloween episode is awesome, with Daphne jealous over Velma's hot cousin all over ""her Freddie""... ;) So cute! And ""What's New Scooby Doo"" is a good transition into more modern times, unlike some of the movies or ""Mysteries Inc."" (which just got so much wrong it's not even funny...)",1337644800,,288,4.78
