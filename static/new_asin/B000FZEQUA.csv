2593250,4,B000FZEQUA,"I'm a music teacher and I have shown both episodes in my classroom.  Overall I enjoy them, but some parts of the episodes are drawn out and not very interesting for my students.  I often skip parts to keep their interest.",1363046400,4,221,4.365853658536586
2593251,5,B000FZEQUA,"This is such a wonderful show, and the episodes on this DVD are great! We enjoyed the music and the book reading and review (Hip Cat is a fantastic book); the interview with jazz musician Joshua Redman is wonderful. My little one loved it; it was a great introduction to jazz for her. I definitely recommend this DVD and indeed this series.  It introduced us to some great stories for children. I bought this DVD along with copies of the two books that were read in the episodes, and it made a great present!  Educational and enjoyable!",1359590400,10,536,4.515463917525773
