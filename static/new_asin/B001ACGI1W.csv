8276597,5,B001ACGI1W,"While this film won't ever be classified as a ""hit"", I can't help but love it. It is genuine and shows true love like you hear your grandparents talk about. My two favorite scenes are the anniversary scene on the bridge, and the scene of the morning he leaves for active duty and she tries to make his breakfast. Joan Fontaine is a true, classic beauty, no frills lady. I can't say enough good this about this movie. If you want action or comedy or spectacular cinematography, watch something else. This movie is not flashy, but very beautiful and will leave you feeling warm and grateful for life's simple joys.",1350864000,3,612,4.572727272727272
