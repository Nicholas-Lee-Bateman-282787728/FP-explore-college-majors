7873354,1,6304498942,"Don't Waste a Dime on this so called Movie! ""Paris Texas"" had more going on than this show! I can't stand the way parents tell their kids no, and everyone knows they don't mean it. Then when the child does it, there is NO mention of it! No fussing, no punishment; except sometimes other adults get fussed at for ""letting"" the child do wrong.
  That is what this movie is about - the girl is quiet, but rebellious.  The mom is Lazy! She ignores the girl for hours on end - even left her home alone for an hour or more (She is 5 yrs old!)!  Then she tells the girl something to do or not do and the child does the opposite. Nothing more is said. The boyfriend gets in trouble a few times cause the Mom walked off, the girl does what mom said not to, and she blames the boyfriend! When he finds the girl home alone and playing with matches, he walks over, and lights his pipe from the lit match in her hand!
  This is LONG and BORING!  The parent child relationship is very Irritating to me - especially since it is very typical of today's family.  On top of it all, They all seem to be on mega doses of downers!  I would rather spend an hour watching a snail walk.",1418601600,,1162,4.083700440528634

It is really the story of Hamlet if Hamlet was not the prince of Denmark but instead a small girl living with her mom in a charming mid-1950s Manhattan apartment.

And it is oddly similar to Francoise Sagan's Bonjour Tristesse, in which the heroine will do anything, and I mean anything, to make sure her father doesn't re-marry, and the tension is between her hatred of Deborah Kerr and her growing admiration for her, even though she has vowed to destroy her.  Her the little girl is determined to get Larry out of her life even if it means destroying her mother's main chance for a happy new life.  And yet she likes Larry and has many good times with him.  He buys her a miniature sailboat, and a dancing bear doll that claps cymbals together--from the old Macy's toy department--clever product placement of the Macy's bag.  He reads to her, jokes with her, but maybe Peggy knows that deep down he doesn't really like her and his affectionate-seeming banter is only part of his ploy to win her mother's heart.  Ann (the mother, played by Lori March) is bright enough, but in some ways she's dumb as a post.

Oh, those lollipops!  Stanley Kubrick had Lolita licking a lollipop, but little Peggy plants hers, stick down, in the sand at Jones Beach, and then washes off the sand by sticking them under the incoming waves.  No wonder Ann gets so upset with Larry!  I didn't understand exactly what it was about Larry's father.  Larry wanted Ann to meet his father but to make no mention of Peggy?  So whatever happened to that plot, it just went the way of the lollipops I guess.  The film itself remains as a great open window into a long-ago bourgeois dream of Manhattan without crime, without dirt, without race, a Jamesian New York modeled on the London of What Maisie Knew.",1241481600,,2044,4.525885558583107
7873357,5,6304498942,"One of my all time favorite flicks is ""Little Fugitive"" which  was a major inspiration on the French New Wave. ""Lovers and  Lollipops"" is from the same filmmakers. It is not as immediately novel  as ""Little Fugitive"" but just as satisfying overall.
""Lovers and Lollipops"" is about the burgeouning romance  between a beautiful widow (Ann) and an old friend (Larry) and the angle  from which Anne's 8 year old daughter Peggy sees this significant event.  Peggy becomes a force to be reckoned with, sometimes charming and sometimes  annoying the hell out of Larry, who knows he has to win over the daughter's  heart as well as the mother's. This might seem cliche, but the way it is  handled by Engel and Orkin, is anything but, even to this day.
The  semi-documentary style is fabulous and very much influenced by Italian  Neo-Realism. Everything was shot on location, on the streets, guerrila  style. The outlook of Engel and Orkin, however, is very far from  Rossellini's or DeSica's. It is non-cynical and quintessentially  'American.' Yet for all that it is not fake and romantic in a harmful way.  It is simply the other side of the coin without any mawkish embellishments  and nonsense.
Engel and Orkin's unique wit, authentic feel for the  characters and the fact that they managed to capture what it was like to  live in New York City at this, quite innocent period in American history,  all add up to make ""Lovers and Lollipops,"" a unique experience.  In fact, there are shots and scenes in this movie that are some of the most  poetic I've ever seen anywhere. The long shot at the museum, for example,  of Larry, Ann and the security guard trying to help Peggy get her boat out  of the water, where the maxim 'comedy is life in long shot' is demonstrated  so effectively; or the scene where Peggy is mouthing all the words Larry is  reading her, and Larry realizing this, speeds up his reading, making her  laugh uncontrollably, unable to keep up. The romance between Ann and Larry,  though on the surface a perfect match, is handled with maximum care and  made authentic at every turn. The seeds of what might become its undoing  are made apparent at every stage, especially with regards to Peggy, who  almost succeeds in breaking it up.
Overall, a definite MUST SEE,  especially for anyone interested in authenticity in 1950s American films,  something you will not find in 99.9% of period Hollywood product.",969235200,10,2418,4.779661016949152
