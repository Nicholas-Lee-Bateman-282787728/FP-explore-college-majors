I give it 4 stars mostly because of the nostalgia from when I watched it as a kid.  I watched the streaming version via prime video.

Video and audio quality wasn't very good, but it was still enjoyable.",1523318400,,362,4.128571428571429
8179736,2,B000067IWM,"Despite the poor reviews, I purchased this movie with an opened mind.  This movie had the foot prints of a very promising old school ""kickers""!!  I was especially impressed by the kung fu moves, which gave me a renewed respect for the monkey style.  Despite the impressive training, especially the drunken monkey, I thought the final fight scene fell really short.  It almost seemed like the director cut out a hugh chunk of the fight scene, and the movie ended! The expectation was set,,and I fell for it. I'm  happy it only cost me $3.98 for this ""BUMBO-CLOTH"" flick!!",1146700800,,570,4.717171717171717
8179737,2,B000067IWM,This was ok and probably just about worth $4.99.  Decent fight scenes but as I said there are better kung-fu movies around.,1082160000,2,123,4.590909090909091
