8532589,5,B008YMHBEE,I bought this for my older grandchildren when they were younger.  I'm buying this DVD for my 2 year old granddaughter knowing she will enjoy it's animated characters and as she gets older she will learn the meaning of doing the right thing.  I would recommend this to anyone who has small children.  I recommend this story very highly!,1432598400,,335,4.6440677966101696
