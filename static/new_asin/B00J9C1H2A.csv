6339670,5,B00J9C1H2A,If you're into 3D Blu-Rays check these out.  They're both very good though Under the Sea is a bit more entertaining. But the double package is well worth the price. I find them both relaxing and enjoyable to watch.,1409875200,12,214,4.487179487179487

6339682,5,B00J9C1H2A,Great 3D and extremely clear close-ups.,1466121600,,39,5.666666666666667
6339683,3,B00J9C1H2A,"Both of these films boasts top actors as narrators. Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and Jim Carey and they all do fine jobs but honestly  their voices added very little to either film.  Jim Carry was the most entertaining and enthusiastic, while Johnny sounded  a bit bored.

The photography is beautiful in both films.  The 3D has lots of depth although nothing is going to appear to be floating around the living room. Under The Sea is overly obsessed with cuddle fish when many other interesting creatures are ignored.  Deep Sea was not as pretty but had a bit more variety.

Both films are visually striking in 3D and are a very pleasant ride (or swim) but there is really nothing new for underwater enthusiasts.  Allot of cuties deigned to tug on the heart especially the white Australian seals and the beautiful Dragon Fish.  There are also many examples of the symbiotic relationship between a wide variety of creatures.

Then the lectures begin on man-made global warming. Both films are guilty of this but Under The Sea is the far far worse.  Whether you buy into climate change as being man-made or not, this really hurt the experience in watching both these films.  The lecturing especially turned Under The Sea into a downer.  Neither DVD was advertised as a climate change film so this felt like a bait and switch, and came off as propaganda.

Sadly the climate lectures are depressing helping to make both films ""one views"" and probably not something you would want to share with friends.  I suggest the far superior Mysteries Of the Unseen World as a far better and upbeat film if your goal is to simply to show off your 3D home theater system.  Forest Whiticar is an inspiring narrator and the 3D photography and surround sound are phenomenal. No fish though.",1465689600,3,1769,4.713355048859935

6339687,3,B00J9C1H2A,"The Three Stars are for Content. Would be four stars, but....read on.
The two films, which total an hour and a half, are excellent, quite beautiful with strong, immersive 3-D.  However, the discs were sent as two separate but taped-together regular amaray cases rather than the pictured lenticular slip-cover that should have been with them and was the main reason I bought these at this time.
So, while I love the product I feel cheated because Amazon's third party slipped up this time by sending me something that was NOT ""as advertised.""
If I can't get what I ordered, I'll not use third party purchasing again.",1463443200,3,615,4.80188679245283

6339689,4,B00J9C1H2A,Of the two DVD the Deep Sea 3D wasn't as good as the other but they were both fun to watch. The fish seem to swim in the middle of the room. It's worth having both DVDS and experiencing the 3D effect.,1463011200,,200,3.7857142857142856
6339690,3,B00J9C1H2A,Great 3d effects.  The video has a climate change agenda which was an anoying disruption from the video.  That is why I did not give it a 4 or 5,1461715200,4,144,3.7666666666666666

6339703,4,B00J9C1H2A,"These movies were pretty much everything we had hoped for in a Blu-ray to show off our 3D projector, just in a smaller amount than we had thought. Each movie is only ~40 minutes with a few counting for beginning and end credits. The imagery is beautiful and the 3D is better than any disc that we own (and we own ~10 3D blu-rays including Jurassic World, Avengers 1&2, GotG, and several Pixar/Dreamworks movies). I've also seen several reviews saying that Under the Sea was better than Deep Sea. We actually liked Deep Sea more. The 3D on both is amazing with images projecting 80-90% out of the screen. Several scenes actually require you to back up, and many hurt your eyes due to the amount happening on screen (thousands of tiny fish, etc.). We would definitely buy these again, but I gave this 4 stars because of how short each film is. It left us wanting much more, but without a doubt, these will be the movies that we break out to show off the 3D features on our home theater.

P.S. Jim Carrey narrates Under the Sea, and he seems to be using his creepy, ""hey kids get in my van,"" voice.",1446336000,,1095,4.367647058823529

6339716,5,B00J9C1H2A,"Of the five ""starter"" 3d movies purchased, this was the highest quality.  From cuttlefish to codfish, your living room becomes a live aquarium.  This demonstrates the capability of home theater 3D entertainment.  Too bad more commercial movies aren't up to this standard.  Avatar is the only one I have seen that even comes close.  Guess the market demand doesn't justify the investment level.  Prices on commercial 3D movies, although higher don't always justify their quality, it is really hit or miss out there.",1434067200,20,514,5.132530120481928
6339717,4,B00J9C1H2A,Great for all ages. It's easier to watch in 3D when the subject matter isn't zooming and panning real fast like on a action film.,1433980800,,129,4.2

6339722,4,B00J9C1H2A,"Deep Sea 3D has the best 3D effect I have ever seen on a home TV. The potato grouper came into my living room and stopped  about a foot in front of me! Better than the Imax theater. I froze the shot, stood up and put my hand in the fishes mouth. The movie was good but I would have bought it for this one shot. I have watched dozens of 3D movies on my LG 70"" TV. They are all good but now I wonder why they all don't have the ""in your face"" movie theater quality 3D.",1429315200,11,466,3.707070707070707

My favorite sequences in the Imax Under the Sea were:  1) the Potato Cod, it feels like he is right in front of your nose,  2) the sea lion scene at the end is very cool and feels like they coming out of the screen.  Very cool and informative with a good amount of out of screen effects.",1428796800,4,428,3.976470588235294

Both movies are IMAX productions and have good underwater cinematography and 3D effects. Under the Sea is a newer movie and has more eye popping 3D effects than Deep Sea but both are equally entertaining and informative.

I've shown these movies to young and old, kids, teens, parents and even grandparents, everybody loves to watch them and gets caught up in the spectacular visuals ... It's like scuba diving from the couch in your living room.

Both these blu-ray discs are available separately - but this 2 disc set is priced only a few dollars more and a single disc making it an excellent value.",1427846400,6,679,4.595041322314049

6339749,4,B00J9C1H2A,"The price of this double feature IMAX 3D film made it a  more attractive purchase to try it for my newly acquired Samsung 75"" UN8550 UHD TV than purchasing the two disc separately since there were a lot of raving reviews about it's 3D-ness as compared to other 3D discs of the same subject.  Well, I have to disagree with the people that seem to think that this movie is of higher quality than other 3D presentations. In my opinion it its of the same quality as most good 3D presentations except that in the IMAX tradition, they still seem to think that their mostly just 40 minutes or sometimes even shorter movies are worth so much more than other, at least 60 min. documentaries of other companies. Good for them that some people still fall for the notion that more expensive is better. My opinion is that IMAX makes some GOOD documentaries but in general they are ALWAYS still overprized.",1417996800,3,892,4.53416149068323
