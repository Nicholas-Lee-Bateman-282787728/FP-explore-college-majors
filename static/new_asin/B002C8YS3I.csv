The character development is pretty slow in the beginning but the characters do grow.  This is the beginning of their adventures to find ancient artifacts, and includes the entire first season.

Lok and Sophie seek the help of Dante Vale to help them on their journey to become better seekers and follow the mysterious path of Lok's father Ethan.  A fun adventure but definitely for a younger audience.",1393459200,,530,4.791208791208791
8363596,4,B002C8YS3I,"I think this is a great video for kids.  I found it a bit melodramatic and silly at times (which I think means I need to go hunting for my inner child).  It reminded me a whole lot of the Saturday morning cartoons I used to watch.  In a good way.  It's got more character development than usual and some nice animation.  The plot seems solid enough and should interest younger viewers.  This is a good title, but just not my thing.",1319414400,2,431,4.195121951219512

There is an English subtitle track, and a Spanish audio track, which is fun to listen to if you are learning Spanish and have seen the show before, so you know what's going on. The opening theme song in Spanish is atrocious (off key and painful), but the voice overs thorugh the rest of the show are great. In the extras, they have the opening theme song sung in Italian, German and Spanish. I really like the Italian and German. There is also an original concept trailer, where Lok has brown hair and is named Jason, but the concept of the show is the same. It's odd to hear other people talk for the characters in this trailer, but that's part of the fun. I gave this DVD to a friend who had never seen the show but likes anime, and she liked it very much. I hope you enjoy it as well.",1263945600,4,869,4.14792899408284
