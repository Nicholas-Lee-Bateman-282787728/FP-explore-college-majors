7101031,1,B00VQ4RH8C,"I have to admit that I bought this movie for myself. I am 71 & love dog movies. I am so disappointed in this movie. All I saw ,myself was almost an exact storyline as Beethoven's 4th, which to me was more realistic & I thought the antics were more ""stupid"" than ""funny"", & I am going to give it to my granddaughter & hope she likes it.",1434326400,2,335,3.9411764705882355
7101032,5,B00VQ4RH8C,"My family likes & owns ""The Dog Who Saved Easter"" & this movie is even better than that one.  It's somewhat similar to The Karate Kid & even has the evil Sensei (Martin Kove) from Karate Kid (1984) in this movie.  This is a really funny & cute movie.  I recommend it.",1433289600,4,267,4.096153846153846
7101033,5,B00VQ4RH8C,"This is such a cute movie for kids.  My boys also have The Dog that Saves Easter and watch it even though Easter is over.  They were super excited when this DVD arrived and said it was just as good as the Easter one.

**I was sent this product in exchange for a honest review. The opinions above are my own.**",1433203200,3,309,4.032786885245901
7101034,5,B00VQ4RH8C,Loved it.  A great family show.  Love when they have to take the dog to obedience school.  Also love where they catch the burglars in the end.  Thought it was especially funny when the dog causes them to drop all the presents in the pool.,1432944000,5,238,4.222222222222222
7101035,2,B00VQ4RH8C,We recently lost our lab so we were excited to watch a lab movie.  The lab was cute but the movie was NOT.  Didn't finish watching it.,1453334400,,134,3.925925925925926

7101038,5,B00VQ4RH8C,"Really enjoyed this one! I was worried it would suck since after a series does so many sequels, they lose their touch, but it surprised me. This is every enjoyable, fun and very cute. And it's nothing like Beethoven's 4th, I don't understand why a reviewer said this. Great for kids or animal lovers of all ages",1440633600,2,311,4.473684210526316

8710857,4,B00VQ4RH8C,"Fun comedy for the whole family, but aimed mostly for the younger age group (probably best for ages 7-11.)  If you have seen the old ""Karate Kid"" movies from the 80's, you'll notice a VERY familiar theme here - in this case, the dog taking the place of the Karate Kid - needing to learn certain tasks that will help him at the showdown.  A few characters from the original Karate Kid also make appearances in this flick!",1531526400,,420,4.371794871794871
8710858,3,B00VQ4RH8C,the movie is ok but it isn't as good as the others.  maybe the next one will be funnier.  my family loves all of the other zeus movies we would love to see more.,1517875200,,161,3.7058823529411766

8710862,5,B00VQ4RH8C,Such a cute kids/ family movie. It's sort of like a Karate Kid with dogs in place of the kids. In fact it has some of the original Karate Kid cast in it.,1478995200,,153,3.6666666666666665
