8040642,5,6303814298,"Episode 4 sends Chiaki and her crew racing after a valuable piece of pottery, the ""Jar of Desires.""  The most desirable thing about this pot is the price it can fetch to the right seller, and Chiaki's  relatives desperately want that jar to ""benefit the temple.""  (And their pocketbooks, of course!)  Once Gohra and his demon seeds enter  the picture, though, the following antics are enough to ""make King  Midas himself run for his life!""  Perhaps Chiaki has a taste for  silver instead?
Episode 5 brings everyone back to the temple for some  relaxing, quiet, peace-filled days - well, maybe in Sailor Moon, but not in  this series!  Zenki can't control his hunger and begins to eat Chiaki and  her grandmother to the brink of poverty, and even chaining the refrigerator  shut doesn't stop him!  In desperation, Zenki secretly follows Chiaki to  school in order to raid the cafeteria.  A demon seed enters the picture and  Zenki ends up with more troubles than math class ever served up.
The best  part of episode 5: how many times have you seen a demon lord in a  dress?
Check out this video and you won't be sorry!  (Well, unless you  have something against demons in drag...)  The voice talent is wonderful,  the animation is superb, and the plot is hillarious!",928108800,,1265,4.701834862385321
