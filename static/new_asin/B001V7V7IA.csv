8441354,5,B001V7V7IA,Loved this show. I found it by accident and had to use subtitles since I don't speak Spanish. But it was well worth it. I couldn't stop watching. But you have quite a few plots and twists to keep up with. Missing one episode and you could be lost.,1520553600,,247,4.061224489795919

8441356,5,B001V7V7IA,This was an amazing series from the moment you watch the first episode you are hooked! I was addicted!!!! I've never seen a better show. It has so many twists that it keeps you intrigued 100% every single episode is full of suspense! I loved it.

8441358,4,B001V7V7IA,"I found this series by accident and am only on episode one, but they are setting up an interesting plot with a lot of twists.  Decent acting and good writing, with some lines that make me smile.  Obviously, it has been popular in the native country since its listed as seven seasons.  I'm not sure I want to get involved with that much of a long-term commitment to a show.  But it really does look like a good one. (Just wondering what private school would allow girls to wear uniform skirts that barely cover their butts.  Just sayin)",1440892800,,535,4.418367346938775
