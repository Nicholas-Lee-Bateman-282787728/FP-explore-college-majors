1633563,4,B00005NFY3,"Thus my four-star rating. Otherwise, this excellent video collection contains TEN classic episodes of I LOVE LUCY. While some fans may find some of their favourite episodes excluded (for example, I have SALES RESISTANCE, LUCY TELLS THE TRUTH, THE SAXOPHONE & NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH FRIENDS high on my list), this nevertheless should please the multitude of fans who cherish I LOVE LUCY. The public voted VITAMEATAVEGAMIN (i.e. officially entitled LUCY DOES A TV COMMERCIAL) as their very favourite. Although it wasn't Lucille Ball's favourite episode - per se - that was with Dean Martin in THE LUCY SHOW, surprisingly enough - Lucy later admitted she thought that the Vitameatavegamin routine was the best thing she ever did. The contents of the bottle was apple pectin (!). The biggest laugh EVER recorded on the show was during the scene when Lucy smashed 2 dozen eggs while dancing the Tango with Ricky. The audience laughed for a straight 65 seconds. Obviously, about 3/4 had to be edited out. JOB SWITCHING, I would think, would be considered the second most loved of all episodes, it was certainly the one I most associated with the show as being THE classic episode. The Grape Vat, i.e. LUCY'S ITALIAN MOVIE, would probably come in third. It's fairly common knowledge that more people watched the birth of Little Ricky than watched Eisenhower being ""sworn in"" as President in 1953. The mirror sequence in the Harpo Marx episode is brilliant and who can forget Ms Ricardo wreaking havoc in the Brown Derby when her ""dreamy"" movie star idol - Bill Holden - is sitting in the neighbouring booth? THE BALLET contained a lot of ad-libbing in that Lucy actually got her leg stuck around the barre in real life: if you look closely, you can see bruises on her legs! When the gang passes thru Albuquerque, Ethel's ego goes to the ozone layer. Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to swallow that the actor playing Ethel's dad (Irving Bacon) is obviously younger than Freddie Mertz, but who really cares?). Lucy is beautiful as she upstages Ethel Mae on stage. I have a small gripe about some of the footage being cut out of many of the episodes: it isn't much, but REAL Lucy afficionados will notice them. It would be wonderful if the ""video people"" would show every episode COMPLETELY un-cut, in their original length. From what I hear, the new DVD collections are beautifully clear and pristine prints from the first season.....AND, they are shown in their entirety.",1038528000,,2462,4.850356294536817
1633564,5,B00005NFY3,"""The Best of I Love Lucy"" collection is one of the best sets with ""I Love Lucy"" episodes ever made.  This set includes the ten most popular episodes voted by people worldwide.  These two videos are avaible in seperate volumes.  The first tape is volume one.  It features the first five most popular.  The first and most popular show is ""Lucy Does a T.V Commercial"" (Episode 30)  Ricky is going to do a variety show and Lucy wants to be the one that does a commercial.  She gets to do a commercial for ""Vitameatavengiman.""  It is hilariously funny when she gets drunk while drinking too much.  The second episode, ""Lucy's Italian Movie,"" (Episode 150) Lucy goes to Italy during a trip in Europe.  She is made an offer to be in a movie and accepts it.  The funniest part is when she is in the wine vat.  It is hilarious.  Third is ""Lucy Does the Tango."" (Episode 172)  Lucy practices with Ricky the Tango.  They go into the egg industry and when the chickens aren't laying eggs, Ricky says that they have to get rid of them.  Lucy Tangoes with eggs in her blouse in an attempt to save the chickens.  In ""The Freezer,"" (Episode 29) Lucy buys a freezer to store meat.  She orders 32 pounds of meat and ends up with hundreds.  When Ricky shows up with 32 lbs of meat, she gets locked in the freezer!  In the final episode, ""Harpo Marx,"" (Episode 124) Lucy's friend Carolyn Applebee shows up in Hollywood expecting to see a lot of movie stars.  Lucy imitates them and the real Harpo comes in the end.  In the second video, the shows are the following:

L.A At Last!  (Episode 114)
Lucy is Enceinte  (Episode 50)

1633565,5,B00005NFY3,"It doesn't get much better than ""I Love Lucy."" The episdoes on this edition are just great. The sweetest episode, ""Lucy goes tot he hospital"" is on the second video and still after 50 years brings a smile to my face. This video is a must have for Lucy fans. The extra video, Babalou Music is WONDERDUL! Contains some of my very favorite clips of music from ""I Love Lucy."" The sweetest one is when Ricky sings ""Cheek to Cheek"" to Lucy. It almost makes me cry everytime!!! This video is well worth it!!!",1033344000,3,501,4.340425531914893
1633566,5,B00005NFY3,"These nine episodes are the best Lucy episodes. Out of a ten scale, here are the separate reviews:
Vitameatavegamin- 8/10- Very funny about Lucy doing a tv commercial and getting drunk over it.
Italian wine vat- 6/10- Not one of my favorites, but funny. About Lucy starring in a movie scene about the making of wine by crushing grapes in a vat.
Crushing the eggs- 9/10- Hilarious. About Lucy and Ethel sneaking eggs out to the henhouse in Lucy's new home to help the chickens cooperate in laying eggs to sell. When whoops! she dances with Ricky.
The Freezer- 10/10- I love it. It's about Lucy and Ethel accidently buying 500 pound of meat for their new freezer in which they bought in a bargain. Ethel stalls for time while Lucy throws the meat in the furnace and gets locked in the furnace.
Harpo Marx- 10/10- In Hollywood, Lucy and Harpo meet face to face in a very funny mirror scene when Lucy wants some celebrities to help entertain her friend Caroline, who can't see a thing without her glasses.
The Chocolate Factory- 9/10- When in the chocolate factory, Lucy and Ethel mess up the place when trading places with Fred and Ricky in the jobs and housework. Fred and Ricky don't have much luck, either.
William Holden- 9/10- Another classic, Lucy meets with William Holden and really gets embarrassed in the restaurant. They she meets up with him again in her own hotel room.
The Burlesque Comedy- 7/10- Lucy, again, wants to get into the act. So she hires a burlesque comic to help her on her Slowly I Turned skit.
Ethel May Potter- 5/10- Not too fun, Ethel and the rest stop by Ethel's hometown, Albuquerque, on their way to Hollywood and it seems like all the people care about is their own Ethel May Potter.
Overall, a very funny video with popular classics. Don't pass this by!",1029715200,8,1786,4.584375
1633567,4,B00005NFY3,"I taped a lot of the ""I Love Lucy"" episodes but i wanted them without the commercials so i bought this collection. The only bad thing about this, is that all the episodes are edited, even more so than they are on TV. I really don't know why because they had enough room to fit all the episodes on the 2 tapes(I will never understand those darn editors). Your better off just tapeing the episodes and stop recording when commercials come on. If they didn't edit the episodes as much as they did, i would have given this item 5 stars.
 As for the bonus video ""Finding Lucy"", it was great. It mostly focused on ""I Love Lucy"" and than a little bit on Lucy's life after ""I Love Lucy"". It shows a lot of footage that i have never seen before, includeing Interviews with Lucille Ball and home videos! Its a great video to add to any Lucille Ball or ""I Love Lucy"" fan's collection!",1009843200,13,873,4.259036144578313

7946965,5,B00005NFY3,"More than half a century after it first premiered, ""I Love Lucy"" is still as humorous as the day they first aired. Each of the ten episodes included in the collection were voted the ten best of the series through an online poll and each showcases the comedic and musical talents of each of the primary cast members (Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and Willaim Frawly). Lucy, however, is undoubtedly the star of the collection.  Her classic comedy shines through in each episode, whether she is getting intoxicated from too much Vitametavegamin or wrapping candy from a speedy convayer belt. The set also includes many more memorable Lucy moments including their visit to Hollywood (""Harpo Marx"" and ""LA at Last""), their European Tour (the infamous grape-stomping episode), and Lucy's eternal quest to be in Ricky's shows (""The Ballet"" and ""Lucy does at TV Commercial"").
