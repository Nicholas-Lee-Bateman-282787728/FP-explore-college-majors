3431952,5,B0019BI11O,i started watching this show from the first episode and it is one of the funniest things you can find on tv today specially if your a gamer. the references and jokes towards games/people of the past and present are hilarious. ill definitely be buying this set when its released. if your a gamer or fan of animation do yourself a favor and pick this one up!. also don't forget to catch season 2 currently airing new episodes on G4TV sunday nights at 10pm.,1211846400,10,454,4.416666666666667
3431953,4,B0019BI11O,"Originally airing on the G4 network, Code Monkeys is from the same minds behind Adult Swim's Minoriteam, which will either tell you right now if this is up your alley or not.  Code Monkeys revolves around a crew of video game developers in the 80's, and the crazy hijinks that ensue when they get a new boss in the form of the gun-toting, money hungry Texan Larrity.  The main characters the show revolves around are sissy-boy Jerry and the wisecracking Dave; who are among a crew that also features a role-playing nerd and the lone black employee.  What follows involves the crew tangling with Hitler's descendants, taking a trip to prison, and getting the chance to make a game based on Steven Spielberg's E.T. (one of the absolute best episodes of the whole series).  While Code Monkeys is often inspired lunacy with some great visual gags, there are a number of moments where no one will be laughing.  However, the good very much outweighs the bad with Code Monkeys, and the show as a whole is very enjoyable, with enough old-school video game references to make any gamer smile.  If you've never watched Code Monkeys before but dig much of the Adult Swim comedy programming, chances are you'll dig this as well.",1211328000,20,1216,4.712264150943396
3431964,3,B0019BI11O,"The show itself is hilarious and worthy of a five star rating, and I really wish they had made Season 2 available on DVD/Bluray as well. I'm not all that knowledgeable on video editing, encoding and so on, so I'm probably going to misuse a few terms here, but there is one big issue here.

I honestly can't remember if this was present when the series was airing on TV, but about half the episodes on the DVD have some serious encoding/aritfacting issues that make them REALLY hard on the eyes at times. At first, I thought I had made a mistake while ripping the episodes off the disc or while re-encoding them, but when I went back and watched the episodes straight off the disc the problem was still present (even using different devices to play the disc). I honestly can't explain the issue in words, but it's enough to give me a headache while watching the episodes afflicted by it.",1496880000,6,886,4.469135802469136

(Beware of Seller changes! That's how you can get burned!)

:: PROS ::
1.)  Offensive, irreverent & outlandish, like a true video game cartoon should be!
2.)  Takes Old-School gamers down memory lane.
3.)  Early Dana in his prime, just hilarious for fans of games, ATHF, G4 TV and 8-Bit games.
4.)  Episodes have surprising guests, you won't believe who does cameos in this show!
5.)  TRUE GAMING FANS CARTOON - Normal people will hate this ;)

:: CONS ::  (Not really any cons, but let me list some things anyway...)
1.)  WHERE IS SEASON 2!?!??!?
2.) NETFLIX REMOVES SHOWS I LIKE ALL THE TIME AND I CANCELLED THEM BECAUSE OF IT!!!

:: OVERALL :: Funny, good production values despite it's age & 8-bit influence.  This show is a must have for fans of DANA and shows like Aqua Teens, Sea Lab 2021 or other similar cartoons.  I wish season 2 was out - ""Cock Goblin""  Episode is classic!!!",1479859200,3,949,4.511764705882353

This show takes some getting used to, but after you get into the first couple of episodes you'll basically be watching the funniest 8 bit video game tv show you've ever seen.

So many references to old school video games!
Any gamer/nerd will love this show, or at least they should!

There's a lot of potty humor here, but all in all it's funny to see the boundaries that were pushed, and the things they were able to get away with in the cartoon realm.

Every episode plays (figuratively) close to an actual 8 bit game from the ""boing"" effect of a jump to losing a heart of life to crashing into a wall.

3432038,1,B0019BI11O,"Code Monkeys is a rash, unpleasant wart of a show which trudges through its half-assed narrative with forced set-ups to unfunny jokes. The cast is each defined by the TOTALLY CRAZY one-liners he or she spews in response to the TOTALLY CRAZY one-liner that preceded it, and as the show stumbles through the finish line of its pilot episode, I have to ask myself why Amazon thought it appropriate to recommend this cartoon - which is clearly aimed at early to mid teens - to me.

It's likely because I am a gamer, and Amazon knows it, but surely there is better programming targeted towards my ilk. Ah, scratch that: there doesn't need to be. Do football junkies need football sitcoms? Do gardeners need comics about gardening? Why should I watch a show about video games when I can just as easily play them?

Please, give me Arrested Development or 30 Rock. Give me South Park or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Show/dp/B000CQQID0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Show</a>. Not all gamers go hysterical at the sight of a man humping a computer, or split sides at every forced Star Wars reference this show can muster (why is there a dead donkey in the room? because look out - ton-ton reference! LOLLLL!!1). Surely I am not the only gamer who reads the newspaper, or a book from time to time? Surely there are others who actually go to comedy clubs and have a sense of humor more advanced than that of a turd-in-a-microwave gag?

If Code Monkeys develops into anything worthwhile after its pilot, I'll never know - and I can live with that. It's sad to see G4 picking up such lazy programming, but I suppose they've got to run out of COPS reruns sometime, right? Meanwhile, I'll lament this juvenile caricature of my kind.",1281398400,4,1765,4.916107382550336

3432040,5,B0019BI11O,"this show is so brilliant i am shocked to my core it made it to television. and on G4 no less, the network that apparently is trapped in a contest with mtv to see who can produve the worst television possible the fastest.

a show done in classic 8-bit animation style with constant references to the best and worst video games of our youth. it speaks to the heart of true blue gamers with a sort of ""office space"" i hate my job quality mixed in. it follows the adventures of the two lead programmers at a ""fake"" company called gameavision and the rest of the staff who are various levels of crazy and entertaining. the video game related cameos are actually pretty entertaining, some great developers lend their voices to the show from time to time. Codemonkeys is a difficult show to describe, all you need to know is if you like video games, this rocks.

i highly recomend buying the dvd here to avoid the painful experience of putting up with G4 comercials just to watch this awsome show. buy several copies of the dvds infact so they put more seasons out on dvd. there is nothing bad i can honestly say about this show. it's worth your time trust me.",1269216000,4,1154,4.413145539906103

Obviously, a great deal of work was put into creating the style of the show.  The entire look mimicks 80's video games, from the blocky, pixelated characters to the sound effects to the health bar at the top of the screen.  Even the theme song, performed by geek musician Jonathan Coulton, was a nice touch.  Now the downside (and oh lord, is there ever one!)  Any witty humor or clever gags are barely visible through the thick, greasy film of brainless, playground gross-out humor.  It's as if the show was written by a group of third-graders who crack each other up by saying the word ""penis"" over and over again.  The storylines are inane and the characters are all tired stereotypes with nothing original to say or excrete.

If your video game nostalgia is strong enough to tolerate characters peeing their pants as a running gag, then I recommend Code Monkeys.  Otherwise, you might try The Super Mario Brothers Super Show.  It's not good either, but at least it won't make you nauseous.",1259020800,5,1260,4.660633484162896

3432069,5,B0019BI11O,"Code Monkeys, a show animated in 8-bit video game style (complete with health bar and points at the top) takes place in the early 80's during the video game boom and is about a fictional video game company called Gameavision. The main characters are Dave, a slacker pothead who's always causing trouble, but is probably one of the best programmers there, and his best friend and fellow programmer Jerry, a clean-cut, responsible anxiety-filled guy who usually ends up having to clean up Dave's mess. Several other hilarious characters in the show include Larrity, a Texas billionaire who runs Gameavision (poorly); Dean, Mr. Larrity's dimwitted son; Mary, the company's only female programmer; and Todd, a programmer who loves fantasy/role-playing games and nachos a little too much.

Whether you're a hardcore gamer or just a casual fan with a good sense of humor, you have to check out Code Monkeys! The animation is very simple and brilliant at the same time. The writing is suprisingly well done, and it's one of the most original shows I've seen in a long time! I highly recommend Come Monkeys Season 1.

3432072,5,B0019BI11O,"With the market being saturated with worthless reality television shows, and garden variety sitcoms that go nowhere, Code Monkeys is a refreshing and wonderful comedy for adults. The show has a very unique presentation in that it is animated in the style of an 8-bit video game, the characters themselves being edited River City Ransom sprites. The story is about a fictional video game company during the Atari age of video games, though the show makes many referrences to current video games and technology.  The show is somewhat reminscent of a sprite comic that teenagers typically make on the internet, but the difference is this show is ACTUALLY funny AND creative.

Unfortunately, the DVD quality is iffy.  As another reviewer mentioned, there's strange artifacting in many of the episodes that is so distracting as to be unwatchable. It's probably something due to resizing an interlaced source as it's a sort of moire effect of alternating jaggies every frame. I tried every form of decomb, deinterlace, and noise filter on the videos, but still the artifacts were too unbearable.  Really a travesty that a show I love so much got such a crippled DVD release and no season 2 DVD release at all.

FYI, the episodes that look fine are 1, 4, 8, 11, and 13.  So that's 5 of 13 episodes that are watchable.  You can decide whether or not it's worth buying for only 38% of the episodes, a few promos, and a couple behind the scenes videos (that are also poorly encoded).",1525564800,,942,4.610778443113772
