This show consists of a bunch of females who enjoy playing half naked ""bad girls"" on roller skates.  Few if any have real roller skating skills so calling this a sport is ridiculous.  Of the two leagues, one is immediately eliminated.  Roller Derby is skated on a banked track to allow fast skating, passing and blocking at speed.  The flat track ladies put on a show of scantily clad females, wearing hot pants and tank tops, knocking each other over with few to no skating skills.  Roller Derby skaters were champion professional roller skaters who wore heavily padded uniforms including tights to their ankles with padding over body parts most likely to hit the ground at speed.  These girls need no protection as they can't skate fast enough.  Dangerous?  Typical skating rink injuries occur because these girls don't know how to roller skate.

A least the second league uses a banked track.  Some skill is required to skate on a banked track.  Doing so properly is another thing but at least these girls have the correct basic equipment.  Banked track aside, we again have the hot pants and tank tops which offer no protection if a real Roller Derby game was skated.  If these girls were women with real skating skills, the silly ""fierce"" names and sexist outfits would not be required.  Those who speak of ""self esteem"" are self-delusional.  They don't even use their own names!  Self-esteem comes from accomplishments due to skills.  None of the women shown could have made it to the real Roller Derby training school let alone as a professional Roller Derby skater.  None of these participants are athletes based on their skating ability, so how is this a sport?  The real Roller Derby sport ended 4 decades ago.  The ""Roller Derby"" shown in this video is a ""sport"" like mud wrestling is a ""sport"".  Any main attraction consisting of women in hot pants and tank tops is a sexist show, not a sport.",1445731200,,1993,4.757309941520468

I have actually skated with both ACDG and LBRD and the way you highlighted each girl's passion and strength is as we say...""Amazeballs"".

I started out with ACDG (Angel City Derby Girls Flat track League in Los Angeles, CA) and after a year I moved to Long Beach.  So inevitably the commute took it's toll on me, so I transferred to LBRD (Long Beach CA Bank Track League).

It was so great to see all my sisters at ACDG whom I learned to skate with: Hitney Fears, Reno Revolver, Tiggz and Chica-Go-Lightening, Ghetto & Go-Go all were some of the best coaches. Their passion for the game is so inspirational.

Now I skate with Diesel and the Terminal Island Tootsies and skating the Bank Track at the Long Beach Roller Dome has been one of the single most amazing experiences of my life.

Skating with Diesel, her sister Bio-Diesel and Estro Jen I have grown by leaps and bounds as a skater and as woman.

In Long Beach skating is a culture, it's a neighborhood affair and the sense of unity it brings to the community never ceases to amaze me. I truly love being a part of this revival of the Roller Gurl!!!

These women became my family when I had no one and nothing to do. Roller Derby gave me a purpose and a passion to do something different.  By different I mean something ""good for myself"" and ""totally bitchin' "" at the same time!!  I've never felt better about who I am and what I'm doing as I do when I hear the sound my wheels make on that birch wood!!!

That GV13 trailer clip with Pigeon is also unbelievable... all I remember as I slid on the floor was thinking, ""Oh my god this is such an amazing hit I really hope someone is getting this on film!!!""  And wouldn't you know it... I got one of the most amazing compliments from the gal that laid the hit in your beautifully portrayed documentary.

Plus, once you get hit that hard, the only thing you have eyes for, is getting back on the track and getting even with your gal... in this case Pige!! hahaha!!!

I'm so proud to have been a part of your film and this amazing movement that empowers women and girls to believe that they can be as strong, as sweet, as brutal and as beautiful as all derby girls are, inside and out!!

Besos and Best Wishes
