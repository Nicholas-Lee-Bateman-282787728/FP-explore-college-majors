7539605,5,B0185P7LO4,"Went to see this film last night on Christmas Eve!!! I don't know what to say or how to describe my feeling!!! Two hours were never enough for such a beautiful story! It's so beautiful! I don't want to post spoiler here but when this DVD come out I would definitely order it!!!! And because of this movie I am falling in love with Rooney! I watched her movies in earlier years but this one really makes her outstanding! There were too many silent scenes that I doubt if there was not Rooney no one else could really play this role! Her humbleness and silence make her confident in this role as Therese, Cate on doubt played excellent as usual without emphasizing on her professional skills! But more to say is Rooney Mara!! This movie could win her Oscars! Seriously, cauz no other movies in the world offers so much silent but breath taking atmosphere with both a mature and a young emerging movie stars. I love it!!! LOVE IT!!!!!LOVE IT!!!!!LOVE IT!!!!!LOVE IT!!!!! I really hope I did not give 5 stars to all the other movies so easily that I really want to give more stars for CAROL!!!!!!! wait... can I put the stars here?

Or as one top critic wrote: ""[Carol is] so rich; its a little like drowning in double cream...this is quiet, significant cinema from a master filmmaker operating at the peak of his powers."" Cate Blanchett's finest performance (yes, even above Jasmine and Hepburn) and Rooney Mara perhaps even more impressive.",1450483200,20,374,5.660714285714286
7539609,5,B0185P7LO4,"Directed by Todd Haynes (Velvet Goldmine, Far From Heaven) from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy (Mrs. Harris) based on the novel The Price of Salt by Patrician Highsmith, Carol is a film that is hard to categorize because it works on a number of levels, as a character study of two very different people who transform each other, as a period piece (1952 New York City), and as a romance from a time when gay people had to use an unspoken language of looks and gestures to convey things under the public radar and even that of friends and family.

It's the Christmas shopping season in New York City in 1952.  An aspiring young photographer, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) is working as seasonal help in the toy department of an upscale department store in Manhattan when a customer, an older and obviously well-to-do woman name Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) asks for her help in selecting a Christmas gift for her daughter.  There is an immediate chemistry between the two, felt by both but limited to moments in glances.  After purchasing a toy train set on Therese's recommendation, Carol seemingly forgets her gloves, leaving them on the counter, which Therese finds and ends up mailing to Carol's home in New Jersey. Each has thoughts later, unspoken but clearly working beneath the surface in the expressions on their faces when they're alone.

As the film progresses, we learn that Carol is going through a nasty divorce from her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) with the predictably bitter fighting over custody of their daughter Rindy (Sadie & Kk Heim).  Upon receiving her gloves from Therese, and in need of someone simply to talk to, Carol invites Therese to lunch. Again we see the chemistry at work between the two, obviously felt but unspoken, cautiously danced around but never approached, because that's the way things were back then, when acknowledgement could cost Carol custody of her daughter and Therese any chance at having a career. Not to mention her relationship with her boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacey) who rapidly becomes jealous of the increasing amount of time Therese wants to spend with Carol.

The performances are excellent all around, but Blanchett's and Mara's nonetheless stand out, to the point that both have already garnered a number of award nominations and seem certain to pick up Academy Award nominations as well.  They each have different tasks as their characters are in truth so very different, coming at this relationship from not only different ages and levels of understanding and experience but also from different social and economic standings as well as aspirations in life. There is a well-played out delicacy and tentativeness in their early encounters, so much having to be conveyed almost intuitively because so much depends on the actresses bringing out their characters feelings without the benefit of simple dialogue, and Blanchett and Mara handle this beautifully.

Also worth mentioning are Edward Lachman (Far From Heaven, I'm Not There)'s lush and textured cinematography and the atmospheric musical score by Carter Burwell (True Grit, Fargo) that add a layer of feeling and emotion to the interactions taking place on the screen.

Note:  an interesting film for comparison is High Art (1998) which also involves a relationship between two women, one of them a photographer, also set in New York City but over four decades later when social attitudes were decidedly different but relationships were still just as tricky to maneuver.

Highly, highly recommended for its stellar performances and for capturing what life was like for these two women - and countless others like them - in that place and time.",1450310400,128,3658,5.038079470198675
7539610,5,B0185P7LO4,"Cue the song ............
""Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her, again and again."" **

In CAROL, the some enchanted 'moment' glows for two women drawn to each other in an unexpected and unstoppable romance. A visually striking atmospheric drama with exquisite cinematography, meticulous elegant production design, iconic fashion, and an evocative, haunting score that communicates the inner landscape between the sophisticated and enigmatic Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) and the bashful but unhesitating Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a younger woman searching for her place in the world who becomes self-aware of her true nature. Blanchett and Mara deliver compelling performances as two women gradually moving towards each other in an electric force of instinctual attraction and yearning. How they unveil the complex human drama of Carol and Therese is outstanding. So much is said without verbiage: a touch, a subtle gesture, a gaze, a lingering smile  reveal a quiet storm of emotions. When they finally surrender to their mutual desire the lovemaking is intensely intimate, sensual, and memorable.  The emotional power of the final scene is staggering.  Carol and Therese find themselves in each other, but forbidden love ultimately comes with a cost and both must face choices that will forever transform their lives.

This film is not a formulaic romance movie.  This is a love story about longing set in an era where there was no language to describe what Carol and Therese meant to each other.  Even the use of the word ""lesbian"" did not exist in the vernacular of the times.  The dialog between these two lovers is not obvious  it is internal and nuanced.  To understand their story we are persuaded to consider the personal journey of each woman, and contemplate their courage and hopes.  Throughout the film subtle metaphors convey undercurrents (e.g. the continual repetition of a moving train seen or heard; the three-sided vanity mirror in her daughter's room where Carol's divided reflection is missing from the center, but in the mirror at the Waterloo motel, with Therese, she is fully visible).  This adaptation of ""The Price of Salt"" by screenwriter Phyllis Nagy is remarkable.  Unlike the original story, which is rendered entirely from Therese's point of view and wherein we see and hear Carol through her perception, Nagy molded Carol into a three-dimensional character.  In the film version we experience the essence and completeness of both women.  It took 18 years for this lesbian story about falling in love, and the universality of being in love, to advance from script to screen and the result is an extraordinary work of cinematic art that stays with you, and will lure you to watch again.

CAROL was shot on Super 16mm film using 35mm lenses to create a grainy image that would be reminiscent of late 40s/early 50s street photography, particularly photographs shot with Ektachrome. Cinematographer Ed Lachman won the prestigious Golden Frog award at Camerimage (The International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography).  Cinephiles will recognize the scene that bookends the story of Carol and Therese  their meeting at the Ritz Tower Hotel  as an homage to ""Brief Encounter"", the classic 1945 romance film.

CAROL is based on ""The Price of Salt"" (retitled ""Carol"" in 1990 by author), the unprecedented 1952 lesbian romance and semiautobiographical novel by Patricia Highsmith published under the pen name Claire Morgan, in the midst of the McCarthy era, during a time when homosexuals were not expected to have happy endings and homosexuality was regarded as a mental disease; and many lesbians were institutionalized and subjected to psychiatric treatments that promised a ""cure"" for homosexuality.  In the scene at Harge's parents house the 1953 inaugural address by President Eisenhower is playing on the television set: it is noteworthy that in April of the same year Eisenhower issued ""Executive Order 10450"" regarding security risks posed by federal employees. The order, which also regulated federal contractors, included ""sexual perversion"" as disgraceful conduct and was used to ban homosexual men and women from the ranks of the federal government. The prohibition fed the ""Lavender Scare"" persecution of the 1950s. (The directive was revoked 42 years later, in 1995, by President Clinton.)

Among Patricia Highsmith's many works are novels ""Strangers on a Train"" (produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951) and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (adapted as 1960 French film ""Plein Soleil"" and under original name in 1999 by director Anthony Minghella).

Carol is yet another masterpiece of LGBTQ cinema along the lines of Blue Is the Warmest Color, Moonlight, Call Me by Your Name, A Single Man, or Love, Simon. Carol is as heartfelt and emotional as any great romance drama.

Todd Haynes directs Carol with a touching sincerity. He captures the heart of the romance and the fear of the forbidden love. The numerous close up shots of faces and hands are lovely. They really convey the hidden love these characters feel. The cinematography is equally beautiful as every panning shot holds your attention.

The leading actresses Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are sublime. You believe their pain, you see their uncertainty, you feel their passion, and you root for their love. Blanchett portrays a divorcing mother with a strong will and such empathy. Mara is so sweet and innocent that you want her to be happy. Carol contains two exemplary performances by two of the finest actresses in Hollywood.

7539621,5,B0185P7LO4,"Todd Haynes 2015 lesbian love story Carol is an intoxicating romantic drama of the most sensuous beauty. Rarely on screen have emotions been visualized with such tangible sensitivity as they are in this story set in the winter of 1951-52 about two women at crisis points whose lives intersect to explosive effect. Therese (Rooney Mara) is a young 20-ish independent woman living in New York on the cusp of making big life changing decisions. Working as a department store salesclerk she has to decide whether to go to France and marry her boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) or to respond to the gradual dawning in her awareness of the true nature of her sexuality. It is also a choice between career-less marriage (such was the social expectation in the 50s) and a possible career as a photographer. Her adult life is just starting and she is at that uncertain inexperienced stage where everything and everyone seems to be pressing on her to decide her future. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is a 35-ish mother of a daughter going through a divorce from her wealthy husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) brought on by a lesbian affair 5 years earlier with her friend from childhood Abby (Sarah Paulson). Having at Thereses age wrongly chosen a life of heterosexuality she now desires the freedom to start over and stop living against her grain.

The film is flawlessly acted by everyone, especially by the two lead ladies who both manage to express so much through saying so little. This is a film where the tiniest gestures count to really pierce to the heart of these two tortured souls, one who feels all fenced in and pressured and the other who suffers (and has to hide) severe psychological stress brought on by having to live a lie. Phyllis Nagys wonderful adaptation (of Patricia Highsmiths autobiographical novel The Price of Salt) is a subtle and highly refined evocation of an era when people talked and acted very differently from the way they do now, while Ed Lachmans camera conjures up a theater of the senses with chiaroscuro sequences full of delicate shadows, soft-focus haze and reflective visual poetry. As Therese is swept away by the glamorous Carol in her car Lachman makes the smell of the older womans perfume visible as Therese is captured through windows and in reflections which articulate an eruption in her soul. Haynes is a master of melodrama as his other 50s tale Far From Heaven demonstrates, but where that film was written by him and is intensely cinematic at base, in effect a complex postmodern intertextual pastiche of various texts and various other films (mainly by Douglas Sirk), Carol came to him much later after several other directors had passed it up. It is less personal, less cinematic and obviously much more literary at base. As Carter Burwells wonderfully subtle score (none of Elmer Bernsteins sweeping string sonorities) points up, it is not a Sirkian melodrama as some people have claimed, indeed not one Sirk film is cited and there is precious little melo about it. This is literary drama straight and pure which works wondrously well from the opening shot of the grilled subway ventilation shaft cover through to the superb restaurant finale. It sits alongside Wong Kar-wais In the Mood for Love as one the most accomplished love stories the 21st century has yet given us and I was angry that despite all the critical acclaim, the film was snubbed at the Oscars in 2016. The fact that they overlooked even nominating Carol for both Best Picture and Best Director says a lot about their suspect artistic judgment (no way are either Spotlight or The Revenant even remotely in the same league) and underlines the sad prejudice against films with a gay theme which continues to prevail in conservative America. What happened to Carol happened to Brokeback Mountain a decade earlier. I say this as a heterosexual. I have no agenda to pursue and simply think artistic accomplishment should be correctly acknowledged and am irked when it isnt. The rest of this review will be thematic and will contain spoilers. If you haven't seen don't read.

As with all great films, Carol possesses a highly accomplished screenplay based on a sound narrative structure which warrants close examination. Phyllis Nagy was a friend of Patricia Highsmith and The Price of Salt was the novel she chose after the celebrated author suggested she select one for adaptation. The first script was written in 1997 and it went through several re-writes, the last with Nagy and Haynes working together. Those familiar with Far From Heaven will assume the direct movie references in Carol come from Haynes, but this is only partially true. When I first saw the film I linked the flashback frame to Sirks Written on the Wind, but actually the reference point is David Leans Brief Encounter, a film Haynes has said was playing on his mind greatly. The Highsmith source is written in the third person and told completely from Thereses point of view. Nagy and Haynes keep this as shown in the idealized aloof glamor with which Carol is depicted, first seen in mink and then wearing a series of stunning outfits throughout expertly designed by Sandy Powell. The reference point is Grace Kelly as seen in Hitchcocks Rear Window, but that was Nagys original perception. As is the clip from Billy Wilders Sunset Blvd. which is included simply because it is her favorite film. Nagy actually writes herself into the script as the character Dannie (John Magaro), the New York Times writer who connects Therese to a job with the paper. During the Sunset Blvd. clip Dannie says, At the moment Im correlating the difference between what [the characters] are saying and what they are thinking, which tells us how we should read Carol  that meaning lies beyond words and that Nagy/Haynes are wholly concerned with communicating through images which voice the emotions rather than through words which merely say them. The uselessness of language is pointed up clearly when Carol asks Therese, What are you thinking? God, do you know how many times I ask that every day? Theres also an important sequence between Dannie/Nagy and Therese where he/she voices the films basic philosophical perception that in the world people are simply balls bouncing off each other with causality beyond rationalization. People are either attracted or not attracted to each other. Dannie uses the line to woo Therese and is promptly rejected, but it connects to what Carol says to Therese twice in the film, that she is An angel. Flung out of space. We are all flung out of space, balls ready to attract or not attract as the case may be. We know not why. We just feel and react on emotion alone. Just before Carol sets off on her road trip with Therese Abby asks if she knows what shes doing. No, I never did, is Carols honest response. And that is truly the correct response for none of us really know why we make the biggest choices that shape our lives and we only know if weve made the right choices after we have made them.

For his tale Haynes deploys the classic 3-act narrative structure framed by a prologue and epilogue. In the prologue we see Carol and Therese sitting at a table in an expensive tea room. When one of Thereses friends interrupts them we sense the air is tense. Something has just happened and we are not sure if this couple are together or not. Carol places an electric hand on Thereses shoulder as she leaves to which the younger lady reacts with barely veiled erotic ardor. Words are not necessary to explain that this is a lesbian relationship in difficulty and we have to wait 2 hours before we learn if the ending is happy or sad.

Act 1 sets out the lives of these two women, the impasses which their various personal relationships have reached. Carol is finally hit by Harge with a court injunction preventing her access to her daughter. Knowing the court hearing won't be until April she resolves to leave New York and offers to take Therese for a drive across America. Therese has found the courage finally to say No to her boyfriends travel plans and decides to accept Carols offer. The affair is beautifully structured in this first act starting from a wondrous meeting in Thereses department store which is structured out of a series of framing motifs which serve to introduce the two women and state with awesome subtly their erotic connection. The sequence begins as Therese enters the store. She is given a Xmas hat which she has to wear while serving in the toys section. She studies a trainset before opening time and the way she watches (lights darkened) indicates she is thinking of her childhood. The lights go on and she has to start work, her boss ordering her to wear her hat which she obviously doesnt like. Then across the floor she spots Carol wearing a mink and looking at the same trainset. Clearly Therese is immediately attracted. She is distracted by another customer asking for the toilets. This burst into close-up interrupts he contemplation of Carols beauty. Then there is a calm shot of a pair of gloves being laid on her countertop and Therese is startled to realize the gloves belong to this same goddess-like woman. Carol asks about dolls and when she discovers what she wants is out of stock she asks an obviously nervous Therese what she played with when she was a child. The revelation that she played with trains (not dolls) obviously interests Carol. Trains are a boys toy and questions of gender are silently raised. Could this attractive assistant be gay like herself? Therese gives Carol the sales-spiel about the trainset both women had been looking at earlier and Carol immediately decides to buy it. On leaving she says with coy sarcasm, Like the hat. The final shot is of the gloves on the counter which Carol has forgotten. This repetition of recurring visual motifs (the hat, the trainset, the gloves) structure a sequence wherein the mutual attraction is gently but unmistakably delineated. We are also given the hook for the story that ensues. Therese sending the gloves to Carol leads to the beginning of their affair. The acting here is as wondrous as the storytelling, Carol all knowing and responsive, Therese all fumbling innocence and equally responsive. Their affair is developed mainly through Carols instigation and Thereses inability to say No as she finds herself completely in thrall to her lady.

Act 2 charts the road trip which clears the air. The atmosphere hovering over act 1 had been dark and oppressive and some people have criticized the film in toto for its coldness, but I think the coldness is of a piece with the subject matter. These two women are trapped by social circumstances (Eisenhower-era conservative social conformity to the very family values they are running away from) and their repressed behavior coupled with the bluey-green visual scheme of a film deliberately set in winter over Xmas which should be a time for family, is admirably matched by the coldness which in act 2 is lifted completely for a few nights until they reach Chicago and then their Waterloo in a hotel bedroom (set in Waterloo, Iowa) where their hot steamy night of passion has been found to have been recorded by a P.I. hired by Harge. Haynes makes us wait for this love scene. For the most part he stresses what is a common dynamic for many lesbian couples which is simple companionship, someone to hold on to. These two women are so stressed by their own personal problems that we sense that for Carol in particular the warmth of friendship is what she wants most of all. Only when Therese suggests they take the Presidential Suite in a motel does the idea of sharing rooms (and bodies) occur to Carol. When the love scene occurs then, its after a long beautifully structured build-up designed to happen precisely at the center of the film. Haynes shoots the bodies in a restrained way choosing soft focus and lyrical body movements rather than graphic detail. This is clearly love making as opposed to sex and the film emerges at the end as a celebration of this union  the fact that in the future they will be free to be together like this without being recorded as they are here.

Act 3 starts with Carols desertion of Therese to fight her divorce case (keeping custody of her daughter necessitates no relations with Therese) and charts again the two women living separate lives. The film feels remarkably balanced moving from cold to hot and back to cold with the narrative frame keeping us guessing as to the outcome of the story. Both women do conquer their demons in act 3 to perhaps subconsciously negotiate a way back together. In act 1 the women were miss-matched, Carol rich, mature and socially acceptable and Therese young, nave and ill at ease at not really having entered society yet. In act 3 Carol comes down from social respectability by realizing she can only be happy by living with her sexuality. She gives up custody of her daughter and gets a job. Meanwhile Therese has found the strength to see off Richard for good and is succeeding as a staff photographer on the New York Times. She finds a way into society so that when the two ladies finally meet at the point at which the film started 2 hours before they are speaking on equal terms. Therese earlier tells Carol, I never say NoI just take everything and don't know anythingI don't know what I want. How could I when all I ever do is say Yes to everything? In the tea room in the epilogue she finally states parity with Carol by saying No.

The film could have finished there, but finally it does something rather wonderful. Carol gives her the chance to think over her offer of living together and tells her she will be in the Oak Room if she decides to change her mind. We follow Therese to a party designed to lay out the 50s social way couples meet and marry. She sees both Richard and Dannie there with different women and her complete lack of connection with this heterosexual scene pushes her into at last making her decision. She will accept her sexuality and make a virtue of it. The final flight across New York and her meeting with Carol across a crowded restaurant provides one of cinemas most ecstatically euphoric love story endings. If this were heterosexual it would be strong and overpowering, as a celebration of homosexual unity it is pretty much unparalleled in mainstream cinema. Here is a gay love story set in the 50s which actually isn't about homosexuals suffering and repressing themselves. It dares to celebrate gay love on a parity with heterosexual love. Both are equal. Whatever your sexuality you cannot fail but to be lifted by this film. It will send you out roaring.",1517356800,,14641,4.763292634895628

7539631,5,B0185P7LO4,"Finally - a REALISTIC LOVE STORY - love between two women that was not written to turn men on!
This is the first fictional love story I've seen that highlights the deep emotional attachments two women feel for each other.  The movie ""Carol"" follows the book, ""The Price of Salt"", closely.  It was written by Patricia Highsmith and first published in 1952.  I suspect the story was drawn from her own life experiences.  I was pleasantly surprised by the simple unpretentious love story portrayed in this novel and movie.  Previous lesbian stories sadly lacked anything that resembles love and portrayed their main characters as empty headed lunatics, criminals, or superficial sex toys, obsessed with with each others' bodies and nothing else.  ""Carol"" is different.

It took me decades and many positive reviews of this film to give it a chance after all the previous disappointments from years ago.  I was pleasantly surprised by the realism of this movie.  Patricia Highsmith got it right, and likely drew aspects of the story from her own eccentric life experiences.  The beginning was slow for those of us accustomed to action movies but necessary for some character development if the viewer paid attention.  Subtle cues throughout the movie were easily missed by viewers who multitask or exchange text messages while watching films.

This recent 2015 movie with excellent reviews and a popular cast was only available for purchase through third party sellers.  No rental was offered by amazon.  Is this movie difficult to access because it destroys preconceived negative opinions about love between same sex couples?  These days homosexuality is supposed to be ""politically correct"".  if this is so, why couldn't I buy or rent this 2015 movie from amazon videos as I could hundreds of thousands of other titles, many of which are obscure?  Amazon.com offers a way to watch the movie through Showtime if one agrees to a ""trial subscription"".  Of my hundreds of previous DVD purchases and rentals over many years, this is the first one not available directly through amazon.com videos except through third parties.  Many of those old familiar obscene type lesbian movies made for men are still available to buy or rent directly from amazon videos, just not ""Carol"".

[I enjoyed reading the negative reviews about this movie almost as much as I enjoyed the film.  It's amazing to see how many people in the general population have no conception of genuine love between two individuals.  They make their deficit known by the content of their critical reviews of this movie.  One was better than the next.  If you understood and enjoyed this movie and have a dark sense of humor, check out those critical reviews afterwards for a few belly-laughs.]",1513036800,,2749,5.0176600441501105

It reminds everyone of what it felt like to fall in love for the first time. I hope this helps!",1512777600,,580,4.37962962962963

7539634,5,B0185P7LO4,"Beautifully filmed, understated romance between two women in the 1950s.  Rooney Mara plays Therese, a shopgirl in an upscale department store who has a chance encounter with a married woman (Cate Blanchett) embroiled in a divorce from her controlling spouse.  Their serendipitous meeting leads to a slowly developing romance, but one that is heated and simmers nonetheless.  The acting in this movie is great - Cate Blanchett's low, measured vocals evoke the glamour of Katherine Hepburn or Eva Marie-Saint in their heyday.  Rooney Mara's ingenue is both naive but guarded, slowly unraveling over the course of the film into a passionate, assertive woman. The cinematography is tasteful but fits the mood, with low lighting and muted colors evoking the bittersweet story between the two main characters.  I agree with the other reviewers mentioning the power of silence and body language in this film - a touch on the shoulder, a glance from across the room, are made to be as powerful in communicating the feelings between the two women as the more intense love scene mid-film.  I thought this was an exceptionally good film, a period piece that somehow still feels very modern.",1511654400,,1179,5.082901554404145

7539649,5,B0185P7LO4,"Every element of ""Carol"" is praiseworthy.  The writing, directing, acting, cinematography, sets, costumes, and music are exceptionally fine.

Briefly, Carol, played by Cate Blanchett is a well-to-do, fortyish unhappily married woman with a young daughter.  Carol is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce.  Therese, portrayed by Rooney Mara, is a young woman in her twenties working as a sales clerk but striving to translate her talent for photography into a career.

Carol and Therese meet while Carol is shopping for a Christmas present for her daughter.  The rapport and attraction between the two women is instantaneous.  The relationship that develops will dramatically alter their lives and the lives of those close to them.

The intimacy and directness in the way Carols story is told is compelling.  The meticulous re-creation of 1950's milieu lends authenticity to the production.  The performances by a superb ensemble of actors are totally believable.

The condemnation and stigma arising from Carol and Therese' lesbian relationship would be far less today than in the 1950's.  But unfortunately, homophobia is still present in todays society. (By the way, I am a happily married heterosexual who believes that people should NOT be persecuted for their sexual preferences.  That is an individuals choice, and its really none of our business.)",1501632000,3,1355,5.3649289099526065

Ultimately this movie is about the slow, and sometimes agonizing, process of falling in love - complicated by the fact that the two people falling in love are women in the early 1950's when gays were vilified to a much greater extent than they are now.  It's a deliciously slow, subtle, lovely little movie - something so hard to find these days among what I call the ""bang, bang, shoot 'em up, all CGI'd to hell"" movies.",1500336000,5,569,4.339622641509434

7539654,5,B0185P7LO4,"This film earned its Academy Award nominations, and might have won at least two. Cate Blanchett expressed much in expressions that lasted a fraction of a second. In scenes where the male roles were lightly written, and the men didn't amplify them, Ms. Blanchett set the tempo and carried those scenes. Her performance deserved to win, but Brie Larsen, who won, is a very talented newcomer, and Ms. Blanchett has won twice already. Yet ""Chivo"" Lubezki won the previous two years for Cinematography! And his work on ""The Revenant,"" though wonderful, was much like his earlier work on ""The New World."" Edward Lachman's work in ""Carol"" was excellent.

The writing, the soundtrack, the acting, especially the acting, left me with a heartache throughout the whole thing. That need to be who you really are, when being who you really are will hurt the people around you... I've never seen or read anything that captures the loneliness better.

Edit: I finished the book, and I've now watched the movie four or five times. I'd highly recommend the book as well. It's written from Therese's point of view, where the movie seems to show more of Carol's viewpoint. They compliment each other well.",1499385600,2,708,4.574803149606299

Being a straight male (although I wonder sometimes) I wonder why many women tolerate men, except as meal tickets. The men in this movie are portrayed as sore losers.  Carol's husband is a troll, who doesn't understand why Carol would want to be with another woman. After all, she is a mother and his wife, right? The casting is tough on men, except for Carol's attorney who seems to be a decent human being. Cate Blanchett is totally gorgeous, and perfect for this role. The initial bedroom scene was too stiff, as both women seemed awkward. (I blame the director). The period cars were beautiful.  Carol wears her fur coat all the time, although she didn't wear it to bed. She should have. The photography angle was handled poorly. First, the photos were garbage. Second, you don't hang up prints in the darkroom before fixing the prints. A final comment about female supervisors in department stores: portrayed in this movie as mean spirited and short tempered.  Even the landlady is short tempered.  A contrast between Carol, wealthy and even tempered; and the the working class, pissed off and disgruntled.",1496707200,,1179,4.845771144278607

In general, kind of slow-moving and you have to use a lot of imagination to decide why they are choosing to act the way they do. I don't mean to love each other, I mean the other plot points. There is a moment that is supposed to be a twist that changes everything, but you have to wonder why it is ultimately resolved so easily or why they let it happen in the first place. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to a movie that really let you feel the passion and the struggle of the times, a la The Hours or Far From Heaven.",1483574400,,653,4.190476190476191

The movie examined some very dramatic and painful relationships and life situations yet it didn't engage as much as it could and should have. I think it's because it lacked in logic in why and how did these two women gravitate to each other. Pleasant, interesting but just a 3 our of 5.",1482969600,,419,4.121951219512195

And, the acting is amazing!  I was captivated through the entire movie and enjoyed it the 2nd and 3rd time even more than the first! The story line moves well... not too fast to give time for the attraction/emotions to grow but fast enough keep me interested.  I wish the movie was a half hour or more longer to allow for more development!

Their beautiful performances radiate love, heartbreak, and yearning that's almost tangible. The two characters are so unalike, yet they fit together perfectly in such a way that seems so real that it's a part of the excitement and sexiness. I like to think of this film as a fine meal: the ending makes you feel full, but not too full and satisfied in a delicious and contenting way that leaves you with the grand feeling that it's something you'll order again and again in the future because it touches a deep part of you.

I've watched many, many lesbian movies, and sometimes there is a good one, but this is a gorgeous movie with two recognizable stars in that are so talented that I forgot I was watching people act; it felt more like I was peeping in on their lives.  The movie is realistic.  The sets are remarkable and so well-done, the costumes, make-up, everything suitable for the time frame.

7539835,3,B0185P7LO4,"I love Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, so I was really looking forward to watching this movie; however, I have to agree with other reviews about Rooney Mara's character being rather one dimensional, wooden, and flat. I realize she's playing someone who is young and inexperienced, but that doesn't necessarily translate into acting like a deer in headlights through most of the film. I think her character could have been more developed and interesting. I thought this was beautifully filmed, but the story line was a bit slow and didn't take advantage of Cate Blanchett's incredible range. I did enjoy the story, I just wish it had more substance and that the characters were more in depth.",1478131200,4,691,4.914529914529915
7539836,5,B0185P7LO4,"A beautifully written story about two women in love. Mara Rooney is an amazing actress! She knows how to draw an audience and bring the story to life. Cate Blanchett, is a perfect example of an eloquent and pristine woman in that era, who had to play by the rules in that of a mans world.
Both draw you in to the story and since the story is told so well, it caters to the viewer.
LOVED IT!!",1478044800,,391,4.0256410256410255
7539837,4,B0185P7LO4,"Carol is a dreamy, starkly gorgeous, slow burn of a love story between two mid-century female urbanites. Based somewhat loosely on the authors personal experiences as chronicled in The Price of Salt (for which she uses a pseudonym, Claire Morgan, aka Patricia Highsmith, author of popular novels Strangers on a Train and  The Talented Mr. Ripley), it is a moving and engrossing story of the power of attraction and love.

The brilliant Cate Blanchett plays the titular character as part predatory bored housewife and part desperate woman, trapped in a masquerading life she no longer wishes to perpetuate. At times icy and calculating, at others fragile and stoic, she commands the screen. My opinion on Rooney Maras Therese character is mixed, however. Portraying a young woman going through a powerful period of self-discovery, I was never fully immersed nor convinced. I felt she played Therese a tad woodenly, relying more on doe-eyed staring than anything else. If I had to pick a weak spot, it would be her performance.

Perhaps the most gratifying quality of the movie is that it rewards the attentive and patient viewer, traits that are sadly hard to find in most movies and attributes that might make the casual viewer, perhaps distracted by their phone or overeager for predictable fleshy romps, miss the subtle gestures, glances, and poignant silences wherein this movie truly shines. Such ADHD viewers are likely to thus stamp this movie as dull or boring, and thats simply not true. To be fair, however, I won't go so far as to say that those who disliked Carol didn't get it, as thats a knee-jerk and borderline elitist point of view. Rather, I think they need to pay better attention in the future.

While I understand why this movie has people eager to grind axes and slap subcategories on it, I don't understand why any of it matters. First and foremost, this movie was exceptional because it was well written, intelligent, gorgeous, and deeply moving. Sure, the forbidden aspect of the affair at the core adds to the heartbreak, but in the end, you could sub in any of a number of factors that would similarly render it taboo and the movie would still be as enjoyable. If Carol struck a nerve on a personal level for you, then once again art has achieved its goal. For a middle-aged hetero guy like me however, I loved it simply and totally because it was a beautiful movie.",1478044800,3,2392,4.798543689320389

7539841,5,B0185P7LO4,"I just saw this film on Showtime, and found it to be beautifully done and very touching. I write this because Cate Blanchett is one of my favorite actresses---very sensual, with a broad range, and with a soft and hard side. Rooney Mara plays the female part of the relationship--so to speak. In a traditional sense. The older, well-to-do Carol  seems to be the more dominant. That is apparent in their love scene, and in the final scene when Rooney's character Theresa accedes to Carol's desire that she move in with her. Done with just a look from across the dining room of a restaurant.

Rooney Mara, by the way, comes from NFL pro football royalty: her mother is a Rooney, owners and founders of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and her father is a Mara, owners and founders of the NY Giants. I wonder if she is a football fan.",1477872000,2,822,4.510067114093959

Rooney Mara did not disappoint by any means, but this was definitely Cate's show.  I was so captivated by Blanchett's portrayal of this woman who on one hand seems to have it all together and knows how to get exactly what she wants.  She just exudes confidence and beauty but on the other hand she is so vulnerable, lost, and powerless.  Wow!! What an amazing actress!!!

7539851,4,B0185P7LO4,"The build up of chemistry between the two is masterful, but mostly because Rooney Mara is so beautifully played as the younger, seemingly naive object of older Carol's (Blanchett) predatory attraction. We never quite get what's lurking behind Carol's calculated intentions as she slowly circles what appears to be a poor, unsuspecting Therese. Mara makes the film but Blanchett is perfectly cast as well.

Director Haynes clearly took great pains in being true to the period and it comes across with perfection. This is a similar take on his 2002 ""Far From Heaven,"" but with more focus on the parties directly involved in the forbidden relationship, rather than the loved one's left behind.",1477180800,3,690,5.106194690265487

The music is poignant and irresistible.  Todd Haynes' direction especially in his wordless scenes is extraordinary.  But the real importance is left to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.  I honestly don't know how two actors can be this good. With wonderful back up from Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler.  The other supporting players too,(I have a soft spot for the motel desk woman at the McKinley Motel ""at a very attractive rate"").
It is all perfectly cast, perfectly written by Phyllis Nagy.  Perfectly photographed and edited.  I love the murky windows, the corners, Therese's terrible clothes and Carol's beautiful ones.

A friend watched it with me, and she too is a fan of ""indie"" films. It's not like either of us likes blockbusters and were let down by lack of graphic effects. She also found it dull.  Remarkably, the day after I watched it last weekend, I was a pool party and another guest said she watched it last weekend too!  She used the same words I did about watching it:  ""At some point you've put in the investment and just have to see it through to the end, whether you want to or not.""

You can read many reviews about all aspects but the one that struck me and I have not seen mentioned is Mara's resemblance to Audrey Hepburn. If you know it or not Hepburn was and remains the most influential actress in terms of look and 'attitude' of the post war era, the ultra slim ingenue. I would be shocked if the producers and director did not consciously  intend to recreate Hepburn and so tap into the now often unconscious desire of viewers, especially influential ones, to have Hepburn back.
In most ways this is a 'little' film and certainly the now ever popular lesbian aspect has added to it's popularity among critics but I think its mostly universal acclaim by them is really due to the fact that it's like having  Audrey back.

And, although I usually like Cate Blanchett's acting, her performance in this movie seemed too consciously mannered, too self-aware, and too much like a ""performance.""

But I loved the plot, the acting, the writing, and superb directing by Todd Haynes. Two of my favorite female actors' appear in this film, Cate Blanchet who plays the title role, and Rooney Mara. Their acting is flawless. I don't think I've ever seen these two insanely talented women give a ho-hum performance. The scene where Mara's character, Therese is crying on the train is heartbreaking. You could feel her pain and disappointment through her eyes. I usually like Kyle Chandler but I found his acting rather manic and frustrating as Harge, Carol's controlling and insensitive ex-husband. This is the kind of film where you must have an open-mind since it deals with homosexuality during the 1950's. I thought the costume design and musical score were top-notch. I haven't read the novel this movie is based on, ""The Price of Salt"" so I can't say if the book is better than the movie (or vice-versa). A beautiful and deeply meaningful film. Give it a try.

Pristine Costumes - lovely color coordination - but nary a touch of required ageing of the fabric - especially on Mara's duds ...
Painfully meticulous ""Art Direction"" - perhaps too painful ... too correct .....

The mangy mink?  Makes Blanchett look like she's auditioning for ""Cats"" .....

Music?  Ersatz Philip Glass - actually - for just a brief moment we though that Mr. Glass was moonlighting ...

Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt, it is a road trip movie with a romance and its heart. Set in the early Eisenhower era 50s, it presents lovers in less forgiving times. Therese (Rooney Mara), a shop girl experiences love at first sight when she spies blonde, wealthy (and older) Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) across the room of the toy department in which she works as a holiday temp. From this scene on, their romance is a slow burn with several obstacles in its way. Visually stunning with incredibly attention to detail, the film features costumes by the incredible Sandy Powell and a soaring score by Carter Burwell.

I think the word exquisite most accurately defines this film for mea fine script, expertly directed and acted.  I re-experienced the 50s, this time from the perspective of two women who love one another.  When we meet them, Carol is older, and knows her sexual propensity, whereas Therese only knows she doesnt really care much for her boy friend, Richard, and is totally fascinated with Carol.  Both Richard and Carols husband, Harge, are flummoxed by their women.  Carol must strategize carefully to keep a relationship with her young daughter if she follows her body and heart.

7540070,5,B0185P7LO4,"From the seminal novel ""The Price of Salt"" by Author Patricia Highsmith, comes this enticing big-screen adaption from the Weinstein Company and Film 4, with a screenplay that was written by Phyllis Nagy and directed by Todd Haynes. This color, single-disc, DVD which runs approximately 118-minutes, stars an enthralling Cate Blancett in the title role of CAROL, with Actress Rooney Mara portraying her lover, Therese Belivet. Co-starring is Actor Kyle Chandler as CAROL's estranged husband and Sarah Paulson as CAROL's former lesbian lover and godmother to her only child, a darling little girl whom CAROL, adores. The backdrop of the film is set in the illustrious and regal, 1950's City of Manhattan, New York. Where a young woman in her 20's who'se been steadily dating a certain male suitor who wants to marry her, is suddenly and unexpectedly smitten and not quite so sure of her sexual preference, after having met the wealthy and sophisticated and seductively alluring, CAROL. It was an innocent 'per chance' Christmas shopping encounter where Therese worked as a sales clerk, in a Manhattan department store where CAROL was looking to purchase a gift. Not knowing a thing about each other with no mutual aquaintances and seemingly coming from two different worlds on the socio/economic spectrum, as soon as the two of them locked eyes, the unspoken mutual attraction and chemistry was undeniable. It was definitely a case of unexpected sexual attraction which neither of them, spoke of. Shyness and the social etiquette of the day, expressly prohibited the public discussion of a possible lesbian sexual encounter let alone, any physical displays of affection between same sex couples. And so, under those restrictive circumstances neither Therese nor CAROL ventured, to ask each other for a date. But, the powerful physical chemistry between them as spoken through their eyes which mirrors their very soul and it's desires..., was mesmerizing, memorable and intensely passionate. Yet, it remained a mute enigma. So, how then did they get together? Aha! For that bit of information, you'll just have to watch the movie. But, I will disclose..., that after the two women met, neither could forget the other. However, CAROL was trapped within a loveless marriage and was in the middle of divorce proceedings, when her possessive, jealous, vindicative and alcoholic husband, decided mid-stream to slap her with a ""morality clause"" regarding her sexual preference for women thus questioning the competency of her ability to be a 'good mother', with that frame of mind. And Therese, on the other hand, who had planned to go too Europe with the young man who wanted to marry her, was wrestling with feelings of entrapment, doubt and an ever-increasing desire to be with CAROL, as opposed to being sexual or going anywhere with him. So, just how did the two women who were seemingly heterosexual, respectively break away from their confines and into each others arms? And in the 1950's, no less? This provacative, seductive, intoxicating, sensuous drama is as engaging, as it is - scandalous, for it's time. This powerful motion picture deals with many social and sexual issues and subsequent questions and answers and the depiction thereof, head-on. And also, very delicately and with professional sensitivity as relating to the story content and theme, was done in good taste. As opposed too, a hard-core, pornographic display. There is, afterall..., a huge difference between ""making love"" and having ""sex."" Because 'sex' in and of itself, is not love. Prostitutes have 'sex' with the john's that solicite them, but neither 'loves' the other. In this film, the characters of Therese and CAROL ""make intoxicating love."" This movie was so well done, that it received no less than six, Academy Award nominations: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett); Best Supporting Actress (Rooney Mara); Best Cinematography; Best Costume Design; Best Original Score and Best Adaptive Screenplay. So, regardless of your sexual preference, this alluring and sensuous motion picture does not advocate pornography or a lesbian agenda. Rather, it merely illustrates the story of two women who fell head over heels in-love with each other at first glance, and had the courage to say and finally, do something about it. And how, they overcame the obstacles which otherwise would have kept them apart, rather than committed to each other as a couple. Moving drama, powerful story content and an electrifying performance by Actress Cate Blanchett. An all around intoxicating, very seductive and sensuous drama. Rated 'R' and definitely not for the kiddies. But, a definite keeper for your home DVD library collection. Nina Kish",1467244800,,4698,5.223841059602649

7540093,3,B0185P7LO4,"I remember that this film was nominated as well as Cate Blanchett.  I do think she is a remarkable actress but in this role---not so much.  I agree with many people who felt that the principal players Rooney Mara and Cate played dull characters.  To me they weren't very interesting  and all that they had in common was an attraction and passion for each other.

Cate, as Carol played an affluent lonely divorcee who led a boring life.  Therese, played by Rooney Mara is equally dull but not as well off and in a dead end job working in the doll department of a posh store.  There's instant chemistry, followed by lunch, Christmas Eve, and a road trip.  Probably of the two characters Therese has a bit more depth as she displays a talent for photography and is recognized by not just Carol, but a journalist friend of Therese's current boyfriend.  And that's another conflict within this movie.  This is where even more of the characters become flat and stereotyped.  The boyfriend is a nice but dull guy who wants to go with her on a tour of Europe and get married.  When she announces that she's going on a road trip with Carol,  he is unable to come to terms with her ""crush on this woman"" which will pass!  The other male counterpart in this film is Carol's ex, Harge who mostly shows up drunk and desperately wants her back!  So the men in this film are fairly mundane and mostly into partying----referring to the last scene where they are mostly drunk and necking with other office girls leaving Therese alone and missing Carol!

One of the redeeming qualities of this film was the historic component of being gay in the 1950s.  Lesbians and homosexuals were essentially in the closet.  Many like Carol got married and either stayed in a loveless relationship or divorced.  Young people like Therese who displayed some ambivalence about their sexuality or an attraction to people of the same sex were left out in the cold.  The filming itself was well done and the cinematography captured the 1950s very well----the clothes,  the hairstyles, make-up, cars, and music!

The 1950s for many meant a new and prosperous beginning.  WWII had ended,  servicemen came home,  went to college, got jobs, married, bought houses and had a life that wouldn't have been possible at another time.  For others that didn't quite fit into that mold, life was different and often emotionally painful!",1466553600,,2388,4.707729468599034

I did not believe their relationship or their love/lust for each other-

7540114,5,B0185P7LO4,"Intriguing period film reminiscent of the classic lesbian film, ""Desert Hearts"". Cate Blanchett played a mysterious and sexy older woman in an unhappy marriage. Her young,  soon- to -be- lover was quite fascinating to watch. Her introverted mannerisms and expressions were embodied by this actress in a way that made me truly empathetic. This movie showed us how difficult and different it was to be a lesbian in that era in the United States. Carol was quite a unique personality for her time. Unlike most women who simply conformed, she was practically an outlaw. She refused to let men (her husband, their lawyers) oppress her. But her pain was real and her reaction to having to make the decision to be herself and risk losing her child was just heartbreaking and amazing to watch!  And there was a neat ""road film"" feel. Lots of deep emotion displayed within the confines of the societal norms. I would watch it again and again!",1466035200,2,933,4.788819875776397

7540129,3,B0185P7LO4,"All the elements were right, but the real-timeyness of it all was a bit frustrating. But, at the same time, it felt like we were in watching, just a constrained as they were in living.  Even if this were a love story between a man and a woman, I would have found it equally frustrating.  I wanted a little more sizzle and felt a bt bewildered.  The film's artsiness was up there, the actors were all excellent in their roles, I'm still struggling to figure out why the overall effect on me was meh.  It felt like being there-which kind of stinks in a film.  And even though it felt like we were starting the film in an awkward moment, it was clear that Therese was presented with a choice - which road would she take?

The artiness came out in subtle ways - the hazey, gazey memories of things which had just happened.  There were a few, for me, vivid filmmaking flaws - there were some key moments in which the film's characters TOLD us what was happening instead of the director showing us what's happening.  And Rooney Mara's character did go through a progression of coming of age - learning who she is and what she is about.  Perhaps Rooney Mara was too dispassionate to really get it.  I wanted to see a little bit of class tension or learn more about Therese's background.  I wanted one of the breakups to happen sooner than it did.  Sometimes it's OK to tell when a character is delivering a monologue.  Also, there are better road trips out there, but since the goal was the relationship and not a particular destination, it sort of left me cold - just as it would have as male-female romance.  So I guess that says more about me as not liking romantic movies.",1465862400,,1669,4.376623376623376

7540178,5,B0185P7LO4,"I was extremely impressed by the subtle and classy way this film was made.  The acting was beautiful, the plot and dialogue pretty much as relevant today as they were during the time period the film was made (1950s), in spite of great strides toward not only tolerance but acceptance of gay relationships.  I feel that both main roles were superbly (and perfectly) cast. Rooney Mara in particular would have been well-deserving of an Oscar if she'd won for this film.  The story follows a young woman, Therese (Rooney Mara), as she meets an older, well-to-do woman, Carol (Cate Blanchette), through her job, and the subsequent development of their friendship and later love affair.  The situation is fraught, because Carol is in the process of divorcing her husband (a well-played but sad Kyle Chandler) and may lose custody of her daughter, their only child.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the gorgeous movie set, the clothes, the hair, etc. - all the best trappings of a cosmopolitan movie set in the 1950s.

I do not think these two had screen chemistry, but I wonder sometimes if this was not done on purpose - even slightly.  Why?  Well, consider the time period - 1950s.  If you wanted to have a lesbian relationship, you could not exactly go down to the local bar and definitely not advertise that you were gay or at least without severe retribution.  In a way, you had to take what came along.  If this offends you (the reader), it is not meant to.  If I think about it in this manner, I can easily see these two together.

Besides, how in the world could anyone not swoon over that look Cate gives Mara at the end of the film when Mara decides she is not letting Cate's character leave the relationship.

7540231,5,B0185P7LO4,"Carol is a masterpiece on so many levels. There are some illuminating interviews on You Tube with cast and crew that illustrate why the film is such an immense achievement. The collaboration with everyone involved is so unified and harmonious that as with all great works of art it simply sings. Cate Blanchett is perfect as the alluring Carol to such a degree that one wonders how anyone could not be attracted to her. Rooney Mara is beguiling as Therese. The volcanic feelings they have for each other draw the viewer into rooting for their love to succeed. The story is about what it is like to fall in love after all.
Phyllis Nagy's screenplay gives greater dimension to Carol in this tender and sensitive adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith, The Price of Salt.
Carter Burwells music describes the unspoken feelings of Carol and Therese as there attraction to one another evolves, and how they wonder if their feelings are reciprocated.
Edward Lachman's cinematography is pure poetry. The characters are filmed through windows that delicately blurr their faces adding poignancy to what they are thinking and feeling.
I could go on at great length describing the genius of Todd Haynes vision, the wonderful costume and set design, and everything that makes this film hum, but it will be more enjoyable for you the viewer to discover these things for yourself.",1463875200,2,1363,4.930434782608696

Carol was married to Harge, but divorce was eminent and custody of the daughter, Rindy, hanged in the balance. Carol was older and the more experienced lover having also had an affair with another woman, Abby, before Harge. Therese lived alone; she was single. There was Dannie who shared Therese's interest in photography, and Richard, a steady boyfriend who wanted to marry her. Richard had two former girlfriends that he had sexual relationships with, but he hadn't had sex with Therese. She doesn't want to hurt him, but she wasn't interested in him in that way. When Harge was confronted with the friendship between his wife and Therese, he was frightened, at first, then felt threatened. He gave her an ultimatum that he would take Rindy away from her. He was angry, because he didn't have the tools or sensitivity to compete against Therese for his wife's affection.

Cate Blanchett plays Carol in a minimalistic, quiet fashion; of course her elegance and beauty shine through. But Rooney Mara does not convincingly fill out her part; she is a mousey cipher and we learn almost nothing about her. She does not seem passionate about her photography, merely submissive and unsure of herself.

I was surprised that this received such extravagant praise and so many Oscar nominations - but I see now these were for political bravery rather than art. Certainly at the time the book was publshed in the early fifties, a lesbian love story was groundbreaking. Today, not so much.

The photography, shot on 16mm film, has a period feel and the 1950's clothes and autos - wonderful.",1462665600,5,794,4.746376811594203

The subtlety of the smile on Carol's face (Cate Blanchett) was perfect, but as a viewer, I really wanted that camera to give a last shot of the expression on Rooney Mara's face.

They weren't about to depict a perfect fantasy relationship between two women, because that's just not real. There wasn't a problem in their relationship, other than Carol not properly explaining to Therese why she disappeared from her. Other than that, everything was wonderful and real and you should see this movie if you actually appreciate romance between two women without secretly judging or expecting unrealistic things from it.",1462579200,2,737,5.049180327868853

7540287,5,B0185P7LO4,"While there are many things that can be eloquently expressed through language, certain things are better conveyed through actions rather than words. Love is definitely something that falls into the latter category, and CAROL exemplifies this to a tee. Why can't love just be that: love? When did we become so obsessed with labels? In a film about two women who fall in love, the word ""lesbian"" is not uttered once, and is that much better for it. Taking the emphasis on actions/visuals over words/dialogue further, there is much in the film that is conveyed through physical gestures and vague turns of phrase. While this could be interpreted as a nod to the time period in which the story is set (and when the novel was originally published), when certain topics either weren't discussed or talked about in ""code,"" I think it expresses the fundamental inadequacy of language to fully capture the range of human emotion. Also, the emphasis on visuals, completely within Todd Haynes' wheelhouse, makes the film that much more cinematic as a result. The overall style of the film is very tactile, refined, and eloquent. Another reason why the film is so good is the talent in front of the camera. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara make a believable couple, even though at first it feels like Carol (Blanchett) might be manipulating Therese (Mara) to satisfy her own selfish desires. Initially, the way in which the relationship was established combined with a Philip Glass-esque score (highly reminiscent of his work in NOTES ON A SCANDAL, also starring Cate Blanchett as a woman in a relationship with a younger person) gave the impression that this was headed to darker dramatic territory than it actually turned out to be. I wasn't quite sure I was onboard until I considered that maybe this was a way to keep the audience on their toes. Shy of that, which I eventually came around to anyway, I was fully invested in the story from beginning to end. The only legitimate negative criticism I can levy against the film is perhaps the title. Aside from being rather non-descript, ""Carol"" isn't really all that accurate, as the film is as much Rooney Mara's as it is Cate Blanchett's, perhaps more so. I also kind of like the original novel's title, ""The Price of Salt,"" which is more suggestive and comes with biblical and philosophical connotations that would probably yield some interesting analysis, or at least correlation, with the film's narrative. Simply put, CAROL is a great film. It successfully straddles two time periods, when the story was written and when the film was actually made, without feeling untrue to either. Perhaps the title character is anachronistic (theoretically, more than literally), but she definitely was ahead of her time, and yet there was no post-modern take to rationalize her existence or the way she is portrayed. She just is, and the relationship she embarks on just is. I cannot more highly recommend CAROL. Just give it a try and let the film speak (or show) for itself.",1461542400,3,3007,4.886497064579256

It is 1952 and amid the 1950s repression of that ""love that dare not speak its name"", we have two women searching to be true to themselves. From their initial encounter Carol and Terese are magnetically drawn to each other. How do they become the women they genuinely are on the inside and not bow to society's pressures and its morality laws? Once Carol and Terese meet their journey of self discovery and self awareness begins. We watch these two fall in love. Their story is indeed about the very essence of what it means to fall in love. Beautifully photographed, excellent screenplay, great set design and costuming, a beautiful musical score, wonderfully directed and of course the acting by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara is superb.

7540325,5,B0185P7LO4,"Todd Haynes understands the 50s.  As a child of the movies I loved those epic romances with the swelling music, beautiful camera work, stunning fashions, and actresses that were often the object of adolescent crushes. Who can ever forget movies like On the Terrace with Newman and Woodward, or a Liz Taylor, Monty Cliff film, or. The list goes on and on.

The problem with those films is gay men were portrayed as extremely effeminate while lesbians were portrayed as manly, frequently homely, always wearing tweed. Members of the LGBT community were never the leading characters in a film unless they were completely mentally unstable or killers. So it was an utter pleasure to watch two very feminine, beautiful women fall in love on screen.  Carol captures the essence of romantic love between two people and in this case  the two people happen to be women.

Haynes directing does credit to the Patricia Highsmith classic 1953 novel The Price of Salt, a book she wrote under a pseudo name, and in time became a best seller. The fifties culture was not kind to girls that developed crushes on other girls.  Watching The Rooney Mora character, Therese, a burgeoning photographer and store clerk  try to fit in to the world around her  is as painful to watch as is the joy of watching her connect with Cate Blanchetts Carol, the upper class soon to be ex-wife and ex-procession of Harge played by Kyle Chandler.  As in all movies of the fifties we are rooting for our two heroines to come out on top only to feel the pain of the compromise that must be made in order for them to be whole.

Carol, a breakthrough movie,  is beautifully acted, directed and produced.",1461110400,2,1664,4.683848797250859

It was not about action, mad sex, analysis in every conversation.  It was about longing and desire through glances and movement.

But these were good actors persuasively recreating a believable human drama, and if you could get past the fact that the most likable character, the Rooney character, was the most likable, even that character wasn't very likable.

And the Blanchett and Rooney characters were surprisingly opaque as far as what their real their feelings and hopes were.  Which oddly enough perhaps made the movie more realistic, but again made it more difficult to relate to the characters.

7540343,4,B0185P7LO4,"I greatly value the Amazon review forum; still, I wish more people understood the difference between reviewing and merely voicing opinions. Valuable reviews require some level of distance so that the writer can distinguish between evaluation and a matter of taste.  In my estimation, most of the negative ""reviews"" posted here reflect the latter and are rarely supported with specifics to illustrate the stated flaws.  We shouldn't attempt a review of a book or film if the style/genre/subject matter is generally not to our liking UNLESS we can check our distaste at the door. For instance, I am appalled that people pay to watch the sanctioned violence of boxing, but I can look past  my views to fairly evaluate 'Raging Bull' and see the film's merits and why it  is considered a masterpiece.

In the case of 'Carol', the difficulty in achieving the necessary distance is the opposite. The film is so much in line with my tastes that I had trouble initially putting my finger on why I consider it an excellent film but not a potential classic. Others have well described its strengths, so I'll just explain what I consider to be its shortcoming.  While the film well captures Carol and Therese's irresistible attraction; the obstacles created by differences in age, experience and class; and the awkward period of wondering if these terrifying, exciting, literally criminal feelings are being reciprocated, it doesn't build a deep connection between Carol and Therese, which the film's ending indicates has developed. Once they clearly know how the other feels, there should be some evidence in private moments of a growing trust, usually revealed in the sharing of intimate thoughts and details of their lives/pasts.  This happens in the book, which does have the luxury of building their relationship over a longer expanse of time and a point of view that gives us access to Therese's inner world.

I realize that a primary concern of film is pace and that conflicts/obstacles are its best friend. Still, if the film had lingered even five minutes longer on showing them fall deeper in love, it could have become a masterpiece. As it is, the film quickly goes from revelation of feelings to crisis, and the chance to add needed flesh to this relationship (and indirectly these characters) is lost. In comedy (or action/fantasy/thriller...) a film's success does not depend as significantly on character/relationship development. In drama, we must understand the 'why' or we will experience some degree of dissatisfaction. For me, that degree is not major; I am happy I have the film and will enjoy seeing it again and again. Still, from all the glowing reviews and hype, I had dared to hope that the film would be worthy of comparison to timeless love stories like 'Casablanca,' 'The African Queen,' 'Brief Encounter,' or 'An Affair to Remember.'  It comes oh so close, which is why I will remain a little sad that those missing five minutes weren't in the script or were left on the editing room floor.",1460678400,10,3008,4.9523809523809526

7540354,3,B0185P7LO4,"I was curious about this film because it is based on a story written by Patricia Highsmith, a genius screenwriter whose work I completely admire, especially for the time period in which she wrote. Most know her famous screenplays for Alfred Hitchcock, as suspense and mystery were her hallmarks. But she was an odd woman, not so much because she was gay--but because she had an odd personality. I had heard about THE PRICE OF SALT, which is the basis for this film, CAROL, and I wanted to see how this worked on the screen.
Firstly, I was a bit disappointed. Lovely and gorgeous as it is to look at as far as the style and feel for things circa early 1950's, it was not exactly believable. But there is an important clue in the film when Therese says she ""always says yes"", and knowing what I know of Highsmith, personally, it gave me a slight jolt. We know nothing of Therese; it's as if she's some kind of drifter, and this is a strange kind of theme with this author and here it is meant to be appealing sexually to the older woman, Carol, and this is what gave me pause.

Highsmith wrote THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY--which was never made until well after her death, but its story is odd. Odd as its author. Either the director did not get this aspect of drifter-like Therese, with no home and no background and that being the appeal for Carol, or he simply failed to fill in Therese's character--to give her more substance. This fact notwithstanding, the film didn't work for me, and it is beautiful in sensibility and style.",1460246400,3,1525,4.465949820788531

The way that Therese looks at Carol in the final scene is exactly how I felt about him.

I can tell you this whole boring story in a few sentences, to save you the time.....

It is Christmastime 1951, and Therese is working as a salesgirl in a toy store in Manhattan, and Carol walks in, looking for a doll for her four year old. Therese tells Carol that the doll that she wants is sold out, but there are many other dolls.  Carol asks Therese what she wanted when she was four, and Therese says that she wanted a train set.  Carol buys a train set, and accidentally leaves her gloves on the toy counter.  Therese goes out of her way to return the gloves to Carol.  To thank Therese for returning her gloves, Carol asks her out for lunch.  They meet for lunch in a restaurant, and Carol asks Therese what she usually does on a Sunday, and Therese says not much, and so Carol asks Therese to come to her house in New Jersey next Sunday.  So, Therese goes to this complete stranger's house and spends the day with her. The next day, Carol goes to Therese's apartment and tells her that she is leaving town, going anywhere that her car will take her, and asks if Therese wants to come, and Therese just drops everything and gets into a car with this stranger, driving endlessly and aimlessly, and they stop from city to city to stay in hotels, with the goal of going nowhere but anywhere.  More than halfway through the movie, they kiss and have sex.  (We see Therese's breasts and Carol's naked back.)  Then, Carol leaves Therese in the middle of the night, without even saying goodbye, except for a letter asking for no contact.  Carol loses custody of her child because of her ""associations"" even though she has been seeing a psychotherapist.  Two years pass (we know this because there is a calendar on the wall), and Carol and Therese have not spoken, until out of nowhere, Carol sends a letter to Therese, asking to meet for tea at a hotel.  They meet, talk for a few awkward moments, and Carol just asks Therese to come live with her. Therese says no.  Carol says, ""I love you,"" which she had never said before, and Therese says nothing. Their conversation is interrupted, and Carol takes that opportunity to leave. Therese later follows Carol to another restaurant, and they stare at each other from across the room.  THE END.

I did not see any chemistry or romance.
There was nothing to this story, except for two strangers, with nothing in common, with nothing to do and nothing to talk about, so they escape their boring lives and go on a roadtrip to nowhere.
They have sex, which was not too exciting and not worth the wait.
They break up, after being together for about one week.
I don't understand all of the good reviews, except that I think that many people just want to see two women together, and they just don't care about how good or bad the story actually is.

7540368,5,B0185P7LO4,"MILD SPOILER ALERT - This movie won't be for everyone. No movie will ever be ""Perfect"". But for those of us who have actually read the book ""The Price of Salt"", this adaptation is one of the best done in many years. It's impossible to do a complete adaptation of a book unless you plan on watching a 5-6 hour long movie. This one was close enough and hit up on all the key elements that the book emphasizes. What I love about the movie are the small intimate touches that unless you are really paying close attention will miss entirely. One reason why I say if you have only seen it once...go back and watch it again.

Little things like how when Carol and Therese look at each other, they do so with such intensity that they don't even blink. Most of the time, anyway. Or how the music fades ever so slightly during the pivotal moment of the movie when Carol finally professes her love to Therese. Or how Therese's chest begins to heave as she realizes at that same moment she loves Carol too but only just realized how deep it went. I especially love Abby's (Sarah Paulson) one brave dig at Harge (Kyle Chandler) with a word you certainly wouldn't hear a woman blurt out at a man in the early 50's (I do wish Sarah Paulson had a greater roll in the movie. She's equally an amazing actress!). The chemistry between Cate and Rooney's characters are magnetic and beautifully fluid (Unlike say Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan in ""50 Shades of Grey"". That was almost unbearable to watch!)

I saw Blue Jasmine last year and thought Cate Blanchett's performance was amazing in that movie. But there was no real ""Ending"" to Blue Jasmine. For those who have seen Blue Jasmine, as is typical Woody Allen style, leaves you scratching your head sometimes.
However, in my opinion, Cate's performance (And Rooney's) in Carol was far greater and significantly hit a more emotional cord on so many levels pertaining to those ""Forbidden"" and ""Unspoken"" expressions and actions of same-sex love more than half a century ago. For the time period, the language of such love didn't really exist. Everything had to be meticulously and cautiously played out in order to find out if the one you fell in love with feels the same way. A concept a lot of people who saw the movie didn't seem to grasp or understand.
I have seen Carol 5 times now and it just keeps getting better, for me. I have seen/watched all the nods for the Oscars in 2015. Carol, The Big Short, The Revenant, The Martian and Anomalisa were my top 5 picks but I say, find your own movie niche.",1459814400,6,2539,4.4935064935064934
7540369,2,B0185P7LO4,"I was curious to see CAROL. Anything starring Cate Blanchett has to be phenomenal. Add in Rooney Mara and CAROL packs some power. Also a film based on a  book  by acclaimed writer Patricia Highsmith surely adds dimension to the story of a lesbian love affair in the 1950's. Clearly the story of Carol is a difficult story to tell in an era that was not accepting of any alternate lifestyle.

Unfortunately, CAROL is extremely slow-moving as we meet Carol--a not very likeable or endearing wealthy woman in an unhappy marriage. She is instantly attracted to a young and innocent department store clerk named Therese (a Audrey Hepburn-esque Rooney Mara). The relationship seems highly improbable due to the difference in age between the two women and social status yet their mutual attraction takes control. Maybe there is a deep reason for Carol to seem so cold and calculating but we never learn her deeper story.

Carol's relationship with her stoic husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) is never fully explained or developed. They have a 5-year-old daughter. Carol is cold and distant with Harge in an unkind way. He seems to be  attempting to save their marriage but any attempts at affection such as a simple hug are rebuked by Carol. Harge seems to know Carol's ""secret"" or does he?  Chandler's Harge barely speaks and always seems to just have a look of sadness and confusion. It's awkward at times that Harge says so little. What is going on in his mind? Clearly there is more to the Harge and Carol story than is explained although there is a brief allusion to a problem later.

Therese is not Carol's first relationship with a female so it's not clear Carol is taking advantage  of an innocent. Therese. Carol is older and wealthy and obviously experienced at the ""game.""  Doe-eyed Therese has a  loyal boyfriend who seems confused by her in every corner. CAROL is a hard movie to watch at times. Carol is a hard woman to understand under her cold and austere veneer. She is hiding something deeper than her attraction to women but again, it is never explained.

Two great leading ladies in a film that never completely satisfies. Deeper insight into their characters is so desperately needed  to understand this story. The story is relevant today but the film could have been so much more.",1459728000,4,2291,4.772151898734177

The scene at the last attempt at an out-of-court settlement for the custody of the child was unforgettable.  The film eerily evokes the fifties, from the acting to the sets to the make-up and hairstyles, with Rooney Mara strongly recalling the young Audrey Hepburn.

7540381,4,B0185P7LO4,"This is a finely and sensitively directed movie which stays true to Patricia Highsmith's novel, ""The Price of Salt,"" with its basically happy, but not simple-mindedly happy, ending.  I was around in the 50's and It caught the movie look of the era as well as possible this side of black and white. I like movies in which the centra characters are women and their relationship with another woman is more important than their relationships with men.  In this case it's a sexual relationship, two women passionately in love with each other. In Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility,' the central relationship in the book is between two sisters.  If it were up to me, there would be more movies which treat women as full human beings with lives that don't revolve around men.  And it would be even better if Hollywood would make movies about older women, and if nobody had to be young and beautiful.  And mostly blonde.  You know, like most women look.",1459468800,5,947,4.709090909090909
7540382,5,B0185P7LO4,"I must admit, I have become hypnotized by this story. It percolates still waters I had long ago buried, reminding me that love can sometimes open us to our own true nature.

This beautifully crafted film unfolds a tale, which is at once extraordinarily personal and simply universal. Two women meet by chance in a department store, surrounded by the flurry of anxious Christmas shoppers. Each sees a spark of her own desire in the other, and both are compelled to feed their growing intermingling flames. They embark on a journey of forbidden love.

Yet, destruction ensues when lovers ignite openly, amidst formidable prejudices. The two main characters exist in a time, the 1950s, when the average woman defines herself by her status among men, and it is in this environment that the two find themselves uncontrollably drawn to one another. What pulls me into this tale again and again is the courage of the character, Carol.  She gives up all that she has known, for a possibility of a love, that although uncertain, penetrates to her core. By surrendering all, she may find some essential part of herself. She may not. A love story told through the patina of the past, it is also a timeless heroines journey.  Carol and Therese must discover and act on what they feel is right, no matter the consequences. I hope we have all felt such a love that can transform us, no matter what our external veneer, who we think ourselves to be.",1459382400,7,1434,4.701195219123506

It brought to life another era in America, but at the same time it exposed many of the societal problems husbands, wives and families dealt with then and which exist today.  The 1950's were no different, but the societal taboos, kept many social behaviors very closeted 60 years ago.  The film did a good job exposing these behaviors while  maintaining a quiet dignity and class in the film.  Good job!",1459209600,,462,4.654320987654321
7540477,5,B0185P7LO4,"Cate Blanchett rarely fails to deliver an outstanding performance. Add Rooney Mara and you've got a great film. Capturing the mood of the repressive, colorless 1950's (particularly for women, let alone lesbian women), you quickly get caught up in the mood. Smoking and drinking were the daily norm, but if you loved someone of the opposite sex, be prepared to repress it all of your life. I personally know people who did this during this era, and they led particularly sad lives. The supporting cast is equally as good.

7540492,5,B0185P7LO4,"First and foremost, Carol is a great movie. What makes it even more exciting, if you happen to be gay, is that this movie IS a great movie with a lesbian character as the lead. This isn't an LGBT movie that, when done, will only be viewed by LGBT folks. This is a movie that will be viewed and enjoyed by anyone and that also happens to be about lesbians. If you are a woman who loves women, you should watch this movie. It will leave you feeling speechless and wanting so much more. You will think about it for days after watching it and finally feel relieved that a movie was made, with well-known actors and a real budget, about people and scenarios you can relate to.

If you take even all of that away, it's a beautiful cinematic experience with so many nuances and visually pleasing scenes. I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a great drama and visually stunning cinema.",1459209600,2,888,4.414634146341464

7540524,5,B0185P7LO4,"The book, Carol by Patricia Highsmith, is Story of Love, not a love story. And the movie stays amazingly true to the premise.

7540525,5,B0185P7LO4,"For folks who discredit the stoicism of the characters, please remember this was the 1950's -- people showed much less emotion overall and did not emote in public the way we might today. Also, for a forbidden, unlawful love, there is no way Carol would have risen to greet Therese in the last scene. I think Rooney Mara's Therese shines as the stronger and more secure of the lead characters; but Cate Blanchett's Carol is the epitome of cool sophistication masking terror and insecurity. Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson give masterful and deep performances along with Kevin Crowley as Carol's lawyer Fred Haymes and Wendy Lardin as her friend Jeannette, both very brief, but solid showings.",1459036800,3,691,4.9655172413793105

7540528,5,B0185P7LO4,"Finally, a really good movie for lesbians that doesn't involve a tragic death, frustrating gay angst or a return to men. Instead, Blanchett and Mara embrace their roles and realistically portray two women who meet, fall in love and live happily ever after.

There was so much wrong with this movie. Let me just state that we are lesbians, literary, fans of arty movies, etc. I mean to say that the issue here was not that Carol was over our heads or pulled us too far out of our norm to be enjoyed. This movie just doesn't deliver. It was like watching the middle only of a movie. They line up zero motivation or explanation for these characters' actions. There is a distinct lack of chemistry between the characters. The actors seem to be giving good performances, but when you are busy not buying their actions, it doesn't make much of a difference. Surely in two hours, they could have given good treatment to a classic. Heck, if it were good, I'd even give you the third hour. I gave it two stars because it is a beautiful looking movie and the main actors do a good job, but their story has been hacked. We saw ""The Danish Girl"" in the theater this winter and decided to wait for Carol on rental. Good choice. ""The Danish Girl"" is a beautiful movie, full of great performances, that tells a full story and leaves you discussing it for days afterward, instead of saying ""well for crap's sake"" and rolling over to sleep.",1458950400,4,1305,4.330612244897959

even if it did not win the osca it win many hearts and praise from almost every one who saw it, and will go on to become a classic,unlike those that win the awards, predicable as they were , as they showed violence, men lead movies, etc or to banal for me to go into.  This one should have taken away a whole multitude of awards but because the powers that be cannot see past their own prejudice it did not but it has taken away with our hearts anyway,the actors stepped over their highest standards in this movie and that is not saying anything new re these brilliant actresses and actors, the director simply put together one of the most beautifully realized movies and one of the most romantic movie with just a touch of danger,and of torment to keep in in the loop.

7540546,4,B0185P7LO4,"I'm a great fan of Cate Blanchett and enjoy watching her superb acting and hearing her dreamy, alluring voice. The movie certainly defines 'less is more.'  Fine acting by both lead characters, their facial expressions and body language conveying so much more than speaking it out loud, feelings emerging softly as if in a slow dance.  In one particular scene Therese does not answer Carol (Blanchett), but you see her breathing deeply demonstrating heavy inner emotions. The film captured the era beautifully and the love scenes were in good taste befitting the actresses. Blanchett brings to life a woman of quiet strength, haughty resiliency and anguish caught between a mother's love of child and who she really needs to be. I especially applaud seeing two very feminine women drawn to each other, and the subtle developing display of romantic interest in one another.  Note - You might find Therese's (Mara) shy nature too quiet. We get to know Carol's personality but not so Therese.  We can surmise somewhat about Carol, yet it's vague when figuring out Therese. A little background on her would have been nice as apparently it is in the book which I have not read, only excerpts which is why I did not rate 5 stars.  I highly recommend.",1458691200,,1243,4.84433962264151
7540547,1,B0185P7LO4,"If you're thinking to see and hear Cate Blanchett deliver her usual splendor, think again. In this film she lowers her natural voice about an octave, in an apparent effort to seem older and more mature than she actually is. What comes across is an annoyingly forced and strained performance. She sounds like a girl in a high-school play who is trying to sound middle-aged. Its that bad and that distracting.

One of the greatest expenses in the movies we pay to see is in supplemental lighting. Apparently it was not an expense in the making of this one. Whatever the ambient indoor lighting happened to be, that was the sole source of light employed. The result is a depressingly dark and gloomy atmosphere. Facial shadows look ominously heavy. The movie begs for light and air and relief from enforced sadness. The visible film grain incurred when film (or digital medium) is badly underexposed is very effective in pulling the viewer out of the scene.",1458691200,3,954,4.781818181818182

7540549,2,B0185P7LO4,"The first thing to think about is that all lesbian films automatically get boosted in stars based upon the lack of good lesbian films being made. I looked at Carol as I would any other movie. After seeing the trailers, I was not expecting the film to be shot in 50's GRAINY quality. Some might find that to put them more in the story. I found it annoying- especially watching on a laptop. The ""sex scenes"" are very PG not what women raved about. The story is only halfway interesting- it would be interesting 60 years ago but not today. Basically, you are watching 2 people eat dinner in silence for 2 hours, one issue with a husband, and then a few kisses. This was a time when the writer should not have stuck to the original book storyline.

Cate Blanchett does an extraordinary job. However, she can't pull up her co-star. That girl has zero personality to the point that she must be medicated.",1458691200,2,898,4.442424242424242

7540576,5,B0185P7LO4,"Before you start watching this marvelous film, arm yourself with a box of tissues, a wet cloth to help clear your eyes, you will need it. This was one of the most wonderfully sad and wonderfully acted films of the year.

Cate Blanchette plays Carol Aird, and this beautiful woman is one of the most luminous women I have ever seen. Her beauty is undeniable, and she shines throughout this role. With a glimpse, a low murmur or chuckle, you know the scene, she has conveyed the meaning without words. I cannot explain the radiance this woman has, and her power to command the entire scene, without even trying. Carol lives among the 1%, as we know them now, she is in the midst of a divorce with her husband, Harge. The love of Carol's life is her daughter Rinty, age 4. Her love for the girl glows. And, of course, we see trouble ahead.

At a department store, Carol meets Therese Belivet, played by Rooney Mara. Therese is a salesgirl and sells Carol a large Christmas gift. Carol leaves her gloves, Therese sends them to her, Carol invites her out to lunch, and from that moment we see a love affair. This is a tender, true love, and it seems it cannot endure. Patricia Highsmith wrote the book the film is based on. It may be a love affair the author had, or not, but the exquisite writing transfers to the film. I cannot emphasize the acting, Blanchette takes over the role as no other, maybe since Meryl Streep. Blanchette commands every scene, and Rooney Mara is a close second. I have not seen a film in which I was so entranced. Everything about the film tears at our heartstrings. See this film, you will,not regret it.

In contrast to some of the critics, I could see why Carol and Therese were attracted to each other (I thought Mara outshone Blanchett here, even though Blanchett's role was the showier of the two). Therese was pure, inexperienced, living a relatively uncomplicated life. Pretty in a plain way. Carol, to me, seemed predatory, bordering on lecherous. But also sultry, glamorous, and worldly. That hair! Those nails! I thought that what she did to Therese was unfair, given the state of tumult in her life with her husband and child. And that's why I didn't like the ending, however ambiguous it was played, however realistic it might have been in terms of a love affair. I did see the nod to Brief Encounter, a much better film in my opinion, where nuance easily conveys the passion that exists between two people who hardly know each other.

Moments of silence, laughter, a look, a glance, and of words...I was surprised at how much impact the story had on me. What an amazing cast, truly a labor of love and passion.

7540599,5,B0185P7LO4,"Carol is absolutely stunning in all senses of the word. A masterclass of powerful restraint. Both Blanchett & Mara are exquisite; their sensual connection is overwhelming. Support from Paulson & Chandler is solid, sympathetic. Cinematography uses street photography images to conjure up post-WWII New York. Sandy Powell's costumes are spot-on as always. Carter Burwell's score mixes well with off-beat standards of the period. We are transported back to the early 1950s - gritty & anxious - not the rose-colored memories of our Disney-fied youth. Nagy's script strips the sometimes-plodding Highsmith novel to its basic elements & events move very quickly with all the extraneous material purged. As a film it works better than the best-seller on which it is based. This is an embarrassment of riches, as they say, since both Blanchett & Mara give career-best performances. This is the best of director Haynes' work, focusing on the strong emotions evoked when one first falls in love. No political agenda. No cynicism. The only cinematic ""trick"" is the use of a structural formula lifted from ""Brief Encounter""; it works, adding an element of mystery to the proceedings. He has left his ego at the door and put all his skills to the service of the story. Blanchett has been attached to this project for several years, since she first discovered Highsmith's work while working on ""The Talented Mr Ripley."" She stuck with it through cast & director changes & we should all thank her for her perseverance, along with the folks at Killer Films.

It is a slow burn that runs the risk of not being enjoyed by the ""I want things now"" crowd. The film is subtle and more is said in glances then any words can convey. There is no overt flirting nor fluffy declarations of love. With a setting in the early 1950's, an era in which the love between two women could land one in jail or worse an asylum, the subtlety feels true and accurate.
Carol (Blanchett) is a suburban housewife divorcing a husband she does not love and Therese (Mara) is a young woman learning what it is to be herself. Together they leave the shells of their prior existences. They save one another.

7540627,1,B0185P7LO4,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Poor writing, theatrical acting, and a lot of ""artsy"" shots that replace conversation.

First, the two main characters NEVER have a complete conversation about anything. Thus, it's hard to figure out what it is, if anything, they had in common. There were a lot of shots of Therese looking through a window, and Carol squinting at Therese, and Sarah Paulson's character smoking. Cate Blanchett, who I like very much, was simply miscast and misdirected. Was the character supposed to be a trapped mom? Or an out lesbian with no apologies? She was kind of both which just didn't fit. Paulson should've been cast as Carol, and Blanchett as Paulson's character. Rooney Mara just looked scared the whole time, which was extra irritating and had a lot to do with the lack of direction she was given.

The story wasn't believable. The love didn't seem real. The ending was desperate and predictable.",1457913600,9,943,4.808641975308642

7540638,5,B0185P7LO4,"CAROL is a touching story about the love relationship between two women.

Adapted from a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the film is set in the early 1950s and centers on Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), an aspiring photographer, currently working as a salesgirl in a large New York department store during the Christmas season.  Carol (Cate Blanchett), a married older woman going through a divorce, comes to the store one day to buy a gift for her daughter.  There is an immediate connection between her and Therese, which intensifies after the younger girl returns the gloves that Carol had accidentally left behind in the store.

Soon the two women are vacationing together on a cross-country driving trip, but disaster soon strikes when their illicit relationship (Remember, this is the early 1950s) is recorded by a private detective (Cory Michael Smith) hired by Carols estranged husband (Kyle Chandler), who sues for full custody of the couples young daughter.

With CAROL, director Todd Haynes (FAR FROM HEAVEN) has, once again, magnificently transported us back to an earlier time and place while engaging our emotions in a story that might not suit all tastes.  The cast, which includes Sarah Paulson and Jake Lacy, is uniformly superb.

The Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains excerpts from Q&A sessions featuring the movies stars and filmmakers, as well as a Behind the Scenes gallery.

Their love is not so much said in words as it is said in subtle looks and gestures. It must be taken into consideration the time period this took place. It is about first love. First heartbreak. Learning who you are and recognizing in others what is inside of you. Self discovery and having the courage to sacrifice to stay true to yourself. The Director really puts you in the 1950's as if you were there witnessing first hand. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara give true, authentic and in the moment performances. They take you on their journey with them. For Cate, sacrificing and finding the courage to be true to herself in a time it was not natural to do that. For Rooney, experiencing love and hearbreak for the first time and in the process finding herself and her voice.

The actresses, sets and clothes are beautiful, but there is little dialogue, not much story.  The characters were not interesting to me either.  Generally I love quiet, understated films about complex people that keep me thinking after the film ends.  I kept waiting for these characters to reveal some depth.  To me, they were two stereotypes from another era.  They couldn't reveal their true feelings due to heavy consequences, so nothing much develops.  Predictably, the men are clueless jerks.  A sympathetic male character would have been a nice touch.  I will try watching it again and will revise my review if I feel differently then.

Beautifully shot in 16mm the film is short on dialogue but is rich in nuanced nonverbal looks between the women involved.  The soundtrack is haunting, tender and reflective and really enhances the tender developing love story.

It's almost as if I could sit back and study every frame.  Worth noting Hayne's influences--still photographers like Orkin, Leiter, etc.  While I appreciated watching it (multiple times) in the theater, it wasn't until I was able to watch the HD version at home that I could actually hear the sound mix.  There are many layers to this film and so I look forward to adding it to a small collection of films that I can watch repeatedly and still experience something new each time.

The film differs quite a bit from the novel, but both are worthy are their own merits.  It's too bad in some ways that the story could not have been told like Campion's 'Top of the Lake' where it could have been fleshed out more rather than confined to the 2-hour window prescribed by theatrical release.  I could see this being a 6-hour, 3 part affair where to road trip (and love story) unfolds in a more leisurely, yet rich fashion similar to that found in the novel.

7540700,1,B0185P7LO4,"I have to agree with the other one star reviews. The whole film seemed like it was in slow motion, embarrassingly leading up to Cate Blanchett and her costar making out.  It was so obvious that was supposed to be the big payoff for suffering through one silent, interminable car ride after another.

I think the audience was supposed to be sated with no dialogue and just gazing upon all the vintage cars, and Cate's wardrobe.

We have really no GOOD reason why the two of them are together, going from motel to motel (maybe I missed something skipping a couple of minutes here and there), I've seen more chemistry between a couple of fence posts.

Ponderous and amateurish would be an understatement, and they have the nerve to leave the ending up in the air.

Sorry, Cate.  Awful",1457136000,12,781,4.58273381294964
7540701,5,B0185P7LO4,"Carol is a beautiful love story, from beginning to end. There are shades of Anna Karenina in the plot, and shades of Pride & Prejudice in the intricate detail of the setting. The ending moments are welcome surprises as well. Carol takes the time to develop, like one of Therese's photographs. The slow pace pays off wonderfully.

I've often felt that art is defined by how the artist explores his or her boundaries, and the development of the relationship between Carol and Therese is constrained by the society that they live in. But even if the director's ""canvas"" is limited, the final product is really something to behold even if it doesn't make immediate sense to modern viewers.

7540709,5,B0185P7LO4,"After watching Carol I was lost for words. I am still in a way. I feel no word can describe properly how I feel about this movie. It's so beautiful, subtle, surprising and heartwarming.
I adore this film because it's about love, about falling in love. It really doesn't matter if it happens between two women, two men or one man and one woman. Because love is above all.
Phyllis Nagy's script is brilliant, she achieved to adapt the novel with such talent and respect. It's different from the book, but it doesn't mean it's worse. It's one of those rare cases when the movie is as good as the novel (or even better).
Todd Haynes's direction is flawless for me. The pace of the movie, the colors, the images reflect very well the 50s and he was able to direct Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Mara with such talent that everything seems so natural in the movie. I didn't have a dull moment while watching it. I fell for it completely. As I felt for Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They are perfect together, they have such chemistry on screen that the relationship between Carol and Therese seems so real. They can understand each other only from glances. They don't even have to say anything we can feel their love through the gestures and gazes.
And last but not least, this movie wouldn't be the same and wouldn't have had the same effect on me without Carter Burwell's beautiful music. I love the fact that there is no separate themes for the characters because they exist when they are together.",1455580800,52,1488,4.514814814814815

When Carol's past begins to catch up with her she is afraid it will effect Therese and has a difficult decision to make. This is a movie to watch for the acting. The acting is amazing in this, but the movie is agonizingly slow moving. It is a character piece and I know that not much action is expected though. The movie is well written and directed but I just had a hard time really getting into it. Many people will like this I think but just as many, or more, won't. A movie that may be for true cinephilias only. Overall, not bad, little slow and is defiantly not for everyone. I give this a B-.",1455062400,4,923,4.28
7540712,4,B0185P7LO4,"I have been a fan of Cate Blanchett for over a decade and admit I attended this film to see her performance.  However, I left the theater feeling this was really Rooney Mara's film.  It was heartbreaking to watch her character try to make sense of the deep emotions she was feeling for the first time in her young life.  During the film, I was also struck by how much Mara physically looked like Audrey Hepburn at times, particularly in the taxi scene at the beginning and end of the film. It was wonderful and quite breathtaking to see the similarity.  I am a bit sad Mara is Oscar nominated for best supporting actress rather than lead, as her character is really the emotional heart of this film.  It is a quiet movie but still rich for the senses, with Cincinnati standing in for 1950s New York City.  Having spent a good bit of time in Cincy as a kid, I was pleased to see familiar landmarks.  Director Todd Haynes has really made a thoughtful and detail-oriented film here... definitely a film worth seeing once.",1454803200,13,1018,4.47027027027027

7540715,5,B0185P7LO4,"Love has a name and it is Carol.  Is that hyperbole?  Yes, but it is also well-founded.

This is a magical movie and of a type that I fear may come along only once in my lifetime.  So far it is the first that has struck all of the notes for me; what I've waited for in nearly 60 years of life.  I thank all involved for giving me such a masterpiece.  Pre-ordered and can't wait.  The movie is still playing somewhat near here and I'm hoping to see it today.  Edit:  I did see it again and the theater was full.

Acting, directing, writing, cinematography, design, wardrobe, and music are all top notch.
And for anyone looking at this as just a gay niche movie, well to be clear it is about two women falling in love.  If you're squeamish or out and out anti-gay, then you probably won't like it.  But if you're open to love and able to see beyond a narrow scope, you just may find something in this movie that no longer seems to exist within all of the formulaic films created today. It is the idea that sometimes words are not sufficient or just can't be expressed when falling in love.  This is further compounded when the love one feels is not allowed and when one heartfelt glance or one minor act of public affection, if observed, could have a devastating impact on the rest of life.  It examines how the two women seek to reveal themselves to each other without letting anyone else in, and within the fear of being wrong about what they believe the other is feeling.

It has one tastefully done and non-gratuitous sex scene.  This scene is important to the story for many reasons, and is far less revealing than most sex scenes involving non-gay couples.

There may be spoilers ahead because it is just so darn difficult to say what I liked/loved about this film without explaining some of the parts and points I feel it was making.

As one reviewer put it, many among us may have lost the ability to understand silence, to appreciate subtle, furtive glances, the turn of a head, the meaning of a touch, but this movie, its director, the actors, everyone involved in the project, they all understand.  There are real differences in how both of the women in this react to others in their lives when compared to how they react from the very first to each other.  As well, there are differences between the opening scene and the same scene that comes much later in the movie.  It's one of perspective.

When Carol looks at Therese, her emotions well up in her eyes.  But when she looks at Harge, there is nothing hinting at such a thing.  And that is great acting.  When Therese is touched one the shoulder briefly by Carol, she is moved.  But when Jack touches her there's no reaction.  The too is great acting.

This seems to be simply a tale of two women who meet, feel attraction, follow that attraction, and then are interrupted by the conflict of Carol's divorce and the question of custody of her young daughter.  But this idea of the possession of another person has an even more base meaning.  Possession of the child is the most obvious conflict, but there are subtexts involving whether anyone should or can truly possess anyone else.  The two women are seen as possessions, even trophies.  But perhaps never as fully formed people that should have wills of their own.  The fact of custody of Rindy was always pre-determined, if Carol was to be herself.  But, while love can make one give up ownership of one's heart willingly, the film makes it clear that every person should be able to express who they are within a relationship.

The movie isn't substantially about being gay as much as it is about following your heart and being able to love who you love.

This is long, but expresses some of my thoughts on how good the movie is.  As Cate Blanchett said in one interview, it couldn't have been made before now because they had to wait for Rooney Mara to be born.  I agree.

To be clear the film is essentially about two women falling in love, but that is not the only thing it is about.  In terms of love, it is also about what we should be, what we must be for anyone that we love and that loves us.

For Carol, the underlying current is who can she be for herself, Therese, and her daughter and even the lesser idea of who can she be for her husband.  Perhaps at one time she did love him, but on another level, just as one might love others that float about in our lives, she still does care about him, no matter how badly he has treated her.  She intrinsically understands why he is doing what hes doing and its caught up in his love of her or his attachment to her and his love of his daughter.

She loves her daughter definitely, but can she be of value to her daughter if she has been gutted and is dying on the inside?  For a time, she thinks its enough for all of them, to try to keep up appearances and to keep her relationship with her daughter intact, but what is she then teaching her?  And who is she really?

For a time, yes thats enough, but then Therese enters her life and reminds her what its like to love and to want more, to expect more than just going through the motions of life.  Life is about connections that matter.  Almost every gay person should be able to relate to this idea of how we are connected to others in our lives and what coming out, in pieces or in whole, can mean if only to ourselves and our perception of how others feel about it.  Relationships, of necessity do change, and it may not be in how others treat us, but in how we feel about ourselves.  Anyone, not just gays, who goes through some sort of identity question, divorce, a death, financial status change, and so on, can relate to this change in our connections.  We all have them and they change.  What we should always be striving to do, is to be ourselves, to be genuine, to thine own self be true.  How can you ever know if someone truly loves you, if you are not being yourself?

The appearance of Therese in Carols life sparks this understanding within her.  It takes her time to find her center (missing from the mirror when shes brushing Rindys hair), but she must find it.  And Therese is on her own journey as well, having to find the voice to say no, having to demand that others hear her, ask her what she wants, ask her what they want, instead of just assuming their desires are hers.  She has to become.  This is the meaning of the Tea Scene near the end as well as the ending itself.  But within that scene Therese also learns that you can't just randomly always say no any more than you can always say yes.

So much of the movie is filtered, faces and scenes obscured by the things that separate them, by what clouds their ability to be together, but there are some moments of clarity.  One exists when all the voices die down and Carol says, I love you.  If the audience felt the movie lacked these 3 words earlier on, the genius of their placement is to be explored.  They come at a time when Carol has nothing left, when Therese has basically spurned every attempt she has made at regaining whats been interrupted/severed.  And Carol is almost pleading throughout the conversation.

The I love you implies a goodbye perhaps, but elicits such a reaction from Therese, and the moment drowns out the rest of the world, it is clear to us that for the first time they both understand what it was all about.  But, they understand it separately.  Carol seems to be saying that goodbye and Therese is ready once again to merely react to what shes been told, rather than decide what it means to her.  Its clear what it means and she reacts as if shes been struck, but shes still reacting and not deciding.  In effect she has been struck, so ready to lash out at Carol, shes hurt her tremendously and now sees that Carol didn't abandon her at all.  The question she must be asking herself is what have I done?

Carol fairly rushes out, putting distance between herself and the pain as realization hits Therese.  Therese does then figure it out, sees in every interaction with Carol that this has been about love and love is Carol.

The ending itself is the final act of clarity.  We see Therese leaving a party where she feels no connection to anyone, even the woman trying to hit on her.  The vapid nature of their conversation irritates her.  So for her it isn't about an overwhelming attraction to women and any woman, but rather the falling in love with one specific person who happens to be a woman.  Has she lost that?

She sees the light, she walks past and through male/female couples, past men.  And past one final man who tries to stop her.  Her view is again obscured, but this time its up to her to clear it.  She again wades through people as the music swells and their voices die down, because all thats important is Carol.  And when they are at last face to face, both understanding what they are to one another and what they might be for themselves, there is full clarity.  And there is no fade out, to imply a slow fade to black within their lives and relationship.  This is the end.  The cut is dramatic and meaningful, like putting an exclamation point on that I love you.

A true masterpiece in its pacing, its ambience, its passion (understated at times, but extremely powerful and meaningful), and its intent.
This is a movie meant to be savored, meant to let you feel and think and imagine.  It is meant to be watched and it will not tell you everything in words.  The meaning often exists within the silent spaces.

And every audience that has been in place when Ive seen it has mostly sat silently watching from start to finish and after.  Every viewing has included a diverse group.

My favorite movie of all time, and Im old enough to have seen a wide spectrum that involved changes in the Hollywood conscience, from movies that always had happy endings, to those that never did, to those that had some supposed quixotic ending that meant the audience should make their own ending (cant say too many did that very well), to the CGI blockbusters, and many many more.  Ive loved some, hated some, and felt dumbfounded by others.

For me this is about simmering glances, stolen looks that last slightly longer than they should, secret moments that each attempts to keep hidden from each other.  It is about the lilt of a voice, the break in confidence heard in words, moments of discovery, including that all too brief exhilaration of a night of shared passion, broken in a real act of violation.  The look on both their faces, Thereses melting gaze and Carols broadening smile gives a sense of whats to come and even evokes some pain at what theyve had to go through, even with each other, to get to the moment.  It made me cry.

Everyone will have their own opinions as it should be, but this movie seems to intentionally break the mold of what we think a story arc should be and it doesnt insult in doing so. They don't have enough stars for this.",1454716800,21,10905,4.385151968111609
7540716,5,B0185P7LO4,"Before anyone bashes me, I want to clearly state that I am extremely biased in favor of this movie. I am 68 years old, a lesbian who has been ""out"" and about since I was 21, and I lived through this era.  Though I was very young in the '50s, I had an early (age 10) awareness of being different than other girls my age.  At a cellular level, I also knew HOW I was different, though I certainly had no language to articulate what was going on inside me. I had the wisdom though, even then, to know that I would not have an easy life if I followed my heart. Just so you know where I am coming from.

When I first heard Highsmith's book ""The Price of Salt"" was being made into a film, I was concerned.  I've read much of Highsmith's
work and enough biographical material to feel like I know her.  Her crime novels are amazing; she really nails the sociopathic mind.  And I believe some of that had to do with who Highsmith herself was.  She could really get under the skin of a character, because the skin fit her like a well-made Italian glove.  She was a brilliant writer, an interesting personality, but not ""warm and fuzzy"" at all.  I liked ""The Price of Salt,"" but I didn't love it.  And I really wanted to love it.  I wanted to love the characters, to feel vested in the outcome of their struggle to claim their truth and experience their passion for each other.  However, I found Highsmith's portrayal of these characters disappointing and wooden.  I often wondered if because she was such a sad character herself, she had never experienced/given deep, deep love to another human being that was returned to her in equal proportion to what she gave.  As a book lover who happens to be a lesbian, I have sought literary material all my life that depicts honest, loving relationships between women.  There is almost nothing on the bookshelves. Aside from pulp fiction, there have been few solid stories about women loving women, and even fewer that are beautifully crafted with characters you grow to care about that both survive the story and have a ""future"" together.  So it looks like I am being forced to write that beautiful book I've always longed for --myself.  Stay tuned.

The same has been true of films through the years.  Recently, there have been portrayals of strong lesbian characters on the screen.  I could be wrong, and someone will tell me if I am, but I do not remember any QUALITY lesbian love stories -- romances -- that have been depicted on the screen.  By quality I mean:  Great story; amazing cinematography; brilliant script; performances by truly gifted actors; a dreamy, mesmerizing music score; faithful depiction of an era in sets, costume design and lighting.  That is, until ""Carol.""

In February 1968, I had been married to a man for just one month when the movie ""The Fox,"" came out.  It was the first commercial movie in my memory that depicted a relationship between two women.  The only physicality between the two women was a kissing scene with both women fully clothed. That movie was my epiphany, the moment when I realized I was not living my truth.  The physical feelings I had watching those two characters kiss, awakened my soul for the first time in my life.  I left the theater that night a very different person than when I walked in to it two hours earlier.  And that night would be the beginning of a journey that led me to a life of love and authenticity that I might never have known otherwise.  Or I may have found myself later, but only after living years of lies and bringing heartbreak to future children.  Not to mention building a false life with a man that may have gone on for years, only to break his heart in the end.  At the time I saw the movie, I knew no other women like me.  However, the universe works in strange ways.  Within months I would meet many wonderful women -- who loved women -- who had been living in a parallel universe, in plain sight all my life.  I just never knew they were there.  ""The Fox"" was a catalyst for me.  But oh, how I wish there had been other movies then that showed true love, romance and caring between women.  Something that accurately represented the lives of women who are different.

So you can imagine I was over the moon when I learned Todd Haynes' name was attached to ""Carol"" and that the screenplay was being written by Phyllis Nagy, herself a lesbian.  Together, perhaps they could take the framework of ""The Price of Salt"" and hang a truly memorable love story on it.  And boy did they ever do that!

I've seen a lot of interviews with the cast, director and others associated with bringing this wonderful film to life, and I often hear them say, ""It's not just a story about two women in love...it's about the experience of falling in love.""  In a sense, they are correct.  Because ""falling in love"" is a universal feeling.  We all, no matter who we love, experience the same sorts of feelings, insecurities, craziness at times, reacting and acting in ways that make no sense to ourselves or anyone else observing us, falling in love with people we seem to have little in common with, living dangerously sometimes to spend time with the person our hearts ache to be with.  ""It's just love, love, love,"" as Cate Blanchett has said in several interviews.

I am not a lesbian separatist.  I have lots of men friends, and I adore romantic movies with substance, no matter what they are.  But I can tell you I have a special affection for THIS romantic movie.  I love it not only because it depicts love between two characters I can relate to, but because the project in its entirety reflects so much talent.  It is obvious from the first frame to the last, that every person attached to this project LOVED what they were creating.  Each frame of the film is a stand-alone work of art.  I have seen the movie in the theater three times, and each time I see more about it to love.

I respect everyone's opinion, even those who ""hated"" the movie, found it too slow, found it too unemotional.  I hear you.  But that is not the movie that my eyes saw or that my ears heard.  I thought the chemistry between Cate Blanchett's Carol and Rooney Mara's Therese was absolutely pitch-perfect.  I picked up on every longing gaze, every flirtatious gesture.  Remember, I've been there before.  And I thought the single love-making scene was just...perfect.  I felt both their passion and their caring for each other.  The kissing scene later was equally moving; I felt that it cemented their love for each other.  And the last scene was breathtaking.  However, if you are not a sensitive person, you might easily miss the subtle changes in both the characters facial expressions in the last few seconds before the screen goes dark.  This is a movie that begs you, demands that you--PAY ATTENTION.  And if you do not, you will miss one of the most beautiful scenes in film history.  Everything was written on their faces....everything.

Well, I've gone on long enough.  But I do want to thank EVERY SINGLE person who put their talent, time, love, and caring--as well as those who put up the money --that went into the making of  Carol:  Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Todd Haynes, Ed Bachmann, Phyllis Nagy, Carter Burwell (Brilliant, haunting, moving score and do buy the CD--you will love it so much, you will wear it out so maybe buy two copies)., Elizabeth Karlsen, Stephen Woolley, Christine Vachon, and everybody else I left out.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for the amazing gift of ""Carol.""

By the way, I have the Blue-Ray version of this film on order from Amazon.  Great price.  And I think it will be released March 15.  Order it now!  You will want to OWN this movie.  Most of the reviews coming in for Carol are very favorable.  And I have to tell you that each time I saw the movie, the audience was comprised of mostly straight couples.  So everyone ""gets"" the universality of its ""falling in love"" theme.",1454630400,82,7931,4.525686136523575

7540721,5,B0185P7LO4,"Todd Haynes has made some solid films (Velvet Goldmine, Far From Heaven, Im Not There, etc) and he manages to move his cast of characters in this sensitive film based on Patricia Highsmiths 2004 novel The Price of Salt  to equal the impact and timing of Highsmiths concept in her novel. Phyllis Nagy adapted the novel for the screen.

According to Highsmiths story, Therese (Rooney Mara) is nineteen and working in a department store during the Christmas shopping season. She dates men, although not with real enthusiasm. One day a beautiful older woman comes over to her counter and buys a doll. As the purchase is a C.O.D. order, Therese makes a mental note of the customers address. She is intrigued and drawn to the woman. Although young, inexperienced and shy, she writes a note to the customer, Carol (Cate Blanchett), and is elated and surprised when Carol invites her to meet. Therese realizes she has strong feelings for Carol, but is unsure of what they represent. Carol, in the process of a bitter separation and divorce, is also quite lonely. Soon the two women begin spending a great deal of time together. Before long, they are madly and hopelessly in love. The path is not easy for them, however. Carol also has a child and a very suspicious husband dangerous ground for the lovers. When the women leave New York and travel west together, they discover the choices theyve made to be together will have lasting effects on both their lives. Considered to be the first lesbian pulp novel to break the pulp publishing industry-enforced pattern of tragic consequences for its lesbian heroines, The Price of Salt was written under the pseudonym of Claire Morgan by Patricia Highsmith  the author of Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley.

Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant in this delicate story. Sarah Paulson adds depth as Carols previous lover Abby. The flavor of the 1950s is superb as is the cinematography and musical score. The only casting problem is with the men  blustering insensitive performances especially by Kyle Chandler as Carols husband-on- the-way-out disrupt the flow of the film distractingly. Otherwise it is a triumph for all concerned. Still highly recommended. Grady Harp, January 16",1454198400,11,2244,4.941644562334218

And it gets better and better upon subsequent viewings because there is so much buried within this quiet, subtle film that can easily be overlooked the first time you watch, but later when you see things like the parallels in shots as Carol and Therese switch places in their positions of vulnerability or the brilliance of the cinematography that creates barriers between the audience and the women through windows and doorways thus reflecting the same barriers they experience due to the restrictions of the 1950s society, or the score that sweeps you up in its hypnotic embrace so you feel as if you, like Therese, are in something of a trance until the very end. The direction, the writing, the costumes, the production design are fantastic. And then there's the acting, which has so many layers to unpack that you're able to find new moments along the way to give you greater insight to what Carol and Therese are feeling which you might have missed earlier. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are perfect here. It's all in their eyes and breathing. Watch closely if you want to know what both of these guarded, lonely characters are truly feeling because it won't necessarily be in what they say, and they have a lot to say.",1453852800,9,1316,4.726086956521739

Even so I was not prepared to like it as much as I did. I was totally engaged from start to finish and there is no flaw to me. The script, by Phyllis Nagy, does a wonderful job of conveying the essence of Highsmith's novel and staying true to its existential tone. The acting is phenomenal. Blanchett matches her previous great performances and then some. But Mara is a revelation. Every time I see it, and I've seen it a number of times, I have more appreciation for how nuanced her acting is and how completely she inhabit is the character of Therese. Haynes' movies are always so dense that they need a number of viewings to really comprehend the picture. Here the composition, scene by scene, is so amazing that each viewing brings forth new observations and understanding. The photography, by the great Ed Lachman, makes the grain and tone of the film itself an intriguing element. I can't wait for the dvd to come out so that I can watch scenes in isolation to see why they are so impactful. The warning I have is that people who can only see a film that conforms to current standards of pace and action may find it slow or boring.

7540726,3,B0185P7LO4,"I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett, and have loved her in almost everything she does.  Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character.  Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women.  She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.

I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film.  I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often).  But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film.  But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything  happening in the inner-lives of the characters either.  CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.

Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen).  Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s).  On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter.  The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time.  Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT.  But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol.  Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!

I get it...in the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden.  But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together.  Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind).  I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend).  She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings.  And occasionally she sounds like she's drunk...her speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.

But Blanchett is the biggest miss here.  I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well.  She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind).  But here she seems nearly vacuous.  She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep hidden...and she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)

The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them.  The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected.  It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.

So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars.  Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable.  The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT).  Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice.  The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.

I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett.  So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film.  But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface.  Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment.  When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for awhile...we were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim.  We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with.  But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work.",1453680000,17,4892,4.575862068965518

7540728,5,B0185P7LO4,"The harmonious collaboration between Phyllis Nagy (screenwriter) and Todd Haynes (director) enables the movie called Carol to achieve its fullest fruition, to become a masterpiece of cinema. It is the skill and dedication of all its actors that bring the story of Carol to life for us to behold.

More specifically, for me it is Haynes' contribution of the bookends framing for the film, which allows for the ingenious means to visually tell the story from multiple points of view, as well as add a far greater depth of symbolism to appreciate, that elevates this movie towards its prodigious achievements. The story of Therese and Carol visually comes full circle, and it is a beautiful thing to witness and experience.

Nagy's maturity and wisdom parallels that of Highsmith's when she wrote the novel Carol, originally titled The Price of Salt, from which Nagy wrote the adapted screenplay. Nagy recognizes that the men in the lives of Carol and Therese should not be vilified, and such elevates the film to greatness by recognizing and honoring the different and equally valid human conditions inherent in love and loss. And yet, Nagy wrote in her screenplay certain changes that deviate from the novel's details, and these changes work better and brilliantly cinematically. For example, Nagy changed the toy that Carol decides to buy for her daughter as a Christmas present, at Therese's recommendation, from a doll to a train set (its circular path again referencing the visual and metaphysical circularity of the story). As well, the character Therese in the movie is written to be an aspiring photographer (whereas in the novel she is a novice set designer), and this change by Nagy works better cinematically. Nagy is said to also have insisted that the love scene between Therese and Carol preserve its passionate yet ordinary and vulnerable quality, enabling their consummation to reveal just how deeply they were falling in love with each other no different an experience than any other two people have when falling in love.

Life oftentimes imitates art. Artists teach us to find beauty, through art, where beauty may normally not exist. There is a scene in the movie where such is especially the case, and it is the sparingly used narrative overlay of Carol's voice here that teaches the viewer to recognize the beauty to be found in suffering once suffering's meaning is comprehended. When this happens in a movie, greatness has indeed been reached.

Thus, the movie Carol is a great movie, and to date the greatest movie I think that depicts the human experience of having loved and lost, of finding love with the hope of a more profound love that matures with time, and one that is specifically between two women.",1453161600,13,2730,4.967177242888402

Rating 2.5 out of 5.0

Unlike the sentimental melodrama ""Brooklyn,"" Director Todd Haynes has fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel ""The Price of Salt"" (later named ""Carol""). Like his predecessor, Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower ascends the ""throne"" of the American presidency for the first time. Despite all the positives, why then is ""Carol"" simply ""average"" and mediocre to boot?

When Highsmith's novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film's protagonist, Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the villain of the piece, Carol's rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge, invokes a ""morality clause,"" permitting him to gain full custody of the couple's young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having any visitation rights.

Carol's ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We're supposed to get excited about the two lovers' intense desire for one another but what's so original about a lesbian romance? It's simply not enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love in the ""presidential suite"" of a cheap motel.

But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge but eventually (wouldn't you know it?) is unable to shake her love and lust for dear Therese, and it's postulated at the climax that indeed they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades to black. I suppose the non-stop ""passion"" between the two principals is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr. Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphere mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to care about characters that are in need of much more detailed development.",1452816000,10,2645,5.015945330296128

7540734,4,B0185P7LO4,"Oscar followers are likely to search out this film as the two stars are both nominated in the acting category.  Rooney Mara was relegated to supporting actress but to be clear, she has as much screen time as the more established Cate Blanchett.  Are they worthy?  Hell yeah.  Todd Haynes who directed 2002s Far from Heaven, which has a similar theme of social taboos, guides this film with a steady, soft hand.

Separated from her wealthy business tycoon husband, Harge Aird (Kyle Chandler, reliable as always), Carol (Blanchett) strikes up a conversation with store clerk, Therese Belivet (Mara) while shopping for Christmas.  While Therese has a boyfriend (Jake Lacy), shes reluctant to commit.  When Carol leaves her gloves behind, Therese sends them to her.  Carol calls and invites her over.  Things simmer for a long time but it is clear there is both a physical and an emotional connection.  One missing from their current relationships.  Carol is no virgin when it comes to other women.  Her best friend and godmother to her daughter is a childhood friend played by Sarah Paulson was her first.  Things get ugly when Harge, who still loves Carol, uses their daughter Rindy as leverage to call off the pending divorce.

One of the things I loved about the film is the slow but even pacing.  In a time of blockbusters, its nice to once in a while just relax and let the story play out with temperance.  The sets and costumes in the film are truly wonderful.  I especially liked the authenticity of the clothing and the cars.

7540736,5,B0185P7LO4,"What can I say that so many other people have not already said about this beautiful movie? Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara give two of the best, understated performances of the year. Two women that are yearning for the one person in life that will make them feel whole, complete and loved, see each other one day across a crowded room. There is intrigue, confusion, contemplation, curiosity and the sparks of attraction. One exudes confidence but is seemingly fragile with her emotions, falling in love with someone when perhaps it wasn't love that she was initially looking for. The other, a quiet thinker that through her interactions with the other, feels that overwhelming sensation of a love so strong, that it almost feels like your suffocating, eventually grows into a woman that can finally say no.

The filming was beautiful capturing the essence of an era many of us have only read about or seen in the movies. The quiet, subtle exchanges, where body language such as nuanced mannerisms, vocal inflections, shifting eyes and the squeeze of a shoulder, mean so much more than words ever could. I love this, where the viewer is responsible for understanding what is going on inside the characters without being hit over the head with an explanation. Because of this, I felt the pain Therese felt, the fear that Carol felt and the undeniable attraction and blossoming love they felt for each other.

To see someone, across the room, that you've never seen before, the growing lump in your throat, the inability to swallow or blink, let alone move, the way the rest of the room disappears until it is only the two of you, the way in which your eyes smile and speak without saying a word...yeah, we've all felt that and the undeniable force that is pushing each person together. Love and attraction is magnetic, the pull towards a person cannot be fought, nor should it. Love is love. Embrace it. Own it. Life is short and no one should live it alone because of fear or ignorance of others. If there is one thing this movie can teach a person is, love, true love, is worth fighting and making sacrifices for because at the end of the day, every person should know what it's like to be happy.",1452470400,21,2195,4.669250645994832

However, the words I came away with were not so headlight blinding on a dark night; rather, the stillness caught me. And when the stillness ended only the perfectly necessary, perfectly nuanced, movement captured my eye and held me spellbound into the next stillness. And the Silences. When did we forget how a silence can speak a thousand thoughts and ideas and notions? When did we lose ourselves in this cacophony of voices, unceasing, these incoherent noises? And how can this newly found silence find us yearning, not for words, no; instead, we beg, leaning forward in our seats, holding our breath, waiting or wishing or dying for another glance or equally as satisfying (but now almost universally neglected) another gentle, almost intangible - except from the disturbance of air around it - brush of a hand on a shoulder, and then gasping for air as it finally arrives? When did we lose the ability to interpret in a glance (and maybe a barely distinguishable lift of the corner of a mouth with the exact right shade of lipstick) across the department store floor an existence of unrelenting and profound loneliness, of desolation, of hopelessness?  When did we lose the ability to say yes to life, and risk, and hoping the feeling in your gut is telling you this isn't the worst idea ever? Whenever we lost all these gifts: when we lost silence as an amplifier; when we lost the ability to translate a touch that speaks what we can't say aloud into ""I love you"" and ""I need you"" and ""I will be desolate without you;"" when we lost the ability to say with our eyes alone, ""you are the piece of me I didn't know was missing;"" when the choices were not an easily managed yes or no, but instead asked us the existence shattering, ""shall I give up my soul ... or my soul?"" I don't know when we lost all these gifts of communication, but I found them all here, watching a film in a small theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico;  and I was heartbroken and uplifted; terrified by the honesty and horrified by the cruelty in this world I was invited into; and yet, I am still loathe to go to another place, another time, where Carol and Terese are not speaking this language, where I am not the voyeur - the audience reeling with the profound reminders of how little we need speech, if only we commit to using every other sense to communicate.",1451865600,261,2544,4.528260869565218

7540744,5,B0185P7LO4,"This film is just as inspired as the book it is based on. It's worth seeing... it's worth owning. I felt it completely captured the raw emotions around being wildly lost for someone completely out of your league: the highs, the lows... where every glance and every touch is magnified and intensified, leaving you utterly submissive at her feet.

The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith was a powerful and elegantly written book when I read it as a young lesbian. Nothing else compared to it at the time and it actually had a hopeful ending. And here in 2015, I feel the movie takes an equally important and endearing place in its genre because it doesn't sell out to the hets and homophobia (as our films continue to do).  There are no pointless and gratuitous M/F sex scenes. No tragic headcases who depressed me for two hours and feed the long-standing misconception that we're all mentally ill. No lesbians die in the end!! The ending remains an utterly hopeful one.  And for once, IT'S NOT A PIECE OF S***!!!!!!!!!!! Ack, it's been years since I've been able to say that about a lesbian film!! LOL.

Carol is a rare effort where all aspects of the film are solid quality and beautifully align into the same elegant vision-- the writing, casting, acting, direction, cinematography, wardrobe, score, editing, etc... the overall effect is pure movie magic that draws you in and stays with you indefinitely. This is a movie I want to watch again. And again. :)

Set in 1950s New York, Carol chronicles the romance between a shy and girlish department store clerk and the older, elegant socialite who comes in to buy a Christmas gift for her young daughter. They lock eyes, transfixed, and the chemistry between them is off the charts. A friendly lunch date escalates into a visit to Carol's house in the country and then a road trip west.

It was pretty true to the novel (changes are slight, but effective).  In the book Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) is 19 and an aspiring theater set designer and Carol is 32. Here Therese seems to be a bit older in her 20s and an aspiring photographer and Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) seems a lot older than 32. But the differences that electrify their dynamics remain... Carol is older, taller, curvier, richer, classier, more confident, experienced, and elegantly predatory in the most delicious way... doe-eyed Therese is breathlessly smitten and helpless to her charms. It's hot.

But Carol is also vulnerable and the contradiction gives her much more depth and appeal.  She has a F/F past with her gay best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) and has reached a point in her life where she no longer wants to be trapped in a loveless marriage. And Therese is her bridge back to her more authentic self. But her freedom comes with a price as her husband will do anything to keep her.

I loved this movie. Beautifully filmed. Loved the leads and the chemistry they shared.  And I always love Sarah Paulson.  Highly recommended!!

7540749,5,B0185P7LO4,This is the most enjoyable movie I have seen in recent years.  I walked out of the theater wanting to see it again.  When the performances are this strong you are drawn into fabric of their story.  Watching a love come to life is an experience and resisting the prejudices of the time is almost heartbreaking.  These two people deserved each other and you can't help but crave their coming together.,1451088000,17,399,4.577464788732394
7540750,4,B0185P7LO4,"""Carol"" (2015 release; 118 min.) brings the story of divorcing Carol (played by Cate Blanchett), trying the escape an unhappy marriage, and the much younger Therese (played by Rooney Mara). As the movie opens, we see Carol and Therese having a coffee or tea in a posh hotel lobby. By happenstance, one of Therese's friends is there to meet someone too but comes over to say hello to Therese. Before we know it, Carol makes a hasty departure. Then we go back in time as we see how Carol and Therese meet in the toy department of a large department store. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose previous movie was the Bob Dylan interpretation ""I'm Not There"" (also co-starring Cate Blanchett. Here he tackles the big screen adaptation of the 1952 Patricia Highsmith novel The Salt of Price (originally published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan). Deemed too hot for the 1950s, the book was quickly dismissed and forgotten by the public at large, until it was rescued from oblivion and reissued in the early 90s. A story like this stands and falls with the lead performances, and Haynes has absolutely struck gold with both Blanchett and Mara. The Performance from Cate Blanchett (who played another impressive role in ""Truth"" just last month) is the more obvious one (has she ever looked more glamorous than this?), but Mara displays a vulnerability seldom seen and which will tug at your heart, and then some. If there is movie justice, they will both receive multiple nominations in the upcoming awards season.

I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the entire movie was shot in and around Cincinnati (including also Hamilton and Lebanon) in March-April 2014. For those of us living here, it was a lot of fun to pick out what parts of Cincinnati appeared in what scenes. (As a complete aside, my daughter ended up serving lunch one day to Blanchett, who could be seen frequently in and around downtown restaurants during the film's shoot. Apparently Blanchett couldn't have been nicer, and she left a very generous tip for my daughter.)

The movie opened on two screens at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati at Christmas, and the matinee screening where I saw this at today was absolutely PACKED, I am happy to report. Given the positive buzz that this movie is creating, and assuming great word-of-mouth and some Oscar nominations, this movie may very well build into a bona fide hit on the art-house theater circuit. Meanwhile, ""Carol"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1451088000,18,2619,4.815555555555555

8741513,3,B0185P7LO4,"I enjoyed the film to some degree. The period details were spot on, the visuals interesting. But there was a lack of character development that made me just not care. Too much innuendo. Maybe I need to be hit over the head, but this was too subtle.

The movie didn't suck me in, and when the two women finally consummate their relationship, I felt like I was watching two straight Hollywood actresses simulate sex for the camera. I never felt like I was witnessing two people falling in love. It seemed more like a predatory relationship, with Carol using Therese, and Therese merely wanting to find out what life is about.

There were a few interesting subtleties, like Carol's trick of leaving her gloves behind early in the film, a small cue meaning ""please contact me"", back in the day before you could just exchange cell phone numbers.

Worth seeing maybe, but somewhat overrated.",1531008000,,885,4.733766233766234

8741518,5,B0185P7LO4,"Absolutely beautiful. The casting was perfect. Both actresses were convincing in their roles. The dynamics, chemistry, and struggles between the two women made it electrifying to watch. The age-gap, the difference in social status, and the fact that this was a same-sex romance in the movie's time were portrayed elegantly. This was a gem. Highly recommended!",1528156800,,359,5.428571428571429
