2636556,4,B000HEVZAI,I was happy to see her back doing comedy! I rented this dvd from netflix and I was cracking up. Roseanne reminds us all at the end of her routine to not live in fear as she sings and dances in a tight body suit.,1313712000,,211,3.7111111111111112
2636557,5,B000HEVZAI,"A lot different than her tv show, but imo funnier.  Raunchy and political, but insightful and hilarious.  If you like George Carlin in his later years, then I would highly recommend this underrated stand-up performance.",1310515200,2,219,5.228571428571429
2636558,1,B000HEVZAI,"What happened to Roseanne?

Just look at the other reviews and it will tell you that this cricket-chirping static snoozefest is horrible.  ""The liberal goddess,"" says one.  ""I had a problem with the conservative audience of jerks,"" announces another.  These people aren't judging this show on its humor, they're applauding its slogans.  (You people should go check out Margaret Cho's lame DVDs since she's another incredibly unfunny comic who just bashes everything left of Hollywood).

I recently watched the Rodney Dangerfield DVD collection and saw Roseanne's debut on one of Rodney's HBO specials.  She was fresh, funny, she had an instant persona.

I have no idea who this woman is now.  Just another Left Coast limousine liberal scoring points on a pay channel where Bill Maher and Bunny Ranch prostitutes reign supreme.  I laugh at any comic that's funny, no matter what political affiliation they may be...they just have to be funny.

If Roseanne hadn't appeared so self-righteous and arrogant about her screeds (one could hardly call them jokes), I would've felt sorry for her.",1198800000,5,1086,5.148571428571429
2636559,4,B000HEVZAI,"It seems that since her tv show Roseanne has been lacking in her standup. Her old stuff was hilarious but then getting a cable tv show seemed to chang all that.

Yet she is absolutely hilarious in this special. At times she seems to be too preachy with some of her material (namely the government) but since I see both sides of things it didn't bother me so much. A lot of her material was on the floor funny but some was just boring, unfunny and trying too hard to be witty and failing.

Overall if you like her and her stuff and can laugh at a plethora of subjects, then watch this. If you can't take a joke at face value, stay away; it might offend you and your beliefs.",1191974400,2,673,4.129770992366412
2636560,4,B000HEVZAI,"It will do a heart good to find that Roseanne Barr is still funny.

Barr careens around society, skewering religion, diets, mental illness and drugs, getting old and parenthood. And, yes, like many other frustrated liberal comics, Barr can't resist explaining her hatred for Pres. Bush.

In an interview featurette on the disc, Barr says 9/11 was the impetus for getting off her butt and performing her new material. That also explains her show-stopping, fear-conquering finale, with a courageous kimono-dropping tapdance and her own take on Frank Sinatra's ""My Way.""

Don't miss the extras, especially two seemingly improvisational sketches that find Barr backstage before the show as straight woman to a heavily-made-up transvestite makeup artist and an absurd motivational coach who mixes so many metaphors, numbers and symbols that his message is deliciously stupid.",1161129600,16,870,5.477611940298507
2636571,1,B000HEVZAI,"Very bad, don't waste your time. One star is to high of a review.",1420848000,,65,3.7142857142857144
2636572,5,B000HEVZAI,"She lives up to the expectations with the title alone! Roseanne has been and always will be funny!!! I laughed throughout this entire stand up comedy special!!!

2636577,1,B000HEVZAI,"Rosanne doesn't need to stoop to such lows in order to be funny. This video was too homorlessly vulgar to tolerate for very long. If you don't like to watch a woman appear to enjoy degrading herself and her audience, don't waste your time or money on this one!",1416182400,,260,4.326530612244898

2636594,5,B000HEVZAI,"This starts a little slow, but after Roseanne gets going it's truly hilarious. Her fans will love her commentary about men, religion, and growing older. She's fearless. . . a real comedienne!",1409961600,,191,5.0
2636595,1,B000HEVZAI,"not funny, not amusing, just whining and complaining.  Mind you, i used to love her comedy, saw her live and laughed until i hurt.  This was not funny.",1408406400,2,151,4.357142857142857
2636596,5,B000HEVZAI,Love this lady.  No matter what you think of Roseanne - she tells it like it is- frank and to the point.  I loved her in TV shows and as a stand up comic she still is great.  Love you Roseanne keep up the good work.,1406937600,,215,3.630434782608696

2636613,1,B000HEVZAI,I laughed once or twice. It was just a very desperate (failed) attempt at shock humor. Really bad.,1405036800,,98,4.5
2636614,1,B000HEVZAI,LOVE ROSEANNE BUT THIS WAS NOT GOOD.,1405036800,,36,4.285714285714286
2636615,5,B000HEVZAI,"Hilarious. I was laughing uncontrollably so many times my husband had to hush me as not to disturb our neighbors--I was that loud. She is really right on with so many social issues and it's evident she has a deeper understanding than she projects. Her simple way of boiling things down without regard for political correctness is genius. She shocking but with a point. Her show is so layered that while I laughed even harder with her wit when over their heads, at the end I began to wonder what I had missed. I'll be rewatching and sharing this show with everyone I know. Thank you Roseanne--I've missed you.",1404864000,,608,4.587155963302752

2636617,5,B000HEVZAI,"I can't believe I hadn't heard of this before. I always enjoyed Roseanne's crude honesty and genuine human frailty. When she ran for President in 2008 I started to like her even more. In this show from 2006 she begins with the same wonderfully irreverent wit she became famous for. The objects (or targets) of her derision may have changed, but her daggers still hit the mark. The end of the show is truly amazing. Roseanne strips down to a leotard (yup!) and embraces and reveals her Self in a fantastically joyful manner. She then returns to the stage, robed, with feather boa and big sunglasses, to sing (yup!) an incredibly powerful rendition of ""My Way"". I was floored.",1403740800,2,674,4.6722689075630255
2636618,1,B000HEVZAI,I could not get past the first ten minutes. There was tons of body shaming and it was not funny.,1403568000,,96,3.85
2636619,3,B000HEVZAI,"The show is nicely shot and miked but Roseanne Barr is not as funny as she used to be when she had the Roseanne Show (and her standup before and during that).
You'll laugh a little but not a lot.",1402444800,,195,3.9
2636620,5,B000HEVZAI,So perfect! My type  of woman! I felt like she totally represented my feelings on all topics she covered. Left me wanting more! Love it!,1398902400,,136,4.44
2636621,5,B000HEVZAI,"This dvd is one of the best ones I own. Roseanne is hilarious in each second of this dvd. I'd recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor, especially those with a twisted sense of humor. She's funnier than ever, and I could watch this dvd over and over and never get sick of it. It's a must own for comedy fans for sure.",1394064000,2,323,3.9846153846153847
2636622,5,B000HEVZAI,"I wasn't an avid viewer of the Rosanne show, but I truly enjoyed her manner in this comedy routine.  True to form, there are some raunchy jokes, and I could relate to most of them.  There are also delightful innuendos showing Rosanne Barr's special personality.  I keep sharing it with my friends, both female and male.  Everyone is laughing.",1363305600,2,342,4.745762711864407
