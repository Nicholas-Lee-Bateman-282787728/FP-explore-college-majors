595052,5,6303209939,"For anybody who loved those early Benny Hill half-hours that were syndicated in the U.S. in the early 80s, you'll love this tape. It contains some of the best songs, skits and black-outs from that period. I received it as a Christmas present, and it was the best present I got that year. Any true fan of Benny would love it.",1012780800,16,324,4.327868852459017
595053,3,6303209939,"There really is no such thing as ""bad"" Benny Hill skits, but his earlier skits are far superior to what's on this DVD.  A few gems such as the hospital sketch and ""throw open your window"" are scattered between other material that you can either take or leave.  The transfer from Anchor Bay is excellent, and though lacking in bonus materials it's a decent disc for the price.
Aficionados of the naughty ol' man will enjoy this disc, but newcomers to Benny Hill may want to catch re-runs on PBS before buying this.  It's not the Best of Benny Hill, it's merely good.",1003190400,13,565,4.466019417475728
595054,2,6303209939,"I would have appreciated a more balanced presentation of the show. This DVD just contained a series of skits. The skits were good, but it would have been nice to include some of the musical numbers. The Benny Hill Show was a 'variety' show after all. The video quality was very disappointing. If they didn't have a good enough master source, they shouldn't have released it. Overall, it was nice to see some of my favorite skits, but I didn't keep the disc.",998956800,12,457,4.518072289156627
595055,1,6303209939,"I had VHS version with the same contents as this DVD. I decided to buy this dvd expecting to have better picture and some extras.
These are my truly technical comments about this DVD:  1) No extra features! No subtitles at all! If  a trailer is an extra then I'm wrong here. 2) Picture quality is really poor. It's so bad that my VHS version plays with much better picture quality than this DVD. (DVD Player is not the problem as it works fine with the rest of my DVD collection). Probably I will just throw it out and stay with VHS version. :(

595056,4,6303209939,"Ah yes. Benny Hill. Now there was classic slapstick comedy at its best. Perhaps one of the coolest comedians to come out of England, Benny Hill broke new ground in his brand of humor. Often pushing the envelope with racy sexy comedy for his time, he was a refreshing comedian more or less like a modern Chaplin with his silent comedy routines/sketches. This DVD seems to include his best moments from classic shows and it looks like it's going to be very good. If you never have been exposed to Mr Hill's humor, this is as good a place as any to give it a shot.",989798400,8,561,4.30188679245283
595057,3,6303209939,"This is a feature-length compilation of sketches from Benny Hill's long-running TV series. If you're at all familiar with the genial British comedian, you'll know what to expect: plenty of girls, plenty of puns, plenty of obvious visual humor, and plenty of eccentrics dashing from here to there. Some of the sketches run on a bit longer than necessary, others are short and sweet. Movie buffs will love two sketches in particular: 1) Benny is the star of a 1930s late-show movie, but the print is terrible (Benny and the cast ingeniously simulate splicy dialogue, projection at the wrong speed, etc.); 2) A cineaste -- Hill's straight man Henry McGee in a delightfully over-the-top performance -- interviews famed French director Benny, asking searching questions and getting matter-of-fact answers. Benny's monologues are fun, too -- his story of a little boy who befriends a bird is timed beautifully. A technical note: this was released as a theatrical movie but much of it was originally shot on videotape. Thus the image transferred to film is sometimes a little grainy, but it's nothing distracting. If you like simple, lowbrow burlesque comedy, you'll certainly enjoy this tape.",972950400,39,1186,5.150259067357513
595058,1,6303209939,"If you're looking for the best of British comedy, this is definitely not it. This is crass, sexist and stupid, and most suitable for those of low  intelligence. With that proviso, help yourself.",965260800,4,194,4.878787878787879
595059,5,6303209939,Benny Hill is One Of the Greatest Comedy Talents Ever! His Vision on His Shows always had me Rolling. He was not Only The Writer&Director but also Wrote The Music as Well. He was A Genius Of Humor.this is a Must.,959558400,41,212,4.195121951219512
595186,5,6303209939,In all of his shows on tv or on dvd he doesn't use bad language. He is funny and comes across like a naughty little boy who was caught doing what he shouldn't.

595189,5,6303209939,Benny Hill enough said as far as I am concerned. The fact that he wrote every skit and joke in all of his shows just blows me away. Also his shows were not 1/2 ones as shown in America. They even had singing sets in them.,1372982400,,221,3.8260869565217392
595190,4,6303209939,"Were there not an abundance of Benny Hill material available, this sampler would be tops.  Seasoned fans may be a little disappointed in what, at first blush, appears to be a limited amount of sketches and skits, but for the neophyte this is quite decent.  And really, for the price it is more than adequate to get you fix of Benny Hill.

For those trying Hill for the first time, you may have heard about varying degrees of sexism in Hill that may make his comedy at best dated and at worse offensive and less than politically correct.  I find this sentiment to be unfortunate; Hill did make comedy that held to the values of his day, but that does not mean at all that it does not hold up.  Not long ago, in 2006 maybe, the BBC did a special on asking whether or not Hill was still funny to a contemporary young audience who, in all probability had never seen The Benny Hill Show.  As I understand, young people of varying ilks found it funny and not offensive.  While I support political correctness in its most practical manifestations, rendering taboo a sketch comedy show for theoretically problematic material is foolish and points to an unfortunate sway of reason from common sense to a kind of cultural nihilism and serious spirit that threatens to turn us into a culture of dour, angry and resentful people.

So there is my rant and recommendation; if you haven't seen The Benny Hill Show this is a good place to start.  If you have and you love it, I recommend spending a little more and purchasing a larger collection.",1328054400,,1530,4.5144927536231885

595237,1,6303209939,"I knew that not all of his sketches were gems, but Benny Hill has done a great number of hilarious chase scenes, pie gags, and cheeky humor.  Why didn't we get THOSE sketches?
  Instead, this dvd is filled with mostly low energy bits that fail to inspire a chortle.  The sound and picture quality are bad too, but the sketches themselves are the greatest insult.  The worst of them is saved for last, when Benny comes out dressed as an Asian man with a supreme intolerance for all races.  The issue of racial intolerance itself is an unpopular one now, but if the bit was funny, one might forgive it as a classic joke from an earlier era.  It's not funny, just offensive.",1207872000,2,671,4.40650406504065

If you remember Benny from cable and PBS, this is a nice inexpensive collection to keep on your shelf.  For serious dvd collectors, the problem with the dvd has to do with the picture quality.  This is a really bad transfer.  Some parts look very grainy as if it was copied from an old VHS tape.  That is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect rating and a full recommendation.",1187308800,4,547,4.201923076923077
595240,4,6303209939,"One factor for the quality of this film being as it is (not the video-to-film transfers which in and of themselves were nothing more than color kinescopes, but the quality of the material) has to do with the fact that this was drawn ONLY from shows produced between 1969 and 1972 (with the rendition of ""Yakety Sax"" as heard all through the picture, having originated from the Dec. 27, 1973 show), and produced/directed by one person, and one person only - John Robins.  Nothing of Hill's work up to that period from other producer/directors - which, up to the point this was prepared, also included David Bell, Keith Beckett and Peter Frazer-Jones - were even considered for inclusion, unfortunately, given that (as some may have suggested) the shows from these ""other"" directors may have been an improvement over what's offered here.

Oh, and one more thing:  In the ""Lower Tidmarsh Hospital Service"" sketch, there was a switcheroo in the music, with the original custom-scored medley as on the original Nov. 19, 1969 airing being replaced with a loop of the aforementioned 1973 version of ""Yakety Sax"" in the outdoor scenes and a stock-music piece heard in the hospital scenes.  This may have had something to do with music clearance issues, from one of two possibilities:  a) the use in the sketch as originally aired of Scott Joplin's ""Maple Leaf Rag,"" given that many Joplin tunes were heard in the then-recently released movie ""The Sting""; or, more likely, b) the last song in the custom-scored medley, a cover of John Mayall's ""Room to Move,"" which is perhaps his best-known tune from his most famous album, ""The Turning Point.""",1186444800,9,1636,4.891696750902527

When we viewed this DVD, we were very disappointed in the content. Most of the skits were very obscure. It contained only one or two of his best quality work. It definitely was a far cry from being the ""Best"" of Benny Hill. As a matter of fact, if it were possible, we would like to get a refund for this item. It didn't come close to being as advertised.

595244,5,6303209939,"I already read about picture and sound quality, from my point of view with Benny Hill shows those aspects don't matter to much.

It's very important to understand, Benny Hill show is old compared to DVD technology so almost every release will has this ""defects"" related to quality. Besides the DVD atmosphere takes you back to the 60-70's, remembering the TV shows that everybody saw at that time.

Now, the content is great, I agree that some sketches aren't to god like others but what the ... one of the best are passengers of love, the first one at the hospital, ""throw open your window"", Tupper show, spuddo, the reverend interview, etc.

Everytime I see this DVD my day turns good, it puts a smile in my face and I can see it again, and again, and again.

I know some people really don't like british comedy {take Monty Python, for instance}, but whoever said Benny Hill playing various roles as women, Robin Hood, another thief, a sheriff, Mary O-hairy, and many others wasn't funny? Of course it is! No matter what Benny Hill plays he's usually guaranteed to deliver some laughs! Within 2 hours, it's all good fun with Benny Hill on this tape, NOT TO MENTION, more than a few babes in there, too. Everything on this tape is set to fit your satisfactions of Benny Hill, occasionally playing almost every character, and  funnier ones in the silent sketches, which are personally my favorite parts. You can relax, and enjoy Benny Hill's silly ways in perhaps, the silliest of any of his stuff.",1125014400,,772,4.804511278195489
595294,4,6303209939,"But, that has always been the case with comedy imported from the U.K., as well as what WE send over there, as well as the rest of the world.  Some of our jokes don't have the folks in Taiwan, Nairobi, or Milan rolling in the aisles, either.

That said, ""The Best of Benny Hill"" is a good introduction to the late comic with his ribald brand of comedy.  Sure, there are some straight slapstick sketches but most fans of his are looking for the suggestively titillating ones and these are in good supply, from his ""commercials"" to his double entendre songs to the AMPLE supply of well-endowed ladies.

The latter is for the fourteen-year-old in all of us guys.

Speaking of the ""ladies,"" the highlight is in the last act when Hill dons several wigs and appropriate attire and ""impersonates"" some of England's most popular (at the time) female singers.

His ""Shirley Bassey"" is priceless!",1114214400,14,885,4.67741935483871

terrific skits

great collaboration of his material put on to one disc

The talk show with the 107 year old man.

The Garden of Love song

The story of the Birds and the Bees (She had the biggest Parakeets I've ever seen!)

595299,5,6303209939,"one of the funniest skits on this tape involves Benny and the gang on board a cruise ship. another favorite of mine is the Chow Mein segments...there's also a nutty skit involving a drunk man at a dinner table among dignified and sophisticated people. yet in another hilarious skit, Benny plays ""Tommy Tupper"", a smooth talking talk-show host who invites a guest on who drops dead...another one, played by Henry McGee, doesn't say anything...and a priest strolls in with his pants unzipped. Benny also plays Fred Scuttle, of course, and this time he's in charge of the fire brigade. with sight gags galore and low-brow british humor, Benny Hill ironically became a favorite among children in his later years {his silent, fast-paced sketches with only the trademark saxophone wailing away became kid favorites believe it or not}. Jack Wright, the bald guy always being slapped on the head, is in this tape during numerous sketches. Henry McGee, in a sketch, plays a talk show host interviewing a French movie director {played by Benny}. the video is 83 minutes long, jam-packed with Benny Hill comedy. no Hill video would be complete without the Hill's Angels. while not as prominent in this as they are in the other tapes, the angels mostly appear in the fast-paced sketches as objects of Benny's obsession. another nutty fast-paced sketch involves Benny as a butler...Jack Wright as a groom and a Hill's Angel as the bride. whenever Wright's back is turned, Benny and the bride fall behind pieces of furniture and make out. Wright catches the two and the butler's kicked out...only to return as someone else the following week. Benny sings ""In My Garden of Love"". this is a great video of Benny Hill. originally released in 1974. It was re-issued 20 years later in 1994.",1079481600,3,1771,4.887043189368771

I happen to like his early stuff from the 70's as opposed to the later stuff he did in the 80's. Lucky for me this compilation movie was made in the mid-70's and has made it to DVD. The skits on this DVD represent the original years of Hill's brand of humor and I love it. The only drawback is that since some of the skits were shot on video the quality isn't as good as the superb quality of the skits shot on 16mm. On the contrary the other DVD(s) available that covers Hill's later years contains the boring, mundane humor in my opinion. I am very much hoping that I can get some more Hill programming on DVD from the 1970's, as presented on this DVD because as I said this is but a mere taste of Hill's early era of original and very funny yet risque humor. There's a lot more he did back in  the 70's which hasn't made it to DVD yet. A lot more.
