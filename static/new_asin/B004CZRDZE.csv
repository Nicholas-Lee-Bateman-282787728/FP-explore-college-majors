8424524,3,B004CZRDZE,"[DOCTOR'S WIVES - (1970)]  After seeing and enjoying 'Such Good Friends' by Otto Preminger, starring Dyan Cannon in a marvelous role, I thought I'd try another film from that same time period with her in the lead and thought this might be the place, even though I suspected this would likely be fromage of the smelliest kind. No such chance. In spite of top-billing and being prominently displayed on posters for this film and flagrantly touted as a her vehicle in its re-release here and elsewhere, Dyan Cannon clocks in just under three minutes of total screen time - WTF? When she was knocked off before the five-minute mark took place, I assumed there would be flashbacks aplenty with her character, as hers was the most pronounced, enjoyable and hand-wringingly foul-mouthed of the five women the film centers around, but no, she's gone for good. What a waste... On another note, I was correct about it being of the smelliest kind...Oh well, one out of two ain't bad, I guess...but a bummer regardless.

A well known and eccentric cast elevates this one from sheer cinematic dumpster-diving for entertainment - it's ridiculously trashy without the graces of being charmingly campy or cult-like, garish with all the guilt left in, tasteless without tact, and as subtle as a bludgeoning. It's as artful as TV is at its lowest ladder-rung (and that's why I didn't enjoy it), nothing but a brash soap opera, a pre-`Dynasty' era flowerbox in sad need of water. That said, those who enjoy cheap, cheesy soap operas with familiar names and little adornment will no doubt love this one. I mean, look how long 'General Hospital' was on the air...it's not still on, is it?

In spite of product details, there's no murder mystery here; we learn immediately who killed Dyan Cannon's character, and he's a despicable SOB, and the rest of the cast are about as sympathy-deserving as Casey Anthony. Even the peripheral characters are no one you'd ever think of socializing with, so I'm clueless as to why I'm supposed to care about the cheating wives clandestine activities - if I wasn't raised (somewhat) properly, I'd contemplate killing them myself. But why stop with just one? Don't get me started...

As for the women involved, Janice Rule is great in her role of the least despicable wife (at least she knows how to dress), and Rachel Roberts turns in a good performance as well. Richard Crenna is adequate in the main male role considering there isn't much to do. There's about as much moral fiber on display here as there is in a South American prison. The major insult was casting John Colicos as the murderer - he's incredibly vile and loathsome, true, but he always is, so you knew was the bad guy, he always is, and he's as embracable as Glenn Beck. And wasting talent such as Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Connor in such small, supporting roles without even giving them one scene each to thrive in was the true transgression. That and killing off Dyan Cannon so criminally early on. A two and a half star flick that should've easily been four with all the talent involved. Makes you wonder why people get married in the first place.

I'd like to state something more positive about this one, but at these prices, someone's gotta look out for the other guy before someone else makes the same mistake I did. 'Not my cup of tea or what I'd place in my flask or snifter. 'Nuff said.",1311724800,10,3378,4.708967851099831
