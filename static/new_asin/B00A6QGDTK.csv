8547052,5,B00A6QGDTK,"Prompt shipping and very nice package....although the source print used isn't anything special.  When this was described as ""restored U.S. version,"" I guess that I was hoping for a pristine source.  Still, it's a nice disc with a couple of nice supplements (1 in German).",1502409600,,271,5.0
8547053,4,B00A6QGDTK,"This PAL DVD plays fine on my computer. It's a pleasure to finally have the complete English-language version of ATOLL K available. This version thankfully corrects a couple of things that are usually seen in the shorter version titled UTOPIA: The plaque for the barrister's office is now in English rather than French, and the insert shot of the bottle of Welch's Grape Fruit Juice is gone. The approximately 18 minutes of new footage doesn't make the film a whole lot funnier, but the overall film is more satisfying since the story makes better sense. And there is a little new footage of Stan and Ollie, so that alone is cause for rejoicing. Suzy Delair is vivacious as the female lead, although it's difficult to fully evaluate her performance, especially with the poor English-language dubbing. Some Laurel and Hardy fans can't bring themselves to watch this film; I'm not going to try to change their mind. But I will say that if you give ATOLL K a chance, you may discover it's a somewhat better film that its reputation would lead you to believe.",1495929600,3,1055,4.739130434782608
8547054,4,B00A6QGDTK,"This is a Region 2 PAL disc.  The entire movie is presented window-boxed, to preserve the original screen ratioand also, I suspect, to ID the source in the event of attempted bootlegging.  The picture quality is not as sharp as other copies I've seen (and no video or DVD edition has come anywhere near the 35mm original-release print of UTOPIA, the edited version of ATOLL K, that I first saw decades ago), but all things considered, it's acceptable.  Since this was assembled from different source materials, there are noticeable shifts in quality.  Noticeable but not disruptive.  (The soft focus makes Stan's sickly appearance look a little less dire.)  L&H fans continue to debate the films merits, or lack of them, but completists will want to add this DVD to their collections.",1461024000,,784,4.9465648854961835
8547055,5,B00A6QGDTK,Seller shipped quickly and safely.  Prior to this release I was lamenting the fact that I may never get to see the full length edit of this film.  I love being able to see it.  I enjoy watching this DVD but don't expect digital audio or digital video quality.  It is what it is but worth it.,1456012800,,291,4.052631578947368
8547056,3,B00A6QGDTK,The print quality of the motion is very good. It is just that Laurel and Hardy look old in this film. It is good though that they released this film on dvd. It is approximately 13 minutes longer than the length for Utopia.,1418860800,3,222,4.186046511627907
8547057,4,B00A6QGDTK,"Runs a little ""long"" after all...but there's alot more of Cherie LaMore...and a little more of L & H! But that's enough to proclaim a winner!

The *real* movie emerges as an intelligent...and *funny* comedy with a message! In some ways, ATOLL K (not really ROBINSON CRUSOELAND or UTOPIA) stands alongside something like DUCK SOUP by the Marx Brothers, considered to this day the greatest social satire.

I have to say that the Disc did not play on my 50 inch TV but did play on my Computer! No complaints!

So this Collector's Dream comes true for millions. Now the movie makes a lot more sense...not that *sense* makes sense for Stan and Ollie. But we still don't learn what...""K."" is! :)",1363651200,3,689,4.631147540983607
