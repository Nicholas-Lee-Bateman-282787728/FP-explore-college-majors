8082063,1,B000B64CXY,"If you really want to learn about the life of Florence Nightingale, buy a biography and skip this tape.  Neither the content nor the presentation is worth investing your time and money.  The production is visually dull; the timing is static; and the script provides little useful information.  There are many assertions made about Nightingale's work and importance but they are not backed up with explanations, details, etc.  Useless!",1125705600,12,434,5.246376811594203
