2899657,2,B000TGUUCS,"The latter-day career of David Carradine offered some remarkable film opportunities to the former ""Kung Fu"" hero. Sure, with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-Two/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume Two</a>, these were mostly low-budget DTV releases, but they nevertheless let him explore a variety of roles that true fans ought to be eager to investigate. One of the more ambitious projects he undertook during the last four years of his life was a two-part TV miniseries set in 19th century China, directed by TV veteran David Wu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snow-Queen/dp/B00007G1VR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snow Queen</a>). Disappointingly, even though this miniature epic had the potential to be a TV masterpiece like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/1574925628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arabian-Nights/dp/B00005NB94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arabian Nights</a>, it wound up being a fairly mediocre adventure, the biggest asset of which was Carradine himself. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the prominently-featured costar, then you'll be hard-pressed to find reason to sit through its three-hour entirety.

The story: a retelling of ""The Prince of Baghdad"" prompted by a young Caucasian street urchin named D.B. (John Reardon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin-s-Apprentice/dp/B000E1YW2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin's Apprentice</a>) seeking fortune for his underground family of street children. When foreign princes congregate to compete in treasure-hunting quests for the right to marry the local governor's daughter, Princess Wei Li (Desiree Ann Siahaan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marco-Polo/dp/B000PE0GXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marco Polo</a>), D.B. poses as a nobleman so he can gain access to the palace and steal treasure...but eventually, his growing feelings for the princess and his rivalry with the underhanded Mongolian Prince of the North (Rupert Graves,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Madness-of-King-George/dp/B00005AUJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Madness of King George</a>) urge both him and his accompanying mentor Bird (Carradine) to broaden their ambitions at great personal risk.

For a movie shot in a single location (Heng Dian's ""TV City""), ""Son of the Dragon"" has a wide scope: while the characters always end up returning to the palace site, you get a sense of having traveled a good distance inbetween scenes, with the forests and rivers and mountainsides all looking authentic. With that said, for a film that relies heavily on art direction, the aesthetics are solid but not striking: occasional moments of visual grandeur are undermined frequently by plastic-looking interior sets and costumes that look like...well, costumes. Even more disappointing are the two CGI centerpieces that are well below the standards of what can be accomplished on television: the stone dragon coming to life and the magic carpet flight require both low standards and the ability to loftily suspend disbelief, otherwise you'll be rudely jarred out of the mood of these two supposed high points.

Speaking of the mood, it's also a bit faulty: despite being an archetypical adventure tale with a vague socio-historical message concerning orphan plight and racism in China thrown in, the story feels extremely superficial and un-heartfelt. Though nobody in the cast (which also includes Theresa Lee as D.B.'s crush and Kay Long Tim of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-The-Bruce-Lee-Story/dp/0783226985/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story</a>&nbsp;as the governor) gives an outright bad performance, few performers seem capable of playing their role past the two-dimensional stage. Then again, this could be due to the story itself being fairly untied: aside from not really becoming exciting until the second half of the show, the entire magic aspect is essential to the story but so poorly explained (why does Bird have an evil twin? - how can the Mongolian prince utilize a nameplate like a voodoo doll?) that there will be plenty of head-scratching going on by the time the credits roll.

No Carradine outing could be complete without a healthy dose of martial arts, but even here the bag is mixed: Siahaan and Lee have a beautiful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>-esque sparring session early in the movie, but nearly every encounter afterwards can be overlooked, culminating in a very disappointing one-on-one bout between Carradine and Eddy Ko (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PTU-Police-Tactical-Unit/dp/B0010X7432/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PTU: Police Tactical Unit</a>) which is pretty much just two old fogies trying to look spry as they mime their way through a swordfight. In the end, the entire movie feels like a mime-job: while I admire the obvious effort that's been put into trying to make this film appear grand, the filmmakers had clearly tackled a project that's too big for them and therefore resorted to keeping everything very exterior and shallow...neither of which a film of this length can afford to be.",1265673600,12,5657,6.852777777777778
2899658,4,B000TGUUCS,"I liked David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine, but not too much otherwise.  He was okay in this, but the movie was very good regardless of any actors corny lines and a bit cheesey acting.  The scenery and landscapes were outstanding.  The colors and photography again, outstanding.  It was ALMOST like a big budget movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the filming.  The story was simple and really drawn out, but the visuals more than made up for that, and the story was not bad, just shallow.  That said, it was in the style of the old Chinese made Kung Fu movies, shallow stories, and the fight scenes too.  To their credit however, they were not bloody battles, and that I was grateful for.  All in all, I can't say anything bad about it and I would watch it again in the future.  I would recommend this movie to others.",1261958400,5,829,4.437086092715232

2899660,5,B000TGUUCS,"Son of the Dragon is another super production staring David Carradine. His acting and action are superior and highly entertaining as always. Keep up the great work, Mr. Carradine !!! The whole cast did a great job.",1235433600,,214,4.8108108108108105
2899661,5,B000TGUUCS,"David Carradine is still mentally and physically in shape at 70 years old! This man has been making movies for over thirty years! Son of the Dragon is an epic movie that is almost 3 hours long. However, there is a mixture of humor and good martial arts action that makes this a true classic for the future.

I rate this a five star movie-",1223942400,13,338,4.2

8209361,5,B000TGUUCS,"I am a fan of martial arts movies even though most of them are ""cheesy"" and cheaply made. I bought this one mainly because of David Carridine. I was very surprised by the movie. This was an excellent movie. The story line is good, the actors and actresses were very good, the scenery was beautiful and the fight scenes are well done with a minimum of ""flying"" and other typical kung fu gimmicks. There is some of that stuff but it doesn't overwhelm the scenes. The movie is rather long but I enjoyed it every bit as much or more than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. If you are a martial arts movie fan you will really like this movie. Buy it and enjoy!",1413331200,2,651,4.300813008130081
8209362,3,B000TGUUCS,"I have been an enthusiastic fan of anything to do with the martial arts for more than sixty years.  I also enjoy Asian martial arts movies and I have seen and written reviews on many of them.  I am also a fan of the late David Carradine and lately I have watched several of his movies. I have enjoyed viewing all of them, but  I was somewhat disappointed in this movie DVD (Son of the Dragon) in which they attempted to make an almost three hour epic film but failed in spite of some of the colorful scenes.  David Carradine plays the teacher (Bird) of a young thief played by John Reardon (D.B.).  The story begins with D.B. stealing even though his teacher has attempted to teach this immature boy differently. As usual, David Carradine was believable and interesting, but his co-star John Reardon was terrible and I intend to avoid ever seeing this actor in any future movie.

Carradine also takes care a group of homeless poor children and the story centers around D.B. attempting to pass himself as a royalty because he fails in love with a Princess.  There are numerous tests Carradine and Reardon must pass in order for them to win the favor of the Princess.  I found most of the action scenes lacking and three hours was way too long for this movie. Some of the fight scenes were okay, but not great.  If this movie was cut down to 90 minutes it might have been a better movie.

If you enjoy long colorful martial arts films with poor acting by the supposed hero you might enjoy this film.  Personally, I found it to be one of the most boring martial arts films I have ever seen lately.

Rating:  3 Stars and I am being generous.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths)",1396656000,,1685,4.428571428571429
