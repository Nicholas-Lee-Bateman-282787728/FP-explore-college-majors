Don't get it if you're looking for great dramatic values, but do get it if you want to chuckle a lot and remember what movies used to be like.  You'll fall in love with Myrna Loy as Morgan le Fay, and will wish she wasn't such a baddy.",1239667200,,384,3.8974358974358974
383124,5,630194299X,"Will Rogers was hugely popular during his time, but the years have not been kind to him and he is largely forgotten today. Thankfully, years ago there was a VHS series of Rogers' films released available for viewing. Here we have one of the most famous of his films, A Connecticut Yankee, the story of a man sent back to the Middle Ages when King Arthur ruled. The Mark Twain story has been made many times, but this one deserves recognition.

Rogers plays a radio man who is sent to a dark, scary house to deliver a battery for a radio. When he gets there, he finds there are strange goings on and the man of the house wants to use the battery to transmit sounds from the past into modern times. Suddenly, a flash, and Rogers is being discovered by a knight of Camelot. Believed to be a demon, he is sentenced to death, but Rogers manages to convince the king of his power by ""causing"" an eclipse of the sun. Merlin is quite jealous, but Rogers is knighted as ""Sir Boss."" He introduces many inventions like telephones, automobiles, and automatic rifles which come in handy when the king's sister (Myrna Loy) decides to kidnap the princess (Maureen O'Sullivan) and wage war against them.

The whole cast is great, but Rogers is the true star. He delivers his lines with a nonchalance that makes everything he says even funnier. His average-man persona makes him enjoyable to absolutely everyone. He has a sense of humor and confidence, but he isn't pretentious in the least.",1180656000,3,1474,4.579545454545454
383125,5,630194299X,"As a major Will fan, this movie is my favorite.  The charm of Will Rogers shows through more than in other films.  The random politcal jokes that pop up do not seem so ancient

383126,2,630194299X,"Not a good version of mark Twain's tale at all. Rogers gags are badly dated and the ending with the modern tanks in the Middle ages war are a bit much. This is bad as it's (unacknowledged) 2001 remake ""Black Night.""",1019260800,,215,4.2682926829268295

Eddie Albert and Janet Blair have better voices than I had realized.  They do full justice to such standards as ""My Heart Stood Still"" and ""Thou Swell"".  The show includes one of my favorite songs, ""My Night to Howl"", which demonstrates Richard Rodgers' extraordinary gift for melody and Lorenz Hart's clever lyrics.",1436313600,,436,5.477611940298507
7817580,5,630194299X,"This was absolutely delightful.  Too bad it was only an hour of it.  Neil Simon (said the credits) helped write the TV adaptation, which I hadn't known, and which may account for the very funny dialog.  ""To Keep My Love Alive"" was sung before Martin ever went to Camelot.  Only 2 of its riotous 4 choruses were sung (I expected it to be shortened), but it was good anyway, and I know the song and have Segal singing it on CD, so it didn't matter to me.  Since in one song ""hell"" was changed to ""heck"", it's not surprising ""On A Desert Island With Thee"" was cut.  I loved it.  It may replace ""Pal Joey"" as my favorite Rodgers & Hart show.  A few negligible glitches in the print.  No commercials.",1421020800,,695,4.244274809160306

7817582,5,630194299X,"Loved this trip through time to the 6th century via the mid 20th century. Ever since I first listened to the original cast album of Miss Liberty, I knew Eddie Albert was a great singer, so I'm glad that I now have a visual depiction of a singing Albert. Also, being a fan of Boris Karloff, I was overjoyed seeing him as brother of the fiancee/King Arthur. And you can't go wrong with Rodgers and Hart in my book, so having this production of one of their greatest musicals gets me all goose-pimply. All that, and the original commercials makes you think took a trip back to March 12, 1955 (although it would be a more seamless trip if the commercials were inserted back in the spots where first presented).",1392508800,,706,4.438461538461539
7817583,4,630194299X,"When his fiancee (Gale Sherwood) catches him with an old flame (Janet Blair) at his bachelor party, she hits the groom to be (Eddie Albert) over the head with a bottle. When he wakes up, he finds himself in King Arthur's (Boris Karloff) court in Camelot. Mark Twain's novel A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT has been filmed several times including a 1931 film with Will Rogers and a 1949 musical with Bing Crosby. This version in based on the 1927 Broadway musical by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart (the Crosby musical was not based on the Rodgers & Hart show). The show was heavily altered for a 1943 revival with some new songs and this version harkins back to the 1927 version but keeping some of the new songs from the 1943 version. All versions play fast and loose with the original Twain novel. This one's plot is rather lame and clumsily executed. But oh those wonderful Rodgers & Hart tunes: Thou Swell, To Keep My Alive and My Heart Stood Still among them. Directed by Max Liebman. With John Conte, Bambi Linn, Rod Alexander (who also did the choreography) and Leonard Elliott as Merlin.

The VAI DVD is from a kinescope of a live broadcast so there's not much contrast and the transfer is on the soft side but it's eminently watchable and sounds good.",1356652800,2,1272,4.578947368421052
7817584,5,630194299X,"Whoever thought of putting these on DVD should be congratulated! What a way to preserve them and get them out to a waiting and willing audience. My interest in musical theatre goes a long way back and it's so great to see theswe shortened versions that TV did in its hey-day. It also give us a chance to see someone like Eddie Albert in something other then what most people know him from : Green Acres. Now I'm not slamming that show, I think it's a comedy classic, but these actors started somewhere and here it is! Let's hope more of these TV musicals get redone. It also shows how a major BDWY musical can be cut down to 90 minutes or less and still keep its integrity.",1342224000,6,673,4.265625
7817585,3,630194299X,"A Connecticut Yankee, 1931 film

The movie begins at radio station WRCO where singers perform. Will Rogers provides entertainment (a standup comedian). ""Times are Hard but So is Your Old Man"" is the next song. There is a spooky place that has a cash customer for a radio battery [as opposed to store credit]. It is a dark and stormy night with thunder and lightning. A young woman wants to get out of the house. Another woman asks Hank Martin questions. Radios then operated from large batteries. Great weather? Can old sounds be recovered from the past? [No.] Will Hank have a strange dream? He is back in the Days of King Arthur! We see a castle on a hill. [Painted scenery.] Hank is brought in at the point of a lance. A condemned man is led away. [No defense lawyer?] Hank is chained to a wall. King Arthur inspects Hank, who is not well-spoken. A cigar lighter produces fire! Sorcery? ""Burn him."" Hank is condemned.

Hank has a pocket notebook with the dates of eclipses and uses this to impress his captors. Merlin offers his wise advice to the King. Hank's incantation is followed by an eclipse of the sun! The King beseeches him to restore sunlight. Hank is dubbed ""Sir Boss"". This spoof shows telephone operators. The magic of advertising will make people spend money they don't have for products they don't need. [Still true?] Sitting next to the King? Sir Boss speaks strangely. Sir Sagamore throws down his gauntlet to challenge Sir Boss. The people watch the battle. A lasso against a lance? Now Sir Boss will be sent to rescue the captive Princess. The page is dubbed Sir Roger de Claremore! They will ride against Morgan Le Fay. Merlins shows his trickery in betraying King Arthur! Knights in armor are lifted onto their horses. They ride off on their mission. First Sir Boss  will try negotiations. But they are ambushed and captured.

They are brought before Morgan Le Fay. Arthur is thrown into the dungeon, Sir Boss will get a different treatment. [His outfit is from the 16th century. King Arthur and his daughter are imprisoned and won't be released. Sir Boss is handy with his six-shooter. They are captured and sent to the gallows. Clarence was asked to come to their rescue with jalopies and tommy guns. Morgan begins the hanging, one at a time to prolong this gala festival. But an autogyro in the sky drops bombs on the castle. The invaders attack with rifles and tommy guns to defeat the enemy. ""Whither thou goest?"" An explosion saves Sir Boss. Then Hank Martin awakes from his dream! The radio broadcast about King Arthur ends. Hank runs away from this old house. He helps two people to get away, and walks in the rain.

One advantage of this fantasy comedy is seeing Will Rogers acting and commenting on current events. He is not as good as professional actors, but has unpolished charm. It is an example of what entertained people in the early 1930s. Have changing tastes affected its appeal? Some might quibble about the story, but it is worth watching once.",1318118400,,2990,4.666034155597723
7817586,5,630194299X,"You begin to realize how really great the ""Golden Age of Television"" (the 1950s) was when you view this delightful production from the Max Liebman Presents series of ""television specials"", but released by VAI. A few months ago VAI released a similar production from the Liebman series - ""The Desert Song"" (with Nelson Eddy in a rare TV appearance) - but this one is even better!

""A Connecticut Yankee"", based on Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" was written as a musical by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart in 1927. They revised it again in 1943, and it opened on Broadway just five days before Hart died. This TV adaptation (with four adaptors including Neil Simon, early in his writing career) was presented LIVE on NBC TV in 1955. Thankfully these broadcasts were captured on kinescopes (films taken from TV monitors) so they can be enjoyed today as well as for future generations.

The show is really timeless, beginning in the modern day - at a wedding - and traveling back 1500 years to the Age of Knighthood. There are lots (I mean LOTS) of puns in bother the script and Hart's lyrics and it will often remind you of the recent smash Broadway hit, Spamalot. For the 1943 production Hart wrote the macabre lyrics to ""To Keep My Loved Alive"", while classic songs like ""Thou Swell"" and "" My Heart Stood Still"" are here too. Since the Oldsmobile commercials have been nicely excised, the 90-minute show runs 77-minutes. And it goes by fast.

The cast is superb with Eddie Albert - who many know only from the TV series ""Green Acres"" where he couldn't display his singing talents - and Janet Blair in the leads, followed quickly by Gale Sherwood (who, along with John Conte, appeared in The Desert Song) and dancers Bambi Linn and Rod Alexander (also in TDS).

The print is more than passable with a stray dust mark - on the original kinescope, I assume - appearing on the left side of the screen at various points. The sound is just great.

Overall, this is a wonderful production and VAI should be thanked for making it available on DVD. The only problem is that now I can't wait to see what other Liebman productions have been preserved and know how long before VAI gives us more of these. Life is way too short.

A must have for American Music Theater fans.

7817587,5,630194299X,"This 1955 live telecast was presented as part of the series Max Liebman ""Specatculars."" It has a great cast: Eddie Albert (Martin), Janet Blair (Sandy), Gale Sherwood (Morgan Le Fay), John Conte (Sir Kay), Beverlee Dennis (Switchboard Operator), dancers Bambi Linn and Rod Alexander (Alexander is also the choreographer), and Boris Karloff as King Arthur. The whole production is put together with great refinement and spontaneity. Adapted for television's time limitations, there is just one significant loss: ""On a Desert Island With Thee"" is gone. But nearly the rest of the score (in the 1943 version) is intact, including first-class stagings of some of the bigger numbers, like ""Ye Lunchtime Follies"" and ""The Camelot Follies,"" and beautiful renderings of the biggest hits, ""Thou Swell and ""My Heart Stood Still.""
