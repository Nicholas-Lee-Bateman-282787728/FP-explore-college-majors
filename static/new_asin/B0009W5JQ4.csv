8067795,1,B0009W5JQ4,"I have a new theory about bad movies: we should ban flashes - backwards, forwards, sideways, whatever.  It would wipe out half of the bad movie industry and slim the other half down to a reasonable hour at most. The Psychic AKA Premonition would be culled down to about five minutes.

The movie begins with supposed anarchists wearing presidential masks breaking into a lab facility.  They have a mission - to intimidate the scientists there to stop experimenting on animals.  Or are they?  In truth, they're there for a far more sinister purpose...a purpose that, had the movie actually had any ambition, would have kept the viewers in the dark.

Instead, The Psychic reveals what the intruders were doing in the first fifteen minutes.  They were actually terrorists out to retrieve ""Cobalt,"" an important ingredient in building a massive dirty bomb. Mystery?  Who needs a mystery when your protagonist is psychic?

About that psychic: Casper Van Dien is police detective Jack Barnes who, after a near death experience in the military, returns with the power to see the future. He and attractive wife Kate (Catherine Oxenberg) struggle to deal with his newfound powers.  His son R.J. is played by walking zombie Kyle Jordon Drewitz, who doesn't do much but nod and grunt. Barnes is a loose cannon, always going off half-cocked and giving captain Gloria Smith (Lorena Gale) fits. The lead terrorist is Nazir (David Palffy) who is so evil that he - GASP! -- shoots his minions when they fail. For some reason Vargas (Earl Pastko) shows up at random moments as a sort of Psychics Anonymous convention to commiserate with Barnes.

This movie is bad. The special effects, which involve explosions and helicopters, are terrible.  The acting is subpar.  The plot simply gives up on unspooling a coherent story and just explains everything.  When it's not beating the audience over the head with its rote plot, The Psychic gives us visions of the future with multi-colored shaky shots of future scenes.  No wonder Barnes' premonitions give him headaches.

Because it has to fill its television running time, The Psychic never knows when to quit. So when Barnes escapes a building loaded with explosives and the conveniently portable case of Cobalt, it's inevitable that his son will slip out of the poorly-rendered CGI helicopter, dangle from a chain over a terrible green screen effect, and then the camera will focus on Van Dien's hand slowly pulling his son to safety.  To complete the clich&eacute; madness, the pilot should have been shot by a dying terrorist, forcing Barnes to crash land the helicopter while being talked through it by his - heretofore unmentioned - pilot-trained wife.

Here's a dystopian vision of the future of B-movies: I just created a more innovative plot writing this review.",1298937600,2,2799,4.982795698924731
8067796,3,B0009W5JQ4,"""The Psychic"" was a USA network TV movie originally titled ""Premonition.""  Jonas Quastil who has done a number of horror genre films including ""Scourged"" directed.  There is a pesky bullet hole in the left shoulder of Van Dien's jacket that keeps disappearing and reappearing out of sequence, but aside from minor continuity issues, the film works fairly well.  It was written by Will Stewart who has the wonderful distinction of playing Crackhead #2 in ""Training Day.""  Casper Van Dien who I best remember as Brom Van Brunt in the Johnny Depp film ""Sleepy Hollow"" plays police detective Jack Barnes who experiences death and comes back with psychic powers.  Van Dien does a good job, except for one moment when he's shaking Dexter Manning and his eyebrows arch like, ""Won't you just be a good guy?""  His real-life wife Catherine Oxenberg who also starred with him in ""The Omega Code"" plays (SURPRISE!) his wife Kate.  She doubts his new abilities and gives him a hard time about it.  Kyle Jordon Drewitz plays their son RJ, who winds up kidnapped.  [spoiler alert] Just when you think the worst is over, he forgets to put his seatbelt on and falls out of the helicopter.  Lorena Gale who had a small part in ""The Fantastic Four"" plays the police Captain Gloria Smith.  She does well in the picture with the limited range she's asked to play.  Earl Pastko plays Vargas, another psychic who keeps following Van Dien around.  David Palffy does a good job as the scary boss Nazir who shoots his friends just to prove a point.  John Tench played Redneck #2 in ""Brokeback Mountain"" & here plays the klutzy assassin Goran with flare.  Paul Anthony has nice but limited moments as Dexter Manning who gets manhandled by Van Dien's Jack Barnes.  ""The Psychic"" is certainly a ""B"" movie, but the action keeps our interest for the most part.  Enjoy!",1213920000,8,1837,4.744479495268139

8067798,5,B0009W5JQ4,"I am giving this movie 5 stars because of the actor Casper Van Dien. He is right fine to look at and have enjoyed his movies that he has acted in if nothing more than to just look at him. This movie is an ok movie with bad special effects. The plot was a good one, but was a failed attempt to execute it. It is worth a watch for entertainment and being a fan of Casper.",1169856000,7,369,3.8051948051948052
8067799,3,B0009W5JQ4,"A straight to DVD release that's as predictable as this year's Oscars (except for CRASH of course).  Real life hubby and wife Casper van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg star in this tale of a young cop who ""dies"" and is brought back to life---with strange premonitions that all come true.  This includes an earthquake, a train wreck and an explosion, and of course, a terrorist attack as well.  Van Dien tries to convince his wife and police chief (a sturdy Lorena Gale) that these visions are real, and he even stumbles onto a mysterious man who says he has them too.

The special effects are right cheesy, and the whole movie reeks of cheepo, but it's entertaining on a subliminal primitive level.",1141689600,9,695,4.672131147540983
