1404827,3,B000059H88,"If you cross the three genres horror, soft porn and family drama you get Zombie Lake. It was probably hard for the distributors to find an audience for this one. None of the genres work very well in this film expect the nudity of course. But it tends to be more comical than erotic especially in the scene where the female basket team baths nude in the lake. The music in that scene must be heard to be believed. Howard Vernon, who plays the mayor, gives the film some dignity it maybe don't deserve. This is much worser than Oasis of the Zombies and the zombie make-up is so bad you won't believe your eyes. It's so bad it's hard to think intelligent people has made it. But at the same time it's entertaining to watch so I give it three stars anyway. Fans of bad euro films may like it, but others probably want to stay away from it.",993600000,19,835,4.225

If there were an award for the worst film of all times, this would be my nomination. Everything is bad from the beginning. The story itself is so stupid, that even a child would laugh at it. It is especially funny, when a braindead nazi zombie saves his daughter from another fellow monster! The directing, the camera work the clothes are all simply ridiculous. To make matters worse this horror movie is not scary at all! The English dubbing is totally out of synchron with the original French speech, which only adds to the horror!

1404830,3,B000059H88,"Mr Keetch should check his facts. Directed by Jean Rollin, an interesting footnote director....mmmmm",985737600,,100,6.214285714285714
1404831,3,B000059H88,"It is very rare that film can be genuinely called 'unique' but it is a description that can genuinely be applied to Zombies Lake, for this film, directed by J.A. Laser, is unlike any other in the history of the cinema. ...The story is simple; a small village in France, or Italy, or Belgium, or Spain, is invaded by Nazi soldiers during the second world war. Wreaking havoc, they earn the enmity of all the villagers, with the exception of one young girl. Stalked by a German soldier, within a few minutes she falls passionately in love with her would-be attacker.
But then the villagers exact their revenge. The soldiers are stormed and their bodies disposed of in a local lake. There is much rejoicing throughout the village, except for the young girl now pregnant by her beloved storm-trooper.
The child is born, thirty years pass, and we are now in modern day - or, at least, the late seventies- but the little girl is, confusingly, still only eight years old. Life is idyllic and quiet in the village until the Nazis start to claim their revenge, but this time No More Mr Nice Guys. Or even Mr Live Guys. Whenever anyone is foolish enough to dally beside the Lake, zombies in once-smart uniforms rampage  - but terribly slowly.
A passing female basketball team who frolic happily in the lake to an instrumental cover of Finland's entry in the 1972 Eurovision Song Contest come to a very nasty end.
The story mainly follows the common banal route of monsters munching their way through extras, with the stock cast of female journalist desperate for a story, cynical police, pompous mayor etc. But towards the end a bizarre twist emerges with the development of a would-be touching relationship between the little girl and her dead father. A scene where she feeds her zomboid dad fresh blood from a bucket is truly bizarre.
In the end, good old napalm saves the day.
The camera work is reminiscent of You've Been Framed; the direction non-existent; the editing of the ""oops, me scissor's slipped"" school; the acting is, at worst, peculiar, and, at best, downright peculiar; and the dubbed dialogue defies the English language - and the actors' lip movements. The make-up involves painting the face green, and a liberal use of Rice Crispies and Copydex, whilst continuity and period detail are, frankly, useless. Also the underwater scenes clearly betray the floral tiles of the swimming pool where filming took place.
But is it scary? That's the whole purpose of a horror film, after all. Zombies should be foolproof as they capitalise on our horror of death, plus our fear of the familiar becoming treacherous. However, the circumstances of viewing are a major factor. If this had been watched at 2 in the afternoon, sun streaming through the windows, cherryade in one hand and kebab in the other, and in the company of a few friends, then chills would be in very short supply. On the other hand, watched at midnight in a large inexplicably creaky house, thunderstorm in mid-fulmination outside, some weaker, over-imaginative souls (e.g. me) may be forced to keep the light on that night, crucifix and flame-thrower to hand.
But should children be allowed to watch it? Of course not. They are far too sophisticated and would much prefer The Exorcist. But the important question facing society today is: would it inspire violence in the viewing public? Only against the director.",984009600,6,3382,4.841105354058722

  Start with a woman stripping nude, sunbathing, then skinnydipping in a no swimming area (breasts and Bush are constantly visible as well as several momentary vaginal area shot while she frog kicks). This wakes a extremely badly make-up job zombie who attacks her pitifully and her attempts at escape are even more laughable as she is free several times and seems to be swimming right back at the zombie. Zombie then goes on a rampage killing 1 person.
  The movie goes into backstory. Handsome nazi saves French woman. She falls in love. They have barn sex.  Full female nudity is shown. 9 months later the Nazis return to area. He has a new daughter woman's is dying from illness due to childbirth.  Nazis leave are ambushed (best part of movie, looked like old war film) all die and are dumped in water.
  More girls arrive at lake. Get full nude and skinnydip. More zombies wake. Finally bus load of female volleyball players arrive at lake.  Get nude and skinnydip. All the zombies wake up.
  Touching scene zombie meets daughter.  Zombie leads others into trap.  Town flamethrowers zombies.  Girl cries. End movie
  Some of the later zombies have decent make-up.  Lots of full naked women. Several vaginal shots while girls are swimming.  This movie is a dream come true for a pubescent 12-13 year old.  Tons of nudity and no realistic horror scenes to give you nightmares.",1452816000,,1568,4.737037037037037

Non infecting zombies that bit the neck like a vampire and the victims just die and that's it. They did not even put up a fight, just seemed to wait to be killed once touched.

1404864,4,B000059H88,"This is a laughably bad movie that gets worse as it goes along.  Of course thats what I liked about it.
Apparently, during WW2, some French resistance fighters killed a squad of Nazis and threw there bodies into a lake outside of town.  Now 10-some years later, the zombies are coming back to grab and kill mainly naked girls/women who apparently don't wear underwear often(always a plus).  The zombie make-up is basically green paint with a couple of dime-store scars thrown in for good measure.
It gets even better when you find out that one of the zombies had an affair with a French woman he saved before being killed.  This resulted in a daughter being born.  The zombie father remembers the house and recognizes his daughter and doesnt kill her. Also, the only person smart enough to have a suggestion on how to kill the zombies, is a reporter doing a story on the ""Lake of the Damned"".  The ending is so bad, i had to laugh.
There is plenty of full frontal nudity. The opening credits start off with a young girl skinny-dipping and ignoring the danger-death signs at the lake.

1404885,3,B000059H88,"I disagree with the reviewer who stated that this film was worse than Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space.  However, it certainly is bad enough that I was laughing in places that were not intended to be funny.

Other reviewers have mentioned the bad makeup and several other issues.  One continuity error (of many) not mentioned in other reviews that I laughed at was that one of the dead Nazis had his boots stolen by a town person, but later all of the zombies have boots on.

The music must be heard to believe how bad it is.  I cannot imagine ever shopping at a supermarket with music that bad.

There certainly is plenty of gratuitous nudity starting with the woman during the opening credits.

The bad acting is also funny.  The guy with the pipe overacts and the townspeople are able to follow the director's instructions about where to stand, but that is about the limit of their skills.  I also laughed at the ""zombie shuffle"" that we get to see plenty of, some of which looked, to me, like it was the same footage reused (e.g. the boot shots as they stagger by).

I rated it three stars due to the unintended humor.  I enjoy movies when they are bad enough to be unintentionally funny.  If you do not, stay away from this movie.",1382918400,,1236,4.39647577092511

They are feasting on the locals, and smearing them w/ green make-up as they dine. The town's mayor (Howard Vernon) is on the case, using a (very) lengthy flashback sequence to get us up to speed on Nazi-zombie history. It all started w/ a romance-gone-awry. I never knew the German soldiers were so gentle! We are shown the massacre that led to the zombie curse on the town-folk. Watch in horror, as the poor Nazis are stripped of their footwear, and tossed into the drink! This is why the pond is now known as ""the damned lake of the damned"". The somber, utter seriousness of the plot is heightened by the senseless slaughter of the all-girl, all-naked volleyball team. Can anyone blame the underwater-undead for taking their sweet time rising up beneath these frog-kicking young lasses? Certainly not! Soon, all of the zombies are wobbling along on dry land, looking for victims. One touching scene features a reunion between zombie dad and his smiling daughter. Then, there's the bar brawl, the backyard bathtub, and on and on! Anyway, if you crave female nudity every 5-10 minutes, and like your zombies in uniform, then ZL will shoot you over the moon!

1404895,4,B000059H88,"Zombie Lake is a complete hack job, which was written by Jess Franco and directed by Jean Rollin after Franco bailed. For years Rollin refused to admit he made this film. If this is the only film by Jean Rollin you've seen don't judge him on this as he actually made a lot of good films, with Grapes of Death being an excellent movie. I'm not sure I can say this is so bad its good, but it is so bad its entertaining. Just sit back and laugh at the hack job. The film is set in the 50s, but nothing is done to make it look like the 50s, which led to people making more fun of the film thinking it was set in the 80s. There's tons of female nudity and in the underwater shots you see everything. Surprisingly there is very little gore. If you enjoy low budget shlock Zombie Lake might fit the bill. You'll either find it a total boring hack job or a fun hack job.

As for the extras not much here except a couple of trailers, the opening scene with English credits and 2 alternate scenes without any nudity, which in the actual film itself are nude scenes.

As for the transfer Redemption did an amazing job perhaps better than the film deserved. Too many times I see cult films of the 70s and 80s with ok transfers. They might look better than their DVD counterparts, which sadly due to that gets a passing grade when we should demand better. The transfer for Zombie Lake is a knockout; there is grain, white specs and various print damage, but colors pop, clarity is great and this is just a great transfer. I've seen various horror and cult films on BD and this is one of the best, which puts films with a bit of a bigger budget to shame and Redemption also puts some major studios to shame when they have far more money to spend. I really cannot believe how great the video looked. When it comes to these transfers too many people say its an older film only so good it can look, which allows companies to give a decent enough transfer, but not as good as it can be. If Zombie Lake can look this excellent no excuses for any other cult films to not look as good if not better.

As for the audio you have to 2 options; one English dub and one French track (also dubbed since it was shot with no sound) from what my ears hear the tracks are nearly Identical. There are portions where one audio has a bit more of a kick behind it, but besides that to me they were identical. A film like this can be watched either way. The French track while the film is still poor it makes it a little less silly perhaps, but a film this bad the English dub helps provide plenty of laughs (the French track does as well). So a film like this really doesn't matter how you view it. Each has something going for it. Normally I prefer the track, which is actually be spoken, but in this case I think I prefer the English dub since it helps add to the odd charm Zombie Lake has.

Quality wise Zombie Lake is a winner and I can name several films with a bit more of a budget and or put out by major studios with far more money to spend and yet Zombie Lake trumps it in video quality. If you're a fan of this film the disc is a must own for the great video and decent audio despite the lack of features audio and video make up for it. Zombie Lake is easily one of the worst films made, but I find it great fun though some just find it a hack job. Like I said if you've never seen a Jean Rollin film except this seek out Grapes of Death as it shows he was a filmmaker with talent even if you can't see that here.",1366761600,4,3488,4.080174927113703

1404897,4,B000059H88,"The first time I encountered Jean Rollin's `Zombie Lake' must have been around 2005 and I have to admit I didn't know exactly what to make of it at the time, mainly because back then I was just beginning to dip my toes in exploitation waters. I couldn't really describe it as a `good' movie (whatever that means), but the fact that I never quite could get it out of my head and I could very much remember entire scenes from the movie had to count for something, especially because there had been countless `better' films I've seen since then which I also liked but could hardly even remember a single thing about. When I saw it again a year ago, I was mostly wondering how this movie could look on blu-ray, because I had already seen how much difference there could be between the old Rollin DVDs I used to see and the way they looked in hi-def.

And now here it is, one of Rollin's most infamous movies in glorious hi-definition and I have to say the difference is even greater than I expected! As with the other Rollin movies, what changes most in the transition to blu-ray is the fact that these movies tend to look a lot less amateurish now. Which is obviously relatively speaking, because `Zombie Lake' can never truly disguise its low budget origins, nor should it - it's one of the distinct charms of this oddball movie. But as always I have to part ways with those who see a movie like this strictly as a cheese fest, good only for a superior chuckle. I suppose it is because in creating a distance people can feel superior and therefore safe, but in my opinion it's one of the most reductive and even harmful ways of watching trash. But I guess it's just too hard for most people to truly engage with something - looking at something from a safe distance is always easier than getting your hands dirty yourself. Which is not to say a film like `Zombie Lake' should be treated in an extremely serious manner, because taking the laughs out of exploitation is taking the life out of it, but I've just never quite understood why people cannot laugh WITH those movies instead of AT it.

Anyway, seeing a movie like `Zombie Lake' looking as good and film-like as it does now on blu-ray is a blast. And as I said before, it makes even something like `Zombie Lake' look almost respectable: the war scenes for instance always looked so threadbare as to be almost insulting and while they still don't look quite like `Saving Private Ryan' they do look more like conventional filmmaking now. Apparently, Rollin wasn't very much interested in the project, but I'm not sure if this is still very much visible on the screen anymore, because while it may still be a notch below his best work, it's peppered with his trademark lyricism and goofball charm. The subplot between the zombie father en his child remains one of the most baffling in film history, uneasily situated as it is between seriousness and parody, complete with a lyrical love theme by composer Daniel White, which seems to have been shamelessly lifted from `I'm Always Chasing Rainbows' - a rather appropriate choice for this subject matter. In the end `Zombie Lake' is as indefensible as it is unforgettable.

1404898,3,B000059H88,"Redemption continues to release the old Eurocine catalog which was available over a decade ago on DVD from Image Entertainment.  Now we have French Director Jean Rollin's troubled zombie excursion 'ZOMBIE LAKE' aka 'LES LAC DES ZOMBIES'- 1981 which was first given by Eurocine Producer Daniel Laseour to Director Jess Franco who co-wrote the script but was passed up because he was already involved with his own living dead opus 'OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES' aka 'LA TUMBA DE LOS MUERTOS VIVIENTES'- 1981 also available on Blu-Ray from Redemption.  This film is a bit different which involves a small European town being besieged by murders of young women and a secondary storyline involving a curse which is enabling the living dead soldiers to arise.  The mayor of the town is played by Franco stalwart Howard Vernon who brings a touch of class to the proceedings but is bogged down by the poor makeup effects and rushed direction.  There is also a touching undercurrent with the daughter of one of the zombie soldiers who confronts her zombified father but the age difference and time element of the situation leaves the viewers scratching their heads. Scenes of the zombies emerging from the water of the lake predate the scenes from Ken Wiederhoren's 'SHOCK WAVES'- 1977 and Director George Romero's 'LAND OF THE DEAD'-2005 but thats not saying much when you see the production values.  Director Rollin would film zombie flashback scenes for Director Jess Franco's excellent 'A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD' aka 'CHRISTINA PRINCESSE DE L'EROTISME'- 1971 when Eurocine decided to re-release the film the same year as 'ZOMBIE LAKE' to replace some soft core footage so the Franco/Rollin link would continue for a while. The only saving grace to this production is the wonderful photography by Max Monteillit who would also lens Rollin's finest zombie film 'THE LIVING DEAD GIRL' aka 'LA MORTE VIVANTE'-1982 and the beautiful performance by Anouchka who plays the daughter of the zombie soldier.  Franco's favorite music composer Daniel White has his work pilfered as fans will recognize excerpts from Jess's masterpieces 'THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF'- aka 'GRITOS EN LA NOCHE'-1961 and 'FEMALE VAMPIRE' aka 'LA COMTESSE NOIRE'-1973 peppered throughout the film.  Originally released in a poor transfer on VHS by Wizard Video back in the Eighties, Redemption releases the film in a nice 1080P transfer surpassing the Image DVD with English/French Subtitled Audio options and trailers to other Rollin releases and Franco's 'OASIS' its only extras. The price, however, is a bit steep so if you already have the DVD from Image Entertainment, you may want to think about an upgrade.  Director Jean Rollin does try to give the material some kind of life (no pun intended) but unfortunately the film emerges as an oddity only recommended to zombie film fans who want to see them all (like me).",1364083200,,2875,5.063424947145878

What is it great for? A man's night out in the basement, cooler of drinks and microwave pizza readily available.

This is not a movie to watch for the suspenseful plotline, no... Make it clear that heckling and laughing at the filmograhpy is the essence of the experience.  This movie is so contorted with logical flaws, that it is truly impossible to imagine being real in any sense of imagination.  It strikes me as being a film that was created for a collegiate film class as opposed to a serious venture intended to make millions.

Here are some of the cons:

* Gross timeline discontinuities.  A twelve year old girl in the late 1970's whom was born during World War II?
* Underwater scenes show swimming pool walls, drains, etc.
* Camera, lighting, audio cables, come into view throughout the movie.
* Actors fall out of character by poorly hiding their giggling at times.
* Cameras/lighting/crew can be seen in mirrors on multiple occasions.
* Blood tubes visible in many shots
* Makeup that falls off or is transferred to victims
* Interior shots are very cramped.
* Townsmen in the movie also play the zombies.
* The actor who plays the mayor must think he's like Grard Depardieu, but lets face it, he's not Grard Depardieu

Everything is fine in undisclosed French village until an entire woman's basketball team goes for a skinny dip. Triggered by revenge and nudity, the Nazi zombies have declared war, will the town surrender, again?

To the reviewers that said the nudity in the opening credits was unneeded, you missed the point of the movie. The nudity was essential to the plot and kept me glued to the screen. I don't want to live in a world without nudity in the credits. These zombies are a brave re-imagining of the classic zombie. For one, they do not infect you and you do not become one of them when attacked. Secondly, they have no desire for brains, they bite you on the neck and leave no marks.

It's been said the green zombie makeup comes off after leaving the lake. You think this was by mistake? Keep those reviews on IMDB, this is a place for serious reviews. It was a metaphor for the fading influence of capitalism in the East.

The battle scenes were great and accurately showed the phasers used during WWII. Many movies incorrectly use modern day gunfire when a German rifle is shot, this movie correctly used the sound of a Starwars laser cannon. It's pew pew not bang bang, Speilberg. I still do not understand how the KKK got involved with this WWII film set in France, but they did and they also had the correct phaser cannons.

Some of the dialog is unnatural, which is why I only gave 4 stars. Each time someone finished talking, I thought to myself, ""What an unusual thing to say."" Also, this is nothing more than a softcore porn with green men and a lake.

1404952,1,B000059H88,"Zombie Lake (Jean Rollin, 1981)

In the seventies and early eighties, one could not have a genre but that Jean Rollin had to contribute something to it, bringing his own special blend of the absurd, allegedly erotic, and silly to the table. Zombie Lake is Rollin's take on the Nazi Zombie subgenre. While it certainly hits new heights (even for Rollin) of absurd and silly, ""allegedly"" is the best word to describe the eros factor.

So anyway, there's a lake, and it's full of zombies, as we find out in the opening scene, when some chick decides to go swimming and gets munched. (As that's the extent of her role in the film, there's not much else to say about her.) Her boyfriend heads into town looking for her, and, of course, here comes the horror movie trope of the crazy old man warning him about the creepy crawlies whilst everyone else tells him to shut up. Also, coincidentally, a reporter is in town looking to do a story on this mysterious lake. So, yeah, everyone seems to know about the mysterious lake except the munching victim's boyfriend. Then along comes a womens' soccer team who like to get naked and swim. Now, while all this is going on, there's also a touching zombie father - human daughter reunion. Folks, you can't make this stuff up unless you're Jean Rollin.

I'm not one to disparage Rollin's films simply because he made them; some of his output over the years was quite enjoyable. This is not one of those movies. Rollin, who spent most of his horror career doing erotic vampire tales, subscribes to the belief that zombies look best when the makeup used to determine who's a zombie and who isn't consists of some green foundation and dark circles under the eyes. (Which doesn't look that much different from some of the members of the women's soccer team...) If there's a zombie movie clich, it's in here somewhere, and then there's that whole girl-befriends-zombie subplot that's so far beyond ridiculous I'm not even sure where to classify it. An absolutely ludicrous piece of filmmaking from start to finish; watch Shock Waves for the umpteenth time instead if you're craving Nazi Zombie goodness (and don't we all, now and then?)

It's supposed to be taking place in the 1950's but it's hard to tell because the clothes and cars are from 1980 the year this movie was made.  It was made on a shoestring budget and it's a bad movie but if you like bad horror movies and many of them are , then this isn't the worst movie of all time.  I believe it was directed by jean rollin who is a french director under a different name. This is a FRENCH HORROR MOVIE not a italian one.
He makes alot of french horror films that usually feature vampires.  Jean did the best he had with no budget and  it does however have the great late howard vernon in this movie.  He graced many a low budget horror flick and whatever he's in he adds his classy presence at least.  I personally thought the zombie father reuniting with his daughter added pathos to the movie and made it a little better flick than if that scene wasn't in the movie. I don't think that we should be overly critical of lowbudget horror movies after all we live in a time where lowlife  rappers are held up as talented.  If you want to see a good jean rollins movie watch the Grapes of death or Fascination.  Jean rollins always likes to add nudity to his movies and that's in this movie in abundance.  Because the europeons are ages ahead of us in tolerance of nudity it was no big deal to have nudity in a zombie movie in 1980.  This is one of three movies in which zombie nazi's attack people and this one was influenced by the much better shockwave from 1976 and was contemporary with the lower budget Oasis of the zombies.  Making this a loosely related trilogy , and that if you cut it some slack is enjoyable for what it is: a very low budget nazi zombie in the lake movie.",1220227200,,1820,4.150997150997151
1404955,5,B000059H88,"Someone had really taken the time to think this through and create synergies out of pure concepts ...

For example, in the opening scene, you have:

1). a beautiful scenery in a late afternoon.
2). a beautiful lake in France, ducks swimming.
3). a beautiful natural looking girl in her early 20's with no makeup, natural long hair and long legs with a pair of short walking down the woods, she is careful in stepping around the logs so she doesn't fall down and gets hurt.
4). Mixed this up with a studio musician showing off his/her beautiful jazz keyboard phrasing in a double octave style of Antonio Carlos Jobim against a slow walking base line ...

and you have a synergy that creates value for the viewer.

Even in the very opening scene where you only see the pond and the duck, with nothing else, by mixing the beautiful jazz keyboard with an orchestra in the back (or may be some fancy synthesizer); it signals to you something beautiful is about to happen; then the movie follows with a beautiful girl coming to your company, she is careful that she doesn't get hurt dripping down the woods, she could be your daughter, your lover etc.

And if that doesn't doing it for you, she also takes off her cloth ...

This is American for you, they really know how to make a movie.  Note: she doesn't just takes off your cloth, she looks around and make sure no body is around first ...

Firstly, this only gets 2 stars from me because of the nudity; other than that the movie is simply laughable.

The special effects are horrible. The acting is something you'd expect from foreign films made in the 80's. The make-up is a bloody joke! The ""zombies"" are nothing more than guys in Incredible Hulk-colored make-up wearing something that's supposed to be a Nazi uniform. (in one scene, an underwater zombie has an eyeball painted over his closed eyelid; guess the actor couldn't open his eyes in a tank-as opposed to a lake, where the scene was supposed to have been) The zombies attacking people are pathetic too as the zombie is clearly ""spitting"" on their victim; emptying his mouth of blood-stuff on the victim's neck and smearing it around with his lips (some good editing might have fixed this problem).

The storyline is a little flacid too, especially when you consider the movie being made in the 80's and the Nazi's being around in the 40's. How long ago what the film supposed to have taken place? Says ""present day"" in the film, so I assume it was the 80's; all the other information proves that. I must have missed something.

I fast-forwarded a lot of the movie. And I only got it because I thought it was a movie I saw as a kid that freaked me out. It certainly was not.

From the start it was clear that I was going to despise the flick, although the full frontal nudity in the beginning wasn't half-bad. WHy anyone, especially a female, would want to skinny dip alone in a old secluded lake is beyond me, but we get  alot of that here. In fact,ther's one sequence where a group of seven girls, just finish a basketball gameand decide to get fully naked and take a dip in the lake. Although this was supposedly set in the 50s it was clearly made in the 80s, and I guess bathing suits weren't a necessity back then. The story revolves around a town that's plagued by rumors of missing people around the 'lake of the damned' a name dubbed after a number of German soldiers were massacred and thrown into the lake. The story behind the lake goes back to the timesof the inquisition where the lake was once thought to be a place of sacrafice to please the gods, and without one, they will rise from the depths of the lkae wrecking all sorts of havoc. This leads to our dead Nazi rising from the lake and doing harm to anyone who decides to trespass; apparently they weren't properly sacraficed. There a 20 minute sequence explaining everything, or more specifically, showing us what happened since there's little to no dialogue throughout the entire sequence. In fact, there are many scenes in the movie that have no dialogue, which probably wouldn't have done the movie much good anyway, especially with its incredibly slow pacing. There are even some scenes that last entirely too long, while others are just poinless. Whether it was intentional or not,there a funny scene involving a zombie returning home to greet his daughter(who wasn't born when he died),giving viewers what we want while watching a zombie film -- faimly bonding and much needed dramatic pauses. Speaking of dumb zombies, the basic make-up is green -- yes there are no huge gashes, or clearly rotted flesh, but instead we have zombies that are just a little too moldy . On the plus side, there is a decent part in the film where the zombies decide to run amok in the town, although you wouldn't know it since it was way too damn dark to see what was going on, which was another continuing occurrence thoughout the film. You hardly guess this was a zombie movie since there was zero gore. Thats 90 minutes of my life I will not get back.

At the very least, I should be entertained by the pure cheesiness of the film....WRONG!!

This movie is bad!

ZOmbie movies rarely have a plot(Romero's films aside) and that's usually OK.  But, this film doesn't even have a point and that is not OK!  The opening scene consists of a woman, walking down to this lake by herself, stripping and jumping in.  This goes on for like 10 minutes.  Then she is pulled under water by what I am guessing is supposed to be one of the zombies.  You would not know that though, because this 'thing' is so un-scary.  Anyway, people in town notice she is missing.  After 3 days they decide to call the police(Hey, nothing like taking quick action) and after another week or so, the police actually show up; just to be murdered the first day they are there.

The town gets a visit from a reporter, who is dead-set on learning as much as she can about the lake, from the mayor.  He tells her the story of the Nazi soldier who made love and had a child with one of the townsfolk.  HE was later murdered, along with his unit, by some members of the French ""Resistance"" and their bodies thrown into the lake.  Now, they are terrorizing the town, some 10 or 15 years later.

This film might have had some promise.  But, it is just plain terrible.  The soundtrack sounds like music you would hear while shopping at a supermarket.  The zombies look more like people than most of these weird extras they cast to play the townfolks.  Oh, and this film must have been shot in 1 day, since everybody, including the mayor, is wearing the same clothes at all times in the film.

Please, even the hardcore B-movie fans will find this one tough to sit through.  If the lack of tension doesn't turn them away, the reunion of the zombie father with his daughter most certainly will.

Good Luck!",1124668800,7,2146,4.388324873096447
1405015,2,B000059H88,"Wrong.  Let me make something clear before I begin my review:  I am basing my rating along the same lines as other Zombie b-movies as it would be impossible not to.  With a title like 'Zombie Lake' most would assume that it is a must for Zombie/Eurotrash dvd collectors.  Personally, I found it to be a rather forgettable flick.

Here's why:  Even for a Zombie b-movie, the film offers little in the way of entertainment.  Allow me to make my tastes clearer - if you watch these films for over-the-top gore/death scenes, funny dialogue (by this I mean that it was actually meant to be taken seriously), and threatening music (the kind that lets you know someone is about to get their head ripped apart) then chances are, you may not enjoy this one.  ""Zombie Lake"" has the bad dubbing (can it possibly be good if done in another language?), bad acting, and inconsistencies present in other Zombie flicks, but without the other qualities that usually make these movies fun to watch.  The synopsis and poor makeup that has repeatedly been mentioned in other reviews, I will skip only to write about how much I tend to like these 'bad' movies and yet found this one to be too dry.

I understand that none of us really watch any of these flicks for the plot but it seemed like there was an attempt to cross Zombie flick, love story, and long-lost family reunion in this one movie.  Horrible combination.  If you like your fair share of T&A in your films, then this one doesn't disappoint.  The film at times feels more like a soft-core porn movie than a Zombie one.  Sure, this is yet another quality most of us need in our Zombie flicks, but coupled with the ice-skating music, one must wonder where all of this is going.  Don't get me wrong, everything has it's place and the nudity in this movie is all it has going for it.  Despite all this, Zombie aficionados may be sorry they picked this one up.  If there is another Zombie film you've been wanting to check out, do that before seeing this one.  The film didn't really start getting interesting (aside from the opening credits ;)) Until about 35 minutes into the movie and dragged at other times after.  I'm not saying this movie doesn't have it's value; the underwater shots of the girls are great!  All i'm saying is, don't expect a fun movie for the sake of Zombies!  I bought this movie with the hopes of celebrating bad film qualities, being entertained, and witnessing cheesy death and carnage.  I found none of this in the movie.  Then again, if you don't expect too much based on some of the other reviews and go into it expecting a long-lost love story with several guys with green faces biting people in the neck with no apparent bite wounds, you may like it.  All I can say is that you really can't expect anything you've seen in the Italian flicks, and if you think this movie is worth checking out because of most of the other reviews on the nudity and overall 'bad'ness of it, then by all means buy it.

The film takes place in France around the 1940's during WWII.  A couple of soldiers are killed during battle.  Fastfoward to 1980.  Around a lake, a number of females are being killed everytime they take a swim (naked of course).  It turns out that the killers are the dead soldiers, who turn out to be zombies.  It is up to the local mayor to keep the peace and stop the chaos.

This is by far the worst movie I ever purchased.  Everytime it shows the zombies underwater, you can tell it was not filmed in  a lake.( It was filmed in a pool!!!).  The part with one of the soldiers who come back to see his 10-year old daughter does not make any sense:  If his daughter was born in the 1940s, she should be close to 40 years old, NOT 10!!!.  And let's not forget the music.  It is very annoying and degrading.  Not the mention the acting.  Even a badly dubbed Fulci movie would be 10 times better than this.

Again, if you want to see a zombie movie, skip this one at all costs.",1103500800,3,1210,4.146551724137931

On this particular saturday afternoon, we rented some movies including this one ""Zombie Lake"" and man, did it scare me! I truly had nightmares for the longest time about this film, maybe it was the way they walked (the zombies of course!), their expressions on their faces, their strength, and them coming out of a lake..Oh my god, We had a lake close to wear i used to live!
Now fast forward to 2004..i'm 28 years old now and don't really get scared watching horror movies anymore but still love them and watch as many as i can, the good and the bad.
Well this is REALLY BAD!
The story is poorly written and full of mistakes , the make up on the zombies are laughable (halloween make-up at Wal-mart is state of the art compared to this), the dubbing is horrible and i just love when the actor is finished talking but the voice is still going on (funny!), the editing was horrible, and just when you thought zombies didn't have feelings..well watch the film, they do and they even cry!
I guess it's funny that what scares us as kids makes us laugh when we're adults...that's life i guess!
In conclusion, Please AVOID this film, i watched it really for memories of when i was a kid, but now i'm having nightmares that i actually spent $20 on this waste of time.

1405050,3,B000059H88,"As a fan of Italian horror/zombie movies, I wasn't sure what to make of this French release when ordering it. The price was right however so I decided to give it a try. While not the worst film I have ever seen, it was completely different from Italian Zombie flicks. The violence is toned way down. Even when someone is killed there is a limited amount of blood. There are other noticeable things about the movie that only took me one viewing to notice such as: the underwater scenes of the zombies were obviously filmed in a pool (you can see the side wall in the background), the time line is way off as a former Nazi solider who died during the war could not have an eight-year-old daughter 35 years after World War II (this part really amazed me) and as mentioned by other reviewers, the makeup was poor (it would rub off when the zombies attacked someone).
That being said, it was different and it was worth the price ($9.99) although I'm glad I didn't spend $20 or more on it.
It was nice also to finally see a film by Jean Rollin, a director I have heard of but had never had the chance to see any of his works.

1405052,1,B000059H88,"Yes, this gets the golden turd award formerly held by Bruno Mattei's stupid-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt ""Night of the Zombies.""  ""Zombie Lake"" commits the cardinal sin of being an underwater Nazi zombie movie that's not only ineptly made, but incredibly boring and unconvincing, as well.
Okay, the movie starts with a prolonged scene of a nude girl who gets attacked by a zombie in a lake (uh-huh).  Then, so help me, the 'plot' starts to unfold (*yawn*).  A dim-bulb reporter wants to do a story on this small town's 'haunted' lake (slow news week, I'd say), and the Mayor (goggle-eyed Howard Vernon) reveals, in a long, ponderous flashback sequence almost completely devoid of dialogue, that he and his buddies (who, surprisingly, haven't aged at all) killed a bunch of Nazis during World War II and dumped them in the lake.  So now, these Nazi zombies live in the lake, periodically coming out to chow down on the town's slow-witted residents.
Visually, the film resembles Lucio Fulci's ""Demonia,"" but director Jean Rollin (who appears in a brief and pointless role as a police inspector) manages to screw things up royally.  Umberto Lenzi made his zombies run around and brandish weapons in ""City of the Walking Dead,"" which is laughable, yes, but Rollin commits another cardinal sin in giving his undead Nazis the power to reason (evidenced in the one-on-one 'zombie fight', plus the lead zombie's devotion to his 8-year old 30-year old daughter).  Also, the green pancake makeup is really pathetic-looking; it's overstated in some scenes, and lacking in others.  And perhaps the final straw is the lack of convincing gore; Euro-zombie movies are notorious for a generous helping of blood and guts, but here it's all hampered by a budget that probably ran in the tens of dollars.
From one zombie fan to the next, and all parties in between, save your money for a competent film from the Fulci or Romero camp.  ""Zombie Lake"" doesn't even work in a so-bad-it's-good way.",1033948800,4,1971,4.9696048632218845
1405053,5,B000059H88,"Ed Wood's films (particularly Plan 9 From Outer Space) are widely considered to be the worst ever made. That is absolutely untrue. Zombie Lake makes Plan 9 look like Seven Samurai or Lawrence of Arabia. It is without doubt the worst film ever made. It has to be. It must.
I will not give a synopsis; other reviewers have done that. I will instead share some of the treasures contained in Zombie Lake:
1) A beautiful, nubile young woman is completely nude during the opening credits. Yes, this must be a record; full frontal nudity during the opening titles!
2) The zombies' makeup is of the 99 cent, K Mart variety.  The makeup rubs off on the victims' bodies, and as the film progresses, washes off of the zombies. By their final emergence from the lake, one zombie's face is completely devoid of makeup.
3) During one shining, glorious moment, the camera operator can clearly be seen in a mirror.
4) The female ""basketball"" team, emerges from their VW bus and begins to play with a volleyball.
5) Said female team begin disrobing, and reveal that none of them are wearing underclothes (and they just came back from practice). In fact, none of the women in the film wear underclothes, except for one young woman who is taking a bath (the tub conveniently located on her lawn).
6) One member of the team gleefully strips off all of her clothes, and enters the lake still wearing her shoes. She must be a modest young lady. In the very next scene (an underwater shot),her shoes have miraculously disappeared.
7) The underwater shots are obviously shot in a pool. Canvas has been draped over the walls of the pool, and the ripples and folds of the canvas are completely visible.  A light and drain are also on full display.
8) The dubbing was done by the worst actors who have ever lived. They speak their lines with all the enthusiasm of a ninety year old lung cancer patient.  The ""rallying the town"" scene perfectly illustrates this and stands as one of the high points (?) in the history of bad cinema.
9) The daughter of one of the zombies is eight years old. She was born thirty years previous.
All right, that's enough. Trust me, there is much more to be seen in this film.  Any aficionado of bad film must not only see this film, but buy it as well.  I have watched my favorite scenes over and over again, and they just improve with each viewing.

1405057,1,B000059H88,"The movie starts with a young woman being pulled down into the lake by a zombie (after having the camera zooming in on about every inch of her naked body, that is). After that, the villagers and the mayor get worried, and another woman is killed in the village. Soon, a female reporter arrives, and convinces the mayor to tell the lake's history. So far, the movie has been about as bad as the average bad movie, and at least you could laugh at the bad dubbing.
The story of the lake is told in flashbacks. Or, at least, the mayor was supposed to tell the story of the lake, but the flashback starts out telling the story of a German soldier and a female villager who falls in love and produces a baby, Helena. After the love story, the German soldiers are killed by some of the villagers and dumped in the lake.
Those flashbacks felt like they were about five hours long. I guess it was more like fifteen or twenty minutes, but it was way too long and dull anyway. This is where you first start to lose interest in the movie. If you're still watching the movie after this, you will witness what is probably the stupidest attempt ever at combining horror and melodrama. Here, the soldier I mentioned before, who is now a zombie, gets out of the lake to visit his daughter, Helena. She doesn't seem to notice that her father is wearing German uniform and is all green in his face. She's happy to see him, and he gives her a necklace of some sort that he got from her mother in the way-too-long flashback sequence. Also these scenes are way too long and, totally stupid and not even funny. The young actress playing Helena makes (with help from the girl who dubbed her voice) what is probably the worst acting performance I have ever seen in a movie.
After that, the villagers are trying to kill the zombies with napalm or something. At this point, it was impossible to pay much attention to the movie, because it was so boring and I couldn't wait for it to end. After about 87 minutes, it finally did...
I don't think I have ever seen so much incompetence gathered in one movie. The acting is awful, the screenplay and narration makes it extremely boring and the ""special effects"" could be made by any ten-year-old. The worst thing of all, however, is the zombie make-up. It has to be seen to be believed (but don't watch the movie just because of that).
To sum up, this is not one of those bad movies that are fun to laugh at. This is just boring and bad in every way and there's nothing good to say about it. Avoid this movie!",1014163200,,2527,4.3446088794926006
1405058,1,B000059H88,"Ugghh. I was pretty sure Werewolf was the worst horror movie ever, until I saw this one. It's about a lake filled with Nazi zombies. They're supposed to be green, but their hands are flesh tone, and the green latex junk is peeling off of their faces. So, it starts off with a scene involving a nubile, bikini-waxed girl who shows up at the lake to---c'mon, you know this one---go skinny dipping. This scene is complete with porno style music and camera-freindly shots of every inch of her naked body. Then, the zombies swim up from their green slop to kill her. This, by the way, is the high point of the movie---after this it REALLY gets bad.
The dubbing is the worst I've ever seen, complete with as much superfluous profanity as possible. The special effects---oh dear God. At one point, when the zombies are in their supposed ""lake"" you can see the walls of the swimming pool in which their actually floating. You see them maul naked or half-naked girls over and over, with fake, thinned blood spurting from wounds with no actual puncture-points.

7933264,3,B000059H88,"This is supposed to be a horror movie and as such it is worth a single star only. Not so great acting or script or plot. I would have normally tossed it. HOWEVER! It was hilarious. the zombie make-up was frog-green paint applied only to the faces, chests (at least one guy) and hands. with dark circles around the eyes. I'm not sure what sort of paint it was but it wasn't staying on. One moment a guy had a totally green face and in the next moment there was hardly any paint visible. These zombies also don't blink and with their wide open eyes and green faces it was pretty comical. When they moved they rarely bent their knees. One walked with his arms up looking like he wanted to surrender. Watching them walk was pretty funny in of itself and there are lots and long sequences of just watching them walk. When the zombies emerged from the lake, they were soaking wet but completely dry in following scenes. When they killed people they apparently drank their blood rather than eating the bodies. The blood looked like tomato soup. In one scene, after the zombie kills a young woman, as he is getting up you can see the lady's throat--no injury at all just a little fake blood. Later they tried to make it look like her throat had been torn out with some pretty bad make-up. Her distraught father showed all the emotion of a brick. Surface swim scenes are done in a lake or pond but the underwater scenes were done in a swimming pool. This is more comical as the group of young ladies who are attacked are standing in shallow but as the zombies grab them from below they in deep water (swimming pool). It takes the mayor a while to call the police but it doesn't really matter. The two detectives are promptly killed by the zombies--no more police involvement. We also can't ignore the love story. During WWII, a German soldier saves a young woman during an air raid by jumping on her--he is wounded. I'm not sure how a bomb going off behind him would cause injury to his forehead, he was also wearing a helmet. He and the young lady become lovers and she becomes pregnant. The one sex scene was also amusing. With his mouth closed the guy is just rubbing his face over her neck and chest. Months later, as the Germans are retreating, he stops in to say goodbye. He looks at his baby and then leaves. For reasons unclear mommy dies shortly thereafter while lying in bed. The soldier rejoins his comrades and they drive off. Later they are ambushed by partisans and killed. The partisans throw their bodies into the lake. Apparently this lake was a place of black magic in the past and thus our zombies are born. Daddy zombie finds his daughter and protects her. At one point, he fights another zombie in what is a hilarious scene--no zombies don't kill each other, they apparently get bored with the fight and then go off in search of blood. At any rate, daughter is happy to have a zombie dad and zombie dad is happy to have found his child--I think, the guy's face doesn't show any emotion but he doesn't eat her. When the cops fail, the locals ambush the zombies but their bullets have no effect. Later, daughter tricks the zombies, including zombie dad, into a barn where the locals fry them with what looks like a homemade flamethrower. Last comments are about the battle scenes from WWII. Explosions are flashes of fire (gasoline or something else) with puffs of smoke. They sound like firecrackers. There is a winter battle scene with just the Germans running around in white snow suits that look-like they were made from bed sheets. How they move is comical. Some are hopping at times. There are ""explosions"" after which some guys fall down but are helped back up and off they go. These guys also had no idea how to fire weapons. The nudity is basically young women swimming naked just before they become zombie food. These scenes are also comical.
