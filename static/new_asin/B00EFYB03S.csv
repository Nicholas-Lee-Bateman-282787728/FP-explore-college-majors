20 years after WW2 ending a old Nazi-Scientist (Dana Andrews) has to bring back dead Nazi-Soldiers to build up a new Nazi-Army.

The good thing: its a nice small sci-fi/horror flic.
The not-so-good-thing: Dana Andrews might be to big for this movie
nice: handsome looking Philip Gilbert
not so good from today view: the ""horror"" is gone
Very good: the picture quality is pretty good (clean and sharp)

Trivia:
Edward Fox (his most popular role might be ""The Day of the Jackal""!) can be seen as one of the ""living"" Dead as the Brother of Dr. Norberg.

FAZIT: a nice small trivial sci-fi/horror Low-budget-flic for fans of this kind of movies and fans of Edward Fox/Dana Andrews but nothing else",1414368000,2,792,4.888059701492537

5912011,5,B00EFYB03S,"Dana Andrews was and is the king of the detective film noir movies. Laura and Boomerang and Reasonable Doubt and his best
movie which is a mix of film nor/horror/sci fi is a must have for any fan. This movie is actually better than it sounds. It's typical of
british horror/sci fi movies but the plot of frozen Nazis and Andrews as a scientist gives it a comedic tone at times. Andrews is
good as usual but his phony Germany accent gets funny at times. He should've used his great cool voice he was known for.
I guess the director thought it was a good idea but Andrews does fine as the german scientist. A cool rare Andrews movie.",1404604800,,631,4.310924369747899
5912012,3,B00EFYB03S,"Dana Andrews was having trouble with his health when they shot this movie.  It is a bit disappointing as far as this genera goes.  It you can get it cheap enough or rent it, I would do it.  I don't mind as I have a pretty large collection.  I think this was a pretty low budget film, so it is what it is.",1391731200,,304,3.7777777777777777
5912013,1,B00EFYB03S,"Apparently the producers didn't know they were making a horror movie. Boooring. It's a shame Dana Andrew s appeared in this, must have been hard up for money.",1390348800,,158,4.678571428571429
5912014,5,B00EFYB03S,"Great flick. Upscaled to 1080i makes it really shine. Look for a stage hand on the left of the screen behind the wall that holds all the arms. This is at the 1:32:33 mark, don't know how they left that in, it's so obvious.",1386806400,6,222,4.068181818181818
5912015,4,B00EFYB03S,"THE FROZEN DEAD is another one of those movies that made an impression on me from seeing it on the small screen. By the time it was released (1967) I was in high school and had discovered British horror but I still had my roots in really low budget American horror movies. This film managed to capture something of both. It was made in England but the plot was recycled from 2 classic American cheapies made in the early 1960s, MADMEN OF MANDORAS (THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN) and THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE. FROZEN DEAD had a bigger budget and like most Brit horror films set outside of the Gothic tradition, it was played straight without a hint of camp. Many horror fans prefer the over-the-top approach but, like the classic supernatural stories of the 19th and early 20th centuries, I find the less is more approach to be more substantial and a lot more satisfying.

Like the two other movies I mentioned, this film deals with keeping a detatched head alive but here it's more than just that. There are arms and entire bodies that have been kept frozen while Nazi scientist Dana Andrews (complete with a fairly convincing German accent) attempts to revive them. The key subplot involves his daughter's friend (Kathleen Breck) whose head, after an assault, is being kept alive to aid in the experiments. The look of the head with it's exposed brain under a glass dome and the helplessness and quiet suffering of the victim, make this a movie that once seen, cannot easily be forgotten. Check on the user comments on imdb to see what I mean. In addition to the head, a  key scene involves the aforementioned disembodied arms. Long unavailable, THE FROZEN DEAD was made back-to-back with IT!, the Roddy McDowall Golem movie.",1383609600,19,1725,4.708609271523179
5912016,3,B00EFYB03S,"All in all it is a good movie as many of the early horror or SySy movies were, well most of them. The DVD has good sound and the picture is very good. The plot, well I leave that for you to find out. Don't want to take the fun out of watching the movie. The best part of this movie is all the twist and turn that take place before the mystery is solved. The actors do a good job. You'll never figure out the ending until it takes place.",1380844800,7,436,3.802197802197802
5912017,5,B00EFYB03S,"Warner Archives has presented a very nice color print of this film, in proper widescreen.  Stalwart Dana Andrews stars as a German scientist who's involved in a secret project to preserve the remnants of the Third Reich.  As such, the movie falls into the ""living head"" subgenre of horror films, but is never quite as campy as the more infamous THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE and THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN.",1377648000,18,403,4.742857142857143

Superb Picture/adequate sound
Would Recommend this fine film.

You've heard of a Coat of Arms in this movie you get a Wall of Arms.
I saw this movie at a walk-in theater years ago and i swore that hopefully i might own it someday.
Well that day has arrived through the good people of Warner Brothers who has made this available.
Her head looks like something out of the Exorcist movie it is a Blue/Green Glow sometimes with a hateful look.
This movie is even sad at times especially when Jean discovers Elsa and what they've done to her.
They don't tell you what happened to Joseph the Butler?
They don't tell you what happened to Tirpitz i can only surmise that Lubeck killed him?
They don't tell you much about Mrs. Schmidt i can only guess that is Karl's sister?",1377043200,5,821,4.401315789473684

8605137,4,B00EFYB03S,"I first saw The Frozen Dead (1966) on American television in the early '70's and later taped it off late night TV in the early '90's. It's a creepy little British horror flick about a human head that is kept alive in a basement laboratory at an old mansion. The head is pretty gruesome, but what I like about this film is the female lead Anna Palk, one of the prettiest things you'll ever see. I'm afraid far less can be said about the head !  (Sadly, Anna died of cancer at age 48 in 1990).",1457654400,,491,4.114583333333333

8605139,2,B00EFYB03S,"I was really hoping for a cool old 1950's horror type movie, I didn't get it with this one. The story was garbage even for the time, the acting was virtually non-existent. Dana Andrews was a Nazi scientist and 20 years later he still is, he had frozen a dozen Nazis and is trying to revive them, he learns there are thousands more and he has to perfect the process. The ones he has thawed are flawed (I rhymed) His niece comes home with a friend and the mad assistant (always are one of these) kills her and they try to keep just her head alive. Pointless and dumb to the point of being totally uninteresting on any level. Dana Andrews must have needed a paycheck, but he was awful too.",1446249600,,686,4.244274809160306
8605140,2,B00EFYB03S,"I confused this film with another, this is an old school horror film but it lacks much excitement or surprise in the story line.
