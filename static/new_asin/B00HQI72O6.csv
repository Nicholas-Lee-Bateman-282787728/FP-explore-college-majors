8634350,5,B00HQI72O6,"Another great story/horror anime! The story doesn't miss a beat, and gets quite involved. Although the main characters are kids/teens, this got me wrapped up in the story and I didn't want to have to take any breaks. That's an excellent show, including horror, romance, real character development, and real relationships, friendships etc.",1458950400,,338,5.39622641509434
8634351,1,B00HQI72O6,"(This review is for The new world parts 1 and 2, the complete series)This is seriously the worst anime show ever. If u enjoy great anime shows like cowboy bebop, outlaw star, elfein lied, claymore and stein's gate then please stay away from this garbage. I purchased this product because of a false review saying it was ""dark/evil""  but it could not be further from the truth. Its just painfully boring, i strongly regret watching the complete series. Not even the few scenes two girls kissing, makes up for how terrible the plot in this show is. Im seriously depressed i sat and watched the whole series, hoping it would get better eventualy, but it did not. 90% of the entire anime is about these tiny creatures called mole rat monsters going to war. If u like watching 10 hours of war between little tiny mole rat monsters, and their stupid rebelion by all means watch this anime.",1455148800,,883,4.5886075949367084

8634353,1,B00HQI72O6,this is a freaky weird show and makes no cense. If your a religious person this is most certainly not your show,1440288000,,111,4.090909090909091
8634354,5,B00HQI72O6,"I love this anime to Hell. One of my favorites ever. No filler at all, characters to love, a story to try to wrap your head around, and a plot twist at the end. Check it out!",1436832000,,174,3.72972972972973
8634355,3,B00HQI72O6,"""From the New World"" definitely feels like a ""new"" anime.  There's something very compelling about its originality and the places it takes you.  There's some plot wandering, filler-melodrama, and anti climactic moments, but not in excess.

This is one of those stories where the young characters are isolated in small town and slowly learn about how the world was, how the world is, and unearth forbidden knowledge that puts them all in danger from their elders.  All of the children have psionic abilities (moving objects and projecting) and they learn at school to harness them.  ""Harness"" being the key word, as children who cannot control their powers seem to disappear.  Surrounding their small village are hordes of evolved rat people called Monster Rats, and they see humans as Gods.  They are a very interesting mystery.  Heck, everything in this show is so I'll stop there.  The joy of the show is the exploration of the detailed world that's been created.

The character design is adequate but animated beautifully.  Movements are full and fluid with no director's gimmicks.  There's a mature nature to the show and one that pulls no homophobic punches.  Girls date girls and guys date guys.  There are no jiggle shots or obsessive panty focusing.  It's all handled very maturely and with a grace.

The show has its weak points.  We're dealing with teens so the melodrama is there and can sometimes be so insistent that it pollutes the otherwise stellar narrative.  Some of the ""big reveals"" don't live up to the intelligence of their premise, but it's only a little disappointing.

I still need to see collection 2.  If it can add more to the New World and keep it from feeling as muddled as part one left it or slap me with a dues ex machina ending, then I'll return to up the stars.

Take a chance on From the New World.  The places where it shines are too bright for the flaws to matter.",1403049600,6,1901,4.714285714285714
8634356,5,B00HQI72O6,"Saki, Shun, Mamoru, Maria, and Satoru are children in a future where everyone has psychic powers that develop during adolescence. They live peacefully in their little, isolated village. Everything is very peaceful. There is no conflict. The citizens are happy. But when the children's curiosity leads them on an adventure that results in them stumbling across forbidden information, this triggers events that could lead the end of the human race....

I was hooked on this series after the first episode. But I didn't realize the ambitious scope of the series until the end. I enjoyed it the entire time, but upon finishing it I was in awe. In addition to a well woven story that spans years (there are three major periods when the children are 12, 14, and 26), it raises some very interesting moral questions and dilemmas. It really makes you think.

From the New World is one of the best Sci-Fi anime I have ever seen and one of the best anime shows period (and I've seen over 400 anime series). The setting is fascinating, as is the explanation on how this new world came to evolve. The characters are engaging and sympathetic.

I watched this series on Crunchyroll, but I can't wait for the DVDs to come out so I can buy them and watch it again :)

From the New World was based on a novel and is 25 episodes long. This set contains the first 13 episodes.",1396396800,9,1357,4.57201646090535
