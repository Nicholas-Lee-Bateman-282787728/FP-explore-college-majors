7989424,1,B0000950VF,"I'm trying to learn Spanish since in a diverse country like America, you can't survive on just English. This DVD has cute female presenters and they tell a lot of jokes, but ultimately, it won't help you learn Spanish. They just present random topics with no logical flow. If you want to learn Spanish then you have to read a Spanish review book and then have practice conversations with other people. Don't waste you money on this.",1473465600,,432,4.623376623376624

7989427,5,B0000950VF,"Load the DVD in your computer or TV DVD player and enter the interactive, amusing world of Standard Deviants. This group of goofy, but lovable, young adults guides the viewer from basic Spanish pronunciation to the more advanced concepts of irregular Spanish verbs. The 4-set DVD pack is a bargain and has over 6 hours of entertainment and instruction that includes lots of vocabulary, grammar and just plain fun with Spanish. Each unit also has an interactive quiz to test learning.

Teachers will love showing this product to their Spanish class as a fun break from dull book work and language drills. Students will want to play these videos at home as an amusing way to reinforce basic concepts in the Spanish language.",1238371200,8,722,4.869918699186992
