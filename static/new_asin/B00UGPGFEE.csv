8705598,5,B00UGPGFEE,"With the help of Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich) a dance hall girl from New Orleans, local ranchers in the town of Bottleneck are being swindled out of there land by the unscrupulous saloon owner  Kent (Brian Donlevy).

Sheriff Keogh (Joe King) attempts to correct this and suddenly leaves town without his body.

Judge Slade (Samuel S. Hinds) who is in cahoots with Kent assigned the job of sheriff to the town drunk. Newly assigned Sheriff Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger) remembers a previous sheriff named Tom Destry and sends off for the son of Destry, Thomas Jefferson 'Tom' Destry Jr. (James Stewart).

On the day of Destry's arrival with all the crowds are waiting in anticipation. Destry steps out of the coach with a parasol and a bird cage. Sheriff Dimsdale thinks he may have made a mistake.

Only time will tell.

I personally think there is more to this film than the surface story and subplots. It has a good after taste.
